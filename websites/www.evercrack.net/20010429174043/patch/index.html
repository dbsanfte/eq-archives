<PRE>
<I>Major changes in today's patch...</I><BR><BR><br><br><br><br>** Food 
Changes ** 
<BR><BR>
- Food items now have a 'duration'. This means that some food items will 
not sustain a character as long as others, and some items will sustain 
your character longer than they did before. 
<BR><BR>
** Bug Fixes ** 
<BR><BR>
- We THINK we've fixed the problem with the Dusty Werebat. This fellow has 
been steadfastly refusing to appear where and when we ask him to. We've 
worked out a deal with his agent, and we think he'll be back to work with 
this patch. 
<BR><BR>
- Corrected an anomaly with hit point bars that occurred when a character 
was healed or damaged by spells. This could be seen, for example, when a 
character was healed and the hit point bar would go up and then quickly go 
back down a bit right afterwards. There was no error in the assignment of 
healing or damage previously, just in the way it was being displayed. 
<BR><BR>
- Fixed the visual bracer bug where other people would see a different 
bracer graphic than you would. Now everyone (including the wearer) will 
always see the same bracer texture. If you have two bracers that have a 
different look (one is leather and one is steel, for example), make sure 
that the one you want to show up graphically is on your right wrist 
inventory slot, because this is the one that the game will choose to show 
for you (unless you take off the left one and put it back on, which will 
show the left one, but that is only temporary, and it will go back to 
showing the right one after you zone or reenter the game). 
<BR><BR>
- Fixed zoning problem in Nurga to Droga that caused characters to be 
facing the wrong way when they zoned, often causing confusion that lead to 
accidentally zoning back the way they had come. You should be facing the 
right way when you make that zone transition now. 
<BR><BR>
** Zone and Quest Changes ** 
<BR><BR>
- The marauding Tar Goos will no longer be assisted by the Geonids. This 
should make at least one quest more available. 
<BR><BR>
- Grobb should now have a couple of ovens. Hopefully this will allow Troll 
bakers to keep their fellows full of carbs and ready to fight. 
<BR><BR>
- Fixed a bug that occurred when selling stacks of items. Previously, if 
you had 4 bat wings and sold them one by one to the merchant, the merchant 
would have 4 bat wings for you to buy, but if you sold all four at once to 
the merchant he would only have one for you to buy. Now he will have 4 in 
either case. 
<BR><BR>
- We have increased the spawn rate of Venril Sathir and his skeletal 
remains. Please note that only Rangers and Druids will be able to trigger 
the spawn for the skeletal remains, and those remains will only be 
dropping items for those epic quests. Hopefully these changes will 
dramatically reduce the competition and resentment over this spawn. 
<BR><BR>
- We have reduced resistances to some spell types on some NPCs in Sky 
Shrine and the Tower of Frozen Shadow. This is the beginning of our 
overview of the resistances of NPCs in Velious. 
<BR><BR>
** Improved and New Features ** 
<BR><BR>
- When you /consent someone it will give them the ability to drag all of 
your corpses. 
<BR><BR>
- You can now buy stacks of combinable items (such as rations, water, 
etc...) from merchants. It works the same way as sell in that you can hold 
down shift to buy a full stack and control to buy just one item. 
<BR><BR>
- Added the ability to change the color of all windows at one time with 
/wincolor (all windows that can be changed, that is). You can now use 
/wincolor ALL 0 0 100 2, for example, instead of having to set each window 
separately. 
<BR><BR>
- Right-clicking items while looting will 'auto-equip' them. This will 
work just as if you had picked the items up and dropped them onto the 
'auto-equip' area of your character profile. So if there is already a 
piece of equipment on your character in the spot where the looted item 
would normally go, it will drop into your inventory, if you have room for 
it. 
<BR><BR>
- The tab key will no longer toggle between you and your last target when 
the chat bar is up. When the chat bar is open the tab key will take you 
through the list of your most recent /tell names or /reply names. When the 
chat bar is closed the tab key will switch you between yourself and your 
last target. 
<BR><BR>
- /assist has an added parameter. /assist on and /assist off will 
determine whether or not your character auto-attacks when you use /assist. 
So if you type /assist off, from that time forward using /assist will NOT 
engage your character's auto-attack. This change will be persistent, so it 
will remain as you left it when you log out. /assist also now has a range 
of 200 feet. 
<BR><BR>
- The destroy confirmation requestor now shows the name of the item you 
are trying to destroy, or it just says money if you are destroying coins. 
This should greatly reduce the chance of accidentally deleting the wrong 
item. PLEASE read the text in the destroy confirmation box to be certain 
that you are destroying the right item before choosing to destroy it. 
<BR><BR>
- Hailing Player Character will now say 'Hail Playername', rather than 
just 'hail'. 
<BR><BR>
- Added /charinfo command. Currently this command only reports the zone 
where the current character is bound. We may add further information as 
things progress. 
<BR><BR>
- You will now see how much damage your character has taken when he is hit 
by a spell that causes instant damage (DOT damage is not reported). 
<BR><BR>
** Item Changes ** 
<BR><BR>
- We've made a change to the Red Scabbard that should relieve most of the 
problems warriors were having with their epic weapon occasionally 
disappearing during conversion between the two-handed weapon and the two 
one-handed weapons. What will happen now is rather simple. The very next 
time you use the container to combine the weapons (or break them apart), 
the old scabbard will disappear and a new one will replace it. 
<BR><BR>
THE NEW SCABBARD AND THE SWORDS WILL APPEAR ON YOUR CURSOR, rather than in 
your inventory. So once you have combined them, make sure to place them in 
your inventory. And don't panic, the items didn't disappear. :) But also 
MAKE CERTAIN THAT YOU HAVE ROOM IN YOUR INVENTORY FOR ALL THREE ITEMS (the 
two swords and the scabbard, which is a container and needs to be able to 
fit into your main inventory). If you end up with a No-Drop container on 
your cursor with no place to put it in your inventory, you will have a 
problem... 
<BR><BR>
Also, right now the new scabbard is a little bugged. Right now you won't 
be able to open the new scabbard until you camp out once after it is 
created. We're working on fixing that bug. We decided to make this change 
even with this small bug to help relieve everyone of the problems with the 
old scabbard. 
<BR><BR>
This new scabbard will have a special ability. It will be able to recreate 
the epic weapons if you have lost them. Simply place a Sword of Runes 
(summoned by a Magician) into the scabbard and hit the combine button. The 
scabbard will convert the temporary power of the Sword of Runes into the 
permanent epic sword. 
<BR><BR>
Customer Service WILL NOT be replacing the old scabbards with the new 
ones. That will be done by the game itself once you have completed the 
quest and combined the swords for the first time. 
<BR><BR>
- Changed the size of the Weighted Axe from Tiny to Large (after all, it's 
a big two-handed axe...). If you have one in a bag now, be aware that it 
probably won't fit back into that bag again once you take it out. 
<BR><BR>
- No Rent Items will no longer be immediately deleted from your character 
inventory upon disconnection with the server. If you are disconnected from 
the servers, or even if you log out, your No Rent items (such as summoned 
food and water) will remain on your character as long as you log back to 
that character within 30 minutes. After thirty minutes those No Rent items 
will be deleted. There may be some extreme cases beyond our control (such 
as hardware failures) where No Rent items will not be on your character 
even if you log back in within the 30 minute timeframe. No reimbursement 
will be given for No Rent items lost in this manner. 
<BR><BR>
- Grand Master Wrist Wraps have been fixed and should now create the 
"Pouch of Quellios" as intended. If you have one of these items and it 
still does not work, please contact a GM using /petition and ask them to 
switch yours for a new one. 
<BR><BR>
- Snow Storm Mask should now function properly. 
<BR><BR>
- The Ring of the Frozen Flame should now be working properly. 
<BR><BR>
- The slow effect on the Willsapper proc has been reduced. 
<BR><BR>
- The weight of Skewers has been increase to a weight of 3. 
<BR><BR>
- Velious Monk armor appearances have been changed. If you're wearing 
these items, you probably already noticed this, but we thought we'd 
announce it anyway. New textures will be showing on the Plane of Growth 
dropped armors and on the questable armors. Because the Velious textures 
can be a strain on some systems, the textures for these new armors will 
not be loaded by default by the game. If you want to see the new textures 
you will have to edit your EQClient.ini and change the line 
LoadArmor23=FALSE (the default) to LoadArmor23=TRUE. 
<BR><BR>
** Trade Skill Changes ** 
<BR><BR>
- Bards that worship Sol Ro will now be able to wear the Imbued jewelry 
made for their god. For those that not only sing around the campfire, but 
sing about the campfire! 
<BR><BR>
- 'World' Trade Containers (those that are stationary) have been fixed. 
Previously when a character tried to combine items in a world container 
that did not match a recipe, the items would seem to disappear. But if the 
character closed and reopened the container, the items were still in it. 
Those items should no longer seem to disappear. 
<BR><BR>
- The speed of Selo's Song of Travel, the effect of the Singing Steel 
Chestplate has been increased a little. 
<BR><BR>
** Spell Changes ** 
<BR><BR>
- Removed Gem component from the following spells. They will now only 
require the metal components. These are the Enchant spells for making 
cultural armor. 
<BR><BR>
Enchant Velium<BR>
Enchant Mithril<BR>
Enchant Adamantite<BR>
Enchant Steel<BR>
Enchant Brellium
<BR><BR>
- Changed the spell component for the following Magician spells from Lapis 
Lazuli to Malachite. They now use the same reagent as every other Magician 
pet spell. 
<BR><BR>
Minor Summoning: Earth<BR>
Minor Summoning: Water<BR>
Minor Summoning: Fire<BR>
Minor Summoning: Air<BR>
Elemental: Earth<BR>
Elemental: Water<BR>
Elemental: Fire<BR>
Elemental: Air
<BR><BR>
- Added Casting Text to the Following spells (the messages in brackets 
will now appear upon a successful use of the spell): 
<BR><BR>
Panic Animal (soandso flees in a state of total panic!)<BR>
Terrorize Animal (soandso runs away in terror!)<BR>
Repulse Animal (soandso is utterly repulsed!)<BR>
Acumen (soandso's eyes tingle) 
<BR><BR>
- Cannibalize IV now exists. This spell is now available in Velious. 
<BR><BR>
- Cannibalize II and III have had their effects improved. They now return 
more mana to the caster than they did before. 
<BR><BR>
** Class Specific Changes ** 
<BR><BR>
- Monk weight allowance has been increased. Every 15 levels monks will get 
an extra 1 stone weight allowance. The post 50 weight allowance has also 
been increased by 2 stone. 
<BR><BR>
Level 15, Limit 15<BR>
Level 30, Limit 16<BR>
Level 45, Limit 17<BR>
Level 51, Limit 18<BR>
Level 55, Limit 20<BR>
Level 60, Limit 24
<BR><BR>
- Disarmed traps will remain disarmed for a somewhat longer time than 
before to allow larger groups to get past the traps before they go off.

** EverQuest Classic Edition ** 

There is a new package for EverQuest. It's a small box with a small price. Here's a bit from the press release for 
details:

---

SAN DIEGO, CA - April 3, 2001 - Sony Online Entertainment announced today that its classic edition of EverQuest(tm) is 
now available for the SRP of $9.99, a price point that will attract new users to a continuously growing community. 
EverQuest, the most successful massively multiplayer online role-playing game ever, will be available in both a jewel 
case and mini box versions at retail stores nationwide. "Newbies" will enjoy all the amazing aspects of the original 
EverQuest from creating their own specialized characters to embarking on perilous and excitement filled journeys 
across three continents.

------------------------------

** New and Changed Features **

- Guild Message of the Day. Guild Officers and Leaders will be able to type /guildmotd to set up a Guild Message of 
the Day (GMotD). From then on any time a member of that guild logs in they will see the message with the name of the 
message sender added at the front, so you will know who sent the message. Any guild member will also be able to read 
the GMotD by typing just /guildmotd and the message will be displayed again. The GMotD will be erased if the server 
comes down, however. You will have to reset the GMotD when the server comes back up.

- /assist changed and improved. It should be much more reliable now. It also will target whatever the assisted person 
has targeted. The assisted person does not need to have auto-attack on for /assist to work.

- Fixed a problem with /corpse that kept it from working on corpses that were too far above or below you.


** Skill Change **

- Foraging changed so that if you are getting the hungry and thirsty messages, your next successful forage will always 
be drink or food. We have also decreased the chance of foraging fishing grubs a bit and increased the chance that you 
will forage water.


** Spell Changes **

- Acumen now overwrites See Invisible.

- Translocate now has the proper spell gem.


** Bug Fix **

- Fixed many crash problems for Windows 2000 users. This fix will most likely also aid some folks that are not using 
Windows 2000 that are having problems.


** Item Changes **

- Velious racial plate helm quests have been added that will allow you to 'trade in' your existing helms for ones with 
textures. We have decided to allow the players (or their characters) to chose whether they wish to have the new helmet 
textures or to continue to use helmets that show no graphics.

- Five and ten charge versions of Potions of the Bone Field have been added.

- Kilva's Skin of Flame potion has been changed. It no longer has the same effect as the Kilva's Blistering Flesh 
potion.

- Removed the tinting from Dark Forge and Resonant armors. Tinting was never really intended to be on those pieces 
and, frankly, they look better without it.


** Miscellaneous Items **

- Reduced the 'bottleneck' for getting Howling Stone keys by increasing the availability of one of the quest items.

- Erudite guards will now be much less friendly to Kobolds.

- Vendors are once again selling the Coldain Tanner's Kit.


** 'Combine' container changes **

We've made a change to 'combine' containers. In order to prevent people from accidentally destroying items, all 
containers with a 'combine' button will not combine any items that do not form a complete recipe. This will be a huge 
boon to craftspeople all across Norrath. But this removes the only drawback to using trade containers as backpacks. 
Their reduced weight and often greater carrying capacity made them more desirable as bags, with the compensating risk 
that you might just lose something if you made a mistake.

We will be increasing the weight of portable 'combine' containers somewhat. Where some of these containers weighed 
under 1 pound, they will now weigh as much as 4 pounds for the largest sewing kit.

Along with this we are making a change to tailor made backpacks. In case you didn't know, most tailor made packs have 
a built in weight reduction of 5%. We are raising that to 10%. We will also be displaying the weight reduction of all 
containers with the information shown on a right click.

*Client Patch*

Tonight we patched out a new EverQuest client. This client will address issues reported by those using video cards that require square textures, and who are crashing or
experiencing garbled textures. 

We are working on the other problems reported. As always, please be sure you have installed DirectX 7 or higher, and have also installed the latest drivers for your video
card. It is very important that the video drivers are installed AFTER DirectX.

***Fan Faire Reminder***

Registration for the San Diego Fan Faire closes on Wednesday, March 28th, and we are running out of spaces. Once all the spaces are taken, we will not be accepting any
further registrations (or walk-ins). So if you plan to attend sign up before someone else gets your spot. Head over to www.everquest.com to register.


*** Patch Day ***

*Spell Changes and Additions*

- A new teleportation spell has been added to the game for both Druids and Wizards. These are self-only gate spells to the Dreadlands. These spells should be available on
the more exclusive spell vendors in Norrath.

- Increased the drop rate on some Kunark spells to coincide with the narrowing of the creatures carrying those spells as the game evolves.

- Wizards now have access to a new type of spell that only works on certain types of target. Generically called 'bane' spells, a few are now available in the game. May your
quest for such spells be successful.


*Item Changes*

- Changed the effects on the Singing Steel Boots and Greaves. After a fair amount of concern from players, we have removed the summon food and water effects from these
items. They have been replaced with modified versions of Aria of the Eagles (boots) and Appalling Screech (greaves).

- The Incandescent Bracer can now be worn on the wrist rather than the waist.

- The Incarnadine Breastplate must now be worn to activate.

- Changed spell effects on Pauldrons of the Fearsome and Fearsome Shield to right click and worn to activate.


*Bug Fixes*

- Fixed a bug that was causing some players to zone into the Warrens at the wrong location.

- Corrected an error with the Bixie Sword Blade, changing its delay from 6 to 16.

- Fixed a bug where Iskar Monks were unable to Feign Death after Foraging.

- Kodiaks in the Great Divide are now seen as animals.

- Toxdil, the wandering rogue poison vendor, will now sell to characters even when he is away from his home.


*Enhancements*

- Fixed a problem that occurred when players mistyped /guild. Typing /guildd in the chat window is the shortcut for typing /guilddelete. /guildd now has a confirmation box
so that such an error should no longer lead to the accidental deletion of a guild. 

- Added /showspelleffects. Using this toggle ('on' or 'off') a player can turn on or off the display of particle effects for spells. This will only affect spells, not world
effects like waterfalls or weapon particle effects. This should allow you to turn off many of the effects that hamper rendering performance, inducing effects of spells,
while still being able to see some of the awesome effects, like those on certain paladin weapons...

- Added server-side filtering for chat and combat messages. This will allow you to turn off guild chat, shouts, auctions, oocs, 'my misses', 'others misses', 'others hits',
'attacker misses me', PC spells (all options), NPC spells and Bard songs (all options) at the server instead of at the client. This can reduce that amount of data sent to
you over your connection, and can help those with slower connections with better performance and connectivity.

- Ships will now be announcing their arrival in most zones. They will also be announcing their progress to any zone they travel through. Any of those zones that they are not
currently making announcements in will be added in the next patch or two.

- Shift - Left and Shift - Right will now repeat in the chat window. This means that when editing what you've typed, you can just hold down the Shift and Left Arrow keys and
the cursor will move left until it reaches the beginning of the line or until you release the keys.

- The spell slot number will now show up in front of the spell name when you press Alt to cast a spell using the Alt-Spell Number method.

- View perspective in wolf form has been fixed. First-person view will now be on level with the wolf, rather than a few feet above it. At the same time, perceiving other
players in wolf form will appear to be standing on the ground instead of floating a few feet above it.

- Trade skill success and failure messages will be sent to the craftsperson's group instead of just the craftsperson, as long as the craftsperson is using the proper
ingredients. Failure of the craftsman to use the proper ingredients will result in no failure message being sent.

- In order to prevent a few trade scams, money can no longer be removed from a trade window. You will have to cancel the trade and start over to adjust the amount of money
involved in the trade.

- We're now sending hitpoint updates to the casters of direct damage spells no matter how far away they are when the spell lands. This will allow those casters that try to
stand as far back as possible to get updates even when their range indicates that the messages should be surpressed.

*Quest*

Several new quests have been added as well, so don't be afraid to talk to the folks of Norrath, they might have new information for you.
