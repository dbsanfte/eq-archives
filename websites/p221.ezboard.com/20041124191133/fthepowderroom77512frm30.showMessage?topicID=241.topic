<br>
the red tailed sharks, at least 2 of them, look like they have either white on them, or they are missing scales. they looked to have some tail and fin rot, but we quarentined them in the 10 gallon (which we did a complete tear down yesterday due to a huge snail infestation), for a bit, and treated them. just when we put them BACK into the big tank, (and tore the other down, OI.) the stuff came back. <br>
<br>
these sharks are hearty fish, they are about 4-5 inches long each. pretty lil bastards when healthy, they are black, with red fins and tails. but the white is not so pretty. i THINK it might be ich, but the melafix SHOULD have fixed it, and we treated them for the specified time. all we can do now is set up the 10 gallon again, run it again for a week, do what we need to do to get the bio cycle running again, and retreat the fish. i just don't know that i want to treat 5 red tailed sharks, and 5 marble botia (about 3 inches now probably) and potentially the pictus, as well as the silver tipped sharks we have, all in the 10 gallon at once. (these are pretty good sized fishes. the silver tipped, 4 are still small, but 1 is bigger than the red tailed sharks by a little bit, so he's maybe 5 inches, possibly 6 now?) basically, super crowded.<br>
<br>
anyone know fish stuff? i just don't know if it'll be an issue of reinfection if this is what they have. i could PROBABLY do the botia and the redtailed sharks together, for the 5 day treatment, and they'd be ok. <br>

I would try that. Follow the instructions to the letter also, you can actually filter out the benefits of the medication if you leave your filter running with charcoal in it. Also you , if you don't mind, can do a direct to scale treatment with most of the items on the market. Look at some information on other bacterias, there are treatment that kill many of those &quot;bugs&quot; at once. JUST remember if you do treat for bacteria types you will most likely kill off some of the built up environment in your tank also. Sick fish are a pain, so many &quot;things&quot; of what ails them looks alike. <br>
<br>
And get a book on common fish diseases.  There are a lot of preventative measures that you can do to reduce this risk.<br>

<br>
Anyways, was going to ask if there is a reason you can't just treat the main tank (other than the cost of enough ich meds to treat that much)?<br>
<br>
It does sound like ich and from my experience... firstly, I would bet money that (assuming it IS ich) every fish in the tank is infected even if they aren't showing symptoms. So if you just pull out the symptom showing ones (forgot the term for that) and treat them... they'll get reinfected from the other fish as soon as you put them back.<br>
<br>
Secondly, I'd also bet money that it's IN the tank too -- so even pulling out all the fish and treating them might not be effective, if they aren't out long enough for the ich spore thingies (forgot what they're called too) to die from lack of hosts... think that takes a good couple weeks tho.<br>
<br>
My reccomendation... pull out any invertebrates (snails etc), and any really delicate species of plants (they can live in your hospital tank for a month, more than enough time for the ich spore things to die)... take the charcoal out of the filter and take out your bio filter too if you can. If it's a biowheel, take the whole filter out, put it on the hospital tank (to keep the biowheel &quot;alive&quot;). If you have one that uses those little balls, take out several handfuls of them and keep them moist yet aerated (sp?) to hopefully save as much of the good bacteria as you can. Then turn up the heat on the tank, just a little... maybe 5 degrees or so (depending on how warm it usually gets and how warm the species you keep can tolerate, I never kept many of those species myself so I don't know thier specifics) because warmer water will make the ichs lifecycle go faster (meaning treatment will work better, because most ich meds don't affect them when they're on the fish or in &quot;spore&quot; stage, only when they're in thier free swimming stage looking for a host).<br>
<br>
Once thats done, treat the whole tank. I personally always preferred RidIch+ for ich infestations... it's also pretty decent as a first line of defense for new fish. I routinely treated my quarantine tank, then kept em quarantined for another 14 days or so (so total, about 3 weeks) before I introduced new fish... kept outbreaks of stuff to a minimum. And I also used it for a couple other ich-like diseases (velvet, fin rot, etc) -- it's not specific for them, but if it's just a mild case it'll usually help clear it up.<br>
<br>
As to other things it could be, other than Ich... could be fin rot, or velvet, or the fish could be fighting amongst themselves (I thought redfin sharks were aggressive with each other, but that could have been red tail sharks... or vice versa, forgot which species you have) and getting infections.<br>
<br>
also, could be caused by poor water quality. If you can, get a test kit (the master kit with the dropper bottles preferably, the dip strip types are inaccurate in my experience... forget the name of the company, maybe aquarium pharmecuticals? but the logo is an orange fish in a medical lab coat thing). If you can't afford or can't find a test kit, take a water sample to your local fish store (petsmart usually will test water free, but my last experience with them in that regard was probably 4 years ago now) and ask them if they can test the ammonia, nitrates, ph, etc etc. If none of those are an option... I would just assume thats part of the problem, start a course of 30% water changes every 3 days with treated water (chlorine killer basically, or aged water... don't use bottled water except in emergencies, it's missing alot of things that aquariums need, like trace elements) and change the filter asap.<br>
<br>
Don't know how experienced a fish person you are, so I'm just giving all the advice I can think of... so please don't get offended if some of the stuff above strikes you as being really &quot;well DUH&quot; material lol. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://hostmysig.com/data/ladyneeva/82545.php"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END-->Hamsters are Furry<br>

<br>
we have excellant water in that tank. we have a reverse osmosis water treatment that we use for water changes, water tests excellant all over the board. i don't know if there's snails in there, we haven't seen any in the big tank. we do have the bioball filter, which in itself is a hassle, as that puppy has a LOT of balls. (we're talking probably 3 5-gallon buckets full at least.) the plants are fairly well rooted, NOW (after much hassle with the burrowing loaches digging them up and making them float to the top), so taking them out would make me very sad. <br>
<br>
i did think of putting in the heater, whereever it may be, and turning up the temp. of the water. if i do that, could it potentially kill the plants? <br>
<br>
red tailed sharks, that be what we have. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.mywhimsy.com/boards/dvicons/emcheerful.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  sometime i'll get links to pics of our fish, since it's been a pain in the neck to get the camera to work right when i can actually get a good pic of the fishes. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.mywhimsy.com/boards/dvicons/emcheerful.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
a total aside, we have 5 silver tipped sharks. one sits in the west corner of the tank, but i can't figure out why. can't be lighting, cuz we have places he could swim under to hide from the light. we have plants, so it's not horribly bright to begin with. we had him first, and only him, as they were supposed to school with other types of fish. we've since added 4, making it the 5 total. how the heck do i encourage him to leave the corner? i've put in a rock we found while camping on a freshwater lake (and boiled it first), so i'm hoping this helps him, but any other suggestions? (the rock has a ledge that he could hide under.) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#9AB3CA><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://p221.ezboard.com/bthepowderroom77512.showUserPublicProfile?gid=calimage>CaliMage</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://telusplanet.net/public/jabba1/CaliTrouble.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span class=glowtitle> Lil' Miss Trouble</span><br>

Does your tank have a thermometer in it?  Does the water temperature normally stay at the same level, a varient of a few degrees either way is not of concern. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><br>

This is why I prefer to go by scientific name if at all possible... because for example... take the species <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Balantiocheilus melanopterus</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> -- some people call it a &quot;tri color shark&quot;, sometimes it's also called a &quot;bala shark&quot;, while others call it a &quot;tinfoil shark&quot;, others call it a &quot;black tip shark&quot; and still others call it a &quot;silver shark&quot;... heh.<br>

Since the plants can't be removed... &lt;ponder&gt; are they hardy plants? Like amazon swords and anachris? Those can prolly take a treatment of ich meds... on the other hand, if they're like cambomba or something delicate like that, they probably can't.<br>

If they can't... probably the best you can do is to get more &quot;hospital tanks&quot;... something I've done a time or two was to get some sort of a tub or something that can hold water... a large bucket perhaps... scrub it real good and use it for a temporary treatment facility. Anything water-tight will work... heck, ask my family -- at one point I had fish living in the spare bathtub LOL. And a couple times I found myself having to transport a fish that was too big for any conventional transport methods (bags for example) or otherwise unsuitable for them (due to spines)... so I transported them in a cardboard box lined with garbage bags. Or, on one never (I hope) to be repeated occasion... transporting an almost 11 inch long plecostomus in a cassarole dish LOL. Poor Moo had to curl around almost in a ball to fit... but we got the old boy moved in one piece. But he was NOT happy, and we were afraid he'd thrash himself right out of the dish during the time it took to get the tank set back up (it was an emergency situation and all MY tanks were way way WAY too small to temporarily house ANY of dad's fish... I only had 2 set up at that time, both under 2 gallons..) so... we put him in the sink LOL.<br>
<br>
Ok, got off on a tangent there. Umm... dunno how &quot;tight&quot; money is... would it be reasonable for you to afford some of that black pond liner stuff, and cut it into pieces big enough to completely enclose a heavy cardboard box or plywood box of some sort that would be big enough to treat everyone in? Or possibly go to K-Mart or WalMart or something and buy some big plastic storage bins? You could siphon the water from the main tank to fill them mostly, and do a large scale water change on the main tank at the same time maybe. Would be awkward as heck emptying them later tho.<br>
<br>
Oh, as to snails... just noticed you have botia species in there, so no you most likely have no snails. At least, not anymore... botias tend to enjoy eating snails hehe. So do large gouramis... learned that the hard way! Those big ones (<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Trichogaster trichopterus trichopterus</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>T. leeri</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>T. microlepis</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> mostly) REALLY love snails... course, they're fascinating in and of themselves, and they breed like rabbits LOL. Oh, most common common names I know for them are Three Spot Gourami (often also called blue gouramis, crosby gouramis, or gold gouramis depending on color), Pearl Gourami (occasionally robin gourami or red breasted gourami), and Moonlight Gourami.<br>
<br>
As to the red (finned or tailed) sharks...<br>
<br>
Red Tail Shark is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Epalzeorhynchus bicolor</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and heres a <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.webcityof.com/ffpw3.asp?IID=181" target="top">picture</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->... these ones are listed as solitary and extremely territorial on 99% of the things I've ever read.<br>
<br>
Red Fin Shark is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Epalzeorhynchus frenatus</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and heres a <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.aquariacentral.com/species/db2.cgi?db=fresh&amp;uid=default&amp;ID=0596&amp;picture3_page_view=1" target="top">picture</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> of this species... these are also often called &quot;Rainbow Sharks&quot; and &quot;Red-finned Sharks&quot; and sometimes &quot;Red fin black sharks&quot;. They're also usually referred to as territorial amongst themselves and other similiar species, but I've seen them kept in schools occasionally especcially while young. There is an albino form of this species that is VERY attractive I think... instead of black and red, it's white and red 8)<br>
<br>
A pretty good reference site is <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.aquariacentral.com/" target="top">Aquaria Central</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> -- they usually have accurate information and good pictures.<br>
<br>
&lt;sigh&gt; Now I want an aquarium... hopefully with luck I'll be moving back to colorado soon, where even with minimum wage jobs we'll be able to afford an apartment and I'll have room to set up an aquarium again! Oh Rapture! <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://hostmysig.com/data/ladyneeva/82545.php"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END-->Hamsters are Furry<br>

we're gonna head to the petco tomorrow and pick up a couple bottles of melafix, as that's helped before. we DO have amazon swords, we have 2 of those actually. (they've grown to be very gorgeous.) i'm thinking we might tweak up the temp just a hair or so.<br>

<br>
Ok, my guess is, if it is NOT ich, that they're all fighting amongst themselves for territory, since red-fin sharks and silver tip sharks are both listed as being very territorial -- I don't know though, maybe 150 gallons (that was what your tank was right?) is enough for them to establish territories...<br>
<br>
if it's not, and they ARE fighting... sorry to say but the only way to prevent the fungus etc from re-appearing every single time would be to break em up and only keep one of each species 8(<br>
<br>
Good news is, clown loaches ARE a schooling fish... most people keep them singly, which is bad for them because they really prefer to be in at least a group of 5.<br>
<br>
Also, I saw one note on a page while looking for info for my previous post that said silvertip sharks are a semi-brackish water species when they get older, but that they can be kept in fresh water... sorta like how mollies like having a little salt in thier water but get by just fine without it. &lt;shrug&gt; I wouldn't worry about that tho hehe.<br>
<br>
If it is possible, or becomes neccessary, maybe you could get other aquariums and split up your &quot;problem children&quot;... like, one of each species to a tank? &lt;shrug&gt; No idea if thats possible tho 8(<br>
<br>
There are alot of attractive species of loaches and sharks tho, that even tho they're solitary species would be ok mixed together.<br>
<br>
So basically, knowing what you have... I'd guess that while it might be Ich, it's more likely to be fighting amongst themselves and getting &quot;infections&quot; basically.

we weren't sure if we were gonna turn a tank to a brackish tank or not. i would love to, and then get other brackish fish, since easier than a tropical tank, but right now all we have other than the big tank, is the 10 gallon, and that's gonna be a lil small for 5 silver tipped sharks. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8o --><img src=http://www.mywhimsy.com/boards/dvicons/embigeyes.gif ALT="8o"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#B4C8DA><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://p221.ezboard.com/bthepowderroom77512.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kulaniautumnwood>Kulani Autumnwood</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_purplespot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Give me a custom<br>title already!</span><br>  Posts: 131<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/31/04 1:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p221.ezboard.com/fthepowderroom77512frm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=241.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Fishes</span><hr size=1> Ah, didn't know that the red fins do the same thing my beloved tiger barbs do. It makes sense tho, since they're both in the same general &quot;classification&quot; of fish heh.<br>
<br>
The problem with aquariums (according to my beloved spouse) is that they're too similiar to potato chips.<br>
<br>
Can't have just one. &lt;groan&gt; Yeah yeah, he likes making lame jokes that have been done a zillion times.<br>
<br>
I think at the height of my fish keeping days (since right now there wouldn't be room for even a betta much less a real aquarium) I had 15 or 20 ten gallons either containing assorted &quot;small community&quot; fish, breeding tanks for smaller species, or single species tanks that weren't intended for breeding but more for show. Then I had my 6 thirty gallon tanks, which were either medium-large species communities or contained a single breeding pair of the trigocaster gouramis. And then there was my beloved 55 gallon tank containing... <br>
<br>
drumroll please...<br>
<br>
Six Feeder Goldfish and One Plecostomus!<br>
<br>
LOL<br>
<br>
These were special feeder goldfish tho... I mentioned (in passing) to my husband (then fiancee) that I always felt sorry for the feeder goldfish... either they get bought just to be tossed all alone in a small area with a large predator and no hiding places, or they get stuffed into a jar barely big enough to turn around in, with no plants, no filter, no airation, no nothing.<br>
<br>
Next day I came home to a 10 gallon aquarium and 6 little bitty feeder goldfish lol.<br>
<br>
Which quickly became larger feeder goldfish, and were moved to a 30 gallon tank...<br>
<br>
and quickly became even LARGER feeder goldfish... lol... so we bought the 55 and moved em there, where they remained until they were heartlessly MURDERED by my idiotic brother in law who apparently couldn't read the BRIGHT RED text printed on the box containing thier travel tanks during a late December move in Colorado... text that read &quot;LIVE FISH DO NOT LEAVE ON PORCH OR THEY WILL DIE!!!! THIS MEANS YOU!!!! PUT THIS BOX INSIDE DOOR AND PLUG IN CORD HANGING FROM RIGHT CORNER!!!!!!&quot; with a red arrow pointing to where the aerator cord was sticking out.<br>
<br>
Needless to say the idiot left em on the porch and they all died 8( My husband was most unhappy and spent the next month apologizing for not carrying the box himself. Predictably enough idiot brother in law said &quot;was just a bunch of stupid fish.&quot; (yes, my sister has since divorced the jagoff lol)<br>
<br>
Those were the only fish I've ever had that earned names... Comet was the big gold comet tail, Poncho was the white with a red spot on his head, Clown was the white with a red spot on his nose and overlarge red pectoral fins, Ghost was the solid white, Silver was a funny silver/grey/bronze color that all goldfish start as and most outgrow by the time they're a year old, but he never did. Lefty was an orange with one pectoral fin (gee, guess which one) that was white.<br>
<br>
They were good fish 8( My husband even liked them (and he's honestly indifferent to fish)... but he thought it was funny how every time he walked past the tank they would come &quot;beg&quot; for treats... eventually I started keeping a little dish of fish treats on the top so Bri could give in... carefully rationed so that there was no way bri could overdo his generosity and foul the tank (was 6 extra large freeze dried krill per day lol)<br>
