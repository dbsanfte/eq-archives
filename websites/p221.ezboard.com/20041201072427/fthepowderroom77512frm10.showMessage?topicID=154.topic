<br>
 I need to rant about work! I'm entirely too sick of my job at the moment..so here we go...<br>
<br>
What's your Top 10 list of hate at your workplace? Here's mine:<br>
<br>
A drive thru bank teller's top ten list:<br>
<br>
10. Please respond to me when I talk to you, I am not an ATM machine, I am flesh and blood and deserve atleast an acknowledgment. Smile, nod, hello, SOMETHING! I hate it when I feel like I am talking to myself!<br>
<br>
9. Don't stuff a wad of cash in my drive up tubes. Crumbled up bills are a pain in the rear, and take longer to count and verify to boot. And they don't like to lay flat in my drawer. One day I'm going to take the cash you're getting back and crumble it into a little wad, and watch you try to stick it in your wallet. And laugh madly when you can't.<br>
<br>
8. I am not responsible for balancing your checkbook. If you have an account, you really should be smart enough to reconcile it yourself. Or, if you can't reconcile it, atleast be able to write your own transactions in your register. I am busy, I don't have time to hold your hand and write everything down for you, I really don't. If you can't do small things for yourself, why in blazes do you even HAVE a checking account? <br>
<br>
7. I'm not stupid. I can distinguish between two transactions. if you have more than one, send all your junk in, and tell me what you need. I'm intelligent enough that if I don't know, I'll ask questions. It's better than playing volleyball with the drive up tube. It annoys the people behind you to no end, then they're grouchy and won't talk to me, because they assume it's my fault!<br>
<br>
6. Your account balance does NOT matter. I don't care if you have 100 grand in your account, I'm not breaking the rules for you. I'm not going to treat you any better than the fool who has 10 bucks in his account. Deal with it...us poor folk do.<br>
<br>
5. Please, please, PLEASE, have your junk ready by the time you get up to my window. I hate &quot;Lane Cloggers&quot;, people who take forever to sign their checks and send em in. Oh, and the math geniuses, who take 20 mins to fill out their deposit slips, and are still wrong. Buy a calculator. <br>
<br>
4. No, I cannot cash a check through drive thru unless you are an account holder. No, I cannot count your 50lbs bag full of change thru drive thru. No, I can't take 10 minutes to make you 30 money orders in drive thru. Get your LAZY ass out of your car and come inside! Use your BRAIN! If you have a Jack Daniels bottle full of change, do you really think it's even going to fit in my drive thru drawer??<br>
<br>
3. Know how much money you're depositing. I wouldn't hand my money over to someone without knowing exactly how much I have! When I ask...how much cash do you have here? I am not stupid, really. I am simply verfiying how much moolah you just handed over to me. Next time I won't ask. And don't ask me where that $20 went...I have no idea.<br>
<br>
2. Yes, our drive up lanes are very narrow. But really, I DIDN'T build the bank. It's not my fault you hit the building because you can't seem to figure out how to drive in the lanes. Don't bitch at me because you feel like an idiot. Drive slowly and cautiously, and you'll make it, I promise. Tons of people do the same every day here, and they make it ok, you can too.<br>
<br>
1. Ok, I know the ATM is a mysterious thing. Yes, I do the upkeep on our ATM. But for crying out loud, don't come stand over me and ask me questions about the ATM when I have it wide open. It makes me suspisious of you.  Oh, and while I'm at it, don't think that coming up behind a bank employee and saying &quot;Give me all your money&quot; is funny. Because it really isn't. Next time, I'll just call the cops and you can tell THEM how funny you think you are. I guarentee they won't be any more amused than I am!<br>
<br>
Ok I feel a bit better now <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.mywhimsy.com/boards/dvicons/smlyWink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
1-If there are signs saying the car wash is not operating, you buy one anyhow, and then berate me for not having signs...  I have zero sympathy for you.  None, nada, zilch.  Pay attention people.<br>
<br>
2- I may be required to say hello/hi/whassup when you enter the door, but it doesn't mean I'm an automaton.  Please respond with a nod, a wink, a hi, a squeak even.  Acknowledge my presence please.<br>
<br>
3- Put the money/credit card IN MY HAND.  It takes me longer to scrape it off the counter than for you to put it in the palm of my hand.  If I need to count it, I can then place it on the counter in front of us so we can verify the amount of money you've just handed to me.<br>
<br>
4- Don't park in front of the building in a no-parking zone.  We have parking spots, use them.  Don't park in front of the pump that someone may want to actually get fuel at.  Thank you<br>
<br>
5- Speak up!  I can't hear you over the cooler running, the soda fountain maching making noise etc, when you are speaking every so softly<br>
<br>
6- Please just have your id ready.  If you want cigarettes or beer, know the drill unless you have white hair.  I am the id Queen and I will not sell these things to you unless you have them, I would like to keep my job.  If I sell to a minor and get caught once, I have zero income.  Thank you<br>
<br>
7- If you write on the back of your credit/debit card that you would like me to see your id, expect me to check it.  Yes, I WILL make you go out to your car and get it because you ASKED ME to verify that it is really truly you using that card.<br>
<br>
8- Please partially fill out your check before coming inside.  Please have your driver's license availabe even if you've been to my store 50 million times.  I may have never seen you before.  Bring it in even if your driver's license # is on the check, I need to make sure it isn't stolen/forged.  (yes this has happened at my station)<br>
<br>
9-  Don't stand there and scratch lottery tickets for half an hour.  I have lots of other stuff to do.  Cleaning the bathrooms, stocking cups/lids/condiments, sweeping, mopping, cleaning doors/windows, stocking cigarettes, making sure we have windshield washer fluid/paper towels outside, changing trash cans and lots of other stuff to ensure you have a nice place to stop for whatever it is.  So please buy your tickets and go scratch them in your car or something.<br>
<br>
10-  Don't grab the pot that I am brewing coffee in.  There is a stream of coffee going into that pot, this is going to go all over the burner, the counter, the floor, your feet and my nerves.  Look at what you're doing, please.<br>
<br>
<br>
These are not in any particular order, I don't expect you to follow these... Just suggestions for a happier clerk the next time you stop in ;p<br>
<br>
And pardon my bitter sarcastic tone, I just have a really really dry sense of humor.  I think I feel better now I've gotten all that out.  Thanks! <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.kc.rr.com/sulianne/signature.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

<br>
and i worked at a gas station. i so feel your pain. i'd add 2-<br>
<br>
&quot;it's 10 pm. no, you cannot buy a lottery ticket. you can wait until 6 am for your little fix, because i'm not selling it to you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;we stop selling beer at 2am. you know what that means? it means at 6 am, we'll start selling again. don't worry. you smell so much of booze, that you could probably wait a week before you sober up. 6 am is only 2 hours off.&quot;<br>
<br>
and currently, i work at a &quot;coffee company&quot;. /cough. by FAR the customers are the worst, sometimes.<br>
<br>
1- no, i did not hear your order. you might know what you want, and you might want it quickly, but just because you can rattle it off that fast, doesn't mean i can ring it and write it that fast.<br>
<br>
2- i do not need your change. my drawer has quite enough pennies in it, thanks. oh, you have a few nickles for me? there's this place, called the bank, that sometimes, if you are nice, will give you paper money for all that. if you don't have time to do that, what DO you have time for?<br>
<br>
3- no, i do not like layering your drink. thanks for persuading the 15 other blended coffee beverage drinkers in front of you that it tasted so good, that i should do that for them too.<br>
<br>
4- DO NOT HOVER. i know how to make this drink. if i have any questions, about how you might want it, i think i know how to work my mouth to ask. <br>
<br>
5- i will do anything i can to make this a really good experience for you, even though you are making this a MISERABLE experience for *ME*. i am being as patient as i can, while you make up your mind. maybe you could go back to the end of the LONG LINE and by the time you get to me again, you'll know what you want. <br>
<br>
6- yes, you DID ask for a mocha. oh, you wanted the mocha BLENDED COFFEE BEVERAGE. that is not what you asked for. remember when i repeated back to you what you had ordered? then would have been a good time to tell me you had not made yourself clear.<br>
<br>
7- it is not my fault we are out of citrus. i do not do the ordering. in fact, i haven't been here for a week. do not expect me to drop what i am doing, and go to the warehouse, or whereever you are expecting me to go, and get it. i cannot control everything.<br>
<br>
8- do you do this in your own house?? why are there shreds of toilet paper all over the bathroom?? did you need to use ALL the soap?? if you would not leave your own bathroom like this, why would you leave ours like that??<br>
<br>
9- i am not amused that you order water. it takes time, and when there is a long line behind you, of paying customers, it really irritates not only me, but probably several people behind you.<br>
<br>
10- stop being so cheap. if you want more coffee, pay the extra 10 or whatever cents it is for the bigger cup, and be alright with me putting less in it.<br>
<br>
<br>
that does feel a lot better. there are days where all of this applies, and some days, when none of it happens. (oh so very rare.)  <p><center><a href="http://pub50.ezboard.com/bgardenofearthlydelights"><img src="http://www.dslextreme.com/users/everlost/images/Delights/xantalost.jpg" border=0></a><BR><a href="http://pub238.ezboard.com/bthepowderroom77512"><img src="http://www.dslextreme.com/users/everlost/images/Delights/PRblinkfaeflyble.gif"border=0></a></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#B4C8DA><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub238.ezboard.com/bthepowderroom77512.showUserPublicProfile?gid=siklebellamorte>Sikle Bellamorte</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span class=glowtitle>Mr. Obvious </span><br><a href=http://www.imood.com/query.cgi?email=tebyen@hotmail.com><img src=http://moods.imood.com/display/email=tebyen@hotmail.com/trans=1 alt=The current mood of tebyen@hotmail.com at www.imood.com border=0></a></span><br>  Posts: 573<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/13/03 8:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p221.ezboard.com/fthepowderroom77512frm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=154.topic&index=3>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.cold-comfort.com/monkey.gif height=60 width=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.mywhimsy.com/boards/dvicons/smlywha2.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Top 10 list</span><hr size=1> Ohhhh, work rants, I love these. I might not have worked in a year, but oh do I remember the things that would annoy me to no end. <br>
<br>
1. Look for something before you ask me where it is. I don't mean walk around the edge of the store, glancing down the isles either. I have a lot to do, and taking time to show you where something is, usually in a huge display of said item at that, won't get my job done any faster. <br>
<br>
2. If you don't see it on the shelf, chances are we don't have any. If you ask if we have any in back and we say no, believe us. We know what's in the stock room, we spend 75% of our work day back there. <br>
<br>
3. Don't come up to the register with a buggy full of stuff and pay with nothing but loose change. If you have the time to stand here, wasting my time and the customer's time behind you as well, to count out change like that, then roll it at home and then come shopping. <br>
<br>
4. If you see us unloading a truck, don't stop us to ask us where the toilet paper is, or the bleach, or any of the thousands of other items we sell. We don't have the time to show you, and again, it's usually in a huge display of what you're looking for. <br>
<br>
5. If  you see us unloading a truck, don't ask us if we can climb into said truck, find a case of the product you want, and get you 1 of that product. We're not allowed on that truck by contract, by state law, and by company policy. <br>
<br>
6. Don't go in the stockroom. Ever. There's no bathroom back there, no merchandise that isn't already on the floor, no cash register to check you out, or any other thing back there you can possibly need. It's not all that safe for employees back there, much less customers who aren't aware of our stacking styles, spills, and cleaning chemicals. <br>
<br>
7. Don't come into our store and ask us to sell you our store fixtures. We don't sell them. We're not that kind of store. And we especially won't sell them to you lower than what we paid for them. <br>
<br>
8. Don't bring in our competiter's merchandise and expect us to exchange it, or give you a refund. It's not like it's hard to tell the difference. Our sign is yellow and black, their's is white and red. Our bags are yellow and black, their's is white and red. Our prices are in quarter increments. Their's is weird like 2.95 instead of an even $3. Their receipts are twice the width of ours. <br>
<br>
9. Dont' come in to shop smelling of alcohol, feces, or anything else that is offensive. We dont' like the odor, and we will refuse you service. <br>
<br>
10. If you spill, break, or otherwise damage merchandise accidently, dont' leave it there for others to get hurt on. Find us, we don't charge for accidental stuff like that. <br>
<br>
11. Don't spit tobacco juice on our floors. It's damn hard to clean up when it dries, it stinks, and it leaves a stain. Also, don't spit it on our clothes, that destroys the merchandise, costs us money, and raises our prices. <br>
<br>
12. If you see me standing there bandaging a wound, or my ankle, knee or wrist, don't come up to me and ask me to help you. I will snap at you, I will call you foul names, and I will make your life a living hell anytime you're in the store in the future.  <br>
<br>
13. If you pick something up, and decide you don't like, please put it back where it goes. Spending 3 hours a day just putting things back where they go isn't fun. Not to mention it can cause us to over order, or mess up an inventory if we're doing that. <br>
<br>
14. Keep your children with you. This isn't a daycare. We get fined if a customer is injured. We don't think your brat is cute if he/she/it is running around the store screaming at the top of her/his/it's lungs, and knocking stuff over. It gives us a headache, and more work to do, like we don't have enough. <br>
<br>
15. If you see me at the register with a long line of customers, don't stand there and chat with me after you've paid for your stuff. It just irritates the other customers, and can cause me to make a mistake. <br>
<br>
16. If I'm standing there, box cutter in one hand, apron with a name tag on it on me, and putting stock on a shelf, don't come up to me and ask if I work there. You will get a smart ass remark. <br>
<br>
17. If I'm up on a ladder changing signs, lightbulbs, air filters, or hanging stuff from the ceiling, don't come by and shake it. It scares the hell out of me, and I will cuss you out for it. Also, don't ask for my assistance while I'm up there, I don't trust ladders, and am quite nervous on one. I'll just ignore you til I get down.<br>
<br>
18. If you come up and the doors are locked, don't think we're gonna let you in. We're not. The hours are clearly posted on the door, you're not getting in a minute earlier, and you're not coming in a minute later either. <br>
<br>
19. Just because our doors are standing open, doesn't mean we're open. Especially when I'm putting the sidewalk merchandise out. I have to get this stuff out before I can let you in, and having to stop every 30 seconds to tell you no, not yet won't help me get done any faster. <br>
<br>
20. See that sign? Yes, that one that says no pets. It applies to everyone. It doesn't matter if it's a spider, hamster, dog, giraffe, or any other type of pet. We sell food, by law we cannot have animals in the store with the exception of seeing eye dogs, cats, ponies, pigs, or whatever else our blind customers use. (Yes, I have seen blind people use said animals before.)<br>
<br>
21. Do you go into your bathroom at home and leave unspeakable messes over everything? Nope, didnt' think so, don't do it here. We don't like cleaning up such messes, and we will lock the bathrooms if it becomes too bad. <br>
<br>
22. Don't use the blue buggies marked employees only. We use these to move merchandise from the stockroom to the floor when there's not enough enough to use a roller, but too much to carry. Besides which, they don't fit down our isles that well, and will make a mess if you're not really careful. <br>
<br>
23. Don't cuss us out if we run out of bread, milk, cheese, chips, snack cakes, or greeting cards that you like. We don't order those. We don't even touch those areas unless some dimwit has set something there that doesn't go, or set one of those products out of place. <br>
<br>
24. We do not sell tobacco, alcohol, or porn related products. We never have, and don't plan on ever selling such things. This includes lottery tickets. <br>
<br>
25. Don't steal from us. Especially not at our prices. If you can't afford 50 cents for a tooth brush, tell us, we'll give you one. Same for toilet paper. Theft costs us money, time and rises prices. <br>
<br>
26. If I'm sitting in my office, filling out forms, on the phone, counting the safe and whatnot, don't come knocking on the door. I won't let you in. I won't even acknowledge the fact that you're there. <br>
<br>
27. Don't cuss at me or my employees. I will cuss back, and I will ban you from the store, and have you arrested for tresspassing if you ever set foot in my store again. <br>
<br>
28. If I tell you I'm the store manager, believe me. I don't lie. Yes, I am young, yes I do look grungy, but that doesn't mean I'm not in charge. You'd look grungy too if you had everything from applesauce to rotting tuna spilled on you from a truck that wasn't properly packed. (Let me tell you, rotting tuna juice, apple sauce, dawn dish detergent and bleach in a mixture on your clothes isn't a good smell, much less look.)<br>
<br>
29. If you see me talking with an officer of the law, don't come up bothering me. Chances are I just had to report a robbery, or witnessed one, or something of the such. Trust me, this is more important than you not being able to see the 10 ft by 8ft by 5 ft stack of bleach sitting in the back for sell. <br>
<br>
30. Yes, we accept coupons. No we do not accept coupons that say only redeemable at said and said store, unless we are that store. Don't try to use it. <br>
<br>
31.  Don't berate me if you hear me telling another customer to buy the cheaper washing powders. You know what? There's no difference between that $6.50 box of tide that does 32 loads in your hand than in the $2 box of store brand that does 64 loads, other than the $2 is a better deal. I have news for you, their the same product, made by the same company, just one does not have the name on it. <br>
<br>
32. If I have this nice stack of merchandise set up on display, don't buy from the bottom. It's all the same, and you could end up with an injury if you move the wrong thing. <br>
<br>
33. You see that bag of dirt over there that says 40 lbs. on it? That isn't a lie, it does weight 40 lbs, and it is heavy considering how damn small it is. Dont' try to pick up 3 of them and then bitch at me because you hurt yourself, I'll just laugh and call you a fool. <br>
<br>
34.  Don't ask me in the dead of winter if I have any charcoal. If you don't see it out, I don't have any. I can't order it, and we're only sent a certain amount each summer, which sells out quickly. <br>
<br>
35. If you see a price tag on the item, or it's sitting with a bunch of it's brothers over a sticker, that's the price we charge. No you don't get a discount if you're an employee, or if you buy in bulk, or if it's the 3rd sunday in the month of June during a leap year and it's snowing purple snow and the sky is ruby red. No one gets a discount. <br>
<br>
36. Don't throw your garbage in our parking lot. That's just more time we have to spend cleaning up your mess and not stocking shelves. I have news for ya, parking lots don't magically clean themselves ya know. <br>
<br>
37. We only sell 2 types of oil. 10W 30 and 10W 40, store brand. We dont' sell other brands unless the company gets a special on it, and we can't order it, so don't ask us if we can. If we could, we would. <br>
<br>
38. Don't ask me where the batteries are. We have a 5 foot counter of nothing but batteries as soon as you walk in. There's even a 2 foot sign above it saying Get your batteries here. If you miss it, then you shouldn't be driving, or even out without something or someone to guide you. <br>
<br>
39. Yes, we know so and so store has something cheaper, or is having a sell, or is offering discounts for buying in bulk, or doing a double coupon day, or any other type of gimmick. Well guess what, we're not that store. If you want that type of deal, go there. It's rare when someone has something cheaper than us, so stop your bitching about not doing any type of gimmick. We do $40,000 a week in business, and considering the most expensive thing we sell costs $25, that's damn good business. <br>
<br>
40. The most important one, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>NO ONE IS FORCING YOU TO SHOP HERE. THAT MEANS IF YOU DON'T LIKE SOMETHING WE DO, TAKE YOUR ASS SOMEWHERE ELSE, DON'T BITCH AT US.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

My first list was aimed at the customers, now to aim at my bosses. <br>
<br>
1. Don't come into my store in your $500 suit, and tell me how my displays should be. Especially when the only store training you had was the model store, where the counters are on wheels, where there's 4000 sq. ft more room that what my store has, and you don't have to deal with customers. I run this store on a day to day basis, I know the room I have, and I know my customers, so I'm the best one to make the judgement on the stackouts. <br>
<br>
2. Don't schedule floor cleaning, wall painting, or any other type of maintance involving my store without checking with me first and making sure I have someone who can be there when it's supposed to happen. Nothing irks me more than pulling an open to close shift then finding out I have to stay til 1 in the morning while the floors get stripped. <br>
<br>
3. Don't tell me to have my crew at the store to unload the truck at 6 am and then have the truck come in late. That's time and money wasted while we stand around wondering where the truck is, too afraid to get involved with any of the countless other projects we have going on in case  the truck shows up. <br>
<br>
4. Just because you think 1 person can put out 100 cases of stock an hour because of what people have done in a model store doesn't make it so. Those people didn't have to work around customers, didn't have to worry about where to put the extra merchandise, and didn't have phsyical ailments that made them move slower. <br>
<br>
5. If you want to see a perfect store during an inspection, don't do suprise inspections. It's impossible to keep a store in that kind of shape when you only have 7 employees to stock, run register, manage the store, and deal with the 1000+ customers a day. <br>
<br>
6. Don't base what you send us as extras on the truck with what sells well in Texas. We're not those stores, we won't sell the same things the same way.<br>
<br>
7. Don't tell me I order to much of a certain item a week. Yea, I order over 200 bags of dog food a week. Guess what, I sell that much a week, and more if you'd let me order more than that. <br>
<br>
8. Don't bitch at me when stuff doesn't get done after you've called and told me to send everyone home but me and 1 cashier. I'm not superman, I can't do the job of 6 people. <br>
<br>
9. Don't hire an assistant manager for me if they dont' have any experience in this paticular store. Premote the people I suggest for the job instead. <br>
<br>
10. Do not go to some store who has a stockroom full of junk that's not selling and move it to my store. It didn't sell there, what in the name of god makes you think it'll sell in mine? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#B4C8DA><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub238.ezboard.com/bthepowderroom77512.showUserPublicProfile?gid=vycine>Vycine </A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>TPR Regular</span><br>  Posts: 27<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/13/03 11:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p221.ezboard.com/fthepowderroom77512frm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=154.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.mywhimsy.com/boards/dvicons/smlywha2.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Top 10 list</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :comfort --><img src=http://www.mywhimsy.com/boards/dvicons/smlycomfort.gif ALT=":comfort"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I thought I had a quite a few rants, but your list went on and on!!

Even though at the moment I'm not doing this... but I have, and if I have to I will again...<br>
<br>
10. Slamming down the phone without a word gets you put right back into queue... and depending on the survey, we'll prolly rotate the queue once an hour... this means you'll be called back in an hour.<br>
<br>
9. Making rude/obscene noises and or comments... depending on the persons mood, how long they've worked there, the number of people who've done that to them today, and how amusing it was this gets you one of three things... put back in queue (see above), marked for a callback in 10 minutes, or my personal favorite, marked for a callback in 30 seconds...<br>
<br>
8. Saying &quot;Take me off your list&quot;... it doesn't help... it accomplishes nothing... seeing as for 99.9% of the studies we don't HAVE a friggin list... we have a set of randomly generated numbers that are deleted at the end of the study. And for the ones where we DO have a list... taking you off of it is pointless also, since the list either comes from A) the voter registration lists (which is public information, anyone with $5 copying costs can get a copy of it) or B) from the company paying for the study.<br>
<br>
7. When I ask a question, answer it. And only it. Don't go into a 15 minute diatribe about the evils of abortion when I asked you &quot;If the electior for mayor was being held today and was between JoeBlow Democrate and JaneDoe Republican, who would you vote for?&quot;<br>
<br>
6. If I ask a question and don't give a list of answers, speak slowly and clearly... either A) there is a tape recorder recording it (in which case I did tell you that) or B) I am typing it in word for word by hand. Including obscenities.<br>
<br>
5. We don't sell our lists... if I ask for your name it's for one reason and one reason only... so that my supervisor can call you and say &quot;Hey Mr. Dork, did you take a survey yesterday? Was the interviewer polite?&quot;<br>
<br>
4. Related to above... giving your name as Fred Astaire, Micky Mouse, and/or William Clinton is not amusing...<br>
<br>
3. No matter HOW funny you think it is, giving me a hard time is not amusing. I've probably heard your &quot;joke&quot; 30 times already that day alone. There really is a limit to the number of times &quot;I'll take your survey if you blow me&quot; is funny.<br>
<br>
2. Telling me to get a &quot;real job&quot; also isn't amusing... and if you've got the attention span of a turnip, you'd realize the job market SUCKS and we take what we can get.<br>
<br>
1. Last but not least... I am well aware of how stupid the questions are... I did not write them... I can't explain them... half the time I don't even understand them. Just answer the damn things... don't critique them. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://hostmysig.com/data/ladyneeva/82545.php"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END-->Hamsters are Furry<br>

I am very very shy.  Sometimes it is physically painful for me to talk to strangers.  Often I feel harassed by store employees who scream &quot;HI!&quot; at me when I walk in.  It's not always about you, sometimes the person has a huge shyness; they're not always intentionally being rude.<br>

Actually, in my state (Iowa), you would be required to put me on your Do Not Solicit list if I ask you to, that's state law.  And if I ask you to send me something in writing that you have done so, you're required to do that too.  I used to work for a telemarketer too.<br>

I'd post my Top 10 but I already did on another thread heh.  I'll share some of my favorite conversations with my customers, though...<br>

&quot;Hello?&quot;<br>
Ten minutes later the person gives me a policy number that is not one of ours.<br>
&quot;I'm sorry, I can't pull that number up.  What's your social security number?&quot;<br>
&quot;I don't give that out on the phone.&quot;<br>
&quot;I'm sorry sir, I'm unable to pull your policy up at this time.  I can search by your social security number or you can try to find a valid policy number and give us a call back.&quot;<br>
Obscenities ensue...<br>
&quot;Let me speak to your &amp;#@*&amp;%# supervisor.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you for calling Customer Service, my name is Victoria and I'm speaking on a recorded line, may I have the policy number please?&quot;<br>
&quot;Yeah I got a loan on my policy two days ago and I don't have it yet.&quot;<br>
&quot;May I have the policy number please?&quot;<br>
&quot;My name's Annie Smith and I got a loan two days ago.&quot;<br>
&quot;Hello, Annie.  Do you have the policy number?&quot;<br>
Finally I get the number...<br>
&quot;OK I see that we did submit your request two days ago, it typically takes 7-10 business days to process, so it will be mailed out next week for you.&quot;<br>
Obscenities ensue<br>
&quot;So you're mailing it out next week when will I get it?&quot;<br>
&quot;I'm sorry, I do not know how long it takes for the post office to deliver the mail from us to you.&quot;<br>
More obscenities...<br>
<br>
Bah forget it, I'm depressing myself.<br>

Ah, but note the word SOLICIT there... we're not selling ANYTHING, and are not classed as solicitors... therefore, we do not need to take you off our list.<br>
<br>
Even if we had one, which like I said, 99% of the time we don't lol... it's all just a random set of numbers fed into a computer.<br>
<br>
(edit - added the below)<br>
<br>
The difference here is between telemarketers and telephone interviewers... the DNC lists, national or otherwise, are all for telemarketers. By definition, telemarketers are SELLING something... or setting an appointment to SELL something or something of that nature.<br>
<br>
All the telephone interviewers want is to ask you a few questions that are either about something you already own, a business you already use, or political stuff.<br>
<br>
Heres a good way to get off the phone quickly...<br>
<br>
If the interviewer asks &quot;Do you work in X, Y, or Z industries?&quot; tell them yes... 99.9% of the time, that's a &quot;screening&quot; question... and the survey will terminate.<br>
<br>
If they ask in the beginning of the interview for your income... give them the lowest income. 99% of the time that'll terminate the interview (because we don't want to ask people who make 10k a year about services for people who make 100k a year, they wouldn't have a frame of reference)<br>
<br>
If they ask you &quot;do you own such and such&quot; say no.<br>
<br>
If they ask &quot;do you think you will probably vote in the upcoming election for X&quot; say no.<br>
<br>
If they ask if you work in market research, say yes... almost ALL surveys will be terminated by that (not all tho -- political surveys don't do that, and some product surveys don't)<br>
<br>
Alternately of course, you could take the survey... honest, it's not usually very painful. And while there almost always are some &quot;sensitive&quot; questions (income etc) don't get mad at the interviewer for asking them, and then trying to get you to answer them... we tend to lose our jobs if we don't.<br>
<br>
As an aside, the reason most surveys are longer than 5 minutes is a simple one... people don't take surveys. So rather than make a short survey, fight to get 100 answers, and then next week another short survey for another 100 answers, they just put all the questions on one survey. By taking surveys, you make it easier to get answers. If it's easier tog et the answers, they make more shorter surveys... which means that there would be more work in the industry, which means more jobs and a better economy <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.mywhimsy.com/boards/dvicons/emcheerful.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
OTOH, telemarketers deserve to be shot. On sight.<br>
<br>
(I don't like people harassing me to buy stuff... I do like people asking me what flavor of toothpaste I prefer)<br>
<br>
Oh another thing... companies actually DO use this info. So whenever a major chain you like, discontinues something you like, you have to wonder... how many times was it because the 500 people they asked &quot;should we remove the mcrib sandwich&quot; were 90 year old house bound people who didn't even know what a mcrib was much less if they liked them or not? <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://hostmysig.com/data/ladyneeva/82545.php"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END-->Hamsters are Furry<br>

<br>
I can't really complain about my job, though, at the moment.  I do what I want, when I want, how I want.  Noone tells me what to do, how to do it, when to do it,  or what to say.  Plus, I get up to 14 weeks per year off and can take the time with little or no notice.   Are there any little things that piss me off, sure, but I really can't bitch too hard.<br>
<br>
Is it glamorous or does it pay an exhorbitant amount of cash?  No, but it's hard to find another job with this much freedom.<br>
<br>
BACK TO THE RETAIL HELL RANTS!   (Yes, I used to work retail AND service, so I really do sympathize.  People suck.)  <p>Kyrok<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->-Bring to life everything that you fear, live in the dark and the world is threatening.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#B4C8DA><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub238.ezboard.com/bthepowderroom77512.showUserPublicProfile?gid=vycine>Vycine </A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>TPR Regular</span><br>  Posts: 34<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/13/03 10:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p221.ezboard.com/fthepowderroom77512frm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=154.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.mywhimsy.com/boards/dvicons/smlywha2.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Top 10 list</span><hr size=1> Can I have your job?
