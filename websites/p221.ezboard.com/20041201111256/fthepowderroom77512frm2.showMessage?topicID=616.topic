According to today's regulators and bureaucrats, those of us who were kids in the 40's, 50's, 60's, or even maybe the early 70's probably shouldn't have survived.<br>
<br>
Our baby cribs were covered with bright colored lead-based paint. We had no childproof lids on medicine bottles, doors or cabinets, and when we rode our bikes, we had no helmets. (Not to mention the risks we took hitchhiking.)<br>
<br>
As children, we would ride in cars with no seat belts or air bags. Riding in the back of a pickup truck on a warm day was always a special treat.<br>
<br>
We drank water from the garden hose and not from a bottle. Horrors! We ate cupcakes, bread and butter, and drank soda pop with sugar in it, but we were never overweight because we were always outside playing. We shared one soft drink with four friends, from one bottle, and no one actually died from this.<br>
<br>
We would spend hours building our go-carts out of scraps and then rode down the hill, only to find out we forgot the brakes. After running into the bushes a few times, we learned to solve the problem. We would leave home in the morning and play all day, as long as we were back when the street lights<br>
came on. No one was able to reach us all day. No cell phones. Un-thinkable.<br>
<br>
We did not have Playstations, Nintendo 64, X-Boxes, no video games at all, no 99 channels on cable, video tape movies, surround sound, personal cell phones, personal computers, or Internet chat rooms. We had friends! We went outside and found them. We played dodge ball, and sometimes, the ball would really hurt. We fell out of trees, got cut and broke bones and teeth, and there were no lawsuits from these accidents. They were accidents. No one was<br>
to blame but us. Remember accidents? We had fights and punched each other and got black and blue and learned to get over it. We made up games with sticks and tennis balls, and although we were told it would happen, we did<br>
not put out very many eyes.<br>
<br>
We rode bikes or walked to a friend's home and knocked on the door, or rang the bell or just walked in and talked to them. Little League had tryouts and not everyone made the team. Those who didn't had to learn to deal with disappointment. Some students weren't as smart as others, so they failed a grade and were held back to repeat the same grade. Horrors! Tests were not adjusted for any reason.<br>
<br>
Our actions were our own. Consequences were expected. The idea of a parent bailing us out if we broke a law was unheard of. They actually sided with the law. Imagine that!<br>
<br>
This generation has produced some of the best risk-takers and problem solvers and inventors, ever. The past 50 years have been an explosion of innovation and new ideas. We had freedom, failure, success and responsibility, and we learned how to deal with it all. <br>
<br>
And if you're one of those who have had the luck to grow up as kids,before lawyers and government regulated our lives, for our own good CONGRATULATIONS!. Kind of makes you want to run through the house with scissors, doesn't it!?<br>

I remember very clearly having the street light curfew.  If I was need before that, my dad just whistled - I could hear this whistle blocks away - and I knew it was time to go.  <br>
<br>
I made mud pies, and actually brought them in the house.  Germ-X didn't exist, thank God.  I took bathes with my girl-friends when we had slumber parties.  We always shared food and drinks... it just wasn't an issue.  I went to Brownies and Girl Scouts - do little girls even do this any more?  I picked and <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>ate</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> blackberries - no washing them!  We had a pomegranite tree... stains like nothing else, but was so yummy!<br>

I have great, &quot;untainted&quot;, childhood memories.

LOL!  I actually did this last night..   It made me happy...<br>
<br>
I am 29 and I believe I still fit in this category.  I try and raise my kids similarly, but living where we have in the past, it is just smarter to keep a pretty close eye on them.  <br>
<br>
Hehe<br>
<br>
Yeah.. Some parents may think I'm careless about my kids when they fall and I don't go rushing to pick them up , or when I let them see how far they can jump off of the stairs.  I have had other people run after my kids and look up at me and in almost disbelief when I didn't do the same.  If I felt they were in REAL danger, of coarse i would run to their side or yank them away and tell them what a stupid idea that was.  Kids have to learn from their mistakes.  They have to fall and scrape themselves.  It is a part of life.  <br>
<br>
Don't you all remember how fun it was to exchange battle wound stories and compare scabs scars and stitches.  I am so proud of my girls.  My oldest last year bumped her head under the bed and hit a nail and had to get three staples in her head.  Not once did that kid cry. <br>
<br>
Two days ago my daughter asked me why other kids at school cry a lot and why doesn't she.   I didn't quite know what to tell her.  She really caught me off guard.  She told me that she was more grown up then them.. I feel their moms are just to over protective.  The kids have problems going anywhere even over to our house for a play-date.. (now that is a word that just makes me laugh.. we never had play-dates, we played with kids in the neighborhood and that was it.. we didn't drive to go to someone's house.. ).. Oh well.. <br>
<br>
Ok.. enough bragging.. *giggle*  But I don't let my kids run off outside  by themselves though.  We have a big enough back yard to explore for now, and I can keep an ear out for them.  But when they get bigger I have an idea.  I saw these really cool radios (walkie talkies) that are like wrist watches that reach up to 7 miles.  I am so investing in those.  That is something I would have wanted as a kid and they are just so neat.. I kinda just want one for myself and am using the kids as an excuse.. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://linarya.topcities.com/ayra.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

My wife and I sat around the other night and I saw the commercial for anti-bacterial XXX soap. I looked at her and said you know all the dang sicknesses people have now and all the junk that is resistant YOU DON'T THINK WE BROUGHT IT ON OURSELVES DO YOU? I mean think about it my mom cleaned the house but she did not pour bleach on everything and run around with anti-bacterial hand cleaner to the park. What is funny if you think about it you would think she would have as she was a RN (Registered Nurse). I think we are babying the children way to much and need to correct this before we end up with problems. <br>

I sooooo remember doing this!  We would use my little cousin as a crash test dummy, and when he split his arm open to the bone, we wrapped my mom's kotex pads around his arm to stop the bleeding... (my poor cousin is still embarassed about going to the hospital w/feminine hygene products taped to his arm! lol )<br>

I used to be married to a high school teacher, and the stories he tells are soooooooo disturbing.  He gets calls if his students are failing (which is good) but they almost all blame HIM for their kids failing instead of the kids.  I'm here to tell you, no matter HOW bad a teacher is, 90% of the learning is the student.  I had the worst Algebra teacher in high school and while most of the class failed, myself and 4 other students passed with A's because WE had the brains to ask for help from other sources.  <br>
<br>
This overprotectivess is breeding weakness and laziness and I have ZERO patience for either.  No wonder I shudder every time I enter a mall or movie theatre and hear what drivel comes out of teenage mouths these days.  My friends and I used to have REAL discussions when we hung out, not playing with our ring tones on our cell phones and seeing who can draw the most looks by saying tactless things in loud voices.  <br>

Far more of them were just occasionally idiots.  If you think kids are being coddled too much and aren't having proper virtues instilled in them now-a-days, well, join the thousands of generations of adults who have been saying the same thing since humanity first walked the earth.<br>
<br>
Perhaps you will say that TPR posters are unusual... but those who are publicly &quot;out&quot; about their under 18 status (Fula comes to mind) seem to be unspoiled*, intellegent, and generally fine human beings, at least to me.<br>
<br>
That's one thing I've liked about the internet and EQ.  It allows one the an opportunity to interact with others without the pre-judgement/bias or discomfort that often (or possibly inevitably) comes with a face to face meeting.  <br>
<br>
<br>

*As much as any woman or girl isn't spoiled (/em ducks!)<br>

I remember riding my bike behind the mosquito truck when I was a kid. (I grew up in Florida)  Sure my parents told us not to do it but me and my friends loved riding around in the mist, mouths open giggleing like idiots.  25 years later still no side effects.<br>
Thanks for posting this.<br>
