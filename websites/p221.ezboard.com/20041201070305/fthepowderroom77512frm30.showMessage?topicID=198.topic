<br>
Just this side of heaven is a place called Rainbow Bridge. <br>
When an animal dies that has been especially close to someone here, that pet goes to Rainbow Bridge. There are meadows and hills for all of our special friends so they can run and play together. There is plenty of food, water and sunshine, and our friends are warm and comfortable.<br>
 <br>
All the animals who had been ill and old are restored to health and vigor. Those who were hurt or maimed are made whole and strong again, just as we remember them in our dreams of days and times gone by. The animals are happy and content, except for one small thing; they each miss someone very special to them, who had to be left behind. <br>
They all run and play together, but the day comes when one suddenly stops and looks into the distance. His bright eyes are intent. His eager body quivers. Suddenly he begins to run from the group, flying over the green grass, his legs carrying him faster and faster. <br>
<br>
You have been spotted, and when you and your special friend finally meet, you cling together in joyous reunion, never to be parted again. The happy kisses rain upon your face; your hands again caress the beloved head, and you look once more into the trusting eyes of your pet, so long gone from your life but never absent from your heart. <br>
<br>
Then you cross Rainbow Bridge together....  <br>

<br>
her passing was sudden and unexpected leaving our hearts greiving. There were verry few signs that she might have been Ill and her death is still a mystery to us even after the neicropsy. It may have been Kidney Failure or a heart attack. even the vet is not 100% certain.<br>
<br>
Tachi Renee entered out lives on the very first day we took our Son to Pre school. A spunky yet shy ball of bright orange fluff with too much skin for her body she was irresistable! <br>
 She was very shy and sweet as she bonded with us she grew fiercely  protective and undyingly loyal to me in particular. She was a funny clowny dog, with a quiet comforting nature at times allways ready willing and able to be loved.<br>
<br>
 She brought imeasurable love and happyness to us for 5 long years and we hope she Knew how much she was Loved and how much Joy she brought to us.<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>This is a story my husband wrote about our cats Salem and Tyler for a college english class he was taking.<br>
<br>
        I remember last August my life was changed. My wife, Vanessa, and I had just settled in our new house. We were happy, but something was missing. Both of us had always had a cat in the house. We both felt that we needed to have the presence of a kitty in our house. Our friend, David, who had altogether too many cats in his household, was more that happy to give us some.<br>
        “We have some kittens whose mama died from spinal meningitis. They really need someone to take care of them,” David said.<br>
        Not being one to refuse an animal in dire need of a good home, I took Vanessa to David’s house to look at them. There were five little kittens, barely a month old, looking scared and lonely in David’s basement. We settled on two: an adorable little mackerel tabby, which we named Tyler, and a solid black kitten, which we named Salem.<br>
        As the months went by, Salem and Tyler quickly became part of our lives. At first, the little fluff balls were scared, being disrupted from their regular routines by the death of their mother, and the abrupt translocation. Soon, the feline siblings relaxed, and became part of the family.<br>
        I still remember Tyler. As he grew older, he turned into the stereotypical tomcat. He was big, burly, and always getting into things he wasn’t supposed to. Such as the time we had to tear open the upholstery on our sofa because Tyler decided he was going to explore the mysterious realm contained within. Or how he was always darting between our legs, then hiding in the computer room so he could snack on the various houseplants we hid in there. He was always playful, eyes always shining with mischief. He was so vivacious and healthy. That’s why it was such a shock when he became ill.<br>
        A week after his neutering and declawing, I noticed a change. Tyler became sluggish and antisocial. After seeing him limp a few feet, only to collapse in a heap, and seeing him hissing violently at Salem when she came within a few feet, I knew something was deeply wrong. A visit to the vet shook our lives to the core. Tyler had a terminal disease, feline leukemia. He was going to die. And to add to the crushing blow, the vet told us that leukemia is highly contagious. In short, Salem had it too.<br>
        The next couple months were pure hell. I had to watch as my rowdy tomcat slowly decayed before my eyes, his body withering as he was ravaged by the disease. In a couple short months Tyler went from a healthy fifteen pounds to an emaciated eight pounds. We tried everything; high calorie cat food, protein supplements, antibiotics, but to no avail. We wrapped him in a blue towel to protect his skeletal form from the February chill and took him to the vet for the last time. The look in his large, gray eyes as we set him on the cold examination table will haunt me forever. He yelped as Dr. Carleton gave him the injection, and then closed his eyes; finally free of the terrible pain he must have felt.<br>
        On February 13th, 2001, we buried Tyler in our back yard, near our rose bush. (A fitting place, as he always tried to eat any roses I gave my wife.) I still visit where he was laid to rest, remembering what he was like.<br>
        The next few weeks were difficult, but not as hard as the preceding months. Vanessa and I were devastated, and every time Salem ran through the house yowling for her brother my heart broke. After about a month, we slowly returned to normal, and Salem became her prim, proper, graceful self. She was the epitome of feline conceit, but always willing to snuggle in your lap. Where Tyler was a rough-and-tumble kind of cat, Salem was dignified, never making two movements when one would do.<br>
        Salem is now in her autumn. The disease her body has fought off for over a year is slowly winning. Her body is wasting away just like Tyler’s did. Seeing how weak she is, and watching as her hips, spine, and ribs protrude more through her dissolving muscles day by day, tells me it won’t be long before we take her to the vet for the last time.<br>
<br>
<br>
A small update to this story: We now have three cats, Lidda, Heidi and Razzberry. They are altered, but their claws are intact, as will be any future cats. I still regret letting them take Tyler's claws. It wouldnt have prevented his death, but it would have delayed it and made him happier while he was here.<br>
<br>
I dearly miss Salem and Tyler. Salem and I would have Meow conversations often. I would walk in the room and she would meow at me, so I would meow back, and it was almsot like we were conversing. So cute  <br>
<br>
Happy New years <br>

My little Tippy of 14 years has crossed over the rainbow bridge.  She passed about a week before christmass.  I was too heartbroken to talk about it before this.  She was my little sweat heart.  I will miss her so much! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.mywhimsy.com/boards/dvicons/sad.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I will always remember her as my little klutsy kitty.  She was so much like me it was so funny.  Anyone who knows me in real life knows if there is a coffee table in the room I will find it with my shin at least 5 times in one night.  She was just the same. Always missing her jumps(never hurt herself mind you), always finding the bottem rails on the tables she would run under with her head.  God knows how many times I comforted her. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :hug --><img src=http://www.mywhimsy.com/boards/dvicons/emhug.gif ALT=":hug"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   She always kept the metality of a kitten.  Always had her spunky moments. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.mywhimsy.com/boards/dvicons/emcheerful.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
She had gotten really sick a week before she passed and I didn't realize the signs untill too late.  Never have had a cat before this she was my first expeirience with an older cat.  I wish I would have taken her to the vet sooner.  I just hope she didn't go through too much pain before she passed on.  <br>
<br>

This tuesday my 19 year old cat passed away. She was a beautiful black and brown tiger striped kitty named Cindy. We often called her Sinister, Mama Cat, and Mamacita. She was part domestic short hair part siamese, which gave her quite a personality. She used to wake my mother and I up in the morning by meowing for us to come down and have coffee with her, because of the siamese in her her meows often sounded like human words, such as hello, yes, and no. She always loved to knock over milk glasses and wash my mother's hair with her sandpaper tounge. Even on her last day she got up in the morning and laid down next to my mother in their morning yoga ritual. She was always there with my two other cats to greet me at the door with a cheerful purr. She was a natural mother, when we adopted our two kittens, she actually produced milk and nursed and raised them. <br>
<br>
Funny thing is, we almost never got her. When I was nine my mother was adopting two kittens for me, the animal rescue told us about a nine year old cat who was going to be put to sleep because her owners could not have her anymore. My mother was hesitant to take a nine year old cat because she didn't want me to grow attached to a cat that would die a year or so later, but the animal shelter convinced her to take Cindy in. She was the first thing in our new house, I remember walking into the house after school and seeing no furnature or anything, but a kitty litter box. I then saw Cindy. I fell in love with this cat, I even used to write a journal about her when I was younger.<br>
<br>
For ten years Cindy was in my life, she was royalty in my household, she ruled supreme and my other cats knew it. But she was also a friend, she was there to listen to my trials of growing up, she was there through break ups, fights, and my mother's second divorce. She always listened and always purred.<br>
<br>
My mother told me that when she came home at 6 on Tuesday she could tell Cindy was not doing well. But when she held Cindy, she still purred for her. My mother was not sure what time I would be home, and she could tell Cindy was struggling to stay alive to say her goodbyes. She held her in a warm towel. At around 8 o'clock she could see Cindy was still attempting to hang in there for me, she held her close and told her that I would understand if she went, and that I would want her to be comfortable. As soon as my mother told her that, Cindy's breathing became less labored, she relaxed and breathed normally and let herself go.<br>
<br>
Everyone in my family misses this wonderful animal, I have cried nonstop over these past few days... Its so hard to not be woken up by her, or to pull back the shower curtain and not find her there drinking water from the tub (one of her stubborn habits), and everytime I walk into my house and only two cats meet me at the door my heart breaks.<br>
<br>
My mother buried her in the yard in a place she used to sneak out of the house to lay in the sun. We would always catch her there when she would run out of the house on us. I've gone outside and talked to her a few times. I know time heals all wounds, but the wait is excruciating. <br>
<br>
I love you Cindy, I hope you are in a better place now. Thank you for always being my guardian. <br>

Our Sweet and beloved <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://community.webshots.com/photo/96474699/96475702ScnACP" target="top">Doberman Boudreaux</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> passed away yesterday while we were out of the house paying bills. it seems he had a sezure and passed away.<br>
<br>
Boudreaux was 12 years old and had been with our family for the last 6 years. he was a wonderful quiet and reserved old fellow, who's favorite thing was lounging arround like a bump on a log.<br>
He was going blind with age and had a stage 4 heart murmer, he was recently diagnosed with an agressive Cancer in his Jaw which yesterday the vet says she feels may have been in his brain and ultimatly caused his passing. <br>
<br>
Everyone loved this old man.<br>
<br>
Our hearts are all broken again, we have lost so many beloved friends this past year- Tachi, Pixi and now Boudreaux- <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#9AB3CA><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://p221.ezboard.com/bthepowderroom77512.showUserPublicProfile?gid=libbiefv>Libbie FV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>TPR Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/23/04 1:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p221.ezboard.com/fthepowderroom77512frm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=198.topic&index=8>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Rainbow Bridge</span><hr size=1> Awww.

I lost an older cat of mine the same way a few years back.  I was very glad that it was quick and she suffered no lasting pain from it.<br>
