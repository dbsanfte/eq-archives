<br>
I just recently finished my college classes and started an 8 week work experiance. I am a computer/internet programmer. The company I am now working for has a great reputation and recently just restructured meaning after our job experiance there is a HIGH % chance of a job. That is why me and my friend from school jumped at the oportunity. At first this was a dream come true. Me and the only other girl in our college taking the same courses (Programming) managed to get a job not only in same office working on the same project! AND there is no dress code, no starting time, and no set time we have to stay till. What more could we ask for?<br>
<br>
Well as all things sometimes they can be too good to be true. Our boss is the recently a pionted CEO. He is only 30 and one of those 'high achievers'. Graduated from high school at 13 and then college/univercity at 20.. by the age of 25 he had created and sold two sucesfful companies and then stopped working till last year when he was higered to restructure this company. <br>
<br>
Why is it smart men are ALWAYS the most imature? HE LOVes to listen to himself talk. Me and my friend are the only two females in the office. We generally sit with the sales department. Now there is one guy there that is great (we think he is gay and he loves to make us jam and stuff haha and chit chat about all stuff) Then there is the boss's best (head of sales department) friend my god.. they are these big and powerful business men who can be soo smooth and sauave on the phone or in a meeting but once that call is over or the meeting door closed they become complete and utter jerks. Their maturity lvl drops about 10-15 years. They make fun of women, sex, ppls education and my god they cant say anything with out having to swear word every second word. (i hate that!)<br>
<br>
Its like they are trying to act all cool but end up looking like fools most the time. I get tired of hearing their weekend 'romp' stories with rum and coke, or what ever other drink they tend to talk alot about. I dont want to hear what girl was at hteir house and I DONT WANT to hear as they put it 'dinner' partners god how old do they think we are? Its called SEX PPLS!<br>
<br>
This one really nice girl that our boss see's comes in and meets him for lunch ALL the time the other day the gay one asked if she was his gf and he made light of it and called her his 'dinner' partner and his best friend laughed and said 'wait till she finds that out' then they both laughed and I just felt so bad for her becase we all can see how much she likes him.<br>
<br>
He took me and my friend out for lunch a few weeks ago and all he could talk about was himself how much money he made how he has been soo sucessful about the dates he has been on and his last bday party where he invited 40ppls and ended up with 140 or something like that. I had stopped listening by then and was concentrating on holding down my salad.<br>
<br>
Now we get to the good stuff! He has us working on an ASP website for a few univercities in the US( btw I am from Canada) This is all fine however there is NO user interface yet (he has a graphic artis suposedly working on it) and he expects us to code the back end iwth out seeing the actual page flow... ok then there is no actual writen expectations. We are exepeted to I guess read his mind and figure out all the diffrent functions of each page ... he gave us one frame set and then one links page... that dont have anything even in them. When we ask to meet with him on the details he keeps telling us to 'leave it till later' and 'move to something else for now' . We ARE RUNNING OUT OF PLACES TO MOVE TOO THERE MAN! <br>
<br>
phew sorry... lost control there hehe well you get the picture. He is pushing us to get it done too... so my friend and i decided to well put huge messages on all hte pages<br>
<br>
&quot; WE NEED INFO TO FINISH THIS PAGE &quot;<br>
<br>
lets see if he gets the hint...<br>
<br>
I think this rant has lasted way long enough hahahahahah.... <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www3.telus.net/legacychosen/sharia-sig.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Signature By <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://dwolf.tv/goldleaf/index.html">Culurien</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> for <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub16.ezboard.com/bnorrathsstudio" target="top">Norrath Studio's </a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->  <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub16.ezboard.com/fnorrathsstudiofrm12.showMessage?topicID=47.topic">Secret Santa</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->View my artwork <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub32.ezboard.com/flegacy10297frm29" target="top">Here </a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub32.ezboard.com/blegacy10297">Legacy of the Chosen </a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#B4C8DA><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub238.ezboard.com/bthepowderroom77512.showUserPublicProfile?gid=taylonmys>Taylon Mys</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Fair Maiden</span><br>  Posts: 34<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/10/03 11:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p221.ezboard.com/fthepowderroom77512frm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=38.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.imgmag.org/images/silena/Taylon.gif HEIGHT=50 WIDTH=80></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: EVIL BOSSES!!!!!!!</span><hr size=1> WOW you really needed to get that off your chest /comfort.

What a evil boss! I feel your pain, dear. My boss is about as bitchy as they come. She is 52 years old working in a fitness center with everyone else under age 30, except some aerobics instructors. She acts as if she is the smartest thing since sliced bread because she has a masters degree and although she has absolutly no management experience, but because she has a degree, the owners opted to make her GM (general manager). She is very blunt about what she thinks, and she is very opinionated, when she really needs to keep her mouth shut. She has a lack of professionalism that would put your boss to shame, including yelling/fussing at employees in out the open where members can witness. You cannot rely on what she says to you either, unless you get it in writing. For example, she tells me to do one report one way and for ONE YEAR she waits to tell me that I am doing it wrong and using the wrong information. She asked me to redo the report for the entire year of 2002! I turn this report in every freakin month and she decides to wait until Jan 2003, to tell me I am doing it wrong and every month needs to be redone! I was fit to be tied that day!<br>
<br>
She also has lost all of her friends while working here, and I mean ALL of them. Most of the aerobics instructors that work here were all friends with her like...10 years+ and little by little, she has ticked each one off and been unfair to them. She even told one instructor that she could not be her friend and manager. Ok, I realize that being a manager has it's ups and downs, and yeah, you are going to lose some friends when you work together and that you must keep a professional attitude while at work, but is that a reason to have a nasty attitude?<br>
<br>
Anyway, thanks for listening and sorry for invading your post, Sharia. But as it just so happens, I was fixing to make a post about this same thing! hehe.   <p>Gytana Goldenleaf<br>

Which is why I love being in a strong Union and working in the Public sector. <br>
If that asshole tried to pull that shit here, his ass would be dragged into the Industrial Relations Commission and he's get slapped down faster than an orc Pawn in a newbie zone.<br>
Queensland (Australia) has very strong laws relating to workplace conduct, especially bullying. It's just not tolerated. You have to be very careful how you treat people. No bullying them, no intimidating them, no swearing at them, no sexual or offensive talk or actions infront of someone. If a person believes what you are doing is offensive or such, then they can take you off to court.<br>
I'm very glad we have strong Unionism here in Australia.<br>
<br>
Our current Boss is an Asshole. He has no respect for his workers, likes to try and bully staff and generally make things difficult. When he first started with us, 3 yrs ago, we didn't know much about Industrial Relations Law and fair work practises. he rode rough shod over us and treated us like crap. So a group of us broke away from the Union, we were part off (who at the time didn't want to help us...) and we started our own Union.<br>
With the help of the Australian Transport Workers Union, (kind of our sponsers) we learnt Industrial law and workplace conduct policies. We backed ourselves and came down on our boss bigtime. So far we have had him in court eight times, for verious things, from bullying, to harrassement, to unfair dismissal. So fair we have won eight cases from eight.<br>
He's cost Queensland Health many thousands of dollars in legal fees and damages awarded and he's toned down his attitude greatly. <br>
The bastard watches what he says now...<br>
<br>
My advice, even for private sector workers. Check up on your Local, State and Federal Government Workplace and Industrial Relations laws and codes of conduct. Employers are required to provide safe and non-threatening work environments for their workers. You might be suprised what you find out. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://lagduff.mine.nu/Lagduffsig1.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><br>

I just remembered a story from a few years ago, that you might get a laugh from.<br>
it relates to high achievers and a new young Doctor, who thought he was God's gift.<br>
<br>
Story goes...<br>
<br>
Aparently he walks into the canteen at work and it's his turn to be served. The lady behind the hot food counter is sitting down. It's Summer and hot and she is tired. She politey asks the Doctor what he would like to eat.<br>
Dr &quot;My Shit Doesn't Stink&quot; says, &quot;You can stand up and take my order, when you talk to me, I'm a Doctor.&quot; or words to those effect. Lot's of attitude...<br>
<br>
Well the next day the same Doctor is asked to go and speak to the Director of Surgery. He gets his ass dragged across hot coals by the Director and threatened with being sacked.<br>
The lady who he spoke so rudely to, the day before, was the Director's wife who does volunteer work in the Hospital canteen.<br>
<br>
I love karma... <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://lagduff.mine.nu/Lagduffsig1.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><br>

Anyways, our office had 5 women, and 3 men.  Our manager was one of the men, and he was a total &amp; complete ass to the workers.  He thought nothing of reprimanding an employee in front of other employees, and customers.  He would make crude sexual jokes (even some about employees).  He would berate customers and even make some cry - he seemed to find joy in that.  He suffers from what I call 'small man syndrome'.  <br>
<br>
Anyways, all 5 of us women had enough, and we wrote a letter to Human Resourses in Toronto.  We included a fact sheet with all dates &amp; incidents written down.  We purolated the letter directly to the president of H/R marked 'confidential'.  He called us as soon as he read that letter.  He did a mini - interview over the phone with each of us, and on Monday the following week, Him, the Regional Manager, and the District manager were in our office to interview our manager.<br>
<br>
We had a new manager start on the next Monday.  I sortof felt bad for the prev manager losing his job, but then I remembered how much of an ass he was, and how he treated me.  I feel bad that he had a wife &amp; 3 children to support, but it was due to his own actions that he lost his job.<br>
<br>
We are not part of a union, however our H/R department takes things like this very seriously.  They do not want a lawsuit to deal with, or bad publicity.  <br>
<br>
I would suggest that you keep a diary of any and all things he does that you find offensive.  Record the dates/times &amp; what happened.  You never know when you may need it.<br>

<br>
An excellent suggestion!<br>
<br>
If you want to put your &quot;Evil&quot; Boss on the wrong foot, when he starts talking, pull out a small note book and pen and start taking notes. Date and time everything.<br>
Boss: &quot;What are you doing?&quot;<br>
Me: &quot;I'm taking notes.&quot;<br>
Boss: &quot;Oh...&quot; <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Boss rethinks what he is going to say...</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
it can realy put a Boss off, if he's an asshole, cause he wonders what you are going to do with those notes.<br>
We have one guy in our union who takes a mini-recorder to every meeting with our Boss. Pisses the Boss right off, but nothing he can do about it.<br>
And ALWAYS take someone, &quot;A support person&quot;, with you, when you have to go to a meeting with your Boss. NEVER go alone. <br>
I don't know about the Private sector, but here we can refuse to go to any meeting, with the Boss or anyone, if we are not comfortable with the idea or can't bring a support person. i did it 2 weeks ago.<br>
Boss left a message on my timesheet, that I was to see him the next morning at 6am. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>(I work nightshift)</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> So I had 9 hours notice, it was 9pm and I wasn't able to contact or arrange for someone to come with me to the meeting. So next morning I went to the Boss and told him he would have to reschedule the meeting for later in the week, so i could organise a Union Rep to be with me. He spat chips, but there was nothing he could do about it. I had the meeting two days later, with my Union Rep. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://lagduff.mine.nu/Lagduffsig1.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><br>
