<br>
This may sound like an absurd notion, but believe it or not, you can love your pet to death. Millions of pet owners consider their fuzzy/feathered companions as members of the family. These same people even go as far as treating their pet as a human...eating human food, giving kisses, sharing beds, or even sharing food (literally). Can these loving, adoring pet owners be doing more harm than good? <br>
<br>
We all love fat, whether it be in the form of tasty oil in our cookies or a thin, juicy layer around our steak. Fat makes everything taste better. Our love affair with fat (in all its forms) is evident by the ever rising percentage of people struggling with weight and weight related diseases (diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, etc). In America alone, an estimated 127 million people are overweight. So what does this have to do with our pets? More than you think.<br>
<br>
Mirroring their owner's struggle, one in two pets in the United States are overweight or obese. Obesity is now the number one disease affecting pets today. Dogs and cats love flavorable foods as much as we do. They are eager to eat the piece of sausage, steak, gravy, chicken, cake, peanut butter or cookie that we offer them out of affection. Add that to lack of exercise and you have the beginning of a disasterous relationship. Although you love your pet, you could be killing them.<br>
<br>
Pancreatitis is an inflammation of the pancreas. It is painful, can be difficult to diagnose, expensive to treat, and can be caused by a high fat lifestyle, or obesity with lack of exercise (among a few other causes). Before you give your Yorkie a bit of your breakfast sausage or buttered toast, remember that his body doesn't process fats as well as yours may do. <br>
<br>
Other conditions associated with obesity:<br>
<br>
Shortness of breath<br>
<br>
Heat Stress<br>
<br>
Fatigue - It's hard carrying around that extra weight.<br>
<br>
Endocrine Diseases - Like Cushing's, Addison's, Diabetes, Hypothyroidism, Etc<br>
<br>
Heart problems - Like their humans, pets don't do well with fat sitting on their heart.<br>
<br>
Liver disease - Think fat cats are cute? They may be adorable, but they are also in a dangerous condition that could lead to a liver condition called Hipatic Lipadosis, a serious disease that can be fatal. <br>
<br>
Joint stress - Ruptured ligaments in the knees is common in overweight dogs and even in cats. Obese dogs also have higher incidence of hip dysplasia. <br>
<br>
Skin problems<br>
<br>
Infectious diseases<br>
<br>
Gastrointestinal disorders<br>
<br>
So now you know what can happen to your loved, but chubby, pet; the risks associated with having that adorably round canine/feline. But what do you do about bettering their chances for a healthier life? First and foremost, exercise. Walking will help you and your pet with weight problems and can be a bonding experience. Discover trails around your city together, walk to a nearby pond and let Fido take a swim, visit dog parks and walk around while your friend socializes with other of his/her kind. Taking bike rides can be shared as well. You can purchase &quot;dog joggers&quot; online or at any outdoor/pet store.<br>
<br>
However you decide to exercise your pet, remember to stay away from being a &quot;weekend warrior.&quot; Weekend Warriors are people (and pets) who cram a week's work of exercise into a Saturday afternoon. The stress that can occur can be detrimental to both you and your pet. Many dogs I've met with cruciate ligament damage were &quot;weekend warriors.&quot;<br>
<br>
Another way to help your friend lose weight is changing their diet (and yours). Lessen the amount of saturated fats from your diets and eat more veggies and fruits for snacks. Instead of giving Frenchie a cookie, hand him a carrot stick. Most dogs love vegetables, and will readily take the new treat. Just keep onions to yourself. Onions are toxic to dogs. The toxicity is dose dependent, so the bigger the animal, the more onion need be consumed to cause a toxicity. Onion toxicity causes a Heinz body anemia. <br>
<br>
Remember, the best way to start a weight loss plan is to visit your pet's doctor. They will be able to recommend how much exercise Fido can tolerate, and what foods/snacks are appropriate. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6B9388><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub238.ezboard.com/bthepowderroom77512.showUserPublicProfile?gid=drusila>Drusila</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/themes/blueMoon/unread.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span class=glowtitle> Lil' Miss Secret Recipe</span></span><br>  Posts: 542<br> <font color=#9BC9BE>(12/21/03 5:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p221.ezboard.com/fthepowderroom77512frm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=171.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Canine Health</span><hr size=1> This was posted by <!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:red;"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Sinafay Alinath</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> on :10/31/03 11:52 am<br>

<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:red;font-size:small;"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Holiday Reminders....</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
<br>
 Hello all and happy Halloween! Holidays are normally fun and exciting times of the year, but sometimes, we can forget about the impact it may have on our fuzzy or feathered companions. Let me throw out a few reminders so that your Halloween can be safe and fun for allyou friends and family.<br>
<br>
1) Sharing is nice, and sharing chocolate with our friends or siblings is always good. But, don't let your little ones share that Snickers bar with the family Chihuahua if you don't want an expensive detour to the emergency clinic. <br>
<br>
&quot;Chocolate contains theobromine (a compound similar to caffeine) which is poisonous to dogs. A dose of 50 mg/lb can be fatal to a dog. Milk chocolate contains 45 mg of theobromine per ounce and unsweetened baking chocolate contains 400 mg per ounce. Just one ounce of unsweetened baking chocolate can kill a small breed dog. Theobromine when ingested by dogs causes release of epinephrine (adrenaline) which causes the heart to race and serious cardiac arrhythmias to develop. Signs of chocolate poisoning in dogs include vomiting, diarrhea, excessive urination, hyperactivity followed by depression and coma, seizures, and death.&quot; -vetheart.com<br>
<br>
2) Be sure to keep your pets in a safe place during the night. People in strange masks and noisy costumes can frighten your dog (or cat). Also, Halloween is a favored night for pranksters, and pets can be in danger of being teased, stolen or even killed.<br>
<br>
3) Following the above reminder, be sure to keep your cats indoors or in a safe area of confinement. Ranging from malicious teen pranks to serious occult activity, cats (especially black ones) have historically been the victims of malicious acts on Halloween night.<br>
<br>
4) If you dress up your pet, make sure that is doesn't restrict movement or vision. They may be cute dressed up as a ghost, but your pups won't be enjoying themselves tripping over a sheet.<br>
<br>
5) Lastly, many adults throw Halloween parties, and this year will be no exception. Since Halloween is on a Friday this year, many houses will be filled with dancing, drinking, and eating devils and mummies. There are some people that think it amusing to see a drunk puppy. Please keep all alcohol products away from your pets. <br>
<br>
&quot;Dogs should never have alcoholic beverages. Don't let dogs roam freely when alcoholic beverages might be sitting on a table within reach, during or after a party. Though ill effects might be minor in a large dog, one ounce of a 20 to 40 proof alcoholic beverage be can cause alcohol poisoning or coma in a small dog.&quot; - Bella Online<br>
<br>
I hope these help keep your holiday happy and safe...for everyone. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#497166><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://p221.ezboard.com/bthepowderroom77512.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lyrral>Lyrral</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>TPR Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#9BC9BE>(6/24/04 11:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p221.ezboard.com/fthepowderroom77512frm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=171.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Canine Health</span><hr size=1> Just wanted to add something here with summer on us and it getting a lot warmer every day...  Just because your dog wants to take a ride in the car with you doesn't mean he should.<br>
<br>
While there are a large number of pet friendly businesses (Circuit City and Home Depot to name just a few) out there, your dog should *never* be left in the car by himself even with the windows down during the summer.<br>
<br>
Unless you can take your dog inside with you, everywhere you go, leave them at home.<br>

If I may add to what you stated, pet parents also should be mindful of how much outdoor exercise their pets engage in during warm weather.  <br>
<br>
The summer sun can bake asphalt and cement; just take a brief walk with bare feet during the day and you'll know what I'm talking about.  We have shoes to protect our precious tooties, but our pooches don't.  Be mindful of the time of day you choose to walk Fido so that he doesn't burn his paws.  <br>
<br>
In addition, try to time your walks in the morning or evenings...before the day grows too warm.  Fifi may do well after jogging a mile with you in the morning, but she might not feel well if you decided to go out after lunch.  <br>
<br>
If you are worried your dog is suffering from heat stress, there are a couple of things you can check to confirm your suspicions.  First, lift a lip and check their gum color.  If looking at their gums make you have flashbacks to the 80's and your hot pink spandex shorts, then your concern may be on target.  Offer a drink of cool water, some ice, wipe them down with a wet rag.....anything to cool your dog down and get their temperature down.  <br>
<br>
Another way of checking if your pet is overheated is by taking their temperature.  The most accurate way to do this is rectally, so get out the K-Y Jelly and a thermometer you won't be using anymore and stick it where the sun don't shine (seriously).  Your pup might not take kindly to this, so you may need someone to help you.  It's easiest is you use a digital thermometer.  A dog's normal temperature ranges from 101.5 - 102.5 degrees Farenheit.  If Fifi's temp reads 103, cool her down quick and give a call to your vet.<br>
<br>
If ever in doubt, pay a visit to a licensed animal practicioner.  It's always better to be safer than sorry, and your pet's life is nothing to leave to a guess.<br>
<br>
And before I end, be mindful of the pets you leave at home.  If they live outdoors, make sure they have plenty of clean water and a shaded area they can go to escape the sun.  Clean feces from their surrounding regularly to avoid fly bites among other problems that come with poo filled yards.  If your pet remains indoors while you are at work, make sure your house has sufficient air flow and your pet has plenty of water.  Keeping a ceiling fan on or leaving the air conditioning on should help your indoor pet remain comfortable.<br>
