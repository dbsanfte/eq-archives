<br>
She is 4 years older than me, making her 24.  She just barely graduated high school.  As in...we didn't know if she was going to graduate until the day of graduation.  She attempted to go to junior college, dropped out a week after classes started.  Lived at home off and on in the last 5 years.  A royal pain in my butt.  <br>
<br>
She spends my parents money like its her own.  They sent her to junior college...well I already told you about that.  They sent her to cosmotology school...she quit cause she hated one of her instructors.  $1000 down the drain!  She can't seem to understand that money doesn't grow on trees!<br>
<br>
Now she manages a Claire's store in our mall.  She's been at this job for over a year, and I must say, that impresses me beyond belief.  But you would think after a year she would start to figure out how to balance her money.  Nope.  Not her.<br>
<br>
She gets credit card after credit card and maxes them just as quickly.  Then she whines to mom about how she can't pay her car insurance next month cause she is broke.  Yet every time I see her she is telling me about the new $100 outfit she bought at the Buckle.  God she annoys me!<br>
<br>
Her most recent escapade...she overdrew her checking account &quot;only by $7&quot;.  So she calls mom and whines...mom gives in and calls me (dad's a semi driver, they were in NC at the time) to tell me to go deposit $50 into my sisters account from my parent's account (when its not summertime I'm in college 2 hours away from home, they put me on their checking account to make it a bit easier to access my loan money and such).  So I do as I'm told.  <br>
<br>
Well today...I get a call from her and I'm going to quote her exact terms...&quot;You stupid bitch, you didn't put that money in my account so now I can't go out tonite and the bank says I'm overdrawn $104 now&quot;.  How nice.  I did in fact deposit the money.  Even called to verify it.  I just love how she blames everyone else for her problems but herself.  I realize that our parents spoil all of us...but I just don't understand how she can be the way she is...even though she was raised exactly the same as I was.<br>
<br>
She called back later and told me that she forgot about her automatic charge from the place where she tans and that was what made her over draw...there was no apology or anything.  That just pissed me off even more.  I said...Gee Nikki its nice to see that getting a fake tan in the middle of the summer is more important that appreciating your sister and you parents because we do more for you than you realize and you treat us like crap...and then hung up.  She called back but I refused to talk to her.<br>
<br>
GRRRRRRRRRRRRRR  Sorry I love my sister too pieces because she is my sister...but if she wasn't I would not even know her.  We are night and day.  I don't know how much longer I can deal with her before I really say something mean and really hurt her feelings.  But dammit I am tired of her not thinking about anyone but herself.  Its annoying and just down right pisses me off!<br>
<br>
Heh ok I think I'm done...I just needed to get that off my chest... <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=226786" target="top">Venerable Jaeydee Faylestar</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Prophet<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=688258" target="top">Sallty Popkorn</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->27 Monk<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub238.ezboard.com/bthepowderroom77512"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.mywhimsy.com/boards/powderroom/PRTwinkyellow.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#B4C8DA><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub238.ezboard.com/bthepowderroom77512.showUserPublicProfile?gid=taylonmys>Taylon Mys</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span class=glowtitle>Lil' Miss Powah'</span></span><br>  Posts: 179<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/19/03 8:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p221.ezboard.com/fthepowderroom77512frm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=50.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.imgmag.org/images/silena/Taylon.gif HEIGHT=50 WIDTH=80></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Annoying sisters!!!!</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :hug --><img src=http://www.mywhimsy.com/boards/dvicons/emhug.gif ALT=":hug"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :hug --><img src=http://www.mywhimsy.com/boards/dvicons/emhug.gif ALT=":hug"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :hug --><img src=http://www.mywhimsy.com/boards/dvicons/emhug.gif ALT=":hug"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :hug --><img src=http://www.mywhimsy.com/boards/dvicons/emhug.gif ALT=":hug"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :comfort --><img src=http://www.mywhimsy.com/boards/dvicons/smlycomfort.gif ALT=":comfort"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Im an only child, but my husband has a little sister.

My sister is the biggest deadbeat you've ever met, she skirted from menial job to menial job, accumulating debts, divorces and one kid as she went. <br>
<br>
She finally managed to get a job working for Microsoft, seemed to turn her life around, but then Microsoft decided they didn't need her job anymore and pressured her to the point they could fire her. She had a very good case to bring a lawsuit against them, (the pressure and harassment had left her with an eating disorder, among other things,) instead she just slacked off and let it go. <br>
<br>
She's been slacking ever since, was almost evicted from her house, (I had to loan her the money to keep her from being homeless.) She's now filing for chapter 11 or 13, (whichever reorganization and reconsolidation is,) and faces eviction again, this time from me because she hasn't payed me back a single penny of the loan in over 9 months. <br>
<br>
Not to mention that my parents try to see her kid as much as possible because my sister doesn't do things like keep him active, or clean, or anything.<br>
<br>
You know, I hate to say it...but some people just strike me as born losers. They either never put it together, or sabotage anything they do. My sister drives me nuts, and to be honest, I'm pretty much done having anything to do with her. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#B4C8DA><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub238.ezboard.com/bthepowderroom77512.showUserPublicProfile?gid=texann95>Texann95</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lil' Miss 'Give Me<br>Perfume or Give Me<br>Death!</span><br>  Posts: 27<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/19/03 2:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p221.ezboard.com/fthepowderroom77512frm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=50.topic&index=3>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Annoying sisters!!!!</span><hr size=1> I know where yall are coming from...if people ask me about my sister...I just tell them she is a one woman episode of Jerry Springer.  I will *TRY* (key word) to make this short &amp; to the point because I could go on forever.<br>
<br>
* Met a loser in high school - 1st guy she slept with&amp; &quot;fell in love&quot; with him ...he emotionally abused her I can't prove physical abuse but I think it was there too.<br>
* Married aforementioned loser...he cheated on her the whole time but from what I've heard she wasn't totally innocent either.<br>
* Moved in with a friend from childhood &amp; went thru sort of a wild child phase..that included 1 miscarriage (her 2nd one she had one while married). Miscarriage best thing to happen because the father was an alcoholic who my sis took home to meet mom &amp; dad while he was DRUNK!<br>
* Suddenly she decides to move to San Antonio (from Ft. Worth).  <br>
* ON my birthday, I get a call from a childhood friend telling me she got the birth announcement from my sis..I was like huh? My friend just about DIED when she realized I had no clue what she was talking about.  Mom called the next day &amp; was quite relieved that I already knew because she didn't know how to tell me.<br>
* Then 13 months later Mom asks Sis, are you preg? Sis says NO!! 3 days later Mom gets a call from Sis...Um I just had a baby!  I was SOOO pissed off it was unreal.<br>
* Finally met the father of both kids after the second one was born.<br>
* Mom reads the local paper &amp; sees that Sis &amp; Father of kids got a marriage license &amp; are MARRIED!!! Sis claims that she told Mom...Mom's like Bullshit! <br>
* My sis has had more repossessed cars &amp; bounced checks etc than you can imagine.  <br>
<br>
And that, dear ladies &amp; gentlemen, is the synopsis of my Sister...the One Woman Jerry Springer episode!<br>
<br>
Sad thing is my husband's sister is very similar to my sister...<br>

I truly think there are some people who never realize that they are perpetuating their own demise. They blame others for their personal problems and such. I know one person comes to mind for this kinda crap.<br>
<br>
I say, time for some tough love for these folks.<br>
<br>
Kick em out, shut em out, tell them - I love you, but you need to get your shit together.<br>

My sister is not that terrible, but just wierd. I am not sure why some people can not get their life straightened out. Maybe they expect society to bail them out because they can't rationalize? I am not sure, but I pity them and can't help because I am not really rich or anything. . <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=585568">My Magelo Profile</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
