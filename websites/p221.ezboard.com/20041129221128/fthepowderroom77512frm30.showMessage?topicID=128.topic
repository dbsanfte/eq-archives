I hate people who can't keep their &quot;cat hate&quot; comments to themselves, and I'd appreciate not seeing any of the &quot;get rid of him&quot;, &quot;put him down&quot;, or &quot;cats are nasty, that's what you get&quot; remarks.  Thanks in advance.<br>
<br>
I've had Sunny since he could fit in the palm of my hand, almost 11 years.  He's traveled down every rough road with me, and back again.  He's been like a child to me.<br>
<br>
Let me start by saying that for 9 years, Sunny was primarily a hard-food cat.  Canned/wet food was reserved for very rare occassions.  When I went on my honeymoon, he stayed with my mom, who decided this method of feeding wasn't acceptable, since it wasn't what she did for her cats.  Sunny has been an asshole every since - 18 months.<br>
<br>
Well, my &quot;child&quot; has started misbaving in a way that I can't seem to get a handle on... it has to do with his food.  It seems that if he doesn't get fed what he wants, and when he wants it, he goes nuts.  I'm not talking about just soft food here - it's gotten to the point where if he doesn't like or isn't in the mood for the flavor I put out, he turns into Satan.  He starts by literally knocking things down off tables, counters, desks... breaking or demolishing just about anything he can reach.  If it's at night while I'm in bed, he gets on the dresser and pushes off my jewelry boxes and alarm clocks.  He's broken dozens of sets of mini-blinds - either knocks them right down, breaks the slats, whatever.  I've resorted to buying $75.00 roller shades.<br>
<br>
This isn't the worst, though.  He's started urinating where he shouldn't --- like on a brand new sofa, and any blanket that is lying about.  He <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>only</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> does it where me or my husband are likely to spend time, though.  Oh, and the sofa is a micro-fiber that isn't machine washable... yay.<br>
<br>
All of this stops, the minute he gets a flavor of wet food he's in the &quot;mood&quot; for.  And yes, it's a mood.  Right now he might like tuna flavor, but it may be unacceptable to him tomorrow.<br>
<br>
Does anyone have any suggestions to curbing this behavior?  I've tried using Felaway, and that seemed to work for a while - but it's like he's developed an immunity to it.<br>
<br>
Also, if you could recommend something that <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>eliminates</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> (not just covers up) the odor, that would be great too.  Everyone else says they can't smell it, but I can.<br>
<br>
<br>

Ok, that is just *ucked up of your Mom to do that.. *giggle*..  What did she do?  Feed him a bunch of wet food or none at all and he is now punishing you for leaving him with that mean ol' person... how could you? <br>
<br>
I know this is mean but I do one of two things when my cat has gotten picky in the past.  First I just take away wet food for maybe a week.  A week is about as long as it takes.  I still feed her dry.. and soon she gives up and excepts her temped fate.  At that very moment, I then give her wet food, more than I usually do and she gets so happy that she forgets why she started her revenge in the first place and goes back to being the sweet little booger that I know her to be. (And then the next day I go back to what I usually was feeding her) <br>
<br>
If this doesn't help, then I start to cut back on how much dry she gets...but I think I only have had to do that a couple of times <!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-size:xx-small;">(and ..no,  I an't starving the damn thing, She is over 13 pounds, she can do with out a full meal every now and then.. )</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> She refuses to eat ANYTHING that comes out of the refrigerator.  My kitten is different and eats anything.. He could care less.  He would probably eat cardboard if you chopped it up into little bits and put it in his bowl. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://linarya.topcities.com/ayra.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

<br>
i'd have to suggest maybe crating the kitty till he learns that that is NOT ACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOR. hey- i have a big ole crate you can have if you are close :P (got it for the big dog we had.) that way, the cat is not urinating all over, but it's not cruel either. <br>
<br>
i also know there's some really good stuff that takes out the smell of cat urine, and now i can't think of what it is. i THINK it might be resolve, in a red spray bottle, in the carpet cleaner aisle, but not absolutely positive.<br>

There is a book I have at home all about cat behavior and psychology.  That may sounds strange to some, but cats, especially house cats, can suffer from a multitude of psycological or behavorial problems; most of them similiar or the exact same conditions that humans experience. Let me look into it for you tonight and we'll see if we can't begin to understand the reason for his behavior.  <br>
<br>
Where some may see a cat being impossible or downright evil, others may see a cat that has either a health problem or acting in response to something that triggered a particular mental condition.  I'm just happy that you want to stick with him and work to understand why he's acting in this manner and what you can do to help him.  Most owners with cats that &quot;misbehave&quot; simply skip to giving up on their cat and giving him away or euthanizing.<br>
<br>
As far as the carpet goes, go to a veterinary clinic or look online for a product called <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Equalizer.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  It's amazing stuff and really works wonders.  It's so good that it's even used by commercial cleaning companies to remove stains and odors from carpets or floors.  Just follow the directions on the back of the can and go from there.  I fell in love with the stuff while working at a clinic in Oregon.  We had a dog urinate on our white, tile floor in the reception area.  By the time any of us realized he had done it, the urine had stained the tile, leaving a yellow mark after mopping up the mess.  I got out the Equalizer, sprayed the spot, and watched the stain melt away like it was watercolor.  I loved that product ever since.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.mywhimsy.com/boards/dvicons/emcheerful.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Again, let me look at the book tonight and see what I can find out.  Is this cat indoors only?  Has anything else changed other than you being gone for an extended amount of time and being fed canned food?  <br>
<br>
Edit: Almost forgot to ask....Is Sonny neutered?<br>

When he first started doing this, I did take him to the vet - and he had a bladder infection.  They thought maybe that was the cause.  He's been treated for that, and apparently that wasn't it.<br>
<br>
I've also read that changes in environment can spawn this sort of behavior, but there's been no significant changes around here.  Sometimes I just seriously think he's the offspring of Satan and my mother taught him how to act like it.  The only change I can think of is that our female cat got spayed last year, but that's not something I can reverse - so I'm hoping that's not the issue.<br>
<br>
Luckily, his misbehavior hasn't stained anything - it's just that I can still smell it once I've cleaned it up.  I've tried baking soda, Oust, Felaway, Febreze... I will try the Resolve, as long as it's safe for my sofa.  <br>
<br>
As far as not wanting to get rid of him, well... it's not even an option.  I've had Sunny for so long, and this cat has literally been my best friend when it felt like the rest of the world was against me.  I love him like no other.  I've kicked men to the curb because of the way they've treated him, seriously.  But I will say that lately he's been getting tough to deal with.  I won't resort to getting rid of him in any way, but the crate is starting to sound like a good idea.  My mom suggested that, btw - how's that for irony?

I got a hand held steam cleaner (works wonderfully), and have my can of Equalizer (a must have, if you ask me).  Also, look into getting an enzymatic cleanser if you want.  I've heard they work well, but I still love Equalizer too much to change. Enzymatic odor/stain removers can be found in any pet supply store (Petsmart), and Equalizer can be bought over the counter at your veterinary clinic or online.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the added info on Sunny (sorry I mispelled is name earlier).  I wrote down all the facts and I will do some studying tonight.  Hopefully, we can get you an idea of what's the prob or where to begin looking for solutions.<br>

2) Use the light to detect any Urine and use N.M acording to directions to remove Urine.<br>
<br>
3)- just a suggestion here.....<br>
 2-3 weeks is what is should normaly take to break a bad habbit in an animal if you are consistant.  You could confine mr kitty to a room/area ect that is throughouly catproofed (such as a bathroom) and Feed him ONLY dry food untill he has &quot;forgotten&quot; about this whole wet food thing.<br>
<br>
Now he may cry and whine and scratch and you may feel like the worstist kitty mommy in the world but 2-3 weeks of this may be worth it if it can restore peace.<br>
<br>
No one wants to go through life saying &quot;my cat is an asshole&quot; <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://members.hometown.aol.com/drusilabloodmoon/myhomepage/dru01.jpg " style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

I glanced through a book written by Dr. Nicholas Dodman, a professor of behavioral pharmacology at Tufts School of Veterinary Medicine.  The book is called <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">The Cat Who Cried for Help</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->, and has given me some pretty interesting insight into the emotional side of cats.  <br>
<br>
Unfortunately, I was able to find little without re-reading the whole book again.  I did peruse through the chapter about inappropriate elimination, and may have found something of interest.  According to Dr. Dodman, cats who are anxious about something become insecure and feel the need to redefine their territory.  They will do this by urinating in inappropriate places (such as your couch), or even scent marking in other ways; increased head butting on you or furniture, scratching, etc. The problem remains to discover what Sunny would be anxious about.  What has caused him to change?  Was it the time away from you?  Was it the change in diet?  Was it the presence of other cats (while he was staying with your mom)?  <br>
<br>
To begin looking for the source of his behavioral change, go to your vet.  Make sure that Sunny’s problems aren’t medical in nature (i.e. bladder infection).  If after a thorough medical exam you vet finds that Sunny is healthy, discuss the change in behavior with your vet.  Together, you may be able to pinpoint the source of your cat’s anxiety.  If, for some reason, you feel that your vet isn’t really an expert on feline health or behavior, you may want to seek out a veterinarian that specializes in feline medicine.  Almost every city has a “cat clinic” or a “cat and bird clinic” of some sort.  <br>
<br>
I’m not sure if confining the cat will help matters, as it may make him more “stir-crazy” than usual.  However, when I was a child, our cats acted up during the wee hours of the morning.  They would get up on the mantle, knock off pictures and knick knacks, get on counter tops and bite into the bread or anything left out.  They would run full throttle all around the house and up and down the stairs.  They would even climb up above my Mom’s head and drop things on top of her to wake her up when it got close to morning feeding time.  My Mom’s solution was to lock them all up in an unused room when we went to bed every night.  After several months of this, they calmed down and remained civil when the lights went out.  <br>
<br>
Perhaps you can try confining him, maybe during feeding times.  That way, he will understand that this is what he’s got to eat and that’s that.  If he doesn’t like what’s on the menu, he won’t be able to run around the house breaking things or urinating on your furniture.  But, before you begin putting him behind bars, I would definitely have him checked out from a veterinarian and hear what they have to say about the onset of this behavior change and what reason it would happen.<br>
<br>
Sorry I couldn’t be more help.  I wish you the best of luck in determining the problem and working toward a solution.<br>
