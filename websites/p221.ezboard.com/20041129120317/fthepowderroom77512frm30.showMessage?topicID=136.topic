<br>
ARGH... these people do NOT know when to give up!<br>
<br>
Ok, background... we have a cat. He's a nice cat... and we're devoted to him. He is my husband's minion... they're so stuck on each other, it's hard to tell who's worshipping who most of the time.<br>
<br>
Seriously, you ever read those old &quot;a boy and his dog&quot; type stories? Well, this is a boy and his cat. They sit by each other at all times when my husband is home. When he's not, the cat sits by the door waiting. Lightning would probably let Bri cut off his leg if he wanted to.<br>
<br>
They are so close that Brian can clip his claws with a dull pair of mini-nail clippers without restraints... on a 7 year old un-altered tom cat thats never had his nails clipped before and is very &quot;foot shy&quot; in that you can't even pet his feet (unless your name is Brian) without getting hissed at. Sometimes bit if you persist...<br>
<br>
ANYWAYS... when we ended up on the bad side of broke, we managed to find situations for all our pets except this cat. Nobody could take him even for a few months.<br>
<br>
First, we asked his parents (who we would be staying with) if we could keep the cat... naturally they said no. We expected that... after all, these are the same people who took his dog (when he was all of FIVE) that reports say he was just as devoted to (and according to a home video I recently saw, the feeling was mutual) and had it put down because it was &quot;too much trouble&quot; to move with him. In secret while Bri was at daycare. And then LIED and said that Andy &quot;ran away because he didn't like you anymore&quot;. After they moved, they then said they lied... they gave it to a friend to take care of until they were settled... then they further deepened his emotional wounding by saying &quot;oh, he died of a broken heart&quot;...<br>
<br>
Trust me, these are evil evil people... Brian is emotionally scarred for life and it's been almost 25 years.<br>
<br>
ANYWAYS... then we asked for a mere $30, for a downpayment to the boarding kennel... and they turned us down again.<br>
<br>
Flashforward a few months, we got an apartment, got our cat back (we did manage to get him into a kennel) and all was right with the world.<br>
<br>
Then they convinced our apartment manager (they were co-signers) to let them into the apartment... and they tried to STEAL our cat and take him and have him put down. Because we were &quot;wasting money on that thing and it's not appropriate&quot;... &lt;rolls eyes&gt;<br>
<br>
Well, I did mention the cat is a 7 year old unaltered tom cat right? And... he's never had another owner (well, he stayed with my parents for a few years, but that's another story and we did go over there alot so as far as the cat is concerned, he's never had another owner). He's also very very people shy... and he's never been &quot;manhandled&quot; so to speak.<br>
<br>
They tried to go under the bed (which is Lightnings &quot;private space&quot; so to speak... it's where he goes when he's been bad and wants to sulk after punishment, where he goes to hide, where he takes all his toys if we aren't careful, etc... his &quot;den&quot; so to speak) and drag him out.<br>
<br>
By his tail.<br>
<br>
Did I mention Lightning is rather territorial because we've always respected his right to a private place except in emergencies? I won't even go into his den space unless it truely is an emergency of a life threatening nature and Bri isn't home... <br>
<br>
So. Two total strangers invade his den... and then grab him by the tail and try to pull him out. He reacted predictably, and they needed stitches. Literally...<br>
<br>
&lt;sigh&gt;<br>
<br>
ANYWAYS... that brings us to todays issue.<br>
<br>
His mother, recently, has been sucking up, and apparently neglected to tell his father.<br>
<br>
Who apparently decided to call the humane society because &quot;we're abusing that poor helpless cat, it never has food, it's a bag of bones&quot; etc etc etc.<br>
<br>
Note that if it means we don't eat, that cat gets food. Same thing for shots... cat needs, cat gets. Period end of discussion.<br>
<br>
So I just got a nice visit from the humane society... &lt;sigh&gt; Well, they left about an hour ago (after I had to invade the den and drag out poor Lightning to show them that not only is there an almost full bag of food, clean litter box, shot records, plenty of toys, and a full water dish, but the cat is healthy as hell, has no signs of physical torture/abuse, and isn't afraid of me) apologizing for the intrusion and told me that it was an anonymous tip. They even gave Lightning a brand new fuzzy mouse and a bag of cat treats hehe.<br>
<br>
I figured they got the apartment wrong, since we ourselves have called them about an abused dog recently (like the day before)... anyways... his father just called and was GLOATING about us getting our cat taken away.<br>
<br>
GLOATING.<br>
<br>
&lt;snarl&gt;<br>
<br>
WHY do people do these things? What business is it of his if we have a cat? Sure, it means some paychecks we don't eat because we have to buy Lightning food or take him to the vet for a checkup or shots or whatever... but that is OUR DAMN BUSINESS. Not his fathers.<br>
<br>
&lt;mutter&gt;<br>
<br>
Ok, I have vented. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://hostmysig.com/data/ladyneeva/82545.php"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END-->Hamsters are Furry<br>

<br>
Sounds like the parents themselves could be called on for animal abuse. At the very least I would give them a call and tell them that if they didn't leave the cat alone, you'd get a restraining order against them, co-signer or not. :P<br>
<br>
There are very few people I have no tolerance for, and people who abuse their position as parents, bosses, whatever are among those groups. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://saygoodbye.hypermart.net/laranossig.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#B4C8DA><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub238.ezboard.com/bthepowderroom77512.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kulaniautumnwood>Kulani Autumnwood</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_purplespot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lil' Miss Weird<br>is Wonderful</span><br>  Posts: 21<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/11/03 9:56 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p221.ezboard.com/fthepowderroom77512frm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=136.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Evil parents in law and my cat</span><hr size=1> It's really getting on towards tempting to get a restraining order or something... on the one hand, having them pulling these stunts is lowering my already low tolerance.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, this one was just plain stupid, and it WAS rather amusing seeing his mother doing a frankenstein impression. Good thing she was wearing glasses of some sort... judging by the way the stitches (and now fading scars) go, he had pretty good aim &lt;evil grin&gt;<br>
<br>
Seriously, his mother is apparently trying to &quot;bury the hatchet&quot; so to speak now... this is probably all his fathers doing. Trust me, those two's relationship makes my younger sisters relationships look GOOD by comparison. Which is downright scary.<br>
<br>
Hmm... wonder if he actually had the common sense to call it in anonymous, or if San Diego/El Cajon do the same thing Denver used to for those types of complaints... get the complainers name/phone/addy etc and just SAY it was anonymous.<br>
<br>
If they do... and he actually told the truth... bet animal control is NOT very amused with him right now.<br>
<br>
At least Lightning got a fun fuzzy mouse which he has been carrying around for over 14 hours now... heh. It is one soggy mouse. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://hostmysig.com/data/ladyneeva/82545.php"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END-->Hamsters are Furry<br>

Since the call wasn't about a situation that could in any sense be called legitimate (if anything Lightning is on the opposite end of the spectrum from starving lately... gotta put that furball on a diet, he's getting a little chunky lol) they're planning on &quot;checking into it&quot;.<br>

I did call the phone company and have them do the thingie that I can never remember the name of, where they keep a record of a phone call in case it's inquired about and then called animal control, told them what had been said, and told them to call the phone company at this number and ask about record number whatever it was.<br>
<br>
&lt;shrug&gt; Normally, I wouldn't bother going to any sort of lengths, but I am REALLY getting tired of this. REALLY tired.<br>
<br>
Course, Lightning is STILL CARRYING that dang mouse... we're going on three days here... he sleeps with the dang thing. Seeing as he sleeps in bed with us... more than once I've rolled over onto soggy mouseness. Eww!<br>
<br>
Funny thing is... when we had multiple cats back in Denver... one of them (not lightning) LOVED fuzzy mice. But he always ignored them totally... &lt;shrug&gt;<br>
<br>
In other Lightning based news... He's really really cute. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.mywhimsy.com/boards/dvicons/smlybigsmile.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://hostmysig.com/data/ladyneeva/82545.php"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END-->Hamsters are Furry<br>

Fortunately, at this point theres no way for them to physically get to the cat (if they'd be stupid enough to try) and animal control apparently doesn't think a 7 year old 13lb cat with 30lbs of food, a water glass (he won't drink from a disk), and toys is mistreated.<br>
