I have been sick since the end of November last year (03), In and out of the hospital and back and forth to Doctors, I had 2 surgerys and I am still not 100% well- I still have issues I need to work out with the doctors and I know my insurance is comming to a screaching halt this comming december. I also have about 5K worth of medical bills we cant pay and the companys are harassing me.<br>
<br>
My husband and I are both on dissability and trying to raise our 9 yo son who has AS (an autistic specrtum Disorder). We are Fighting the school System to get him some in school help and trying to get in to see theripists and drs for testing. of course that are located an hour away from our home.<br>
<br>
My husband works part time durring the summer months and has had more than a dificult time finding anything durring the winter, jobs now are scarce and most places when given the choice want to hire young people without disabilitys.<br>
<br>
Our car is a peice of crap and literaly falling to peices before our eyes.<br>
<br>
We are constantly broke and yet do not qualify for any state assistance because we &quot;make too much money&quot;. so money is incredably tight.<br>
<br>
Our living situation is insane, the trailer is in my MIL's name, because she insisted that we buy a mobile home when we moved here (to be close and take care of her after her divorse) rather than rent for a couple years and try for a VA loan later- we pay the morgage on the trailer &amp; land but our interest is 17.8 % !!!!!!!!<br>
we have been BEGGING her to refinance for 4 years especialy when the rated had dropped! She Never did anything about it despite the presure from us when rates dropped to like 4.5%<br>
<br>
When I got sick and had to spend tons of money on special foods and on medications my husbands mother (my MIL) talked to My husband and she offered to help pay 200.00 on our 800.00 month morgage, without which we would have had to move into a shelter or somthing. <br>
Simply put we couldnt afford all that medication and &quot;special&quot; diet on top of grocerys, clothing and other normal living expences.<br>
As it was the 200.00 per month went to pills and food.<br>
<br>
<br>
today I go to visit my MIL &amp; she starts screaming and crying at me and verbaly assaults me because she got a bill from the land company stating that we are behind in payments since December!! <br>
She says she did not know that she was suposed to be paying the bill!!!!!! (B.S)<br>
She OFFERED to pay it we never asked it was her fucking Idea!!!! I got called every name in the book and accused of being a selfish bitch and worse, of exploiting her ECT ECT.....<br>
She was angry that *I* had ruined her credit, OMFG.... we are going to be fucking homeless and she is screaming about her credit report???<br>
<br>
(this is the woman that asked me to go with her to pick out 1K worth of new Chairs for her living room the week we almost had the elect turned off and were struggeling to make grocerys streach till the end of the month)<br>
<br>
I am so depressed and so angry!!!<br>
WTF are we going to do and WHY is she blaming ME!! I was so sick and she and DH worked out all of this while I was in the MFing hospital, why is she screaming at ME instead of talking to her son!?<br>
<br>
<br>
I hope I dont internalize this but DAYUM its hard not to when I am treeted this way- I feel like it &quot;must&quot; be my fault, its my fault because I got sick or somthing WTF I dont know but I feel SHITTY!!~!~!~<br>

I'm in the process right now, and it's frustrating, but worth it. If not you, or your husband, your son should be eligible for it, but I would think that all three of you are eligible for it. Not that it would solve all of your problems, obviously, but it would take some of the financial burden off of you.<br>
<br>
Being sick is the hardest thing to deal with, IMO. It costs so much, and you have so little energy to deal with it. Remember that it cannot be helped; don't ever let anyone make you feel bad about it. It is beyond your control.<br>
<br>
I really don't know what else to say. This isn't your fault. I don't think you are in the wrong. At all. And, most of all, I'm sorry that you have to deal with all of this crap. I do know what it feels to be overwhelmed with negative things. When it rains, it pours. I can only keep you in my thoughts, and tell you that you will get through this. I hope things start to look up.<br>

Having been in a similar situation (both husband &amp; I were off work due to disabilities) I can empathize with you - it's a stressful situation to be in.<br>
<br>
First off, I would say talk to your husband about his mother.  No matter how mad she is, she should not be talking to you (her son's wife) like that.  He should talk to his mother about how he would expect you to be treated.  I can understand her being upset over her credit rating; however, if the loan was in her name it was her responsibility to make sure payments are kept up to date.  If she is claiming she didn't know she was behind (regardless of whatever payment arrangement her &amp; your husband worked out) it was still her responsibility to keep track of her finances.  Now might be a good time for her to refinance the home.  She can combine the delinquent amount into the refinanced amount and possibly lower payments if the interest rates are lower and if the principal has gone down some.  Might be worth checking into?<br>
<br>
I am not familiar with financial / medical aid etc in the States, but speaking as someone who has had experience from the creditor end of things - talk to your creditors.  *Most* of them will be willing to work an alternate payment method out with you while things are tight.  Remember, they want their money, and they are most likely to accept getting it a little slower over not getting it at all.<br>
<br>
If you just wanted to vent, and didn't want any advice, I apologize.  Sometimes just venting is enough to make a person feel better <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.mywhimsy.com/boards/dvicons/emcheerful.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

We have it now but ONLY because I was in and out of the hospital so much, the only way we can qualify for it is to show proof of unpaid medical bills in an ammount equal to or exceeding 2K.  Then you qualify for 12 months of assistance (no they do not pay off the unpaid medical bills) after 12 months You have to Requalify with 2K of <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">NEW</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> unpaid medical bills, so basicly you are just digging a never ending financial hole.  when I complained to the Department that that was stupif they suggest I &quot;make up&quot; an illness and go to the hospital or Drs to intentionaly run up bills to qualify (uaaa can you say Fraud?!)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I did speek to Dh and he is Mad mad mad..He will be talking to his mom this week after he cools off, he thinks she is getting Alstimers (sp?).<br>
She has in the past Refused to refinance, refused to talk about selling to the one person who was interetsted in buying and Refused to Rent the place out when it was suggested.<br>
 She just doesnt want to &quot;do&quot; anything!!!! Its maddening. Because of the high payments (since she never did refinance) we were paying 800.00 per month- DH only brings in 1200.00 per month in the winter time and an extra 250.00 per month in the summer (if that) so things are always TIGHT. <br>
<br>
the Idea of moving here was to help us get back on our feet after our bankrupcy (10 years ago now) and after we had all the medical problems Diagnosed (which were the cause of needing to file chap 7 in the first place) Well we are worse off than when we arrived and it is so frusterating.<br>
<br>
<br>
Dh and I have discussed checking into VA loans and buying on our own and leaving the whole mess to his mom, and letting her figure out what to do with it because she has not done anything we suggested in the past. We may have to put all our stuff in storage and camp in a tent over the summer to get ahead but we will do what we have to KWIM?<br>

<br>
My aunt likes to let things go to shit on purpose, so that she can garner sympathy from anyone and everyone who will listen to her. I don't know if that's the case, but if it is, then you know what you have to do.<br>
<br>
I refuse to indulge people like that, as I'm sure you do, because they're impossible to reason with. I think you guys striking out on your own will be very hard, but very worth it in the end. Nobody will be able to hold anything over your head, your credit will get a lot better, and you'll be happier.<br>
<br>
If you don't mind me asking, are either of you in any condition to do office work of some sort? I know it's a shot in the dark, but oftentimes larger corporations (who claim not to discriminate based on disability) such as WalMart, Target, etc. will have jobs that don't require a lot of physical movement, and you would be eligible for CHEAP benefits after a year. I worked for Target, and I paid $32.00 a month for medical, $8.00 a month for dental. If you think you have the energy for something like that, either one of you, it might be a good one to look into. There's also a lot of advancement opportunity in those jobs, so it could be a way to help you out in the future. Just a thought.<br>
<br>
Oh, and as far as TennCare is concerned, they can suck a nut. I applied as medically eligible, but I &quot;make too much money,&quot; so it doesn't matter that I can't qualify for regular insurance and can't afford pre-existing insurance. Life is easier for the rich and for the dirt poor, I tell you. But you already knew that. If they told you to fake an illness, that's a little scary. A lot scary, actually. Keep the faith, though. Easier said than done, but better in the long run.<br>

I won't go into my own experiance because it by far is no where near your's but I garauntee that if you cut that line NOW while there is some hope of salvaging some kind of good feelings down the line it will be better in the long run.<br>
Other than saying I know how you feel with the MIL thing, I can't offer much other than to say you'll be in my prayers, Sweetie. When things pile up it feels like you'll never get out, but it sounds like you have a good head on your shoulders and if y'all can figure out a way to disconnect yourself financially from your MIL things will work out (slowly and perhaps a bit painfully, but they will work out). Keep your chin up and know that there are a lot of people who are wishing the absolute best for you and yours. *HUGS* <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#9AB3CA><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://p221.ezboard.com/bthepowderroom77512.showUserPublicProfile?gid=drusila>Drusila</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://hometown.aol.com/drusilabloodmoon/myhomepage/image3.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span class=glowtitle> Lil' Miss Secret Recipe</span></span><br>  Posts: 815<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/21/04 12:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p221.ezboard.com/fthepowderroom77512frm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=360.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://publish.hometown.aol.com/drusilabloodmoon/myhomepage/drusbird1.jpg width=113 height=133></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.mywhimsy.com/boards/dvicons/whack.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: RANT</span><hr size=1> and things keep gett ign better and better-<br>
