<br>
Two days ago I gave leadership of my guild to my husband on a temporary basis. Why? Because I felt myself burning out. <br>
<br>
*mind you this is a rant so I may ramble*<br>
<br>
I have a section on our board for raid requests or requests in help for stuff. Yet get annoyed when they ask in guild can we go do X when if you hit alt G you can see folks are already doing things. Are we just supposed to drop everything and go running? Now, if I'm not doing anything important, maybe I'll send a few key folks tells and see if they're up for it but more often than not I refer them to the board and the raid request section and then have them grumbling the rest of the night. GAH! <br>
<br>
&quot;Well I can't get a group so I'm just going to log. Maybe if I could get a GUILD group I'd stick around.&quot;<br>
<br>
/GRRRRRR.<br>
<br>
You're 55 and we've been doing LDoN all day. We're all 65...you need A. 3 levels to group with 65 and B. A SPOT! Geez. Is it my job to make sure folks get groups? No!  I've seen it more than once, folks grumbling and bitching that they can't get a group and when I look at the guild roster there is a second group of folks if someone would just take the lead. <br>
<br>
So we go to Fear and drop the demis for some shaman epic parts. We get an amulet of necropotence. We as a guild decide to sell the toy and use the cash to buy some folks upgrades. One person decided that he wanted it...mind he wasn't there when it dropped. Bitched at me for 2 hours. I was beyond pissed and ended up logging. <br>
<br>
My co guild leader went on a tear and told me he was quitting. /blink. Why? Just when we're starting to move forward again you decide your going to leave. Joy. So...one of my guild mates talks him down (he sat there hurling verbal abuse at me for 3 hours, then ignored me till later). When I decided I was burnt and turned the guild over to my husband he gets PISSED (the co guild leader). Should have been him. Uh...right the guy who the night before was quitting, hurling verbal abuse at me and acting like he'd lost his mind. Sorry, I don't think so. <br>
<br>
And when did I become the guild psychiatrist? I don't mind listening to folks if they had a bad day once in a while but I have one that WHINES all the damn time. It's constant. Usually while I'm in the middle of an LDoN with psychokitty (friend of mine who is a vah shir warrior )<br>
I'm either playing my cleric (trying to keep everyone healed ) or my chanter *look at the pretty lights...see the pretty lights* <br>
/type response to whineass.<br>
Your mezz has broken. You're getting slapped around. Ooops, pally had to lay hands but it has mobs attention. <br>
/receive whiny response. <br>
/count to 10...repeatedly to keep from making pithy comment. <br>
<br>
So I suggest she go join guild group in *ZONE X*. <br>
That doesn't happen for whatever reason. Can I scream now?<br>
<br>
These are just a few examples of things that have driven me to tears more than once. I log on and the tells start. <br>
When we going to get Epic piece X. <br>
When are you going to request it?<br>
<br>
I can't find a group. <br>
/sigh. Ok, what would you like to do?<br>
I don't know.<br>
GAH.<br>
<br>
I don't mind simple questions. <br>
Is item X bought, dropped or made.<br>
Easy question, quick answer, able to continue on about my business. <br>
<br>
They have a co guild leader. Hell we gave them class leaders. <br>
*class leader someone who plays a class to a level that most others can't, know the class inside and out and can quote chapter and verse in their sleep. Basically they've reached 60+ and know what they're doing and advise lower levels on spells, equippment, soloing (if its possible), epic advice etc. <br>
But they're still constantly coming to me. Middle of a raid asking me about Epic X. (if its not my class I'm like Talk to Class Leader_01) I have two classes, cleric and chanter. I know nothing about the necro epic, or alchemy or the best weapon for a rogue or....GAH! I'm trying to heal here. <br>
<br>
Anyway, sorry for rambling but I just needed to get some of this off my chest. <br>
<br>
Thanks for listening. <br>
<br>

You try to do the best you can..but never seems to be enough.  People forget that you are there to enjoy the game as well and that it can be difficult if some don't do for themselves.  It is great for them to feel they are able to go to you..but come on..do things for yourself (meaning them)..it is a greater accomplishment. Leaders are burnt out way to fast that way.<br>
<br>
I feel for you..I really do. I think your choice of making hubby your replacement for the time being was wise.  The co-leader should have thought about how he treated you before even thinking of blasting about not being given the title of leader.  Sounds like he does not involve himself (I could be wrong) in the helping of running the guild anyway.  He should be offering to take some of the flack for  you.  My opinion anyway.<br>
<br>
I hope things work out for you and that you can start playing and enjoying it again.  Take care! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#9AB3CA><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://p221.ezboard.com/bthepowderroom77512.showUserPublicProfile?gid=titanyawolfdancer>Titanya Wolfdancer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>TPR Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 18<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/29/04 10:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p221.ezboard.com/fthepowderroom77512frm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=380.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: /rant on</span><hr size=1> Thank you. <br>
