<br>
So Im on this guild raid last night. Charok for royals. We killed the prince and were moving forwards when some complete putz decided it would be funny to train the king and his friends over our heads, then FD. So....<br>
In the meantime I have a friend of mine and an aquaintance show up at my door. They get let in and their sitting at the kitchen table. Now, my guild has a rule baring death (preferably your own, fire, flood or other natural disaster or bad SO faction you do not leave during a CR its just...rude *having to leave for work counts...most of the time*). So I wait till CR is done and log off, wander into the kitchen. <br>
So I fix myself some coffee and sit down. My friend asks me what took so long. So I'm explaining it to her and watch her eyes slowly glaze over. (Hey, if you didn't want to know, don't ask). <br>
Apparently before she left the house she'd called to see if I was home. Made a snide comment about yeah she's home, she's playing EverCrack. Well DUH. You know I play EQ. Forgive me if I don't have time for drama. <br>
So that's what she wanted. To cause some drama. I wont bore you with the details, suffice it to say that it seems there's a plot afoot to get me mad at another friend of mine who happens to be male. After the initial shock wore off and I talked to a different friend, I started to put 2 and 2 together and I came up with 5 (large values of 2 you see). <br>
I'm calm now and realize that I just can't deal with the drama anymore. If she craves drama in her life fine, so be it but don't drag me into it anymore. I can't be bothered and DON'T bust my chops about EQ. You can't understand it fine, don't play.<br>

If 'they' don't play, and they refuse to even try it, they seem even less likely to try and understand. I don't even try and explain anymore. I tell it like it is (ie. I'll be done in 2 to 3 hours or whatever the case may be) and leave it for them to digest. If they can't accept I have a hobby - like some other people play golf - then they don't have to knock on my door anymore. <p><center><img border=0 src="http://members.optusnet.com.au/mishl/desiree.gif" /><br>Desiree CharmSinger<br><br>

<br>
I think the main issue is that EQ is a hobby....a very time intensivve one. People who don't play these types of games don't understand that. I mean, when you play golf you may be gone for about 2 or 3 hours. When you play EQ, you will prolly be on at *least* two or three hours.<br>
<br>
I was thinking about this the other day. Back when I played EQ, no other hobby in my life took the amount of time 'it' did. Sure, it's cheap entertainment, but in many ways you are paying to play an even higher price than you might expect. How? Well, most of us only have one computer in the house. I have two, but even if I were to invite someone else to play, there is a steep learning curve. EQ is not really a hobby that others can 'help' you with (unless they want to play maid and fetch a drink =P) and if they call a couple of hours before they come over, they do feel ostrasized by your back facing them while at the 'puter.<br>
<br>
Now if they are coming over to just cause drama and don't bother to call well in advance (usually after you warn them that you are busy), then F'em.<br>

I'm not so rude as to make them look at my back if they've called well in advance and I know someone is coming over. She had actually wanted me to come over there (I told her I'm sorry I'm in the middle of a raid here). And then showed up unannounced. Hello, I'm dealing with something here and you're just going to have to hold your horses. <br>
She tells me I have no life. (*coughs politely at this*) Hmmm, am I the one running around trying to fix everyone else? No, I'm sitting here quietly at my computer playing my game (or hobby as Desiree calls it) and trying to mind my own business. <br>
No, I'm not a social butterfly but then I never really have been. I don't like crowds, I don't get into the bar/club scene and I'm fairly shy real life (though to meet me in game you'd never believe this). <br>
I've been in Washington state for 2 years now and I don't know alot of people. Yes, Ok I don't go out much. And? I don't drink, I don't do drugs, I don't go out and cause trouble. I'm not violent. Ugh, just leave me alone already with the &quot;addict&quot; comments. <br>
Anyway, I need to scoot for now. I have to deal with some things real life. Talk to ya'll later. <br>

I was talking to a friend, she said she had plans. I log into everquest and start helping a eq friend get flagged. ok gonna be 3 hours or so.  ...said friend comes over and is upset that I won't &quot;just turn the game off&quot;.<br>
<br>
Next day my daughter, calls asks what I am doing, I say I'm going to a raid.   My son and daughter come to visit anyway, and get upset with me because I am at a raid and not paying attention to them. ( my kids are adults)<br>
<br>
Soooo....... friend/family gets on my case about playing eq, and I agree to give it up for a week.  Ok good and fine, will spend lotsa time with kids/friends.  Wrong!  <br>
<br>
My kids have full lives and friends and such and have to cancel on me. I understand, and i want them to enjoy life.  Friend cancels same deal.  But in the end.. I still live alone and when i am home... I 'd rather be playing eq than watching tv.<br>

Then, I also have friends that I actually got to play EQ. Or that already played it when I met them, or that got me to play. Have quite a few of them, so I guess I'm lucky.<br>
<br>
The best thing, however is that my BF just started playing eq. And when we don't see eachother, we play together. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.mywhimsy.com/boards/dvicons/emcheerful.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>~Karry</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#B4C8DA><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://p221.ezboard.com/bthepowderroom77512.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nnod>Nnod</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_greenspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Divine Debutante</span><br>  Posts: 442<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/31/04 8:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p221.ezboard.com/fthepowderroom77512frm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=384.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://strike9.com/file.aspx/path=/Nnod/fullsize/nnodmug.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Is it just me or...</span><hr size=1> A lot of people will put down what they do not understand. It's not just EQ. Happens in lots of different ways. EQ is just one example. People like that need to push off. A real friend should be supportive. Even if they don't like EQ, they should be cool that you do it, because it is something you enjoy.  <p><!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END-->~Sir Nnod Fleshripper~<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=104896">Tug my tail</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

(I am not a gamer at all)  Well last year we got another computer so I could have one and a friend of his was giving up an account she didnt use anymore.  Needless to say he had me create a toon to &quot;see&quot; why he liked to spend so much time sitting in front of a machine.  That was 65 levels ago and I now have Kiome and Aendoritha.  Luckily there is quite a few people in our little town that play EQ and they are the majority of our friends.  But our non-EQ friends...LOL they dont get it.  But they will spend hours on messenger chatting...or in chat rooms...or playing card games on the PC...but you know I have no life cause I play a &quot;game&quot; /sigh<br>

I can quit anytime I want.  hehe <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :smokin --><img src=http://www.mywhimsy.com/boards/dvicons/cig.gif ALT=":smokin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
