His just finished reading the letter he had recieved the night before.  It was from his beloved wife, Fenwyn.<br>
<br>
&quot;My love,<br>
I have finished with the things I was called away do to, and I now am free to return to you.  Meet me at our place under the stars tomorrow eve, let us join together once again in the love that we both share for each other.<br>
<br>
I look forward to being in your embrace again.<br>
<br>
-Fenwyn&quot;<br>
<br>
His violet eyes smoldered as a voice spoke within.  &quot;She be mine!  Ye cannot have her ye vile thing.&quot;<br>
Angrily he whispered out &quot;Begone you, she is not yours.  I am her master.  She will do what I say, and she will obey me.  If only I could kill you...&quot; his voice spoke dripping with hate.<br>
<br>
Again the voice cried out in his head, &quot;Ye cannot, fer without me, ye would not exist.  Ferget that not dark elf.  That woman needin love and tenderness, not yer foul ways. Not yo..&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;SILENCE!&quot; Hakkin shouted out, standing up, a feral look upon his face.  He stood there breathing heavy, his eyes closed.<br>
<br>
He felt lips press against his, and the scent of the woman he had married filled his sense of smell, the taste of her lips upon his made his heart jump..then grow cold.<br>
<br>
A lamented sigh was heard in his mind as his eyes opened.  Fenwyn, drew back, sensing something was not quite right.<br>
<br>
&quot;Love..?&quot; she reached out to caress his face.  <br>
<br>
&quot;I am your Master, Fenwyn.  Or have you forgotten that in your time away from me?  Did the dwarf give you too much tenderness and make you weak?&quot;  He sneered, reached out and struck her with the back of his hand, dropping her to her knees.  All Fenwyn could do was look at him in shock as he stared down at her.  It would quickly be replaced by the non-expressive face that she wore for so long after her time as a captive of the Shadow Guard.  Her head bowed, but a single tear rolled down her cheek.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have displeased you my Master..&quot; her monotone voice replied, yet with a hint of sadness.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, you come here looking for affection that is no longer here.  You gave your life to me, it is mine to control Fenwyn.  You came here having forgot that.  I am glad to see that your...conditioning is still in tact at least.  That stupid pitiful dwarf did much to corrupt it.  Your time with that..family of yours had done much to corrupt it as well.  You belong to the Tier'dal...to me!<br>
<br>
&quot;We have a new family now Fenwyn.  I shed the noble dwarf's ideas as well as shed his family for a new one, a new life.  You will follow me there.  It is not a request, do you understand me?&quot;<br>
<br>
The words filled with hatred and venom pounded her ears, her mind.  Her conditioning kept her from outwardly crying, but inside Fenwyn felt as if she had just died.  The one person that loved her more than anything else in this world seemed to have died as well, and in his place a monster, one out of her past, now directing her future.  Yet, the conditioning kept her from doing anything but obey him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, Master.  I understand.&quot; <p><br>

His head was throbbing, the light seared into his mind, causing him to cry out.  <br>
<br>
After a few moments, the pain subsided in his head.  He blinked his eyes open, unsure of his surroundings.  He was in a small room, on the floor, next to a bed.  His clothing and armor were scattered about, furniture overturned.  There were a few flasks that were empty strewn about as well.  Then it all came back to him.  He was in Thurgardin.  He was in the room that Fenwyn and he had shared many of their intimate moments with each other.  A brief smile touched his lips..then he remembered.<br>
<br>
He struck her.  Rather..his body struck her as he could only watch sadly, crying out for the evil one to stop.  His beloved Fenwyn.  Seeing her in such a way, seeing her succumb to the dark elf broke his heart.  Feeling his body strike her, fighting as hard as he could, but not able to win.  His Fenwyn.  <br>
<br>
Hakkin the dwarf's eyes shed their tears freely, his head now in his hands.  How could he have ever let this happen.  How could he have allowed the dark elf to take over?  His Fenwyn.  How could she ever forgive him.<br>
<br>
&quot;You weak, pathetic being,&quot; the dark voice hissed in his mind, bringing with it pain.  &quot;No wonder I win so easily.  You have turned into nothing but a drunkard, a weak willed nobody.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Shut up,&quot; Hakkin the dwarf said, but it was a weak attempt.  All he could see was Fenwyn's face, the pain and the hurt in her eyes.  The dark elf knew this, and kept replaying it over in his mind, laughing.  <br>
<br>
Hakkin the dwarf stood up, staggered over to his bags, muttering, then finding what he was looking for.  He pulled the cork from the bottle, then tipped it back, draining it.  <br>
<br>
Soon, his mind became numb, then blackness, the laughter echoing into the darkness... <p><br>

Those were such happy times, in the past.  Them huddled together in the warmth of the skins after a gruelling day in their campaign against the giants.  <br>
<br>
She tried not to notice the dwarven inkeeper sighing and shaking his head at her as she brought up food and drink for her beloved.  <br>
<br>
How she loathed the look that the Coldain in the inn gave her, it was a look of disappointment, sadness...and pity.  Pity because no doubt they saw how dejected she was, but perhaps the walls were thinner than she thought.  She had tried not to cry out, but it seemed that even as she tried to keep silent, the master was spurred even more to make her do so.<br>
<br>
She paused at the door, trembling in a disgusting mix of fear, yearning and anticipation.  Then, for a moment, she thought that she heard Hakkin, the dwarf's voice, and her hopes jumped.  Perhaps..perhaps he had returned!<br>
<br>
Quickly, she opened the door, her smile and hopes exhultant, just in time to see the shimmer of the magics that would remove the dwarf that she loved and held so dear, to be replaced by the cruel dark elf visage that she feared. <br>
<br>
The figure was laughing as he tipped another bottle of liqour into his mouth; beckoning her to enter.<br>

The dark elf was lean and muscular.  He wore plate armor, dyed dark red, like drying blood.  He carried upon his back a large sword, well oiled, yet showing signs of use.  He had just returned to Neriak from the Oasis, a message beckoned him to.<br>
<br>
He strode into the empty room, removing his helm, laying it on the table at the center of the room, then stood, waiting.<br>
<br>
Valeria strode into the room, wearing a sheer, practically see through robe, some ornate lace undergarments beneath it.  Dark elves were a vain, seductive race, and Valeria was no exception to the rule.  The dark elf male upon seeing her kneeled to one knee, bowing his head low, his forehead touching the ground.<br>
<br>
&quot;Mistress...&quot;he said, but not a hint of respect could be heard within his monotone voice.<br>
<br>
Valeria looked down, her eyes flashing angrily yet amused.  She would have him, no matter how hard he fought.  She was madly in love with him, and his constant spurning of her only pushed her further into the madness of love.  She reached down and grabbed his hair in her hand, pulling him up, kissing him deeply, biting into his lip.  He growled at her as she pulled away, her tongue running seductively over her lips, tasting his blood upon them.  He sneered at her, and touched his now swelling lower lip.<br>
<br>
&quot;Curse you woman...&quot; he started.  Valeria immediately slapped him harshly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Silence!  You know better than to treat me that way!&quot; Valeria snapped back at him.  The dark elf male turned his face back to look at her, spitting blood out on the floor at her feet.  She chose to ignore his latest sign of disrespect, and stepped over to a stand by the bed.  She opened a container, pouring the liquid out into a glass, then turned to him, taking a small sip of it.  His back was to her, and she smiled slightly.  She then placed the glass back on the stand, and picked up another object.  Valeria looked down at it, then back over to the male that would defy her.  <br>
<br>
A sharp crack could be heard beyond the door, and the scream of unexpected pain came in unison to it.  The dark elf male lay on the floor, a blackened burn mark now upon his armor.  Valeria set the object back town, then lightly walked over to the man she desired.  She looked down at him, slowly shaking her head, sighing.  If only he would give himself to her, she would not have to treat him this way, she thought.  A moan escaped from the male, slowly coming back to consiousness.  She walked over and tugged on a rope, then waited.<br>
<br>
Soon, there was a knock at the door.  Valeria opened it, and ordered the servants to strip the male, then drag him over to the wall.  There they stood him up, his head lolling about semi-consious.  His hands were placed in shackles, and then he was let go, hanging limp, the metal of the shackles digging into his skin as his body weight pulled down on his wrists.<br>
<br>
After the servants left, Valeria stood there, looking at him bemused.  She would have him, she thought, yes, he will be hers.<br>
<br>
The dark elf male slowly came back to consiousness.  He groaned as the pain arrested his senses.  His back burned, his wrists were stinging, the muscles straining in them, almost tearing.  His lip was still throbbing, but it was the least of the things that hurt.  He opened his eyes, and his predicament slowly came to a realization in his mind.  His eyes furrowed in anger and hate.<br>
<br>
He lifted his head up to glare at her.  She started to approach him, seductively, desire in her eyes.  <br>
<br>
&quot;You will pay for this...&quot; he hissed.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  The Present</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Her image changed to his eyes.  Her skin paled, her hair from flowing white mane to a golden one.  Her eyes remained blue, but now went from eyes that belonged to a woman that was in power to the ones that had sadness in them...regret, fear, hate, love...hope.  Her body moved seductively, but not because of a desire to, but because it had been trained to.  <br>
<br>
She approached him, yet he could still see her..still see Valeria approaching him.  It had to be her he thought. An evil grin spread over his face.  Yes, she would pay.  She would pay dearly for all the pain she caused  him, for the eternity of death and life she condemned him to.<br>
<br>
She would pay.  He was now the Master.<br>
