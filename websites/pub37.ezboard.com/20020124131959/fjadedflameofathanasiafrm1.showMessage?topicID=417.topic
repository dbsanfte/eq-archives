I've never had a character as high as Zenimer, who is 46 atm. So to all the higher level friends I’ve made, I’m honored and glad to know all of you. <br>
<br>
We've all had hard times, and great times.  Its how the game works, I always wanted to be high level, but it wasn’t a must.  I've spent a long time in low levels helping out all the new players who crossed my path, and also I helped friends.  <br>
<br>
We all have different priorities for the game and that’s fine with me. I expect it, if not wonder what people expect out of the game.  I have some myself, and now that Zenimer is a tad bit higher level, more possibilities opened up for me.  The only problem was that I left my best friend in the dust and could only talk to him, when I was wishing we were always grouped up.  <br>
<br>
I recently left the game again, because of the insane rules created by greedy people who think that this game is here for them only, and not for everyone.  I am NOT refereeing to anyone in the guild nor any friends.<br>
<br>
I play many games now to adjust to my trend of always wanting something new till it annoys me.  Either by being bored, tried of listening to people whine and bytch, and other junk that I know I have done before myself. So it’s better for me to just move on to a different game for a bit so I myself don’t get caught up in anything.  <br>
<br>
I have been playing DAoC, AC, AO, and a lot of CS.  (For all information wise that’s Dark Age of Camelot, Asheron’s Call, Anarchy Online, and Counter Strike.)  If there was 1 game I was most interested in and loyal to, it’s still and always will be EverQuest.  I main factor why I wont give up EverQuest is a guild named Athanasia.  <br>
<br>
I was away when Athanasia and Jaded Flame merged, but I came back the day they did.  While it was different for me, and sort of hard, I accepted it and always considered Jaded Flame of Athanasia my home, and my family of friends on the game. <br>
<br>
1 by 1 I saw the Athanasia member walk away, and never come back.  I saw many more just up and leave the game, and then the others like myself who don’t have the time, effort or knowledge of uber items who stayed low level, who always burnt out trying to make everyone happy. <br>
<br>
I talked to Dueval some few week before DAoC came out and at that time I meet a few new people in a Different guild.  The way he talked, told me his plans on the future of the guild, made it sound like home again. He was trying so hard but not many were around to give his hopes a future.   In my own way, this my way of saying that I am sorry I was 1 who wasn’t around to help out, because I left EverQuest when DAoC came out. <br>
<br>
I’m going to stop there for now, I’ll be on EverQuest more now, as I have SoL on order and waiting to play it.   If anyone wants to talk, just email me at Zenimer@earthlink.net<br>
