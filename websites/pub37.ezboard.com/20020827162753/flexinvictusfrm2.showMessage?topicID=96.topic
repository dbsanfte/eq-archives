Though it was her native home, it never felt that way among the god-worshiping lambs that were her dark brethren. She liked looking down on them from her perch, listening to their shouts to sell their meager wares of snake fangs and spider silks. She smiled, fondly remembering how greedily she had clutched to her first bag of copper, excited to buy the food that would keep her frail body alive. Frail as it was, she had managed to grow and like all things, blessed or cursed, she had grown stronger.<br>
<br>
 Below her she saw the young fighters, bragging about their strength and haggling over the price of some small piece of armor or a weapon that would make them a better meatshield than the next young one trying to make their name. They were foolish. Did they not realize they are nothing without it? Strip them down of their fine steel and woven chain and they become weak, as weak as any other. None of them had the mind, the strength of spirit to be of any value outside their own egos. She would relent that a few rose above their metal laden beginnings and became true heroes and leaders like the ones within her guild. But most would never have the courage to stand and face dragons or the walking dead like her brothers and sisters of Lex, and till they could prove they could stand on equal ground as they, the sheep would get nothing more from her except her pity and at times charity, for they did provide amusement.<br>
<br>
Her soft boots barley touched the roof she floated across the air to reach another.  A small scuffle between the newborns was beginning and it was always a good show to see them squabble. In the low times of ones life, a few platinum was enough to bring out the worst in a person.. It was during these times in her own life that she realized she had no place among the others. Not among the battlers (she detested getting her hands dirty) and not among the scholars (she could not bare to lock herself away to the years of study the wizards and magicians endured) and certainly not among the blind followers of faith.   It was in those lost times that she had wandered out to the forest. She thought of the power and death held captive in moss snake’s little fangs as she watched it poison a clumsy warrior. How amazing such a small creature could bring such agonizing death. If a small being like herself could harness such power, what destruction could she wrought? She stared at the snake, hungry for its power, and within a moment the snake approached, but instead of attacking, it hissed its servitude. Her eyes then gleamed with the power at her disposal. She wandered into that night with a new weapon not held nor worn and so began her path as a enchantress. <br>
<br>
Since that day she had grown dedicated to her craft. Always intrigued with the mixing of an enemies thought. It could never be taken lightly. One must discover what will make the warriors scream and the casters cry and twist it with a light finger, till their thoughts and their bodies grew cold. This was both a power and a game to her. One she often played with creature and soul alike.  <br>
<br>
The clashing of swords below brought her back to the present. Smiling at their fumbled attempts to dominate each other, she was glad she had stayed to watch the show <br>
<br>
The accusations flew and onlookers gawked. A young warrior, just beginning to grow in strength, had declared the knight a thief, who had stolen a fine quality skin from a recent bear kill. The knight, dressed sharply, in tailored though bloodied clothes, denied the charges, stating he had merely taken a skin from a kill abandoned and that the warrior only now wanted it, knowing the price it would fetch.  <br>
<br>
Small-minded sheep, did they not know there were plenty of bear in the forest with even lovelier furs?  More still, that there were creatures who carcass could be sold for 5 times the meager amount they now squabbled over. She slipped her hand into a small pocket within her backpack and drew out her small treasure, cherishing the fact that there was yet more in the bank. jewelcraft had been kind to her as of late, as well as the nobles who requested it. <br>
<br>
Silence dominated the air…she lightly stepped off the roof and placed delicate steps in the wind as she drifted over the warriors body, the holes in his back clearly showing the cause of death. And the most honorable knight emptying the corpses pockets, thief that he is.  It was time to go home, she had been dawdling with these petty amusements, but there was only so long she could keep her guild mistress waiting.  Only so long that she could be away before her absence was noticed, she had past that mark three days ago.  She would have surly been noticed by now, how to explain was the question. She could always hide the scars…at least until the clerics rose her once more from the grasp of death. And though her powers of thought were great, her body still did not stand well against the blows of enemies and she fell into the darkness often.  To hide would not be the solution.<br>
<br>
She made her way through the dank corridors and between the empty mind guards, she paid no heed to the glowers, they would not harm her,  yet.  Her tiny feet fell into the same footprints that led her to the guild door so many times before. The worn stone leading her home once more seemed soft and pliable beneath her boots. She arrived abruptly at the door. The worn wood welcoming her home, but it did not know her secret, would it be so inviting in the future?<br>
  <br>
Her hand reached for the door lift, yet passed it and lay itself on the old wood. Splintered and cracked, it seemed like her family.  Small splinters able to pierce her indigo skin, such a pretty blue that seemed to clash with the bright red of the drops that now dripped down her slender fingertips. The wood was strong, and solid, offering protection, shelter, and a place of family. It stood high above her slight frame, bigger than her but as her blood absorbed into the grain, a part of her as well. She bit her lip and pouted, what would she tell them. She backed away from the door…she could not do it. The stone now felt cold and unyielding beneath her. Perhaps the wood and the stone did know, but how?   <br>
Shaking her head to banish the silly thought she noticed the light.  A window poured out the glow of a golden fire, she walked to it, the image held her family. She smiled. The old and new faces she trusted with her life filled the room.<br>
 A blush rose to her face, how could she ever be afraid to share with them…and yet…<br>
<br>
She turned heel and walked away from the structure, trying not to feel that it was watching her.  Walking briskly between the beggars, she found him. His wares filling the air with sweetness. She did not ask him petty questions of price nor ask his meager opinion. She threw down the small bag of coins, (she would have handed it to him but he seemed not the cleanest of folk) and proceeded to fill her bags with the bread and honey, fish rolls and grains. A bottle of mead would lighten sour spirits, wisdom would say. Laden down, it was time to go home at last. After all, one must provide for ones family and the distraction would provide her with time..perhaps.<br>
