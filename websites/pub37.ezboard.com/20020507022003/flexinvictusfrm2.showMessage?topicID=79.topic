It had been a long while since she'd been able to spend so much time in her home city, and this night promised to be interesting, albeit tense and stressful.   A long table was lined with goblets, bottles of wine and imported scallops from the area of abundant exotic shell fish known as Cobalt Scar.  Her commrades in arms, those that had taken seats of councilship in her guild followed her in and all of them, herself included attempted to keep their countenances blandly polite.   Apprehension was still evident in their eyes.  She noticed swatches of material with the Lex Invictus emblem draped over seven chairs, clearly meant for herself and the officers that stood at her side, and motioning quietly to the others, she went to claim her seat.  Others continued to mill about, and while she had taken her seat, she still turned her body enough that she could observe as other leaders walked in, dark elves, trolls, ogre's and iksar alike making their way into the confines of the long hall, taking their seats.  She reflected with a bit of pride as her gaze again swung to the officers accompanying her that each race was represented, thinking idly to herself that she'd one day like to see all classes represented as well.<br><br>As glances caught hers, she received several warm smiles, a few polite nods, and occassional brittle smiles that were perfuntory at best.   This night indeed would be interesting.  Her glance then began to sweep across the table, looking at the different swatches with assorted colors and sigil's, many now taking their seats, making the covered seats that remained empty all the more obvious.  She was too late to stop the sigh of disappointment that escaped her lips as she watched the empty seats with frustration.  The sound attracted a few looks in her direction and most that were able to recognise her frustration seemed to empathise, nodding their heads in agreement, or shrugging their ambivilance.  <br><br>As the first to step forward in creation of the talks between the dark alliance, Exordium's representative Rumlum was deferred to as the person chairing this gathering.  After all were seated, he stood, offered a polite smile and began, &quot;We have much to talk about today friends.&quot;  A soft snicker interrupted the introduction and caused her to glance at the representatives of the guild Fist of Innoruk.  Much controversy had surrounded them of late, and with curiousity she noticed how many sat in defensive positions, their arms crossed at their chests, their chins lifted in defiant pride, as if daring people to cross them.  This time she was able to catch the sigh that was about to escape, instead pressing her lips together and allowing her face to become immobile, a nuetral mask of almost casual indifference, as if she had no clue what brought about this first small interruption.<br><br>The small outburst was quickly covered, as if people were still trying to hold off the conflict that would assuredly have its place within the evenings talks, and the subject of where the dwindling numbers of those loyal to the dark alliance would be able to hunt for the welfare and continued prosperity of their people.  Sebilis was brought up with great amounts of sorrow again and again, and she mused to herself that Sebilis reminded her of a lover once scorned that had eventually moved on, only to yet again be pursued by the one that left her behind.   This though broke the nuetral expression for a moment, making a small smile touch her lips before she again went back to offering with her fellow leadership what she could to attempt to fix this problem.  It was brought up several times that the lack of follow through on these plans seemed to be a rather large issue, and the frustration of the different representatives of the guilds within the alliance became more and more evident.  No real solution seemed to be occurring and as the conversation continued, it began to create a feeling of futility within her. <br><br>When the topic of Sebilis was finally worn out, and when no real solution to the hunting situation was offered other than the grim confines of Chardok or the smoldering tunnels of Nagafens Lair was found, all agreed to move on.   The next topic brought to the table was that of the epic weapon, weapons that showed the mastery of the champions of the wars.  With interest she listened as people spoke of the beast known as Ragefire, something she was told she would one day have to see for herself.   People began stating their claims on why they deserved to be supported in their quest for the epic weapon, and of course bickering followed.  While Lex very much was willing to help others with their epics, they had decided to move one step at a time towards theirs, and had slowly been getting many of their members through the different steps to achieve them.   It would be perhaps a bit of time before they would engage in the bitter arguments that were being thrown across the long table, and one thing she hoped for was that Lex would be able to achieve these symbols of accomplishment without the indignation that she sensed was abundant within the room.   As if sensing her mood, her goblet was filled and placed in front of her, and turned to nod gratefuly at her family, whichever had noticed her body tensing from the stressful conversation.  Their expressions seemed to reflect the same feelings that were barreling through her.<br><br>Eventually this conversation too was worn down, and relief swept through her.  Smaller topics were tossed around at this point, as if the largest topic facing them was being avoided.  Beasts were discussed, strategies, the common and uncommon treasures associated with these areas.  The conversation that needed to happen was  becoming less avoidable as they ran out of other things to speak about.<br><br>Finally one brave, or perhaps resigned leader murmured amidst a silent moment, &quot;What say you, Fist of Innoruk, to the rumors that you shall turn traitor to the dark alliance and embrace the Guild Fireborn as brothers and sisters in arms?&quot;  The room suddenly became almost deathly silent, no more quiet murmurs or movements, only frozen expressions, gazes directed at the council of Fist that sat with them as allies.  The group seemed to be the only ones moving, their bodies taking on extremely defensive positions, so much that she even thought she caught within the corner of her eye one warrior of theirs touching his sword hilt.  A leader within their midst finally answered with a hint of what almost sounded like hatred, &quot;What our guild discusses within guild walls is of no concern to you.  Are you all such rumor mongers that you believe Fist of Innoruk would allow lights in?&quot;  This statement caused a moment of processing to occur within her, and her initial suspicion made her brow furrow as she continued to listen.  <br><br>&quot;We have contributed more than enough to the dark team, how dare you question us?&quot;<br><br>Another leader chimed in logically, &quot;When it means that we should begin fearing that the swords at our backs are not those of allies, but of those that would embrace our enemies, it matters.&quot;<br><br>Silent nods of agreement seemed to sweep through the room, answered by the voice becoming even more sharp, &quot;Our conversations are our own, we answered these rumors a moon ago and stated that they were untrue.  What sort of allies do not trust each others word.&quot;<br><br>Finally she felt compelled to speak out, her voice tired and sad, &quot;You mince words to confuse the spirit of a sentiment with the letter of the sentiment.  I was reminded of a conversation I overheard in the Bazaar.  Fireborn will never be tainted with the crossteaming flag.  Perhaps you think so little of us, or our intellect that we would fall for games played with words to hide an intention.  It seems clear to me that while neither guild will taint their name, it is more than evident that the intention is to create a new guild, hence leaving you free to say that your guild will never allow lights.  You perhaps do not betray the letter of the promise, but you betray the spirit of the promise.  What trust should be offered to those that attempt to play games with words with us?  If my suspicions are correct, you have dealt a rather vile insult to those that would call you allie.  If by some outside chance I am wrong, I offer my most sincere apologies.&quot;<br><br>She met the eyes of the leaders one by one, and did not speak a word more.  In a silence that was deafening and telling, they said naught as well, but the rage in their eyes spoke volumns.<br><br>A sadness filled the room. <p><CENTER><HR WIDTH=250><FONT COLOR="RED" FACE="ARIAL"><B><I>Cute little cup-cake, baked by the devil!</I></B></FONT><BR><img src="http://www.pbbr.com/test/synnsig.jpg"><br><A HREF="http://synnovea.no-frills.net"><font face="ARIAL">Phasmatis ex Machina</font></a><BR><a href="http://pub37.ezboard.com/blexinvictus"><font face="ARIAL">Lex Invictus Bulletin Board</font></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub37.ezboard.com/unanookt.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nanook T</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ph3aR my witty sig</span><br>  Posts: 187<br> <font color=#70DB93>(2/1/02 4:48:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub37.ezboard.com/flexinvictusfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=79.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A Storm Brewing...</span><hr size=1> Well written Boss.
