Was told it could take up to two weeks for the application to be processed, not a problem.  (Also noticed the &quot;hiring freeze&quot; you have in effect)<br><br>----<br>Level 47 DE Wizard<br>poorly equipped (probably high30's low 40's gear mostly) due to an old corpse decay a year ago that I never really financially recovered from)<br>Former Minion and Warlord of Zek.<br><br>To avoid repeating myself in some of my answers, here's a bit of information:  I haven't played the game for about 5 months now.  Guilds have disappeared, and a LOT of old group/guild mates have vanished.  <br><br>1. How did you hear about Lex Invictus?<br><br>Through real life friends I've introduced into the game, some of these people have unfortunately opted for the light side.  Both light and dark friends mutually agree Lex is a good guild (my questions were asked solely about the demeanor of members, not about the uber-ness or PvP ownership)  <br><br>2. What motivated you to apply for Lex Invictus?<br><br>Initially the feedback I'd gotten from my friends, and my immediate response was due to the response I'd gotten from Synnovea in game.  My interest turned to motivation when I checked out the board and read the rules/regulations/faq's here.<br><br>3. Have you been in any other guilds before? If so, which?<br><br>Minions of Zek and Warlords of Zek.  Utalyan was created and I searched out MoZ after researching them around April/May of 2000.  I'd always pictured Utalyan as a loyalist, who'd stick with the guild through thick and thin, but there has just been too much reogranization and attrition for me to personally handle, no matter how I'd envisioned my character.<br><br>4. Do you enjoy role-play being added to the mix of your EQ experience, and if not a role-player yourself, are you respectful of those that do choose to role-play?<br><br>Yes, I do enjoy role-play, although I'd consider myself a passive roleplayer.  I'll answer RP with RP in kind, but I'm certainly not anywhere near hardcore.  I do get to enjoy RP in the way I treat members of the other teams, with an in-character disdain (usually ignoring them completely when they try to communicate, being that they are inferior)<br><br>5. Are you familiar with raid protocol such as timeliness, playing your class for raid activities appropriately, being able to show patience during times of stress, getting to raid locations on your own if need be? What are your general thoughts on raids and how you play a part in them as a class?<br><br>Familiar in the sense that any undertaking involving that much effort deserves the same attention described above.  I'd probably take what I've done the rest of my EQ career (all mid 40's and lower) and simply follow instruction, not take risks with my group, and learn by example from guild/groupmates.  Aside from my occasional venting about how I detest corpse runs that take up half my evening, I'm very laid back and don't take my personal losses out on everyone.  I also refuse to give into the temptation to &quot;go linkdead&quot; or &quot;experience technical difficulties&quot; when there's a party/group wipe.  I don't particularly *enjoy* corpse retrievals, but they're a courtesy I extend to everyone and I expect in kind.<br><br>6. Do you own Velious and Shadows of Luclin, do you have necessary keys in game (sky shrine), jboots, etc.? <br><br>I own all expansions, I possess zero keys and if I ever get a pair of jboots, well, everyone on the server will know it, I swear.  (My escapades in SRO could fill a novel, and I've had the time to write it, but I was busy killing all the mobs in the zone and staring at the clock, and drinking coffee in dangerous quantities)  My lack of tools/access to areas is due my nature, which is to roll around getting experience and exploring new zones without taking away too much of my time on spoiler sites and treating my EQ experience like a job.  I'll get whatever equipment I need to get on my own whenever possible, and take advantage of &quot;lets get everybody keys&quot; opportunities when they arise.<br><br>7. What timezone are you in and when do you usually play?<br><br>Central timezone.  Play hours are usually late night (10pm-6am) although that can vary with raid plans or my job (it's a &quot;flexible schedule&quot; in the sense that I have to be ready to go whenver they feel like flexing my schedule)<br><br>8. How do you see yourself being a proactive part of Lex Invictus?<br><br>Interested in raids just for the sake of raiding.  Interested in PvP gatherings, and I love to incite riots in light zones.  I'm the kinda guy that breaks from an exp group to port guild members to meeting points to raids that I can't even attend.  I'm active on message boards without being a hundred-post-a-day type, and I'm interested in shaping policies with input.<br><br>9. What members of Lex Invictus are you familiar with?<br><br>Not so many.  I see a scarce few that I'd even recognize from old MoZ/WoZ (Octavionn being one).  Pirivan (or any of the three thousand incarnations) is someone I've grouped with now and again at different levels, but there have been some huge gaps in my EQ career (months of inactivity at a time) and so almost all of my long-time group/guildmates are gone.<br><br>10. Are you willing to abide to Loot and Scoot and honorable warfare policies and are you accepting of discipline should you be found breaking these rules?<br><br>I always have abided by these rules.  I don't think you could find a character on either side of the Light/Dark line that could cite an example of me breaking them.<br><br>11. Are you familiar with and willing to abide by to the program that Lex Invictus uses for new recruits, including possibiilty of not gaining loot for 2 weeks when joining the guild?<br><br>Two weeks, hah.  I've waited three years for loot, I'm sure I could wait a little longer than 2 weeks.  I really don't care what loot comes my way, honestly.  Gear is neat, and I'm all happy when I get the stuff, but I'm the guy that has to constantly be reminded by his group to stand up for a minute and get my fair share of coin loot, too.  I figure it'll come my way in good time, and I'm in no hurry to get to the top of some list for some uber stuff.<br><br>12. What are your goals in Everquest, and what priority do you place on each goal?<br><br>PvP fun.  I enjoy PvP immensely, and would probably have retired long ago if I didn't have the chance to take other human beings on in combat.  <br><br>Guild fun.  A decent group of people who can be about all the phat lewtz they want, as long as they're fair about it and it doesn't become the only thing I ever hear from them.  The social aspect of the game is probably the most important.<br><br>PvE fun.  PvE can be entertaining as long as it's mixed up.  I abhor camping the same zone for days and days (unless exp is really rolling, then I don't mind an evening or two).  I'm more interested in just killing/exploring as much as  Ican before I leave EQ for good.<br><br>13. Are you serious about becoming a full member of Lex Invictus or are you applying to multiple guilds?<br><br>This is the only guild I'm applying to until 1)  I die.  or   2) I get rejected.  Whichever comes first.<br><br><br><br>The only other information I'd like to add about myself is that I'm aware I really don't have many interactions with guildmembers or any real &quot;sponsors&quot; to vouch for me.  Aside from my contact with Synn in game and maybe chance meetings with a few members in the guild, I don't have any.  I haven't played in quite some time, and if accepted I'd understand completely if I had to wait out an extended trial run on my membership.  Basically I'm not looking for anything other than a guild that's as free as possible from silliness like looting rights conflicts.  I'm simply not interested in how many runs I need to make to get on table 3403-B I for randoms on items from category C (non ultra rare, sellable non-weapon/armor loot) or something like that.   I want to raid so I can raid something, and maybe get neat stuff in the process, not to uber-out my character.<br><br><br>Anyway, that's it.  Sorry for the excessive rambling at the end.  Any additional questions, just tack them on in reply and I'll answer.<br><br>Utalyan Naharai<br>Wizard and Servant of Innoruuk<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub37.ezboard.com/usynnoveaeq.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SynnoveaEQ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Queen</span><br>  Posts: 291<br> <font color=#70DB93>(2/4/02 2:22:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub37.ezboard.com/flexinvictusfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=81.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.pbbr.com/test/synnsig.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Application to Lex Invictus</span><hr size=1> Thanks a ton for the well thought out application.
