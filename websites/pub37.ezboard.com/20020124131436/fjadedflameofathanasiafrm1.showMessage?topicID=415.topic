No secret I probably would hope to join vae eventualy. Not so much as loot as to be with thana. but thana thinks it's about the loot =p<br><br>Much of the time after a raid I can't get back to gfay and regain guild leadership so I spend it unguilded. But I constantly do a /who jaded to see if anyoen logs in. And at most I see maybe 2 people usuly 1.<br><br>I guess this is an offical good bye letter stating that I will no longer be the leader of jaded flame of athanasia. My reason... there is no JFoA to even lead anymore. I dont have a guild it's just a name over my head. the thing I fear the most. I will pass on leadership in hopes someone can rebuild the guild. and I have my twink bard that I dont even play an officer in the guild.<br><br>Those interested in leadership give me a tell in game or leave a post and I will have my last leadership act decide who is best suited to lead what is left of JFoA.<br><br>Many times I have been given tells asking things to the effect of &quot;you left JFoA???!!&quot;<br><br>and many times I tell them there is nto much of a guild left to leave. and I always get the reply talking about how JFoA used to be a power house and a prommising guild. And we did used to be. But it all started falling down hill with Athanasia, and was slowed down a bit with JFoA. but now I think we are at the bottom of the hill. and I dont have the will to pull us back up. if someone does by all means I dont want JFoA to die. but righ tnow we are on the floor bleeding. =(<br><br>I can't think of anythign else to say. Other than I'm sorry I couldn't live up to my promise and ressurect this guild. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub37.ezboard.com/umirrorshadedaemonangel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mirrorshade Daemonangel</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.strike9.com/eq/Mirrorshade/fullsize/Other/smallpic.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 51<br> <font color=#70db93>(11/25/01 7:44:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub37.ezboard.com/fjadedflameofathanasiafrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=415.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.strike9.com/eq/Mirrorshade/fullsize/Other/mdezpic.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: All Guild Read</span><hr size=1> I too have been thinking of leaving recently.

I will probably stay in until the guild is dissolved, mostly because I have no where else to go.  I will miss JFoA, it was fun, at least for a while. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub37.ezboard.com/ukerialofjf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kerial of JF</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 19<br> <font color=#70db93>(11/27/01 3:34:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub37.ezboard.com/fjadedflameofathanasiafrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=415.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: All Guild Read</span><hr size=1> Dueval .....

I truely appreciate all your dedication and efforts!!<br><br>and to end this post I submit this ::::<br><br>Jaded Flame is a semisecret society with no set base of operations. We are primarily a good-aligned group that is allied with a number of good factions. Our aim is to keep the dangers both of and to civilization at bay, including goblin raids, dragon flights, and any other threat that happens to arrise. We believe in the power of individuals, the balance between the wild and the civilized and the good of all the sentinent races. We are by nature meddlers, and often operate alone or in small groups to achieve our ends. Except when battling long-term foes, it is unimportant to us if our name is connected with our actions. We are an amorphous organization, and as such have no main base of operations. We are guided by three principles which are TRUTH, LOVE, and COURAGE. It is these principles that form the building blocks of our organization.<br><br>We are more of a brother/sisterhood then a guild. All members are good friends and to succeed within our ranks you will have to have that mindset. We are for our brothers and sisters. There is NO place among us for the greedy. To give is better than to receive and in that you will find true enlightenment.<br><br>The light of the Jaded Flame becons to you<br><br>God Bless You all!!!<br><br> <p><P><hr><table><tr><td><br><a/></td><td><center><img src="http://www.animal-lifeline.com/adoptionanimal/animalimages/America.jpg"</img><font color=purple><BR><b>Bova DaGnomie<BR>Level 38 Warden<BR><i>I want you to remember, that no bastard ever won a war by dying for his country.
