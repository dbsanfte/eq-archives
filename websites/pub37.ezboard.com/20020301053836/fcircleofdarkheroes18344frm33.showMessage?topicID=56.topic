Traders of the Haven - Factionquest</span><hr size=1> Um in Shadowhaven optimale Faction zu bekommen und günstige Preise (auch für einen Pferdekauf) kann man folgende Quest machen (ca. 7 mal gemacht = ally).<br>
<br>
Der Zeitaufwand ist beim erstenmal etwas länger. Danach sollte man es innerhalb von 5 Minuten leicht erledigt haben.<br>
<br>
Es sind keine Fights zu machen.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>      1. Teil</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Zu <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>      Trade Commissioner Henry</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> in Shadowhaven gehen.<br>
Er ist in der Nähe der Warriorgilde, oder der Zone nach Paludal.<br>
<br>
Hail, Trade Commisioner Henry.<br>
<br>
Trade Commissioner Henry says 'Hello there, traveler. I don't believe that I have seen you around these parts before- then again, I could have and simply forgotten since there have been so many new faces around here. However, if you are a newcomer to Shadowhaven, please make sure that you [register for trading] in the Haven. Registering with the Traders of the Haven will legitimize you in the eyes of local merchants and customers. <br>
<br>
Say, 'I will register for trading' <br>
<br>
Trade Commissioner Henry says 'It's great that you are interested Ashwith, you will surely be glad you did. I have some simple deliveries that I need completed if you wish to be a registered trader in Shadowhaven. <br>
<br>
Say, 'What deliveries?' <br>
<br>
Trade Commissioner Henry says 'The deliveries are simple enough, I just need you to bring some letters to some merchants of the Haven that are currently working in other locations. Will you [deliver these letters]? <br>
<br>
Say, 'I will deliver these letters' <br>
<br>
Trade Commissioner Henry says 'I surely do appreciate the help, Ashwith- clearly you understand the value of solid relations with the locals. First, I will need you to take this newsletter to Sateal. He is currently on assignment in the Bazaar and has been out of the loop on the happenings of Shadowhaven because of his heavy workload. Bring this to him and then return to me with his sales report. I look forward to seeing you soon. <br>
<br>
Trade Commissioner Henry gibt dir &quot;a Tattered Newsletter&quot;. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>      2. Teil</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Den &quot;a Tattered Newsletter&quot; zu Sateal Deirosap bringen.<br>
Er steht im Bazaar in der Mitte bei den Merchants.<br>
<br>
Sateal Deirosap says 'Ah great, I have been meaning to go and pick one of these up from the Trade Commissioner but I have been very busy with my work. Im sure Henry has been waiting for my sales report so here it is. Please return it to him for me if you could and thanks again! <br>
<br>
You gain experience!! <br>
<br>
Sateal Deirosap gibt dir &quot;a Sales Report&quot;. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>      3.Teil</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Bring den &quot;a Sales Report&quot; zu Trade Commissioner Henry nach Shadowheaven.<br>
<br>
Trade Commissioner Henry says 'Great to see you back so soon Ashwith, you looked like a dependable person from the start. The next thing I need you to do is a bit more dangerous, but by the looks of you I doubt it will be a problem. Go to the Shadowhaven outpost in Fungusgrove and give Thar this book. Thar is a great merchant but I have <br>
seen his sales steadily declining, so I figured this book full of selling tips will help him regain his confidence and help him produce the kinds of numbers I know he is capable of. If his economy report is ready please, bring that back to me when you return. <br>
<br>
You gain party experience!! <br>
<br>
Trade Commissioner Henry gibt dir ein &quot;Book of Sales Secrets&quot;. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>      4. Teil</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Dieses Buch musst du jetzt zu Thar Anton (nicht der aus Tirol) bringen. Er steht in Fungus Grove im Outpost, also dort wo die Merchants sind. Immer links halten dann findet man Ihn ca. in der Mitte des Outposts.<br>
<br>
You say, 'Hail, Thar Anton' <br>
<br>
Thar Anton says 'Hello there traveler. I have many wares for sale so please take a look at what I have. If you think all my goods are junk and wish to buy from someone else though Ill understand. <br>
<br>
Thar Anton says 'I see you have brought a book from the Commissioner. Well I'm not much for reading but I will surely try anything that may increase my sales. Anyways I'm sure you arent that interested in how bad my sales are and would like to be on your way so here you go. <br>
<br>
Your faction standing with Traders of the Haven got better. <br>
Your faction standing with House of Fordel got better. <br>
Your faction standing with House of Midst got better. <br>
Your faction standing with House of Stout got better. <br>
You gain party experience!! <br>
<br>
Thar Anton gibt dir seinen &quot;Economy Report&quot;. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>      5. Teil</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Bringe den &quot;Economy Report&quot; zu Trade Commissioner Henry in Shadowhaven.<br>
<br>
Trade Commissioner Henry says 'Excellent work Ashwith, I knew that you were someone that I could trust to get the job done. The trader's union of Shadowhaven will hear of your solid work ethic. Perhaps a courier job is in your future, I couldn't have expected anyone to make these deliveries as fast as you did! Please take this amulet as a <br>
symbol of your dedication to Shadowhaven's booming economy. While wearing this you are sure to get all the greatest deals from the merchants of the Haven both here and in the bazaar. It was a pleasure meeting, you and thanks for all of your help. <br>
<br>
Your faction standing with Traders of the Haven got better. <br>
Your faction standing with House of Fordel got better. <br>
Your faction standing with House of Midst got better. <br>
Your faction standing with House of Stout got better. <br>

<br>
Nun bekommst du beim erstenmal ein Necklace das die Faction in Shadowhaven anhebt, damit kannst du bei den meisten Merchants dort einkaufen.<br>

Daloran Glimmerblade can be found at approximately 25, 225 in Shadow Haven. <br>
<br>
You say, 'Hail, Daloran Glimmerblade' <br>
<br>
Daloran Glimmerblade says 'Greetings Loramin, I am Lord Daloran Glimmerblade. I reside over the Fordel section of the Haven with my dear Mistala. I have not ever seen you around these parts so I would imagine you are a [newcomer] to our great city. <br>
<br>
You say, 'I am a newcomer' <br>
<br>
Daloran Glimmerblade says 'Excellent Loramin, It's nice to have you here as a guest. I am very proud of all that we have accomplished here and invite you to make yourself at home when you are with us. If you wish to further [prove your allegiance] to the House of Fordel I may have some tasks for you to complete. <br>
<br>
You say, 'I wish to prove my allegiance' <br>
<br>
Daloran Glimmerblade says 'Ah that is excellent to hear Loramin. I believe I have a task that I could entrust you with. I have numerous Gemmed sword hilts that I have yet to attach to a blade. They have all been glowing for quite some time with an [unknown force]. All of my residing magicians and enchanters have been unable to decifer the magics that surround these hilts. <br>
<br>
You say, 'what unknown force' <br>
<br>
Daloran Glimmerblade says 'I wish that I was able to discover this myself. Unfortunately not one person in my quarter possesses such identification powers. However, I do have a [friend] in Katta Castellum that specializes in discovering such magical origins. <br>
<br>
You say, 'who is your friend' <br>
<br>
Daloran Glimmerblade says 'Yaeorat is who I speak of, he is a very trusted and old friend of mine that is a very powerful and skillfull enchanter. Will you bring to him the [Gemmed sword hilt]? I feel that if anyone will be able to identify this it will be Yaeorat. <br>
<br>
You say, 'I will bring him a gemmed sword hilt' <br>
<br>
Daloran Glimmerblade says 'That is great to hear Loramin, here is the hilt. Please go see Yaeorat at once and bring me news about the magic that surrounds this sword hilt good or bad. <br>
<br>
You receive a gemmed sword hilt. <br>
<br>
Yaeorat can be found in Katta Castellum at approximately 90,30. <br>
<br>
You say, 'Hail, Yaeorat' <br>
<br>
Yaeorat says 'Ah hello there stranger. I do not often receive visitors in my workshop, what brings you here today. <br>
<br>
Give the gemmed sword hilt to Yaeorat. <br>
<br>
Yaeorat says 'Ah a Gemmed sword hilt attached with a note from my old friend Daloran. It tis a shame that I have not seen him for such a long time. Being so busy with my work has prevented me from seeing and of my family or friends really. Alas, this hilt has a positive energy eminating from it and not destructive as Daloran feared. Please take this back to him as Im sure he awaits it <br>
<br>
You gain experience!! <br>
<br>
Return to Shadow Haven and give the gemmed sword hilt to Daloran Glimmerblade. <br>
<br>
Daloran Glimmerblade says 'Fantastic work Loramin. It would seem that this hilt is fit to be attached to a blade and distributed amongst my guards. I have many other hilts that I need delivered to Yaeorat should you choose to courier another in the future. Until then good luck to you. <br>

<br>
In the short and stout section of shadow haven there is a dwarf NPC named Hardam Stonegrinder. Speak to him and after a short conversation he will ask you to deliver a box of goods to another NPC named Faeroi in The Bazaar. Faeroi is located along the wall near the zone entrance to Nexus. When you hail him he doesn't mention the quest but give him the box anyway. This results in a minor experience award and two positive faction hits. <br>
<br>
+ House of Stout <br>
+ Traders of the Haven <br>
<br>
Faeroi then gives you a second quest involving a helm he was crafting for Hardam. He asks you to return a Rhino horn to him and says any Rhino horn will do. <br>

druid. Keep following that wall to the corner and hang a left, still following the wall, and follow it up past a City entrance (Sanctus Seru I think). Keep going a little bit past the city to get to loc -1119, +1536 <br>
