For three days they had been following him, for three days they had denied him rest....... for three days his anger had been growing. <br>
       It seemed he was safe for the moment, he had no idea for how long though. The Ranger that was leading the small band was good. They had tracked him though the most difficult terrain the wizard could find. However Xavar didn't need long. Sitting back a bit from the cliffs edge he threw his mind into a meditative state, reaching out with his thoughts he began to summon to him the power of the elements. <br>
Feeling the power flow into his body refreshing his valued mana source, his thoughts began to turn to the enemy that chased him so relentlessly, and how he ended up in the predicament he was currently in.<br>
<br>
      He had been hunting giants in the Rathe Mountains, slaughtering them for the coin they possessed in order to further his research. Giant after giant fell before the awesome power of his spells. It became too easy and the wizard became careless. Killing non stop his greed got the best of him, the heavier his coin pouch became the less attention he payed to his mana resources. Casting spell after spell to the point of exhaustion, he summoned Comets of Ice from the skies to smash his prey with destructive force, torrents of flame leapt from his fingers to engulf the lumbering brutes, leaving nothing but a smoldering corpse. Finally exhausted to the point he could barely stand he stopped. His vision blurred by the need for sleep he collapsed on the side of a mountain hiding as best he could in order to gain some much needed rest. This is when they found him...<br>
         Awakened by a menacing feel of power he sat up in time to barely avoid the raging ball of flame that came hurtling through the darkness. It exploded against a nearby tree setting it ablaze instantly. Shaking the sleep from his head he began to look around for the source of that flame. There on the far side of the valley, stood a high elf beside him was a gnome, and running across the valley coming straight for him was a wood-elf. He quickly realized that even fully rested he would be hard pressed to fight off the trio, as tired as he was, it would be impossible. He took the only choice he had.... activating the magic of his boots he ran. The three followed.<br>
       For three days he ran on through the rocky terrain up mountains and across valleys, hiding where he could to get what rest he could find, the ranger always found him. Spell after spell was thrown at him, balls of flame whistled past singeing his robes. The ground shook beneath his feet as lightning struck the ground all around him. The ranger threw spell after spell against him as well, only the powerful artifacts of magic he carried on him prevented him from being ensnared by these magics, and cut down by the shining blades of the wood elf. On he ran desperately seeking a place to rest in order to regain his magics. Finally after three days he saw a chance. High up on the face of a mountain there was a cliff, overshadowed by a rocky overhang and offering a place hidden from view he began to make his way up. On his way up he noticed that finally fortune had smiled upon him, the mountain face was sheer rock, there was nothing there for the ranger to use to track him...<br>
         Breaking out of his trance he once again peered over the edge, the power of his magics coursing through his blood the flames of his anger heated to an all consuming blaze. They had begun the climb, and were soon to come within range of his spells. Just a little more... Finally... <br>
         Xavar stood his form outlined in the night by an aura of fire. Flames dancing in his eyes as he grinned at his foes,they looked up to see his blazing form above them, he could see the fear in their eyes, the prey had become the hunter, weakened in their efforts to catch him, they exhausted their own mana resources in a futile effort to bring him down. They knew their doom was upon them. Xavar raised his hands and summoned the magics, the power filled him and with a single word, he unleashed it.... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub37.ezboard.com/unanookt.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nanook T</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ph3aR my witty sig</span><br>  Posts: 115<br> <font color=#70DB93>(1/6/02 6:11:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub37.ezboard.com/flexinvictusfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=66.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Nice!</span><hr size=1> You have a talent for description Xav.
