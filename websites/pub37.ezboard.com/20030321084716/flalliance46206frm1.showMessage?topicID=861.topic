[Tue Jul 16 16:32:35 2002] Ainure tells you, 'I am the one who was there this morning (mornign my time) and who told the group what the rule was for that mob. I am not in alliance with any guild on Karana!'<br>
[Tue Jul 16 16:33:05 2002] Ainure tells you, 'The fact is, with a mob like RF, the first group to be there buffed and READY to kill him, and who engages first gets it.'<br>
[Tue Jul 16 16:33:24 2002] You told Ainure, 'as soon as u attack a mob who is attacked, it is KS we were ready'<br>
[Tue Jul 16 16:33:34 2002] Ainure tells you, 'According to what Koidnuef told me.. RF was engaged by your guild, but they were holding it while the rest of your guild got there'<br>

[Tue Jul 16 16:38:50 2002] You told Ainure, 'we camp this crap for 6 days now'<br>
[Tue Jul 16 16:39:42 2002] Ainure tells you, 'Yes, and you also know the rules about camping. Per the rules, the PNP, it is the group that is there and ready to fight and who engages first.. not who was camping the longest.'<br>
[Tue Jul 16 16:39:52 2002] You told Ainure, 'like i told you i have a lots of respect for you you are one of the GM who help me the most'<br>

[Tue Jul 16 16:42:46 2002] Ainure tells you, 'No, I can't do that '<br>
[Tue Jul 16 16:44:39 2002] You told Ainure, 'i know there is a lots of EMail done abt this event, but like i told you, Sumadan is a GM Admin and it will be useless. I really dunno why i should continue to play in a game like this'<br>
[Tue Jul 16 16:45:00 2002] Ainure tells you, 'Tell me, did Sumadan tell he was a GM Admin?'<br>
[Tue Jul 16 16:45:08 2002] You told Ainure, 'nope'<br>
[Tue Jul 16 16:45:14 2002] Ainure tells you, 'Then how do you know this?'<br>

[Tue Jul 16 16:45:37 2002] You told Ainure, 'he is responsible for lost items someone told me'<br>
[Tue Jul 16 16:46:02 2002] Ainure tells you, 'Guides and GM's cannot and will not reveal their Guide or GM identity to a fellow player. If they do they can be fired from there job (for a GM) or removed from the Guide program and their account banned (for a Guide).'<br>

[Tue Jul 16 16:47:48 2002] Ainure tells you, 'I have no idea whether or not a GM Admin has a play character on this server or not. You may think I'm lying, but I am telling you the absolute truth.. and I would imagine taht whoever told you this information is mistaken'<br>

[Tue Jul 16 16:55:07 2002] You told Ainure, 'Sumadan leader of GH'<br>
[Tue Jul 16 16:56:14 2002] Ainure tells you, 'OK.. has anyone talked to any member of GH? I wasn't able to find anyone in your guild who could give me names of GH members who were there.'<br>
[Tue Jul 16 16:56:15 2002] You told Ainure, 'the one i want to talk is the one who made the decision to KS cause i talk to a friend in GH and he told me if you attack first, we will respect that'<br>
[Tue Jul 16 16:56:28 2002] You told Ainure, 'i dunno just logged'<br>
[Tue Jul 16 16:57:39 2002] Ainure tells you, 'OK.. you might want to talk to them. But you need to remember is what the rule is about spawns such as Ragefire.'<br>
[Tue Jul 16 16:58:13 2002] You told Ainure, 'u cant know if we will or not kill a mob if you dont let us try it'<br>
[Tue Jul 16 16:58:49 2002] Ainure tells you, 'I can't do anything about you killing the mob. I can't spawn it'<br>
[Tue Jul 16 16:59:18 2002] You told Ainure, 'yea and for sure we were able to kill it in 5 to 10 min'<br>
[Tue Jul 16 16:59:38 2002] Ainure tells you, 'when the rest of your guild got there, right?'<br>
[Tue Jul 16 16:59:38 2002] You told Ainure, 'all ppl were ready'<br>
[Tue Jul 16 16:59:56 2002] You told Ainure, 'fornt eh human form no'<br>
[Tue Jul 16 17:00:12 2002] You told Ainure, 'the Human form can be kill by 7 ppl'<br>
[Tue Jul 16 17:00:16 2002] Ainure tells you, 'and what happened with the dragon form?'<br>
[Tue Jul 16 17:00:48 2002] You told Ainure, 'during the time the human is kill, it was easy for the rest of the guild to pop'<br>
[Tue Jul 16 17:01:15 2002] Ainure tells you, 'but someone killed the dragon form.. were your people there to do it?'<br>
[Tue Jul 16 17:01:32 2002] You told Ainure, 'there is over 50 ppl who waited here for 5 days sleepind 1 or 2 hours a day for this mob'<br>
[Tue Jul 16 17:01:52 2002] You told Ainure, 'they KS the human so he died too fast'<br>
[Tue Jul 16 17:02:11 2002] Ainure tells you, 'and what happened when the dragon form spawned.. did you have the numbers there then?'<br>
[Tue Jul 16 17:02:35 2002] You told Ainure, 'no cause they KSed the human and he died too fast for the rest of us to pop'<br>
[Tue Jul 16 17:03:10 2002] Ainure tells you, 'see.. that is the entire issue right there. Yes, I know you had people there for 5 days or 6 days or a year! But.. you didn't have the numbers there to kill it. That is the entire issue.'<br>
[Tue Jul 16 17:04:39 2002] You told Ainure, 'we had the ppl to kill it. They KSed the Human so no time for us to be call. When the guy who was supposed to call (chain call) saw GH KS, he paniced'<br>
[Tue Jul 16 17:06:02 2002] Ainure tells you, 'Cirano.. I know you're frustrated and angry. But the point is, you have to have the numbers there ready to kill both forms - and you have to engage it first. From what you are saying this did not happen.'<br>
[Tue Jul 16 17:06:03 2002] You told Ainure, 'there is no limit of time to kill a mob i hope?'<br>
[Tue Jul 16 17:06:36 2002] Ainure tells you, 'No, other than the game limit.. but you cannot engage either mob and wait for the rest of your players to get there.'<br>
[Tue Jul 16 17:07:36 2002] You told Ainure, 'we were able to kill Human form for 100% sure if it take 5 min to kill him, at least 20 ppl more were there to fight the Dragon so around 27 and some more a bit after this is more than enough for RF'<br>
[Tue Jul 16 17:08:14 2002] Ainure tells you, 'No, you aren't understanding what I'm saying. But I've repeated this over and over and over again. I have also noted it in my report, and your guild has written. That's all I can do'<br>
[Tue Jul 16 17:08:59 2002] You told Ainure, 'thats fine but for me and 50 ppl and a tons more, it is KS there is a coalition on Karana against GH now'<br>
[Tue Jul 16 17:09:42 2002] Ainure tells you, 'That's fine.. I have no control over that'<br>
