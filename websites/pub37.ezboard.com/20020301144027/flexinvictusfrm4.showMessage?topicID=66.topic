How did you hear about Lex Invictus?<br><br>I forget how I heard about it the first time, lets face it, you guys have been around for a while.<br><br>2. What motivated you to apply to Lex Invictus?<br><br>I don't know.  God help me, I just don't know.<br><br>3.  Have you been in any other guilds before?<br><br>I was guildless until level 27, when I joined Black Tomorrow.  Eventually I became the second highest level, and most frequently online member of that guild.  It was hard to admit, but in the long run they were bogging me down, as all I did with them involved me, and powerlevelling someone.  After I saw most of those someone's quit, I pretty much gave up with powerlevelling.  I was never actually the leader of the guild, as I don't like that kind of responsibility, so eventually I left for El Dia de la Muerte.  I'm sure several of you know of the infamous Tucc, and Toee.  They pretty much ran that guild.  I was in that guild from 40 or so to 44 or so, the biggest thing I did there was level.  We then merged with Pahojen Kilta.  Tucc and Toee went off to join pandemonium, which put a dent in the people I usually play with, but still I stayed with Pahojen Kilta becuase I had friends in the guild, and thought crossteaming wrong.  I stayed in PK for a long time, but always felt fairly worthless with the likes of Kuda and Bullen going to every raid I went to.  I remember the days of taking away their level 60 haste with my level 52 one, and then being told not to do that, of claritying people and not having it stick, of mezzing something, and then being resisted and having one of the other ench's mez it.  In the end, I just went to raids to talk, and didn't feel I contributed very much.  I made a switch of servers to Drinal for a while, got my ench on there Splatt Masterson to 40 in 9 days of /played time, and then started up a monk on tallon named Revil.  It's really sick how much easier it is to level a melee than an enchanter.  He was up to 40 in 9 days played, and I'd never played a monk before in my life.  I pk'ed a lot in those 9 days too.  Now he's just sort of a twink for when I'm bored.  Anyways, he brought me back to tallon, I joined The Forsaken Legion with Revil eventually, and eventually found myself bringing Reval along on their raids, so I guilded Reval with them.  But there was trouble brewing for them, as they had an influx of ex pandas, which didn't cause me to leave, as a lot of them were old friends.  I'll make it plane and simple that I don't hate them for crossteaming.  I don't like the fact that they're against me now, but it's a game.  If a friend of mine in real life brings along a few new friends that I've never met before and they all beat me in a game of basketball, I don't begrudge my old friend for it, although I might if the new friends are truly bad people, but that's hard to judge.  Any ways, after that guild lost most of Tucc's friends back into el dia de la muerte (reformed), I left for Eternal Darkness because FL wasn't doing any raiding that month.  Literally.  The goal objective was to level up, and that I did, but levelling for a month is quite boring.  I got 54 with them though, which was nice.  Also, I'd known a few people in ED for a long time, such as Jaige, Neyphlite/Daiken, and Crawz (but he was retired then).  I stayed with Eternal Darkness until they merged with Nox Noctis to make Exordium.  I left Exordium because in December I was just wandering around lfg for most of my playtime.  The only thing it seemed that I got to do with my group were a few of the raids, which of course weren't going on all the time.  At the time I thought I'd join Pandemonium, but it wasn't a very planned out thought.  In the end a lot of little things like seeing Chasrn in action for pande vs. a friend, and my own lack of motivation to hurt the dark team made me change my mind.  In the end, the only real crossteaming I did was grouping with mostly dark groups of pande/others in old sebilis.  I never oor anythinged on anyone, I never talked trash about the dark team, which I still respected (otherwise I wouldn't even be here), and I never went with them on raids.  I did, however, develop an aweful case of embarassing toenail fungus.  I tried going back to Exordium, but as fate would have it, it didn't work out.  So then I applied to Fist of Innoruuk, but they raid from 12 midnight on, and there is no way I could keep up with that, although they really are good people.  I barely saw most of them during my normal play times, so I decided that wasn't the right choice.  I know it probably doesn't fit your standards, but quite frankly right now I'm just drifting from here to there.  <br><br>4. Do you enjoy role-play being added to the mix of your EQ experience, and if not a role-player yourself, are you respectful of those that do choose to role-play?<br><br>I'm pretty easy going about roleplaying usually, I don't take it too seriously, but I don't want to ruin anyone's good time either.<br><br>5. Are you familiar with raid protocol such as timeliness, playing your class for raid activities appropriately, being able to show patience during times of stress, getting to raid locations on your own if need be? What are your general thoughts on raids and how you play a part in them as a class?<br><br>I'm not perfect about times, as sometimes I can't get on, but when I can I make it to raids on or ahead of schedule.  I'm fine with the rest of the questions in that question.  My general thoughts on how to play an enchanter for a raid depend on the raid.  I could type about how I think you should play an enchanter, but I think the only way to answer what this question is really asking involves playing the game.<br><br>6. Do you own Velious and Shadows of Luclin, do you have necessary keys in game (sky shrine), jboots, etc.? <br><br>Yes.<br><br>7. What timezone are you in and when do you usually play?<br><br>Central, I don't play one exact time frame everyday, I'm somewhat flexible with that, but sometimes I just can't make it online at certain times.<br><br>8. How do you see yourself being a proactive part of Lex Invictus?<br><br>I could say anything I want about this one, but I think actions in game speak louder.  I will drink milk and do pushups every day.<br><br>9. What members of Lex Invictus are you familiar with?<br><br>Carcharoth I know fairly well if he's still in the guild, I sort of knew Odecious, I know Synnovea... I bet you're tired of reading this so I'll stop at that.  Daiken scares me.<br><br>10. Are you willing to abide to Loot and Scoot and honorable warfare policies and are you accepting of discipline should you be found breaking these rules?<br><br>I will talk lots of trash and then bind rush people.  When you try to discipline me, I will be arrogant because I am level 60 and know eveything =/.  Honestly though, I don't have a problem with anything in that question.<br><br>11. Are you familiar with and willing to abide by to the program that Lex Invictus uses for new recruits, including possibiilty of not gaining loot for 2 weeks when joining the guild?<br><br>I'm not familar with it, someone will have to tell me in game, I can't find it here.  I don't care about loot.  I give away most of what I earn in loot nowadays, although of course I still have things I want like everyone else.  <br><br>12. What are your goals in Everquest, and what priority do you place on each goal?<br><br>I just want to have fun.<br><br>13. Are you serious about becoming a full member of Lex Invictus or are you applying to multiple guilds? <br><br>I think the Revelation might get my two twinks, so that I can keep in touch with them too.  I'd like to be able to talk to them, maybe help them out when you guys aren't doing much, or when they are trying to do something big.  I'm not trying to be rude by it, but I want to make sure I don't go around lfg forever like I was when I finally snapped and left Exordium.  If full member means officer, believe it or not, the only guild I even got that far into the leadership part was Black Tomorrow.  I'm not one to take too much responsibility in a game.  If I don't join you guys or The Revelation, I plan on making my own guild called &lt;A.F.K.&gt;.  It will consist of me, and whoever else I can get to go in with me (with mules, as I don't want anyone else to really be in the guild, as they'd be at a loss for guild activities..) <p><center><b>Reval Canieval</b><br><i>1337 Stick Figure Artist</i><br><TABLE BORDER=0><TR><TD><A HREF="http://blog.ravenblack.net/quiz/videogame.pl"><IMG BORDER=0 ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=80 SRC="http://blog.ravenblack.net/quiz/videogame/13.png" ALT="What Video Game Character Are You?
