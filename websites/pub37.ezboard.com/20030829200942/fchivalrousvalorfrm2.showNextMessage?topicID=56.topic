<br>
Author: Carnuss <br>
It has come to my attention that many children have been neglected by their<br>
parents since the dawn of the EQ era, so I have taken it upon myself to<br>
replace some of the conventional wisdom that may have been causing so many<br>
tender minds to be snubbed in the past. Below are a few suggestions that I<br>
have chosen to share with those of you who have children, but find that when<br>
you are busy camping for your Ykesha or beating down the doors of Nagafen,<br>
you just can't find time to aid the child in coming to grasps with the world<br>
around them. I have detailed in this document the secrets to discarding the<br>
world, and replacing it with the things most important in all our lives... <br>
<br>
Problem: Child is curious why the sky is blue. <br>
<br>
Solution: Inform the child that it isn't actually blue. It is made up of a<br>
number of different hues that you have been able to maintain in the sky<br>
because of your great video card and you have it set for double layer so<br>
that it looks like clouds move independently. <br>
<br>
Problem: Grandmother dies and child is bereaved. <br>
<br>
Solution: Remind child that Grandma will be back. She just returned to her<br>
bind point, and is likely to be back to loot her body any minute. Make sure<br>
that you ask child if he would like to help Grandma get her exp back before<br>
bed time as well; that generally makes the child feel wanted. <br>
<br>
Problem: Child accidentally drops his gerbil off third floor of your house<br>
after hearing that they were related to the feline family and watches with<br>
dismay as the animal splatters thirty feet below. <br>
<br>
Solution: Congratulate the child and remind it what incredibly good<br>
experience gerbils are at that level. Recommend moving up to another mob<br>
soon though, because gerbils will be turning green soon. <br>
<br>
Problem: Child is horrified by water and he refuses to go to swimming<br>
lessons you have arranged for him. <br>
<br>
Solution: Comfort the child and remind him that many of his best items are<br>
underwater. Assure him that there is nothing to be afraid of since he can<br>
get a fishbone earring with a little patience, and he will certainly need<br>
the swimming speed he can develop with his trainer before he can put that<br>
earring to any real use. <br>
<br>
Problem: Child has acted out in class and has been put into detention for<br>
his actions. <br>
<br>
Solution: Be assuring to the child and suggest that he practice his little<br>
used skills while in detention. 2 hours should be more than enough time to<br>
bring those troublesome trade skills into line. Be sure to provide the child<br>
with some money to purchase any additional equipment that he may need to<br>
pick up while practicing. <br>
<br>
Problem: Child has difficulty in math and appears to be unlikely to pass the<br>
class. <br>
<br>
Solution: Start using mob base levels in the child's teachings. When<br>
multiplying 2 x 50, refer to it as Fire Beetle x Zazamoukh and when the<br>
child replies Excellent as the answer to the question, you have reached your<br>
goal. The child has become better at Math (100)! <br>
<br>
Problem: Child is busted for fighting on school property and you are<br>
contacted to pick the child up. <br>
<br>
Solution: Reprimand the child strongly. Remind the child that if mobs are<br>
allowed to escape they will come back and cause trains. Instead suggest that<br>
next time the child should Snare the mob, kill it, and try to avoid letting<br>
it seek help. With those types of tactics the child should be far more<br>
likely to level quickly. <br>
<br>
Problem: You discover child has been stealing from you. <br>
<br>
Solution: Do not get angry. Try to push the child into a different center of<br>
focus. Rogues are a weak class, but you can't tell a rogue to quit. Have the<br>
child try killing a few things. Buff it a few times to see if it likes the<br>
augmentation role. After a few short rounds of trying any other class, the<br>
child is sure change its behavior immediately. <br>
<br>
Problem: Child is found drinking with friends after school in your back<br>
yard. <br>
<br>
Solution: Purchase more alcohol and join them. You never know when a high<br>
alcohol tolerance is going to be useful. Encourage the child and his friends<br>
to drink liberally and quickly so as to see their skills rise quicker. <br>
<br>
Problem: Child has disappeared and you can't find its equipment. <br>
Solution: Make a new child that looks just like it. Look back with fond<br>
remembrance, but keep in mind, it was just one child and doesn't really<br>
matter in the whole scheme of things since you can have up to 8 on your<br>
account. Make sure the next one you make is a different class. <br>
<br>
*** DISCLAIMER *** <br>
<br>
I am not a parent currently, but I am however friends with a few parents who<br>
have found this advice sound. If you choose to use any of the above methods<br>
of child rearing, be wary that it does tend to cause detachment, painful<br>
urination, law suits, back aches, sterility, and heavy blood loss in some<br>
specimens. Check with your psychiatrist before taking any action described<br>
above. If you do however find that these work for you, be sure to tell two<br>
friends! <br>
