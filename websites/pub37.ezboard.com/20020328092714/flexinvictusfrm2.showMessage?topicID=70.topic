Delicate blue arms, and long silver hair trailed down one side of the trolls body as he carried the limp form towards the encampment which had been erected within the caves leading towards Sirens Grotto.  Consciousness rolled came in short waves for the cleric, her gaze painfully shifting up to look at the countenance of the troll that carried her.  Thoughts scattered, due to a wide array of injuries, but the cleric focused on his face.  Stark determination was evident, as was an abundance of fear and caution.  Idly she wondered of Dazmaz's mixed heritage, his looks not completely troll and his manner of speaking certainly more -- scholarly perhaps was the right word, than the normal troll of the ranks.  Consciousness drifted into darkness....<br><br>Jostling woke her once again, her eyes half opening as she attempted to clear the blurred vision.  She saw another trolls face directly above her, and she realised that the bloodied wounds were being bandaged, as Dekkurrd leaned down to from her perspective check on her health.  This troll she thought to herself was one of supreme competitiveness, though within that competitive nature, she also realised a high level of competence and heart.  She rested easier knowing the two warriors were seeing her safely back to the encampment.  Perhaps she would even live.  She chuckled and then coughed on her own blood at the morbid thought, the strain from it causing the blackness to engulf her again....<br><br>Dreams took her then, images of her large brothers and sisters of the noble races of the trolls and ogres.   Stilled images of them bravely charging in towards beasts, protecting their commrades in a manner that was fiercely loyal, and at times heart wrendingly touching.  They would sacrafice all, their fears being hidden away in some dark, secret place within them if it meant giving confidence to those they had sworn loyalty to.  What noble men and women they were, how lucky the drow were to have them as allies.  In her mind, she painted a picture, to her way of thinking a masterpiece of beauty.  Flashes of faces that the lights would deem ugly seemed to her to be the most beautiful.  Their beauty came from the look in their eyes, and their wide smiles that were so genuine.  Their expressions were so vivid.  Drifting back in to consciousness she again found a face hovering above her, a gentle smile offered within the wide countenance.  Tagu.  He pushed some hair back from her forehead and murmured a few words that caused her to feel a little health return.  She heard him murmur something about moving faster, Cargalia again in the distance.  A shudder swept through her and gratefully she again allowed her weary mind and body to slide into unconsciousness.  <br><br>Her mind rolled over the light races, flashes of visciousness and hatred emblazened in her tableaux.  They did not realise that Innoruuk had already won with them.  In some ways this disappointed her.  She was a heretic to her god, she worshipped greater than he.  She would not utter the words in open spaces, but her evolution and ascension was travelled in the loyalty to another diety.  Innoruuk knew this, but the diety being more powerful than he, was unable to do anything other than seethe and hope that one day his vengeance upon the cleric could be visited.  She worshipped a diety that others often scoffed at as a myth.  She knew from her visions that this diety was no myth, but instead something that was never meant to be tangible to the   common mind, or even the common diety.  It's purpose was one of evolution and in some ways balance.  One of ultimate creation and destruction.  It was darkness and light.  It understood in some unfathomable way that those emotions that drive one to seek a deity are only complete with counter-emotions.  The nameless.  It had visited her, though only through these odd flashes, offering no real direction, but instead a challenge.  Innoruuk often would play havoc in her dreams, malicious and cruel for her disloyalty, but he felt the presence of the nameless as well, and in his fear, and in her own progress, he did not deny her or attempt to interfere with her progress.<br><br>Again her thoughts drifted back to the trolls and ogre's that she felt so bonded to.  The lights would not treat them well, such was their arrogance and fixation on the beautiful.  It always bewildered her how the short races were able to tolerate this prejudice.  She'd seen it and heard it in their battles.  The lights would gladly accept the help of the short races, but they were quick to visit insult and degradation on their allies for their appearance.  Her mind rebelled at the idea of allowing the war to end only to see her brethren suffer such indignnities.  Even the most noble and wise iksar would surely see such prejudice, and this idea left her whimpering in her state of unconsciousness.  Hypocracy was the foundation of the lights war.  Conquer hatred with hatred?  No amount of deaths would ever see that happen, the war was lost to the light races before it ever even began.<br><br>She awoke to warm furs being tucked around her, a familiar huge form hovering in arch the tent that she was being attended to in.  Concern etched his normally stoic features, a gentleness there that touched her heart.  She managed to speak, though her voice was weak, &quot;Oooglie....what brings you here.  If the dragons hear of your visitation they might question your loyalty...&quot;  The large troll waved it off, &quot;We will tell them we were spying.  They aren't too clever when it comes to gauging loyalty Synnovea, you know this...&quot; She nodded.  &quot;So I hear they killed Glati, quite the accomplishment....&quot; She began to remember seeing the majestic dragon crumble, and upon glancing over to the bags that were nestled in the corner she saw it's head.  A small smile creeped upon her face as she whispered, &quot;Ahh Dekkurrd will finally have his frostbringer.&quot;  Oooglie nodded back, a hint of affectionate amusement hiding in the depths of the eyes at the clerics stubborn tenacity.  On a chuckle he offered, &quot;You know this dragon slaying needs to be tempered with some rest, right?&quot;  She nodded again.   The chances were unlikely that she'd allow much rest for herself until she knew that her people were prospering and strong, ready to face the tasks she knew would soon be before them.  &quot;Soon enough we'll be ready to join you in the testing halls, we must be prepared....&quot;  She felt the pull of sleep again tugging at her.  Oooglie, always a perceptive troll walked into the tent and leaned down, brushing a kiss on her forehead.  &quot;Sleep well vicar, I expect you to be alert and ready to share a few spirits with me upon sundown.  Your officers have all well in hand, your wounded are all being tended to and recovering quite rapidly.&quot;  A small smile touched her lips, and a nod was offered that became more of a rolling of her head to the pillow, her eyes again fluttering shut, finding sleep.  Her rest now was peaceful, her people safe, her allies at hand, her friends of the larger races, for now, confident and safe from the prejudices she feared would be their plight if the war was to end. <p><CENTER><HR WIDTH=250><FONT COLOR="RED" FACE="ARIAL"><B><I>Cute little cup-cake, baked by the devil!</I></B></FONT><BR><img src="http://www.pbbr.com/test/synnsig.jpg"><br><A HREF="http://synnovea.no-frills.net"><font face="ARIAL">Phasmatis ex Machina</font></a><BR><a href="http://pub37.ezboard.com/blexinvictus"><font face="ARIAL">Lex Invictus Bulletin Board</font></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub37.ezboard.com/unanookt.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nanook T</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ph3aR my witty sig</span><br>  Posts: 164<br> <font color=#70DB93>(1/24/02 7:18:49 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub37.ezboard.com/flexinvictusfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=70.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Plight of Prejudice</span><hr size=1> Beautiful.
