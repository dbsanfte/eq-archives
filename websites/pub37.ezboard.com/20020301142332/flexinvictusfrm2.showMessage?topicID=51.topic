'A Knight of the Shadows,'  he thought.  'A fitting name for my profession, although i have yet to achieve the actual rank of Knight...'  In the distance, he heard shouts and screams, punctuated with the occasional explosion.  Curious, he hailed a nearby guard.  &quot;What goes on out there, friend?&quot;  he asked, noting the guard's almost condenscending attitude toward him.<br>
<br>
     &quot;Why, tis the younglings bickering amongst themselves, trying to impress the unimpressable watchers, the Lords of Neriak.  If you wish to find favor in the city, it might be wise to go join in the fray.&quot;  The young one swore he could see laughter in the guards eyes, even through his concealing helm.<br>
<br>
     &quot;Bah, must I?&quot;  He shook his head.  &quot;I have no desire to impress anyone with my talents.  I know what I am capable of, and do not need to impress any but the Great Lord himself.  All the same, i do need to work on the fighting skills necessary for advancement in my guild.&quot;  He turned slowly, a look of resignation on his not-quite-delicate features.  The guard paused for a moment, and then hailed the younger elf.<br>
<br>
    &quot;Who are you, youngling, and of what house do you belong?&quot;<br>
<br>
    The younger one paused, and then slowly turned around, his face set in a grimace/smirk that gave the much more experienced guard a chill right down his spine.  &quot;My name, sir, is Shaiith, and as to my house...&quot;  All traces of amusement disappeared, leaving nothing but a mask of pain and hatred.  &quot;I have no house, sir, but the house the Necromancers gave me.&quot;  With that, he turned once more, set his spine straight, and ran off with nary a look back toward the noise and commotion.<br>
<br>
     'No house,' the guard wondered, 'no house and... Shaiith?  Nameless?  What secrets do you hold, young Nameless Knight?'  After a few moments of thought, the guard shrugged at his sentry partner and went back to his vigil.<br>
<br>
     In the distance, a new voice was heard... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub37.ezboard.com/unanookt.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nanook T</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ph3aR my witty sig</span><br>  Posts: 45<br> <font color=#70DB93>(12/4/01 7:34:05 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub37.ezboard.com/flexinvictusfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=51.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fiction that has NOTHING TO DO WITH GRUUZ</span><hr size=1> Nice work Gruuz.

If it hadn't been for the assistance of the other Dark Elves, he would'nt have stood a chance against the angry Kodiak.  He paused for reflection, and thought back to the beginning of the ordeal....<br>
<br>
<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
     Slamming his cheap wooden shield into the rump of the fleeing wolf,  he raised his sword and brought it down in one decisive chop.  Severing a bit of meat from the still twitching corpse, he sighed at the loss of the pelt; he was still missing a decent pair of pants.  The skin of the wolf he had just killed wasn't good enough to even make the patchwork armor he wore on the rest of his body.<br>
<br>
    Sensing something wrong, he spun about, crouching to meet whatever threat approached.  He wasn't ready for what faced him.  There, running at him full tilt, was a young kodiak bear, rare in these woods but deadly to the young ones.  There was only one course available to Shaiith:  he ran.  As fast as he could.<br>
<br>
     He wasn't fast enough.<br>
<br>
     The huge creature overtook him swiftly, missing with the first swipe of its great paw, but catching him decisively with the next one, knocking him to the ground.  Shaiith was forced to lay there, catching his breath.  He kept as still as he could, hoping that his little play-dead game would deter the bear.  Not fooled in the slightest, the bear hooked its claws into the back of his leg and threw him forward.  Luckily for Shaiith, that was the way he had been trying to go.<br>
<br>
     He flew through the air, almost landing on top of the great log that the novice dark elves used as a base.  Screaming for assistance in a very un-Knightlike fashion, he scrambled painfully to his feet and turned to face his foe.  For a brief, terrifying moment, he thought his cries were in vain.  No one heard him!  Then, as a burst of flame enveloped the kodiak's head, he gave thanks to Innoruuk (never more devoutly before!) that he was not alone.<br>
<br>
     A small elemental came at the beast from the side, and another burst of flame impacted on the side opposite.  Another young Dark Elf bearing a sword marginally better than his, and with slightly more skill, was at his side, swinging and dodging.  Behind him he heard, &quot;My Lord Innoruuk, grant this pitiful creature before me respite from his pain!&quot;  The words seemed to ring inside his head, as the latest claw marks on his leg began to close.  Slightly.<br>
<br>
     He snarled, and with all the hatred he could muster, slammed his fist directly into the creature's sensitive nose.  As he connected, he felt a peculiar sensation:  all the hate in his body was being drawn into that one punch.  In an explosion of red light, the bear's head snapped back as if yanked by some Gnomish contraption.  Staggering, the thing turned to run.  Knowing it would come back, but unable to continue farther, Shaiith all but collapsed where he stood.  <br>
<br>
     The young cleric behind him, seeing that he lived and was therefore no longer worth her attention, intoned, &quot;My Lord, assist me now, strike this creature down where it stands!&quot;  Another explosion, nowhere near as powerful, bit at the bear's hindquarters, slowing it down.  Its other pursuers, anxious to skin the creature and take its valuable pelt to sell, redoubled their efforts.  Bursts of flame and the flash of steel followed the creature as it ran.<br>
<br>
     Finally, it fell.  the Dark Elf in the robe, the source of the flame, ran to the carcass and pulled out a small skinning knife.  The warrior that had stood beside Shaiith gave the greedy mage a disgusted look and continued about his own personal business.<br>
<br>
<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
<br>
   Wincing anew as his mind came back to the present,  Shaiith realized that the others had only helped out of ambition.  The Unseen would espy, and see that these young ones were indeed able to work as a team, regardless (or perhaps because of) personal motives.  The Unseen would approve, and grant these little ones with more responsibility, and the chance to go spread their hate into the world.<br>
<br>
     Reaching into the small bag hung on his belt, Shaiith realized another, more important thing:  he was out of bandages.  Sighing, he leaned back up against the log and waited for the long slow process of healing to begin.  He would have no scars, Innoruuk would see to that, but the pain wouldn't go away for a while.  He had plenty of time to reflect.<br>
<br>

Too many people, there had been, and Shaiith was not fond of crowds.  To be honest (and honor demanded honesty, at least to himself), the fighting around the fallen tree was tedious and repetitive, the same young dark elves trying to impress the same elders.  There was no change, there was no relief, there was no holding THIS young dark elf back from exploring any longer.  He wanted to see the lands he would someday conquer.<br>
<br>
     Breathing in the fresh air, he gave a rare smile.  His hair, dyed a light shade of grey, blew gently in the breeze.  The night was calm, and dark for those without gifts such as his.  He almost felt sorry for them, these... humans.  Almost.  the darkness, with barely a sliver of moon to light it, was much brighter than any light he had ever seen before.  It mattered not to him.  His skills and expertise were as such that the Great Lord was almost ready to grant him his spells.  This was good.  More ways he could bring suffering to the races that embraced the light.<br>
<br>
     As if on cue, a movement caught his eye.  Cursing his own ineptitude, the young dark elf quickly cloaked himself in a veil of non-seeing, which allowed him to remain hidden even though an observer might pass but two paces near.  He took in the sight, and chuckled.  A lone elf, a warrior by the look of him, wearing leather armor and carrying a sword that looked a little fine for one so young, even by the elven standards of quality.  This one had friends in high places, and his presence here was probably an initiation of sorts.  It was almost certain he was being watched from afar.  Shaiith quickly gauged his opponent, and found him worthy.  Smiling to himself, he waited for an opportune moment to make his presence known.<br>
<br>
     He didn't have to wait long.  The elf turned and looked behind him, attempting to watch his back and make sure he wasn't taken from behind.  That was never Shaiith's intention.  With a feral grin in place, he dropped the concealing cantrip and chuckled softly.  The effect was instantaneous.<br>
<br>
     The pale one spun around so fast he nearly fell, and snapped into a familiar fighting position.  Shaiith chuckled again, realizing that this was no warrior.  This was what the wood elves called a ranger, a druid who took up the blade.  He studied his opponents features, committing them to memory, wanting to remember what his first kill looked like with his head still intact.  He saw the pale brown hair, eyes the color of the leaves on the trees, and a beautiful face that was now drawn into a tight, pensive expression of wariness.  With a start, Shaiith realized that his opponent was female!  He chuckled again and shrugged.  Male, female, it made no difference to him.  If they wore a sword with the intention to use it, as this one did, then they were dead.  Gender meant little.<br>
<br>
     On the elf's part, as she studied her opponent who had seemingly come out of nowhere, She saw an elven face, but with bluish black skin, and the features were twisted into what could only be called a sneer of contempt.  By human standards, this one was still handsome, but to her aesthetic eye, his face was too course, the eyebrows too thick, the nose too narrow, giving the dark one a predatorial look.  She had no doubts as to what- or who - his prey was.<br>
<br>
     No visible or audible sign was heard, but one moment they stood facing each other, and in the next there was a flash of steel, a loud clash, and muttered curses as the dark figure drew back, holding his arm above the elbow.  Crimson drops stained the burnished bronze armplates as he inspected the wound.  He nodded:  he could still fight.<br>
<br>
     Throwing himself suddenly into a headlong dive at her feet, he rolled with his blade angled slightly out, hoping to at least nick her legs.  The pale one was too quick, and jumped over the hurtling form, performing a frontflip an acrobat would have been proud of.  Coming down lightly, she spun, thrusting her sword at where the shape had been.   It wasn't there, and the tip sunk into the soft earth.  A flurry of movement ahead told her what had happened:  the dark elf hadn't stopped rolling after the initial attack.  Now the tip of his great sword was shooting towards her chest, hoping to remove her heart.  She accepted the worst of the blow, but turned aside.  The resulting wound was painful, but not lethal.  She wasn't done.<br>
<br>
     Feinting a thrust, she quickly stopped just short of her target, switching the maneuver into a downward chop that caught the dark one completely off guard.  The blade passed within inches of his head, scoring deeply into his shoulder.  With surprising speed, he stood and stepped back a pace.  That last attempt had nearly been the end of him.  It was all he could do to maintain a defense against the blows that came fast and furious now.<br>
<br>
     Desperation lent Shaiith strength, but he knew the outcome of this battle.  He would die, his body be left for the scavengers, and anything of value on him would be taken.  Suddenly, he felt the old surge of hatred.  This harmful touch had saved his life in the past, and now he called upon it again.  Throwing every last ounce of strength into his next few blows, he managed to strike the pale one repeatedly, scoring hits on shoulder, chest, and thigh.  Weakened, the elf staggered back out of range of that deadly blade.  Not far enough.<br>
<br>
     Lunging at his opponent as she retreated, the young Knight of shadows let the hatred build, burn, and boil its way through his body.  Focusing the energy as his mentor had taught him, he slammed his fist into the delicate bone structure of the elven wench's face.  The hatred flowed to a focal point in his hand, and with the familiar hissing whine and stench of ozone, the young elven female's face exploded into a fine red mist.  The corpse dropped lifelessly to the soft ground, a small pool of red slowly growing larger around the fallen head.<br>
<br>
     Clutching his wounded shoulder, Shaiith again called the veil of shadows and crumpled next to his fallen foe.  <br>
<br>
     Darkness came.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
PAIN!!<br>
<br>
Agony!  Excruciating, palpitating, throbbing, grinding PAIN!!<br>
<br>
He lived.  How, he had no clue, but he lived.  Faces swam around him, a dark voice whispered...  my lord, help me, your servant, your child... I?  Help another?  Impossible!  ...my lord, please, you know i live only to serve... Impossible i say!  Show yourself, Phantom!<br>
<br>
  At those words, the shadows seemed to coalesce.. a vision he saw, which could not be true... there, lying on the grass next to another body, that of the dead elven bitch!  He gasped, shocked, as he realized that body was his!! <br>
<br>
How is this possible?  How can this be?  The form on the ground stirred slightly... it... HE... was still breathing, albeit slightly.  The phantom voice rang in his head.  ...Lord, please...  It was coming from... the body!  HIS body!!  <br>
<br>
YOU SEE, LITTLE ONE, HOW IMPERFECT AND FRAGILE YOUR EXISTENCE IS TO ONE SUCH AS MYSELF<br>
<br>
My lord?<br>
<br>
YET SOMEHOW YOU THINK TO CALL ME FATHER<br>
THIS AMUSES ME NO END<br>
<br>
My Lord Innoruuk!<br>
<br>
SOME CHOOSE TO NAME ME SUCH<br>
MORE AMUSEMENT FOR ME, I AM ABOVE SUCH NAMING<br>
<br>
Great Lord... what has happened?  Why am i here?<br>
<br>
YOU DO NOT PAY VERY MUCH ATTENTION, MORTAL<br>
<br>
YOU AMUSE ME<br>
<br>
IF I CHOSE YOU WOULD NOW GO TO THE AFTERLIFE...  AND I DO NOT THINK THAT YOU WOULD APPRECIATE WHAT YOU FOUND THERE<br>
<br>
BUT THE AMUSEMENT SUFFICES... YOU BRING DEATH TO THE LIGHT, AND USE THE POWERS I GAVE YOU WISELY<br>
<br>
The darkness coalesced upon the hapless knight once more, and when he awoke, he was standing near the entrance to Neriak, wearing only light clothing.  His.. body?  was in the eastern commonlands, near the ridge between Nektulos forest and Freeport.  It didn't take him long at all to get there, although when he did, he got many strange looks from people.  He didn't understand at first, but then he realized they were seeing a dark elf strip a corpse that looked just like himself, and then putting on the plate armor like it was custom fitted for him.<br>
<br>
As he did, he heard that fearsome voice once more, now only a whisper<br>
<br>
go, my son, go forth and kill, that i may have my revenge upon the gods of light<br>
<br>
i have granted you new powers as well, use them as wisely as you have the ones you already had<br>
<br>
He chuckled to himself... amusement for the Lord?  If that was what the Father wanted from him, then he would give it.  Elves...  Humans... even the diminuitive ones.  They would feel his wrath for his Lord's amusement.  He tried to be a good son.<br>
<br>
He stood, and looked to the night sky.  It was a perfect night to sacrifice to his Lord.  He ran swiftly into the near distance, seeking a new victim.<br>
<br>
In the distance, a cry of pain, and even further away, phantom laughter...<br>

At a dead sprint, he moved.  <br>
He wasn't fast enough.<br>
<br>
The pale imitation of himself he had been chasing ran faster than he had any right to.  The elf stopped briefly, allowing Shaiith to get a bit closer, and muttered something under his breath.  Instantly, the boots he was wearing glowed brightly, and he took off again.<br>
<br>
Curses!  Damn the foul creature!  Where did they get this equipment from?  Inevitibly the wood elves and high elves that came within reach of his blade were somehow hastened, through the use of those damnable boots or the spells they cast or the songs they sang.  One day, he would show them.  He would show them all.<br>
<br>
Maybe what was needed was a visit to their own home, a little greeting from him to them.  He chuckled darkly to himself as he watched the pathetic elf vanish into the evening mist of the commonlands.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, a swarm of insects converged upon him from out of nowhere, biting at him, and attempting to get to the blood beneath the ebon skin.  It was irritating, aggravating, annoying, and it downright bloody pissed him off, but he knew enough to hold his anger down and look around for the source of the pests.<br>
<br>
Not there... not there... THERE! <br>
<br>
The voice in the back of his head screamed at him.  NOW!  STRIKE NOW!<br>
<br>
This was only the second time he had heard it, but so far, it's desires and his were one and the same.  He struck.  Knowing that this scourge of pests would eventually bleed him down a bit, he struck with the lifestealing spell, allowing him a few precious moments of relief before the maddening bugs drained the new blood out as well.  More was called for.  He didn't feel like chasing this one down, so he called upon another of his powers, and the diminuitive figure was surrounded by darkness, slowing his steps.<br>
<br>
Shaiith chuckled even as he ran towards his assailant.  Try to take HIM by surprise, eh?  Fine.  He wondered for a moment what the person on the receiving end of a two-handed sword felt right before it cut into him.  His preoccupation was abruptly cut short, as the roots from the short bushes somehow leaped up out of the ground and wrapped arounnd his legs, fastening him firmly and causing a little bit of pain as well.<br>
<br>
Snarling, no longer even slightly amused, he ripped his way out of the grasping roots and hurtled towards his opponent.  Spells, eh?  Well, two could play that.  <br>
<br>
Pausing for a moment, he caused his mind to be filled with sickness and disease, and directed the sensation mentally towards his foe.  The halfling, for so it was, turned decidedly pale and shook his head as if to clear it.  By that time, Shaiith was upon him.<br>
<br>
Almost shrieking his hate, the dark Knight swung the sword in a large arc, slashing deep into the druid's arm.  The druid staggered back a bit, shook his head again, tested the arm for durability, and pulled from his belt a wicked-looking scimitar.  Shaiith stepped back a pace and began another spell.  This small creature had no need for the strength to use said weapon, at least in his eyes, and he could always use more.<br>
<br>
Upon completion of the spell, the halfling weakened a bit, and Shaiith grinned, feeling the weight of the two handed sword grow less in his hand.<br>
<br>
NOW!  STRIKE NOW!<br>
<br>
Again the voice bellowed in his head.  That, he thought, wasn't really necessary, because that was exactly what he was doing.  Even as he thought, the heavy blade went above his head and came screaming down towards the halfling.<br>
<br>
Obviously knowing little of swordplay, the druid put up his blade to attempt to at least cushion the blow.  The steel of the scimitar was not made to take the kind of force that was being dealt, however, and snapped like a twig under the weight of the heavier blade.  The arm underneath, bracing, didn't fare too well either.  As a matter of fact, it was nearly sheared clean off.<br>
<br>
Realizing suddenly (a little late) that he was not as good a swordsman as the dark one, the druid fell back on something he knew.  Magic.  Muttering, gesturing, and pointing at the dark elf, he began to emanate flames from his fingertips.<br>
<br>
     &quot;I don't think so, my boy,&quot;  Shaiith hissed.  &quot;It must be very hard to concentrate with the hilts of a sword shoved where the sun doesn't shine!&quot;  So saying, he drew back to attack again, the voice inside screaming at him to strike NOW, while he was vulnerable.  &quot;Curse you, be silent, I DO know what i'm doing here!&quot;  The halfling paused.  Who had the Tier'dal been speaking to?  Great Mother, not only was he dangerous, he was quite mad as well!<br>
<br>
The delay cost him.  Dearly.  As he watched the dark elf converse with thin air, he forgot in his untimely interest the fact that there was over a full meter of steel headed directly towards his head.<br>
<br>
At least, until it got there.  After that, he didn't have to worry about anything ever again.<br>
<br>
Shaiith thrust the blade into the soft ground a few times to clean the blood off, knocked off a few loose clods of dirt, and proceded to slice the druid's purse strings.  Nothing.  Such cheap bastards.  If they were going to come attack him, they should really hit up the bank before they came.  All the same, his lesson had been learned.  He would certainly be more attentive in the future.  The last of the swarm departed, leaving the Knight of Shadows alone with his thoughts.<br>
