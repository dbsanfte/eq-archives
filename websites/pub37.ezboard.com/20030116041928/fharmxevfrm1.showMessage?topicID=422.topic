<br>
It will make this post make a little more sense.<br>
<br>
Before you start reading this post know from the beginning i have no intention to flame the guild leader of one of the most powerful guilds in EQ, im just gunna rant for a while seeing its 3:15 am.<br>
<br>
You may not know me because im not some hot wired, zone shouting, cocky i own the world guild leader, or some witty, funny, entertaining, curse word using guild page updater. Yes i do enjoy every second of it when i read a guild webpage and the use of fuck or shit is used to put down homosexuals or unoriginal bastards.  No you will not find me streakin around every General Section of every uber guild to post my stats and brag about the new weapon only i have.  Where u will find me is having fun getting exp not worried because my class isnt able to mez a mob or unable to cast Complete Heal on myself.<br>
<br>
I have played this game long enough to know whats wrong and whats right about a class or a zone or a mob. If something isnt working usually i know why. Being apart of the best guild on a server you know about things before they even happen. Like Thott pointed out, he heard rumors about changes way before they happen. <br>
<br>
Earlier today i was looking around web sites and just browsing around seeing what new fun things have been conquered. I came across a link to one of Thott's explainations as to what a Bard is lacking and why they are so weak and useless whether it be day to day exp or high level raiding.  I found some good points like the new FT (flowing thought) items kinda hurts the use of a bard in a group but honestly how many people other than uber guilds actually have FT items. And moreso even if you actually get a cleric who has FT15 will prolly be greedy enough to want even more mana pumping into them. <br>
<br>
Bards are far from under powered or useless. Sure u compare the fire power of a wizard to a bard. Also as your very complex diagrams pointed out of all the casters, the bard is the class doing the least amount of damage. I only wonder how someone can even compare two totally different classes like a Wizard and a Bard in the first place. One class being solely casters who cant take shit for dmg, therefore to make up for lack of HP or AC must deal insane dmg to maintain there balance in EQ. And the other class being a bard who not only can take damage, but can melee AND cast spells effectively. <br>
<br>
Yet again the Bard was compared to a Cleric.  Clerics shown as being able to heal more HP per second than any other class. Bards being on the bottem of the list sadly. Wait...why so sad ? Please tell me another class who can cast spells, and melee, while healing themselves and there group, while giving everyone more mana ? Hmm none come to mind really.<br>
<br>
Farther on a Bard was compared to other Melee's. I for one have a bard in my guild who can out dmg some groups. I dont wanna hear that bards do shit for melee dmg when i see them pumping that haste song and critting for over 100. Oh and im so sorry that only warriors get defensive discipline, i mean if everyone got defensive then what would be the point of high level encounters ? <br>
<br>
And lastly Bards were compared to Enchanters. An Enchanter having the sole purpose of its excistance to charm, mez, slow, debuff, tash..etc etc. That is what they are and that is what they do. Bards you are a hybrid class, you are able to do a little of everything. I dont expect a level 60 bard to be mezzing named snakes in front of the Emp of Ssra. I dont expect you to be able to Slow a specifically disease slowable mob. <br>
<br>
Now i know alot of people like to sit at there little cubical at work and study everything about EQ and the class they play so that when the time comes they have a valid arguement with a few good points. But honestly of the 4 great bards in my guild, i think the biggest complaint was. WHY THE FUCK ARENT THERE GRAPHICS ON MY BONGO DRUMS. Other than that everything works as it should. <br>
<br>
The last thing i say before i go back to bed ( and yes i woke up, got out of bed and turned on my computer specifically to talk about this ) is you bards are the key piece to most any encounter you can think of. You guys have a little of every class in the game all rolled into one. Maybe you dont lead the pack in any single category, but the fact your in every category must stand for something right? Enchanters only key to survival is there ability to charm or mez things that no one else can. I mean if everyone could do it then enchanters would be fucked. Warriors are there to take all the damage, if everyone got defensive what point would it be to have a warrior on a raid when ur SK or Pally has more AC. Clerics sit there and CH over and over and over and over while u silly bards are up runnin with the melee taking shot for shot. Would u rather have ur ass planted on the ground with mod rods at your feet, facing a wall all night (no offense cleric ). Shamans are there to Malo/Slow/Buff  why do u bards complain when all ur slows dont land... maybe because ur  class prohibits u from slowing a mob that another class was created for ?<br>
<br>
Maybe its not my place to be making this arguement, but forever i hear people complain about their class and how it is underpowered and every other class is over powered. And because i dont post alot on any boards, its all coming out at once. Everquest is a game where every class works together. And it seems alot of you high end guilds  FUCKING LOVE to complain because the new items that drop over powers classes. Be happy a guildmate is getting the weapon so that they may better help the guild.<br>
<br>
Play the game dont fucking live it..<br>

I enjoy the class immensely and wouldn't consider any other class in the game for my main.<br>
<br>
Thotts post, while it comes off as a bit dramatic, simply indicates bugs and flaws that have occured to the bard class. The comparisons to clerics/enchanters aren't direct comparisons regarding healing or damage. He compared the power curve for a cleric/enchanter growing with the new expansion, while a bard has remained WAY below.<br>

<br>
Well, with my atk buffed out my ass, I used to put out a &quot;decent&quot; at best dps. But an equally equipped melee will always outdamage bards under the same conditions. Especially considering we are using a 16/26 ratio weapon offhand, which leads to those 100 point crits, it might look like big numbers, but big numbers do not = big dps all the time.<br>
<br>
Also like to clarify that I do not think I should be doing the majority of melee damage as rogues/monks. But bards are WAY below all other melee in terms of dps, lower even than the standards that we were assigned during the melee damage revamp.<br>
<br>
Everyone thinks their class has problems. Most wizards still complain they can't do enough sustained dps, Rogues are complaining that a Ranger with AM3 can almost do as much damage with his gdamn bow than they can do with the best weapons available full out meleeing.<br>
<br>
If you read the article, Thott is merely suggesting fixes to long existing problems, and small changes to things that have let bards fall behind the guidelines that VERANT themselves set. (melee damage for one)<br>
<br>
I guess what I mean is I don't see what your big issue is. You think he is asking for too much? Too much to add it so we use FT? Too much to ask for immunity fixes so we can snare immune to slow mobs?<br>
<br>
He's not asking for the world, he's asking for us to not be broken.<br>

<br>
unfortunately this game can never be totally balanced.  No matter what they implement or what they nerf there will always be some class that feels as though they have gotten the short end of the stick.  The general layout of the classes in my opinion has remained fairly similar, although they have changed the power of some of the abilities either positive or negative, so the class you chose still basically does what they always did just might not be as effective as you would like it to be.  I would never play another class, even though sometimes I feel warriors have been cheated somewhat as we all feel that way about our classes but in the end my job remains the same, to die many times so other people can do the damage (poke clerics) <p><br>

Balancing apples and oranges will never be easy though.  There are 15 classes, 60 levels for each one, and 3 platforms for each of those..  raiding, soloing, grouping.  Most of the complaints seem to be coming from the people who want to solo but cant.<br>
<br>
My only complaint with being a wizard.. it has nothing to do with me being underpowered or overpowered.. and this might be the same for other classes, but people in xp groups have the general idea that wizards cant keep up with pulls.<br>
<br>
Reason this bugged me was from level 50-59 it was a pain in the ass finding a group, everyone was on the Wizards suck bandwagon... and they were/are probably right.<br>
<br>
but nowl i have mental clarity and casting mastery and those xp groups i used to wait in line for are a joke compared to the xp i get soloing or AEing.<br>

( that is what pisses me off the most).  If VI actually gave a flying fuck about bards we would not see thier songs fucked up every other time serverside code is overhauled. why? CAUSE THEY WOULD FUCKING PLAY TEST THIS SHIT AND MAKE SURE THEY DIDN&quot;T FUCK UP BARDS !!!<br>
<br>
I honestly think rebalacing bards is impossible atm. FIRST, verant needs to finish rebalacing casters because bards are 50% caster unlike the otherhybrids which are like 15% caster. Second, FIX THE FUCKING SONGS. tons of bards songs don't work as intended. you can't change songs, add songs, and balance songs when the god damn things are not working right. Third, rethink the fucking bard items. Epic=godly for bards. I think most of the bards would LOVE SOMPLACE to find an effect LIKE thier epic on another better weapon. They also I am SURE would like more better right clickies but they also need innate effects that are bard only since you can only click so many fucking slots at once while trying to play songs.<br>
<br>
Other then that, I really think bards need a minor upgrade to charm and a decent upgrade to mez ( I think chanters need this too ).  Bards should NOT get melee improvements. They are 50% melee at best and thus should suck at melee. thier power was and should again be thier songs while being protected by plate armor. ( bards can/do tank like a beast compared to robes) <p><img src="http://

Personally I love my bard, and I haven't always.  I got fed up with her for a while and switched mains but once she got her better mez song I got back into her and have a blast playing her.  It's sad that I still meet so many 50+ players that still don't really know the worth of a bard (and don't get me started on the damn &quot;oh we already have a bard&quot; one bard per group mentality or the morons who want you to play mana song...and NOTHING else).  Way too many people only think 1-2 things when a bard says LFG:  &quot;mana&quot; or &quot;haste.&quot;  Most people don't have a clue as to what else we can do.  &quot;Wow this is proccing a lot!&quot;  Hmmm could it be because I'm giving you a huge dex boost?  Etc, etc.  /rant off<br>
<br>
Honestly the only thing I wish could be changed is the casting time on some songs...especially mez...but maybe it just seems long when you've got the big pulls bitch slapping you and you are the only one in charge of crowd control.   Valarin's right, a better upgrade to mez and charm would be nice but I don't see it happening.  If VI made upgrades to those songs they'd probably be assholes about it and make it some ultra rare NPC dropped song.  I wonder sometimes if they just sit in their cubicle farm and think &quot;hmmm how shall we fuck bards next?  Hmmm...break their songs?  Did that.  Break their instruments?  Did that too.  Guess we'll just go back to designing butt ugly helms for half elves.&quot;<br>

Can't do a whole lot of damage, can't take a whole lot of damage...but we're basically casters that can wear plate and have a few more hit points.  We're there to make the other melee do more damage and help them be able to take more.  We're not there to tank, we're not for damage output, we're there to make a group more efficient.  Was grouped briefly with just a cleric in velks the other day before I got some other melee into the group...you don't wanna know how long it took me to kill a damn spider, it's embarrassing. <p><p align="center"><a href="http://www.twistedvortex.com/mystii"><big><font color="#0080FF"><strong>Mystii's

They wil never stop trying to balance the class, bards should expect by now that they wil need 2 days to fix ur shit per patch, get over it.  Rangers r awesome, i dont think we get fucked in anyway, i dont want to tank and have no desire to.<br>
<br>
Well i just woke up and hung over, dont got much else to say at this point.<br>

What sim said tho bout just playing the game and not living it, I got 1 thing to add!  Enjoy what you have not what you think you should have.  If you got so much probs with your class go play Quake3 where everyone is the same and only skill matters. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003399><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub37.ezboard.com/umelyssad.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MelyssaD</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.angelfire.com/darkside/mely/shari_pic.gif.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Harmonium Member</span><br> <font color=#FFFF00>(5/16/02 3:46:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub37.ezboard.com/fharmxevfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=422.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: An opinion to bards as unhappy as Thott..</span><hr size=1> *Hugz*  Simmie  !
