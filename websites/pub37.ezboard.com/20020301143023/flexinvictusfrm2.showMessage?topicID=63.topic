&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp             PRELUDE<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Once upon a time, in the land of Norrath, there was a man, a man named Morgrul. This man lived in a city called Erudin on the continent of Odus. Erudin was a world-wide hub for all of the magical studies of the land. There were three main schools of magic, Wizardry Enchantery and sorcery. Morgrul was a man whom wished to know all there is to know, so he secretly joined all three schools of Arcane. One day, while studing ancient text, he discovered that a different type of magic, an evil one, exisited. This type, known as necromancy, was powerful enough to raise the dead, create zombies, and command undead minions. Morgrul was intreiged, so he began studing forbidden scrolls and quickly he formed a band of Erudites to rebel against the common Erudites. The war was hard fought and used not swords and arrows but magic and elements. The war raged for many years untill the Necromancers were pushed back to the southern pennensula of Odus, where they colonized a large crater, and thus the city of Paineel came to be.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Morgrul fled to Antonica with many magical artifacts from Erudin, where he took shelter near the Winters Deep, a frozen lake just north of RiverVale. He later moved up to a labarynth of caverns he constructed himself, not by manual labour, but by magic.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He spent the next few years of his life on a yearly schedule, one year he would search for artifacts and scrolls the next year he would return to his caverns to study them. By this time he was around 500 years old, and he was weak, his charms and enchantments were no longer able to keep him alive. He returned to the city of Paineel, where he found a spell that could save him! A spell that could make him immortal by transforming himself into an undead monster. He needed a vial to put the contents of his living self into, so he stole one from one of the necromantic magi within the city walls. He quickly returned to his lair to attempt the unholy procedure. &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He had done everything right, but when the spell had been cast, Morgrul had trapped his soul in the vial and left of him outside the vial was only a lifeless lich. He could no longer learn and become more powerful, he could only walk the land a monster, forever.<br>

CHAPTER 1: HOPE<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Llanthas was a simple man, born into a family of underclass merchants living in a hut in Qeynos Hills. Llanthas went through his life with a sense of emptyness, until one day, a messenger came to his door.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Are you Llanthas?&quot; asked the messenger.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Yes,&quot; Llanthas choked, &quot;Why?&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Well sir, you are to meet the leader of all three schools of arcane in Erudin, Kera O'Derg, 'tis important business.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The next day he sailed to Erudin from Qeynos, where he met his owner, a nice woman in her late forties.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Greetings, young Llanthas, I hope your trip here was suitable&quot; she said kindly.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Aye mistress, it was&quot; he stuttered back.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I am very bust at the moment,&quot; she said tinkering with a few bits and peices of indistiguishable objects, &quot;Go to the library now and read A Opening Guide to the Young Mage. then Benril will show you to your room,&quot; she pointed at the Eruidite sitting in a chair fiddling with a dead frog, &quot;He has also been sent to aid you in your quest.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;You mean I am to become a mage?&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Yes yes of course, did you think you were a slave? Go on now, youve got alot to study, tommorrow I will speak to you of your purpose.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Llanthas read the book from cover to cover and felt very good, as if the empty space was slowly filling. This is what has been missing from my life, he thought to himself, I will study these scrolls and become the most powerful mage on Norrath! <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER 2: LLANTHAS' TRIP TO THE FOREST<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp When Llanthas had finished reading the book, he was able to start small fires on his desk and controll them somewhat, he could twist and form water in a glass, and blow small gusts of wind about. Basic magician tricks. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Are you finished with your book, Llanthas?&quot; Benril said from the hallway, knocking on the door.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Yes, it was very good, come in&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Benril was about six foot two, bald, and clad in a shiney plate mail. Clerical garb. &quot;Follow me to your room.&quot; he said.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Benril led Llanthas through winding roads through a amazing town. &quot;Step on that,&quot; Benril said pointing to a large blue crystal.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;What is it?&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;It's a telepad, it will teleport you to the residential district of Erudin, just go!&quot; They both stepped on the pad. Llanthas blinked and the scenery all around him changed from a grassy courtyard to a well lit entryway.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Your room is on the third floor, number three fifty seven&quot; Benril said, &quot;When you wish to return to the street step on this pad. In the morning, go to floor two, number two seventy three, thats my room, we must speak with Kera in the morning.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Thank you,&quot; Llanthas replied.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Ohh and get some sleep, I think we will need rest for the task&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Llanthas went to his room, it was a very large place, as if it was magically stretched to make it fit more into a smaller space. Everything he needed was in there, food, drink, a bed, even a few books on magician techniques. Ahh, this is my place, he thought, I am home.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *       *       *<br>
<br>
<br>
When he awoke, he went to meet Benril, they both took the Telepad back to the courtyard, and ran toward the library to see Kera.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Greetings, Llanthas, Benril. I hope you slept good.&quot; They nodded &quot;Lets get right to business. A band of evil kobolds have been blocking trade routes between us and our outpost in Kerra Ridge, they are a band of about eighteen people. They call themselves 'The Black Blood Tribe'. This is where you two come in. You two must venture into Toxxula Forest and go to their hideout near the old bridge, where you must defeat their leader, Rrhok Tumbumber. But first you must train up enough to stand a chance. Llanthas, you shall study and train until you are able to control the four basic elementals and can use the elements to cause great harm. Benril, you shall study untill you can cure poison, disease, heal, and take a decent hit. This means melee practice. I have been in contact with the Paladin guild leader, and he is willing to take you in for your melee training. Return to me when you are able to perform the tasks on these scrolls and be ready to demonstrate. Now go!&quot; She handed each of them peices of rolled up paper, and returned to her tinkering.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Only three weeks passed until Llanthas was able to perform his tasks. He could kill a large bear with an elemental alone, he could melt silver and freeze a large portion of water using only his mind.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Benril too finished his tasks. The paladin guild leader taught him well, and he could take the hits from a skilled pally. He could also heal and cure disease and poison. They were ready.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp They proved their worthiness to Kera very easily and set out with a guide from the protective walls of Erudin, into the dark Toxxula forest. The ground was moist from a recent storm, and the area was impossibly navigable to anyone unfamilliar with the lay of the land. Llanthas was lost the minute he lost sight of the guards post.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Here we are,&quot; said the young erudite guide, &quot;there is the bunch, dealing out money I suspect, I will not be able to aid you very well as I am not very powerful, but if you need help, I can provide some  assistance.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Llanthas and Benril entered the camp invisible thank to a spell Llanthas recently learned. There were five of them in a hut, four lackeys and one who was dressed up in sharp clothes (for a kobold).&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I think thats the guy,&quot; Benril whispered, pointing to the one in costume. &quot;He looks mean&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp They had already discussed stratagies, and they began with Llanthas creating an Earth Elemental, a particularly strong blob of dirt, capable of destroying a small building. He sent the elemental on one of the lackeys as they hid behind a tree, when the elemental had been half destroyed, Llanthas popped up and set the whole tent on fire. Benril healed the elemental as the screeching kobolds became frozen by cascading ice. In all the ruckus, the leader had ran out of the tent making his way toward Llanthas. Benril heaved a heavy blow from his hammar right in the head of the kobold, stunning it just long enough for Llanthas to throw a large fireball at the mutant dog. With a loud howl, it hit the grass, dead. The Elemental quickly finished the rest with a few well placed fireballs, and They looted all they could from the corpses.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp They returned to Kera, and she had left them a note. It read:<br>
<br>
<br>
Dear Llanthas and Benril, <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp If you are reading this , then you have succeded in your task. and i congradulate you. But, there is still much work to be done! There are many more kobold ruffians in the forest that need to be delt with. I am away on business, and i do not know when I may return, but speak with a man named Janof Sentef, he will tell you of more targets in the forest. <br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Yours in haste,<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Kera O'Derg<br>

<br>
CHAPTER 2: A STRANGE TRINKET<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Llanthas studied for the next 3 years of his life, becoming more and more powerful. He and Benril were responsible for the disbanding of several kobold tribes, but now the city had no more need for him, becasue the Gnomish Clockwork robots that had been delivered from Ak'Anon could deal with all of the threats, and much more efficiently. Llanthas started working in the library in the library to support his studies.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp One day, while Llanthas was on his break, he saw a small figure running about the courtyard, mumbling. The figure noticed him and quickly ducked into a nearby bush. Llanthas without hesitation, snaped his fingers and with a gust of air, the small figure was raised out of the shrub. It was a small bearded creature in a thick leather tunic and shiney boots, who was no bigger than Llanthas' leg.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Ello&quot; the small creature said, &quot;Tis' a fine day, eh?&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Who are you?&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Nomer I am.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Well Nomer, what are you doing here?&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;M m me?&quot; He spatted quickly. &quot;A wandering merchant of this fair land. Would you like to see my wares?&quot; He reached into a pocket and pulled out several small clockwork devices, they fell out and made loud clinking sounds as they hit the cobblestone road.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Llanthas glanced at the trinkets, eyeing a compass, a telescope and what seemed to be a scarab eggsack with a hose attached. But one caught his eye, a small wooden box with an old miniscule model of a steering wheel from a ship. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;What's that?&quot; Llanthas said.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I'm not sure what that is, but it's very rare, only one I've ever seen.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Yeah well, how much do you want for it?&quot; Llanthas said as he rattled a few coins in his pocket.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Four gold peices Nomer will charge you for this mystery trinket.&quot; Nomer said eying the lumps of coins in Llanthas' pocket.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Sounds fair, here.&quot; Llanthas tossed a few shiney coins at the small man. He then grabbed the trinket and bowed to Nomer, but before he could raise back up, he was gone.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Llanthas wandered back to the library to his room and studied the trinket carefully. He twisted the wheel and it made a few clicking sounds. He spun it around as fast as he could and the wheel stuck with a snap! Then it broke open revealing a small red stone. Llanthas took the stone carefully out of its case, and he held it to the light of the fire. He noticed nothing out of the ordinary. Then, suddenly, he remembered reading a scroll about how ancient mages put hidden messages in stones, and that the messages could be released by a simple charm. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Llanthas then flew to the books looking for the charm to see if the gem he had, indeed held a message.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;HA!&quot; Llanthas shouted, &quot;I've found it!&quot; Llanthas then scurried back to his room and then he read the charm aloud: &quot;Urukdim Sharukdum!&quot; (the charm was Dwarvish) <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The stone sat there for a bit, but then rattled and emitted an old mans voice: &quot;Hello, young mage, or at least I am led to believe you are a young mage, If you are hearing my voice, I know that you have found my gem and are willing to quest for knowlage, even if you are unaware of it. Now, to get down to business, I am Morgrul, necromantic mage once of the great city of Erudin, but forced to flee for my life to this place. You see, I have spent the past few hundred years of my life studying ancient text and the like, while using all my power to keep myself alive. Well, eventually my spells could no longer aid me, so I returned to the city of Paineel, just south of Erudin...&quot; Llanthas remembered hearing a legend about the city, and its evils &quot;...to find a charm that could allow me to live forever. I looked there for several months, and there, I had found it! A charm so powerful that it could turn the mortal immortal, so I could spend eternity learning and growing more and more powerful. I then went back to my cave to test it, i tested it on many rats and wolfs untill I was sure it would work on me, and then, I cast it and suddenly I blacked out. I awoke with a strange feeling about me. All I could see was the inside of my cave laboratory, and a lich standing firm and still right infront of me. It resembled what i thoguht I looked like and suddenly my heart sank, I had cast the spell wrong and now was trapped in one of the jars on my work-table! from there I am now recording this message and am going to send it to one of my secret telepads, where it will be flung to the far reaches of the planet. How you now come upon it I do not know. Heres what you need to do: Go to the city of Paineel, which will be a difficult task because as they only allow necromancers and the hybrid shadowknights. Do this anyway you can, study necromancy, and try not to look conspicuos. You can study necromancy in the town of Neriak, Freeport, and even the gnomish city of Ak'Anon. Then once inside paineel, you must find the countercharm and return to me with it. My soul is located in the caverns beneath the fridgid plain, just east of the town of Halas, and north of Rivervale. I will reward you greatly. I bid you good luck, and may Bertoxxulus aid you! Farewell.&quot; The stone gave a sharp hiss and went dim. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Llanthas pondered this greatly. What if he will just use me? Though Llanthas. What if he only wishes to escape and Kill me? Thought like this continued for several hours. Finally, exausted by thought, Llanthas went to sleep and fell into an uneasy dream filled with spectral shapes and ghostly figures. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp CHAPTER 3: Melkor<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Llanthas decided, that if he were to even think of doing this quest, he would first go to Neriak, city of the Teir'Dal. But where in all of Norrath is Neriak? and how does he get there? Llanthas had heard the townsfolk speak of evil and witchcraft coming from Neriak, and that it was far east of Qeynos, and its protective walls.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Llanthas then approached Bernil, who had been visiting his relatives in High Hold. &quot;Hail, Benril. Tis' a fine day today!&quot; Said Llanthas.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Oh hello, Llanthas.&quot; whispered Benril, &quot;SHH! The guards are after me! Can we talk somewhere else?&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Ohh yes, of course&quot; replied Llanthas. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp They both walked off, down to the local tavern, and ordered a few beers. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;What is all the whispering about?&quot; Asked Llanthas.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Well you see,&quot; replied Bernil, &quot;I've accedenally broken a clockwork merchant in the courtyard. The dumb thing was malfunctioning, kept spitting out copper this way-and that. I gave it a good whack with my hammer, and it started making clicks at me. One of the guards saw me, and ran me out. But whats up with you? You sound rather urgent.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Well, this is going to sound crazy,&quot; said Llanthas, &quot;but I've come in contact with a small red stone.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Ohh wow, so you found a Ruby good for yo-&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;No, no, not a ruby, a mystical stone that contained a secret message from an old evil-&quot; Llanthas lowered his voice, &quot;an old evil -- Necromancer!&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Oh, now youve gone completely bonkers! I suggest you not mix old coots tales with Ol'Tujums Feirce Brew no more, Llanthas. Your getting dilusional. There aint no such thing as Necromancers, or the city of Paineel.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Excuse me, lad.&quot; Said a tall Barbarian with a long white beard. &quot;Did I just hear you mention the name Paineel?&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Uhh, yes, yes you did Mister....&quot; Choked out Benril. &quot;Why do you ask?&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Well y'see, I've been there m'self, not a pretty place. You better not be messing around with necromancers and the like, just getting yourself into more and more trouble, I say.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Well I was just explaining to my friend here-&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I heard what y'were saying, I heard the whole conversation. 'Bout the merchant goin' mad, and the ruby, and I think I might have to introduce you to my friend. Hes pretty learned in all the past of necromancy and Paineel. He said hes been searching for any message or sign of an evil necromancer. So you'd best be coming with me.&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The barbarian led the two, reluctant, humans to a small apartment in the north of Erudin, by the port authority.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Ey! Ey, Melkor!&quot; Shouted the Barbarian. &quot;I got some lads ere that need t'see you!&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Alright,&quot; answerd a smooth voice answered from behind a closed door. &quot;I'll be right out.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The door drew open and a small, white haired blue faced elf appeared, wearing a black robe with green trim. A Dark Elf!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;He's, he's an Inkie! Get him away!&quot; Benril shouted and ran towards the door. Click! The door was locked. Then he began to cry.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;These two lads know of something that might intrest you, Sir.&quot; Said the barbarian.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Ahh yes, you have done well, McMaffen.&quot; Said Melkor slowly. &quot;What do you know that I might be interested in young fools?&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Uhh.. Uhh...&quot; said the two flabberghasted young humans.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;SPEAK!&quot; Said Melkor as he began to cast a spell on both the boys, making them dizzy. &quot;Now....tell me what you know&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I have found a small red ruby which inside a message was hidden.&quot; Replied Llanthas. &quot;A message from an evil necromancer named Morgul. He has told me that he is trapped in a small jar on his desk and that he needs to be helped to get out. He says I am to venture to Paineel where I am to find the counter-charm for his entrapment and bring it to him. He is located north of Rivervale and east of Halas, in the Fridgid Plain. This is all I know.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Ahh! You have found it! Very good. We leave at once.&quot; Said Melkor raising his voice.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;W, W, We? Whaddya mean we?&quot; Said Benril, stil sobbing. &quot;What makes me a part of this?&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;You were here and you know of the location of Morgul. You are in danger. You must come with us on a journy to free him!&quot; Said McMaffen. &quot;Your coming with us!&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The barbarian hit them both on the head and tied them up. Llanthas blacked out. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Now,&quot; Said Melkor &quot;We are to go to Neriak where we will get supplys, and plan what we are to do. These fools will study to be more evil, so that they will be allowed in Paineel as I don't believe Morgrul will enjoy me bringing him any help. We leave for Antonica tomorrow!&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter 4: The Ruffian and Pyzjin<br>
<br>
The next day, Llanthas and Benril awoke on an boat, sailing through the waters of Erud's crossing. A salty wind was blowing.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Ey boss, They're 'wake.&quot; Said McMaffen. Melkor nodded, glancing at a suspicious figure in reinforced leather clothes. The figure noticed Melkor and stood up.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;What are you looking at, drow?&quot; he snapped feircly. &quot;See anything interesting?&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I was just noticing that your shirt is ripped, right THERE!&quot; Melkor blurted as he waved a finger downwards. A gash in the ruffian's shirt ripped from his upper arm down, and his arm began to bleed.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;You dirty...&quot; The ruffian said, running straight at Melkor, fists readied. Melkor quickly snapped his fingers and pointed to the sky. The ruffian flew into the air, above the sail, and into the water. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;That will teach you to play with the Teir'Dal!&quot; Melkor shouted in content, as a large shark took the ruffian underwater. Cloudy red blood floated to the surface. Then the boat came to a stop on a small island.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Melkor hopped off the boat onto the dock, and looked around. A few scruffy looking humans, a couple wisps of light, and a rather suspicious hiding halfling rogue... Melkor could read what people were thinking, and bad thoughts were infesting this particular rogues mind. Melkor waved his hand at the Halfling and it flew against a tree and rolled down the hill. As he got to the bottom he went unconcious.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Why did you do that?!?&quot; Llanthas screamed, &quot;What did he do to you?&quot;&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Silence! young fool! There are many among us who wish to stop our course of action. He was one of them. The air about Norrath is changing, things are not the same,&quot; he lowered his voice, &quot;The second coming of Morgrul is upon us. Now come, we must get back on the boat.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The rest of the boat ride went smoothly, and they made it to the docks in Qeynos.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;The guards of this town do not take a liking to me,&quot; Said Melkor, &quot;we must take the sewers. follow me!&quot; He jumped into the water and held his breath. the others did the same.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The run through the sewers was suprisingly uneventful. Llanthas had always pictured it as an evil place filled with undead and...Necromancers!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Hello, Melkor&quot; said a dark voice from an adjacent corridor. An evil figure appeared in a flash of light leaving the party half blind. &quot;Good to see you, who are these fools?&quot;&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Hey, Drachna, you should remember McMaffen&quot; Melkor replied. McMaffen raised his axe. &quot;These are some people who are going to help us uncover the location of Morgrul.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Drachna gasped. &quot;These pale rots?&quot; He said, &quot;Well im suprised they survived the boat ride, what do they have to do with Master Morgrul?&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;The human found a message, and Morgrul will be looking for him. The other one knows of Morgrul and is in danger, I could not leave him in that town to be killed. We are in haste, take us to the outside!&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Drachna led them through more corridors and passage-ways until they swam up and came out of a small hole in the wall of Qeynos. &quot;Thank you, Drachna, you have been most helpful.&quot; said Melkor as he waved goodbye.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp They wandered out into the hills and passed a familliar bunch of farmland. It was Llanthas' old farm! He told the others to wait as he greeted his parents and sisters.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He opended the door and what he found was a small figure in a black robe lurching over the bodies of four humans... his family! He lunged quickly at the small figure, his fists on fire, but a powerful skeleton hit him on the back. He reeled in pain, and gave a sharp cry. A few seconds later, a magical blast discintegrated the door and Melkor stood, pointing a finger at the Necromancer. &quot;PYZJIN!&quot; he screamed &quot;Now you die!&quot; Pyzjin was lifted into the air revealing that it was a female gnome carrying a red orb. She imploded in on herself and the only trace left of her was the small red orb.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Benril tended to Llanthas' wounds as Melkor studied the orb. &quot;Ingenious,&quot; He said, &quot;it has a certain glow to it. It seems to enhance my intellect. Here Llanthas, you use it.&quot; He tossed the stone to Llanthas who was still crying. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Eh, sir.&quot; McMaffen said &quot;I think we had better get out of here, and fast. That woman has allies in the hills, They will be ere soon.&quot;&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;You are right, Maff,&quot; Melkor said &quot;Llanthas, are you going to be okay?&quot;&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I guess,&quot; Llanthas sobbed &quot;I want to leave this place now.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp They set out again toward the plains of Karana.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Proon, Mroon and Froon.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As they got far off in the plain, an eerie wind swept up a green mist off of the dead fields.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Ahh, Bertoxxulus is smiling upon us this day!&quot; Melkor said as he threw his hands into the air.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;If this is smiling I'd hate to see what hes like on his bad days&quot; Muttered Benril to try and cheer Llanthas up. It didnt work.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp They stomped on through the green muck.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;RRHHAAAAAGG!!&quot; a loud thunderous scream pounded into the partys ears. Its source was the three fabled Cyclopii of that region, Proon, Mroon, and Froon. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Melkor said a short phrase in an unknown tongue and the entire party was swept several hundred feet backward, thus buying them time to ready for the fight.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Using the mushy soil, Llanthas was able to construct a decent sized elemental. McMaffen readied his shield, and kept a hold on the handle of his axe. Melkor stood with his feet rooted into the ground. Benril fell over.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;RRHHAAAAAGG!!&quot; the beasts roared as they turned to face their targets.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Weegot eliso Blarlesnaf.&quot; Mroon said to his brothers. Which translated loosly can mean &quot;Grab the 'dite&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Roo?&quot; the others asked.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;WEEGOT ELISO BLARLESNAF&quot; they all shouted at once, sprinting (if such a light word can be used to describe cyclopii movement.) toward their targets.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Melkor raised a steady hand and made an odd gesture. The grass in front of the running giants was set ablaze with a white hot fire. Proon and Mroon jumped through it, but poor Froon hesitated and was caught in the raging wall of fire. &quot;RRHHAAAAAAAaaaa.&quot; were the last words uttered by this Legendary beast.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The other two, not even thinking about the loss of their brother, were still barreling toward the company. Mroon lifted a leg to kick Benril, but caught the axe of McMaffen in mid swing, It seared the flesh of Mroon's thigh, and shattered his upper leg bone all the way up to his hip. Another Great &quot;RHHHAAAAGGG!&quot; echoed throughout the plain as the second of the trio fell. McMaffens axe was left stuck in the beast's thigh to be picked up by the last Cyclops.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Llanthas backed off a few steps and sent his Lump of dirt at the third, and final monster. It was instantly ripped to peices by Proon's newly aquired axe and fell back down to the mud of the plain. Llanthas, panicked and filled with the thought of his dead family, erupted into a huge fireball that singed the grass in a wide radius. The fireball accomplished no more because its maker suddenly fell to the ground, his energies spent. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Melkor shot a jet of water at Proon's eye, and froze it in midair, turning it into a spear of pure ice. &quot;RHHHAAAGGG&quot; the final monster spat as his optical fluids spilt onto the green dirt.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It's dying words were &quot;Melkor, shabdoo sas nag nothy loty&quot; Which Melkor later translated to be &quot;Melkor, fear the hand of Zek. &quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Llanthas laid on the ground, his face paled. &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;His mental energies were taxed with his fireworks show, he has much to learn.&quot; Melkor said.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Llanthas gurgled.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Llanthas's &quot;Trip&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Llanthas awoke in a cave. His vision was blurred and strange colors seemed to float on his eyeball. On the wall were swirling paintings of the days events.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp His dead family. The necromancer Pyzjin. The ruffian and the rogue. The huge cyclopses. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp All were pictures intertwining with themselfs. Then appeared a new picture of himself lying on the ground in a green hazy plain. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He rubbed his eyes and stood up. Everything seemed normal, his robe, his hair, his new shiney rock. Everything except his location, a cave. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp KNOCK KNOCK. &quot;Opun dis door, hummie, joo ben asleep fer tu long!&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Llanthas approached a dim door. It swung open at his presence. Before him stood the oddest being he had ever seen. It was a Giant pukeygreen troll. He readied himself for a fight, but the troll was weilding only a plate and a bent key. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Food&quot; it said presenting Llanthas the plate filled with a strange meat. &quot;Joo eat dis. un den joo talk to Rhoknar. Himz got somfin fer joo!&quot; It added with a toothy grin.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Llanthas ate the meat, and found it suprisingly appetizing. The hazy colors faded away with every bite. When he was finished he left the room and found himself in a dimly lit hallway extending in either direction. He had the sudden urge to turn left and follow the corridoor to its end. As he passed by each door, a different sensation overtook him. Hunger at one, pain at another. When he got to the end of the corridoor, the ground below him began to rise, and he was slowly lifted several stories until it stopped with a thud. before him now stood a hall of great magnificence.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Large marble pillars lined a walkway carpeted with a crimson red rug. Hanging from the ceiling were banners with different symbols on them. A spring in the forest. A rock glowing green. A wisp of air. A bright red flame. Each symbols of the elements at his command. At the end of the carpet, sat a man. Tall, crowned by a wreath of mist, eyes fitted in deep sockets, and robed in white. Llanthas looked up at him and walked forward. The man put out his hand. His wreath turned from a mist to a solid watery blue color. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Llanthas&quot; The man said slowly, &quot;Do you know where you are?&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;No, not really&quot; Llanthas added, &quot;It looks like The Felewith guild hall&quot; (Llanthas had seen paintings of it)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Well, no&quot; The man replied, &quot;This is your mind, your psyche. I am Rhoknar, master of thought. You have came here now because you have proven yourself dedicated to mastery of elements. You fell on the plains of Karana. When you made that fireball, to save your friends, to save thought of your family, you were granted access to these halls. You now can learn all there is to know. The greatest mages in all of Norrath strive to reach this goal. Most fail. The only sure fire way to attain this goal is, unfortunatly, to do whats required without even knowing of this place. You have done this. Whenever you wish, you may come here. You will be exposed in the real world, but here you would be safe. Here lies the library of your memory, the rooms of your emotions, the halls of your sensations. All you need to come here is a cleansed state of mind, and a untainted spirit. Once you commit any deed out of pride, greed, or glutany, you forfit your &quot;key&quot; to this place. Remember my words, the material world beckons&quot; Rhoknar's wreath turned to an earthy brown as he stood up. He pointed at Llanthas and Llanthas disappeared.&quot;<br>
