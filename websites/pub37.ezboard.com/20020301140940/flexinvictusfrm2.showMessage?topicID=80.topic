This was not the case from within. A boy on the cusp of manhood sat propped up against a building, surveying the wreckage of what was once exactly what the onlooker might discern. The battle torn bodies, the wounded that lay around him painted an entirely different picture though. He lay there, half propped upon the stone edge of the building waiting to die, knowing that soon enough it would come, and he would with luck join his kin in the afterlife just as assuredly as the rest that had barely survived the slaughter would as well.<br><br>His memory of the evening past was vivid still, the sound of metal hitting metal, the fizzle and snapping of spells launched within the confines of contained areas, the smell and feel of blood as it coated the area with the blood of his townsfolk and family. Death seemed a blessing at this point, for he was still unable to fathom the brutal assault after all he had been taught to believe in the past. As unthinkable as it was, the young man recalled the faces of his attackers. They were pale skinned as he was, but they bore no tribal markings, no colors of war stained upon their cheeks. The assault was carried out by ones often thought of as allies by his people, the pale skinned elven people that he was told once warred with his people, but now were seen as brothers and sisters in the cause. Why then had they attacked his people so mercilessly? What crime could possibly warrant such a slaughter?<br><br>Wind howled around him as he lay there, feeling his body weaken as the day wore on, fear riding him as he heard the sounds of horse hoofs clapping against the iced cobbled roads, drawing closer with each passing second. Finally the rider came into view, and a weak gasp escaped the youth as he looked up at the man that had become nearly a legend within the village. This legend who was once a mischievious and bold renegade while growing up here, had become part of one of the most ruthless and powerful guilds throughout the known lands. He watched as the older barbarian shifted his glance through the wreckage, recognised the anger as it welled up within him. The youth cringed back when the legend slid from his horse, tethering it to a pole, swinging his glance to find him. He froze for a moment as he saw the battered boy that was perhaps the last conscious victim of the massacre that had occurred. His voice was gruff, terrofying as he growled, &quot;Who did this to my home?&quot;<br><br>Shocked at the possesive tone, frightened that the rage was going to be visited upon him, the boy quickly, albeit weakly answered, &quot;A band of druids and perhaps a few others.&quot; His answer seemed to cause another wave of rage to hit the barbarian man, his fists balling as he rasped through clenched teeth, &quot;They would dare attempt vengeance for the deeds of a charlaton? They attack my home....&quot; It was all too evident that the man before him seemed to know what had caused the attack, and that he perhaps even was the catalyst or reason that it had occurred. Quickly the man gathered his reigns again, the barest hint of guilt seeming to blend within the rage that consumed him, and tossing a few rations at the youth before him he muttered a few words until his armor glowed and a small surge of strength filled the boy. &quot;That will have to hold you until I get back.&quot; Without further conversation the man was grinding his heels into the haunches of the horse, and it flew forward, dashing out of the village at a nearly unthinkable speed. A combination of hope and hopelessness filled the youth that was left behind.  Hope filled him that perhaps all was not lost, and fear that the words were hollow, and that he'd be left to die again, only this time having been given extra time to relive the terrofying events of the night prior.<br><br>Drifting into a restless sleep he found respite for a while, only to be woken again by the sounds of a horse approaching. Again the barbarian man from earlier came thundering into the village, but from the looks of it he was not alone. Bewilderment furrowed the youths brow as he thought he saw what looked like blue arms twined about his waist. Terror and astonishment riddled through him as he saw for the first time what he had been taught was without question 'the enemy', this enemy was not towering by any means, nor was she feral and bestial as stories portrayed her kind. What he noticed first about the female drow hovering above him was the hair.   Like white spun silk spilling down around her waist, with many intriquite braids threaded down the temples and at the crown of her head, her hair looked like a curtain of snow.  Her skin as well was something of a marvel, a dusky blue reminiscent of a winter sky before a storm while at the same time in the right light glimmering opalescent, a myriad of colors coming to life within the delicate frame.  It took forever for her to finally look at him, and a gasp was drawn from his throat as he saw for the first time the eyes of drow.  Glowing like tricolored jewels, the eyes fixed upon him steadily, the outer edge of the iris a molten gold, within that a circle of jade, and lastly, a ring of bright emerald that seemed to chase around the pitch of her pupils.  <br><br>Her head cocked slightly to the side, her arm lifting as a few dangling charms slid down the flesh, pointing at him as she spoke tersely to the barbarian man that had brought her.  He came back at her with immediate anger, which seemed to catch her by surprise, making her draw a step backwards.  His voice was almost a growl, low in common, “It’s only a boy, you can spirit yourself away as you do the others, you gave your word priestess.”  In his desperation to save his fallen people his voice seemed to carry a hint of threat to it, as if cautioning the priestess from arguing further.  The arrogance that he had heard of in the drow race became increasingly evident as she lifted her chin and scowled at him, though it was also clear that she was not foolish as she chose not to argue further. With a curt nod, she closed her eyes, slowly lifting her arms as if raising upwards some invisible weight, drawing from it the magic that crashed outwards like a wave, pouring life into those that were near death, but not yet offering the miracle of life beyond death.   Words poured from her throat like honey, her voice deep, tones destined for darkness and shadows spilling over him like a blanket as he felt his body sing in response, flesh mending itself deep within, knitting back together in eagerness to do her bidding.  The fear on his face must have been evident, because for a moment she paused, one side of her mouth lifting in the darkest of wicked smiles.  Slowly she began to speak, the language his own, but the exotic lilt like nothing he’d ever heard before, “The flesh knows no pride young one, I will call to it and channel the essence of my powers into it, and it will obey the magics whether your mind rebels or not.” <p><CENTER><HR WIDTH=250><FONT COLOR="RED" FACE="ARIAL"><B><I>Cute little cup-cake, baked by the devil!</I></B></FONT><BR><img src="http://www.pbbr.com/test/synnsig.jpg"><br><A HREF="http://synnovea.no-frills.net"><font face="ARIAL">Phasmatis ex Machina</font></a><BR><a href="http://pub37.ezboard.com/blexinvictus"><font face="ARIAL">Lex Invictus Bulletin Board</font></a></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub37.ezboard.com/usynnoveaeq.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SynnoveaEQ</A> at: 2/8/02 10:49:29 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub37.ezboard.com/ukendreck.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kendreck</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#70DB93>(2/5/02 4:11:55 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub37.ezboard.com/flexinvictusfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=80.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: (in progress)</span><hr size=1> rut roh <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub37.ezboard.com/unanookt.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nanook T</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ph3aR my witty sig</span><br>  Posts: 196<br> <font color=#70DB93>(2/6/02 5:40:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub37.ezboard.com/flexinvictusfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=80.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: (in progress)</span><hr size=1> More!
