'A Knight of the Shadows,'  he thought.  'A fitting name for my profession, although i have yet to achieve the actual rank of Knight...'  In the distance, he heard shouts and screams, punctuated with the occasional explosion.  Curious, he hailed a nearby guard.  &quot;What goes on out there, friend?&quot;  he asked, noting the guard's almost condenscending attitude toward him.<br>
<br>
     &quot;Why, tis the younglings bickering amongst themselves, trying to impress the unimpressable watchers, the Lords of Neriak.  If you wish to find favor in the city, it might be wise to go join in the fray.&quot;  The young one swore he could see laughter in the guards eyes, even through his concealing helm.<br>
<br>
     &quot;Bah, must I?&quot;  He shook his head.  &quot;I have no desire to impress anyone with my talents.  I know what I am capable of, and do not need to impress any but the Great Lord himself.  All the same, i do need to work on the fighting skills necessary for advancement in my guild.&quot;  He turned slowly, a look of resignation on his not-quite-delicate features.  The guard paused for a moment, and then hailed the younger elf.<br>
<br>
    &quot;Who are you, youngling, and of what house do you belong?&quot;<br>
<br>
    The younger one paused, and then slowly turned around, his face set in a grimace/smirk that gave the much more experienced guard a chill right down his spine.  &quot;My name, sir, is Shaiith, and as to my house...&quot;  All traces of amusement disappeared, leaving nothing but a mask of pain and hatred.  &quot;I have no house, sir, but the house the Necromancers gave me.&quot;  With that, he turned once more, set his spine straight, and ran off with nary a look back toward the noise and commotion.<br>
<br>
     'No house,' the guard wondered, 'no house and... Shaiith?  Nameless?  What secrets do you hold, young Nameless Knight?'  After a few moments of thought, the guard shrugged at his sentry partner and went back to his vigil.<br>
<br>
     In the distance, a new voice was heard... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub37.ezboard.com/unanookt.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nanook T</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ph3aR my witty sig</span><br>  Posts: 45<br> <font color=#70DB93>(12/4/01 7:34:05 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub37.ezboard.com/flexinvictusfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=51.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fiction that has NOTHING TO DO WITH GRUUZ</span><hr size=1> Nice work Gruuz.

If it hadn't been for the assistance of the other Dark Elves, he would'nt have stood a chance against the angry Kodiak.  He paused for reflection, and thought back to the beginning of the ordeal....<br>
<br>
<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
     Slamming his cheap wooden shield into the rump of the fleeing wolf,  he raised his sword and brought it down in one decisive chop.  Severing a bit of meat from the still twitching corpse, he sighed at the loss of the pelt; he was still missing a decent pair of pants.  The skin of the wolf he had just killed wasn't good enough to even make the patchwork armor he wore on the rest of his body.<br>
<br>
    Sensing something wrong, he spun about, crouching to meet whatever threat approached.  He wasn't ready for what faced him.  There, running at him full tilt, was a young kodiak bear, rare in these woods but deadly to the young ones.  There was only one course available to Shaiith:  he ran.  As fast as he could.<br>
<br>
     He wasn't fast enough.<br>
<br>
     The huge creature overtook him swiftly, missing with the first swipe of its great paw, but catching him decisively with the next one, knocking him to the ground.  Shaiith was forced to lay there, catching his breath.  He kept as still as he could, hoping that his little play-dead game would deter the bear.  Not fooled in the slightest, the bear hooked its claws into the back of his leg and threw him forward.  Luckily for Shaiith, that was the way he had been trying to go.<br>
<br>
     He flew through the air, almost landing on top of the great log that the novice dark elves used as a base.  Screaming for assistance in a very un-Knightlike fashion, he scrambled painfully to his feet and turned to face his foe.  For a brief, terrifying moment, he thought his cries were in vain.  No one heard him!  Then, as a burst of flame enveloped the kodiak's head, he gave thanks to Innoruuk (never more devoutly before!) that he was not alone.<br>
<br>
     A small elemental came at the beast from the side, and another burst of flame impacted on the side opposite.  Another young Dark Elf bearing a sword marginally better than his, and with slightly more skill, was at his side, swinging and dodging.  Behind him he heard, &quot;My Lord Innoruuk, grant this pitiful creature before me respite from his pain!&quot;  The words seemed to ring inside his head, as the latest claw marks on his leg began to close.  Slightly.<br>
<br>
     He snarled, and with all the hatred he could muster, slammed his fist directly into the creature's sensitive nose.  As he connected, he felt a peculiar sensation:  all the hate in his body was being drawn into that one punch.  In an explosion of red light, the bear's head snapped back as if yanked by some Gnomish contraption.  Staggering, the thing turned to run.  Knowing it would come back, but unable to continue farther, Shaiith all but collapsed where he stood.  <br>
<br>
     The young cleric behind him, seeing that he lived and was therefore no longer worth her attention, intoned, &quot;My Lord, assist me now, strike this creature down where it stands!&quot;  Another explosion, nowhere near as powerful, bit at the bear's hindquarters, slowing it down.  Its other pursuers, anxious to skin the creature and take its valuable pelt to sell, redoubled their efforts.  Bursts of flame and the flash of steel followed the creature as it ran.<br>
<br>
     Finally, it fell.  the Dark Elf in the robe, the source of the flame, ran to the carcass and pulled out a small skinning knife.  The warrior that had stood beside Shaiith gave the greedy mage a disgusted look and continued about his own personal business.<br>
<br>
<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
<br>
   Wincing anew as his mind came back to the present,  Shaiith realized that the others had only helped out of ambition.  The Unseen would espy, and see that these young ones were indeed able to work as a team, regardless (or perhaps because of) personal motives.  The Unseen would approve, and grant these little ones with more responsibility, and the chance to go spread their hate into the world.<br>
<br>
     Reaching into the small bag hung on his belt, Shaiith realized another, more important thing:  he was out of bandages.  Sighing, he leaned back up against the log and waited for the long slow process of healing to begin.  He would have no scars, Innoruuk would see to that, but the pain wouldn't go away for a while.  He had plenty of time to reflect.<br>
<br>

Too many people, there had been, and Shaiith was not fond of crowds.  To be honest (and honor demanded honesty, at least to himself), the fighting around the fallen tree was tedious and repetitive, the same young dark elves trying to impress the same elders.  There was no change, there was no relief, there was no holding THIS young dark elf back from exploring any longer.  He wanted to see the lands he would someday conquer.<br>
<br>
     Breathing in the fresh air, he gave a rare smile.  His hair, dyed a light shade of grey, blew gently in the breeze.  The night was calm, and dark for those without gifts such as his.  He almost felt sorry for them, these... humans.  Almost.  the darkness, with barely a sliver of moon to light it, was much brighter than any light he had ever seen before.  It mattered not to him.  His skills and expertise were as such that the Great Lord was almost ready to grant him his spells.  This was good.  More ways he could bring suffering to the races that embraced the light.<br>
<br>
     As if on cue, a movement caught his eye.  Cursing his own ineptitude, the young dark elf quickly cloaked himself in a veil of non-seeing, which allowed him to remain hidden even though an observer might pass but two paces near.  He took in the sight, and chuckled.  A lone elf, a warrior by the look of him, wearing leather armor and carrying a sword that looked a little fine for one so young, even by the elven standards of quality.  This one had friends in high places, and his presence here was probably an initiation of sorts.  It was almost certain he was being watched from afar.  Shaiith quickly gauged his opponent, and found him worthy.  Smiling to himself, he waited for an opportune moment to make his presence known.<br>
<br>
     He didn't have to wait long.  The elf turned and looked behind him, attempting to watch his back and make sure he wasn't taken from behind.  That was never Shaiith's intention.  With a feral grin in place, he dropped the concealing cantrip and chuckled softly.  The effect was instantaneous.<br>
<br>
     The pale one spun around so fast he nearly fell, and snapped into a familiar fighting position.  Shaiith chuckled again, realizing that this was no warrior.  This was what the wood elves called a ranger, a druid who took up the blade.  He studied his opponents features, committing them to memory, wanting to remember what his first kill looked like with his head still intact.  He saw the pale brown hair, eyes the color of the leaves on the trees, and a beautiful face that was now drawn into a tight, pensive expression of wariness.  With a start, Shaiith realized that his opponent was female!  He chuckled again and shrugged.  Male, female, it made no difference to him.  If they wore a sword with the intention to use it, as this one did, then they were dead.  Gender meant little.<br>
<br>
     On the elf's part, as she studied her opponent who had seemingly come out of nowhere, She saw an elven face, but with bluish black skin, and the features were twisted into what could only be called a sneer of contempt.  By human standards, this one was still handsome, but to her aesthetic eye, his face was too course, the eyebrows too thick, the nose too narrow, giving the dark one a predatorial look.  She had no doubts as to what- or who - his prey was.<br>
<br>
     No visible or audible sign was heard, but one moment they stood facing each other, and in the next there was a flash of steel, a loud clash, and muttered curses as the dark figure drew back, holding his arm above the elbow.  Crimson drops stained the burnished bronze armplates as he inspected the wound.  He nodded:  he could still fight.<br>
<br>
     Throwing himself suddenly into a headlong dive at her feet, he rolled with his blade angled slightly out, hoping to at least nick her legs.  The pale one was too quick, and jumped over the hurtling form, performing a frontflip an acrobat would have been proud of.  Coming down lightly, she spun, thrusting her sword at where the shape had been.   It wasn't there, and the tip sunk into the soft earth.  A flurry of movement ahead told her what had happened:  the dark elf hadn't stopped rolling after the initial attack.  Now the tip of his great sword was shooting towards her chest, hoping to remove her heart.  She accepted the worst of the blow, but turned aside.  The resulting wound was painful, but not lethal.  She wasn't done.<br>
<br>
     Feinting a thrust, she quickly stopped just short of her target, switching the maneuver into a downward chop that caught the dark one completely off guard.  The blade passed within inches of his head, scoring deeply into his shoulder.  With surprising speed, he stood and stepped back a pace.  That last attempt had nearly been the end of him.  It was all he could do to maintain a defense against the blows that came fast and furious now.<br>
<br>
     Desperation lent Shaiith strength, but he knew the outcome of this battle.  He would die, his body be left for the scavengers, and anything of value on him would be taken.  Suddenly, he felt the old surge of hatred.  This harmful touch had saved his life in the past, and now he called upon it again.  Throwing every last ounce of strength into his next few blows, he managed to strike the pale one repeatedly, scoring hits on shoulder, chest, and thigh.  Weakened, the elf staggered back out of range of that deadly blade.  Not far enough.<br>
<br>
     Lunging at his opponent as she retreated, the young Knight of shadows let the hatred build, burn, and boil its way through his body.  Focusing the energy as his mentor had taught him, he slammed his fist into the delicate bone structure of the elven wench's face.  The hatred flowed to a focal point in his hand, and with the familiar hissing whine and stench of ozone, the young elven female's face exploded into a fine red mist.  The corpse dropped lifelessly to the soft ground, a small pool of red slowly growing larger around the fallen head.<br>
<br>
     Clutching his wounded shoulder, Shaiith again called the veil of shadows and crumpled next to his fallen foe.  <br>
<br>
     Darkness came.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
PAIN!!<br>
<br>
Agony!  Excruciating, palpitating, throbbing, grinding PAIN!!<br>
<br>
He lived.  How, he had no clue, but he lived.  Faces swam around him, a dark voice whispered...  my lord, help me, your servant, your child... I?  Help another?  Impossible!  ...my lord, please, you know i live only to serve... Impossible i say!  Show yourself, Phantom!<br>
<br>
  At those words, the shadows seemed to coalesce.. a vision he saw, which could not be true... there, lying on the grass next to another body, that of the dead elven bitch!  He gasped, shocked, as he realized that body was his!! <br>
<br>
How is this possible?  How can this be?  The form on the ground stirred slightly... it... HE... was still breathing, albeit slightly.  The phantom voice rang in his head.  ...Lord, please...  It was coming from... the body!  HIS body!!  <br>
<br>
YOU SEE, LITTLE ONE, HOW IMPERFECT AND FRAGILE YOUR EXISTENCE IS TO ONE SUCH AS MYSELF<br>
<br>
My lord?<br>
<br>
YET SOMEHOW YOU THINK TO CALL ME FATHER<br>
THIS AMUSES ME NO END<br>
<br>
My Lord Innoruuk!<br>
<br>
SOME CHOOSE TO NAME ME SUCH<br>
MORE AMUSEMENT FOR ME, I AM ABOVE SUCH NAMING<br>
<br>
Great Lord... what has happened?  Why am i here?<br>
<br>
YOU DO NOT PAY VERY MUCH ATTENTION, MORTAL<br>
<br>
YOU AMUSE ME<br>
<br>
IF I CHOSE YOU WOULD NOW GO TO THE AFTERLIFE...  AND I DO NOT THINK THAT YOU WOULD APPRECIATE WHAT YOU FOUND THERE<br>
<br>
BUT THE AMUSEMENT SUFFICES... YOU BRING DEATH TO THE LIGHT, AND USE THE POWERS I GAVE YOU WISELY<br>
<br>
The darkness coalesced upon the hapless knight once more, and when he awoke, he was standing near the entrance to Neriak, wearing only light clothing.  His.. body?  was in the eastern commonlands, near the ridge between Nektulos forest and Freeport.  It didn't take him long at all to get there, although when he did, he got many strange looks from people.  He didn't understand at first, but then he realized they were seeing a dark elf strip a corpse that looked just like himself, and then putting on the plate armor like it was custom fitted for him.<br>
<br>
As he did, he heard that fearsome voice once more, now only a whisper<br>
<br>
go, my son, go forth and kill, that i may have my revenge upon the gods of light<br>
<br>
i have granted you new powers as well, use them as wisely as you have the ones you already had<br>
<br>
He chuckled to himself... amusement for the Lord?  If that was what the Father wanted from him, then he would give it.  Elves...  Humans... even the diminuitive ones.  They would feel his wrath for his Lord's amusement.  He tried to be a good son.<br>
<br>
He stood, and looked to the night sky.  It was a perfect night to sacrifice to his Lord.  He ran swiftly into the near distance, seeking a new victim.<br>
<br>
In the distance, a cry of pain, and even further away, phantom laughter...<br>

At a dead sprint, he moved.  <br>
He wasn't fast enough.<br>
<br>
The pale imitation of himself he had been chasing ran faster than he had any right to.  The elf stopped briefly, allowing Shaiith to get a bit closer, and muttered something under his breath.  Instantly, the boots he was wearing glowed brightly, and he took off again.<br>
<br>
Curses!  Damn the foul creature!  Where did they get this equipment from?  Inevitibly the wood elves and high elves that came within reach of his blade were somehow hastened, through the use of those damnable boots or the spells they cast or the songs they sang.  One day, he would show them.  He would show them all.<br>
<br>
Maybe what was needed was a visit to their own home, a little greeting from him to them.  He chuckled darkly to himself as he watched the pathetic elf vanish into the evening mist of the commonlands.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, a swarm of insects converged upon him from out of nowhere, biting at him, and attempting to get to the blood beneath the ebon skin.  It was irritating, aggravating, annoying, and it downright bloody pissed him off, but he knew enough to hold his anger down and look around for the source of the pests.<br>
<br>
Not there... not there... THERE! <br>
<br>
The voice in the back of his head screamed at him.  NOW!  STRIKE NOW!<br>
<br>
This was only the second time he had heard it, but so far, it's desires and his were one and the same.  He struck.  Knowing that this scourge of pests would eventually bleed him down a bit, he struck with the lifestealing spell, allowing him a few precious moments of relief before the maddening bugs drained the new blood out as well.  More was called for.  He didn't feel like chasing this one down, so he called upon another of his powers, and the diminuitive figure was surrounded by darkness, slowing his steps.<br>
<br>
Shaiith chuckled even as he ran towards his assailant.  Try to take HIM by surprise, eh?  Fine.  He wondered for a moment what the person on the receiving end of a two-handed sword felt right before it cut into him.  His preoccupation was abruptly cut short, as the roots from the short bushes somehow leaped up out of the ground and wrapped arounnd his legs, fastening him firmly and causing a little bit of pain as well.<br>
<br>
Snarling, no longer even slightly amused, he ripped his way out of the grasping roots and hurtled towards his opponent.  Spells, eh?  Well, two could play that.  <br>
<br>
Pausing for a moment, he caused his mind to be filled with sickness and disease, and directed the sensation mentally towards his foe.  The halfling, for so it was, turned decidedly pale and shook his head as if to clear it.  By that time, Shaiith was upon him.<br>
<br>
Almost shrieking his hate, the dark Knight swung the sword in a large arc, slashing deep into the druid's arm.  The druid staggered back a bit, shook his head again, tested the arm for durability, and pulled from his belt a wicked-looking scimitar.  Shaiith stepped back a pace and began another spell.  This small creature had no need for the strength to use said weapon, at least in his eyes, and he could always use more.<br>
<br>
Upon completion of the spell, the halfling weakened a bit, and Shaiith grinned, feeling the weight of the two handed sword grow less in his hand.<br>
<br>
NOW!  STRIKE NOW!<br>
<br>
Again the voice bellowed in his head.  That, he thought, wasn't really necessary, because that was exactly what he was doing.  Even as he thought, the heavy blade went above his head and came screaming down towards the halfling.<br>
<br>
Obviously knowing little of swordplay, the druid put up his blade to attempt to at least cushion the blow.  The steel of the scimitar was not made to take the kind of force that was being dealt, however, and snapped like a twig under the weight of the heavier blade.  The arm underneath, bracing, didn't fare too well either.  As a matter of fact, it was nearly sheared clean off.<br>
<br>
Realizing suddenly (a little late) that he was not as good a swordsman as the dark one, the druid fell back on something he knew.  Magic.  Muttering, gesturing, and pointing at the dark elf, he began to emanate flames from his fingertips.<br>
<br>
     &quot;I don't think so, my boy,&quot;  Shaiith hissed.  &quot;It must be very hard to concentrate with the hilts of a sword shoved where the sun doesn't shine!&quot;  So saying, he drew back to attack again, the voice inside screaming at him to strike NOW, while he was vulnerable.  &quot;Curse you, be silent, I DO know what i'm doing here!&quot;  The halfling paused.  Who had the Tier'dal been speaking to?  Great Mother, not only was he dangerous, he was quite mad as well!<br>
<br>
The delay cost him.  Dearly.  As he watched the dark elf converse with thin air, he forgot in his untimely interest the fact that there was over a full meter of steel headed directly towards his head.<br>
<br>
At least, until it got there.  After that, he didn't have to worry about anything ever again.<br>
<br>
Shaiith thrust the blade into the soft ground a few times to clean the blood off, knocked off a few loose clods of dirt, and proceded to slice the druid's purse strings.  Nothing.  Such cheap bastards.  If they were going to come attack him, they should really hit up the bank before they came.  All the same, his lesson had been learned.  He would certainly be more attentive in the future.  The last of the swarm departed, leaving the Knight of Shadows alone with his thoughts.<br>

Shaiith had noticed the sands starting even before he had arrived at the wide passage that cut through the cliffs.  There had been some noise off to his right as he entered, but he had recognized the presence of undead as par for the course.  He had used one of his new-found powers, and discovered the presence of no less than three ghouls.  Nowhere near as strong as those that guarded his guild's sanctuary, but more than one at a time was probably too much for him.<br>
<br>
Besides, he was headed for other parts, and didn't really have time to stop and play.<br>
<br>
Walking briskly through the tunnel, the slim figure he made casting little shadow in the darkness, Shaiith soon came upon an opening to his right.  He glanced in, and noted the presence of several merchants.  This was odd.  A collection of merchants that didn't seem to dislike him... yet the large hollowed out section of cavern was completely void of anyone except the merchants.  Under any other circumstances, the hawkers would be bawling their wares, trying to be heard over the din of a massive crowd.<br>
<br>
He walked in, and went around to several of the merchants to see what they had in stock.  As he had thought, he found nothing but the basic items.  These merchants hadn't seen a lot of business in a long while, perhaps even never.  It was a shame; it was in a fairly ideal spot, and the merchants looked like they would do business with any and all who stepped into their areas.  <br>
<br>
Walking out, his gaze fell on a shadowy form, right near the entrance.  Something about the figure screamed rascal, yet there was something compelling about him.  Shaiith shrugged.  It would be compelling to someone besides him.  He didn't really care.  At all.<br>
<br>
Continuing down the wide stone corridor, he thought again about what he had to do in Grobb.  What did he have to do?  Nothing, really.  Maybe check out the Knights' chapter there, although it was doubtful they had anything worth anything.  They were, after all just trolls.  He wondered again why the older Knights had wanted him to go.  Maybe just to get him out of their hair.  It made sense.  They thought they were so wonderful, wise beyond belief in their experience.  Hm.  What did they know.  Hells, Grobb didn't even bother keeping back the jungle, from what he had heard.<br>
<br>
Coming to the end of the tunnel, Shaiith wished that he was in the jungle now.  It was hot, and dry, and dry, and hot, and everywhere there was sand.  Not the beach sand that he was used to seeing in the rich houses, this was fine, gritty desert sand  It was so light even a slight breeze could pick it up and deposit it in places one didn't even know existed, let alone be able to hold something that irritating for that long.<br>
<br>
And the sun!  He had never seen the sun so bright.  It glared at him, daring to come out and risk the rays of heat.  Nature was one thing, and then again deific directions were something else entirely.  &quot;That which does not kill me...&quot;<br>
<br>
He took the sun's dare, and stepped out of the tunnel.<br>
<br>
And immediately stepped back into it.  Maybe after nightfall he would cross.<br>
<br>
The day wore on, and the air grew dryer, and the sand grew grittier, and there came a point where Shaiith stopped sweating.  He had sweat all the moisture right out of his body.  And this was in the shade!!  Downing yet another canteen of water, the young dark elf checked his rapidly dwindling supply.  It was time to move, sun or not.  If he stayed here for too long, he would be too far away from another spot for water to make it to alive.  He wondered morbidly how much of a wind it would take to push his dessicated body across the sands like a tumbleweed.<br>
<br>
He hadn't travelled very far at all when he began to smell salt in the air, and began to see trees ahead of the cliff face he was walking by.  As he got closer he realized... there was another entrance to Freeport!  There, looking at him apprehensively, but not doing anything that would be considered a threat to his wellbeing, was a merchant!  Water!  He wouldn't die out here after all.  At least not of thirst.<br>
<br>
His pack now feeling much more satisfyingly heavy, Shaiith walked on, leaving a very relieved looking merchant and two glowering guards behind.  Following the smell of salt, he walked on, until he came to a little outpost that seemed to be made for fishing.<br>
<br>
It was right on the edge of a vast expanse of water, greater than any he had ever seen before.  This must be the ocean the books spoke of.  The voice in the back of his head chuckled at his wonderment.  It was the first he had heard it since his encounter with the halfling.  'Who are you?  WHAT are you?' he said mentally.  He had a good idea, but there were a lot of powers that could do the same.  No response forthcoming, he started down the coast.  <br>
<br>
It was a long, long walk.  All he could see in the distance were dunes, sand, dunes, and more sand.  It didn't really matter too much to him.  Nothing seemed to anymore.  He tried to feel sorry about that, but nothing came.  Nothing at all.  Shaiith shrugged, and continued on his way. <p>Gruuz Grimeyfingurz, Craknek uv da Lex Invictus fambly... pikklez er guud wit cheez.</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub37.ezboard.com/blexinvictus.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=gruuzgrimeyfingurz>GruuzGrimeyfingurz</A> at: 3/6/02 3:22:18 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub37.ezboard.com/unanookt.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nanook T</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ph3aR my witty sig</span><br>  Posts: 316<br> <font color=#70DB93>(3/8/02 6:52:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub37.ezboard.com/flexinvictusfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=51.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Saga Continues: Ro</span><hr size=1> Good stuff Gruuz!

The moon's glow lit the land well enough for travel, and Shaiith decided that from here on out, all traveling would be done in the dark.  It hid him from the eyes of those not fortunate enough to possess night vision, and the sun did not bother him in the slightest when it wasn't in the sky.  He had just settled down for a little meditation, not needing sleep, when he heard a voice crying for help in the distance.<br>
<br>
More curious than anything, he stood and was about to investigate when something niggled the back of his mind.  Not the Voice, not this time, but something else...  Caution?  He wondered at that, but decided to listen to his instincts.  Bowing his head and pulling two small white fragments from his pack, he concentrated, spoke a few words, and dropped the fragments on the ground.  Nothing happened for a few seconds, but suddenly the fragments began to grow.  They elongated and branched, and in the space of a few breaths a skeletal warrior stood before him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Guarding you, Master.&quot;  it said in a voice straight from a crypt.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, I suspected you might,&quot;  the knight said, smiling wryly.  His defense in place, he darted lithely across the desert sands, his minion keeping a careful distance behind him.<br>
<br>
The cries he had heard in the distance were beginning to sound desperate, and he hastened his steps, if only to see the demise.  Cresting a dune, he involuntarily stopped in awe.  A troll, a green creature easily twice his height and many times his weight, was doing battle with a crocodile, such as the ones he had seen moving sluggishly along the coast.  This particular specimen, how ever, was not sluggish in the slightest.  It was also very, very large.  The only thing that had saved the troll so far, it seemed, was the brave fight it was putting up.  The croc's head was so huge, it could have easily swallowed the troll whole.  A name came back to him, from one of the guild's books...<br>
<br>
LockJaw.<br>
<br>
This troll was in trouble, and although LockJaw was wounded in several places, if the warrior didn't receive aid soon, he would become a meal for this vast reptile.  Shaiith thought a moment, then reached into a pocket and pulled out a copper.<br>
<br>
&quot;Heads you're in luck, tails you're lunch.&quot;  The coin spun up into the air.<br>
<br>
Gazing down at the shiny image of one of Neriak's council of elders, the knight shrugged his shoulders.  &quot;I could have sworn that was a double tail coin, but I guess I grabbed the wrong one.  Besides, maybe you can help me get to Grobb.&quot;  Leaving the coin where it lay, Shaiith rushed down the slope, shouting to his minion to attack.<br>
<br>
He paused right before he got to the monstrous beast, which served two purposes.  One, the pet got there before him, and took a little of the brunt of any attacks headed his way.  Two, it gave him time to lay down a mystical offense.  Fearing the monster's great strength, the knight drained it for himself.  Not noting any great discomfort, he wondered briefly what he had gotten himself into, and launched his next attack.  Drawing upon that well of sickness again, he threw it mentally at the beast, and was stunned when it didn't even flinch!  The magic hadn't affected it in the slightest!  Growling in his throat, he drew his sword and launched himself with reptilian strength at his target- the neck.<br>
<br>
He was very glad he had taken the strength when he had, because the damage he did was minimal.  If he hadn't taken it, he likely wouldn't have been able to scratch the surface of the monster's skin.  Muttering in frustration, he attempted to call the sickness again, and met with results this time.<br>
<br>
The result was LockJaw's animosity.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, the troll, seeing assistance, buckled down and started to throw his axe around, causing some serious injuries on the reptile's side.  This drew LockJaw's attention back to the troll, but not before leaving grievous wounds on the dark elf.<br>
<br>
Not really concerned, Shaiith drew again on his power to drain life, healing himself, and deepening some scratches on the monster in the bargain.  He looked at his skeletal warrior, sighed at the fact that it hadn't done ANY damage whatsoever, and then took stock of the situation.  He was surprised when he saw the froth flecking from the trolls lips, and the glazed look in his eyes.  He had reached a state where he knew he was going to die, and didn't care.  If he was going down, then this creature was going down with him.<br>
<br>
Now, that didn't suit Shaiith's purpose at all.  He needed this creature to survive, if only to show him to Grobb.  After that point, the dark elf really didn't care what happened to the smelly warrior.<br>
<br>
The troll started chanting in a foreign language, a warrior's death song in his native tongue, probably.  Shaiith shook his head.  This would not do at all!  The dark knight stood back and gauged his foe's remaining life, and found that there was only one way to defeat the monster before the troll died.  He moved back in, with great sweeps of his sword that the troll would have applauded had he been in any condition.  Shaiith grabbed hold of LockJaw's tail and drove his sword into it, as deeply as it would go.  THAT got the beast's attention.<br>
<br>
Pivoting much more swiftly than anything that size had a right to, Lockjaw snapped at this irritating little creature.  It had a dull form of intelligence, and it recognized that many more blows like that could conceivably cause it serious harm.  So it did what any normal, self-respecting giant crocodilian would do.  It snapped at the thing that had struck from behind it.<br>
<br>
NOW! NOW! NOW! NOW!<br>
<br>
Barely pausing long enough to mutter a sarcastic &quot;No, really?&quot;, Shaiith reached into that now-familiar well of hatred and anger.  As the great jaws came crashing inexorably down, a diminutive fist flew up to meet it.  A hissing whine, a stench of ozone, and a powerful explosion blew the entire top part of the beast's head clean off.  The body did a complete somersault, nearly landing on the still-frothing troll.  The warrior continued to mindlessly hack at the carcass, still chanting, still swinging.<br>
<br>
Shaiith shook his head.  He was going to have to wait for the battle frenzy to wear off.  He looked over at his skeletal minion, who was untouched.  Small wonder, he hadn't caused any damage, why would he have taken any?  The dark elf sighed, and muttered &quot;Back to hell with you!&quot;  The minion bowed its head in submission.<br>
<br>
&quot;As you command, O great one.&quot;  At least it was polite.  Mist began to rise from the bones, and in no time, nothing that remotely looked like a skeleton remained.  Even the footprints began to blow away in the sand.  Shaiith sat down and began to meditate again, confident that anything stupid enough to venture near would go for the raging troll first.<br>

I don't know how much you know about the Bst class, so I'll summarize here.<br>
<br>
Monk/Shaman hybrid.<br>
Monk so far as armor is restricted to leather and h2h/ 1hb is emphasized.  No other nifty monk abilities like FD or Mend.  Gets most Shaman spells later (like SK vs. Necro).  Plenty stat buffs and DoTs, a weak heal, one DD, and some utility spells like SoW, see invis, and summon food/water.  No root though (bleh).  60% of melee damage is pet.  We have pet heals for our own pets that are more efficient than cleric heals (which we need 'cause pet has a LOT of hps).  One of our nastier pet buffs is a 30dd proc that we can change the resistance base of (i.e. magic based proc, cold based proc, fire based...etc.).<br>

&quot;The massive creature crouched down so it was almost the same height as its opponent.  'Joo wuntin phyte, huh? Mee gibz joo phyte!'  The ogre launched himself high into the air, shouting as he flew, 'Fase meez &quot;Mystic Flyin' Bellyflop&quot;!  Meez kung foo iz beddur dan jorz will evver bee!&quot;<br>
