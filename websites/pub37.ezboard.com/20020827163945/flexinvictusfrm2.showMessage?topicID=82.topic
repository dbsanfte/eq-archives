A drunken Male, knight by his look, makes her decision or her as he stumbles against her table. With a fluidity that men cannot hope to match, she rises, catches the rude little snot and casusally shoves him into the glass window of the fish.

For a long moment she sits back, lost in thoughts and memories.  Eventually the reminiscent look turns to a slight smile as she stands and makes her way up to the shadow mistresses quarters.  With barely a sound she makes her way in, the shadows of the dimly lit hall making the dark circles of fatigue under her eyes that much more apparent.  It's obvious that she's lost a bit of weight in the recent moons, clear that more than likely it is due to strain versus vanity.  Spying the sleeping form that rests with fingers on the hilt of her blade, she quietly moves towards her.  Looking down upon her estranged sister, a gentle expression touches her face, and after a long moment, she pulls the covers further up over Vordai, leans down and kisses her temple and makes her way back out, gently shutting the door behind her. <p><CENTER><HR WIDTH=250><FONT COLOR="RED" FACE="ARIAL"><B><I>Cute little cup-cake, baked by the devil!</I></B></FONT><BR><img src="http://www.pbbr.com/test/synnsig.jpg"><br><A HREF="http://synnovea.no-frills.net"><font face="ARIAL">Phasmatis ex Machina</font></a><BR><a href="http://pub37.ezboard.com/blexinvictus"><font face="ARIAL">Lex Invictus Bulletin Board</font></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub37.ezboard.com/unanookt.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nanook T</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ph3aR my witty sig</span><br>  Posts: 569<br> <font color=#70DB93>(4/29/02 6:13:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub37.ezboard.com/flexinvictusfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=82.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Bitch</span><hr size=1> Pooh nudged at his arm to wake him, but it was hardly necessary; he had awoken at first scent of her.  <br><br>With his heart beating an excited rhythm against his chest, Nan silently made his way past those of his family asleep in the great hall.  It would have been a comical sight, an Ogre sneaking about, if not for the fact that no one awoke, and the only sound to be heard was snoring of various degrees.<br><br>Not daring to hope, he started up the stairs.  Before half of their span was behind him, he heard something, just barely.  Straining, holding his breath, he tried to make out the sound.  Footsteps.  Very light.

Explanations would be somewhat awkward..<br><br>The footsteps began their path down the stairs with a slow, even tread.  Step by step, they made their way down.  If a step or two had a slightly different echo to it, the walker made no indication that they had noticed.  Holding tightly underneath their surface, Nannuuk had time to reflect on two distinct thoughts.  First, if he didn't miss his guess, that particular scent belonged to Synnovea.  The Boss was up late again.  She seemed weary as of late.  He worried for her.  Second, he prayed to whatever gods would listen that the stairs would not creak under his weight.  They were sturdily made with Trolls and Ogres in mind, but not actually designed for such beings to hang underneath them.  A third thought slipped through his mind as the footsteps finished their decent and moved on.  How hard would the Rogues of his family laugh at his terribly amateur efforts at hiding?<br><br>Putting all stray thoughts out of his mind for the time being, he pulled himself carefully back atop the steps and, pausing to listen for anything amiss, continued on his way.<br><br>Her door was shut.  He dared not open it.  Gods only knew what he might face should he disturb her at so late an hour without a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> damn</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> good reason.  Instead, he stretched out along the floor and peered through the crack under the door in question.  A skeleton tended the fire as it snapped and crackled in the hearth.  Her belongings were back in their proper places.  Looking over to her bed, his heart leapt.  She was there!  Sleeping peacefully as if she had never left.<br><br>Gathering himself up off the floor, he suppressed the urge to dance a little happy dance and instead moved quickly and quietly back to his corner where Pooh rested his head on his paws.  It would have been the picture of innocence, had his bags not been stacked back together in the wrong order.  <br><br>He was too happy to chastise his treat-stealing compadre however, and settled back into his chair with a contented sigh.<br><br>Things were looking up.<br><br><br>Nan <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub37.ezboard.com/udamgudluken.showPublicProfile?language=EN>damgudluken</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#70DB93>(5/28/02 2:23:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub37.ezboard.com/flexinvictusfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=82.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.angelfire.com/linux/damgudluken/DAMGUD.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Bitch</span><hr size=1> *encourages poohbear to come outside and play*<br><br>HAR HAR HAR!!
