It's the first serious writing i'd done in a while, and you'll probably be able to tell.<br>
<br>
Here goes:  The Twinkbeeter!<br>
<br>
He woke up in the Outpost.  Standing and stretching, yawning as only an ogre can, he quickly broke camp and took stock of his possessions.  Satisfied, he made his way towards the crumbled portion of the wall, where the cliff golem stood.  He sat down next to the huge creature and pulled out his fletching kit.  Ignoring the glowering beast, he turned his gaze out towards the plains of the Overthere.  'I wonder why they called it that,' he thought.  'Simply The Plains would have been better, but since it doesn't look like I'm going to be a part of any naming committees for new and wondrous places anytime soon, I guess it doesn't matter.'  He didn't really feel like finding a group to play with (he still used that term, no matter what Kizmak might say), so he readied the equipment that let him survive on his own the easiest.<br>
<br>
Finishing with the arrows, he stood up.  He was large, and he knew it.  The diminuitive dark elves barely reached half his height, and as for the gnomes and the 'orrible 'obbits he had fought in Nektulos Forest,  he was almost four times their height, and easily twelve times the weight.<br>
<br>
Movement drew his eye to the horizen.  Squinting, he saw the figure of a Sarnak Conscript in the distance.  An evil grin slowly spread over his face.  Sarnaks were, by far, his favorite enemy.  Every time he saw one, he went after it.  Since the Sarnaks went after everyone they saw, it meant a battle everytime he was in the area.<br>
<br>
Rushing out from the wall, he ran by the Sarnak, slamming one meaty hamhand into its forehead as he went.  Momentarily disoriented, the creature just stood there, stunned.  Knowing that it would be after him as soon as it got its bearings, the warrior ran back towards the golem, stopping just out of its patrol area.  Not by any means a coward, he merely liked to have an out.  It tended to increase the survivability of one such as himself, who lacked the healing magics of several of his friends.  It was hard to bandage yourself in the middle of the fight.<br>
<br>
Sure enough, within seconds, the Sarnak shook the stars out of it's eyes and came running after him.  The warrior stopped, turned around, and set himself square.  The result was like a wheeled cart running into a brick wall at high speeds.  The ogre grinned, and slammed the creature again.  The two traded blows for a whie, back and forth.  The sarnak punched its opponent repeatedly, as well as kicking and trying to stun him the same way he had done it.  The warrior grinned at it and shook his head at the continued stupidity of all his opponents.  Didn't they know what they were up against?  He was Gruuz, the Ogre warrior!  He was a Craknek, tutored by Kizmak the Tyrant himself!  He was a member of the Lords of Darkness!  How could this pitiful thing stand a chance?<br>
<br>
After a few minutes of this, the Sarnak began to realize it was outmatched.  It began to hit harder, out of desperation, but all of its blows were in vain.  It couldn't match this massive creature power for power, and began to run.  Gruuz's grin grew even wider, and he gave chase.  The abominable creature had actually hurt him, and he was determined that it wouldn't live to come harass him again.  The Sarnak ran slower and slower, staggering under repeated blows from the massive two-handed sword.  Soon, it was merely crawling.  Then the only movement that was left was the twitching.  Gruuz's grin faded as he realized just how hurt he was.  Ever the opportunist, he searched the body for any hidden pouches.  Behind the breastplate he found a small topaz and a few gold.  'Not bad at all,' he thought.  <br>
<br>
Returning to the wall, he sat and began to meditate in the way that Kizmak had showed him, to heal his wounds a little faster, and without scars.  He was only doing this for a while when  he heard a voice at his side.  &quot;What rank are you, warrior?&quot;<br>
<br>
Opening his eyes, he turned his head to see a small dark elf standing there, which meant he was even with Gruuz's head as he sat.  &quot;Meez beez ub da twenny-sekkund rank Craknek,&quot; he said.  The 'ogre' vocabulary he brought back out when someone he didn't know met him.  He found people thought him stupid, which usually worked to his aid and/or their demise, whichever he preferred.  &quot;Wye, wut joo wuntin iz?&quot;<br>
<br>
The dark elf gave a satisfied smirk.  &quot;Good,&quot; he said, &quot;I am of the twenty-first rank in my...guild.  Would you care to duel?&quot;  As he spoke, he stroked his shining armor almost lovingly.  Gruuz noticed that it was a little fine for such a rogue of the rank this one had stated.  The ogre accent was gone immediately.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm hurt.  Do you not see my wounds?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, pish, come to the bank with me.&quot;  The dark elf walked off a ways.  &quot;By the way, my name is Sneakr, what's yours?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Gruuz,&quot;  said he as he climbed laboriously to his feet,  &quot;Gruuz Grimeyfingurz.  What is in the bank?&quot;<br>
<br>
The dark elf laughed.  &quot;Healers, you silly lump!&quot;<br>
<br>
Gruuz began to think that maybe shutting this arrogant one's mouth would be a good thing after all.  Maybe the too-fine gear this one had would provide him with a minute or two of amusement.<br>
<br>
In the bank, the elf imperiously hailed a troll shaman.  &quot;You, there, heal this one for me!&quot;<br>
<br>
Gruuz looked at the Shaman, and smiled a little.  &quot;If it's not too much trouble, could you heal me so i could shut this yapping creature's mouth?&quot;<br>
<br>
The troll smiled, and wordlessly began casting spells of healing.  Sneakr affected not to notice the exchange.<br>
<br>
Gruuz watched his body's wounds begin to mend under the healing powers of the shaman, and looked over at the still-smiling elf.  &quot;I'll meet you outside, by the wall.  Don't run off now.&quot;  Sneakr gasped at the audacity of the words, but nodded his agreement and left the building.  Gruuz stretched the kinks that magical healing always seemed to put into his muscles out, and went to the small mechanical banker.  Dropping off anything that might weigh him down, he pulled out the langseax he had bought earlier, as well as the Brazen Brass Kilij that Wobb had given him earlier.  An heirloom, he had said, and now it was being put to use.<br>
<br>
Walking outside the outpost, he looked around for Sneakr, and found him off to the left of the gap.  &quot;Ready?&quot; asked the dark elf.  Gruuz simply nodded.  He had noticed the usual arrogant smirk was gone, replaced with a frown of concentration.  Maybe this would be a challenge, after all.<br>
<br>
Gruuz set his feet, the same way he had with the sarnak.  Sneakr, opposite, merely pulled out one of his blades and began rubbing a wet, earthy-smelling cloth on it.  Gruuz stood patiently, waiting for the battle to begin.  The Jitters that he always got when he began a duel with another intelligent creature dissapated.  He was ready for anything.  Anything, that is, but what happened.  The elf suddenly ran at him, and this he expected.  What he hadn't was when the elf, instead of running into him at full speed (the way everything else seemed to want to), ran BY him, stopping only long enough to jab with both weapons at his back.  In that short amount of time, Three attacks were made.  One came from Gruuz, and did a fair amount of damage...or so it seemed.  It was almost like this tiny dark elf was as durable as he himself was!  The other two attacks came from Sneakr.  One was the usual blade hitting flesh.  Gruuz was used to that.  The wound began to tingle, and the ground around Gruuz feet began to writhe with the undulations of roots, coming from underground, entwining his feet!  Gruuz chuckled at the feeble attempt, and jumped once.  His humongous Bronze-covered feet slammed into the ground, crushing the roots before they had a chance to grasp.  (/ooc You resist the Root spell.)<br>
<br>
Gruuz glanced up from the ground just as Sneakr ran by.  Onetwothree, the dark elf's blades began poking small holes into the ogre's armor, and the elf kept running.  Gruuz tried a swipe, but missed completely.<br>
<br>
Gruuz turned to face his opponent, but for some reason he couldn't see him.  Gruuz spun an abrupt 180 degree turn, scanning the whole while.  He felt a tingling in his wrist, and he felt more agile.  Glancing at his wrist, he saw the serpentine bracer pulse with almost a life of its own.  The ogre grinned, showing his massive teeth.  He may not be quite as agile as the wily dark elf, but now he was a little closer.<br>
<br>
Suddenly he felt a pain in his back, right near his spine, and another one near his kidney.  The miserable creature had stabbed him in the back!  No mercy for this one, who had not honor enough to fight face to face!  Granted, in a face to face slugfest, the frail Tier'dal wouldn't stand a chance, but he had challenged, had he not?  He should have had the guts to stay in view and fight like a warrior.<br>
<br>
Gruuz caught a glimpse of movement out of the corner of his eye, and instictively spun, his massive sword whirling like a windstorm.  Twice he slashed at Sneakr, and twice connected.  As the first strike hit, Gruuz felt a jolt run up his arms.  As the second strike landed, the huge sword glowed a green color, and Gruuz was surrounded by a shield of thistles.  He would have stopped to ponder this, but he was otherwise occupied at the moment.  <br>
<br>
Gruuz realized this shield was the magical effect of the sword, and knew that he needed to be able to attack faster if he wanted to do significant damage to Sneakr.  The dark elf's durability was truly amazing.  Sheathing the two handed sword, he reached for and drew the Kilij and the Langseax he had gotten earlier.  No longer grinning, he spun with elephantine grace and faced his opponent square once more.<br>
<br>
Sneakr charged in, spinning a complex weave of blades.  Gruuz, schooled in almost all blade styles, knew that the dark elf would connect with that particular maneuver, so he spun his blades in his own routine.  Sneakr ran by again, and this time Gruuz matched him blow for blow, and with the addition of the strength all ogres have to boot.  Sneakr winced, but didn't run.  Trying to figure out why while he was capitalizing on the fact, Gruuz realized that he had smashed the elf in the back of the head, and was trying to make the world stop spinning.  Four more hits slammed home as Gruuz poured everything he had into the remainder of the fight.  <br>
<br>
Sneakr, by now weakened and wounded in many places, knew he could not outrun this machine-like opponent that faced him.  The Tier'dal did the only thing left...he tried to take Gruuz to death's embrace with him.  Gruuz grinned once more as he sensed victory.  This arrogant, overstuffed, overdressed little birdie would never bother anyone with honor ever again.  He would make sure of that.<br>
<br>
Three strokes ended the battle.  The first was a backhanded smack that nearly crushed the dark elf's skull.  The second was a slash with his Langseax that cut the elf's neck nearly halfway through.  Still he stood.  Gruuz, however, was determined that his next stroke would finish what this fop had started.<br>
<br>
...WHACK!...  The Brazen Brass Kilij almost shouted in triumph as it drove the rest of the way through the black and red collar around the Tier'dal's neck.  The dark elf, amazingly, blinked twice.  Then his head fell off his shoulders.<br>
<br>
The audience that had somehow grew during the fight instantly began cheering.  'hmmm,' Gruuz thought, 'looks like I wasn't the only one who thought this one needed eliminated.'  &quot;Dankiez, ebberbuddi!  Meez appershiaytz all da clappin an stuffz, but it warn't nuttin!&quot;  Smiling and waving to the crowd, Gruuz went back under the shadow of the cliff golem and leaned up against the wall.  He was hurt, badly... Time to take a break.<br>
<br>
