This NPC is a rare spawn so don't be discouraged if he is not there the first few times you check for them. <br><br>Do not worry if you are KOS at the fort. Kurron spawns near the docks and you will be able to swim or invis yourself to get to him. He is also far enough away from other NPC's that you do not have to worry about them aggroing you when you are there.<br><br>If you ask him what he seeks(do not ask him what his mission is or he will attack you) and then agree to his terms(tell him &quot;I agree&quot;) then he will tell you that he seeks three pieces of darkforge armor(helm, chest and leggings) and 900pp. <br><br>Before turning in these items you need to gather up a good party and have them accompany you. Two groups would be best. <br><br>Handing these items in to him will simply gain a raise in TrueSpirit faction and he will say that his mission is nearly complete. He will reward you with no items. If you ask him what mission he will tell you of his treachery and then attack you.<br><br>At this point you must kill him. Upon killing him you will find a &quot;Note to Duriek&quot; on his corpse. You will need this for the next portion of the quest.<br><br>NOTE: You MUST first hand in these items or he will not drop the note. This has been tested and confirmed.<br><br>Duriek can be found overlooking the newbie area in Paineel. He is upstairs in the newbie area looking out through the glass. If you hand him the note he will tell you a story of his apprentice. He will also tell you to &quot;take this for your efforts.&quot; but no item will be given. I'm not sure if this is broken or not. I have contacted Verant about it with no response. Someone has told me that Verant responded to this on a public board saying that no item is supposed to be given but I was never able to find the thread. Either way you receive TrueSpirit faction and are able to continue the quest.<br><br>If you ask him &quot;What apprentice?&quot; he will give you further background. Tell him that you will take his apprentice's place and he will ask you to prove your worth first. Duriek is aging and is in need of a cough elixir. This is obtained via a side quest in Neriak.  <br><br>Side quest in Neriak: An ogre NPC named Smaka in the Neriak Foreign Quarter can make special cures. One of these includes a bottle of cough elixir which is required in the SK Epic Quest. For a mere 1000pp he will create you some cough elixir. <br><br>Upon returning the cough elixir to Duriek he will inform you that he was trying to create a corrupted ghoulbane. Unfortunately he is no condition to gather the components. His previous apprentice was searching for them when he met his demise. <br><br>He needs you to find a tome for him. This tome can be found in The Hole on Ratman Guards. The best place to find these guards is by taking a left upon entering the first fortress and then take another left and pass down past the pool. Between this area and the old city beneath it Ratman Guards spawn fairly commonly as patrollers. <br><br>Beware that these rats are extremely tough. They hit for 370s, are very magic resistant and have a ton of hit points. The tome is a rare drop on them so you are likely going to have to kill several of them to obtain one. Our first encounter with one we had 7 people and no deaths but we had a high level party and Turgur's stuck on the first attempt. In later raids we had as many as 25 people and might lose 5-8 people each attempt. A lot of it depends on if you can get Turgurs or another speed reducing spell to stick early.<br><br>Handing the Tome to Duriek will grant another faction adjustment and will reveal what items he will need to complete the corrupted ghoulbane. He requires:<br><br>1) Blade of Abrogation from the Plane of Air<br>2) Soul Leech from Cazic Thule in the Plane of Fear (OWCH!)<br>3) Ghoulbane from upper guk (rare drop from the Shin Lord). <br>4) Decrepit Sheath from a Qeynos side quest.<br><br>Qeynos side quest: This sub-quest beings at an NPC named Teydar in the Qeynos Sewers. He spawns in the middle of the Blood Sabers lair so this may require some faction raising by ogres or trolls in order to not be killed on sight here. <br><br>Teydar can create you a decrepit sheath but he requires a few items.<br><br>1) Decrepit Hide(These can be found off Ashenbone Drakes in the Plane of Hate).<br>2) Drake Spine(This can be found on a level 55 rare spawn drake named Rharzar in Rathe Mountains)<br>3) Enchanted Platinum Bar<br><br>Returning him these items will result in a decrepit sheath. <br><br>Returning this items to him will result in a corrupted ghoulbane(dmg 16 delay 34 effect dismiss undead sk only 1hslash) and will send you to seek out Lhranc in the City of Mist. This item is not much use to a shadowknight of this level but it is required for the next portion of the quest.<br><br>Lhranc spawns approximately at location 0,0 in the City of Mist. This is just before the Reaver area near the large hut with all of the Goos. He spawns in the middle hut right past the big goo house. He spawns at the bottom and the two NPC's who spawn upstairs are not placeholders. Upon speaking with him he will reveal what he needs to forge your weapon.<br><br>Each of these steps is accomplished by completing a sub-quest. These sub-quests all tie in together. The heart of an innocent and the will of innoruuk are wearable items that are among the best that  shadowknight can attain. They are listed in the neccessary order of completion.<br><br>Heart of an Innocent: This sub-quest beings with an NPC named Knarthenne Skurle in the Tox Forest. This NPC spawns near the docks. <br><br>Hailing him will result in him telling you that you do not have the heart of an innocent.<br><br>If you have sufficient TrueSpirit faction you can inquire what heart of an innocent. He will then give you a soulcase(2 slot container). He informs you to combine the soulcase with the heart of one who is pure. &quot;If your hand is steady and your mind is clear then you will have what you seek.&quot;<br><br>There is an NPC in the Hole by the name of Caradorn who can help you with this. He can be found in the jail area. For those who are newbies to The Hole, if you go inside of the fortress (down in the pit area) and take a quick left you will come to a T intersection at the end of a long hallway. Going left will lead you to the pool and beyond. Going right will take you down a winding corridor. At the bottom of the corridor is the jail area. There are some ratman patrollers so be ready for a fight. Caradorn spawns in one of the cells.<br><br>There is a whole line of background story here which we will completely cut out and simply explain to you how to complete the quest. To make a long story short Caradorn needs you to find the key to his cell to release him.<br><br>This key can be found on Mimics which are also in the Hole. They are past a secret door in the bank. The key is a rare drop so be prepared to kill a few of them before attaining it.<br><br>Be sure to have a good amount of backup before handing the key in to Caradorn. Upon turning the key in to him Kyrenna will spawn and they will both attack you. You should be safe with two parties but one party can probably defeat them as well if it is well balanced and experienced.<br><br>On Kyrenna's corpse you will find the Blood of Kyrenna and the Heart of Kyrenna. Place the heart in to the soulcase and hit combine and you will now have the heart of an innocent.<br><br>The blood is required for the Will of Innoruuk and subsequently the Head of the Valiant quests. <br><br>The Will of Innoruuk: This sub-quest will result in the Will of Innoruuk. This is arguably the second best (pre-Velious) breastplate in the game for shadowknights. It is part of the Shadowknight Epic Quest but can also be worn rather than turned in. <br><br>This sub-quest begins at Marl Kastane in Kerra Ridge. He spawns in a hut near the main town area in Kerra. It is important to note here that there appear to be two spawns of Marl Kastane. You can tell which Marl is which by asking him, &quot;what prophecy&quot;.<br><br>The first Marl will ask you to deliver a letter to his brother Gerot Kastane in Paineel. Delivering this item to Gerot will grant you a second item which must be returned to Marl. This appears to be important for two reasons.<br><br>1) It gives you faction to continue on the quest.<br>2) It spawns the second version of Marl Kastane.<br><br>The second Marl will respond to the keywords &quot;what prophecy&quot; by giving you a background story on Glohnor and Lhranc. Tell him that you will complete the ritual and he will inform you that he will need to create a dark shroud. To do this he will need the blood of an innocent. This can be attained by killing Kyrenna which is documented in the Heart of an Innocent sub-quest.<br><br>After handing the blood of Kyrenna to Marl you will receive a dark shroud and directions to hand this item to the Ghost of Glohnor in The Hole. <br><br>Handing the shroud to Glohnor's ghost will cause a Mummy of Glohnor to spawn. This mummy is extremely tough so make sure you bring multiple parties to help in the task. <br><br>Killing him will result in two items. The mummy wrappings of Glohnor and the head of Glohnor. The head is used for the Head of the Valiant sub-quest. <br><br>The wrappings are to be returned to Marl. You should ask &quot;what prophecy&quot; to make sure that it is the second version of Marl and not the first. It remains to be seen if the first version will simply eat your items or if he will reward you properly but I would not take any chances at this point. Handing in the mummy wrappings will result in the Will of Innoruuk.<br><br>Head of the Valiant: This sub-quest beings with an NPC named Gerot Kastane in Paineel. He will not speak to you unless you have sufficient TrueSpirit faction. <br><br>If you have sufficiently proven yourself he will reveal to you everything that he knows about the head of the valiant. He tells you that he can create this item. All that he requires is the head of a valiant warrior. Unfortunately he gives you no clues as to where to find this valiant warrior. <br><br>The head of the valiant will be gained by defeating the mummified Glohnor. Complete details are described in the Will of Innoruuk sub-quest. Turn the head of Glohnor in to Gerot and you will receive the Head of the Valiant, a very nice earring.<br><br>Return these three items along with the corrupted ghoulbane to Lhranc and he will reward you by turning in to a living version of himself wielding the almighty Innoruuk's Curse. Killing him will allow you to loot the weapon.<br><br>NAAASTY quest...but the reward is incredible...have a peek...<br><br>Innoruuk's Curse<br>MAGIC ITEM   LORE ITEM   NO DROP<br>Skill: 2H Slash   <br>DMG: 40<br>Atk Delay: 45<br>STR: +20   DEX: +15   HP: +60   SV FIRE: +10   SV DISEASE: +5   SV COLD: +10   SV MAGIC: +15   SV POISON: +5   <br>Effect: Soul Consumption (250-pt lifetap DoT)<br>WT: 5 <br>Class: SHD  <br>Race: HUM ERU DEF TRL OGR IKS  <br>MOB: Shadowknight epic quest<br>Damage Ratio: 0.89<br>Weapon Power: 8.89<br>Power Per Pound: 1.78<br>Damage Per Second: 18.22<br>Damage Per Second Per Pound: 3.64<br><br>This will be fun to try and attempt eventually...I've come across Rharzar before and he's a pain in the arse to kill! HYPER-quick, hits in the upper 200s-300s and can heal himself. The ghoulbane camp is a LOOOOONG one, usually, as the Shin Lord is a rare spawn and the GB is a rare drop. It's not especially hard, just long and boring. And The Hole? We've all heard the stories...and the fact that it's in lighty territory makes it all the more rough to try and do!<br><br>Veldruk Naeramarth N'Guruthos<br>Shadow Knight in the service of Lord Innoruuk<br><br> <p><CENTER><HR WIDTH=250><FONT COLOR="RED" FACE="ARIAL"><B><I>Cute little cup-cake, baked by the devil!</I></B></FONT><BR><img src="http://www.pbbr.com/test/synnsig.jpg"><br><A HREF="http://synnovea.no-frills.net"><font face="ARIAL">Phasmatis ex Machina</font></a><BR><a href="http://pub78.ezboard.com/bsansplace1476"><font face="ARIAL">Lex Invictus Bulletin Board</font></a></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub37.ezboard.com/flexinvictusfrm15.showPrevMessage?topicID=14.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub37.ezboard.com/flexinvictusfrm15.showNextMessage?topicID=14.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub37.ezboard.com/flexinvictusfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14.topic><img src=http://synnovea.no-frills.net/ezboard/reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub37.ezboard.com/flexinvictusfrm15.threadControl?topicID=14.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub37.ezboard.com/flexinvictusfrm15.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=14.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub37.ezboard.com/flexinvictusfrm15.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=14.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub37.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="lexinvictusfrm6">The Courtyard<option value="lexinvictusfrm2">Storytellers Circle<option value="lexinvictusfrm3">About Lex Invictus<option value="lexinvictusfrm4">Seeking Membership<option value="lexinvictusfrm1">The Great Hall<option value="lexinvictusfrm8">Raiding and Guild Events<option value="lexinvictusfrm7">Guild Coffers and Spoils<option value="lexinvictusfrm9">Guild Policy Discussion<option value="lexinvictusfrm10">The Round Table<option value="lexinvictusfrm15">The Library<option value="lexinvictusfrm5">The Real World - OOC<option value="lexinvictusfrm11">Guild Membership Review<option value="lexinvictusfrm14">The Art of War<option value="lexinvictusfrm12">Guild Archives<option value="lexinvictusfrm16">Access Request<option value="lexinvictusfrm17">The Council Chambers<option value="lexinvictusfrm18">Trophy Room</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#70DB93>- </font><a href=http://pub37.ezboard.com/blexinvictus>Lex Invictus</a><font color=#70DB93> - </font><a href=http://pub37.ezboard.com/flexinvictusfrm15>The Library</a> <font color=#70DB93> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.4.6<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
