<br>
I've been browsing through some old notes, prints, etc. from about a year ago, when I started playing this game.<br>
In that period I joined Ruta, at level 14, was invited on 2 september 2001, by Cyrella who was kind enough to come all the way over from some far away place with the ominous name "The Great Divide" (the ability to Gate to other places than your own bindpoint, like gating to West Commons? I had never heard of it). Browsing through those notes, it's odd how many people I regularly teamed with back then who have totally disappeared from my radar.<br>
<br>
A lot has happened since. Mehail and Grimthorn organized some raids back then where us newbies were able to totally control mortal zones like Unrest and Mistmoore, thanks to the kind help of a few level 50 bodyguards. Later on, I could help with Voxie, when Lyrax organized that terribly hectic zergfest with level 60 cleric support (thanks again for all the rezzes Grimmy!). And of course we goofed about a bit in the Rygorr fort in EW, Scarlet Desert (show me one more Bloodtribe and I'm gonna scream), had a little picnic in the Grey, and were annihilated several times in Fear. The most fun I got from Ruta, however, was guildchat. The crazy dialogues in there had me sometimes laughing till my side hurt. <br>
And, of course, I hit 60 2 weeks ago.<br>
<br>
Well, this wouldn't be a post of mine if there wasn't some venting in it, would it?<br>
So here we go<br>
<br>
/venting<br>
Since hitting 60, the enjoyment of playing EQ has dropped dramatically. For starters, it appears to be totally acceptable to call a level 60 a bitch or worse, when she doesn't respond positively to the request to "spare a few items plz"/gate over from Lesser Faydark to Thurgadin to port someone to DL/give up the camp I've been holding for over an hour without someone else in the zone/whatever someone can possibly demand from another player. I'm being insulted on a daily basis for my desire to play the game the way I always played it. <br>
<br>
But, there is also the plus side to that nice shiny level, is there? You can join all kinds of cool raids, get PH4T L3WTZ, and as a wizard you can join AE teams on a 24/7 basis, right?<br>
Wrong. Let me tell you guys one thing about AE teams: there are 2 regular camps on this entire server. Total wizards needed: 6. On peak hours there are at least 2 dozen level 60 wizards online, all of them dying for a spot in one of those 2 teams. You do the math.<br>
As for those raids: yes, once every 2 weeks or so, I get a tell from someone if I want to join a ToV-raid/Hate-raid/whatever. Problem is however, that the guilds that need more wizards for that raid, usually have a reason for not having enough wizards for that raid. Bad reputation as a guild, for example, quite often a deserved one.. The cool guilds? With a good reputation? Since they have such a good rep they already have enough wizards for that raid, and frankly, having someone extra tag along for one single raid, having to explain them all things, how to do this or that zone or mob is simply extra hassle. The extra nukes? Well, since they were already capable of killing that critter... <br>
It's a bit of a Catch-22 thing really.<br>
/end venting<br>
<br>
So there you have it. I'm stuck. A few days ago, I even started an alt. Yes, you heard it right: Me, Etelka, started an alt! Name is Etel by the way, she's a level 5 DE enchanter and cute. But those of you who know me will recognize that me starting an alt is a sign of a serious depression. <br>
Right now I have several options: <br>
* Switch to playing my chanter and level her up. If I do this, a few months from now I will look at my character list, see Etelka, know that she could be killing dragons, log on Etel and go kill goblins in High Hold Keep.<br>
* Delevel Etelka to 59 to get rid of the whining and start working on quests or so. Although this would be the most original solution, it is not really "me", for starters: I simply don't have the patience for most quests.<br>
* Guess what? Yup, switch guilds. There are a lot of reasons to play this game. You have the social side, the exploring side (having seen every zone for example), the loot side (never really understood that one), the sensation side (WOW I can't believe we actually killed him!), etcetera. For me, the most important one is that sensation. If I don't have that thrill once every one or 2 weeks I am an unhappy wizzy.<br>
<br>
So I had a chat with Herbert yesterday. Since quite a few (new and old) friends of mine are in Pravus Mortis, I was kinda interested in joining a few of their raids on a sort of free-lance basis. But as Pravus is not really interested in people joining their raids on a free-lance basis.. Well... I might as well take the big step. <br>
I always loved to team up with the people I know in Pravus and they seem to be interested in an extra wizzy, so I'm probably entering one of those uncomfy Eval periods, in which we're gonna decide, as the saying goes, "If the guild fits me, and if I fit the guild".<br>
<br>
As much as I hate it, I am going to /guildremove Etelka sometime today, and wanted to tell you I am proud to have been a rutabaga this last year. I really hope this change of guildtag does not affect the friendship we built, and please, whenever you need some firepower, do not forget that arrogant little wizzy!<br>
<br>
The best of luck to all of you,<br>

<br>
Make and alt and get him guilded into RP so you can come back for a refreshing bout of guild chat when the mood strikes ya. (and it will)<br>
<br>
Raids sometimes &quot;go bad&quot;.  (Wipeouts, etc)  Don't let it get to you, and think of it as a learning experience.  Part of the fun of taking out uber mobs is &quot;figuring them out&quot;.  Nobody gets it right the first time.<br>
<br>
Make sure Herbie uses SOAP when he takes a bath.  He'll sometimes fib and tell you he did when he didn't. (Check behind the ears too...)<br>
<br>
Pravus Mortis is a GREAT bunch of folks with quite a few Rutas in the guild. (Herbie, Ahjess, and formerly ME)  I think you'll enjoy it.  My own reasons for leaving PM and joining Hoss had more to do with not wanting to build a guild again. (I've tried that in the past and it drove me nuts)  You could do a LOT worse than PM.<br>
