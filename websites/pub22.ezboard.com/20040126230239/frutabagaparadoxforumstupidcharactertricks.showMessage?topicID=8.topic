You see the big critters in front of you whacking everyone in sight, the red bars are almost seeming to fly to nothing.  And you have the decision to make &quot;Do I run or fight?&quot;<br>
<br>
I think I've gotten better at judging this, but what do you all think?  Is running when you feel you have helpless odds a wise move or cowardice of the worst degree?  As I get higher, the pain of losing literally hours of play gets worse, yet I still feel the obligation to not let a single group member die.<br>
<br>
And even if you decide to run, and smack that hot button that yells to the group and the zone that you're taking to your heals, invariably, you get Hero Complex and look back and stop to see if your fellow group mates are following.  And of course, that is when you see the critters smack you, stun or root you, and you're now too weak to make it to zone and you're dead.  And then your group mates stop to see if you're going to make it, and they get hit.  And so on.  hehe.  And that little routine I do think is a bit silly, but even so, it is hard to resist doing. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=660066><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub22.ezboard.com/ualihjazanzibar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Alihja Zanzibar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>ezOP</span><br>  Posts: 45<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(9/19/00 5:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub22.ezboard.com/frutabagaparadoxforumstupidcharactertricks.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hero or fool</span><hr size=1> Ephie and I come to this sometimes.

I remember one situation when we were in Guk, there were too many froggies for Kras to keep mezzed.  They were all beating on Mehail, who was trying to cast an Evac.  Eph and I started meleeing the frogs to draw their attention from him, so that he could get the spell off.  We all got out alive. <br>
<br>
People dying, it happens, but as a cleric, I feel responsible for my party's lives.<br>
<br>
IMHO, I think they made ress spells to make the cleric feel better about a party member dying.<br>

I've only been in this situation a few times, (being a necro, some people don't want to group with you).  I've tried being the last to run,  I've found 2 great spells that work in a run situation.  Engulfing Darkness and Fear.  <br>
<br>
When I see the others start running I usually have nothing on me at that moment so I target the mob's on my group mates to either slow the mobs down or scare them off.  Then when I can't do anymore I then exit zone left.<br>

Big issues. I've seen too many pulls gone awry, and its jus sad. I was actually talking to Liddlerunt about this a couple of days ago, IRL, and now I see it on here. I'll explain my biggest pet peeve.<br>
<br>
When mobs are overpulled. Instead of getting the 1 skel you wanted, you get all 4, and the group starts nuking, frying, and otherwise wading into the agro path of every pulled mob. <br>
<br>
Ridiculous, I firmly believe that its the puller's job to tell the group when to zone. A puller has to know what his group is capable of. A puller has to know WHEN to say &quot;RUN&quot;, and a puller has to run last of all, unless he's trying to drag as many mobs with his beaten body to the zone line, when a zone line is near. <br>
<br>
I believe only a puller, and healer should be allowed to call a &quot;RUN&quot; and its disturbing when another group member says &quot;ZONE IT!!&quot; thinking the mob is out of control. If the puller / main tank has it under control, stick around. If they say &quot;ZONE&quot;, please please run for the zone. I can't tell you HOW awful it is when groups don't listen to the &quot;Zone&quot; caller. <br>
<br>
anyway, this is turning into a bit of a rant.<br>
Listen to the puller, they know (or at least they SHOULD know) what the group's capable of. Zone when told to zone, and do it only when told to zone, by someone who is either a main tank, or a healer.  Don't be a chicken, its the puller who's got the longest run ahead of them if they die. hehe.  I'll be trying to taunt the mob off you until the last second, so you'd better be making an effort to zone out of there.<br>

Usually, I'm the puller or the healer, so I'm not worrying about being the one to call Run.<br>
<br>
And personally, I think the healer should be the last one out.  Usually they have other ways of making it out.  Clerics have their immunity spell.  Druids and Shamans always have SOW on.  And all of 'em can gate.  And often times they can heal the tanks as run out.  Plus, a caster dieing only sets the group back a few minutes as they re-mem their spells and loot their corpse.  Often if a tank dies, the group is set back for 15-30 minutes as the tank runs back from the nearest city.<br>
<br>
And when I say run, everyone better dang well run!  ;^P  Because I am, and while I may stop if a mob isn't on me to toss a heal your way, or do a root or snare, if I have a mob on me I'm doing every trick I know of to get to the zone as fast as possible. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=660066><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub22.ezboard.com/ualihjazanzibar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Alihja Zanzibar</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.geocities.com/rutabaga_paradox/vegicon.jpg BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Den Mother</span><br>  Posts: 149<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(2/18/01 10:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub22.ezboard.com/frutabagaparadoxforumstupidcharactertricks.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/rutabaga_paradox/aliface.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hero or fool</span><hr size=1> Well, usually before we are headed into a dangerous situation, (I say &quot;we&quot; because it's always Kras, Alihja, Esch, Eph, and sometimes Giledena or Mehail) Eschatus will memorize an evac.  If we are taking on a tough MOB that hits hard and fast, it can tear through my mana faster if it gets aggroed on those casters.  So, if I end up with 2 mana left and it's not at half hitpoints yet....  I have to call the wizard to evac.  If the wizard is the caster that the MOB is beating on, usually, my mana goes into healing the wizard to take the MOBS off of him and onto me to he can gate us out.<br>
<br>
Divine Aura/Barrier are a last resort for me.  I can't cast my divine (invulnerability) line if we are evacing because it makes me invulnerable to teleports and evacs.  I usually cast it if I'm being beat down hard and fast and need to give the group time to get control of the situation.  I have to type: &quot;DIVINED&quot;.  During this time while I'm divined, I can't do anything.  No casting, no healing....  I can't be healed during this time either.  It sometimes lets me sit down and med if the warrior can taunt the thing off of me.  Or, if there is no wizard and we have to run for the zone, it gives me about 18 seconds to do it.  I almost never have to use it, but it's always memmed.<br>
<br>
Since celestial healing was released with Velious (the gradual 720 hitpoint heal at 25 points per tick) I rarely get aggroed on anymore.  ... except unless those darn casters get hit, I tell you! <p>Alihja Zanzibar <br>

Hehe.  That's why I didn't think of it Ali when we were getting beat upon by brownie scouts.  I so often can't use 'em that I just don't think of them.<br>
<br>
I do try to keep SOW on every single person, so they at least have a sporting chance though.  I keep them on my cycle, so if SOW starts to go, it goes on me first.  I've also gotten good at healing fast enough so it agro's on me.

And make sure the evil's know that they need to back away ASAP. And by the way you will ALWAYS zone in facing the ring.
