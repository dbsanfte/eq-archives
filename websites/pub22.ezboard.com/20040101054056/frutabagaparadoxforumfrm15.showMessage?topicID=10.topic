Poke.<br>
<br>
Pause.<br>
<br>
Poke.<br>
<br>
“Mmph…”, I muttered.<br>
<br>
Poke.<br>
<br>
I finally opened my eyes.  Goobr was crouched in front of me, poking me in the middle of my forehead with one long skeletal finger.<br>
<br>
“What?” I grumbled, sitting up. <br>
 <br>
“You fell asleep again,” he said in that hoarse, whispery voice of his.  <br>
<br>
“Duh. Of course I did.  So what?”  I rubbed my eyes and rummaged around next to me on the ground – bait, tackle box… where the hell was my fishing pole?  “Where the hell is my fishing pole?”<br>
<br>
Goobr snickered and pointed out into the Karana river.  “Dumbass.  You caught something, but you were asleep.”  He snickered some more.<br>
  <br>
Well, crap.  That was my last one, and the nearest place to get another was a gate back home.  I stood and stared in mild frustration at the rest of my fishing gear, willing a pole to appear out of nowhere.  No dice.  There was a magic tackle box that would do that, I had heard, but I sure as hell didn’t have one yet.  I sat back down and quietly cussed a little.<br>
<br>
Goobr poked me again, in the shoulder.  “C’mon.  Let’s go back and kill ‘em some more if you can’t fish.”<br>
<br>
Something in the tone of his voice made me turn around and stare at him.  He just stood there, grinning at me, same as always.  “Waaait a second,” I said.  “You threw my pole in there while I was asleep, didn’t you?”<br>
<br>
Goobr just laughed.<br>
<br>
“I oughta gate out and let you rot, you little…”<br>
<br>
Goobr laughed louder. “Go ahead, Nkai.  You’ll be back.”  He poked me again.  “Days a’wasting.  Let’s go get ‘em.  You’re all better, I’m all better, let’s go.”<br>
<br>
I sighed and started to gather up my gear.  He was right, of course, and it wouldn’t matter to him at all if I gated out and left him.  I’ve called up hundreds of skeletal servants, each created from bone and magic, each one a bit different… but every single one of them animated by the same smart-assed spirit.  Lucky me.  Leaving him, which would banish his spirit, and calling him back later would be like giving him a little nap.<br>
  <br>
“Fine, fine,” I grumped.  “We’ll go back.”  I put my cap back on, grabbed my gear, and headed back up the hill onto the plains of South Karana.  Goobr followed, chuckling softly under his breath.  Well, he doesn’t breathe – but you know what I mean.<br>
<br>
We had been killing treants all day, and having fairly good success at it.  Since I had gotten a few new spells last week, the treants didn’t kick our asses nearly as hard as they used to.  A couple days ago I’d told a druid friend of mine what I had been up to in the plains, and she just about fainted.  I didn’t get it.  They’re just cranky trees, and what’s wrong with cutting down a tree or two?  It made Goobr happy, and it made me a little money and a chance to practice some of my new spells.   They still sometimes pounded on us, though, and we had spent most of the day down by the river, fishing and recovering from our little battles.<br>
  <br>
Goobr giggled when they came into view and cracked his knuckles.  As usual they didn’t see us as we approached; they were too busy worshipping the sun, or whatever tree-y weirdness it is that they do, with their branches stretched into the sky and occasionally waving as they cast some spell or other.  There were just two of them, as usual – they always spawned in a pair here.  I inched closer until they were in range, with Goobr cackling softly behind me.  “Shhh…” I whispered, and he toned it down a bit.  Sneaky, we are not.<br>
  <br>
I threw a spell on one, and it made a funny squeaking creaky noise, of terror I suppose, and started shuffling away as fast as its roots could take it.  The other turned to us and began casting, and I sic’ed Goobr on it.  With a loud cackle he ran after it and began gleefully chopping at its trunk.  Before he could get to it, though, it had tossed a couple spells on me.  Roots shot up out of the ground and began to bite into my legs, and a cloud of viciously biting bugs swarmed me.  Friggin' trees.  I waved my hand uselessly at the bugs and, stuck in place because of the roots, cast a couple more spells on the treant.  A cloud of darkness fell on the tree, darkness so complete that it sucked the life from it.   With the next spell, I started to drain life from the tree and used it to heal my wounds.  With its life force came a peculiar taste of wood, which wasn't nearly as bad as, say, the slimy, rancid taste a zelniak left behind.  I topped it all off with a spell that boiled the sap inside the woody bastard, and then sat to watch and rest, trying to ignore the roots that still tried to crawl under my skin.  I glanced to the south to check on the other treant, and it was nearly out of sight.  As I looked back to the battle the roots fell away and the bugs disappeared.<br>
  <br>
Goobr was still chopping away, but the treant had smacked him hard a couple times.  As I watched, the treant raised a branch and then nearly pounded Goobr into the ground like a stake.  He cursed, and then yelled, &quot;A little help, here!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Sissy!&quot; I yelled at him, and then stood and cast a spell that ripped the rest of the treant's life away and gave it to me.  My wounds healed, and the pain left so suddenly I almost felt dizzy.<br>
 <br>
Goobr shouted, &quot;Timberrrrrr!&quot; and danced out of the way as the treant thudded to the earth.  He giggled uncontrollably for a minute as I walked over and checked the carcass.  A few gold coins, and some wood chips scattered on the ground, nothing special.  Goobr proudly pointed me around the treant's side, where he had carved a deep divot in it, clean through the bark to the core.  I reached in and pulled out a wooden blob that looked like a heart, strangely pliant and dripping with sap.  &quot;Is this good for anything?&quot; I asked.<br>
<br>
Goobr shrugged.  I wiped it off and stuck it in my pack; I could always throw it away later if it was worthless.  &quot;Where'd that other one go?&quot; Goobr asked.<br>
  <br>
I shaded my eyes and looked south.  I couldn't see it, and shook my head.  <br>
<br>
&quot;You sure put the fear into that one.  He won't stop 'til he hits Lake Rathe.&quot;  Goobr giggled.<br>
<br>
&quot;Stop giggling,&quot; I muttered, as I watched the south.  &quot;Skeletons aren't supposed to giggle.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Bite me, blueberry boy.&quot;  He flipped me off and sat down.  &quot;And giggle-frickin'-giggle.  Sit down, it'll be back.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah.&quot;  I needed more mana, just in case the second one gave us any trouble, and cast the spell that slowly turned my own life force into the mana I needed to cast spells.  I sat back down, feeling nauseous.<br>
  <br>
&quot;You <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>could</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> heal me, you know,&quot; said Goobr, so I stood again and cast a couple heal spells on him.  Bones that were cracked or missing repaired and reappeared.<br>
  <br>
Finally, when the mana spell was just starting to eat into my bones with a deep, familair ache, the treant appeared on the horizon, shuffling back towards us, waving its branches with a spell.  It was still pretty far away though, and whatever it was trying to do didn't reach us.   “C’mon, let’s go,” I said, and Goobr and I ran up into range.  As Goobr ran to it I cast the same spells that I had used on the first one, and in a short time it too fell with a “Timberrrrrrrr!” and a cackle from Goobr.  We made our way back to the north, and saw the other treant had already respawned.<br>
  <br>
“Let’s get it,” said Goobr.<br>
<br>
“Naw, let’s go fi…. aaaw, crap.”  I had been about to say, let’s go fish a bit until my mana returned.  No fishing pole, though.  Goobr haw-hawed at me as I scowled at him.  “Dammit. You little…. All right.  Whatever.”<br>
<br>
We got in close enough again to the stupidly unsuspecting treant, and I cast the darkness spell and sic’d Goobr.  Roots grabbed me again, then the swarm of bugs, as I stacked on the hurty spells.  Goobr was still a little beat up from the last fight, so I cast the terror spell on the treant too, so it would try to run rather than stand there and pound on him.<br>
  <br>
Whoops.  The treant didn’t seem the least bit phased by my spell.  In fact… it seemed a bit angry – like, maybe – really angry.  The roots held my legs as it strode over and thwacked me hard with one of its branches – I would’ve been thrown about 20 feet back if the roots hadn’t held me tight.  Yeah – that'll leave a mark.  Goobr cursed like a sailor as he chopped away at its back, and I hurriedly tried to recast the fear spell.  Apparently, however, it was not my day, as the spell fizzled off into a weak little spark.  “Dammit, Nkai, DO something!” shouted Goobr.<br>
<br>
“I’m trying!”  The treant clocked me again, though, midway through another casting, and my spell shot off into the sky, scaring the hell out of an innocent passing bird.  I was getting dangerously low on mana, and might not be able to do a damned thing if this kept up.  The treant smacked me once more, just as the roots fell away, and I sailed through the air and landed hard on the ground.  Goobr managed to gain its attention again, and I tried to tap the treant’s life force to heal myself – I was pretty badly hurt.  Nothing.  My mana was too low.<br>
<br>
“Nkai!! A little help, here!” cried out Goobr.  The treant was owning him.<br>
  <br>
“Dammit…”  I hesitated, and then cast about the only spell I could at that point.  The spell threw me to the ground, by all appearances dead as a doornail, and then through the grass I watched Goobr get beaten to a pulp.<br>
  <br>
Goobr glanced around and saw I was down and faking death.  “What?!  Why you…!  Dammit, Nkai!!”  He cursed me right up until the treant lifted one huge root and squashed him into the dirt.<br>
  <br>
The treant shuffled back to where it had been.  It started to cast one spell, and then shuddered and crashed to the ground, eaten from within by the spells I had led off with.  Nothing else but silence – no Goobr to shout out timber and cackle like a fool afterwards.  Well, that was craptastical.  As a final insult from Karana, thunder cracked and it started to rain.<br>
  <br>
The rain really started to pour down, so I stood back up and tried to brush myself off.  I was in awful shape – raked by the treant’s branches, and thoroughly bruised and battered.  I uselessly looked around for something to steal life from, even though my mana was still too low to do squat.  I limped over to the carcass and took what I could – again just a few coins.  What was left of Goobr was crushed beneath it.  I made my way back over to the river, sat on the bank, and wished I had a fishing pole.<br>
  <br>
With the usual bit of difficulty I cleared my mind of fishing and meditated until I had regained some magic.  As I meditated, though, a small idea crawled into my mind, and by the time I was ready to go, I knew what I wanted to do next.  I considered my finances, and then made up my mind.<br>
  <br>
An aviak wandered by, intent on whatever little bird-man errand took it across the plains.  I was still pretty sore, soaked, and thoroughly grumpy, so I cast a spell and tore its life away, healing my wounds.  It gave out a little surprised squawk and fell over.  Once that was taken care of, I opened the gate back home, and stepped out onto the Plane of Knowledge.  <br>
<br>
<br>
I made my way through the crowd around the door to the bank.  Somebody was casting free spells, but not the type that I could use.  It had attracted a heck of a crowd, though, and I had to elbow my way past ogres and step over gnomes, halflings, and a 'dead' Iksar monk to get to the door.  Once inside I checked how much money I had saved up, and figured it should be enough if I was lucky.  I fought my way back out through the crowd and made my way through the Nexus of Luclin to the Bazaar.<br>
  <br>
Admittedly I had a lot less money than I had the week before.  I had been saving to buy a sword, of all things, and long before I thought I had enough, I happened across a merchant that was selling the very one I wanted for about a third of the normal price.  It was called The Putrid Fish, which sounds awful, but it is actually a nice little sword – very attractive, with a silvery, fish-like hilt and a curved, runed blade, and a nice little bit of magic attached to it.  I wasn’t all that good with it – let’s face it, if I’m the one fighting instead of Goobr something is terribly wrong.  But I liked it, I thought it looked great, and I believed it was money well-spent.  Regardless of the price, however, it had still done a number on my bank account, and I wasn’t sure I was going to be able to afford this next thing I wanted.<br>
  <br>
I checked around the merchants, and finally found what I wanted.  Well – kind of.  I needed the bones of some fish from the Planes of Nightmare and Valor, and although I certainly wasn’t headed to either plane anytime soon, other people had done some fishing there.  One merchant had the bones I needed, and another had fresh fish from Nightmare, all at a price I could barely afford.  I gated back to Knowledge and carefully deboned the Nightmare fish, and managed to not screw it up.  Then I talked to Ramos, one of my friends by the fish pond, and as he had promised, he gave me a magic tackle box for finding the weird fish for him.  I told him he should’ve gotten off his lazy butt and picked them up in the Bazaar himself.<br>
  <br>
I thoroughly tested my new possession right then and there, and woke up the next morning behind Darius’ stall with a hell of a hangover.  Good enough.<br>
<br>
I headed back to South Karana, and once I got back to the riverbank, I called up Goobr.  He was, as usual, anything but happy, and started in on me right away.<br>
  <br>
“You <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>jackass</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->!  You left me to die again!  You lazy, cowardly, …” and here he went off onto a long stream of curses, finally winding up by unkindly comparing my mother to somebody called ‘Smurfette’.<br>
  <br>
I waited him out and said, “It was you or me, and you know how that goes, Goobr.”<br>
<br>
He huffed and was silent.  Finally he muttered, “Bastard.”  He knew full well that if I died, he would be banished too.  After a moment he shrugged, and looked around.  “Still hunting here, though?” he asked.  I nodded.  He eyed my gear.  “I don’t see a fishing pole.  You haven’t gotten one yet?”  I shook my head.  He grinned.  “Great.  Let’s go kill stuff.”<br>
<br>
I shook my head again.  “Nope.  I have a hangover.  We’re going to stay right here.”<br>
<br>
“But…”<br>
<br>
I pulled out my new tackle box and triggered it, and a brand-spanking new fishing pole appeared.  Goobr’s jaw dropped open.  He was speechless for the first time in, well, a long time.<br>
  <br>
“Fishing poles,” he finally said, weakly.  “Endless fishing poles?”<br>
<br>
I nodded.  “But that’s not even the best part,” I said.<br>
<br>
“Oh?”<br>
<br>
“Well, you know the other reason I always give up and go back home to stock up on supplies?”<br>
<br>
“What, you run out of bait?”<br>
<br>
“No, no.  The other reason.”<br>
<br>
He shook his head.  <br>
<br>
I triggered the pole, and with a shimmer of magic, a mug of ale appeared.  Goobr just stared as I took a swig.  “No more beer runs, either,” I said. <br>
 <br>
Goobr shook his head and muttered under his breath.  <br>
<br>
I grinned evilly at him.  “Isn’t this great, Goobr?  No more worrying about broken poles.  No more hunting when I could be fishing.”   I pointed the end of the fishing pole at the hole in his skull where a nose would be.  “And no more trying to hunt when we should just cool it and fish and med.  Got it?” <br>
<br>
            He finally snapped his jaw back in place, muttered, and grumpily said, “Got it.&quot; He was silent for a while as I laughed at him and got out my tackle box and bait, and started to bait my line.  Finally he perked up.  “You'll still have to go get bait.”<br>
<br>
            “Yeah, yeah.  Thanks for reminding me. Life isn’t perfect.”<br>
<br>
            “And you said you have a hangover?”<br>
<br>
            “No.”<br>
<br>
            “Liar!”  He pretended to take a deep breath.<br>
<br>
            After six piercingly loud verses of “The Dwarves Came Down From the Mountain”, I sent him over to kill the treants while I continued to fish.  <br>
<br>
            It was lovely quiet the rest of the day.  <br>
<br>
