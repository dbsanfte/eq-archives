Chapter 3<br>
<br>
<br>
Blood crept out from the wound, barely noticed.  Cursèd gnolls can still get lucky from time to time, it seems.  The wound wasn’t deep but long enough that it was reluctant to close, compounded by being in the middle of her back.  She’d need a hand to get this one closed.<br>
<br>
She hadn’t been back to the Northlands for some time.  She’d done her homework this time, picking up some of their language from a human messenger under treaty with Freeport.  She entered the town, passing herself off as a disrespected half-elf.  She sought lodging and, swallowing her pride, paid through the nose for a little medical attention.  The barber warned her that there seemed to be some infection, as though the burning sensation and headache weren’t proof enough.  Returning to her room, she took a hot bath laced with medicinal herbs, and tipped the chambermaid to apply a poultice to her back.  She awoke that evening, famished.<br>
She went downstairs to the tavern, busy enough to provide a small sense of anonymity.  Pleased with her choice, finding that the menu seemed to move fast enough that she wouldn’t be placing her health in further risk. <br>
 <br>
The entrance of a dozen or so Northmen, heavy boots shaking the floor of the whole building, interrupted her meal.  They settled into the next room, belting out their orders for ales and foods.  Pounding of mugs on tables; congratulating themselves and each other on their deeds; drinking songs and revelry; the pounding in her head mounted to an extreme tribal beat.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> “Would you chest-beating, mouth-breathers shut up?”</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  She got silence all right, more than she had bargained for.  Damn.  This headache made her forget her surroundings just long enough to open her mouth too wide.  Her eyes rolled in spite of herself.  That was, most definitely, not a good thing to have done.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> “Well, well.  What makes you think I’m going to stand for any lip from a little waif like you?”  </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
He was fresh from battle, a steel breastplate bolstering his valour and his words.  A blood groove ran down his sword but he was a professional of sorts and, if the glint off the pommel was any indication, had already cleaned the blade.  His blade was unsheathed and in the air in a flash.  It was probably just a warning, a show of bravado but she couldn’t risk it.  She didn’t know their customs and their ways, whether she could attempt to backpedal diplomatically or if she’d be able to bluff with big talk, or pay for her words.  A judgement call – she thought she might be needing a window escape soon.<br>
<br>
He got lucky; and the throwing knife only struck him between the toes, pinning him, and distracting him mightily.  She sidestepped his swing, drawing herself close to his chest and had the blade in her right hand by his kidney the next moment.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> “I’d be dancing on your grave before you got a second swing of that sword of yours.”<br>
<br>
“Why shouldn’t I just order my men to cut you down where you stand?”<br>
<br>
“Two things; and they’re on either side of my other blade.”</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  She smiled, aware that her adrenalin had caught up with her actions, pushing the headache aside.<br>
Eyes locked for a long moment.  Then the Northman broke into steady laughter.  Smoothly, but deliberately, he sheathed his blade.  He leaned in just a little and said under his breath, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> “Make no mistake.  This could be finished now if I wished it.”</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  He leaned back still smiling.  She believed him.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> “Men, we have a guest.  Make room at the table.  Shove aside, McLynch.”</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  With hesitation, she sat at their table and accepted an ale.  The waitress brought her meal to the table and whispered with a smile, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> “You’re in with them.”</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  McLynch was duly impressed at the display and told her more than once during the course of the evening.<br>
<br>
It was odd, sitting with twenty-odd men, none of whom seemed to be trying to seduce her or kill her.  It was a nice change.<br>
<br>
Two days from then they were to have a charge on the walled fortress of Col’Enoch.  Rettus, their commander, spoke across the table to her while rubbing his sore toes.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> “We will ride at dusk and arrive before dawn.  My men are more than able for the task.  We have the brute force we need.  However, I suspect that we could cut down the time with a little subterfuge.  If you are as capable as I hope, their commander will be less able to rally his forces.  Without him, his men will be disorganized and flounder.  Pull this off, and I’ll see to it that you get a reasonable choosing from the commander’s own plunder.<br>
<br>
“But first, a little test to be sure.  Our local reeve is said to be overtaxing our families and kinsmen.  Bring back a ‘donation’ from him and we will consider that proof of your abilities.”<br>
<br>
“Is he the chubby fellow with the two-story place on the north edge of town?  3 dogs, 6 guards, and spiked fence?”</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Rettus paused.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> “Yes.”<br>
<br>
“I’ll think about it.”</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  She pushed herself away from the table, “I need to freshen up a bit.”  With that, she went upstairs.<br>
<br>
Returning a few minutes later, she descended the stairs and threw something into the air.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> “Rettus,”</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> he turned and caught it.  The pouch was heavy in his hand.  He looked at her and waited for her to answer.<br>
<br>
She shrugged.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> “I’ve been in town a full day.  A girl’s got to keep busy.”<br>
<br>
“This seems a bit light.”<br>
<br>
“I should hope so.  When I went in there this morning, I wasn’t going for you.  The rest is mine.”</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
That gave her just under 24 hours to prepare.  Starting with a good night’s sleep and a full breakfast.  Against her preferences, she accepted an offer from some of the soldiers’ wives for a steam bath.  The heat, the steam, and a fresh poultice seemed just what the barber ordered to beat down the infection.  Her body thanked her for it.<br>
<br>
Later, Rettus wanted to have everybody together to discuss tactics.  He protested when she got up to leave.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> “You may be able to clunk your way in there on a little sleep.  I need to pass through locked doors and behind guards’ backs.  I need my rest.  You can catch me up during the ride out tonight.”  </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
She did a little shopping in preparation for this trip.  A stop at the alchemists proved quite fruitful.  He had ‘firerock’, a chemical that would burn when exposed to air and had to be stored in liquid.  Using a few exchanges and different containers, she had him transfer a small quantity into a flask of refined oil.  A metal container, some straw for padding, and she was ready.  Both the seamstress and the weaponsmith accepted her rush orders and agreed to deliver the goods to the inn later.  Returning to the inn, she secured her pack, paid her bills, and arranged for a wake-up and a packed meal.  She hated working on an empty stomach.<br>
<br>
And so Rettus did catch her up on the trip.  The weather was already turning and the wind bit where it could find its way through.  She was to have a one-hour headstart.  Upon completion of her ‘assignment’, she was then to produce some form of distraction within the keep and that would be their signal to attack.  Should she fail, she was to give every impression that she was alone and acting on a contractual basis.<br>
<br>
They drew near the keep, high on a hill with rocky slopes.  She pulled her new white cloak around her and moved forward.  One man was instructed to keep an eye on her with his telescope until she got to the wall.  From that point, according to the outlines of the keep provided, she should need about 20 minutes to complete her task.<br>
<br>
They’d chosen the night well.  The moon was waning and only a small crescent.  She made it to the keep wall in near total darkness.  A braided hook thrown up, making no more than a small thump, gave her easy access over the lowest portion of wall.  One guard near, would have made easy prey but not worth the risk of it being discovered before she was done.  She allowed herself a single minute to scan the inner yard for later and then moved into the main building.<br>
<br>
Once inside, she reversed the cloak made for her, showing a plain grey fabric.  She’d had to mottle the fabric with charcoal for shadowwork but the effect was satisfying.  She found where the room where Enoch should be.  The door was locked but not for long.  She doused the nearest lantern so that no light would enter with her.  It swung in so she had to let it open an inch before she could dip a rag into her vial of oil to apply to the hinges.<br>
<br>
About 15 minutes by her best guess.<br>
<br>
She heard breathing from the other side of the room, deep and snoring enough to be a man’s.  Footsteps outside indicated a patrol in the hall.  Lantern flickers from under the door showed the man relighting the wick of the hall light.  All well and good.  She now had just a little bit more light to be just that much more accurate and, more importantly, to make sure that this man fit the description.<br>
<br>
She moved next to Enoch’s bed, removing her new weapon from her waist.  It was less a dagger, and more a razor-sharp “W” than anything else.  The outside blades would slice through the jugulars at the same time that the inner ones punctured the windpipe.  She needed this to be quick.  It was a weapon of assassination and would be useless in any other setting.  Standing almost over him for leverage, she balanced her weight.  In one move, she clamped one hand over his mouth and nose and, with her stronger arm and her full weight, plunged the weapon down into his neck.  There would be no air for screams and not much time for rescue if there were.  He thrashed for only a few seconds with blood letting quickly into the lungs, drowning him at the same time.  In fact, she almost made more noise forcing the weapon into him than he did in dying.<br>
<br>
A moment to pause.  She pulled the weapon free and wiped it briefly on the sheets.  She moved quickly about the room, gathering a few items of value and rolling them into a long cloth.  In case the raid itself failed and she didn’t get back in here, she would ensure at least a minimum payment.  She unlatched the shutter and opened it a crack.  She pulled herself up the window ledge and attached the braided hook to the sill.  She hit the ground a moment later and stepped into the shadows of a small balcony.  Around the corner was the chatter of a few guards around a small fire.  Just beyond them, the stables and a supply of hay.  Grey cloak tight around her, she moved a few feet to the side of the building – in plain sight but protected by night and colour.  She’d wanted to use a sling but knew now that it would be too loud and draw attention.  Instead, she opted to throw it in a high arc and watch it from where she was.<br>
<br>
She watched as it struck the semi-frozen ground, shattering the fragile glass.  The guards turned at the sound and saw nothing, probably mistaking it for an animal in the stables.  It took a moment for the firerock to dry sufficiently, but it soon ignited both the oils and the hay.  Within seconds, it was blazing and the stables were catching with it.  “That alchemist is getting a tip when I get back,” she thought to herself.<br>
<br>
Shouts started to break out and she beat a hasty retreat.  As she crested the low wall, she could her Rettus’ men charging.<br>
<br>
She stayed on the wall to watch.  Rettus was very competent, to say the least.  He and his squad were good.  Damn good.  At one point, she had to leave her roost to pull an extra guard off McLynch.  He didn’t seem to need much help, but it couldn’t hurt.  If she ensured their success, she’d ensure a better payment.<br>
<br>
This was far from her style of fight, and farther from what she was accustomed.  A little one on one, she’d done plenty.  One on two, rarely, but something like 60 on 40 – never.  Swords, pikes, knives flying every which way.  She had made one right choice in her life – she could never have been a warrior like this.  Rettus’ men were good enough that even outnumbered they would win this.  They were prepared to have fought against Enoch’s leadership.  She consoled herself that she helped minimize the losses somewhat.<br>
<br>
When it was finished, the prisoners were taken and marched out.  Dozens of bodies littered the courtyard.  She steeled herself to such carnage, regretting for the first time a health breakfast.  McLynch was the first above to be sure all was clear.  She was below when McLynch threw open the shutters.  His face was pale and their eyes met.  She was the same shade of pale.  Neither would ever do the other’s work.<br>
<br>

<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>Epilogue:</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
She took about 6 months worth of 'contracts' with Rettus' band.  Not every one of their raids would need her talents but she came on some just to observe.  She spent much time with the White Rose clan, refining her knowledge of the language, the local poisons and flora, and the shadowed arts.  It was here that she first heard of a magician named Miragul and his skills in teleportation.  It intrigued her, but there was little to research there.<br>
<br>
In time, she took her leave.<br>
