<br>
Today, I had a vision.  I realized that although I have been traversing the countryside, been to the dark moon of Luclin, visited many of the outer planes of existence and even fought alongside my friends in the plane of my god, Innoruuk, I have not seen anything ‘special’.  Every place I have been, every tower I have explored, every hall I have walked, has already been traveled by a large percentage of the teeming masses.  Of late, I have grown tired of seeing the same people in the same places, trying to sell me the same dream.<br>
<br>
So I am going to do something about it.  Possibly something… foolish.<br>
<br>
My research has uncovered another plane, one rarely visited.  It is called the plane of mischief and it is home to the foolish Bristlebane.  My research has also told me there is good reason no one dares travel there.  Its only entrance lies deep in the northern area of the Temple of Veeshan.  For the uneducated, the Temple is home to some of Norrath’s deadliest entities, the dragons.  While I am considered a friend to many of the dragons for my past battles against the wicked Kromrif clan of giants, the dragonkin in the northern section of the Temple care very little of the outside world.  Therein lies the difficulty of getting to the promised land.  But my mind was made up.<br>
<br>
I started gathering the items I would need for an extended holiday away from the familiar faces.  Two stacks of peridots would keep me safe and allow me to call upon my pet when the need would arise, as well as two stacks of bone chips.  I have not heard of vendors being found there, so two stacks each of food and drink should also last quite a while.  Plenty of fishing bait if I desire a little down time and of course my fisherman’s companion.  Once there, I would bind my soul to a safe location, so I will need a way to return if my guild needs me.  How would I do this?<br>
<br>
I recall a young rogue friend of mine, Naoki, once showed me a magical hammer that would transport its wielder to the outpost in The Overthere when it hit upon an enemy just right.  After asking around about this item, it seems rather easy to acquire.  I made my way to the outpost and found the undead foreman, holder of the hammer.  It turns out he is looking for workers to help him and his crew finish the boat construction, and the hammer would be given to the person who helped.  Unfortunately, he also decided he didn’t like me enough to allow me to offer my assistance.  The fool.  I took a step back into a small corner, one where I would not be spotted working my magic, and placed a charm on the foreman.  He came running to me as a puppy would to its master and practically begged me to allow him to work for me.  I told him I would assist him in the construction and gave him a small token of my appreciation, a piece of jade I had found, and he offered me the hammer I needed.  I then feigned death and allowed the foreman to resume his normal activities.  Upon sitting up, I checked the foreman to make sure he didn’t remember my transgression upon him and all was well.  I sat down upon the grass to closer examine my treasure.  From out of no where, the squadron of Dragoons that patrols the outpost set upon me.  Apparently, I was not as far from peering eyes as I had thought, and someone went for help.  In just a few short seconds, I was sitting in the Plane of Knowledge, where I had last bound my soul.  Naked and weak.  The bastards had killed me and forced me to re-gather my energies elsewhere.  With a sigh of resignation, I sat down and began memorizing my traveling spells and headed back to the outpost to gather my belongings.<br>
<br>
Back in the Plane of Knowledge, I decided to test out this hammer to see how it worked.  I used the transport and quickly arrived outside Felwithe, home of the weak high elves.  I spotted a young fairy maiden and proceeded to bash her with my hammer.  What a rush!  I have not been in melee combat for ages, but it did not take my arms long to reacquaint themselves with the familiar timing of the swing.  However, due to the size of the hammer, it was taking way too long for my swings to find purchase, much too long to try to hit my opponent ‘in just the right place’.  12 swings later, I was a little disoriented to find myself inside a boat, presumably a boat in the outpost.  Sure enough, my new toy had worked and placed me in my new job as a construction worker.  Bah.<br>
<br>
That idea was not going to get me out of the plane of mischief in an emergency.  I remember while I was working with the Coldain dwarves of Thurgadin, they taught me to fashion a potion.  This potion was to be delivered to their spy outside of Kael and would transport him back home for debriefing as well as medical attention.  Why could I not use this potion myself?  I headed to my second home of Thurgadin and made myself the potion.  I now had everything I needed to get back home whenever I wanted.<br>
<br>
I headed back to the Plane of Knowledge to find some friends of mine, and ask for magical enhancements that would make my travels a little safer.  Minnieso, a shaman of some regard, provided me with an enhancement that would allow me to travel faster than normal, and I lucked into a few high level casters of various schools of magic that were providing the area with enhancements.  Hand of Virtue, Talisman of the Boar, Koadic’s Endless Intellect.  Suddenly, I was prepared for a raid upon a god, rather than a simple journey.<br>
<br>
The speed enhancement cast on me by Minnieso should last quite a while, and my research told me I needed to head to the Skyfire Mountains in order to access the Temple of Veeshan.  Once I got to the Temple entrance, I found it was locked and I was not holding a key.  In utter disgust, I sat upon the ground to contemplate my next move.  I went over my notes on this place, and found that I had been mislead!  This was the entrance to Veeshan’s Peak, not the Temple of Veeshan!  I quickly gated back to the Plane of Knowledge and asked around for a teleport to Cobalt Scar.  As it turns out, the entrance to the Temple is located in the badlands of the Western Wastes.  Good, this would also allow me to test my alliance with the dragonkin.  Upon setting foot on the cold land, I located a small wyvern and checked her reaction to my presence.  She seemed to regard me amiably, so my last visit to Kael was not in vain.  I loaded up my traveling spells once again, Dead Man Floating, Shield of the Magi and Skin of Shadow.  Now I could easily travel to the Temple unmolested.<br>
<br>
I reached the entrance to the Western Wastes and decided to bind my soul there, should anything bad happen.  From there I set off to find the Temple and passed many of my new ‘friends’, the dragons.  Without incident, I found the Temple and entered.  While I thought I would be the only person visiting this accursed area, I was wrong.  There in front of me were six members of the Kindred Spirit Guardians.  I hailed them, and asked if they were planning a small raid.  They responded that they were, but were waiting on a few stragglers.  I told them my plans to run to the entrance of the plane of mischief, and asked if I had time to do so before they began.  I did not want to upset their plans and cause a train of dragons and dragonkin, the likes of which would certainly be epic.  One of their numbers wished me luck and asked that I let him know if I make it, or if I…. don’t.<br>
<br>
Cautiously, I pulled out my scribbled map of the temple and set off through the halls.  Surrounded by drakes, wyverns and chromodracs, my pulse was racing.  I located the spot where the northern section begins, said a quick prayer, cast my first harmshield and took off.  This shield would keep me safe from all harm for 18 seconds, and could not be cast again for 30 minutes.  I noticed that I suddenly had attracted the interest of many, many, MANY Temple residents, and they were none too happy to see me.<br>
<br>
Three seconds into my harmshield and so far so good.  It was then that my speed enhancement wore off.  It was too late to turn back, so I pressed on, following my map as best as I could while running (albeit slower than anticipated) and being attacked by hordes of dragonkin.  15 seconds later, my first harmshield failed and I stopped to cast my second (and last) harmshield.  I managed to get the spell off in spite of being hit many times, and off I took again.  I made it about 5 feet to the plane entrance when my second harmshield failed, and that is where I died.<br>
<br>
Arriving at my bind point, I called in a favor owed to me by a friendly druid.  Arryn quickly responded and brought to me a shaman made potion that would allow me to speed myself up and one coffin, as I needed to summon my body out from under the toes of a rather large dragon, who’s name I seemed to have missed while being eaten.  I told the Kindred Spirit Guardians that it was safe for them to proceed, and that I had not made it to my goal.  I headed back to the Temple entrance, summoned my body, and resurrected myself.  It had been a long night, and I was very tired.  I decided to set up camp here at the Temple entrance, and try again in the morning.<br>

*Stretch*<br>
<br>
*Yawn*<br>
<br>
I must admit, the temperature in this area is very conducive to a good night’s sleep.  Aside from the dragon roar at about midnight, I slept like the dead.  As a matter of fact, I am so rested and relaxed, now would be the perfect time to make another attempt to enter the plane of mischief.<br>
<br>
I take a step outside and use my shaman speed potion, as well as casting all my defensive and traveling spells.  Once back in this godforsaken Temple, I take out my map to examine my path for the last time.  Committed to memory, I take off through the halls.  There seems to be more residents around that during my last terrifying run, although none of them look unique.  Mostly drakes and wyverns.  Once I hit the area in the northern section where my invisibility spell no longer cloaks me from my enemy’s vision, I cast my first harmshield, say a quick prayer to Innoruuk and take off across the cliff as fast as I can.  Soon, I am once again surrounded by the flapping of wings and various curses, while claws and magic attempt to rend my body to pieces.  I make it about half way to the entrance, and pause for a moment to cast my second harmshield.  If this shield will hold out long enough, and if I am able to find the entrance, I should be fine.  Mid-cast, however, I notice a wisp of smoke coming from my arm.  Then the pain starts, and I am barely able to continue my casting.  I summon all my strength to fight the pain and manage to get my shield spell off.  No time to think, I must continue running.  Up the cliff, across its apex and down a small hill, I look ahead to see a hall way leading to the right.  Standing in the entrance of this hall is a rather large wurm.  If memory serves me correctly, this is the wurm which killed me yesterday, so that means I am close.  I begin to feel the shield keeping me alive start to wane, so I make haste past the wurm and down the hall.  My informants tell me, just down the hall here is a small tile on the floor, in the shape of a castle.  One touch to this tile is all I need to teleport me to the plane of mischief.  I frantically search the ground for this tile, but am unable to see it.  I pause for a moment to look around, and the area is suddenly filled with multi-colored claws scraping against the floor.  I feel a singe of fire against my skin and realize my shielding is gone… and that is when I see the tile I am looking for.  Five feet away, I make a desperate lunge for the ground.  Just as my fingers touch the smooth surface, I feel the sting of a claw pierce my leg, and I am plunged into darkness.<br>
<br>
I materialize upon a blue platform in the middle of a forest.  This, however, is unlike any forest I have ever been in.  The trees are topped with pink and golden leaves, the air is heavy and there is an odd smell that I cannot name.  In the distance, I spot what looks like a denizen of this area.  Vaguely, it reminds me of the Moldmaster found in the deep mines of Runnyeye, but a darker green.  A large bixie flies towards me, glances in my direction and keeps on its course.  Good, it would appear that nothing in the immediate area seems to care about my presence.  Quite a nice change.  And that smell again… familiar and yet unrecognizable.<br>
<br>
So enraptured by my new surroundings, I fail to realize that I am wounded.  Suddenly, I put a name to the smell, rotting flesh.  I look down at my arm and notice there is an infection that is eating away at my skin, rapidly.  Thinking back to the recent past, I recall my arm being hit with a fluid while casting my second shield in the Temple.  While I watch, the infection spreads down my arm and onto my hand.  My strength is beginning to fail, and I am slipping into unconsciousness.  Faster than I have ever moved before, I rip my spell book from my robes and quickly look up my soul binding spell.  I memorize that spell, and while I gather my energies to cast it, begin to memorize my strongest lifetap.  I stand to bind my soul, my legs buckle and I stutter a word.  The seriousness of this situation begins to gnaw at my soul.  I will die very soon, if I cannot cast this spell, I will re-gather my energies at the entrance to the Temple of Veeshan.  And all of my equipment will be here, in the plane of mischief.  I calm my mind and begin casting again.  A wave of relief washes over me as I can feel my essence attune to my surroundings.  Moments left before I fade into darkness, I quickly rummage through my pouches in search of my salvation.  My fingers close upon a stalking probe, made for me by my good gnomish friend, Vegann.  Fumbling with the object, I find its activation button and watch as it unfolds into an eye.  I cast my lifetap on the eye and sit down to let the healing begin.  As I suspected, dragons have very strong magic, and even stronger spit!  All told, it took five lifetaps from my, now useless, stalking probe to fully combat the effects of the vile substance.<br>
<br>
With the desperation fading, I can now begin to make plans to explore this new area.  I summon forth my spectre companion and move hesitantly into the forest.  As I approach, nothing seems to be aware of my presence.  I keep moving along the edge of the plane, when I feel a light tap against my back and my minion is telling me it is attacking my aggressor.  Spinning around, I come face-to-face with… a grumpy tree?  How odd.  And this tree is throwing pansies at me!  And these pansies are fighting my pet (and winning).  I gather my energies and begin to heal my pet and cast my most aggressive damage over time spells on these flowers.  I root them to the ground and ask my pet to kindly back away from the pansies.  They remind me of the aggressive flowers in the Emerald Jungle, but much stronger.  After what seems like an eternity, I am victorious against the flora and stoop to examine my slain enemy.  Tangled in its roots is what appears to be a fishing grub.  But this grub is sweet smelling and a little larger than the ones found on the ground around Norrath.<br>
<br>
Pressing on through the forest, I come upon a moat surrounding a castle.  This must be the home of Bristlebane, god of mischief.  I follow the moat and find a bridge leading to a rampart, where a rather large hand is crawling across.  Following this large hand, is a smaller hand.  Listening to their conversation, it would seem the large hand is called ‘My Finger’ and the smaller, ‘Not Yours’.  Very curious, the residents of this plane.  I move to take a step onto the bridge and find myself plunged in the moat.  Bah! An illusion!  I drag myself out of the moat only to find a young female Halfling running by with a large bixie following closely behind.  The Halfling glances over her shoulder at the bixie and excitedly asks if they can play in the water of the moat.  The bixie does not seem very interested, and wanders off, soon followed by the Halfling.  I follow the moat to its end to a waterfall.  Across the moat on the rampart is another Halfling, male this time, fishing.  I cast Dead Man Floating upon myself and make my way towards the rampart wall.  My foot catches on something mid air and I realize there is an invisible bridge leading to the top.  I run up the bridge and cautiously approach the Halfling.  He resembles the sheriffs of Rivervale but does not seem to share their disdain of dark elves.  Although he does not attack me out-right, I recall hearing from a friend not to talk to the residents of this plane, until I know a little more about them.  Leaving the Halfling alone, I travel along the rampart to the false bridge, passing both hands as I go.  The moat continues along both sides of the wall, and across the moat is the castle.<br>
<br>
Before me is a bridge leading across the moat to the castle entrance, complete with 2 or 3 arches.  Hoping this is not another illusion, I start to cross the bridge.  I make it to the other side of the bridge when I hear a strange chanting coming from the arch!  I turn around to see what is happening and suddenly I am stripped of all my enchantments.  Cursing under my breath, I sit down to memorize my defense spells again.  I stand and begin casting my personal shield.  Poof, dispelled again.  I move into the castle courtyard and cast my shield again. It sticks!  I finish my defense routine and move further into the castle.  Guarding the door are two skunks.  Past the skunks is another door, which will not open.  It is not locked, it is not magically sealed… then I realize the door is a ruse.  I search the area for a secret entrance and come upon a hall, hidden by an illusion of a wall at its front.  I make my way down the hall and through several corridors when I finally come upon a room.  In the center of this room, on a small platform, is a large treasure chest.  There are three halls leading off this room one across from me, and one on my left and right.  The walls of are covered with paintings, but all the paintings are the same.  The face of Bristlebane himself.  I approach the chest to inspect it and realize it is a living being.  I step back, augment my pet, and send it in to attack.  It has been much too long since my last slaughter, and I am eager to see what the spoils of battle will be here.  Upon its first hit, my pet is set upon by no less than four guards, all of whom materialized from the corners of the room.  I know this is no battle I can win, so I feign death and let my pet get slaughtered.  When the dust of the quick battle settles, I stand and ponder this new development.  Now I know, while a room may look safe at first glance,  don’t expect it to remain so during a fight.<br>
<br>
Tired from processing all of this new information, I decide to bind my soul here at this location, and set up camp for the evening. In the Plane of Mischief. Alone and far away from my friends...<br>

Alas, if only you'd have taken me along, I could have spun tales of your inherent evilness and the foul desires that drove you to this strange and confusing place.<br>
<br>
I would educate the willing audience in the Plane of Knowledge in song and verse!<br>
<br>
From your second-hand information, let me attempt to spin you a song...<br>
<br>
Of Whisperr, Mischief and Lifetapped Eyes.<br>
<br>
Upon her way she went, vigorously,<br>
to a plane where Bristlebane, misschievously,<br>
rules with red-black checkered fist, disorderly.<br>
<br>
She gained her entrance, surreptitiously,<br>
invisibly she explored, most rigously,<br>
she drew her conclusions, most brilliantly,<br>
and conveyed them to me, most coherently,<br>
however I must add, apparently, <br>
to those that listened advertently,<br>
that Whisperr, named quite apptly,<br>
wanted little fame, apparently.<br>
<br>
She left to me, accordantly,<br>
a burden shouldered most obligingly,<br>
to take &quot;care&quot; of fans, most fantatically.<br>
<br>
So ends the tale, conveniently.<br>
<br>
Yours truly.<br>
<br>

You're my new lyricist!<br>
<br>
As sort of a final &quot;Day Three&quot; thing... there isn't one. I figured out that it's too mana inefficient to solo there, at least at my current level.  Every mob I fought summoned, so I could not root-rot. All mobs are pretty tightly packed, so no fear kiting. They hit like a freight train, so pet tanking was out.<br>
<br>
All said and done, I think I killed about 10 things in 3 days, and each kill took a full mana bar to do.  Just not worth it.<br>
<br>
If, some time in the future, a slower or healer would want to chance the trip, I'd love to go again. Until that time, mischief is no place for me!<br>
<br>
Glad everyone enjoyed the stories though!<br>
