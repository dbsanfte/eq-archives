Classes combined...</span><hr size=1> It’s been more than a month now since I last teamed in a “normal” team. You know, the “1 cleric, 1 chanter, 3 tanks and a caster” kind of team. I found out that, when soloing, the chances of getting killed were much smaller, no one was trying to tell me how to play my class, and overall exp was considerably better because I could just log on and start nuking instead of wasting time with shouting the “wizzy level x looking for group” thing. On top of it all, the fights last less than a minute so after that I can take a 10-15 minute break to chat, read the /guild and /ooc talks, see how my old friends are doing, and so on. I kinda like it, and really recommend it to all solo-able classes.<br>
From time to time thou, someone walks by my camp spot and, while I’m Invis medding up, might get the idea that the camp is “free” and attack my prey. In those cases we usually end up partnering. Kinda the mellow version of soloing: Exp is a little less, but the chance that you have to gate out is much smaller, and the chance to get to know someone new is always welcome of course.<br>
Funny thing is the difference between different classes. Some class-combinations are divine, much better than I ever expected, others are a complete nightmare. <br>
Now, what I was curious about: do any of you guys have similar partnering experiences? How much do you guys solo/partner, and how much do you go for the “Classical” group thingie? I’m still pretty new at it, and am sure that I encountered some strange exceptions, that I now take as an example for the whole class. Besides, my exp is limited to the Wizzy point of view, and even there pretty fragmented. Nevertheless, I’m posting my list here, more to be able to learn from your reactions, and update it accordingly, than as a “rule” thing. Maybe, with enough reactions, we could draw up a kind of matrix, with all possible class-combinations, that could really be used a s a reference.<br>
I work with 4 categories: Rocks, Nicey, Average and Bites. I usually try to avoid the Average and Bites categories but, as said before, still have my “learning moments” about particular combinations. My experience until now:<br>
Wizzy – Bard:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Nicey!<br>
Wizzy – Beastlord:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp              Dunno. Wanna try that! Please anyone! Get a beastlord to 35 ASAP!<br>
Wizzy – Cleric:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Dunno. Do Clerics solo/partner anyway? <br>
Wizzy – Druid:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rocks! (Wizzy pulls, druid snares, wizzy and druid nuke, druid heals damages wizzy. Besides, most druids I met were nice people)<br>
Wizzy – Enchanter:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Nicey! (Hey, of course I like chanters!)<br>
Wizzy – Mage:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Nicey<br>
Wizzy – Monk:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Average<br>
Wizzy – Necro:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Dunno. (How come I never encountered a soloing necro? They should rule at it!)<br>
Wizzy – Pally:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Nicey! (Actually the only melee class I am giving above Average)<br>
Wizzy – Ranger:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Average<br>
Wizzy – Rogue:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Bites (Please prove me that I’m wrong here!)<br>
Wizzy – Shadowknight:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Dunno. (Any 30-ish SK’s who want to partner with a wizzy?)<br>
Wizzy – Shaman&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Dunno. (Dunno about this combination. Have this itchy feeling this is one of those matches made in Hell, but would love to be proven wrong of course)<br>
Wizzy – Warrior:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Average (For a warrior, it must be a nightmare to partner with me)<br>
Wizzy – Wizzy:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rocks! (Before the mob gets angry, it’s dead)<br>

With filyne I've solo'ed mostly till 30,  a good part of it was grouping with Lumis.<br>
<br>
Just the other night I got on and grouped for the first time (in a full group) with Filyne, I was scared as heck. As I never really had the need to do much with mezzing. <br>
<br>
Though I found out that I can mezz alright and I can keep the buffs and clarity on the casters without them having to ask.  So that worked out.<br>

Oh ya also had to group with Ukei, but that was just a spy mission at the time.  :)<br>

Classes combined...</span><hr size=1> Reason you never find a necro is cause they are kings of solo and don't want to partner.<br>
I think bards are exceptional partners for several reasons<br>
Primarily they are so versatile,<br>
If you need a:<br>
Chanter (mez and charm, and mana battery)<br>
Druid (snare and dots, and mez)<br>
Meleer (haste and slash, and slows)<br>
<br>
And bards can do a great poor man's taunt with charm or mez<br>
<br>
I have partnered with many ppl and found that <br>
Druids, wizzy, clerics, shaman, and necros were the best partners.  But we also partner well with all melee types because of our haste and healsongs<br>
<br>
I think that if you are looking for a specific partner to handle specific mobs then bards are not your best option.  But if you are going it to a fight where variables can change, then bards are the wisest choice.  <br>
A very tired cliche but still very true &quot;Bards are jacks of ALL and master of NONE&quot;.<br>

Classes combined...</span><hr size=1> Sunday evening I tried for the first time to pair up my lvl 40 druid with Gyzmo the lvl 35 wizzy in Eastern Wastes and we had an amazing time with the Ulthorks.<br>
<br>
With only 161wis on the druid there is no way he could have quad kited those Ulthorks alone, but together with the wizzy there was never any doubt to the outcome when I pulled 4 ulthorks (and once because of a counting error on my part we were kiting 5 ulthorks <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ). <br>
<br>
I pull, snare, bunch them nicely up, AoE nuke a couple of times and then parade them around in front of the wizzy while he works wonders with that AoE nuke of his.<br>
<br>
The only problem we met was that we were killing them too fast to have a steady supply <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
This combo definitely is up there in the Rocks! ranking on the Etelka Scale <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
<br>
Druid/necro is another combo I have tried that also works very well. If the druid snares then all the necro has to worry about is keeping fear on the mob while his pet beats away. And with skelly form and druid chloro the necro will never lack mana.<br>
<br>
And I certainly shouldn't leave out Team Leezard, the unstoppable pair of Sartis the Warrior and Shykar the Shaman <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Finally, throw a bunch of mages together and your only worry will be how to pull fast enough to keep the pets happy. <p><img src="http://simplex.gsia.cmu.edu/~michael4/eq/sartis.jpg">

Classes combined...</span><hr size=1> To expand a little on the class combo thing...<br>
<br>
Bard: A smart bard is the best thing in the world to group with, unless you need some big time healing.  There is almost nothing a bard can't do if played right.<br>
<br>
Beastmaster: Pet weilding monks...  doesn't seem to bad, I'm going to give one a whirl.<br>
<br>
Cleric: If you even just bearly solo, with a cleric you can duo like magic.<br>
<br>
Druid: Read my last post<br>
<br>
Enchanter: Not really as useful in a duo, in a larger group they can make the differene between phat lewt and experience to spare and messy corpse recoveries.<br>
<br>
Magician: A wizard that's not afraid to taunt.<br>
<br>
Monk:  Good to group up with, although they really don't provide more than a warrior.<br>
<br>
Necromancer: Read my last post.  However, duoing with someone who can nuke on a tougher mob can be very rewarding.  But Necro/necro duos tend to overlap with DOTs, so they aren't very effective unless you plan ahead who will be casting what spells.<br>
<br>
Paladin: A mini-tank who can heal.  Great in a duo.<br>
<br>
Ranger: Like paladins, only not so tanky.<br>
<br>
Rogue:  Caster/rogue duos are awful, in order to get the most out of the partnership the caster need to retain enough hate to get a BS off, which is not so great.  In tank/rogue duos, they are great.  Just be sure to taunt it off the rogue.  In larger groups they are really great.<br>
<br>
Shadowknight: Very offensive paladins, but not just like Herbert's armpits.  With pets, swords, and spells, they make a great powerhouse in a group or duo.<br>
<br>
Shaman: Honestly, not the best one to duo with, escpially as a caster, but a fighter/shaman combo's good for the stat boosts and healing.  In groups they're great.<br>
<br>
Warrior: In duos or groups, they are the backbone of the group, and keep everyone else alive.<br>
<br>
Wizard: Great in duos and groups, as long as they're smart enough to keep the hate down.<br>

druid and ranger suck bite big time which is why amo lvled so slow since all her friends at the time were rangers and rogues <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Classes combined...</span><hr size=1> Heh, playing a warrior i can tell you we do NOT solo. I think the only class worse at soloing than a Warrior is a Rogue. Soloing is not for Warriors, Rogues, Clerics(unless its undead), and paladins(since their offense spells are..well..a joke <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )although paladins can do better than warriors and rogues. Having not played a bard i dunno but in my experience the best melee class soloer is a Shadow Knight(Beastlord might top it but have yet to see). All the caster classes can solo much more effectively than any melee. Although i think Warriors got screwed more than a little on their offensive capabilities.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub22.ezboard.com/uherbertdalovebug.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Herbert Dalovebug</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Secksie Troll Strippur</span><br>  Posts: 70<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(12/4/01 4:01:39 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.druzzil-ro.net/pic/bum.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Reactions please!

<br>
it IS possible. heh. <br>
<br>
though- i mean, when you have a couple hundred k worth of items, not much is impossible in EQ =\<br>

Damn you dave*, damn you.. ~LOL~ <br>

Classes combined...</span><hr size=1> About 90% of my EQ experience has been solo or in small groups of 2 or 3.  First of all, everything Sartis said is exactly right.  A druid/wizzy pair and a shaman/warrior pair are about as fun and effective as it gets.<br>
<br>
But to my point, Et ... you were wondering about a wizzy/shaman pair.  Well, I have never paired that way, but I play both a wizzy AND a shaman.  Based on a pretty good understanding of both classes, I am believe they would make a wonderful pair.  Basically, it would be a modified shaman solo routine.  The shaman pulls with slow then sicks the pet.  At that point, a solo shaman will DOT the mob then root it ... leaving the DOT and pet to finish the job.  With a wizzy, I think the shaman would skip the DOT, let the pet get the agro ... then have the wizzy nuke ... when the mob agroes on the wizzy ... root.<br>
<br>
Alternately, they could just kite the mob with the shammy DOT'ing, the wizzy nuking, and the pet bitin at his heals.  In this case the wizzy would pull.  Gotta love the fact that wizzys have a snare spell.<br>
<br>
Seems like a pretty good pair to me.<br>

Classes combined...</span><hr size=1> OK I gotta stick up for the necros here.<br>
True we solo alot and are good at it.  I am level 49 now and have never had a problem finding a place to solo efficently.  It is lonely and I do not solo much at all, i generally atleast partner up.  Necros have a bad rep in groups and dungeons and granted some of it is deserved.  The pet can cause havoc and without our pets our spells at times can be less effective than other classes,  However  a necro who knows how to partner/group is a great boon to any group. Here is why darkness line of spells if noone else can snare, root, resistance debuff, strong pet, Fear, crappy short term mez.<br>
I have teamed up with just about every class at one time or another and we are great to partner with.  (I expect Svien and Pied to stick up for me here)  The reason for this is we can control the movement of the mob to a degree.  Dark, fear, and a buffed pet hitting the mob in the back will stun it quite a bit.  At this point any class can jump in with melee, or dots, or DD.  Of course you must be selective of where you fight there are some places you just do not want to fear.<br>
Necros have a wide variety of spells and may not be the best at many kinds but they can fill in if it is needed.<br>
<br>
But if you get in a group with a necro that is not willing to change how they fight or does not know good group tactics.<br>
<br>
RUN<br>
very very fast because they will get you killed.<br>
