I apologize that the response has been negligible at best. Unfortunately we have recently undergone a massive restructuring, and not many members are visiting our boards at the moment. I will be sure to post a GMOTD to advise of the upcoming raid. Once we get reorganized I would love to have DC raid with Rutabaga Paradox. Alas for now that probably is not possible. In any event good luck on the upcoming raid. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=437447">Neofelis Nebulosa<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Gnome Wizard</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#660066><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub22.ezboard.com/brutabagaparadoxforum.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tygersai>Tygersai</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://liquid2k.com/nonameguy/EFlier.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Found The Salad Bar! </span><br>  Posts: 20<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(11/20/02 12:03 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub22.ezboard.com/frutabagaparadoxforumgeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=968.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://thirdwizard.homestead.com/files/pimpasterjimmy/magatsu.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Vox raid 12/8 message thread.</span><hr size=1> I just dinged 39 tonight..

[quoteLet me preface this by saying that I did 23 Vox raids before I finally got my white scale. Don't expect to win one time and come away happy. If you do, you are one of the lucky few. After all the fuss, I decided to buy my red scale in Bazaar...frankly because I was tired of dedinging. AA expereince came about and I was almost the only lvl 52 baron on the Solusek Ro server  Naggy is MUCH easier than Vox, but we always seemed to get Pally books and CoF instead of red scales. Of the 23 raids I attended, Vox fell 14 times. Here are some tips:<br>
<br>
-Never, under ANY circumstance do a cattle call pickup raid. If you are short on numbers, seek out classes you need. (This will most likely be chanters) Telling the auction channel or a zone that there will be a raid will bring the &quot;what's in it for me&quot; loot mongers. Send personal tells and arrange pickups. /who all works wonders. Can't stress this enough.<br>
<br>
Groups should be similar to the following:<br>
G1 4 tanks cleric bard (MT group)<br>
G2 3 tanks chanter cleric bard<br>
G3 left over tanks clerc/shammy/druid<br>
G4+ Caster group with a lesser healer<br>
<br>
-Fight your way to the lair. This seems redundant, but I have seen some spawns missed which ended up biting us in the butt. The best way to go is to pull all mobs sans Vox to the Kings room. This includes the lair spawns such as Priest of Nagafen and the Diplomat. Best bet is a monk puller but it isn't needed. My guild used a paladin who died every so often. Send someone with good HP's and knows the path to and from. Corpse recovery should be rather easy this way should the puller die. Have the bards each charm a mob and call which one will be released. (I.e. Ossian charms Diplomat, the target is Priest. When Priest dies, Ossian announces his pet is released.) Have the puller camp or /q when the last spawn has been pulled. Use Eye of Zomm to check the lair to make sure no one has Vox aggro and she is in th ecenter of the room. If she isn't have everyone in the puller's group camp and come back.<br>
<br>
-Buff in the hallway before the ramp. If you have unexperienced people, you will almost certainly get someone going up the wrong ramp to the lair entrance. This wastes time with a corpse team getting someone out of the pits. The correct ramp to go up is the second one on the left. The first has a pit trap and the ramp straight ahead has one as well. Lev will not help you avoid the traps. Don't camp out to maximize buffs because you will never have the same amount of people coming back. Similarily, make due with LD's. Wait a few minutes for them to show and improvise if too much time has passed. Watch the Ice Giant spawns and make sure that people notify the raid if a block of Permafrost drops for the warriors.<br>
<br>
-Buff misinformation is now very important. In the older days, Vox would dispell your first 4 buffs. Those days have passed. It is now a RANDOM debuff that is hard to plan for. Best advice is to randomly do your buffs. I always found that my first buff was always gone. The rest varied. Junk buff first buff and stack them in imporatnt buff, junk buff fashion. (I.E. see invis, Group resist magic, illusion, circle of seasons, etc.) Mix it up towards the bottom. I never found my 3rd buff debuffed, so I would suggest your main HP buff in this slot.<br>
<br>
-Fight Vox in the lair. There are methods to pull her to the hall, but it is too confusing for those who do not know the method. I am assuming that your guildies are not master Vox raiders, or else you wouldn't have asked for the advice. In the lair, there are trap spots that people will fall into that lead down to the pits. Best way to avoid this is to have Dead man floating cast on the raid. Make this one of your latter buffs. When you are feared, you can't steer clear of the traps. The more DPS you have, the better.<br>
<br>
-Set rules before you engage. If you are calling a scale, let the raid party know. The three raids I attended where a scale dropped, there were two scales on the corpse. Don't bank on it, but it seems to be a more common occurence. This is enticing for other bards to join up for a shot even when a scale is called. <br>
<br>
-Have a cleric that can cast Aegolism present. This is the difference between victory and defeat. They will not be able to participate, but they can greatly increase your chances of success. Most will tell you that bard songs are the key. Yes, they help out alot...but having that extra 1500 HP's will keep you alive.<br>
<br>
-The guide listed was made pre-Luclin and possibly pre-Velious. Fear will hit your group even with chants going. The BEST method I found was to play Amplification and Song of Warmth. Try to get under her neck to belly and you should be out of range for most ae ice comets. This also allows you to contribute to the DPS albeit bards don't have alot to offer in that department. But, you figure that you hit 40+ 20 times and that is 800 HP's or almost a 1/32 of her health. Contrary to opinion, tuck the drum away.<br>
<br>
-Vox will get off at least one Cheal. I have been on raids where we won and only one person died. She was mana sieved and interupted, but still got one off. Don't fret it. Mana sieve helps alot, but the key is to ALL be on the same side and push her. Don't circle around her and try to guide her to the center. If she is getting too close to the wall, switch sides. Call it in the raid channel and spam it. The last thing you want is for her to get &quot;free&quot; heals and summons. If you push her, you will have a greater success interupting her casting. Don't waste the time with bardic mana sieve. It isn't reliable enough to risk dropping your cold resists. Warriors should be using fearless discs to get the most DPS.<br>
<br>
-Tash Vox at 80%. Set the tasher before hand. No other caster should attempt a nuke until she first reaches 50% All casters must be in melee range to land a nuke. Clerics should focus on the melees for healing. There really isn't enough time to worry about your other party members. Sad, but it is true.<br>
<br>
-When Vox dies, have someone designated to lock the corpse. This may change with the new raid features being implemented allowing you to designate looters. There should be 4-6 items on the corpse. The only no drop item will be the white dragon hide pelt used in a cloak quest. (the one that used to use the white scale). Don't call or roll on loot until every corpse has been accounted for.<br>
<br>
-Rolling for loot sucks. Best method is to do it need before greed sans any previously called pieces. DO NOT change the loot rules after the fight. Stick to your guns. If you have people there that you regularily see, do a spam rolling. (I.e. Guild only raid, allies) If you have people that you are apprehensive about, I suggest this: Call and link the item and ask for everyone that can use it as an upgrade send you a tell. Assign each tell in order by a number. Don't respond to the tell, but start typing the number into the raid channel with the name. It should look like this:<br>
/1 Ossian 1 soandso 2 me 3 you 4 etc.<br>
<br>
Make a final call for people to send you a tell and repeat the numbers when someone has been added. Roll 1-however many people you have numbers for and the corresponding number wins. This server 2 purposes. First, you avoid the roll spam where it is hard to keep track of who won or rolled twice. Second, it is fair because people know that you aren't just handing it out to someone you like. No one can argue with the fairness of a random roll.<br>
<br>
I hope there is some good info in the ramble. I apologize for the bad spelling and run on sentances. it is 3 am  <br>

<br>
i don't know if it's considered an exploit still or since there was code made against it then it's obviously not an explioit just a hurdle but higher lvl characters CAN help kill vox / naggy<br>
<br>
origianlly for those that remember far back enough there was no lvl cap on vox.. with the lvl cap raised to 60 it was then implimented as a way to keep &quot;farming&quot; down and these mobs somewhat more available<br>
<br>
after that there was a nerf to wizard rain spells (a rain will always be resisted if the mob is 10% or lower in health).. this coding was put in to prevent wizards from binding there.. casting rain.. being banished.. then gating back to cast rain again to farm vox<br>
<br>
you can't kill vox this way.. HOWEVER.. all classes can use this system no matter what lvl you are to get vox to 10% in the first place so that your raid force can then kill it afterwards.. i think.. i havn't seen a post yet that simply says flat out you will be resisted.. all chars can cast.. DoT etc etc then they will be banished.. <br>
<br>
just a thought you might want to look into  <br>

We are in desperate need of more melees,enchanters,bards,and maybe two more clerics and another wizzy or two.<br>
This list isnt including all the too high lvl to fight vox chars that will be there for support.<br>

A lot of people will bitch but it will get the message out.  Also somethings we had to do was send runners out a couple hours before raid...they visit most pouplated zone and give general info and a contact name.  Be ready to explain loot rules, (number one question).  We were able to get a couple pick up raids in this manner. <p>Lyrax Cantare'Amo <br>
