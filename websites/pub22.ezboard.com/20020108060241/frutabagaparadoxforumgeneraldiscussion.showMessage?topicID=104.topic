Hope it gives you and the other necros here an insight into your pet.<br>
<br>
<br>
Yes I really think that my pet is a moron, as well I think that he is out to get me. Maybe when I get to a higher level my pet will have more respect for my untapped power (/e rolls eyes).<br>
<br>
It all started the other day when I decided to hit the Highwaymen (from now own I'll refer to them as HM's) in EK. Being a happy and gifted Necromancer, I had found that I could gain my level 12 faster if I decided to go and fight the HM's. As well there were very little threats in the immediate area that I had to worry about.<br>
<br>
<br>
So off I go up the ramp to HPH to the first of 3 mighty Towers (from now on to be refered to T1, lower ramp, to T3* upper part of ramp). <br>
<br>
So I slip in to ek unoticed to those that are unfortunate not to se an invisible person, figuring I'll apppear when I get away from some of the dangers that lay near me. I cast my pet spell and a nice high blue pet apears out of nowhere. &quot;Great&quot;, I think now to hit my first target.<br>
<br>
&quot;Pet Attack&quot;, I screamed. And off my pet ran to T1, his litle bare (and naked I might add) bottom swinging as he plunges in for the kill. A second after he takes off I cast my Lifetap and hit the target a second before my pet reaches him, then off I go to melee him. Being a trained necro I realized early on that it wasn't worth casting a drain on an enemy until I lost the same amount of health as the spell took off him.<br>
<br>
&quot;BANG&quot;, &quot;POW&quot;,&quot;KABLAAM&quot;, down he goes. &quot;Wow&quot;, that wasn't that hard, had looked and was missing a bit of health and my mana was down 1 Bubble. &quot;Pet Health, &quot;93 percent&quot;, &quot;Cool&quot;, I think. So I figure that I don't need to med and my pet will be at full health when we reach T2.<br>
<br>
Off we go following as close to the wall as we can, as lag can make you a splatter on the bottom of the cliffs if you're not careful. We arrive, nearly full mana and health has gone down a bit from my dark pact spell trading hp for mana. <br>
<br>
I see that this tower is offering me a bandit. &quot;Pet Attack&quot;, ........ ????, &quot;Pet Attack&quot;, ........ huh????. I take a quick look around and notice that my pet is nowhere to be seen. &quot;DOH&quot;, I figured that I may have told him to sit after the other attack and forgot him at the other tower without telling him to follow. <br>
<br>
Yes I do this often, the most stupidest was when I zoned into wk from nk, cast a pet then got into a fight with a griz near the zone took a beating, but survived. pet and I both sat and then I took of to group with a bandit farm group. I arrived and they asked me to get my pet ready when i realized that I left him 10 mintues behind me. No, I didn't go back , just got rid of him and then cast another.<br>
<br>
Well anyways I arrive back at the tower where I had killed the HM, nope no pile of bones to be seen. So then I figure that he has wandered off like his past siblings have done to me. I bathe and don't stink so I have no idea why they don't want to stick around me.<br>
<br>
I start following the ramp's edge heading up all the time yelling &quot;PET FOLLOW ME&quot;, with no luck hearing his reply of &quot;following master&quot;. Hmmm.... I get to T2 with no luck then head back down on a hunch that he'll be around there. I get to the bottom of the ramp and turn right figuring I'll look on the lower path when all of a sudden a white blur rushes by me. I turn and see my pet standing behind me. <br>
<br>
I stand there a bit and scratch my head, then shrug my shoulders and figure I'll hit T1 again. Making sure the pet is with me, we both descend on the unsuspecting HM with a vengance. He never knew what hit him. <br>
<br>
I decide then to hit T2 again, this time ensuring that my pet is following me all the way. As it turns out he was walking about 50ft above me alond the wall, which I didn't care as long as he was there when I needed him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Pet Attack&quot;, &quot;Taunting Attacker&quot;, I cast my spell and join him in a melee with the enemy. he's down almost as fast as the other one. I figure we should rest a bit and then head to t1. &quot;pet sit down&quot;...., ??? &quot;Pet follow me&quot;...... huh?, &quot;oh man not again&quot;. Off I go running to the bottom of the ramp.<br>
<br>
On my way down a druid is offering a free necklace at the bridge to anyone, I'm running on a cliff and am not about to respond when just then &quot;Taunting Attacker&quot;, &quot;uh oh&quot;, great, my pets attack some god foresaken thing and more than likely it's 50 feet tall and ugly. I'm on my way to the bridge when I calculate that I got enough time to ge the necklace and zone before anything happens. I tell the person that if it is available I would like to take it. He says &quot;Yes&quot; and he's at the bridge. &quot;perfect&quot;, mean while my pets still attacking whatever it is but then he stops telling me this, man he died. &quot;nearly there&quot;. <br>
<br>
I get to the botom of the ramp and shout to the zone &quot;train to bridge and I'm not certian what it is&quot;, and quickly explain about my pet and his own wanderings. Which the zone is somewhat aware of as I asked the zone to keep and eye out for him the first time. I arrive on the bridge and recieve the necklace. I bow and thank the druid, and tell him to be on the lookout for a mob which will be zeroing in on me soon. We both keep watch when someone shouts &quot;Droon to bridge&quot; I start shaking having realized that if I hadn't of ran in the first palce I would be a permanent stain in the landscape. Just then I see the beast. one second and zone the next. <br>
<br>
Anyways I zone in ek after a bit and realize that I used the last of my bone chips on the last pet, so I give a ooc that I'm looking to buy a couple of bc's (not stacks) to get my pet up and running. I get a tell from Feilong (a monk if I remember right) that he has 36 but, he is at the zone to HPH and will only be on for another 10 min, I tell him I'll be right there and then I get a spirit of wolf cast on me form the same one that gave me the necklace. I thank him for all he has done and take off back up the ramp (with no pet thank god). I arrive and get the bc's and he ask's what armor I'm wearing and tell him that it is mostly the same from my level 2 days, he offers to make some Raw-silk armor for me and I tell him that I don't have the pp to pay, but offered to buy them when i get enough. He says he will and I part (I will get the armor off you feilong and I owe you for the bc's, any favor I can do for you that is within my means is yours).<br>
<br>
So off to T3 with a new supply of bc's in hand. I get near T3 and figure it's safe to cast my pet again. Nice and blue, just the way I like them. We again attack and take the bandit ( always one in a tower here i guess) out. Just then I decide to take a look at my pet and tell him to follow me. he says &quot;following master&quot; and then turns and runs off the cliff. ??????? ummmmm....... I just stand there for 30 secs or so looking dumbfounded. Then for the heck off it I ask my pet to follow me, when I get a message saying &quot;You have no pet to command&quot;, ???? WHAT? then it dawns on me that my pet just commited suicide. <br>
<br>
I didn't think that an undead could get depressed but I guess so, guess verant thought of a lot of things to include in the game.<br>
<br>
Well this sin't going to detter me any, so I fgured out a plan that would work and wouldn't waste any pets doing it.<br>
<br>
I decided to get between T1 and T2 and within sight of both, against the wall I cast my pet spell. The second that he appeared I told him to sit. I then headed off to T1 and cast clinging darkness on the HM there. I ran back to my pet and waited for the mob to arrive I let him hit me then backed off as my pet engaged the enemy. Before the HM's body had a chance to hit the ground after dieing I told my pet to sit. Then just repeated the steps for T2. <br>
<br>
So upn reflecting on everything in the end I ended up pulling the mobs for my pet instead of a tank. go figure, a reversal of roles.  <br>
