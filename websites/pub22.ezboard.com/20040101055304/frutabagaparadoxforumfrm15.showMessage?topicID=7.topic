Not EQ related.</span><hr size=1> &quot;Not.  Getting.  Married&quot; Solveig muttered under her breath as she hacked at her long braids with a knife she'd picked up while storming through the kitchen.  She'd spent most of the day fuming and furiously putting the final touches on the event that she'd been planning for the previous two weeks.  This morning, after a heated discussion with her father on the subject of her future, she decided it had to be tonight, or never.  <br>
<br>
When Solveig was thirteen, her father had arranged for her to be married to a man over thrice her age, the middle aged lord of a neighbouring county.  The man had been married twice before, and both of his wives were dead before they reached the age of twenty-six.  One died with her child while giving birth, and the other threw herself from one of the tower windows.  Soveig was approaching twenty, her marriage was to occur on her twentieth birthday and she was determined that she wouldn't meet the same fate.  <br>
<br>
Ever since she had reached the age of thirteen, she had been taking secret sword fighting lessons from the sword master's widow, a tiny woman, but superbly skilled in her art.  Her father had expressly forbidden her from her passion, but after growing up with four older brothers, and following in their footsteps all of her childhood, Solveig had no desire to stop.  She hid her long hair underneath her helm, strapped her breasts down under her chain shirt, and took lessons under the name she preferred, Sol, as a boy.  <br>
<br>
As she advanced into her teens, Sol became a strong, imposing presence, even in her courtiers' costume, which she loathed.  The only effect the fussy corset and frilly veils had on her was to make her look uncomfortable.  She undertook etiquette lessons from the day her father arranged her marriage, and over the years, she continued with her riding lessons.  Her giant ancestry saw her at well over 6 feet tall, and she was broad and well muscled.  She was more at home wearing leather breeches and grooming her mount than she ever was acting the dutiful daughter in her father's court.<br>
<br>
Only her long time friend Bran, the son of a ranger in her father's employ knew of her secret.  He had helped her get in and out of her father's house when she was to see the sword master's widow, and he taught her how to use a longbow.  She would never be as good as him, but she rarely ever fumbled with it either.  To repay him for his friendship, Sol passed her swordsmanship onto Sven. <br>
<br>
Sol contemplated her appearance.  Her angular face betrayed just the very traces of femininity, the lack of an adams apple on her throat was easily hidden by a hooded overshirt.  She inspected her new short hair from as many angles as she could.  It wasn't perfect, but it wasn't Solveig either.  <br>
<br>
A noise in the hallway outside her room made her jump and swing wildly towards the door.  Heart pounding she pressed an ear to the heavy door and listened intently.  She could hear her father's old housemaid shuffling up the hallway towards the servants quarters.  That meant her father had gone to bed, and the house was quiet.  <br>
<br>
Moving quickly and quietly Sol gathered up her discarded hair and stuffed it into a slit she made on the underside of her lumpy mattress, then wrapped the linen bandages around her chest, and threw on her undershirt and woollen overshirt.  Her chain shirt was hidden in the stable, along with the rest of her armour, her bastard sword, her bow, a quiver full of arrows, 2 saddlebags filled with bread, dried meats and honey mead from the kitchen and a bag of gold pieces that she'd saved up.  She wasn't taking anything from the house with her, she didn't want to risk the noise waking her father or her brothers.<br>
<br>
Sol pulled open her heavy door, stopping motionless as it creaked on its hinges.  For a few breathless moments she froze there like a rabbit, alert, listening.  Finally she was satisfied that the noise hadn't woken anyone, and without closing the door behind her she sprinted down the hallway in her hosed feet, down the stairs two at a time, avoiding the squeaky one, and slipped out of the front door.  Pulling her boots on as she ran over the hard frozen ground, she headed for the stable.  No one noticed the tall shadow making it's way gracefully and rapidly across the grounds.  No one noticed the shadow that lurked in the woods just outside the walls of the household.<br>
<br>
Sol quickly saddled up her horse, soothing him as he shuffled on his feet and nuzzled her hands, whinnying softly.  She didn't want to wake the other horses.  She attached the heavy saddlebags, pulled the chain shirt over her clothes and laced up her boots.  Settling her sword in it's sheath around her waist, and her bow and quiver across her back, she pulled up the hood on her woollen shirt, led her horse from the stable and made her way hastily to the gates of her soon to be former home.  The shadow lurking in the forest met her there.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Do you have everything, Lady?&quot;  The shadow whispered in the darkness.<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't call me that again Bran, I'm not her anymore.  I'm just Sol.&quot; She whispered back.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Of course.  Habit.&quot; she could see his white teeth as he grinned.  His horse shifted feet underneath him and snorted.<br>
<br>
&quot;Are the others waiting?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, just outside the town&quot; he replied<br>
<br>
&quot;Good&quot; She hauled her large frame onto her horse and dug her heels into his belly &quot;let's move then.  I want to be as far from this place by dawn as I can be&quot;<br>
<br>
No one noticed as they rode through the town, it was not unusual to see a couple of horsemen late at night.  The town was a major point on the northern road, and most travellers cut through the town to shave a few hours off their journey.  Or if they happened across the tavern, add a few hours.<br>
<br>
Sol and Bran weren't looking to stop at the tavern however.  As soon as they reached the outskirts of the township they broke into a gallop and didn't stop until they could no longer see the lights of the little town far behind them.  <br>
<br>
Pulling hard on the reins Sol brought her horse to a stop, and Bran followed.  There were two mounted figures on the road ahead of them.  Cautiously Sol approached them.  She opened her mouth to speak but before any words could come out one of the figures spoke to her.<br>
<br>
&quot;My name is Olaf&quot; he said.  Despite his obvious size he sounded young &quot;and this is Grian&quot; The shadow gestured towards the small woman behind him.  &quot;You are expecting to meet with us&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I know who you are&quot; Sol replied, feeling slightly relieved.  &quot;Thank you for joining me.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Better than execution&quot; Olaf replied, pulling his horse around and starting up the road away from the distant town.<br>
<br>
Sol and Bran kicked their horses into a fast trot and the little party rapidly left the town behind.<br>
<br>
After about two hours of riding and listening to the others engage in idle chatter Sol felt her horse beginning to tire, so she pulled him up and suggested that they move into the forest to camp for the night.  They setup camp in a small clearing a few hundred metres off the road, and Sol offered to keep watch while the others slept.  She was running on too much adrenaline to even contemplate sleeping.  She fed and watered the horses and brushed them down before settling down in front of the fire with her sword and a whetstone.<br>
<br>
Morning dawned bright and early and Sol squinted into the rising sunshine sleepily.  Her sword could have cut down the shaft of a hair, it had been such an uneventful watch.  She nudged the rest of her party and moved off to prepare the horses while they roused themselves.  Olaf struggled to his feet rubbing his belly. <br>
<br>
&quot;Hungry&quot; he complained pulling out some dried meat and bread from his pack.  He washed down the few mouthfuls with a swig from a skin of ale.  Unsatisfied with his meagre meal he pulled out his sling and looked around for something to cook. <br>
<br>
Spotting a bird high in the trees a little way away he took aim and swung his sling over his head.  The stone hurtled through the air, missed the bird, which took off with a startled squawk, and fell into the trees.<br>
<br>
Suddenly the air was filled with a yell from the direction in which Olaf's stone had fallen.<br>
<br>
&quot;OOOOWWW&quot;<br>
<br>
Sol abandoned her horse and ran for the sound, with the other three following closely on her heels.  A hundred metres or so from their camp she stumbled across the source of the noise.  A small, thin man  in a blue robe lay on the ground holding his knee and moaning in pain.  Beside him was the stone that Olaf had pitched at the bird.<br>
<br>
'Well well&quot; snorted Olaf.  &quot;A little man in a dress&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Hush you&quot; said Grian shooting him a withering look. &quot;You hurt him&quot; She knelt beside the small man and gently lifted his hands from his injured knee.  From where Sol was standing she could see the  large bruise forming and suspected that the impact had fractured the man's kneecap.<br>
&quot;What's your name&quot; Bran enquired<br>
The small man gulped and looked up at him.<br>
&quot;B-bettik,&quot; he hiccuped.<br>
<br>
<br>
