FUA-Q**READ BEFORE APPLYING**</span><hr size=1> Frequently Un-asked Questions!<br>
<br>
If you haven't guessed by now, we're not a normal guild.  The truth is, we never wanted to have a normal guild.  That would make us just a carbon copy of other EQ guilds and cloning, while interesting...  isn't my forte.  So, to heck with all that.  <br>
<br>
Often imitated by others, but NEVER duplicated, we're Rutabaga Paradox and here to have fun and make fun of EQ, of human nature, and of stupidty in MMORPGs (your stupidity and mine) Oh yeah, and sometimes we kill stuff too!  We have a couple of rules.<br>
<br>
So if you're still interested, keep reading our FUA-Q:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong> Our Mission</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
We're not here to just conquer MOBS.  We're here to conquer the players.  When all is said and done, the only thing people really remember about any guild isn't the tournaments they've won...  it's not the dungeons they've conquered.  What is remembered, is whether or not their members were fun to interact with, or if they were a bunch of flaming whining snively jerks.  Uhm.. in case you're wondering, we want to be the good guys, not the jerks.<br>
<br>
No matter if you're a level 6 wizard with a rusty dagger, or a level 65 warrior heading into the Plane of Time...   No matter if you have a CoF, an RBB, an STD, a rezz-stick, a glow-stick or a dip-stick.  We as Rutabagas should never be of the mindset that we're above consequence or beyond reproach of the people we interact with.  No matter how far we succeed, it's my hope that we'll always have the right mix of humor with humility.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>I'm afraid of clowns that wear rubbber noses and weild gas powered chainsaws.  Is that bad?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
As for those with phobias, those with xeno or homo need not apply, but agora and triskadeca are welcome (and know we never have raids with exactly 13 people in them!)<br>
<br>
We also accept people with some obsessive compulsive disorders.<br>
We also accept people with some obsessive compulsive disorders.<br>
We also accept people with some obsessive compulsive disorders.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong> What level do I need to be?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
You can ask what our level requirement is, and we'll tell you that there isn't one. We won't turn away people based on level.  We don't care if you have your epic or not.  There is however, a personality requirement.  We want people with a good additude and positive reputation for helping others and a thick emotional skin.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>On my first week in Rutabaga, someone said the word &quot;poop&quot; in guildchat!&quot;</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
In the past, guildchat has sometimes grazed on adult themes and subjects.  ... because most of us are adults, but we have been known to make arses of ourselves without causing any harm to anyone (except to ourselves).  In the past, guildchat has rarely ever touched on the subject of a type of liquid that isn't milk, spurting out from an bodily orafice which isn't a nose,  but that doesn't mean that guildchat wouldn't ever go there.   I'm not excited when people leave over something said in guildchat, because I'm looking for polite and fun loving people who normally don't talk garbage, but aren't going to freak out if they read it either.<br>
<br>
... hokay, moving on!<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>How do I get ahold of the people to get initiated into your guild?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
You need to post in our forum and have some time to develop a good reputation and rapport with your Rutabagas and others on the server.  Your reputation is earned, good or bad.  If you are looking to apply to the guild, please post in this application forum and include the phrase &quot;really really looking forward to&quot; your introduction post.  Be creative on what it is that you're looking forward to, but do not refer to joining the guild when you use that phrase.  Secondly, join our chat channel druzzil.snortimgmilk:rutabaga and get to know rutabagas and friends of rutabagas from around the server and on other servers.<br>
<br>
We don't care how much your equipment is worth.  We don't care if your main is in some uber guild.  It would be nice if you joined us, if you actually played with us (haha!) but honestly, I just want you to have a good time in EverQuest no matter whatlevel/race/class combo you have.<br>
<br>
Let me be frank, (even though my name isn't Frank) here is what we care about.<br>
<br>
-If you like to interact with people.  <br>
<br>
-If you're creative, generous, charismatic and diplomatic, but don't take this game too seriously. <br>
<br>
- If you seek laughs and everlasting friendship beyond the boarders of levels and loot.<br>
<br>
-If you can make fun of yourself better than anyone else.<br>
<br>
- If you can type a complete sentence once in a while.<br>
<br>
- If you can put up with the worst jokes and puns in the world and possibly spin some of your own.<br>
<br>
... you could quite possibly be a Rutabaga.  <br>
<br>
Things we don't tolerate:  (here's where I sound stern, ... almost just like a REAL guildleader, kids!  Tee hee!)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Does NE 1 have NE thing 4 a midlevel monk?  I don't have ne money!1</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Begging - Not in guild chat, not in tells, not in say, not, nope, nada, never.  We have goodwill towards our fellow player, but that doesn't mean that we *are* the Goodwill.  It also doesn't mean that anyone in the Bazaar is the Goodwill either.  There is a difference between making an ass of yourself to make people have fun, and just being an ass.  So don't beg.  That's your one and only warning.  <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>What is the trout of doom and the Milk Backwards Punishment?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Milk backwards punishment:  If I catch a tale of anyone with a Rutabaga Paradox tag begging, or doing anything that would cause people to look upon us in a bad light, we'll probably kick you out.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Can I just hold your stuff?  I've never seen what 5k platinum looks like!</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
No, but would you like to see what my foot up your backside looks like?  Scamming - *we don't carry &quot;little brother&quot; coverage on the guild's reputation insurance policy.  * please see Milk Backwards punishment for details.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>OMG Hoss sux tehy killed teh speeper and now I can't ever go to NTOV! or plane of time and get my rolex of uberness!!<br>
</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Guild Bashing - We're an equal opportunity wacky guild, from big to small.  So lets leave the server politics out, and please just enjoy each other's company.  There's plenty that you can do to beat EQ without getting past level 5.<br>
   <br>
More questions!<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Nobody responded to my post, do I have onion breath?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  <br>
Maybe, or maybe you either put it all in a runon sentence that we can't read, or ... who knows?  Be sincere.  Try again!<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>I'm accepted, what now?&quot;</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Once you are accepted, please be sure to contact an officer in game.  It will be your responsibility to run to them to get tagged.  <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Can I tag all of my alts?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
After a month of being a Rutabaga, you can tag your alts.  Don't perster officers before that month is up, or they will fart in your general direction.... and Kyur is a college student.  Think of all the beer and fast food those darn kids consume!  Trust me, it's safer to just wait out the month and enjoy your brainwashing.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>How do I find out about all the cool stuff happening?!</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  Most of it is spur of the moment.  Everything from Quacking in POK to Spinning in the nexus, was all stuff that &quot;just happened&quot;.  However, it can't hurt to keep an eye on guildchat and the private boards for an indication of what's up.  Amidst our babble, there is sometimes useful information!<br>
<br>
If you are detagging from another guild, hopefully you have already done so.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I graciously thank you for reading this, and I wish you luck and fortune!<br>

FUA-Q**READ BEFORE APPLYIN</span><hr size=1> Hey all,<br>
<br>
I was playing my alt in Unrest this morning &quot;Silverlady&quot; when I ran into a short little Pally named Kolanari. He said he would help me lvl a bit. Then his friend Ukei came there. After getting flattened several times by the trains they would bring for me to fight, they finally decided I needed a few buffs...<br>
It was a little better after that... I made 17 lvls and 15Kpp in the next 2 hours with them helping... well, not really.<br>
I would like to have my main join Rutabaga. His name is <br>
Crozar Wolfsoul. He is a lvl49 Ranger, killer of all things small and furry, Terror of BlackBurrow.<br>
<br>
Love to eat them Gnollies, Gnollies what I love to eat,<br>
Bite they little heads off, nibble on they tiny feet.<br>
