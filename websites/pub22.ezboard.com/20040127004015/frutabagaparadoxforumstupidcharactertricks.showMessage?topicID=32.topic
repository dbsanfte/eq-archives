<br>
Spend most of my time in 80% or 100% guild groups. <br>
<br>
I can trust my guildmates. <br>
<br>
they'll die for me, I'll die for them (I'm a cleric, they prefer to die for me, since I've got the rezzes)<br>
<br>
But, my alt is a warrior.. we don't have enough low-level presence in the guild to make a full gorup at that level, so I play in pick-up groups most of the time. <br>
<br>
I recently levelled to 15, and decided to move from the derv camps onto the Orc Highway..  <br>
<br>
Well, the orc highway is a wonderful place, with tons of white and yellow and red mobs, and lots of fun people to group with!<br>
<br>
fun people who are far too low level to be grouping there, and bloody cowards in any case. <br>
<br>
Case in point: I was pulling, so I meaunder out into the highway and drop my line. I pull a red orc warrior, but our group could have easily taken him. However, the two priests and assorted other reds I brought with him changed that, so I announced that I was running this to zone, and I'd be right back..   as I swung nearest my group... <br>
<br>
<br>
they jumped out and started attacking mobs. <br>
<br>
we lost a level 9 enchanter, and I managed to get aggro properly managed (meaning that everything was hitting me). I started calling for the group to assist me, PLEASE.<br>
<br>
and I see our level 17 paladin pull an orc warrior that's blue to me, freak out, and start running.<br>
<br>
no clue where the druid was<br>
or the SK<br>
or any other member of the !@#!@# group.<br>
<br>
I died.<br>
<br>
on my way back I picked up an orc from the desert..  announced I was bringing a friend. I get there, and they're in the middle of combat, so I run the guy around a wee bit, and when they finish with their current mob...   they pull another.<br>
<br>
ignoring my frantic cries for help, I ran, and watched my HP drop, and died..  <br>
<br>
I disbanded the group when I popped back into freeport.<br>
<br>
I hate pickup groups. <p>---

<br>
hehe.  And of course, sometimes I do a good job, sometimes I don't.  <br>
<br>
But it's that dynamic mish mash of people that makes it kind of fun.  You never know what you're gonna pick up.  You really get to know what different classes are capable of because you usually have to fill a functional gap of some sort.<br>
<br>
Oh, but Oasis is a definite proving ground.  Not a friendly place if you have people who don't know what they're doing. <p>--------------------------------------------------<BR>

How can you not like pick up groups??? =) I LooOooooOOOOooOOOOoOOOoVe pick up groups...hehe.<br>
For example..when I was high enough of a level to know alot about my class...I started to form my own groups. Compared to how my pally sister pulls..it seems like they just pull one mob at a time, which by the way looks really boring to me, ugh. This is the secret to liking it I guess: I am always leader (SK), I have a main tank (taunter), a chanter/bard, a healer (1 cleric if not, 2 druids/shaman combo), a nuker, buffer. I try to make it that formula so I can chain pull like crazy...oh and you must be jboot-equipped w/ some kind of FD/circlet of shadows kind of thing. You must be outdoors and know where to pull mobs...<br>
Alot of people who have been in my groups say that they haven't seen that kind of pulling before..which is weird because I thought most people knew how to do that since it was so natural to orchestrate. A guildie of mine once said (I was grouped with him) that our group was just good and that a stupid group couldn't pull a stunt like that, but he doesn't know that I've done this method of pulling in every group I've been in and it worked everytime, except of course when we're unbalanced when there are no clerics or clarity/manasong, then it's a little slower. I don't know, but it's just fun as hell pulling for a group I lub it =P The only times I've hated groups was when I didn't pull..or when they were really boring..or when someone objects to my pulling because they got scared. =( <p><br>

With my 3 alts I have had only one good exprince in Oasis.  A good but boring place to level 13-18 is Siren Sprials in OOT.  There are 3 Sirens all lvl 13 and no faction hits.  All you need is a way to break a spawn then its wack wack wack and exp flows in.  I went from 13-18 in less then 2 days with my bard. And 14-18 in one day with my druid.  <br>
As for pick up groups, for the most part I like em. The reason is because i get to meet new ppl.  I like talking to others and helping ppl out so group with diffrent ppl gets me a chance to do that.  Also it is fun to play my bard and hear ppl say, &quot;damn i didn't know bards were so powerful/ or/ how did you do that with a bard&quot;.  Hee i do love my bard, can you tell?<br>

If I have time to play more than a couple hours at a stretch and I have the patience to deal with people.  I find this is a good way to learn different ways of doing things and to meet new people.  I do find leading groups to be tiring, the constant little squabbles and recruiting that needs to be done to keep a group going.  <br>
<br>
I think a good group leader is one that keeps the group going through the constant renewal of it.  Recruiting for groups is the hardest part, it is always a challenge to find people with the constant churn of people out of the group.  <br>
<br>
However, most times I don't have the time to be on for more than a two hour period so I will look to my guildmates for a quick group.  I have not asked but I hope that they don't mind my quick diving in and out of their groups.  <br>
