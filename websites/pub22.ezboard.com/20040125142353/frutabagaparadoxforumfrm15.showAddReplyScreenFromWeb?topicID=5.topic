<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>The Last Darkpaw</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
As the sun rose over the hills outside the city of Qeynos, three brothers tore down their camp from the night before. Kraxks, Djerr and Nixx Darkpaw were on the hunt. They searched for the Humans that had murdered their brother Fippy’s entire family. Fippy should have been with them, but he had made a suicidal charge at the Qeynos North Gate. Now they were the only survivors of a litter of eight. A slight wind rolled out of the hills to the East, coming off the Plains of Karana. With it came the scent of Man. Djerr lifted his canine snout into the wind and took a long breath in to catch as much of the scent as possible. His finely tuned sense of smell easily picked out three distinct scents. One he didn’t know, another he did and the third was blood. He spoke in the guttural language of the Gnolls. <br>
<br>
“I smell a man. And blood. And Holly Windstalker!” <br>
<br>
His brothers started at the name of the woman. She was famous as a hunter and slayer of the Gnolls of Clan Darkpaw. She mercilessly slaughtered any that she found in the hills and was the prime suspect for the latest rash of murders. The three brothers looked at each other for a moment before nodding in mutual agreement and setting off in the direction Djerr indicated. <br>
<br>
As they got closer to the origins of the smells, they began hearing the ring and clash of weapons in combat. They began to run towards the fight in the hopes that their clan mates had managed to surprise her. Cresting a hill they looked into a small ravine cutting in between the hills. What they saw was a bit of a shock, instead of their kin, they found the source of the man smell. <br>
<br>
He was tall with ebony skin and something of a fluid grace. His armor was made of steel plates and dyed black on the chest, arms, legs and helm. The wrist guards and boots had been dyed red. His opponent on the other hand was short, lithe and dressed in the brown and green leathers one would expect to find on a Ranger of Tunare, the Mother of All. Wielding two short swords one in either hand, Holly Windstalker danced around her much larger opponent opening little gashes on his legs, arms and chest. Yet, he was winning. He would shout a quick incantation between swings of his giant axe that would stagger the woman just long enough for him to strike while his own minor wounds closed. <br>
<br>
The Gnolls watched for several minutes as the stranger and Holly struck, parried, riposted and shouted out various incantations in an attempt to get a solid advantage. Finally, it happened. A brutal attack from the man with his axe had left Holly reeling. Another quick incantation and she was surrounded by a green mist and stumbled to her knees. The fight was over. A single swipe from his axe and she was dead. <br>
The three brothers were overjoyed to see their greatest foe fall like that and started down the hill to confront this stranger. <br>
<br>
The sound of snapping twigs and crackling leaves was the only warning of the approaching intruders. Itdano Thimtraver looked up to see who dared disturb him at a time like this. No one could be so foolish. Well, no one except the Gnolls of Clan Darkpaw. There they were, three of the disgusting dog-like creatures. Their leather armor and bronze weapons proclaimed them to be high ranking members of the Darkpaw clan. What they were doing out of their ancestral home, a series of caves, tunnels and underwater streams known as Blackburrow was another story, one that Itdano would soon become acquainted with whether he liked it or not. <br>
<br>
Their harsh and guttural language spewed forth in a torrent of barks, growls and whines that Itdano understood perfectly. Itdano glanced down at the woman’s corpse at his feet with some regret. He may have hated and feared Holly Windstalker, but he had great respect for her, and they had one thing in common. One thing only, they both hated Gnolls. <br>
<br>
“Hail stranger!” the first of them shouted before he was even halfway down the hill. <br>
<br>
Itdano stood up and slowly turned to face the three beasts. <br>
<br>
“Hail yourself. What do you want of me, beast?” Itdano replied. <br>
<br>
“Why we want to thank you for ridding us of that horrible woman. Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Djerr Darkpaw and these are my brothers Nixx and Kraxks. We have been hunting her for some days now to exact our revenge on our lost brother’s behalf. Well, him and his little ones.” Djerr tried to ignore the minor insult, but being called a beast grated on him. <br>
<br>
“Well dog, I didn’t do it for you, I did it for me.” said Itdano thinking back to his childhood. His father use to take him mammoth hunting. The problem was they had to travel through these hills to get into the Everfrost Peaks. There was a warrant out for his father’s arrest in Qeynos and Holly insisted on trying to cash in on it. This meant lots of hiding in bushes and sneaking around by night to avoid her. Something a proud child like Itdano simply couldn’t stomach. She had made his childhood a living hell, stalking his nightmares while at home, and stalking him for real whenever he was in this area. This time, he’d led her into a trap. <br>
<br>
With a little sigh and a last kick to Holly’s ribs, Itdano picked up his axe off the ground. Still stained with the blood of the Ranger that had haunted his dreams for years, the axe had served him well. It was double edged with a handle that was at least as long as a man’s arm, wrapped in good leather at the bottom to provide a solid grip. As he lifted it power seemed to awake within it and small runes on its blade and haft began to pulse with a dark light while Itdano’s weariness seemed to drop away. <br>
This time, the name calling had gone too far. Their canine ancestry had been left in the past. While they resembled them on the surface, these were much more complex and dangerous creatures. They had all the advantages a dog, better hearing, better sense of smell, the ability to heal quickly, fur to cover them during the cold months and strong sense of family. They also had all the advantages of humans, high intelligence, upright body posture and fully formed hands that could easily create, grasp and use tools. <br>
Djerr drew his sword first with an angry glint to his eye. <br>
<br>
“A warning human. Do not call me dog, beast, thing or anything other than my name. Do you understand me?” <br>
<br>
Itdano chuckled. This was almost cute! The puppy dog wanted to bite him! “Very well”, he thought with a smile. “Let’s see what you’ve got.” <br>
<br>
A simple wave of his hand and hefting of his axe had them moving forward. The one on the left moved first. A quick thrust with his sword that was easily deflected. Of course, the purpose was not to strike, but to draw the weapon out of line for Nixx to apply the finishing blow. Against a less skilled opponent, it could have worked. Against an ordinary man wielding a Mythril Edged Skull Splitter, they had no chance. Itdano Thimtraver was no ordinary man, and the ploy did not succeed, though only Djerr knew that. Kraxks and Nixx were already dead. The last Gnoll, so full of confidence less than ten seconds earlier now started running. Feeling good about having destroyed the only thing he had left to fear, Itdano decided he would play a little. He began casting a spell that would slow the beast down. <br>
Djerr couldn’t understand what was happening. He saw his brothers rush in the same as they always have. He felt more than saw the man’s axe come up and begin to twirl. Then he saw Nixx felled by a huge gash to his chest and Kraxks lost his head on the return swing of the same blow! Panicking, Djerr turned to run for the safety of his caves. Little did he know it was too late. He heard the shouted incantation just before he felt a stab of pain and suddenly retched as he stumbled to a halt. He heard the strange man begin another spell and as he lay there he could feel his heart speed up and his blood begin to boil. <br>
<br>
This was not good. <br>
<br>
He staggered to his feet and began running again but it felt as though he were in hip deep mud. He could barely move. Not knowing what else to do, he turned to face his opponent. He saw that the man had not even moved and had already begun to cast another spell. As the man finished his chant, Djerr felt a fear like he had never felt before. He knew with certainty that if he didn’t get back home everyone would be killed. He also knew that to run home would lead this man to Blackburrow. He tried to fight it, but couldn’t. He turned to run again. He could hear the man laughing now. He was mad! <br>
<br>
Djerr still couldn’t believe this was happening to him. He could barely move and was running slowly and against his will towards his only home with a madman in pursuit. His home, where his own litter was safely tucked into their beds and his wife was waiting patiently for him to return from the hunt. Where his father sat sadly in his throne room awaiting word from his only remaining sons. Now it was just one son. What would he say to his father? What could he say? The thought enraged him so much that he finally overcame his fear of the madman and turned to face him one last time. Weakly he drew his sword. His body was failing him, he could hardly move, his blood screamed in his veins and his heart was threatening to burst as each second ticked slowly by. Through pain and tear filled eyes he saw that the man had begun following him and almost seemed surprised to see Djerr in front of him. Not surprised enough though. He simply shifted his axe again and came for the young Gnoll. Djerr managed to parry the first three blows and was beginning to think he might have a chance when the axe took his left arm. As he crumpled to the ground, all he could think was that he had failed to avenge his brothers, but at least he didn’t lead the man to Blackburrow. <br>
<br>
Itdano leaned down to speak softly into Djerr’s ear. <br>
<br>
“Don’t worry, dog. The Gnolls of Clan Darkpaw don’t have anything to fear from me. Not anymore.” <br>
<br>
Grinning wickedly, he rose back up to his full height and brought his axe above his head for a final blow. <br>
<br>
“They screamed for me you know. Your father and mother. Your grandparents. Probably your wife too. The children felt nothing. I killed them quickly. You can rest easy knowing that.” <br>
<br>
The axe fell, and Cazic Thule, the God of Fear, sat in his home plane and smiled down at his minion. He would soon be ready.<br>
