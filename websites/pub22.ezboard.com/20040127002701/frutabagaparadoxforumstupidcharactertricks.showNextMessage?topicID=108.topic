<br>
We've all done stupid things.  There are endless ways to forget your brain, screw up, get yourself or other people killed, and end up naked next to the soulbinder.  Here's a few examples of just how things can go all pear-shaped.<br>
Most of this happened with my characters, mostly my bard, on another server, which shall remain unnamed to protect the stupid (me).... but it begins with a Q.  <br>
The specific act(s) of stupidity is/are marked by an *.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>1) An individual getting themselves killed:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
This is perhaps the most just and least offensive form of stupidity.  <br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">A) AFK kind of stupid</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->: I've sent most of my characters through Kurn's Tower in the teens, at least since PoP came out.  My last guy to slog through there went afk 'just for a second' at the zone entrance* and got trampled by a train of apparently everything in the basement.  Bam - naked next to Jera again.  A kind of stupid everyone has done - but you'd think I would've learned after the fourth time.  <br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">B) Targeting and inattention kind of stupid:</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> I can't even remember how many times I've nuked myself*, devoured myself*, or gotten dotted to death when I wasn't paying attention*.  Common problems.  There should be a support group for people like this.  The latest was just a couple weeks ago when I zoned into Acrylia Caverns, ran smack into a caster, decided (too slowly) I was getting my arse handed to me, zoned out, and died dotted on the other side while saying something stupid like &quot;hee hee, that was NUTS!&quot; <br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">C) Keyboard kind of stupid:</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> Like many others the most valuable first tip I got was to remap my attack button.  Even so, most of my toons have melee attack as hotkey 1*.  This still gets me in trouble occasionally.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">2) An individual getting themselves killed, with help:</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline"> A) Bind point kind of stupid:</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> My level 50 druid friend talked my 12th level ranger into going with him to Iceclad to buy a spell*.  We took the boat, jawed the whole way, landed at the docks, and my friend decided it would be a good idea to bind me there, just in case anything bad happened while I was tooling around an area I had no right to be.  So I got bound.*  He got his spell, no problem, and we ported to WC.  <br>
His connection was slower than mine, so I got in first, and all I saw was a flurry of shouts and other red text, something big and yellow, and then a &quot;You have been slain by a hill giant!&quot;.  Naked next to Jera?  I wish - naked next to some gnome in Iceclad.  Within seconds it started to snow.  Then I got a group message.... &quot;Um.. where are you?&quot;  He fetched a rez for me.  On the upside - I still get to bring up &quot;that time you got me killed and I ended up naked in Iceclad in a blizzard.&quot;<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">B) Auto-follow kind of stupid part 1:</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> My dorfly friend and I decided to head out across the Dreadlands from the Luclin spires.  I whipped up a lev song for us* and we were on our way across the mountains.  I told him a few times, not wanting him to fall, that he needed to stay very close to me (although not in those words - something about his position relative to my arse...).  Sure enough, we were reminded that autofollow works for the x and y axis but not the z.  He got too far above me*... he said he took 10k hp.  Hoo rah!  A new record!  Naked next to Nansin.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">3) An individual getting the group killed:</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline"> AoE kind of stupid:</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> About a week after I started playing EQ I had my first wake up call to my awesome potential for idiocy.  Most bards have done something like this.  I was in Blackburrow, with probably my very first group, and we cleared out the top and started heading downstairs. We got some gnolls, I pulled out Chords of Dissonance*, and we got extra gnolls with gnolls on top and little gnollie sprinkles - wipeout on the stairs.  Lesson learned.  Fully clothed in North Qeynos.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">4) A few people getting everyone involved killed:</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">Training kind of stupid:</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> My buddy the SK and I were fear kiting along the south wall of KC in the Dreadlands, and doing just fine.  Somebody trained by with about 4 drolvargs - I'll call him JA.  We watched, but were busy with our own drolvarg* (granted this story is not so much stupidity as dumb bad luck, but this is where we could've run for the zone and been fine).  Well sure enough JA went down and the drolvargs headed back, and we ran into each other.  My buddy distracted them by letting them eviscerate him while I ran for KC - jumping over JA's carcass on the way.  Training into and out of KC on Qserver is generally held as 'train to the right', so that's where I ran. Lucky me - everyone was clustered at the left zone in.  Into KC I ran.  Into a train - wtf?  Back to DL.  Into another train, of brutes.  Back to KC - with arterial bleeding by this point, and my buddy, who is already naked, going, &quot;Are you dead?  where are you?&quot;  Whew.  The coast is clear in KC.  I whip out the banjo and start slapping on the ducky bandaids.  Then - you guessed it - trained.  Naked next to Nansin.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">5) Mass stupidity: the entire group/ raid being stupid and getting everyone killed:</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">A) Auto-follow kind of stupid part 2:</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> Our guild has Leezard night, with about 8-12 of us having Iksar we have leveled together.  On one of our trips across (if I recall correctly) Warsliks Woods, we all had our lead monk on auto-follow* to our next hunting site.  Suddenly he disappeared ahead of us.  Hmm... within moments we all found out why as we followed him over the cliff.  Naked in Cabilis.  <br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">B) Not keeping track of your spells part 1:</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> Our guild went for a raid into Crystal Caverns.  I've heard of this kind of stupid happening to others, so I know we aren't alone in this.  I hope.  This subset in the guild was new to raiding, so we were practicing getting coordinated, buffing everyone quickly, following orders, etc.  We got buffed up, leved, invised, and our leader gave us the lowdown, including instructions to wait 3 seconds and then follow him into the pit.  It worked flawlessly - 3 seconds after he went down every last one of us did, following him perfectly.  Too bad invis had worn off*.  As we leved to the bottom every single orc lining that pit took off to meet us there.  One of our clerics cast a heal and got swarmed - every see a nature show on pirahnas skeletonizing a cow or something in 2 minutes?  Eight seconds, tops, for the cleric.  They took a dislike to my music - second to die.  I couldn't even see my body when it was all over; too many orcs in the way.  Naked next to Jera?  Or Nansin?  I wish - naked next to Grunson.  Bummer.  Everyone died.  Some idiot bard  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   even wrote a song about it, The Ballad of Crystal Caverns, aka Paratroopers of Valor, far down on <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub31.ezboard.com/fvalorofunity38249frm1.showMessageRange?topicID=8.topic&amp;start=21&amp;stop=38" target="top">this page. </a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">6) And finally - talent to beat all talent:  the individual that gets everyone in the entire zone killed.</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  <br>
I am both relieved and a little disappointed I've never done anything this spectacularly bad.  <br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">Not keeping track of your spells part 2:</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> I was on one of many Vox raids.  We were in the king room, waiting for more folks to show up.  Against advice ( there weren't many of us yet), they started pulling ice giants.  I sighed and memmed charm.  Sure enough in a couple pulls they brought back four, which was really too many for us - but luckily we had a bard <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  I charmed one, had it attack another, and the others beat the other two down.  Eventually we got down to the last one, and although it was close I really think we would've been ok - when one of our druids cast what they thought* was a heal.  Within seconds the entirety of Vox's court came raining down on us.  Ice giants, icy terrors, the priest of Nagafen.  The druid had forgotten to swap out earthquake for his heal spell*, and basically aggroed the zone.  The priest and an ice giant chased me into a corner and splattered me like a bug.  Forensic studies to this day will reveal half-elf bard blood in the cracks on the ceiling of the king room.  Everyone in the Vox raid died.  So did several innocent bystanders hunting in the zone.  <br>
Hoo rah, naked next to Jera!  <br>
I think she likes me.  <br>

1. &quot;Hmmm Which port was for Emerald Jungle and which one for Skyfire again?&quot; <br>
2. Something that happened yesterday: cast a targeted AE spell on a group of mobs thinking they're all off-tanked. Getting summoned by one of them, and savagely beaten before a tank can taunt it off. After that, the second wave of your own AE lands: Etelka has been slain by Etelka.<br>
3. Does miraculously saving the mob also count? Since a month or so, I have this purdy insta-evac-button: Exodus. One click and your entire group is *instantly* ported to a safe point in the zone. Last week my group was trying to kill a named mob, we had it down to 30 percent and all was going well. To gather some extra mana for the killing blow I wanted to cast Harvest. Harvest, for me, is hot-keyed under the &quot;7&quot;, Exodus is under the &quot;9&quot;. You get the idea. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.wxs.nl/~tom.van.der.veen/Sig-custom.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=660066><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub22.ezboard.com/brutabagaparadoxforum.showUserPublicProfile?gid=fyrahvalhallarose>FyrahValhallarose</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Found The Salad Bar! </span><br>  Posts: 19<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(7/30/03 9:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub22.ezboard.com/frutabagaparadoxforumstupidcharactertricks.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=98.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.eqjunkies.com/fyrahavatar.JPG WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Naked next to Jera</span><hr size=1> Hmm, reading those frantic lines of text, &quot;Evac, Evac, EVAC!!!&quot;; hitting your handy, dandy evac hotkey, which lets everyone know that salvation is a mere 10 seconds away, and to please be polite and not die; seeing that, by the grace of the gods, you got it off before anyone dropped; then the creeping horror sets in, as you zone back to your bind point, and you see that Gate was memmed rather than Lesser Evac; fully clothed next to Larren, while remainder of the group naked at various points throughout Norrath.<br>

Now though, playing my cleric, I find I have a nasty habit of either trying to stun my tank(s), heal the mob, or, in my worst display of moronic behvior yet, give the suckers a Symbol.

<br>
Was Pre-PoP and getting to some zones was a pain (even for a druid, at least inconvenient) so always had Egress loaded when soloing.  Forgot to switch to group Succor when heading into a dungeon in a group.

Snare FINALLY breaks, I take off down to the tower to zone into Skyshrine, praying I'm going to make it.  I get to the tower, drake in hot pursuit, I'm like &quot;woohoo, I'm home free&quot;, go flying up the stairs, and promptly out the window at the top.  Land squarely in the middle of the bulthar camp.
