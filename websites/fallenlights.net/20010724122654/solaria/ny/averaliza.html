<br><br>
Forests grew thick and silent in some areas of the world.
<br><br>
One area in particular, the forest seemed to be void of almost all light to a point where travelers had to carry a lantern to guide the way.  Though even that helping light seemed to be sucked and pulled away from the warm center of a thick candle to vanish into nothing in just a few feet.  Attached to a long five foot pole that swayed slightly with the motion of plodding horse's feet, the glow only saturated a few inches before where her feet went, guiding enough so that she saw the brambles and twisted roots that were there to catch her up.  They seemed to spring out of nowhere, as if living snakes that sensed the vibrations of her and the horse's steps drawing near to resting-places, and wrap around her ankles to stop her forward motion.  She learned, after many bruises to her knees, that she had to slow her pace from a quick, bold stride to that of a careful picking and choosing of where to place her feet.  Falling hurt, especially onto gnarled roots or pricking thorns over three inches long and it was always her poor knees that took the brunt of the damage, luckily the palms of her hands had yet to smack against anything dangerous.  She also figured out that gripping with a death's grip to the reins of the bridle, it would keep her from moving too fast or falling, only to stumble if she took a misstep.  The horse did not seem to mind the occasional jerk to the reins, causing its head to be yanked forward or done, for it meant that it was not alone in this dank place.  The smell made both their nostrils flare with deep intakes of breath, shivers running down her spine every few minutes and shaking her head to clear out the moldy taste that developed in the back of her throat.  Coughing was what the horse did once in a while, or snorting out puffs of hot air down the back of her neck.
<br><br>
Coughing out was exactly what the horse did suddenly; jerking its head up and dragging its walking partner backwards and away from a snarled root.  Either it saw the looping natural trap and forced itself to snap away, or it was pure coincidence that she was saved from a rather nasty fall.  Her eyes shifted away from the ground as she hung to the reins, trying to gain her feet again, and glanced upwards at her grey mount.  Again she wished that the silly horse would let her sit upon its back, but each time she attempted to swing up onto the saddle, it would sulk and twist itself back a few feet. Straightening herself finally as the horse just stood there gazing off into the darkness, she glanced out and around as well, sniffing the air some as she attempted to look passed the red haze of light.  Curling her fingers tightly into the leather reins, she tugged gently to start moving again, stepping over the nasty root and guiding the horse's feet as well.
<br><br>
She hated this forest.  With a passion she hated it, for she had been through it many times before, and once was in flight from death.  But all the other times save this one, she had magic to help push away the dreadful shadows, now it was just a flickering, dim little candle that forced the shadows to stay back.  They fought good and strong though, pushing the light into a tight circle, not letting her see what lay beyond.  It was as if the forest did not want to give away some secret it kept hidden off the path she walked---if she could call the root and bramble covered ground she walked upon a path.  Her lip was curled into a displeased snarl for most of the half-day's journey, eyes set in a stern glare to try and probe passed the boundaries of the red light, seeking some other natural source of day.  With white knuckled fingers from the grip that she had on the horse's reins, she continued forward, eyes flicking down to the edge of the light on the pine needle covered ground, following the path that was not really a path.  Though to one that knew this forest somewhat, there really was a path just not in the normal way.  There was no over-used wear and tear, the forest saw to keeping all sign of passing hidden, but there were signs of direction to travel.
<br><br>
Seeing that the needles were still lying eastwards, she lifted her golden gaze back to searching for nothing.  She removed one hand quickly from the reins to tug sharply at her fur trimmed cloak, drawing it over her shoulders tightly to block not the wind, but the pressure of a hidden gaze.  It was the sense that the horse had as well as she, of eyes that probed inwards towards them watching that they made no false step off of the route.  And this was growing stronger the closer she made her way to her destination, hand now dropping from the soft, warm fabric to the hard touch of a pummel wrapped with stiff leather, worn down to the shape of her slim fingers.  The sudden touch of her hand made the sheath tap softly against her thigh and stirred the metal clips that held it to her body, the noise startling the horse to give a loud snort in annoyance, eyes rolling to look towards her.  But, then it was back to looking at where it would set its feet, figuring that she was the one to break the silence.  Ignoring the beast of burden, she continued to search for something out there, knowing that if it wanted to be seen she would have been dead or caught in a trap by now.  No, what ever that searching and probing gaze was that had been following her traveling was only there to watch.
<br><br>
There were rumors about this forest in particular, more so than any other one on this half of the world, for its shadows were the deepest and least penetrable, and people got lost constantly after spending half a day within its depths.  Some rumors, like that of some how following a natural path was true; the one about the green slime that descended upon people that fell asleep under a certain type of tree was not.  The path she knew about, only because she had been shown the correct way of reading the needles that never blew around in the stiff wind that would appear from time to time, and so even her slow travel was a quick one, for she would not have to dally with searching out some man made walkway.  They lay with their tips to the east, slightly traveling south now, leading a city deep within the quiet forest.  Only those from that home knew how to find it again, a safety precaution and death would be swiftly given if ever a stranger happened to stumble upon the hidden land, even if it was by happenstance.  She figured that the watching was the Guard, following her trail and sending back reports that someone was on their way through.  There would be someone waiting for her, for another rumor was that of a hidden city, one that was quite true or she was lying to herself.  A heavily guarded city protected well against almost every element and creature and race.
<br><br>
To her, it was an old home, but one that would not welcome her with open arms and smiling faces.  She would be lucky if she came out of the forest and across the clearing with no wounds.  Unless the Guard's leader was in a benevolent temperament for the next few hours, or it was a new leader and generation that had forgotten about her.  But if that were the case, she would have been dead a long time ago, bristling with arrows like a porcupine.
<br><br>
At that thought she stopped and glanced off over her shoulder, expecting to see the streak of silver flying towards her body.  Instead, she saw what it was that had made her pause her train of thought, eyes widening just a bit out of surprise.  Light, a pure white sun's glow trickled and dappled over the ground, the color of green leaves hazily appearing just to her right.  And a breeze hit her lean figure then, causing her to step back against the horse for protection, eyes averting to the darkness before her and to the right.  Curious, for she thought that there was a while longer to walk, she dropped her yellow toned eyes to her feet.  Her head cocked to the side and she pursed her lips, fingers uncurling from the pummel of her weapon as she bent down and ran her hand over the needles.  Just to see if it was an illusion on her senses.  But no, the needles did not falter under her touch, just shifted naturally.  There was no wavering or bending of the light that illusions usually gave, that and the people that lived within the hidden city were deaf to the art of magic.
<br><br>
Sniffing the air, she glanced while crouched down off to the left again, and yes, there was some dancing light as wind caused branches to move shadow about.  The needles were suddenly pointing in that direction, she wondering how she had failed to notice the change.  But now it didn't matter, for there was the sunlight, the end of the path and the beginning of a field of grass.  Staying close to the ground, she leaned back, putting weight on her hands so that she could futilely scan the over head branches, fully knowing that there would be nothing but darkness up there.  Which was exactly the case.  Only at the end of the path did the forest break apart and let light fall and reveal that it was an actual forest, that end was off to the left.
<br><br>
She let out a sudden hiss of surprise, flinging herself forward under the pressure of a warm muzzle at her back, the horse whinnying softly and nudging her to keep going, hinting that there was no way it wanted to stay in this realm much longer then needed.  Swatting her hand harshly back against the side of her horse's head, she pushed her hands into the deep bed of needles and lurched to her feet, hesitantly taking a few steps off towards the light.  Warily she looked about, upwards towards the breaking a part shadows, searching the branches for signs of guards with arrows.  Nothing was there as her eyes passed along the branches, all but leaves and blue sky and some clouds.  Her bravery was seeping out into the ground as she continued to walk forward, boots plodding a little too loudly against the thick carpet, the horse sounding like ten.  And by the time she reached the last few tracings of needles, she was practically shaking with uptight nerves, eyes darting about quickly.  What she was looking for was not her death, but how she was going to be received by people who had exiled her over a decade earlier.
<br><br>
Drawing in a deep breath of crisp, fall air, the horse suddenly barreled its head up against the small of her back, forcing her to fully leave the dreadful forest behind.  The soles of her worn boots hit the hardness of a brick path, but she did not look down.  She could not.  Her eyes were fixed upon a blackened mass of dull rock, on towers that spun up towards the sky in the center of the mass, tips catching the sun and glowing with a golden hue.  A lone statue stood halfway down the black road, an angel with wings spread and hands aching to try and touch the clouds.  Head thrown back, neck exposed, the marble statue stood in a frozen moment of a scream of fright.  She knew that tears had even been carved trickling down its rounded cheeks.  She knew for that was the last thing she saw before being beaten into unconsciousness.
<br><br>
It was the marker of the dead race, the forgotten ones that lived within that stronghold of onyx and marble and granite.  It stood there from since she had been a child and probably long before then.  The sari carved it in the middle of a great war, leaving it to stand as a reminder of the ruining of an old bond.  The statue was of the first sarian citizen slain by the hand of their brothers.  An image of what it must have been like to feel a cold blade being run through the belly, of seeing whom it was that held the pummel.  She was of that enemy race, but to the sari, she was one of them, for the magic that had been outlawed and then swiftly bred out of the blood hide her true self in a lie.
<br><br>
Her eyes dropped from the silently screaming angel, looking back over her shoulder at the thick forest that did not seem as heavily foreboding as it had at the start of her walk that morning.  And it only took that one moment of her head being turned.  For in the next, the prick of a sharp blade was against her side, the grip of a strong hand upon her arm holding her from running.
