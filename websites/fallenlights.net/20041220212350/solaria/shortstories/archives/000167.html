<br>
<br>Something Will Always Survive<br>

<br>

<p><p>Something will always survive. </p></p>

<p><p>Perhaps that that's true, mayhaps it is the most blatantly false observation there is. But, it was hope. </p></p>

<p><p>Perhaps something would survive if its chemical's were imbalanced, strange enough that even the most horrid circumstance could not destroy it. Or maybe that something would change after that said circumstance, morphing. </p></p>

<p><p>The land was dry, hard and caked with cracks that ran across the surface like miniature canyons, stretching as far as the eye can see. A few reeds had sprung upand wilted, hardening into hollow shells that's only purpose was to create fingerlike projections upon the dry, mud-desert, crackling when ever a stiff wind would blowup. Mountains ran around that deadness, surrounding on all sides but the north, and that was where the wind came from. </p></p>

<p><p>There was nothing else. At least nothing that could be considered life. </p></p>

<p><p>Something always survives, never meant that it had to be living. </p></p>

<p><p>But this time, as the dead land lay under the broiling white sun, cursed without a cloud in the sky to give any sense of relief of rain, something had survived. Only in away that would fit the landscape, for that was all there was now. </p></p>

<p><p>Eyes of a dark, brooding tone scanned over the horizon, fixated only on that distance, for that was still unknown, different then what was nearby. The search continued westwards along the fuzzy, dusty horizon, following the faint line til it was broken apart by a sudden bursting of black granite from the earth. A festering wound that had rotted and hardened to rocklike textures. This line, jagged and peaking as if to try and burst what ever cloud would dare to come near the wasteland, continued around til the one with the glance had to turn round to see what was behind. </p></p>

<p><p>The view suddenly skewed as she tilted her head slightly, as if puzzled by this three quarter ring of rock. Darting her tongue out to catch between her dried, cracked lips, she made a soft noise akin to a snort of frustration, her mind not fully awakened yet to delve into such questions as the one she was posing. </p></p>

<p><p>So her gaze traveled onwards til it reached the point of starting. </p></p>

<p><p>She was the survivor. </p></p>

<p><p>A waif of a girl, wispy and as delicate as the dried out reeds that dotted the desert, bone structure built like that of a bit of lace. Her face had an alien quality to it, large eyes that shone with an eternal light, black like polished gems. A smallish nose that only swooped up slightly, barely even a nub between her eyes and mouth, which was only a line with a gentle tone of pink to make some lips. Her chin was rather pointed, adding to the guise that she's snap in half if a feather landed on her shoulder, and it was almost surprising that her hair, whiplike and writhing, curling around her slender body had not done just that. It was of a black color as well, darker then black if it was looked at for too long, serving as a way to make her pale skin ghostly translucent. Untouched by the sun in tone, yet there she was, standing days away from the nearest shade full out in the mid-day glare. </p></p>

<p><p>Her hand lifted up in a simple gesture to cover her eyes with shade to scan once more, searching to see if she had missed anything in the first go around. This time she didn't let her eyes wander up by the distracting mountains, but rather followed the foot hills around. </p></p>

<p><p>There could be more chance of life within those, for they had a less foreboding quality to their starkness. The horizon for those hills moved and shifted slightly, hinting that maybe the notion of life was true, though she knew that it was only the coming wind running through the grasses. </p></p>

<p><p>Not seeing anything other then the stiff snapping grass, she and her hair which covered her body modestly traveled off from where she had rested, following an imaginary path. </p></p>

<p><p>She kicked up dust as she half stumbled, half ran across the dead field of grass, a clear trail that she had been there. Tracks of feet running off towards the foothills to the north, where the large mountains had yet to ruin the land. Spindly legs carried her at an uncertain pace, jogging or strolling as she lost wind once in a while. </p></p>

<p><p>Her hair though, did not snap in the movement she made, not pulled back from her slender form to whip around behind her like a cloak. Rather it stayed clung to her body as if a babe not willing to release its mother for anything. it played at being clothing, strands slightly catching into the wind and pulling from her shape, but not to the extent in which normal hair should. </p></p>

<p><p>This run lasted for a quarter of the remainder of the day, leaving her winded and paler then before, if that had been possible. Her skin was gleamed over by a layer of sweat, though was gone within moments of her stopping to take in a few breaths of hair, sucked up by the over powering rays of the sun. The distance covered, she couldn't tell, for it was the same everywhere. Perhaps the distance between her and the safe foothills was less, but she couldn't be sure as she squinted in that direction. </p></p>

<p><p>Once again she took up her scouting, hand becoming a visor for her seeking gaze as it roamed over before her, then behind. It was as if she expected pursuit, or perhaps some change in the scenery that would make her wish to turn home. Nothing, so far seemed to deter her from her goal. <br /><br />
