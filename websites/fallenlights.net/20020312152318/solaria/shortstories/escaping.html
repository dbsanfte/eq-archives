Figures darted forward.  Shadows growing large along the walls, long and slender like the spiders they worshiped, giving chase.  They carried bows and swords of an obsidian metal as they ran along dark hallways.  Once in a while one would pause to fire an arrow before them, waiting to hear a noise.  Always there was silence to answer them, but they continued on.  Soon, their shadows died away from the walls, the interior lights from the vast cavern deeper in the ground leaving them alone in the dark.  Feet padded without a whisper.  Breath left their nostrils with control.  Nothing could give away their position to the one that they chased along.
<br><br>
There seemed to be a score or two of red eyes, burning brightly with anger and lust for the death of the one they followed.  Eyes that left a trail of red as if scorching the air they ran through.  They saw nearly perfectly in the pitch, thick underground land, reading minute traces of heat.   And those eyes moved along a fading trail of footprints that sprinted away before them.  Prints that had started out far apart when the prey was with a new breadth but were becoming less distant from footfall to footfall.  Becoming worn and used and tired.  With an exited murmur, the pack of hunters burst into a new dosing of speed, eager to end the chase.
<br><br>
* * *
<br><br>
She ran along a slick floor.  Glowing phosphorous moss gave her trek another danger; one that was then real to her run as she realized that she was headed dead on into the wall.  Unable to stop, she threw her arm foolishly out to halt her insane speeding.  There was a soft crack, wet and quick, and it sent a river of pain flooding down her arm, causing her to reel with a stunned stupor away from the wall to where the shadows danced like wraiths in a small nook, wrist hanging limp against her body.   Cradling it close, she drew in a soured breath of air, tasting the mildew on her dry tongue.  Almost.  Just a bit longer and they would give up.  An arrow thudded above her head, bouncing off the hard stone and dropping soundlessly to the ground at her feet.  Warning shoots.  With a worried glance over her shoulder, past the torn, bloodstained cloak, she watched the warm bodies of the hunters still flowing up the tunnel from deeper in the ground.  Almost there.  And she shoved herself away from the wall, wobbling as she started up again at her tired, yet quick run, managing to bolt around a corner just as a volley of arrows clattered off the stone face.
<br><br>
Angered voices hit her ears as she tumbled upwards, the ground becoming softer, dirt and moss under her feet instead of wet rock to slip up her running.  Quivering softly, she looked past the hem of her cowl again, seeing them near.  A whimper fled her parted lips and while clutching her arm tightly to her chest, she tore off up the steep slop.  She knew there was a light up ahead, or with luck, a soft glow of a moon.  Not that she'd ever seen a moon or a sun, she just heard the horror stories passed down from her Mother's lips to hers and her sisters.  Fear the surface.  Well, unfortunately for herself, she was fearing her life would be shortly ending if she didn't force herself forward, ducking now and again as volleys dashed by herself, some renting through her already tattered clothing.  So fearing something that would make her blind was of no consequence at the moment.
<br><br>
Almost there.  Almost, almost, almost.  She continued to think that with a steady pulse to go with the pounding of her feet upon the hard ground.  She hated them.  Hated the rituals to a demon thing.  And life in a light that would probably send her screaming for mercy was a hundred fold better then dwelling below ground.  The hate kept her running, sending a flood of energy along her strained, taunt muscles.  Life was not fair.  Neither down there or on the run, nor did she believe that anything would change above ground.  Save for the lack of dark powers that only survived in her chaotic world.  She knew that her hatred for her own blood would be one thing that would keep her alive long enough to see at least one sunrise without it sending her running away.  That was something that had never been heard of before.  No one from below had survived above ground once the sun lifted its massive, glowing self over the horizon.  That was what she looked forward to.
<br><br>
Behind her was a crumbling House.  Once it was great and glorious in times long past, shards of glass and stone piling up on now twisted, life-less bodies of her family, magic trickling out into the air to contaminate anything it touched upon.  She left behind chaos, the life force her peoples dwelt in and loved in and sacrificed in.  She gave them what they wanted in a way that was unheard of; she was the disgrace to the noble House that once stood with the eldest of creations.  And she left behind her past, wanting to start out like a mewling babe.
<br><br>
So she ran, as fast and hard as possible, broken wrist throbbing, making everything before her hazy, her steps faltering now and again.  Feet landing not inches from a patch of slick moss that would tease her into falling and perhaps breaking another bone.  Perhaps slowing her enough to have a dozen or so arrows coming like a deadly rain upon her body.
<br><br>
A scream of a mage behind her, hissing the words of a spell that would not be of effect upon her body; a skill that the mage had learned of and would most likely be making adjustments to what was spit out at her.  At least so she hoped.  There was the sound of slashes as swords were removed from sheaths.  An out right war against the single creature.  She was not that brave.  She ran onwards, boots digging into earth and deeper, drier moss to a soft glow flickering years and years before her.
<br><br>
The magic took effect, but not upon her as she first had thought.  It happened above and around.  The walls seemed to drip ichor upon her running body, large globules of melted rock hitting around her feet.  Tilting up her head, she saw the shifting stone, dripping like water, covering her with droplets that became heavier, changing back to stone when attaching its prey.  Quickly, she looked back to her destination, her good hand tugging the cowl over her hair and face even more to block any watery stone from making contact with her skin.  Whispering words left her lips, attempting to cast with the deadened hand that was as grey as the hardening stone upon her clothing.  It failed right as it passed her lips, making only a soft crackling as it fizzled away into naught.  Muttering obscenities from her sharp tongue, she darted off towards one of the walls to be out of the path of this falling ceiling, doubling her pace.  Her heart near bursting fire through her body, lungs screaming for her to stop.  Without looking back, having a feeling that they would give up soon--for they were not prepared for the light--she pushed forward, muscles straining to continue to work for her.
<br><br>
Almost there.
<br><br>
She continued to reassure herself, wanting to believe that she could escape from below.  Few did.  Few ever made it as far as she had.  Gulping down her fears, she pushed herself harder to move with the added weight on her cloak.  The walls at her side vanished as she began to see black, for blood rushing through her body, making it hard to see clearly.  It throbbed hard through her ears, deafening.
<br><br>
Then things began to go numb.  For a few moments it was a thankful relief to the torment she had felt for what seemed to have been years.
<br><br>
Her body was shivering as she beat her path quickly, lips parting to suck the air deep into her lungs.  She stumbled forward to send knees grazing against pilings of rocks, her unhurt hand dropping forward to keep her from collapsing.  Nothing behind seemed to give a whoop of success, for at the notion of the light and knowing she was not going to be stopping, they had pulled back, waiting at the fringes of the tunnel where the ground had yet to turn to earth.  Waiting like hungry lizardmounts just at the end of their chain, wanting to go further.  She waited, straining to hear through the rush of her blood in her head, gasping as she drew in the burning air into her retching body, shuddering, muscles taunt, bones near breaking at the tightness she forced her body to stay alive.  With blood drizzling from her kneecaps, she pushed herself back to her feet, tumbling forward a few more yards; her shoulder grazing against the wall's jagged face, yet also keeping her from toppling over in shear exhaustion.
<br><br>
A moment past.  One that was silent of all things save for her scuffling feet, breath now soft and tired, drawing in painful air that tasted funny, missing the taint of ore mixed in with the particles that she had grown used to in her centuries of existence.  With yellowing eyes from her discomfort and exhaustion, she froze in her tracks to stare at the mouth of a narrow, yet tall and craggy opening to the tunnel that was like a giant rip in the face of the mountain it had been cut into.  Then she turned her gaze to stare down at the ground, at the line that divided the darkness with a beam of brilliant light.  Just looking towards this whiteness she quaked, eyes tearing up at the force of brilliance.  She could not go on.  Harsh realization hit her at that moment.  There was no way that she would be able to live in such a world.  With a sob that racked her exhausted body, dropping her to the ground in a heap, she collapsed yet again.  Rolling to her back to keep her wrist from becoming more mashed up then it was, she just laid there with eyes staring back towards the darkness she had fled from.
<br><br>
Almost, but not quite there.
<br><br>
She could not go on and she refused to even attempt to move again.  Willing herself to stay awake to keep a lonely guard up against any possible attacks from below, or above.
<br><br>
***<br><br>
Time passed.  The light shifted across the floor, her eyes finally having slipped closed.  They had waited for just that moment, waiting for her to finally give in and sleep.  With a sharp gesture of fingers, three dark shadows slipped into the crack in the side of the mountain, arrows knocked and aimed for her chest.  The one that had motioned followed with a guarded slowness.  Chattering in a liquid tongue to each other, they carefully lowered their aim.  One dared to reach out and laid a soft hand upon the dark one's cheek.  With an annoyed gargle, the one following sharply motioned them away from her; their sight may disturb her.  Tugging his cloak around his broad shouldered self, the paler creature dropped to his knees to let his fingers carefully search over her neck for a pulse.  She stirred, eyes not opening, but gave him enough reason slid his arms under her back and knees, pulling her like a rag doll from the ground.  Again she shifted with a disjointed cracking of some stiffened bones.  Then her arm--the ruined one--dropped from resting on her stomach and hit against his side as he took a step forward.  A sobbed, choking cry passed her dried lips.
<br><br>
She slept in blackness riddled with a reminder of her suffering.  A bursting of torturous pain lanced continuously up to her shoulder causing her fingers to tighten, and thus sending yet another wave of fire up her arm.  It would not let her forget that she was ruined.  Tears streaked down her cheeks as she failed to wake herself, enduring the pain that she brought unto herself by flexing and un-flexing her fingers.  But, soon even that started to die away, being replaced by a gentle throb that settled into her nerves, blood pounding along the broken bone so that she would not forget that she had been rendered near useless.  At least in her mind.  Her lips parted as the pain continued to dance along her arm as if it was being broken over and over again.  A groan passed out with her breath and the one that had started to carry her out of the cave paused and glanced down with grey eyes, searching her wrinkled up face.  Upon registering that the creases were of stress and pain, he stopped completely and gave her a thorough look over.  As sensitive as her arm was now, somewhere in her mind clicked that movement had started and stopped and that that was the cause to the distress that wallowed in her near unconscious state.  Weakly her eyes opened and he caught the slight movement as well, sucking in his breath to await her reaction to his face.
<br><br>
And it came, as he had believed.  An ear-piercing scream, unearthly in pitch, like the wailing cry of a dying creature in the presence of its killer, slammed into his mind as well as hearing--his and everyone else’s.  She wanted to break their hearing, render them useless.  A few of the weaker ones dropped to their knees with hands at their ears, trying to block the sound.  Hands pressed hard against their skulls.  Trying desperately to block the loud scream.  He, thought, stood there stoically, defiantly blocking her attempt at getting into his mind, her attempt to have him drop her.  Even though that plummet would mean more suffering in the near future.  She apparently did not like being in his arms.  No, she abhorred being held like a precious, delicate creature, and so what if she was in need of medical attention.  She had run to get away from captors and had ended up being in the arms of another one.
<br><br>
Snake-like her body twisted and then bucked and rocked.  She lurched this way and that in attempt to free herself, but his arm muscles tensed into a steel-like grip and held her crushed against his chest.  Legs, long and slender, kicked to settle blows with her metal shod heels and her good arm--he had figured out the problem with the other, having seen the mashed up bone in her other arm—was being used as a cudgel against what ever body part she could connect to.  And her screaming did not die as she writhed about, frantic to free herself.  Her breath was never ending.  But then it ended, short and still, leaving a ringing in the air.  Words left her lips to replace the sudden silence, unknowable by her rescuers for they were of her native tongue.  Sounds, harsh and biting and matching the blows in ferocity that she dealt to him, ripped out of her throat.  More tears fell as she grew in strength, adrenaline pumping throughout her veins like a thick drug, the fear egging her abuse onwards.  She was a madwoman.  And yet despite all of her protests--or attempts of protesting--he continued to hold her tightly, straining to keep her from hitting the ground.  It was like trying to keep a fish in your grip.  He knew that soon her pounding fist would stop driving against his chest, that the heels of her dirt-covered boots would stop pinching at his side.  He knew that there was blood flowing down his side from the battering, fresh wounds stung harshly, warmth and a sent of salt.  It was her teeth that he was the most wary about, snapping as she spit curse after curse upon his head for not doing as she wished.  Her jaw looked well formed and strong, and he did not doubt that once she had a grip with those teeth it would be trouble to remove them.  And hopefully soon the rain of the last of her magic upon his mind barrier would come to a halt as well; that hurt the most, worse then any headache that he had had before in his life.  Like some wonder, she had actually been able to spit a spell out at him during the struggle, despite the loss of one hand.  It was like a hammer smashing against weakening glass.  Blow after blow after blow hailed down, though weakening noticeably.  As he held her he looked down upon her ebony face that was covered in a slime of sweat, wretched and bleeding and twisted with pure hate.  If she did not want to be near a surface elf, then why in all heavens was she up on the surface?  Teeth gritted and she finally quieted, power and strength dying in a last gusty attack.  Her well-toned leg lifted one last time, driving down upon her side with the spike of her heel, driving it past his thin tunic of drab green and into his soft flesh.  One last attack that sent him stumbling backwards.  She had a look of tired pride--his eyes having never left her face as he tried to regain his balance without loosing his hold on her body--that she had somehow beat him first.  The fight had been some sort of test, or just a last resort of a wild creature before realization that they were caught.
<br><br>
Snorting some to let her know that he would have been able to resist even more attacks like that, he glanced away from the angered, bristled woman.  Breathing hard, trying to clear his head from that quick moment of uncertainty that he might not have been able to defend much more.  But he could always pretend towards her, lying with his eyes.  And hopefully that would deter any other attacks.  "Water."
<br><br>
To her, it was a rumble of rocks in her ears when he spoke a questioned order.  She strained to hear what he had said, as if listening intently would allow her to understand the talk of the pale one.  The blunt word was memorized quickly as soon as she recognized what cold substance was being forced into her mouth, and once knowing the liquid, she opened her lips and gulped it in as fast as possible.  Choking on the last few swallows, she twisted against his arms before settling into a tired lounging.  Her arm was near to sending her back into unconsciousness though, after that struggle, burning and pounding pain wave after wave through her body.  And yet, even with all the anguish it caused her, she remained tongue-bitten, not wanting to show a sign of weakness to the pale things . . . 
<br><br>
She balked again as she realized that she was no longer drinking anything, but something was still near her face.  Fingers.  Soft ones that were testing out the feel of her skin as if she were a prized bedding pet up for auction.  Then there was nothing.  The touch having left as soon as the one holding her realized her annoyance.  But a sensation that she was being stared at made her glance upwards, then out at what seemed to be a sea of white faces, all intent on what she would do next.  Not giving them any show, she only used her good hand to manually lift her other arm back up to where it was resting on her belly where it lay limply with a swollen look to her flesh.  Then her eyes looked upwards, blurred by the slight irritation of light near by, but she could see who was holding her.  Holding her tight enough to where she was a second away from being crushed to death.
<br><br>
The grey eyes looked back down at her, having yet to leave her face to see anyone around him.  She felt sick with him staring at her as if she was his most recent prize.  "We're going back to the village, whether you like it or not, girl.  That arm is a wreak." His nose wrinkled up some as he spoke a few more commands to the others around him, all the while staring at her as if she were the first of her kind he'd ever witnessed.  He looked near dead with the white skin though her glance was probing enough to see veins pumping blood, proving her idea false.  If he was waiting for an answer, he was sadly mistaken.  Once having screamed as if it was her death cry, her voice box was shattered to where she could only utter soft grunts or whining of pain.  And he continued to speak to her, as if trying to teach her the language.  As if she were planning on staying for some time.  "There is food there, and water."
<br><br>
There was that word again, and she nodded dumbly for want of some more poured into her mouth.  Now in a numbed state of lucid temperament, she cast a begging look up at the red headed elf.  He gave her a soft snort at the look, chuckling some and muttering, "black little mink you are," and promptly pressed a canteen into her good hand.  She suckled at the mouth of the cloth bottle, careful to not let one bit get passed her lips, taking her time at filling herself back up.  "So I guess that that was a yes, then?"  More of that harsh sounding noise of laughter came from his direction, and she actually gave him a moment of dumb attention.  As if she had any choice in where he would be taking her, or that she even under stood one rumbled word that passed his lips.  She just played her part of being a stiff burden in his gripping arms, an annoyance that would find some way of making him uncomfortable in keeping her bound as she was.  Not that being carried was a bad thing, but being crushed to where breathing was beginning to hurt . . . 
<br><br>
"Dos orn tlu phlithus," she murmured out, eyes giving up on their attempt to scour his face into her memory.  She was going to hate him for this, and told him that as she hunkered down deeper into his arms, trying vainly to get him to loosen up the death's grip.
<br><br>
There was that laughter again, growling his voice at the end as he leaned his lips closer, working out a rough attempt at her language. "Xas, Jabbress."  He agreed to her words, even calling her a Mistress of all things.  "See?  Don't be fooled, I know what you're saying."  He continued in her harsh, snake like tongue easily, speaking so that only she heard the words right up against her ear.  Though the words were halted and had some spaces of silence as he thought out what to say, he knew her own language, where as she only knew what 'water' was in his common.  "So no planning my death unless you know draconian.  That's a tongue I have yet to learn."
<br><br>
She remained silent, glowering held back in annoyance that her edge of superiority slipped one notch downwards.  To herself she made a private reminder to learn the tongue of the ancient lizards.  The nameless elf merely gave her a look that spoke his words for her to remain silent, and she forced her angered eyes elsewhere. 
<br><br>
All around were trees, thick with leaves and mildew and mold.  Large, spongy molds made steps up the sides of the pines.  Shadows on the ground crisscrossed each other as the moon began to rise, the sun finally on the last moments of its blood red descent.  Noises carried out of the forest and into the clearing that circled around the entrance to the cave.  Low calls that chirped eerily in the dusk mixed by frantic wailing screams not unlike her scream from moments ago.  There was green grass and living things, enough to keep her busy with her eyes.
<br><br>
A rustle to her right caught her attention though, and she twisted in the elf's arms to see.  Small and light-footed, a shadow covered female broke from the forest as if fighting for her life in the arms of the branches.  But before the child sized woman could make three more steps her body was riddled with five arrows.   All it took was for her to blink her eyes before realizing that she had been made into target practice.
<br><br>
Growling out softly and wiggling back and forth, she freed herself from the grey eyed elf's arms.  Feet on the ground, she darted forward to drop at the woman's side.  With her good hand she ripped off the cowl, peering down into the face of another dark skinned elf.  Still breathing, but that only lasted for a few seconds. 
<br><br>
Silence filled the area, all the other elves that had fired froze with their eyes fixed on her.  With cool fingers, slim and tapered nails, she pressed down the eyelids of the now dead elf.  Her head slowly turned, eyes fixating upon the leader of the pack of elves.  But she did not say a word, merely looked blankly towards him.  Why had she lived?  It was perfectly clear that they had no love for her kind, and this unwarranted slaying proved that to her.
<br><br>
He only looked back at her with the same uncaring glaze in his crisp eyes as he had earlier after the small struggle.  Broad shoulders holding his long cloak to his body shrugged and he turned off into the woods.  She had a feeling that she would follow or die like this.  Unmercifully.
<br><br>
Life up here seemed to be just like it was at home.  If you did not belong or have some skills, you were no better then a sheath for a sword or a target for arrows.
