<br>Caroleena Du'Shae - Eyes Opening<br>

<div align=justify>
<p>"What makes you tick?" Voice filtered past her ears again, she answered dutifully.</p>

<p>"My heart, the blood." </p>

<p>"Good, girlie" A hand stroke over a pale cheek, one that moved up to brush at her millions of tiny braids, pushing it back to keep on stroking at her cheek.  "Do you know what life is?" Blank look was given to the man before her, her eyes blue eyes icing over with faint annoyance as he continued to question her.</p>

<p>"No." She replied, a malicious tone egging off her lilting, irish tainted voice, a soft grin like that given to one's prey played off the corners of her lips.  "What is life?" She asked him instead, the one that kept most of himself to the shadows, wishing to not be seen.</p>

<p>His soft alto voice purring past her ears again. "One does not need true life, to live."</p>

<p>She sat at the edge of a bed, her boots shiny as they swung under her, kicking at the bedspread, her long, many layered gauze of skirts fanned out over the bed, dripping to the floor, billowing and folding as she swung her legs about like a child.  Her pale, oval face was upturned as if awaiting a kiss, lips, pale lips parted as she drew in breath, eyes watching his mouth as he spoke, watching that the air only passed when he needed to utter sound past his vocal cords.  "So your life is of others?" She finally murmured out, entranced by his shadowy form that hovered over her, hovering as Death would at the side of someone's deathbed, waiting to cut the life's string.</p>

<p>"Exactly." He stroked at her cheek, smiling in the darkness at his pet who was so willing to give up her blood and life. "Exactly, my dearest girl."</p>

<p>"This is what you want?" Simple question, a yes or no answer, her eyes turned towards him, staring at his face through the darkness.  <i>Yes or no?  Hrm?</i> Her thoughts flooded her mind.  <i>Either die now or in fifty years.  Or die and look like this for ages to come?</i> Vain and loving her self image, her fingers twisted into his hand at his side and gave him an innocent look.  One that always sent him crazy, the corners of her lips still hovering on that half smile. "Yes."</p>

<p>"And you're sure of this?" He wanted her to be his, but willingly, things were easier that way.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Very well then." His stroking hand started pushing aside her braids from her shoulders, the grin returning to his lips.</p>

<p>She knew of the way to behave, having already offered herself to him numerous times, her neck bared as her chin tilted upwards, the perfect movie scene.  A pale beauty and a man covered in shadows bending in to press his lips to her neck, canines elongating and gently sliding into her skin as he bit down, drawing in the warmth, pulsing into his mouth.  She shivered in pleasure, staying still for him, his arm coming around her to hold her tight to his chest as he continued to drink, his arm tightening as he went beyond a simple drink.  Her eyes opened <br />
up, straining ice blue as she realized what was going on, as if another consciousness had taken hold, but all was too late.</p>

<p>Blackness settled in.</p>

<p>A moment passed.  Two, three, four.  Hours and a day even traveled by as she lay in the folds of a thick bedspread, poised as if in the movies yet again, hands crossed over her chest as if a mummy, lips parted ever so slightly as if indicating she still breathed some life.  The shadow man was no longer in the room, but something else was.  Her eyes opened, tongue parched but still ran over dried lips, a rasping gag bursting from unused lungs, exhaling stale breath that had laid in her chest for that long while.  Hunger was apparent.</p>

<p>Panic.  A screech of a noise that flooded into her ears, a soft screech that might not have been heard by any other.  Icy eyes traveling near blindly over the darkened room, fixating upon a curled up form, a plump thing, pumping with goodness.  She wanted that.  Driving from her mind, she lunged forward off the bed, a strange movement from just laying there to practically flying through the air, hands extended, fingers flexed like claws.  Soft flesh, soft to the touch and playing with, she crouching next to the round form of the child.  A young, young child.  Fingers just dug deep, a grin playing at her taunt lips as the sound of pain flooded into her consciousness, her hand slapping over the ruddy cheek to silence the girl. "Behave." Was croaked out, her movements fast and ugly, tearing off a hand first, twisting the wrist's bone 'til it was supple and tender, sucking up the juices that flowed down her own arms, covering her in spilt blood.</p>

<p>The scream egged her onwards, seeking for more noises to bubble from the wretched child's throat, she working on the lesser important parts of her body.  Tickling her fingers -- bloody, sticky digits -- over the bottom of the girl's foot, a strangely pained giggle erupted from the dying meal.  The frantic woman with braids flying at her quick movements, laughed out delightfully, lapping up more of the liquids as they spilled, not really caring if she missed most of it.  She wanted the child to have the pain, her left hand now flying off her body as if she <br />
were a simple rag doll, then a gouge being slashed into her rounded belly.</p>

<p>She didn't notice the sudden quiet, the child having bleed to death, the woman busy with digging out the small heart, throwing it over her shoulder to land with a pretty little plop in the middle of the bed, a present for the shadowy man.  From this opening, her tongue darted in, wiggling about to gather up the last of the fluids, giggling happily as she feed, hunger still driving her deeper into insanity.  She wanted more.  And she knew, eyes and head shifting to look towards the entrance way to the room, the shadow covered man and a well formed male standing there, watching.  The man -- the one tight in the shadow's grasp -- looked as if his stomach had been recently emptied.</p>

<p>"MINE!" She howled out, bounding across the room to collect this paled man.<br />
