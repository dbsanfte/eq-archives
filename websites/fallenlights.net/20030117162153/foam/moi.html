Foam is a place for Zebraseal's writing (and occasionally other art). The version 9.0 lived for very short a time, because I was never really satisfied with it. While this version doesn't really take me to the verge of euphoria, either, it's still much closer to what I'd like to think of as me expressing myself.<BR><BR>The background picture (<a href="medusa.html" onClick="window.open( 'medusa.html','','height=534,width=375,menubar=no,toolbar=no,location=no,scrollbars=auto') ; return false">see</a> unmodified.
