<p>There are graves out there on the hill. See them?</p>

<p>Down there, where the latern stands proudly with a brillant yellow beacon streaming up between branches of pinetrees.</p>

<p>Down there, in a circle around the one latern that's job is to illuminate the walk home.</p>

<p>It had been an eerie enough of a day. No sun to cast shadows. A wintery breeze mixing through a sticky warm, almost still day. One of those days where you walk along, looking up towards the forest covered hill, wondering why you were trying to remember something. A fleeting thought, your mind grasping out but flaying wildly before even coming close.</p>

<p>One of those days where you don't notice the graves till after the sky goes dark.</p>

<p>One of those days always starts with a dream just before you awaken. Like the memories, it slips into nothingness just as you try to remember. It leaves you with a strange feeling churning within you.</p>

<p>Why didn't you notice the graves until the slight mist drew in as cool air filled the valley? It was the crow that had drawn the eye in that direction, looking out over the muddy landscape, the drifting hills that had been covered with snow, only to faulter in step and stare at the graves in the cirle surrounding the one latern.</p>

<p>It had been a bawdy crow, screaming like it had owned the sky. King of them all! he wailed as he flapped noisily through the otherwise dead sky.</p>

<p>It had dipped away before landing near one of the piles of snow, your eyes moving from that to the next to the next to the next. Every where else the snow was gone, sifted in with dirt after the long, murky day.</p>

<p>You stand there silently for a moment or so, wondering if they had been created for something? Were they something else? And with the shiver, you decide it is best to continue down the path, eyes looking every where else.</p>

<p>Until you reach the bottom of the hill, about to turn away and head elsewhere. You look back, people always look back.</p>

<p>And there they were. Graves on the hill.</p>
