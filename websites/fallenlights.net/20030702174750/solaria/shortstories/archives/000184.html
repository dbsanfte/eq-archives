<div align=justify>
<p>Heavy skirted. A hood drawn forward so that eyes were unseen...(unseeing?). Flesh of blue veins rushing under was exposed from tip of nose down to the indent of the belly. Exposed with bits of pink where the swells came to a summit.</p>

<p>Hands modestly held the thick, course robe to the rest, hiding more in shadows.</p>

<p><I>I wager.</i></p>

<p>Silence echoed past the rusty lips and the chin tilted ever so gently to the left.  The shadows swept the area of the forest, looking to one man to the next as they stared at the body.  At the <i>body</i> that revealed much in such a chilled atmosphere.</p>

<p>None dared to move, oh so entranced with need. Lust.  Desire for flesh to crawl and mix with their own in obscene ways in the dirt.</p>

<p>But the words had stirred their attention, even though none would swear she had uttered them.</p>

<p>One pair of eyes traveled down the lenght of her hourglassed body and fixed below the dent of a bellybutton, staring, hoping to see her sex fully.</p>

<p><I>I <b>wager</b>.</i> The cloak was snapped shut, blocking, protecting her from unclean stares.  <i>Shant anyone wager...</i> "I want a game." Her lips crackled open and a tongue danced out the words, noting that their minds were too feeble to be able to approach her in <i>her</i> ways of speech.</p>

<p>"I shall."</p>

<p>Asp of speech replied, the chin dipping to glance against the flesh between prominant collarbones, only to righten. "Shall?  Without... knowledge?"</p>

<p>The shadows moved as she <i>saw</i>.</p>

<p>"Knowledge? A game is a game, wench."</p>

<p>"<I>Whenchisca.</i>" Came a stern repremand, demanding the proper title if they were to call her more then just woman. "Second Daughter. And you have your wager promised then."</p>

<p>Brute that had opened trap to spew out spittle filled words gained to his feet, swaying in place.  Tispy.  (That, after all, had been what drove her to their fire in the open.)  Full lips of rusty tone pursed and tightened into a grim smile, one hand moving from clasping her robe to slide out, palm upwards.</p>

<p>The man shook some, wishing to sit, but knowing that he <i>could not</i> do as wanted.</p>

<p>Second... daughter? Sister of..? The rumors flew between the ones that were wise enough to keep their tongues within their mouth, only running it wetly along the backs of their teeth at the sight of such <i>vol</i>upious flesh.  The five men shifting on their logs seats to sit hard on their hands, not wishing to gain any attentions from lusty strokes her appearance was wanting them to start.</p>

<p>Second daughter. Her lips curved high, skin wrinkling at the movement.  And her other hand dropped, freeing the robe to curl about her mounds of flesh, letting at least the sitting ones enjoy the game.</p>

<p>"So.. what is your wager to keep your soul?" she whispered out softly between her smiling lips, taking a step forward, hand still palm up, waiting for his bet to be placed.</p>

<p>His head snapped, crackling of bone and sinew, roll of shoulders as he got a second wind of courage in his nerves.  "No.  What will the game be, Daughter?"</p>

<p>"<i>Averaliza</i> of course.  What else do I play?" Purring, her feet dug through the snow, pulling herself closer.  (One man lifted his hand and rung it across his chin, drawing away spittle from a loosing of drool.)</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>Rustling became active. Snap of the fire. A hand pulled down and yanked her robe tight about her body, tying it in place as her other hand withdrew small square wooden chips from a pouch.</p>

<p>She bent then, bowing to the man who was foolish to barter himself away to her before knowing the stakes. <i>I never loose</i> she whispered to the air to the men to the moon to the bowl that she then let the chips fall into it's care.</p>

<p>Bowl then in hand, she straightened and took the final steps foward, passing it to him. "Blank, you draw.  Dead you shall be. Come."</p>

<p>Back she went, black robe sucking at the pure white ground as she retreated suddenly from the light of the fire, to dice in private.  He followed after, drifting like a wraith, soul leashed to her <i>wants</i>.</p>

<p>Others were forgotten.  Others drove themselves insane, groaning out (Loud. <i>Moan</i>s) as their pleasures were now their own to give to themselves.</p>

<p>In silence, as she drifted along, she smiled.  Now that her hands were free of the luck game, she rid herself of the confining robe.  Stripping, skin from the body of a serpant, she let the black, harsh folds drift to the ground.  It pulled it off, the earth, taking it from her pale flesh lined with blue veins.</p>

<p>The man could do naught but gape and cry for being trapped with the game, unable to relieve himself from the desires she put into his body.</p>

<p>Pale legs, ripe.  The slight whisp of hair as she walked showing between.</p>

<p>Upon her head was a crown of black strands, winding in upon one another to form a nest.</p>

<p>She turned then and his eyes dropped to between her legs, gazing upon the sex and curls of dark hair she now allowed him to see, then upwards, to sweap along the swells of woman form.  Along the soft, oh so precious skin of a god<i>ess</i>.</p>

<p><I>...and screamed.</I>Rawfleshofthroat... became rubbed with harsh breathing as he was fixated with more of her flesh.  How did one see?</p>

<p>"As all <I>Whenchisca.</i>" she smiled, rubbing her fingers over the hallowed out eyesockets, plucking rotted flesh away to reveal only darkness. "You still wish for me? <i>Want</i>?"</p>

<p>Nod.</p>

<p>He did not speak.  She was not allowing him to work his mouth other then to throw forth his failure at wisdom.  He had not asked how she saw, she only knew that look in one's eyes of a mortal.  She saw.  Oh, she saw. and her fingers smoothed rotten flesh back over the bared sockets, prefering to keep the darkness within her.</p>

<p>"The bowl."</p>

<p>It was dropped, righted by her hand as she bent.  The bits of wood were gently (caressed) placed back into the holdings and she gave it a single stir of her fingers. "Wish as you want.  Blank and you die."</p>

<p>He wished.  He wished, but hope failed.  Sucked into her.</p>

<p>Wisdom.  That would have been what he needed to save himself.  But having failed the first test, the Second Daughter (lust, she was) had him the moment he had realized there was a woman within the camp.</p>

<p>His fingers, as she offered the bowl for him to draw, brushed across the wooden chips.  Watching the images that swam along the surface, but without what he so desperately needed...</p>

<p>Drawing of a breath, he closed his eyes (useless eyes that saw all that was not there.) and drew.</p>
