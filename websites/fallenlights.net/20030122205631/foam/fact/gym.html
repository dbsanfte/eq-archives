I can't imagine feeling encouraged to exercise by over-perky, light pop music. The only music suitable for listening to when working out is rock music that contains a little aggression or at least expresses an big ego, performed by tough people in top form. Iggy Pop and Metallica make excellent workout music. Bruce Dickinson is also good, but not Iron Maiden, anyhow, because they're not serious enough. Patti Smith isn't very muscular but she's so tough that she'll do well.<BR><BR><br>        <br><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></font></p> <BLOCKQUOTE><font FACE=Verdana,Arial,Sans-Serif size="2" STYLE="font-size:10 px" COLOR=black>| <a href=# onClick="window.close();">close window</a> |            </font></p> </BLOCKQUOTE></td></tr></table></body></HTML>
