I live in a nice little apartment, which I share with <a href="http://www.geocities.com/joanlux" target="_blank">Aino</a> and I can just barely afford it.<br><br>I sometimes see visions when I listen to music without vocals. One day, I want to see a real spaceship, one that can take you to another planet and another civilisation. Anywhere is better than here (Helsinki, Finland), but after I've been anywhere else, here is better than there.<br><br>I have no realistic idea of what to do with my life. I'm a little bit interested in everything (biology; mathematics; journalism; creative writing; playing the clarinet; making pop music; web designing) but not interested enough of anything.<br><br><a href="whatilike.html">Music, books, etc.</a></font></p></TD></TR></TABLE></center></BODY></HTML>
