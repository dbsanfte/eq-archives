<p>Yawning, Auno stretched. He reached back with his gracefully long hands and scratched a bothersome itch on his neck before it had the chance to spread all around and annoy him. Looking down at the ground with his white eyes glittering sleepily, he marked what had made the air so cold. Damning his magic that made him feel nothing touching him, though earlier the spell had seemed like a decent idea, he dug himself out of the foot deep pile of snow. There was a little disturbing tickle in the back of him mind, reminding him that snow this far south of the mountains should not have been due for at least another two or three months. Damn those elves, he thought. It was because of those twittering fools who thought themselves equal to the power of nature that this weather was screwed around too many times. Summer had been to damnably hot, and now this mess of cold wetness clotted into his clothes. And most likely in the next few days, it would be as blazingly intolerable again.</p>

<p>He hated frozen shirts and pants. Knowing that the river he had been sleeping next to was now frozen over, he dragged his fingers through the snow and scooped up a ball to suck on. Something behind him crunched through the snow.</p>

<p>"Still an animal, I see," came a rasping voice from the bushes, the feeling of eyes boring into the base of his neck. "I thought I had trained you better, Auno in'iska."</p>

<p>"Rennin," he growled deep in his throat, his hand unconsciously smashing his breakfast drink into small chunks. He pretended that the white snow was her bones, and he smiled slightly, lightening his mood somewhat. He ignored her insult, hating it when she reminded him of his mixed blood, something that was quite sneered upon with the two races he was breed out of. "What do you want?"</p>

<p>Branches parted on their own, pushed by magical wind and formed an arching entrance for the Sorceress's little sister to glide through. Her black boots barely touched the frozen ground. But, before she reached his side, she dropped to the ground heavily and frowned, her yellow wolf-like eyes raising accusingly to him. "I never tau-"</p>

<p>"Save it," he snapped out with a flick of his hand threateningly. "I'm not your slave anymore to bicker at. Or have you forgotten?"</p>

<p>Her painted red lips parted slightly, and she reached up to brush at loose silver strands from her high arched, elven face. Her cheeks, normally the cold shade of frozen white, was tainted pink from the cold. He smiled again at this, knowing that she lacked most of what he had been gaining over the passed months from those he drew power from. "I don't think that I'll ever forget, not even in death." She frowned at her memory of his breaking of her bonds, even when she had thought she had more power than he. "You know of Sister's Vendadra? Yes, you would, wouldn't you, after what they did to you . . . Anyway, she's bonded more Jangols to her, a Prince from Davenport, and a little boy. . . . Who I think will die shortly."</p>

<p>"Their names?" He eyed her warily. She did not know about the one who escaped? He mused to himself, trying to think of how to use his knowledge against the Three Sisters. "Maybe I've met them?"</p>

<p>"I think not," she muttered, her eyes still looking him over guardedly. "Jene and Lao. The first, the poor Princeling, lost his new bride a few weeks ago, just before my sister had found him. Though a good thing the girl had died, instead of living with an untrained Jangol, she would have had trouble breaking him. Sister took him in. I've seen him just moments ago, he belongs to her now. Not that you would fully understand since you broke with me before fully mine, you would have enjoyed it. I never seemed to be able to harness your darker magics, lovely boy." A dark smile lifted a corner of her thin mouth. She looked up at Auno with a mocking cast to her face. He was more relaxed then she, though how he could soaked to the bone and keep still without even a shivering? His hard angled face hinted at elven blood, but with a brutish look of facial hair, his other half from the humans forced its way out. The tips of his ears were pointed, but not as much as a full bloods would have been, and he kept them hidden constantly under his gold hair. It caused less trouble to appear human then a half-breed. Leaning closer in, too close for his liking, but he protested not, she ran her hand across his woolen vest and slipped her fingers under the thick winter cloth, scratching his disturbingly dry, smooth skin lightly with the tips of her nails. Angrily, she realized that he had 'eaten' some Wizard's power and gained his talents. Forcing a thick, sultry voice out of her throat, she muttered, "You were always my favorite. You don't want to come back? It's much better than living out here in the weather. Or do you live some place warm on other nights? In a bed?"</p>

<p>"Funny, Rennin. I know you better than you think, so stop trying to annoy me." He caught her chin in his grasp and lifted it to his face, until she was a colorless blur as if he was thinking of pasting a kiss against her dark lips. "Why did you come? And alone. You know I'm stronger and could easily take your energy."</p>

<p>"But, would you dare?"</p>

<p>"Depends on if I'm hungry enough." He paused and pulled out her roaming fingers before she went too far and actually accomplish some teases, holding them firmly in his larger hand to keep them away. She bothered him more then the annoying elves and their playing with the weather. "Why are you here?"</p>

<p>"I need your help, Auno," she muttered. Batting her lashes, she slipped her hand away from her side and raised it to his taunt, clenched jaw. "Will you help me?"</p>

<p>"With what?" he rasped gruffly, suddenly less bothered by her peskiness and more annoyed at the way she tried to lure him back into her powers.</p>

<p>"Jene is just a boy, not ready to be able to do what I had asked him to do-"</p>

<p>"So he's yours as well?" He watched her face darken slightly. It was not uncommon for the three witch sisters to share their brood of pets, though he was the special one for Rennin and luckily did not have to suffer with bouncing from bed to bed every night between the elves. Sighing, he asked, "What do you need help with?"</p>

<p>She watched him steadily as her other hand glided over his ear, tracing the outline of the shape. Suddenly, she pinched the tip, making him hold in a growl of pain and he turned a bit to make a snap for her fingers with his teeth, missing as she jerked backwards. Elfish ears, whether Jangol or not, were sensitive to the touch, and anything with pressure behind it caused un-pleasurable discomfort. "He's going to look for the sarian Wizardress and keep her at bay until I find that Star of Auras'sie, but I don't think he'd be able to keep the Wizardress occupied someplace else. Can you?"</p>

<p>"Are you sure a sari?" he asked, doubtful she had meant a sari, then to just rile her blood to a nice boil, his voice changed to one of a teacher lecturing. "I've never heard of a full-blood sari having the ability of magic, let alone be strongly willed enough to tackle the training to become a Wizardress. Besides, saris hate the elves. So do I."</p>

<p>"So then she is an elf, hmm?" she thought out loud. "This might become interesting. She lives in No Samatory, or at least did for some time. In fact, she's just returned from a ten year exile."</p>

<p>"Done some homework? You're looking dangerous, Rennin. What is it that you need help with? Surely it's more then just dealing with the girl," he growled. She looked up at him with a thin, hopeful smile. "And don't think that I'll become yours again."</p>

<p>"Come with me to No Samatory, Auno Talle. My Sister's boy won't be a problem, nor my power-hungry Sister. We have to find that Staff Dabane's been musing about for centuries." Her eyes glittered as if she was staring into the depths of the crystal at that moment.</p>

<p>"What if I say no?" he ventured for conversation.</p>

<p>"You, my dearest Auno," she hissed. "Have no say in this matter."</p>

<p>He jerked his head up a bit from staring at the frozen water from some time, lips pulling into a sneer. Baring his teeth like a feral animal, he pushed himself to his feet in order to look down at the short elf, needing to have a bit of a feeling of over-riding power at the moment. With a voice that hinted upon her strangulation, he whispered down to her, "didn't I just say that you had no control over me? And here you are, telling me that my participation is ordered."</p>

<p>"And here you are sleeping out in the freezing cold."</p>

<p>"That doesn't matter at the moment, Rennin, what does is the fact that you don't own me any longer and need to get that out of your head."</p>

<p>"Apparently you didn't understand what I had meant," she snapped back with a flick of her hand up towards his towering form. "Even if you said yes, you'd never have say with what is to be the plan with what I am attempting to do."</p>

<p>"Then why not just say that from the start, instead of trying to rile me up? It's as if you were trying to be the Jangol and not I."</p>

<p>Laughing softly under her breath, she stretched her arms out eyes glittering with an intensity that sent a few shivers down his back. Calmly she tugged at the folds of her dress to pull the hem of her dress up out of the layering of snow on the ground, then finally looking off towards some far off point on the horizon, she answered him. "And by me getting you riled up saves me from you feeding off of my emotions. Remember who taught who here." Pausing to let that little bit of insult to pile up to her name calling from moments ago, she gave him a grin that matched the greed in her eyes. "Now. Are you going to help me or bicker about if I still want you as a pet?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'd love to just continue a nice spat with you." His white eyes rolled in their sockets, voice a sarcastic tone. And since she had brought up the fact about feeding, he was starting to feel a bit hungry. So why not just try and egg her on a bit more, just to see if he could possible get some dinner before being tricked into working for the witch sister. Though she'd know if he tried to do anything to her, no matter how subtle of a move, for she had been right. She did train him in the art of being what he was. "Or do you really have to go to that sari town this minute?"</p>

<p>"I'm giving them a day to sit around and for Mialyn to stir up some trouble, then send in a Shifter."</p>

<p>"One of those?" he snarled softly, suddenly not wanting to have anything to do with this plan of hers any longer. Those creatures drove him to near insanity with their lunacy and mindless programmed way of getting the job done. "Why am I needed if you're sending a Shifter to take care of things?"</p>

<p>"If you wish to take care of a Wizardress all by your lonesome, then tell me now before I waste Crenger's time in getting one made."</p>

<p>"Why couldn't you have told me before I started thinking that this plan might actually work. You know that those monsters drive me up the wall, and yet here you are babbling away and throwing one in just at the last moment." He cut her words off with a swipe of his hand in a pulled hit for her face, just to shut her mouth before she interrupted. "I'll still go, Renning. But, here me now. If that Shifter botches up one thing, I'm curtailing it back to some unknown corner of the world where you'll never be able to find me again. Got it?"</p>

<p>Tilting up her chin, the elf looked as if she was about to send a wad of spittle into his eyes. "Of course, dear."</p>

<p>He strongly resisted the urge to bring his hand back down to contact flesh to flesh; the witch needed a good slapping at this moment, her haughtiness egging on his foul temper. Instead he lifted his hand to run through his mane of hair, pushing it back to catch behind the slightly pointed ears of his half-breed elven blood. Once more he was reminded just why he had broken himself free of her magic lacing, quite glad that this woman was not pulling the strings any longer. Bluntly, she was just an old spoiled brat with the power to get her almost all of what she desired, and she was youngest of the three witches and the least experience. But he had one hell of a time trying to change around the idea of who ran whose life. Giving her one of his annoying blank stares, one that got the reaction he hoped for-a soft snarling growl from the back of her throat, quite an unlady-like noise if he could say so-he finally broke his momentary lapse from speaking. "Then why exactly am I needed?"</p>

<p>"I'll let you know when the time comes." She eyed him again, relaxing herself from making dodges away from his threatening swats to her delicate cheek.</p>

<p>"You don't know, do you?" he chuckled, a smirk playing at the corners of his thin, pale lips and even his white eyes like that of a blind man glinted of some slight humor at her ill planning.</p>

<p>"I told you already, Auno. Did you forget so soon?"</p>

<p>"The talk wavered away from the original intent, so yes."</p>

<p>"Just occupy that bitch from creating too much trouble before my other plans with her get started. And no, I won't tell you of what I'm thinking about, so don't bother."</p>

<p>His smirk grew just a bit wider. "You don't know." </p>
