<p>Silver eyes scanned the jagged horizon that lay all around her view of the world, nose wrinkling as she sniffed at the acidic yellow air yet again, possibly the third or forth time where she forced herself to take in a burning gulp to her lungs.   It was an odd feeling -- an internal one, not the fire sensation from the fiery air -- one was waking up in the middle of nowhere, and now there was something different about herself that she couldn't place yet, but by all powers above she <i>will</i>  figure it out.  Unknowing of what she looked like at this moment -- it didn't seem to relevant at the time seeing that there wasn't a mirror in the field for her scrutinizing glare -- the molted red, black, and brown tabby kitten padded her way through the sheep-grazed, dry grass; once in a while she wove around a random birch here and there.  Darting forward with agile speed, she bounded onto a log that was set out to rot in the middle of the field, tail twitching nervously as she slowed, eyes again scanning over the now smokey looking horizon.<br />
<br><BR>Something was burning, but she new that already from breathing.  That acidic taste to the air, scalding her delicate, pink tongue was enough to make her whimper and spit out saliva from her mouth.  Sitting on her haunches, the kitten looked pissed for some reason.  A slightly over sized paw lifted to her gnawed-up, scarred ear and batted the itch away, her eyes never once leaving the horizon, a puzzled look -- replacing the one of annoyance -- appeared on her too cute kittenish face as she reasoned out exactly what town it could be.  And sure enough, it had to be home, all the pieces she left behind fell together and completed the puzzle.  She blinked once at this sudden thought and shook her head quickly, grumping softly as  thoughts went from chaotic to pure sadness.  Tail swapped softly behind her in an erratic pattern, blinking yet again as she gave up attempting to find a quick way back home to stop what she started. <br />
<br><BR><i>Blasted witch hunters.</i>  That was her foremost thought at the moment. <i>So, she was a cat. . . that talked, nothing was stranger then a dog talking, why weren't they some form of creation of a witch?  But, no . . . only cats got the blame.  Bah, </i>she grumbled in her thoughts, <i>that'll teach them.</i><br />
<br><BR>Flames could be seen now, flickering yellow and orange lights that greedily feed on the city, eating out houses as if they were dried up bits of paper and not concrete.  So she accidently, while escaping the nets of the priest people, slammed into a candle.  It was their fault for not noticing this on their way out, and apparently no one noted until she was long gone into the woods.  So fires spread and she took off into the woods, only to rest here and watch the destruction.  Just a simple cat.  That's all she was.  Her thoughts kept going back to the cries of <i>"witch, witch! Burn it!"</i> She let out a shudder, sending a few dust motes flying from her molted fur.  Wasn't her fault that those priestly people saw her when shifting into kitten form.  <br />
<br><BR>Wait.<br />
<br><BR>She blinked and glanced down at her kittenish shape and let out a soft peep, which slowly grew into a wailing cry.  She had shifted too quickly and was a <i>KITTEN</i> of all things.  No sleek body and rippling muscles.  She was cute and fuzzy and fun to throw stones at.  At least she was able to hide, and was glad that her shifting had shaped her into a molted cat that her human hair suggested.  Need to be careful.  Now she had to deal with getting cuddles and pettings. <br />
<br><BR>And warm milk.<br />
<br><BR>A low purr ran from her lips as she sat there, watching everything burn.  <br />
<br><BR>"Bother." She purred out after a moment of being lost in thought about warm, warm milk in her belly, and bounded from the rotting log and into the dried grass, darting her way down the side of the road again, round rump and tail swishing as she lopped along.  Being all cute.<br />
<br><BR>She <i>hated</i> being cute.<br />
<br><BR>Damn her stubborn pride.  She continued to curse at her lazy self as she darted along quickly, trying to put as much land between her tail and the acid air of the burning fires.  Maybe being a kitten wouldn't be as bad as she thought -- even though short legs at this moment were not being a help -- since she was going to a newer land.  Or so she hoped.  Who knew how much that witch burning craze had spread between the villages?  Rumors spread faster then the wildest fires, especially those spurred on with threats of children being handed over to the evil one.  Like, for one sad story, herself. <br />
<br><BR>If cats could roll their eyes, she did at that sudden thought.  It was a typical reaction for most townees; the scape-goat syndrom, normal people had no reason to attempt the wicked art of magic, but girls with tri-colored hair and pale, sun-less skin were looked upon as the trouble makers.<br />
<br><BR><i>Cold, cold, cold, </i>she started chanting in her mind in time to the soft <i>thumps</i> of her feet on the ground, quickly ending her last run of thoughts on the past.  She topped a rise in the field and paused to glance around once more, ignoring the small stands of trees here and there, looking more for the fire's status in burning out or somewhere warm to relax in.  No. . . <i>attempt</i>  to relax.  She figured that sleep would be hard to accomplish after the wild chase through the dense forests and the wandering over the wind-blasted field.  A shimmer of a glittering light caught her eye and she turned around quickly, searching out exactly what had drawn her attention.  Sunlight danced like sure footed faeries over the surface of a seemingly large lake off a ways from where she had paused.  The light darted over the surface quickly, racing each other to the other side and disappearing into the waving reeds.  For some reason she was caught with just watching the sunlit water, a light smile feeling it's way upon her muzzle.<br />
<br><BR>The slashing of cold wind brought her out of her reverie, shaking her face a few times to clear her boggled mind and she shivered as she got back to all fours.  Time to get more distance covered, get the town behind her in miles and in her memories.  The further away; the saner she'd remain.  On this slightly up-lifting thought, she started up her trotting lope down the gentle slope of the ridge, covering the dried grass land quickly now, driven by the cold to move as fast as possible.<br />
<br><BR>Milk would be at the end of this journey.  She'd make sure of that.  Persuasiveness was a skill she had picked up years ago, even before she learned of her true nature.  It only helped, being in the form of a cat, to beg anything from towns' people.  A roof over her head; a good, rich creme sitting heavily in her stomach; a hand stroking over her back to sooth her to sleep.  Yes, a cat was a good thing to be.  Nose wrinkling up as her mind wandered back into this train of thought, she sneezed and shuddered from a chill that darted it's way down her spine, sending her fur to stand on end.<br />
<br><BR>A cat was a good thing to be.  Most of the time.  At least if one didn't connect the fact that she and a human self were the same being.  And one didn't connect that silly notion until one saw the nauseating, bone molding shift she had to do when going from one self to another.  As quickly as she could, she moved all of her attention to the path before her.  It was over.  She had escaped, and as far as she knew, no one had followed after her.<br />
<br><BR>As of yet.<br />
<br><BR><i>Blasted,</i> she snapped into her mind. <i> Shut-up.  Just shut-up!</i>  So now she was arguing with herself;  something done quite often, a conversation in her mind to fix problems; to answer questions only she would be able to answer.  They could be following after her, but if they were, the hunt had been called off because there was not one sign of pursuit.<br />
<br><BR>In her little episode of calming her wild thoughts, she had failed to notice the path had changed from grassy weeds to a well used dirt road.  Moments of grinding her soft pads into the gritty dirt finally worked their way up to her attention and she paused, eyes dropping to where she was going.<br />
<br><BR>Falling into that cliche of chuckling, the kitten sat her rounded rump down in the middle of the travel-worn path and surveyed her new destiny.  She had no idea what would happen next, nor did she have mind to want to pursue that notion of seeking out a destiny.  That was utter nonsense; the idea that her life was already planned out for her.</p>
