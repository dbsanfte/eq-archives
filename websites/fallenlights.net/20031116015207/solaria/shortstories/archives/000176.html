<br>Slay the Dragon!<br>

<br>

<p>If I could remember the question I would post it up here.. it was something to do with spending a day as someone else... no specifics. so again I used my overly done imagination and came up with this.. wrote it in senior year at highschool.. my teacher loved it.. told me to use this one to get into the school... so I did.. and apparently they liked it to.. for here I am.. in college.. *woop-di-doo*<br />
<BR><br>I'm going to tell you right now and only once - so get it clear - I don't save damsels in distress.  You can go next store and Frederick will gladly rescue a fair-skinned, golden-haired princess for you.  If you have a handsome prince locked in a tower in the middle of nowhere, well . . . that's a different story.  But, my main menu is monsters that are terrorizing the innocent, or fire-breathing dragons that like to eat people or their pets just for a bit of fun in their boring lives.<br />
<BR><br>Oh, you want me to save your town from a two headed dragon that has been eating your crops?  Then I'm the one for you.  You have any princes that might also be needed to be saved?  No?  Just checking.  This is great anyway.  Dragons - especially two-headed ones with fire shooting out of their noses - are my favorites to slay.  They give me a challenge that a normal monster doesn't provide.<br />
<BR><br>Just the other day I pulled a green scaled, fiery breath dragon from his slumber and warned him that if he chased the sheep over and around the pastures one more time, I'd personally skin him.  So the stupid creature has taken up a new hobby - chasing people.  If you need to see if I'm up to what you're looking for, then you can trail behind and watch me in action, just as long as you stay hidden - I don't need to save you from the dragon.<br />
<BR><br>First, let me get my gear over here - a silver sword coated in magic by one of my dear friends, Merlin.  Our King had given it to me when I saved him a from three-headed hydra - he didn't need it any more, and thought that my old, dented blade was due for retirement.  And this is a shield from a far off place - I think in the Orient - and it too has been given a special lacquer paint by the Magician.  It's fireproof.  You can have this grey one and, don't worry, the dragon won't think that you're a tasty tidbit, he's got me to deal with.<br />
<BR><br>He was last seen flying over in the pastures by the southern end of town, with about four really cute gentlemen tearing across the green grass in front of his steamy breath.  No, he doesn't hurt anyone, but would you like to be chased just for a few minutes for a good laugh?  I don't.  So now he has to be taught a lesson.  How hard can it be?  He's only about thirty feet from snout to tail - just a baby.  It's a pity he wasn't smart enough to leave this town alone, I'm going to miss him.  The little guy likes to whirl about in the air, as if he was a puppy chasing its tail.  Very cute.  Look, you can see him as we get past this last house, over there by the sun.<br />
<BR><br>Scared all of a sudden?  Well, you can wait here, or go down by the tree and hide in the shade.  I'll give you a moment to think about it while I check that my armor is well oiled.  So, you decided on going down to the tree?  That's a good choice, you can get a better view from down there.<br />
<BR><br>I've got to go to the middle of the field, but I'll be right back. . . .<br />
<BR><br>Well, am I the one for the job?  That dragon was easy.  He went down after only three piercings in his heart.  With the larger ones, I have to chop off their head(s).  You see how I did it cleanly?  Unlike other heroes - the macho types - I didn't make him suffer by cutting off a foot, then his tail, then another foot, and then kill him after he hobbled about for a while.  I went right for his heart.<br />
<BR><br> Am I okay?  Of course.  It's only a scratch.  The spike at the end of his tail found a weak spot in my armor.  It's only a little blood.  You know, you worry too much.  I've bled like this before, well, maybe not as much, but I can handle it.<br />
<BR><br>But, on second thought, can you carry me back to my shop?  It's suddenly getting too dark, and I can't see the way. . . .<br />
