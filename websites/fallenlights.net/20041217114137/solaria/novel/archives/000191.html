<br>
<br>Three Witches<br>

<br>

<p>"I am the First Witch." A voice shattered utter silence of a snow covered mountain. &nbsp;<i>--irst Witch...</i> replied the echo, humming around the small group of gathered nobles. &nbsp;Each and every one of them, including the man in silver chain mail, lifted their heads just a slight hair more. &nbsp;Eyes darted about, some narrowing, hands dropping to swords.</p>



<p>A slender shadow glanced along the snow of the mountain's pass, elongated by the fading sun past the crest. &nbsp;Some moments later, after the men believed themselves alone again, a voice as crystal sharp as a hawk's beak spoke up in place of the harsh rasp. "I am Xanne, sister of the First Witch" <i>--irst Witch...</i> came the soft undertones of the echo once more.</p>



<p>This time, a few of the bolder ones drew swords.</p>



<p>"And I am The Unnamed, the other." This last voice was as light as a feather floating to its death. &nbsp;This was the one that appeared to them first. &nbsp;She was the youngest of the three, shrouded in a silk veil, body wrapped in a cloak of fur, a hint of silver covering what would have been her face. &nbsp;Two other shadows though flittered along the pass. &nbsp;All three women were masked.</p>



<p>Voices, three of them in harmony spoke one last time. "We are the Witches. &nbsp;We are the ones you seek..." A slight pause as if waiting for a heart to beat. "We wait for the First King." <i>--irst King...</i></p>



<p>Swords that were held out as defense lowered slowly, as one. &nbsp;Before the gathered group of frozen, snowy men hovered a woman in black, her eyes the color of autumn. &nbsp;One man tilted his head some and frowned to himself, noting that the feet of the woman were nearly a full hand's span from the surface of the snow. &nbsp;This man, with an iron ringlet crossing over his brow stepped forward, point of his long sword digging into the ground. &nbsp;He dropped heavily to one knee. &nbsp;Pressing his fist against his breast, he bowed his head as if indicating he was less then this one woman. "I am the First King," he spoke solemnly, as if reciting before the alter of one of the gods. &nbsp;Keeping his eyes upon the feet of the woman, he was able to see when the other two sisters pushed through the snow to join their sister; their feet were within the snow, though not as deep as to press down against the ground.</p>



<p>"You are here for a purpose, First King." <i>--irst King...</i></p>



<p>Hard, gray eyes lifted just for the briefest of moments to study the women, all wrapped in fur and silk. &nbsp;Unseen faces, but each voice was different, and one could tell that each had their status. &nbsp;Two did not dare over step one, and that one was she, Rennin. &nbsp;Clearing his throat of the cold, his eyes fell to the feet again, looking at their shadows. "I seek the <i>Ave'sea Inna</i>."</p>



<p>Whispers followed. &nbsp;Faces were unseen. "She has it."</p>



<p>"She--" Air was all that he spoke to, he realized as the feet, the shadows vanished into nothingness, the gasps from behind making what he saw the truth. &nbsp;The three sisters were gone. <br> <br>The silence shattered once again, but not by the chilling sound of whispers. &nbsp;No, it was the grumbling of cold men, having walked so far and so north to seek out this sword. &nbsp;He paid them no heed, listening to his own thoughts instead. &nbsp;Listening to the short conversation with the witches that lasted but a few seconds. &nbsp;They had called him the First King. &nbsp;He was the King of man. &nbsp;Those behind him, now loyal subjects. &nbsp;It left a wonderful ring in his head as he thought about it further, pushing himself up from the snow to stand once again. &nbsp;Lifting his chin some, he gave a calculating look over the gathered men, they each returning their own. &nbsp;They knew as well, they had heard the witches speak. &nbsp;Each one returned to standing, some shifting on their feet as the looked where the witches had been.</p>



<p>He could understand, it was uneasy to be speaking to masked women that hovered in the air; ones that vanished when there was no need to speak further. &nbsp;The leather of his gloves strained as he balled his fists, the words returning, pushing through the news of him being a King. &nbsp;"She? &nbsp;She who?" he mused softly, stepping through the snow. &nbsp;Someone else held the <i>Ave'sea Inna</i> in their hands.</p>



<p>* * * </p>



<p>As the First King gave his attentions to his greedy quest and his gathered men and then finally the trail home, the three sisters that spoke as one removed themselves from that side of the mountain. &nbsp;The two youngest ones trudged through the snow, their long black dresses staining the pureness like spilt ink; the oldest who was greater, floated above the icy crust, her bare toes never once grazing the cold. &nbsp;None shivered, though, in the chilly world.</p>



<p>Each wore a silver mask, held to their face by velvet cords. &nbsp;Emotionless. &nbsp;Ageless. &nbsp;Calm and serene, hiding their visage from those they believed to be no more then a wrinkle to iron out in their life, something to dust under the rug. &nbsp;The mask was cool against their skin. &nbsp;Plain in design, though they reflected light as if the clearest crystals. &nbsp;There were four such masks, created by the elves eons ago, before man had crawled from the clay and shadows, before magic could be harnessed by anything less then a god. &nbsp;Three were stolen by the witch sisters before the wars, before the need to create relics such as the <i>Ave'sea Inna</i>. &nbsp;The other still belonged to the Goddess of the Moon. &nbsp;Inna, as she was called by those of mortal stock.</p>



<p><i>I wonder if Sahfed Koh gave her the sword.</p>



<p>In time he will. &nbsp;Well before the man king finds out which she you spoke of. <br> <br>He does not understand. &nbsp;He does not know whom we spoke of, dear sister.</i> &nbsp;One mask lifted slightly, turning to face the other young sister as they conversed to each other silence. &nbsp;The elder merely floated along, as if oblivious to the words of her two sisters. &nbsp; <i>He will use </i>Ave'sea Inna <i>as we would not wish.</p>



<p>Does that matter?</i> &nbsp;The words that sheered through the thoughts burned as rough as acid, but a delicate as the touch of a mother to her first child. Sahfed Koh has yet to give the girl the sword, the king does not know which girl has it, though he will suspect soon.</p>



<p><i>Soon?</i> &nbsp;Curious of curious, the youngest, The Unnamed arched an unseen brow at the First Witch.</p>



<p><i>When she learns what it is that she holds, he will suspect.</i></p>



<p>The three fell silent, no longer a need to talk. &nbsp;They contented themselves with their journey through the mountain pass, listening to the wind as it cut through the snow and ice.</p>
