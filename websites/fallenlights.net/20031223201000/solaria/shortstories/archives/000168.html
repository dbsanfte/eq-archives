<br>
<br>Something<br>

<br>

<p><p>Vibrating, lashing cords that lay the silence of the air to rest, taking its place like a wailing wind coming down from the woods.  It was a gentle hum at first, the tone beginning of a soft mother's lament over a child that's last breath was soon to come; slowing building in temper as notes added atop the dry pulse, aggravating it.  Violence began to seep in gently, seeking a place to lay it's hurtful cords within the calmed collective of noise.  Like a grasping finger of a predator, it sought out one quiver that seemed to weaken, latching on tightly and squeezing, a boa constrictor of strength, and strain in the noise.  This was how the wail of the north wind was, gentle and seductive to ease them to believe the rightfulness of it's duty, then aggressive and rough like the back hand slap of the angered, searing to rip skin from bone at its brutal force.  It was a war of sound, clashing and beating down upon the breeze, stirring its temper to that which was more suited for a gust of the cold.  Sound was glaring, hurtful to make them run, hands pressing over ears to block the dreadful.<br /><br />
<br><BR><i>Come now.</i><br /><br />
<br><BR>Fingers curling tightly around the strumming cords of the wind, yanking it back into tight weaves that had a tempo, a sense of order.  Pulling back on the north wind, to remove it from the wood and the gully where it would dip and falter like one of newness.<br /><br />
<br><BR><i>Be good.</i><br /><br />
<br><BR>Something that could not exist.  Good was irrelevant, noise was the essence and lust of this driving force, the cry and the wail and the moan that it carried along while dipping past the gully and into the valley.  Something that did exist for it to drive out, herding it like a flock of sheep over the valley that it now passed by, diving deep along the crashing chaos of the foaming seas.  Good was the opposing force that sought to block its penetration any further.  That was a challenge, and most things lived off of a challenge, sucking it into their arms like a mother pulling a child to her breast.<br /><br />
<br><BR><i>Come.  Now!</i><br /><br />
<br><BR>It was an order.  The hum that had started this was long forgotten as the counterpoint beat harder, aching to swell and become unbearable.  Pain was good, somewhat of a contradiction of a thing that worked to drive it from existence.  And so it drove back against the order, pressing in from the shore of the pulsing, drumming of the waves, dancing over the reeds to bend them at its screaming will.  Snapping and breaking was pain, screaming was pain, moving was pain that could be and would be given as the journey rolled over the plains, going higher, and higher and higher.  Thunderous ebbs of vibrations snarled along the length of the white tipped mountains, darting past and over to surround, then fall back yet again to a valley.<br /><br />
<br><BR><i>Well?</i><br /><br />
<br><BR>It gathered force and rolled over a bridge that had sides that lead to nothing, rolling down and out of sight on the right and the left, only to crash with a burst of crying into a face of a cliff.  Whining out like a mewling babe, south was the answer as the cliff shifted in protest to drop away from sight as the noise left, moving its way over a plain, then a mountain, another plain of greater distance.  Whirl winds of fluting hisses traveled as the now south going wind's underbelly was snagged within a small dip.  Forest rose up before it yet once more.  And yet again there was that ache that needed to stop its advances.  Mother's cry began again as they sensed the torments return, having become used to the gentle tones of the breeze.  A gale force was too much for them.  Once again there was a shudder and a wail of pain and a faint purr of notes being struck by a curling finger.  One that tried to pluck the forceful gust to a beat that was more soothing and less stress against the whimpering hums that resided.  Pain was good.  And so again it did not yield, wanting to bring this contradiction.  Sound again became a harsh grate, forcing a wail from the meeker them, a cry for it to just go away.  The violent curled in upon itself just once, as if considering to be considerate to the pleas.  Which suddenly stopped.<br /><br />
<br><BR><i>Better.</i></p></p>
