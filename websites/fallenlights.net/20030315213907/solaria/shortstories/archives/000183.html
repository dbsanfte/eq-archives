<div align=justify>
<p><p>an example of how i get stories sometimes, role-playing them out first (written back in 1998 or so, I write out stories differently now.)</p></p>

<p><p><br /><br />
*A pale light.. faint at first appeared in the clouds above.. cutting through the sky like a bolt of lightning.. streaking down and down.. a plummet towards the earth below.. the light grew tremdousily fast.. a slash of purity in the black sky.. though what soured down as if falling wasn't a pure thing.. it was truly fallen.. cut from the heaven's cord and lost to them above.. others cut her down.. so she fell like a rock..*</p></p>

<p><p>*Feathers drifted behind as she streaked wildly through the air like some insane hawk on a mission to kill.. here wings were white.. glowing almost from a droplet of sun that had made it after her through the dark clouds.. and slowly they dispersed.. a shifting in the currents of wind.. pushing the broiling masses of billowed water droplets away like heavy storm waves in the great oceans.. she paid no heed.. she was lost in memories of her fall.. of the day she meet the demons that dragged and ripped her to peices...*</p></p>

<p><p>*There was a thundrous snap as 15ft span wings arched back and stopped the air from rushing through her tendrels of red hair.. every part of her shuddered with pain as the cold air blasted into her face as she hovered with a stillness.. eyes on the land below.. following the courses of rivers and dots of lakes and smudges of villages.. she knew of one smudge.. but it was lost in the dimness of the whole world below her.. gold eyes sought it out madly.. swirling with agiation when she figured out that her luck in finding the inn and caleb again was hopeless.. her mind.. still lost in the dreamings.. picked up a shriek.. and so she shrilled a responce of fear back.. and dropped again.. wings drawn tightly against her back..*</p></p>

<p><p>*The world blurred in movement as she beat the death to her wings..searing in fire at the way she dropped... then again there was a clap of thunder that rocked the trees from their roots as her wings snapped to halt her descent.. the angel screamed out in anger as her dreams made her see the demons below.. fingers cutting into the air the wrestle her down again.. to slip through her mind again and make her forget.. to undo all the fixing that Caleb did.. her voice to be lanced from use in calling out to the god that ordered her push.. her wings burned to a marred.. twisted mass of dead feathers.. she couldn't let that be.. so she remained in the air.. soaring over the tops of the summer trees.. leaves shifting as she passed over them.... and so she searched for the place she found caleb again..*</p></p>

<p><p>*She let a screaming cry rip through her voice and sear her throat as she flew past the demon's lair.. seeing their hands of black terror slash up.. but pass through her shaking body because of their dream-like state.. she finally realized this.. and she curled her wings up behind her back and dropped herself down to the ground lightly.. remaining standing.. not crouching and searching for a danger she knew wasn't there.. she now felt the leaves on her back from the sapling behind her and grass on her feet as she came to the clearing by a crystiline lake.. a blueness so dark from the clouds it was almost black.. the storm over head raged on..a true storm.. one that had knocked her nearly unconsious and sent her on that moment's plummet.. giving her the feeling that she was falling again like she did not so long back.. her feet curled slightly in the grass.. feeling its softness.. a comfort..*</p></p>

<p><p>*Before her was the one and only place she recognized.. the inn that housed Caleb and herself for so many days when she was being fixed.. she scuffled to the path that wound towards her desintation.. an inn that stood on a slight hill.. surrounded by the forests and mountains she flew over in her fall.. both falls.. the lake was at her side.. something she still feared because of its ability to suck up the light.. to draw in the form into its grasp.. so she moved far from it.. her bare feet becoming dirty on the path she strood down.. wings drawn back to cloak around her gaunt.. pale body of a graceful height.. taller then most female mortals.. but not a height that made her seem giant.. but powerfully dangerous if provoked.. a lithe body that could be carried by the wings.. trailing feathers now dragging in the dirt carelessly.. her red hair was braided into hundreds upon hundreds of plates that fell down between the joints of her shoulders and wings.. over the soft downy protection of where her skin tranformed to feathers.. her face was highly angled.. like a Fae-kind of magic.. but with a softness to it.. more curved.. but as delicate as a bird in structure.. she looked light and easily tossed back by the wind she commanded.. gold eyes held a knowledge.. but held back by the limitations of her hurt mind..hurt by the demons that dragged her away..*</p></p>

<p><p>*Now near the inn that rose before her.. she paused and frowned softly..her eyes searching over the stucco.. over the windows that let light in and svcked light out..with a quick snap.. her wings where out and beating.. lifting her from the ground.. soft white feathers and rigid ones that cut into the air.. yanking her higher to the heavens again.. but not as high.. just enough so that she could set herself down on the peak of the roof.. now crouched for balance.. her wings remaining unfurled abover her.. held out like eagles do when protecting their eggs from harm.. so easy to get away now.. but also a blanket for her body.. still fearing the demons in her mind.. she crawled forward quietly.. searching for the hole in the roof...*</p></p>

<p><p>*From the hole she finally searched out.. she curled in close.. gold eyes peering into the darkness below her.. following the movement of the patrons before she slipped in.. rolling forward carefully to not up set her now drawn in wings.. she dropped to a rafter beam and perched on the balls of her feet.. one hand coming down to rest before her..her back hunched forward.. wings tightly pulled against her back in the small space.. careful to not brush against anything that would send her into convultions.. gold eyes blinked again.. sending a soft light in the darkness.. she was still startled easily by noise.. and the din from below was enough to leave her in quaking shivers.. she hated being alone.. not knowing what was going on.. her voice and speech still struggling to make sense in mortal's ears.. she leaned her face over the edge of the shadows.. a pale light washing up to her.. setting everything aflame for a moment.. giving her paleness a glowing warmth of comfort.. her red hair slipped over her shoulders and dropped around to frame her narrow face.. some strands streaking before her vision in blurred stripes..*<br /><br />
