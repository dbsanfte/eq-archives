<p>If you were to bring the world under one person's grasp...</p>

<p>"How would you do it?" she replied to her thoughts, her gentle fingers strumming through pages of an old manuscript. Intent on something within the words. The elf had been in the library for most of the afternoon, the dinner set at the corner of the table chilled.</p>

<p>Dust covered a good portion of the books that lay in various piles within the chambers. Some stacks came to her waist, others went beyond, enclosing her within a maze. Shelves lined the cracked walls; they alone held the ceiling up. She was virtually trapped by her own doing, for half the piles surrounding her was what she had retrieved from the walls. She needed them all within arms reach.</p>

<p>Lifting her head, she glanced along the floor, absently watching the light slightly shift as the sun began it's last decent into the earth. The dust that filled the air sparkled some in the golden light, reminding her of stories about fairies that danced within the groves of ancient forests. Those of course, were just tales that mothers made up to help the little one fall to sleep. She let out a low sigh as the light continued to recede, as if running from where she was standing, hand absently resting on the loose sheets of words. Cracks were highlighted as it drifted along. Shadows deeped some. And soon it would be too dark to continue pouring through the parchment, for it would risk much by bringing a candle into the old, dusty library to read after the sun had vanished behind the trees and hills.</p>

<p>And so her mind returned to the task under her hand, dark eyes skimming the elven glyphs. It was difficult to decipher, these letters, ancient and in a tongue only a few managed to remember, and even fewer bothered to teach. Lucky for her, her teacher had graced her with the knowledge of at least how to find a code to unlock words even he wasn't sure of. Tiresome and dull this was though, and she wished to herself that someone would have long ago just buckled down and rewritten all the old prophecies and other histories to make it easier on those that... She paused and smiled to herself just slightly, shaking her head a bit. The last time any of these bits of paper were looked at was when they had been written; centuries and ages ago, back when the glyphs were the common tongue. Before the coming of the Man, and long before the Wars. Of course no one would bother translating what they did not know about. Giving up on that hope, she just gave in to the task of searching the Book of Letters while trying to skim what she did know of the old tongue.</p>

<p>She soon became lost within the writings, searching for the clue to answer why.</p>

<p>A few moments had passed though, for the golden light behind her faded fast, slipping away like life blood of one's beloved. As the last of the light created long shadows out of the books, the elf lifted her head, eyes catching the first line, this time understanding the markings. Sheltered in lands unseen, they grew.</p>

<p>Within her chest, she had a feeling quickly throb, sending her breath to catch in her throat. Lifting a hand, she pressed her cool fingers against her neck and took a step away from the rickety table. Her other hand removed itself from on top of the pages, as if suddenly cursed. As she moved back a few steps, her gaze swiveled towards the door that was still shut.</p>

<p>Sheltered in lands unseen, they grew? That was not right. She should not have known those words.</p>

<p>"Dezrid?"</p>

<p>Silence greeted her back as she called for her teacher, thinking it might have been his thoughts within her. She took just one more step before suddenly lurching forward, hands snapping up the manuscripts to clutch to her busom. Worry filled her dark eyes as she scanned the library, looking for pale shadows, for anything that might move. The thoughts had not been her own. Rolling the old papers together, she quickly stuffed them back into their scroll case and set it down against a book shelf, her eyes never once stopping their search of the darkening room.</p>

<p>Then, to her right, there was a skittering of nails upon hard slate floor. Freezing with her stomach in her chest, she slowly straightened. But, by the time she willed her gaze to look upon the creation of such noise, the figure was long gone, back to the shadows where it had come from. Slowly, as her hand drew a slender dagger from its sheath at her hip, she began to make her way towards the door.</p>

<p>What ever it was though, had beaten her to the escape route, growls alerting her before she had gotten not five paces from the shut door. Lips pulled into a gentle frown, eyes lightening from their darkened hue as she searched intently. Her stomach found its way back up to her chest, and her heart died. With white knuckled about the leather wrapped pummel, she found herself just waiting for the thing to emerge from hiding. She knew that if she tried for the door, it would leap at her. Who knew what it was that waited there, and her mind raced through quick possibilties, never once relaxing her tensed stance.</p>

<p>While she looked about, black eyes, gleaming with a lust for hunger looked back at her. The form was hunched down behind a pile of books, greasy claws stilled upon the slate. Not now, had come the order in its animalistic thoughts, and it had obeyed, knowing no other option. The elf had actually looked upon it a few times during the course of the day, but never really had seen it for more then a shadow. Its short, course skin blended well with the slate, rough like stone. All it had to do was close its eyes to fully fade into nothing. Feeling the eyes of the elf look away again, the eyes popped open and watched, holding back its low growl this time. The dagger would harm it if she found the thing, and the mind it was connected to would not be pleased if the creature came back harmed.</p>

<p>Flesh would be nice to grind within its soft mouth, to suckle upon real living flesh, a devine temptation. But, the thought of anger kept it at bay.</p>

<p>After a few moments of not seeing what she sought to find, she frowned and took a few steps closer to the door. Advancing yet once again, her hand reached out to grasp the knob and she twisted, but no growl or pouncing beast revealed itself. Sighing in relief, she pulled the door swiftly open and stepped out into the hall with as long of steps as she could manage, and slammed it closed behind. </p>
