How could it be possible that everyone liked the same things? Just as everyone isn&#146;t turned on by the thought of anal sex, everyone doesn&#146;t like blueberry cake and not everyone falls for bald people, so everyone&#146;s not attracted to both men and women, not even in a kind of a &#148;hidden&#148; way.<BR><BR>But I&#146;m equally sure there&#146;s less and less people who are ashamed of their sexuality, whatever it is. This causes people to have more and more homosexual experiences, as the researches show. As the atmosphere gets more liberated, I&#146;m sure that people e.g. experiment with s&m a lot more than before, even if there hasn&#146;t been made a recent research of this (or at least, not an older research with which to compare it).<BR><BR>It's nice that many bisexuals say thyy don&#146;t fall in love with a gender but with a person, but they, too, have a lot of conditions for their lovers, their skin tone or hair length or something has to be right. Really. So why couldn&#146;t there be people who simply like men only or women only? And even this is not that simple, but there are, of course, differences between people who like &#148;men&#148; or &#148;women&#148;, too. Some like only feminine women, some unfeminine. If someone only falls for fairly androgynous people, is s/he bisexual?<BR><BR>Everyone has got conditions for who they fall in love with and who they want, but only the gender conditions have got names, labels (well, ok, there&#146;s a name for e.g. masochism, but but someone who claims to be a masochist can like vanilla sex as well) and they&#146;re paid the most attention. Luckily, there&#146;s not a word for a person who only fancies long-haired people.<BR><BR><BR><BR> <BLOCKQUOTE>  <BLOCKQUOTE>| <a href=# onClick="window.close();">close window</a> |            </BLOCKQUOTE>  </BLOCKQUOTE></p></font></td></tr></table></body></HTML>
