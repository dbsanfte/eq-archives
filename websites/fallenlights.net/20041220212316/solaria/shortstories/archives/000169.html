<br>Chelta Geverai -- Sacrifice<br>

<br>

<p><p><I>"MOTHER!"</i><br /><br />
<br><BR>Ripping the black spidery-silken shroad from her lithe body, letting it flutter to the ground like a dying ghost, she stormed down the narrow confines of her mother's dark mansion, following the twists and turns quickly and blindly, following by instinct and rage.  Long white tendrils flew out as she broke into a run, snarling lightly as she leapt around a servant, coming close to grabbing their throat and flinging them into a vase.  She'll kill her.  And everyone else if the rumors were true.  Every muscle within her tall form was tense with anger, her eyes blood red in the dim corridore, seeking out her mother. <i>That bitch,</i> she hissed into her thoughts as she rounded yet one more corner.  Parting her lips, she tore her throat out again with yet one more scream of the purest hate. <strong> "MO<i>THER!"</strong></i><br /><br />
<br><BR>One of the head servants ran out into her sight, waving his boney arms in the air frantically to get her to silence. He whimpered as he dropped to his knees out of respect for the eldest Daughter, but looked up at her, a hand darting out to catch at her pants.  "Mis-stress, the L-lady is in the T-temple."  He was quaking with fear, fear that she gave him when she stopped and glared down at him.  Her eyes burned into his and she snarled, spitting onto his ebon skin.<br /><br />
<br><BR>"So?  Go get her!" she ranted as she hooked her fingers into his collar, nails drawing blood as she tore at his collarbone, and bodily flung him down the hallway before her.  Her boot heels clicked loudly on the cold marble stone of midnight shadows, following after the scurrying servant.  Her shroad of a cloak now lay in a pile behind her, before another servant darted from the shadows to pick it up and wisked away before noticed by the Lady's daughter.<br /><br />
<br><BR>She didn't see anything behind her.  It was what was before her that mattered, what she was growling at from deep inside her chest, sending her into a lunitic rage of fury.  But, she held this back until the right moment, dispelling some of the overflow once in a while by digging her claw-like nails into the walls, shreading paintings across the properly tilted chins and down cast eyes of past Ladies of the House.  A few delicate vases tilted as she nudged her hip into the edge of a table or three, smiling faintly as she muttered, when she heard the shatter of porcelne onto the hard rock surface.  She traced her nails over the carving in the oak, stained black this time of the season to match her mother's dark mood.  Chuckling, she broke off a few carved leaves that seemed soft and pliable to the touch, and scattered them behind her.  Again, servants drifted out of the shadows like frightened wraiths and scooped up the cluter, removing the damanged paintings from the walls, and tucked them away as they made their way quickly out of her earshot.<br /><br />
<br><BR>She then paused and looked around at her surroundings, purring lightly as she pushed the heated anger back into her gut, loving the ache that it made, a soft pulsing throb of dulled pain she dwelled on.  "This better just be a rumor, Mother," her voice fluttered into the crack in the Temple's doorway, magically pushed to reach her Mother's ears meters down in the darkness, waifting around like a slippery film of oil on her skin.  Of all the things to happen to her, but this?  She snarled just in thought of hearing the words of the sacrifice to the GoddessQueen.  For some reason, she kept her calmness steady as the still air of the cave-like House, quiet surrounding her, except for the echos of her heart cries for her Mother that bounced around down further in the pitch blackness of the seemingly never ending hallway.  Tricks of magic, this whole House was one trick of the eye, corners were the hallway continued on straight, making the place seem like a castle, like one of the higher Houses, trying to look more important.<br /><br />
<br><BR>"If you want to believe it to be, then yes, it is," came the answer a moment later, more into her thoughts then hitting her delicate ears.  The voice was deep and old, filled with wisdom and calmness that only the centuries of living in the basking warmth of the darkness could bring.  Her Mother sounded angry at her for the disturbance, for there was a sharp undertone to the honeyed voice.  As if she cared.  Another smirk pulled on the corners of her black lips, tugging them until she growled when the words of her Mother registarred in her mind, even more when she felt the lock of magic pinning her in place.  She snapped her head up and screamed again.  "Mother!  How <i>dare </I> you do this to me!"<br /><br />
<br><BR>It, like before, was a few moments before she got her answer.  Her face was whipped sharply to the side and she let out a manical growl, spitting into the eyes of a guard that had recently appeared besides her, his hands clamped to her upper arm.  Her Mother had sent a slap through the doorway, hard air buffeting against her cheek, stinging sharply.  She forced her anger down, it being a pointless act to waste at this moment.  Her Mother, despite her age, was still far more powerful when it came to the Art.  Rolling her eyes up so to not look as the tiny stature of a figure glided to the door, opening them with a touch of her finger, swinging inward.  Another guard appeared at her opposite side and grabbed her arm as well, then together, they hauled her into the Temple Chamber.  She screamed out in fury when she saw that it was helpless, yet she would not become the willing servant to her Mother's desires.  Cheek still swollen from the punch, she kicked her legs around and out, and succeded in tripping one of the guards.<br /><br />
<br><BR>She sent herself sprawling out across the floor, one guard half clinging to her, half grabbing for her, rolled to her back and sent her boot heel smashing into his nose, delighting in pleasure when she saw blood drip over his lips and splash on his clothes as he stood up.  Chuckling lightly, her eyes drifted to the other guard, and he too, was down and out for the moment, too embarassed to try and prop himself up onto his elbows, so he just laid there pathetically while she crawled away into the shadows.<br /><br />
<br><br>Her Mother was ignoring her now, her mind set back on perfecting the altar for the sacrifice that would take place only a few, horribly few moments from now.  And the wait was tantilizing harsh on her tensed body, contorting herself into a curled up shadow against the wall.  Not that she wanted the attention, she wanted to be left alone to boil within, a searing pain that ripped up and down her throat.  Her face was dead still as she remained back, unable to do anything just yet, the surging angers that were rising and falling like bile of some dreaded sickness cut through her throat, leaving a rancid taste on her tongue.  Swallowing hard, she jerked her head up like a rabid beast as the guards moved towards her, their orders now clear.<br /><br />
<Br><BR>She would watch it all.<br /><br />
<Br><BR>Everything within her body burned up to nothing, her mind went blank as their hands swooped down and fingers twisted tightly around her now limp arms, tightly enough so that her ebon skin became a shine of dead blue.  She was lifted to her feet and nearly kicked back over to the center of the room.  The form of her tiny Mother was huddled over the slate alter, carved with the bones of past sacrificees, carving tools set out in the corner to await this new death.  As her eyes roamed over the ancient creature that was her Mother, she suddenly realized that there were other priestesses within the Temple Chambers.  Gritting her teeth, she spit out, "Mother.  What is all this for?"<br /><br />
<br><BR>The crone's white topped head lifted slightly and red eyes lined by webs of deep crevices turned and focused on her eldest Daughter.  "You should know Chelta, after all.  It was all your fault," she purred back with a lisp on her tongue.  "So you will be the guest of honor."</p></p>
