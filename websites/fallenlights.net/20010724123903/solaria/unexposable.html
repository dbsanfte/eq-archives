She fancies herself a writer and a dreamer and an artist.  More blurbs of short phrases are easier and more fluid for her to create, though attempts had been made, no matter how futile they end up becoming in the long run.  There are beautiful things that need to be written about, like the darkness of the shadows slightly toned blue upon two day old snow cast by the light of a winter's sun at three in the afternoon, it's more of a feeling that comes from staring blankly into the harsh blue sky and seeing all the landscape.  A feeling of memories and something never held; something lost but glimpsed upon.  Words come from her mouth that never make sense and confuse others, but she cares not, for she rather likes being different and odd.  It took her a while, years infact, to get used to the idea that she just was not meant to be understood.
<br><br>
Eyes are important.  The twist of a brow before speaking tells her of the fiercness of the words about to be said.  She'd rather sit back and watch people then to join in the fun, more so at parties and gatherings.  She hears much but doesn't say that she's paying attention--oftentimes, she really doesn't hear a thing.
<br><br>
It's a way to let all the random worlds loose from inside her mind before they become twisted into fine knots, never to be undone again.  Words spill out at a rate slower then how she thinks, and she lacks the ability to go back into the sentences and make them whole, so more often then not, they are left to rot.  There is so much hidden away in notebooks, to never be seen by eyes other then her own.
<br><br>
The few up here she deemed good enough to be read by strangers.
<br><br>
She was born with a name out of a book her mother read, Laura.  The middle name of Anne was that of her mother's, the last because that name is taken from her father's side of the family.  Changed by people years and generations back because they couldn't spell the orignal last name, and now it is lost, buried with the dead.  For odd reasons, it is comforting for her to talk as if not herself writing it, and so it will stay this way, never to utter an "I, me, myself".  Never to talk like this in person though, just when writing to faceless screens that put the words up for someone's eyes to absorb in.
<br><br>
There are no disorders.  She is normal, just a bit on the quirky side.  Her childhood was a pleasant one, highschool was pure hell and college was liberating.  She found out who she was, and who she could pretend to be.
<br><br>
She grew up finally when she became 18, finally gained attentions of those of the opposite sex.  She gained a relationship that will last forever with one in particular, one that makes life hellish when they're appart, waiting and waiting the days away til the next time they see each other.
<br><br>
She was taught how to talk, yet that still is a big struggle, and much is still buried within her chest, too nervous to speak about wrongness.  It makes her fear.  She never really knows what makes her cry, her mother called her over-sensative, it worries one person constantly.  It'll pass.  She'll become brave.
<br><br>
One day.
