<p>(writen around 1996-7 for ny state regents exams. We had to write something based on the Title given with each story.) </p>

<p>On the Horizon </p>

<p>Smoke rose far off on the Horizon. </p>

<p>The source was not able to be seen clearly from their location, but the dragons knew that it was there. Overwhelming black clouds from the unseen volcano concealed the sun, and left the earth in a false twilight. </p>

<p>The strange travelers paused from their long trek to quench their thirst. They drank from a stream that slowly twisted toward their destination, a solitary path in a barren land. They had been following it for so long that they had lost track of time. </p>

<p>The dragons knew that they would have to face danger, knew that some would not see their new home. They had faced far greater evil back in their old volcano, they did not understand how they were so easily conquered by such small beings, which now were changing the homeland, bending it to their will. </p>

<p>The dragons needed the fire that awaited them in their new home for without it they would perish without the needed heat. If they didn't have it, their blood would freeze, stilling their beating hears and their fiery breath would have no fuel.. </p>

<p>Seeing that the others were done drinking, the eldest bellowed into the deceiving twilight and sprung into the air, unfolding his wings. The others followed him into the sky. The air was full of gleaming bodies of ruby, amethyst, emerald, and sapphire, bringing color into the grey world. Their downbeats of their wings created small clouds of dust. Slowly as they turned to the lone path they each said their own farewell to the home they knew for all their lives. They would no longer trust anyone. </p>

<p>Or let them into the new home they had not yet reached far off on the horizon. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Learning From Failure </p>

<p>The officer looked up at the hole leading to the universal war going on, on the planet of Sirrus. He sighed, knowing that the Lords of Earth hadn't learned their lesson, yet. This was the third time that they had opened a gateway to the battle site. Maybe this time they will learn that the aliens can't be defeated by mortal humans. Three-forths of the troops are either killed or taken captive. Maybe this time they will learn, but the chances were slim. </p>

<p>The General looked over at his troops. He didn't know any of their names; he didn't want to know them. He knew that if he came out of this alive, he would return with about twenty of the men and women of two thousand. There was nothing he could do; he wasn't in charge. If he was, he wouldn't be sending anyone on this suicide mission to Sirrus. He had learned that two loses won't bring them a third. Maybe this time the Lords will learn, probably not. </p>

<p>The Lords looked over their troops. All these people, going to be killed for no reason. They knew. These people won't come home, not this time, not ever. The first two wars had proved that. They weren't supposed to come home; it wasn't part of the plan. The plan since they had come from their own home, far off on the other side of the galaxy. A plan for population control. A plan that would have helped in the beginning, but now, now it was plan 'b'. Plan 'a' didn't work, though it could have. The humans couldn't learn to work with that one. Now the Lords sent the people over to a certain death, this was plan 'b', a harsh, but sure way of population control. Maybe the people will learn from the failure, or their will be another feeding for the Sirrus aliens. Another pointless war for the population. Maybe they'll learn, but so far learning from failure wasn't working. </p>

<p>City of Stars </p>

<p>He looked around at the dark buildings, wondering why they no longer shined bright colors into the sky. They had been dimming slowly with each of the passing years, until one light shone. His light. A pale blue light flickering slightly on a lonely wall. It will be gone soon, he thought, as will I. </p>

<p>The whole world was like that now, lights that once lit the heavens ablaze, were fading as the shroud of darkness covered each one. The lights left as people left the city, seeking new worlds to shine upon. </p>

<p>The man saw a pale green light appear on a building, brightening as some one came close to the city. Life was coming back to the ghost town, young life, as he saw a small silhouette dancing on the gray street. Young and old meet again. It was he son, a son to take him from the desolate city to one full of light. A smooth hand wrapped tight fingers around wrinkled ones. "Come father," said the boy. "Mother is waiting for you." The man looked from the youthful face to the blank wall, blank except for his pale blue light and the boy's dancing green. He nodded and let the boy pull him away. The blue and green lights dimmed slowly as they passed the city limits. </p>

<p>Saying Goodbye </p>

<p>There were crowds gathering in small bunches on the wharf of the ocean seaport. Overhead, seagulls cried to one another, drowning out the puzzled murmuring of the people. </p>

<p>Most of the gatherers aimlessly standing on the cobbled streets of the harbor were just curious passersby, attracted by the rainbow of flags streaming on the pinnacles of the colony ships' masts. But, there were few, who were clustered closest to the wooden vessels, that had tears on their faces. Wails that echoed the mournful cries of the white birds, pierced the salty air. Those people were saying good-bye to their loved ones. Few weren't crying, but were begging desperately for the brave colonists to stay. It was almost like a funeral; the wayfarers were not dying themselves, but from the life of the ones who they will leave behind. </p>

<p>A shrieking whistle hushed the masses of people. It was a signal for the reluctant, young men to pull away from their mother's tight embraces, to leave them crying on their husband's shoulder. Little children waved good-bye as their fathers walked up the gangplank, not realizing that they would never come home. </p>

<p>A roaring cheer, started in the rear of the crowd, rolled through the farewell party like the crashing waves on the hulls of the clippers. When the wave pealed over the pilgrims, they turned towards the crowd, and waved to them from behind the guardrails. Only one stood silent in the cheering. He scanned the country of his home, remembering how the rising sun colored the city in a golden light, how the people smiled up at him and his companions. Though they waved farewell to their family and friends, deep down inside, they were saying good-bye to their old home. And welcoming a new one. <br />
