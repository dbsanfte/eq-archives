<br>
<br>Elysium<br>

<br>

<p>It was a perfect night. Dark and dreary with just a touch of rain. Shadows seemed to be more than that, twisting and turning to become another breathing form outside of the usual flatness that only made a shape when broken by another object. With hands pressed against the window, brow as well, breath steaming it up to annoy her mother, she watched the shadows walk. She was entranced, stone still and hardly letting any air from her mouth. It was too perfect to disturb with even a noise as quiet as that. <br />
<br><br><br />
The small blonde girl gave a quick glance over her shoulder though as she heard movement from within the kitchen. Pursing her lips, she guessed it was almost time for dinner for it sounded like her mother was heating up the left overs from last night and her older sister handling the china. Rubbing her cold hand over her nose to rid herself of an itch, she decided that she wasn't really hungry and would much rather stare out the window. <br />
<br><br><br />
Giving all her attention back to the outside world, she watched as the shadows seemed to become life again.<br />
<br><br><br />
Licking at her lips she ignored her mother's first call for dinner as well as her sister's that followed soon after. Once she used to miss her father's loud bellow that it was time to eat, but now? She could hardly even remember what he sounded like. It had been years ago. <br />
<br><br><br />
Pressing her face up even more against the glass so that she was contorted in a silly flat way. Opening her eyes as wide as she could, she stared off across the street, watching some lone man stumble as if drunk down the sidewalk. He was in a long trench coat and hat, hand lifted to pull the hat down across his face more. But, then he glanced up as if feeling her eyes upon his back, strangely pale eyes that she was able to see even from that distance and through the light drizzle. <br />
<br><br><br />
Gasping out softly for some air, she sat up straight, ripping her eyes from the windows. She decided that dinner was a good idea now. Her eyes shifted back towards the glass as she dropped off the windowbed, seeing that the man was still there, but not really paying attention to her. He was just standing still as if frozen in time.<br />
<br><br><br />
She still remembered his eyes though, slightly yellowish, peering at her with much intrest. Keeping her eyes on the window, she backed away slowly, wishing she hadn't been looking outside on such a nice night. Her small fingers tugged at her shirt's hem nervously, teething biting hard at her lower lip as she watched with fear rising in her belly. <br />
<br><br><br />
The man was looking at her again. <br />
<br><br><br />
He saw her, even though she was away from the window and dark in the living room. The yellow, pale eyes fixed upon her face, studying intently. Swallowing hard, she stood transfixed for a moment or three, watching as he took his first step towards the house. <br />
<br><br><br />
"MOOOOOOOOOOM!" She shrieked out, spell broken and went tearing into the back room, hands waving in the air to catch her mother's attention. <br />
<br><br><br />
"Ely! No yelling inside." Was the only answer she got back as her mother set the pot onto the table, messing up the perfectly smoothed out lace tablecloth. <br />
<br><br><br />
"But mom! There's a guy!" She pointed wildly behind her, towards the window. No one was there as she too glanced back just to make sure. Feeling silly, she listened to her mother's rebuke about spending too much time daydreaming and not enough time with classwork. About to open her mouth to plead with her, she was then stopped by a knock at the front door. <br />
<br><br><br />
"I wonder who that could be." Mused her mother as she wrung her hands on the apron, whirling around her young child to go and fetch the door.<br />
<br><br><br />
Her mother had been carrying a jug of ice water with her as she went to the door, still wondering who on earth would be calling on such a night. Ely gapped and trotted behind her mother, reaching out to tug her away from opening the door, getting a bad sense that something not good was out there. <br />
<br><br><br />
Probably the man with the yellow eyes. <br />
<br><br><br />
Whimpering at that thought, she stopped in the middle of the hall, fear keeping her feet from taking any more steps. Her teeth went back to making pure havoc of her lip, sucking in some blood as she bite down a bit too hard. <br />
<br><br><br />
In stunned silence, as her older sister came to stand behind her, then passed her as mother reached the door, she waited to see who was there. There was a faint click as her mother undid the lock and peeked out around the door as she opened it a crack. <br />
<br><br><br />
Then the loud shattering of glass hitting the floor and a thump of a body a moment later, a whisper of a name.. "Jon?"<br />
<br><br><br />
The 'Jon' stood there silently, eyes turned down towards the fainted woman. He seemed different, thought Ely as she watched him from her hidden spot by the shadows, fidgeting her fingers together. Like, cold and stiff, blood missing from his usually red face. Lifting his blank eyes to glance at her older sister, she stepped back a few feet into the shadows more, too scared to leave, hands pressed against the wall that she leaned against for support. <br />
<br><br><br />
"Hello, my dear." he let out a cracked noise that should have been a nice, gentle base of a voice, lurching forward quickly to grab her sister's shoulder. The girl let out a piercing scream. <br />
<br><br><br />
Ely just watched, transfixed, hating.<br />
<br><br><br />
She stood still, her older sister that is, staring up at her father's eyes, unable to free herself despite all the struggles she fought with. Ely, from her spot far away, heard a sickening pop of bones being snapped from joints, another scream of pain bursting from her sister's lips. Her father seemed to not notice the noises at all, and continued to grip tightly. <br />
<br><br><br />
Then, with a furious look filling in his eyes, giving a red glint to the dull sheen, he yanked the girl close and picked her up so that she was dangling feet from the ground. Hugging her limp, yet twitching body, he did something that made Ely come close to being glad she had nothing in her stomache to throw back up. <br />
<br><br><br />
He leaned his head a bit and brought his daughter's neck to his mouth and bite down hard. Blood gushed quickly in rivulets down her body, which had shook hard once, then went still. The screams fell quite as well. As he drunk deeply of his daughter's life, bear hugging her tightly to his broad chest, the mother stirred and woke up. <br />
<br><br><br />
But she only managed to stay half seated for a moment, seeing the sight of her daughter's neck half eaten away causing her to slip back into unconsiousness. <br />
<br><br><br />
Ely just stood there, hoping that her father did not remember that he had another daughter. She winced some, having had to look away from that nausating scene of murder, as the sound of a body hitting the floor filled the near dead silence.<br />
<br><br><br />
Her mother though. . . . <br />
<br><br><br />
She glanced up, forcing her eyes open after a few moments of silence had passed. Her father, big and burly with a shock of matted down red hair--which she realized to be blood, for his hair should have been blonde--was bent over her mother's fainted form, toeing her with his grimy boot. Holding her tongue between her teeth, she kept from running up to him and beating her hands against his back to get him out of the house. She didn't, even though knowing that this probably meant that her mother was to die like her sister, move though. She couldn't even move back to go and ring up the police, having a gut feeling that they wouldn't believe her at all. Who would believe in the idea that her father was eating her family? <br />
<br><br><br />
But, in surprise, as she watched fearfully, her father only picked up his wife's body and slung her over his shoulder. They were gone in an instant. Blinking, Ely rubbed her eyes and ran to the opened door, looking out but not seeing either of them on the street. Letting out a pitiful sound, she dropped to the steps and sat there, not knowing what to do. <br />
<br><br><br />
Behind her, her sister bleed onto the carpet only a little bit, most of it having been drunk by her father.<br />
