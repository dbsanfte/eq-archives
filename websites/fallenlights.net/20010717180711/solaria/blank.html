<p align=justify>Welcome to Ny'Solaria... <br><br>
This is the third layout since adding the novel to my collection of writing, and the umpteenth version since the beginning. <br><br>
There is one new story added with this new look... The Dreaming in The Novel section... <br><br>
Navigation is as follows: <br><br>
The Novel :: Ny'Solaria novel <br><br>
Short Stories :: a random collection of roleplays that I changed into stories as well as a few strange things.. <br><br>
Everything Else :: Guestbook, VERY brief autobiog., and Links. [Please sign the book on your way out, I like getting other people's feedback, good or bad.]
<br><br>
Please be patient with loading, some stories are over 20k in size.  And the back link will bring you to the main menu.
