A bone thin man with black dreadlocks was walking down a street in Kaisaniemi, Helsinki, with his collar up, like he was freezing in spite of the hot summer weather. Across the street, a blonde woman in a short dress was walking towards him and recognised him from far away.<br><br>
The woman, Mandy, hurried her steps as she approached the man, crossed the street and shouted from dozens of meters away: &#148;Joonas!&#148; Joonas glanced up, and seeing his face, Mandy came to think about how beautiful he had once been. Now he looked sick. Joonas returned his gaze to the ground and walked on, like trying to pass Mandy by, but she asked:<br><br>
&#148;Where are you heading to?&#148;<br><br>
&#148;To buy meat&#148;, he said, and hurried away.
<br><br>
<br><br>
Mandy balked to her home, thinking about Joonas. They had known each other very well a long time ago, because Joonas had been among the first people Mandy had made friends with after moving to Helsinki from New York. At the time, Joonas had been beautiful and strong and looked around him, like searching for challenge. Mandy had met him at a common friend&#146;s home, the friend was an American, and she&#146;d immediately wanted to spend time with Joonas. She had been almost in love with him, and they had got to know each other well very soon, spent the next years very closely together and suddenly drifted apart, when Mandy had had to spend half a year in New York. The recent quick and weird meeting had been their first one in a year and a half.<br><br>
Joonas had never told Mandy everything like she&#146;d told him. He&#146;d had friends she&#146;d known nothing about, and he&#146;d never introduced them to her. They had always been doing something rather than talking: they&#146;d go to art exhibitions, sit in bars with her friends, or go swimming or biking. Joonas used to like sports, and Mandy had admired his confident appearance and his muscular body.<br><br>
During the weeks to follow, Mandy thought about Joonas a lot. The picture of him, cold and sick, kept coming to her mind. She didn&#146;t have his telephone number or address any more, and she didn&#146;t think about the whole thing so much she&#146;d actually have bothered to even look at the telephone directory. But still, she thought about when she&#146;d been a young student, unsure of herself and an outsider in the surrounding culture, and when Joonas had been her first real supporting pillar in Finland. She didn&#146;t even know if she&#146;d chosen to stay in Finland without him.<br><br>
<br><br>
The next time Joonas and Mandy met was in a few weeks. This time, too, they walked to each other accidentally on the street. Joonas seemed even paler than before, and Mandy was frightened by this unexpected opportunity to talk to him. She walked straight to him this time and grabbed his hand when he&#146;d only barely noticed her approaching. He startled.<br><br>
&#148;What&#146;s wrong with you?&#148; she asked bluntly.<br><br>
&#148;Can you keep a secret?&#148; Joonas replied. Mandy nodded, confused, and he asked her to follow. He walked before her without looking at her and led her a few blocks away, to a prefabricated apartment house. He opened the front door and guided her down to the cellar right away.<br><br>
One door had a company&#146;s name, unknown to Mandy, on it, and Joonas walked to that door and opened it. The room they came to was dark, but instead of turning on the lights, he walked swiftly to a corner. Mandy felt the walls to find a switch, but didn&#146;t, so she blinked and tried to get used to the darkness until she could tell some figures from the darkness.<br><br>
There was a cage in the corner. In the cage, there was something white, and it moved and rustled a little when Joonas approached it. Mandy stepped forward with caution. At first, she thought there was a naked little girl in the cage.<br><br>
The creature hunching in the cage wasn&#146;t actually like a child, anyhow, but more like a miniature human the size of a ten-year-old child. It had a petite head and almond-shaped green eyes. On its head was coarse black hair. Mandy breathed deeply. The creature had strange, misshapen beauty to it. Sleepy, it opened its eyes a bit wider and looked at her.<br><br>
&#148;What... who is that?&#148; Mandy asked and reached for the cage with her hand. The creature&#146;s eyes opened wide and it made a quick movement towards her.<br><br>
&#148;Watch out now&#148; was what Joonas had the time to say, but before she could take her hand away, the creature had grabbed it and bit her so that it hurt. Mandy squealed from pain and shock.<br><br>
&#148;It bit me!&#148; Mandy squeezed her hand, which was dripping with blood. <br><br>
&#148;At least don&#146;t waste it&#148;, said Joonas calmly, and handed her a cup.<br><br>
&#148;What?&#148;<br><br>
&#148;She wants blood&#148;, he said calmly. &#148;It doesn&#146;t matter to you whether you give it to her now or not.&#148;<br><br>
Mandy looked at Joonas, who seemed to be serious. She felt confused and upset, but at the same time, she couldn&#146;t but pity that beautiful person or monster lying here, imprisoned in a cellar. At first, she couldn&#146;t do anything, and she stood still for a while, looking first at Joonas and then at the white beast, that was looking away. Then she was overtook by disgust for the whole exceptional episode.<br><br>
&#148;I&#146;m going away now&#148;, she said awkwardly and left the room half running, went up the stairs and on to the street, clutching her still bleeding hand with the other.<br><br>
<br><br>
During the days to follow, the two cuts on Mandy&#146;s hand scarred, and every time she glanced at her hand, she thought about the small, weird thing in the cellar of Joonas&#146;s house. The cuts were next to each other, about five centimetres apart like the creature&#146;s fangs, and long and deep. Mandy felt embarrassed and uncertain, and in less than a week, she started to take for granted the fact that she&#146;d visit Joonas once again to ask a lot of questions and see the strange creature again.<br><br>
When she watched the healing of the wounds, she felt almost sad about how the only proof of the existence of the oddity would disappear. After that, she could think she&#146;d imagined the whole incident, and she&#146;d possibly never dare to find out if the beautiful creature troubling her mind had existed at all.<br><br>
<br><br>
A little over a week from her encounter with Joonas and his extraordinary pet, Mandy decided to call Joonas. The fact that his number was in the phone book almost surprised her. She dialled the number, excited. He didn&#146;t answer that time, and not on the whole day nor the next day, and on the third day she decided to give up calling him and just go to his house.<br><br>
She or her friends didn&#146;t usually visit each other unannounced, and she was nervous. On the way, she reminded herself of the things she&#146;d intended to say at first. She checked Joonas&#146;s last name when she&#146;d come in and didn&#146;t wait for the lift but walked up to the third floor to put off the intimidating moment. Usually, she thought she was an open and social person, but now she was frightened. She rang the doorbell and only then happened to think that maybe Joonas wasn&#146;t home at all. Nobody answered, so she rang again, waited for a moment more, and then left for the cellar, determined.<br><br>
There was no doorbell at the door of the unknown company, so Mandy knocked.<br><br>
&#148;What?&#148; shouted somebody immediately.<br><br>
&#148;It&#146;s Mandy&#148;, said Mandy, and immediately felt like she spoke clumsy Finnish and was still the tourist she&#146;d felt like for her first years in Finland.<br><br>
Joonas opened the door, and Mandy almost startled at the sight of him. Again, he looked paler and thinner than the last time, and his hands were clearly shaking. But his glance didn&#146;t stray when he looked at Mandy.<br><br>
&#148;Come in&#148;, he said.<br><br>
Carefully, Mandy stepped in. She&#146;d originally been unsure of what she&#146;d come for. But even before her eyes had adjusted to the darkness, she saw the white oddity like it was gleaming in the corner, and she stepped to the cage and stayed there, staring into the cage. The inhabitant of the cage looked more alert now than the last time, and it was sitting on its heels, tense, in the middle of the small cage, only moving its head and eyes a little.<br><br>
&#148;What&#146;s its name?&#148; asked Mandy, who now seemed to know that merely seeing this creature made coming here worthwhile. The being&#146;s slender hands were moving some.<br><br>
&#148;I don&#146;t know yet&#148;, said Joonas, &#148;I call her Maria. Maybe she&#146;ll tell me her real name some day.&#148;<br><br>
&#148;Does it talk?&#148;<br><br>
&#148;No. Not to me at least&#148;, he said, and frowned. Mandy was silent for a moment and looked at Joonas, who was now squatting in front of the cage, next to Mandy. She sat down to the concrete floor.<br><br>
&#148;What&#146;s wrong with you?&#148; she asked, like she&#146;d asked less than a month ago, when she&#146;d seen him for the first time in a couple of years.<br><br>
Joonas gave a short laugh. &#148;Maria needs&#148;, he smiled bitterly, &#148;too much blood. It won&#146;t survive on the meat from the store for long.&#148;<br><br>
Mandy looked at him, unbelieving, and didn&#146;t say anything. The whole story was turning so absurd that she was actually ready to accept this, too. She looked at Maria and then back at Joonas.<br><br>
&#148;I just wanted to know&#148;, she said, and couldn&#146;t think of anything more to say. He didn&#146;t seem to notice her when she wasn&#146;t talking. He only looked at the cage and scratched his arms tenderly. There were long scars on his arms, made by a knife or teeth.<br><br>
&#148;Of course, you can&#146;t do this&#148;, said Mandy. &#148;Look at the state of you.&#148;<br><br>
&#148;Yes I can. There&#146;s not much time left until&#148;, he replied and paused, &#148;something will happen.&#148;<br><br>
&#148;What?&#148; she asked. He shrugged.<br><br>
&#148;I don&#146;t know.&#148;<br><br>
She was silent again. She decided to forget about him and looked at Maria, that seemed to be snoozing in its cage, still crouched. Mandy would have wanted to touch it to find out how its skin felt like. She wanted to solve problems that surrounded this oddity, but she felt tired and somehow content. Joonas didn&#146;t apparently know much more about Maria than she did, but she could find out quite much by observing it. She stared into the cage, and Maria&#146;s eyes turned to her. For a moment, their gaze hit her straight into the eyes and then wandered around her squatting body. Mandy was wearing shorts and a tank top and was a little cold in the cellar, but she sat still and watched.<br><br>
She couldn&#146;t quite decide whether Maria was an animal or a human. She just kept looking at it shamelessly, like she&#146;d watch a dog, but its expressions and the way it sat imprisoned, unshaken, seemed human. She looked at it for a while more, and for a moment, the beauty of Maria filled her entire sight, until she woke up and started to look at herself like an adult again.<br><br>
&#148;You can&#146;t do this&#148;, she said, shaking her head. &#148;You must... have it examined. Take it away.&#148;<br><br>
&#148;It can&#146;t be taken away&#148;, Joonas replied from behind her, &#148;would you?&#148;<br><br>
She was sure she wouldn&#146;t. She wouldn&#146;t want that freak of nature to be banished from her world, somewhere far away to be examined, where she could never solve its secret, if it actually had one. She couldn&#146;t but admit he was right even if she knew, at the same time, that she was speaking the truth herself. She couldn&#146;t but go away. Once more, she glanced into the cage, where the freak was looking at her like looking at a friend, and then she went to the door. For a second time already, she opened the cellar door, speechless, and went out to the sunshine. The weather didn&#146;t seem good anymore, but somehow bleak, and she walked home, frowning.<br><br>
<br><br>
In a few days, Mandy had an text message from an unknown number, and the message announced the key to the cellar door was hanging from a hidden peg next to a stockroom door. She thought about replying to the message, but since there had been no proposition or plead in it, she didn&#146;t quite know what to answer. She&#146;d thought about whether she&#146;d ever go to Maria to the cellar room again, but now she could go there any time, even without Joonas. She was on her summer holidays, so she woke up late the next morning, ate a little, tried to clean up the house a little, and finally decided to go and see if she could really get in the cellar.<br><br>
In the place that Joonas had mentioned, there indeed was a peg, where there was hanging a bunch of three keys. The keys said &#148;Cellar&#148;, &#148;Front door&#148;, and &#148;Cage&#148;. Mandy opened the door to the cellar, which was empty except for the cage and its inhabitant. Anyhow, Mandy didn&#146;t even feel strange to go sitting at a safe distance from the cage and just watching Maria. Again, it looked more brisk and even more muscular than before, but she was sure she imagined the latter, because it couldn&#146;t have moved effectively in its cage of a few cubic metres.<br><br>
Maria gnashed its teeth and either smiled or grimaced. Mandy was sure that it was now, for the first time, trying to contact her. It leaped near the bars without rising much from its crouching position and stared straight into Mandy&#146;s eyes. Mandy wanted to touch it. She&#146;d wanted this before, but now her desire to the strange creature seemed insuperable. She was almost trembling when she contemplated her two options. The child didn&#146;t look violent, but she knew about its bloodlust.<br><br>
The child fed on blood. Mandy had believed these words of Joonas without even thinking about it. Now she didn&#146;t know where Joonas was or when he&#146;d return. She started feeling like she had no options. Mandy looked around the room, nervous. The floor was an untidy concrete one and there was dust in the corners. Close to one wall, there were empty boxes and close to another, a lamp that cast a dim light into the room. In the corner next to to the cage, there was a small, white plastic bowl. Mandy looked into the bowl. There was something dried and dark on the bottom of it, maybe blood.<br><br>
Seeing blood got Mandy to her senses again. She could not play the horrible game of Joonas and that oddity. She felt ridiculous again, when she had so quickly taken the fairy tales told to her as truths. She wondered if the whole thing could be just a practical joke or some kind of a sociological test, but she came to the conclusion that it didn&#146;t matter. She kept feeling confused and she wasn&#146;t quite being her own self, if she was spending her time watching Maria. Thus, she had to leave and not come back. This time she didn&#146;t even look in the direction of the cave before walking out.<br><br>
<br><br>
Mandy returned home and tried to collect her thoughts. Should she call the police? Or even Joonas? Or could she just forget about all about Joonas and Maria, and condemn the thing as a strange incident that wasn&#146;t really relevant? Mandy kept thinking about things and wandered restlessly around her house before going to sleep.<br><br>
<br><br>
The next morning Mandy went for a walk. Without even noticing it, she happened to end up to Joonas&#146;s house. She walked around the building to see if she could look inside the cellar room, but it was too dark inside for her to see anything. She wanted to look for Joonas and ask him about things. Besides, she was starting to have the strong feeling that anyhow, she should see Maria once more, just in case something crucial would be revealed about it this time.<br><br>
She went to the cellar room like before. The oddity was staring at her in its cage looking wan and sweet. It was crouching in its usual position, not moving at all. Mandy didn&#146;t know what to do. She sat beside the cage feeling a strange kind of love. She looked at it for a long time, taking careful notice of its features. It seemed fragile and expressionless.<br><br>
Mandy started feeling cold on the floor, so she stood up. She looked around again. It seemed that no one had been in the room since yesterday. She walked to the corner, to the bowl, and picked it up, only feeling slightly repulsed any more.<br><br>
Maria screeched. Mandy looked at it. It was standing up and looked at Mandy&#146;s eyes and the bowl in turn. The child in the cage was white and delicate, and looked suddenly very naked, now that Mandy saw it in another position than crouching for the first time. It seemed to be radiating its own light, and to Mandy, it seemed like it was apart from the aridness of the whole room, alone in its own beauty. Finally, Mandy knew that she wanted to help it.<br><br>
Fast, so that she wouldn&#146;t have the time to stop, she took nail scissors out of her bag and fiercely slashed a short cut across her wrist. She grimaced from pain and dropped the bowl but then picked it up and let the blood from her cut pour into it for a while. Then she took off her white, long-sleeved shirt and bound it tightly around her wound. This was only a small sacrifice to her, And Maria needed her so much that she only felt good.<br><br>
Mandy was still weeping from pain as she held the bowl with her unharmed hand. She looked at Maria, expecting some kind of a reaction of it, and it returned the stare with the same firmness. Carefully, Mandy reached out with the bowl without stepping closer. She pushed the bowl inside the cage between the bars, and finally, Maria gripped it with firm hands. It sniffed the blood and opened its thin, white lips, raised the bowl to them, and drank everything with one sip. Mandy looked at it, enchanted, and at the same time, repulsed. She knew the whole situation was sick and horrible, but she couldn&#146;t stop watching.<br><br>
Maria stopped drinking and looked Mandy in the eyes. A little blood was dripping from the corner of its mouth, and without thinking much, Mandy reached out her arm into the cage and wiped the blood away. Maria didn&#146;t move. Its skin was soft and covered by down, and it was like Mandy&#146;s breathing had quickened when she touched that fascinating mongrel without hostility. When pulling her hand away, a second from the touch, Mandy touched Maria&#146;s hair lightly and then put her hand to her chest.<br><br>
Mandy was sure that a creature that beautiful and calm could not be dangerous at ll. She took the bunch of keys from her bag, picked the key for the cage, and opened the lock.<br><br>
