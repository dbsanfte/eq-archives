<p>"It's been ten years, you know?" Jeff asked quite suddenly after a few long moments of quiet, stepping to one side to let a stream of young children gallop passed, a grin plastering itself onto his thick jawed face. He stood almost at six foot tall, something of a giant within the city, and bald except for a heavy braid left at the nape of his neck to run down his back. Grey eyes followed the last of the children as they spun around a corner; the yipping and giggles vanishing with the last that fled up another street. Looking down a bit towards his friend, he waited for him to give back attention.</p>

<p>A gaze was returned finally after the last of the noise drained away and they were left in somewhat peace, for the two sari were walking down the middle of the market, a slow pace to let others clear out of their way long before they got there. "Ten years? What happened ten years ago that made you say that, Jeff?" The smaller, but muscular one asked, tilting up his head to get a better look of the brute, a puzzled look running deep in his steel blue eyes. Tugging at the collar of his stiff uniform, he paused and held out his hand to stop Jeff from walking any more. "You going to tell me or just look as confused as I am?"</p>

<p>"Of course I'm going to tell you, Darian. Though it'd be more fun if you just found out by surprise, which will probably happen sometime in the afternoon."</p>

<p>"Pardon?"</p>

<p>"The surprise, why I brought up ten years ago." Jeff started his stroll again, for a crowd of people was beginning to form around the two Firsts. Neither of the two saris liked being in the center of attention, though they constantly used the main roads to get places, so it was expected for them to be stopped. But together no one really dared to interfere, thinking that that would mean a night in the cells. A crowd of people with concerns, though, was brave enough to start to look questionably towards them as they picked their way down the road, pausing for yet another moment after some silence.</p>

<p>Darian was not too sure as to what the large one was getting at; a blank was drawing as he tried to remember something important ten years ago. Having no wife or children to worry about, most important dates were that of old fights or meetings that brought about change in the way of living, but nothing to bring up in an idle chat. Letting out a stiff blow of air at a chunk of hair that had slipped free of its bindings, the smaller sari man finally just shook his head in frustration. "Tell me, Jeff."</p>

<p>"Eh, I've got a meeting to get ready for," he stated quickly, a large smirk pulling at the corners of his mouth, catching even a glint of amusement in his dark eyes. "Meet me back at the Commons when you find out."</p>

<p>Darian bristled but kept his hands from swiping out at the Priest, a stiff chuckle of annoyance bursting from his lips. "Damn fool. Now I'll be nagged all afternoon to remember this."</p>

<p>That's the point." And Jeff turned on his heel and walked swiftly through the gathering crowd that had been trailing them, half-vanishing within them except for what foot stuck out over their heads.</p>

<p>Not bothering with following the quickly retreating Priest, Darian shrugged his shoulders and tried to blank his mind of the few moments of odd talk. Now alone, the crowd seemed to lessen, but there were still some younger boys and girls hovering a few yards behind him as he started to stroll off, heading towards the gate out of the city. Those were ones that were slightly interested in becoming prospect students with the Guard. And since he was the leader, the First of the Guard, he had the wonderful joy of the preening younglings almost every day. It was something he could tune out and walk away from, like now, for his mind was currently occupied with trying to remember the past.</p>

<p>The streets grew quiet as the children figured out that he was ignoring them and had tottered off elsewhere. Letting out a long yawn, he stretched his arms out wide then relaxed, hands tucking back in under the folds of his heavy winter's cloak. Autumn here never lasted long; the forests that surrounded the city made it so that northerly winds traveled quick and fiercely into its center where the city lay. A few curled and dried leaves from sidewalk planted trees bustled passed his boots and away down the cobbled road, bare branches shaking as the wind blew a bit more forcefully as the sun was slowly covered up by billowing clouds. Snow was more than likely to start falling soon, covering everything in a freezing blanket of white and blue shadows, and stopping life within the dark walled city for a while. He was looking forward to that, for that would signal the end of the year and the end of searching for fledgling apprentices to the Guards' unit. No more flocks of youngsters at his heels and watching from the corners of their eyes in hopes to catch his fleeting attention. And no more swooning girls to bat their eyelashes at him. Or at least he hoped with that, the winter keeping most but the Guards within homes.</p>

<p>Tired of hoping that it would snow that night, he returned his attentions inward again to trying to remember. Ten years ago was quite a ways back, and he had been just one of those silly fledgling runs dogging after the heels of the now dead First Captain of the Guard, Vanis. But that was all he could really recall that stuck out in the back of his head, being assigned his first duty of watch on a very chilly night, one that would determine if he wanted to stick through this career for the rest of his life. He had survived bristling chills of harsh winds and snow beating against his face, bundled up under a thick coat and some warm soup that had been stolen by a good friend of his, one who had some how surprised the entire city by becoming their First Priest. The ruler in a sense of all the saris within the walls of the city. Jeff had not survived that night at all, and had chickened out after just an hour of keeping watch on the high bridges that ran from tower to tower of the central Temple. Back to the kitchens he had gone and out once more minutes later with a mug of broth to warm Darian's belly. Somewhere on the mission back into the kitchens to sneak away from the freezing guard duty, Jeff must have had gotten intercepted by another Priest. Nothing else seemed to push its way out from his memories but that small moment, perhaps it was just something important to Jeff and not him.</p>

<p>Giving a shrug to himself, he noticed that he was at the gate to the city, the thick bars open to let in the day's traffic of saris from the fields back home. A few of his Guards stood there silently, straightening somewhat when they noted that he was there watching them with a critical eye. Dressed in dark brown, the normal city Guard were those who had given up with being out in the woods, either by wounding or by choice or order from him, and stuck to manning the inner town and the entrance gate. Green were out in the woods with bow and arrows, watching like hawks and swift as a deer to report news from the outer fringes of the forest back to the dead center and his ear. They were the Scouts, the more sought after position for it meant more dangers and 'heroic' actions from time to time. Darian hated it. He was much happier up on the bridges that connected the five towers with one another, five stories of tower and bridges, each with look outs searching the sky and forests for sign of invasion. It was also the spot where he was least bothered by the citizens, whom he did not generally hate, but rather just annoyed by their dull cries of injustice and petty crimes. The Priests handled the people, thankfully. He just had to deal with the elves and the swarms of goblins, not that he'd seen an elf since the last raid five years back. And goblins were easy to handle for they did not hawk back that they were being wrongfully tried, but rather died quickly with an arrow in the eye or a sword in the gut.</p>

<p>Looking over the two Guards, he gave a slight nod of his chin and moved off through the gate, in a mind to take a quick stroll down to meet up with the daily messenger that came out of the woods shortly. Usually the Scout would speak with a Guard at the gate and one of them would bring the report to him. But today, the city people were bothering him so he sought the relative silence of the outside. They were overly talkative and pestering and it was driving him insane with being caught up in the crowds. Jeff could handle them, and Darian was quite glad that he had him along on some of his walks through the market place to keep the crowd back. Two Firsts were nerve racking for the normal citizen, as if they were unsure how to approach two people of power.</p>

<p>He quickened his pace to nearly a jog when a smacking of freezing wind hit his body from the north, sending a few moments of chills running from head to toe and back up again. Shaking off the numbness in his face, he forced his legs to carry him along the granite road towards the crying angel statue. That bit of rock disturbed him, and every other sari in the city, jolting memories of the murder that started the breaking of the bond between the two most powerful races one the eastern half of the world. Averting his eyes as he drew nearer, looking off towards the distant forest he spotted a lone figure and a horse just emerging from the woods.</p>

<p>Nearly dropping his mouth wide open, he came to a tumbling halt right at the side of the statue and jumped back quickly, reflexes tight to years of training with the best Guards in the last century. Muttering some under his breath as he was forced to hide behind the dreaded statue, he quickly peeked around to see if the stranger had seen him. The small form was still just standing there, looking up at the sky, something that that person had not seen in quite some time for the forest had the strange ability to block out all light from hitting the ground. It was a savior, that trick of the living forest, for it kept away the other hostile races that sought out this hidden city, though it failed to keep out the small creatures, like the greedy goblins.</p>

<p>Watching the form as it just stood there in awe, he suddenly was hit with a thought. None of the Scouts had come to report a trespasser. Strange. Shaking his head, he squinted his eyes as if that would allow him to see a greater distance, but for naught. Still a blur and still not daring to move closer, he could not make out the person. If no one had come to warn him, then that meant either the messenger Scout was murdered and laying in the forest, or it was a lost sari and there had been no reason to quicken the delivery of the reports.</p>

<p>Or this one had managed to pass undetected through the forest.</p>

<p>But then, as he stayed back and watched from his hiding spot, the stranger looked back towards the forest, as if deciding if they should go back in and find their way to the beginning. In that moment, a Scout seemed to just materialized at the back of the person, stepping from the forest's edge in which he had been waiting in the shadows, a sword drawn and brought to the waist in warning. Apparently the messenger had not been killed, for that was he and so had just delayed his trip back to the city to wait for the stranger to clear the forest and arrest. He watched the other freeze and not dare to even look around as if they knew who was there already, the Scout grabbing for an arm and threatening even more with a dare to run the sword through the body. Making not a move, the captured one let the Scout lead them away from the overburdened horse, who then followed like a dog after its master.</p>

<p>Not waiting to be caught in hiding, he stepped around the angel and made his way off towards the Scout and prisoner, seeming as if he had just decided to take a respectful look at the statue. With both of them moving down the road towards one another hastily, it was not long before he saw that the stranger was female and covered in grim and blood as well. Red hair, the color of wild flames was tied back in a thick braid, though clumps had been freed by probably running into the many bramble bushes along the way through the forest. It framed her paled, and mud smeared face, sticking with dirt and appearing like streaks of dried blood. She was, as he drew even closer so that he could see that she was armed as well, struggling to rip herself free after glancing up with startled gold eyes towards Darian, spotting him. Outnumbered, she had grown a bit frantic as if just realizing she was trapped.</p>

<p>Annoyed that this slight woman had somehow managed to sneak passed all his Scouts and various traps, and knew of the way through, he snarled softly once just a few feet from her. Lifting his hand, which she of course tried to smack away as he reached for his face, he snapped out a vicious order with a growling voice. "Stand still, wench!"</p>

<p>Surprisingly, she obeyed with a bite on her tongue to keep from snapping back at him, her eyes narrowed with anger, but smart enough to realize that she would probably not win any fights she started. Her gold eyes frantically followed his hand as he reached forward again for her hair, yanking it free of her face and managing to draw back with a few snapped strands. Clearing up one side so that he could see properly, he let out another choked noise and stepped back, a curious look given towards the other sari Guard. That one glanced at her ear as well and jerked his hand off her upper arm as if she had suddenly become the fire her hair was suggesting she could be. The two men looked at each other, then back at her again, almost in shocked awe. They both recognized her, and she noted the looks as well and seemed to just want to shrink into her fur-lined cloak, fingers clutching it tightly around her slender body.</p>

<p>In the back of Darian's head a memory stirred that had been buried away with shame and anger and guilt. After a moment of just studying her with an almost feared look, a name came to the tip of his tongue. "Mialyn?"</p>
