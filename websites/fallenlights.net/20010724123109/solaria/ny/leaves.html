It was made from the magiks wielded by ancient creatures now but all extinct.  Created out of mere whim one sunny afternoon, created out of sheer boredom by ones that had too much time and power within their grasp.  Only a few remained to tend to this Creation.  An odd way to have the history of the world live within the creation, one which rested near a mountain to the north of the human's continually pushing boundaries.  Years passed unwitnessed, never known to the trees that stood guard to this pale world, some passing without a minute detail of change.  No foot of a weary traveler would wander into this world, paths would always shy away as if on their own will, not wanting to disturb the clearing.
<BR><br>Far outside any known border of any known city was a giant clearing miles in diameter, stretching over gullies and rolling hills covered with waves of tall grass spanning the entire land, only broken by a cluster of saplings here and there.  Woods of twisted pine and withered oak ages old played with the edge of this near perfect circle, denying it from the mere eyes of a short lived one.  A creature that could never witness such a place.  Bark all of silver hue, gnarled and imperfect, each of these trees that rooted within the clearing read of ancient times, of watching wars upon wars, civilizations falling to rubble.  No one knew how to read this history, the language of the tree being far different then anything in existence, it was to be felt by the senses.  Leaves shook with age old horror, slapping each other loudly as the wind jostled by.  Leaves screamed out silently of stories that came to pass and those that would be.  Leaves freed themselves from the clutches of the branches and fluttered to the ground, and as they did so, the remembered the deaths of those past and those to come.  Each was a book, each read themselves out to the world that seemed not to care enough to listen.  The wind knew, as did the grass and the deer that daintily tasted the leaves as they gave their knowledge.  Though, no mortal knew that the trees were the weavers of their lives.
<BR><br>The air was of peace one freezing eve, a humming continuously waxing and waning in sound, building from a calmed excitement, then dying off to the merest, frightened whisper.  A drifting note lingered there, waiting for the next rise in sound, hovering just within hearing.  Night had fallen and the sounds mixed with the shrilling crickets' dancing songs, owls' wings slapping through the finally stilled air as they made a sweep to look for mice, and the off in the distance noise of a troop of heavy footed warhorses plodding onward.  The humming had lifted to the stars that broke past the fine mist of clouds, shivering and pulsing with a dance to the tuneless tremor.
<BR><br>She dared to never let traveler enter, fearing for her life, knowing from the leaves of what these mortals did.  She, who stood silently at the edge of the clearing, looking in at the starlight grass with soul filled eyes of the clearest gold, knew the language of the history.  She heard the whispering between the air and the deer nibbling upon roots and the jostling leaves.  The wails and the shivers of fear shook her down to the marrow of her frail bones.  She alone had sought out this history that passed and was to come, and now was frightened.  Not knowing what to do with this jumbled up information that swept quickly into Her thoughts and back out again, racing on with its conversation.  She who guarded this delicate world by dusk-fall, was now at a loss of words, the air was different this one, misty night.  Something had happened that was out of place, either by time or by land.  But something in the history of what would happen, years from now or lands other then where it had happened, was wrong, wind picking up as it too heard the leaves scream this out.  And so the trees continued to talk in their own language, trying to sort out exactly what had just went wrong with their stories.  She was still looking into the vast clearing, eyes not really seeing what was there, unable to focus as she felt the pain coming out of the land.
<BR><br>It was in there.  In the clearing itself was where that that something fell apart, something that should not have been in this time, not in this land.  And She refused to enter to see what was causing the screams.  It was not Her place to change the mistakes of the histories, they would eventually find the right path of words again, and continue on as if all was well.  She was just a watcher, one that saw what happened, She saw all that made the mortals do as they did, she saw the stories become history.  She was one of the Creators.
<BR><br>She was scared.
<BR><br>The gold eyes were still turned inward, watching the strangeness finally manifest itself into a form, a glowing aura that slowly seeped out from the center of the vast clearing.  Now it was really happening, before it was just a feeling that there was a wrongness, but now . . . now She began to see exactly what made the aching in the land so harsh.
<BR><br>Not of Her kind, not a true creature born out of the dirt, the Fae that dwelt within the clearing were stirring.  She watched over these Faerie children, as did the Other who guarded during the hours when the stars were sleeping.  She knew them well, for they were almost like Herself.  Almost, for they were not born out of the earth, but from each other, as all other creatures of this world were created.  There were many, where She was only one.
