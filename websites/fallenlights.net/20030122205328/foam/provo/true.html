And besides, I believe (without any list of sources, just based on my own experience) that the differences between human _individuals_, even members of the same sex, are greater than the differences between the average man and the average woman. (Click <A HREF="gender.html">here</A> to find out the difference between sexes and genders, or men and males.)</P><P align=justify>It&#146;s not liberating that everyone must be alike. It&#146;s often said that the problem about the opinions of feminists and supporters of the equality of the genders is that they think everyone should be identical, even if, in reality, there are differences between people (and the sexes). But true equality is really the right of everyone to act like they want to, and differently in different situations, if they want to: somebody could, in the ideal world, be, for example, an alpha male at work, a mother to eir <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">*</FONT>) baby, a good husband to eir partner and a bitch in bed <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">**</FONT>). The real equality between the genders wouldn&#146;t be everyone trying to be alike, sexless (yes, I am androgynous and bisexual, but you won&#146;t have to be), but everyone being permitted to be what they feel like being. I don&#146;t stand for removing genders but adding many, many more genders to the repertoire from which everyone could be able to choose (regardless of what happens to be between their legs).</P><P align=justify>Now I can hear someone saying &#148;but people have a natural need to divide into two. Nobody can make people think that everyone is equal. There will never be a world where they wouldn&#146;t have prejudices based on e.g. people&#146;s gender.&#148; But my point is this: yes, people have the natural, psychological need to label each other. But why couldn&#146;t there be much more labels? For example, zodiac signs and the four types of people of the antiquity (melancholic, sanguine, choleric and what&#146;s the fourth one?) are examples of people&#146;s capability of dividing into more than two. The new genders could be, say, the nurse, the model, the builder, the leader, the protector, the tranquil worker, the teacher and so on.</P><P align=justify>The thing that&#146;s humiliating is to think that women would always want to aim at being on &#148;men&#146;s level&#148;, i.e. not to wear make-up, to compete, to be uncompromising, to use large quantities of alcohol and so on. That&#146;s what the society here is aiming at. But the real equality isn&#146;t everyone&#146;s right to act like a &#148;man&#148; (the quotes are there, because it&#146;s impossible for anyone to really be exactly like the man&#146;s archetype). Instead, I&#146;d like to encourage everyone to also try to obtain some of the traditionally &#148;female&#148; virtues, like being kind, humble and compromising and &#8211; if one feels like it &#8211; even sacrificing much time to look after one&#146;s looks.</P><P align=justify>Women&#146;s rights weren&#146;t worse than men&#146;s rights in, say, the Middle Ages. It could as well have been the men who started claiming their rights. The position of the women of the Middle Ages seems bad and that of the men seems good to the people of today just because we&#146;ve learned to appreciate the very things those women were missing: the freedom to be active in the society, the freedom to move, a job outside one&#146;s home and the right to decide whom to marry and whether or not to have babies. But in reality, a man was just as much forced to be outside the home, to work and to maintain one&#146;s family. Then, in the 18th century, the Age of Enlightenment,  a new idea caught on with the people of Europe: a citizen should be able to change the country, when before, the country (or the king) had only commanded the citizens. That&#146;s when being active in the society became important and appreciated. Suddenly the men&#146;s branch of life was _better_ than the women&#146;s. If the women&#146;s branch of life would somehow have been made better than the men&#146;s, the men would have started to claim rights sooner or later: the right to be at home, the right to take care of children. The problem of the modern Finland wouldn&#146;t be the lack of teachers and nurses, but the lack of architects and politicians. That didn&#146;t happen, anyhow, and nowadays everyone thinks it&#146;s a bad thing to &#148;have to&#148; e.g. stay home and take care of the children.</P><P align=justify>This doesn&#146;t mean the Women&#146;s Lib movement wouldn&#146;t have been right about a lot of things. The women&#146;s rights had (or have) to become equal to the men&#146;s rights, just because taking care of babies doesn&#146;t suit every woman. Just like constantly striving forward doesn&#146;t suit every man. But how could we give men, too, equal rights with women?</P><P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><P align=justify>&nbsp;</P>___________<P align=justify>&nbsp;</P><P align=justify><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">*</FONT>) Yes, it was a gender-neutral pronoun.

I don&#146;t think it&#146;s been translated into English, even though it should be. It contains rather radical thoughts about genders and sexes, a clever and funny book that&#146;s also easy to read (well, at least if you read Finnish), and not too academical.</P><br>        <br><BR><script type="text/javascript" language="JavaScript"> sw="none";sd="none";ref=""+escape(document.referrer); </script> <script type="text/javascript"language="JavaScript1.2"> sw=screen.width;nav=navigator.appName;sc=(nav!="Netscape")?screen.colorDepth:screen.pixelDepth; </script> <script type="text/javascript" language="JavaScript"> function doit(str) {document.writeln(str);}qs="&sw="+sw+"&sc="+sc+"&ref="+ref; url='http://counter4.bravenet.com/index.php?'; url +='id=340041&usernum=284702383&cpv=1';curl='http://counter4.bravenet.com/counter.php?id=340041&usernum=284702383'; doit('<a href="'+url+'" target="_top"><img width="1" height="1" border="0" src="'+curl+qs+'" /></a>') </script> <noscript> <a href="http://counter4.bravenet.com/index.php?id=340041&usernum=284702383&cpv=1" target="_top"><img src="http://counter4.bravenet.com/counter.php?id=340041&usernum=284702383" alt="Bravenet.com" border="0" /></a> </noscript><BR><BR><BR><BR> <BLOCKQUOTE>  <BLOCKQUOTE>| <a href=# onClick="window.close();">close window</a> |            </BLOCKQUOTE>  </BLOCKQUOTE></font></td></tr></table></body></HTML>
