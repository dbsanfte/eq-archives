<br>Chelta Geverai - Before the Inn<br>

<div align=justify>
<p>An ebon shaded hand lifted gingerly to wipe the formation of a dripping globule of blood from under her forehead, slowly enough that it missed the first drip of thick, red liquid seeping into her silver brow.  Her brows furrowed together at the teasing trickle, but her fingers moped up the blood before it streaked down further.  She looked up at the branch and just frowned, lips taunt and empty of any color, pure black for once, instead of the soft shade of deep blue, like the starless sky of her former homeland in the caves.  Stepping from the line of forest edge, the dark elf looked over the field slowly, eyes making a quick, calculating scan of the land surrounding the small village nestled back into the forest on the opposite side from where she stood.  One hand dropped as her other lifted, and both straightened the collar to her long, sweeping coat, fixing it so that her neck was hidden behind the black fabric.  Then slide her hands down to un-button the coat from her traveling through the thick brush, revealing her clothing underneath, all varying shades of darkness.  A vest of midnight skies formed over her body tightly, almost a second skin; as did her pants of brushed leather that tucked into her knee-high boots of beaten black leather.  Strapped to her thick belt were a few slightly curved daggers in plain scabbards.  No need for gaudiness when all you wished was to hid from others.  But, strapped to her back was a three foot staff of pressurized wood, varnished till it was almost a void when looked upon.  The shortness of this otherwise useless toothpick was off-set by the fact that two blades--both a half a foot in length--were lashed to both ends of the staff. Something, that when whirled at her side by quick fingers, was bitting enough to shred her opponent in moments.  One could not simply wield a bladed staff that was of normal six foot length, he would hurt himself.<br />
<BR><br>Amber, though slightly reddish, eyes shifted to her left at the sound of brush moving, a slight hiss of air pushed from her parted lips at the thought of something or someone following her.  Jumpy as anything, she muttered sharply into her mind.  Unconsciously she set a chill spell around herself with a muttering word, hiding her heat waves from prying eyes, if any were even there.  Damn this land, she looked up quietly, and searched the shadows all around, but found nothing to give answers to the sound her sharp ears picked up a moment earlier.  Nothing even so much as twitched from the wind that gusted around the maze set up by the branches of closely knit oaks.  "Most definitely a fae forest," she murmured under her breath as she stepped out and turned on her heel to look back into the dense forest.  Quiet and serene, the trees merely stood there, nothing burst from the shadows to kill or maim her as she thought would happen.  It was moss covered, rocks strewn at the base of the trunks, just now beginning to shimmer as the moon's dew dropped over their surfaces, everything beginning to shimmer like a glamour had been cast on the area.  "Fae definitely," she chuckled faintly and took one step back, drawing her staff with a twitch of her finely boned hand; one that should not have been associated with weaponry, but of sewing or instruments or any other noble lady's doings.  Eyes rose to the fall of the shadow and whispered a few hissing words off her tongue and stepped back once again.  "You here?"<br />
<BR><br>"Of course, my dear," he muttered as the darkness left his face.  The other elf looked down at her, a faint smirk crossing over his blackened lips, moonlight blue on his features, all chiseled to finery of yet one of nobility.  But then, he was of fae blood, and that was the trend of the kin, cattish and perfect.  He bowed his head slightly, long silver hair slipping from it's grasp behind his pointed ear.  Swinging from the branches he had perched upon, the male dropped down soundlessly, thick soled boots suited for the travel over dried leaves and branches.  He had the look of a woodman or traveler, hewed smoothly, but with a faint hint of roguishness to his gait.  "There be magic about tonight, lovely little darkling."<br />
<BR><br>She spat at him, amber eyes fully flickering to that of blood, "I know that.  After all, I'd had the ill chance of stumbling past and through your trap just moments before you decided to finally show yourself."  The touch of her nail to the cut on her brow started it dripping again, warmth finding a slow path down the dried blood.  "I be requiring a name."<br />
<BR><br>"Nae, my child, not now," his voice hit her clearly, though the distance between them was that of straining cords.  "Perchance a drink at the inn of the nearest village?"<br />
<BR><br>"If you mean that one just over my shoulder," she added a breath later, catching onto his thoughts.  "Then you best be attempting another way to be calming my temper tonight."<br />
<BR><br>"As in what way, o'daughter of night?" he chuckled the jibe off the tip of his tongue and took a few strides forward, cloak barely gliding around his broad shoulders.  Again she found that this stillness of his sound un-nerving and trust-less.  Eyes narrowed as she watched him move closer, weaving slightly around the dried leaves of the new season.  His held hers as well, ones of crystal clear blue, like that of the morning sky just before the peeking of the dreadful sun over the tops of the mountains.  "As in a dance perhaps?"<br />
<BR><br>She hoped her eyes did not light up at that idea, one that she would enjoy emmensly, but apparently she betrayed her hopes with one glimmer of light in the depths of her eyes.  He said before she got a chance in, "ah, yes I see.  That pleased you then.  Very well, shall we begin?  Here?"<br />
<BR><br>The whirl of her staff was his answer.  It spun at her fingers' commands, easily cutting the air with a whistling hiss of anticipation of cutting into the soft flesh of a fae boy.  Blurringly, she did not even give him a chance to register her answer, but leapt forward, toes of her boots digging into the earth as she hoped her blades would dig into him.  The whirling staff came down hard, aimed for the curve of his neck.<br />
<BR><br>She found herself stumbling back with a simple knock of his blade.  Looking up dizzily, she wondered with insane hatred on how he managed to draw his blade even from a surprise attack.  The flat of his blade came down over her arm, slapping her to the right.  Hissing from behind a veil of white hair, as she tilted her face towards him, she righted herself with a few jumps backwards, ending her embarrassing spill.<br />
<BR><br>His attack came as she straightened, and it was her turn to block the tip of his black blade before it slipped under her skin to cut at the arteries and spill her life into her hands.  The motion of her constantly moving staff sent his cut askew and she grinned impishly as he sidestepped, swinging the sword back in front of him to get a cut at her advancement.  The two weapons collided, yet neither backed off from the other, holding steady.  She gripped her staff with both hands and pushed hard, but he had the weight and strength her slender self lacked, so her attempt at leading him to a stumble backwards failed.  The two weapons formed an X, she growling at him between the hold, him just looking amused and cocky as any male did when they believed that the opponent's attempts were just an annoying amusement.  So she lunged forward again, but only her lower self--waist and higher were held in lock with his slight push of weight--and the motion sent her knee straight into his groin.<br />
<BR><br>He doubled up, and slackened on press of his sword, which dropped to his feet as he curled up on the slightly dampened ground.  Glazed eyes lifted to hers as she bent over besides him and plucked the sword from the ground and slide it into the empty sheath strapped to her back.  With a chuckle deep in her thought she informed him, "males just have too many weaknesses."  She knelt besides him, a slim cord appearing in her grasp, and leaned closer to him, enough for him to feel her breath run over the delicate hairs on his ear, she then whispered, "your name, elf-boy?"<br />
<BR><br>"What's yours?" he grumbled as he remained still, not even attempting to see if he could free himself.<br />
<BR><br>She pursed her lips and looked him over slowly, as if contemplating if he was worth such an honor.  "Chelta Geverai of the Last House of Dar'keep."  The smirk on her lips pulled taunter as a look of shock masked his face.  "Your name, elf-boy, or that's the one you'll be keeping."<br />
<BR><br>"Thereon Lokere," he murmured as he dropped his gaze.<br />
<BR><br>She patted his head as she stood, brushing her hands off on the sides of her pants.  "Good, I'll be seeing you around then, Thereon."  And she turned away, striding down the silvered path towards the village, completely forgetting that she had left him there whimpering.  As if she really cared that he was there, alone in his natural habitat.<br />
