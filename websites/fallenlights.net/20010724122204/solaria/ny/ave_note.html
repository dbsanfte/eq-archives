<p align=justify>What is up is the first chapter to my third attempt at writing a novel.  It's being rewritten, though I don't foresee anything new being stuck up here for a while--It takes a while to get back into a story that has to be gutted, chewed and spit out (the majority written in 1996-97, which was a very different style of writing for me).  I do have about 200 ++ pages to this that I have to rework.
<br><br>Sometime soon (hopefully) I'll stick up better explinations about the races/etc, for now, this is all you need to know. 
<br><br>Elves = typical fantasy elves you see in most other places, tall and fragile, lovers of magic that messes up the balance of the world.  Currently quite pissed off at the human race, the queen is attempting to gain back the saris under her rule.
<br><br>Sari = similar to the elves, though a bit smaller and built more--though not as much as humans.  They had used to be 'friends' as in living in the elven cities, but then some minor riots broke out and the sari eventually moved themselves out of the elven communities.  They are currently quite pissed off at the elves.  They have no magic, but have the army of the nations.
<br><br>Humans = The king just wants to rule the world.  Enough said about that.  No magic, small but growing army, and one very world-domineering minded leader that wants to kill off the other species or set them into slavery.
<br><br>Three sisters = Three witches.  No one is very sure of what race they are, though most believe they are of elven stock.  Names: Rennin, Xannes, and Tannai.
<br><br>Jangol = Magic, back during a war in the recent past screwed up the blood of a few elves and sari, making this race.  Think of vampires, but not ones that feed off of blood, but rather emotions.  Some are good, some are evil and most are under the guiding hands of the three sisters.
<br><br>Shifters = Souls of elves stolen by the King's First Priest, and converted into something that can 'eat' others.  Meaning the evil soul enters another's body and controls it.
<br><br>Firsts = Top notches of political, religious, or military.  ie: First Captain (there is only ONE in the nation, and then under him, there is a First Lieutenant for each of the Sari cities). First Priest : One for each of the Sari cities.  First King: What most people title the human king.  First Moon: the first night of the month.
<br><br>Religion = Most of all the populations within this world believe in a goddess of the moon, humans though have created the sunking.  there are few, if any other dieties that are spoken of.
<br><br>Hierarchy of all major rulers = First Wizard/ess(elves) and First Queen(elves) are of equal standing, First King(human), First Captain(sari), First Priests(sari)
