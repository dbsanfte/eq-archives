<br>
<br>Dreaming<br>

<br>

<p>The moon hung low in the sky, heavy and fully round. Two others lay hovering higher in the sky, both pale in color but glowing with their own light. In the history they were brother and sister to the larger one that lay just above the tips of the mountain peaks. That one, the giant of the three moons, was the one that represented the Goddess. Nameless and always depicted with a fine porcelain mask hiding her face, sheer gauze wrapping her frail body. They floated around the world lazily, chasing each other in some kind of boring dance.</p>

<p>She stood in a field toned blue, grass gently rubbing up against her bare calf, her skirts pulled high so that when she started walking again, she was not burdened with taking small steps. Hands clutched tightly to the heavy fabric, eyes of gold lifted to observe the silent trio as they arched over head, blotting out the stars with their soft light. She felt as if they were looking back at her, studying her as she contemplated where they came from. For the while, she couldn't quite remember just why the Goddess and her two children were moons, it had been a few years since the last time she had bothered to look through some old, dusty books. Her thin lips pursed and she let her layers of skirts drop to crush the grass, wiggling her toes in her sandals as she let herself look away from them. Towards the mountains she then turned her wary gaze, as if looking to see if something was to come from there. Behind was only a forest, nothing of danger was lurking within its nighttime darkness. But there? In the high peaks of black, violet rock and dead grass was something she could worry about.</p>

<p>Sucking the cool night's air into her lungs, she squinted her eyes to try and see a bit clearer, try to see beyond the foothills and the mountains. But, she did not have that power yet, not one she would have till she was much, much older and wiser. Her face became a look of annoyance at that realization and she pulled her gaze off to her right, looking across the empty pasture of tall, blue toned grass, looking out at the horizon. There was a danger that was as well. Humans lived that way, a living disease spreading rapidly under the hand of a greedy king. She couldn't remember his name so her look slid to the left. That was the sea. The quiet, rolling waves of a sea that she had never seen any closer then this point. No reason to travel there.</p>

<p>So before her and to her right were the troubles. Those to the right were the troubles caused by one man. Easily dealt with when the powers of the army became stronger, they just had to wait. Only the Queen had to worry about that problem, for if she waited too long, the army would dissolve under her fingertips as it had done near a century ago. She shook her head quickly to throw away those thoughts of history, no need to worry about something that's problems were no dangerous.</p>

<p>It was what was in the mountains that caused her heart to thump just a bit more with fear.</p>

<p>Before? That was her people's fault. She had seen the start of those problems, still somewhat unknown to even herself, but known well to others of her powers. The older one that trained her spoke of many time of some things that dwelt within those mountains, growing, plotting, planning just as the humans did. But, unlike the humans, anything that came within their touch was not converted into the way of their kind. It was converted into something that had no mind of its own, no way of freeing themselves once within their grasp. Or so she thought, as did others.</p>

<p>The problem with what was before was that an entirely new breed of creatures had been born out of their magic. They were the fault that had brought these ... what were they called? She mused for a moment, dropping her gaze to her hands. "Jangol."</p>

<p>Frowning softly she rolled the name over on her tongue as she listened to it be carried away on the wind for she had spoken it out loud. Her eyes looked back to the mountains, unable to force herself to take another step in that direction.</p>

<p>Dezrid had told her to leave them alone. Let the Queen handle the problem. But that had been spoken years back and the Queen was still fusing over the humans to her right.</p>

<p>For a moment, she felt as if she was at the center of the world.</p>

<p>Everything was around her, she the one making the choice with where to go. She could go back to the forest where the army waited quietly in their camps, she having wandered off without letting them know of her travels. She could go to the right and force the king into heeding the ideals of her people and creating a peace that would last till the armies could advance and take over with power. To the left was the end of the world, no one knew what was out there in those oceans, some thought that there was nothing at all, just space.</p>

<p>Or she could go forward. But, Dezrid had said to leave the Jangol be, that there weren't that many of them and they were of no harm to a much more vast colony of peoples. They would be squashed like flies if they dared to try anything outside of their rocky prison. Dezrid did not know that the Sisters were in there as well; he thought they were dead.</p>

<p>Her eyes blurred and she did not see the world for a moment, the feeling of her being at the center having faded with her thoughts of stretching ahead. She closed her eyes and waited for a Dreaming to wash over her body like freezing rain. The softness of a deep sleep quickly came close to her as she called for it, standing in the middle of the blue toned field. A gentle touch like that of a mother's hand over the brow of a newborn child.</p>

<p>A smack to her cheek as the incoming Dreaming was suddenly yanked back out of her grasp, sending her toppling backwards onto her rear, crushing the grass below her body. Gasping in a rush of cool air, she snapped her eyes open and stared straight ahead, expecting to see someone their blocking her powers. Her lungs burned with the air and she exhaled, realizing that she had been holding her breath. Her gold eyes narrowed sharply as she thought she saw a lone figure standing just at the start of what seemed to be a path of crushed grass. But she blinked and the vision was gone and she was alone again, standing with her hands gripping her skirts so that she could walk quickly without having to take...</p>

<p>She shook her head hard and looked down at her sandal covered feet, then back at the moons. The large one was fully gone, hours having had past instead of the few moments that she had thought. Her pale, thin lips pulled down into a thoughtful frown as she glanced up, noting that the brother and sister moons had moved as well, now closer to the peaks of the black mountains. It dawned on her, as it always did when she was being drawn out of a Dreaming not brought about by her own will, but unconsciously.</p>

<p>There was no need to Dream of the future. She had been all this time when she had first laid eyes on the Goddess's moon.</p>

<p>Her reasons for abandoning the camp were completed. Her answer firmly planted in her head and she knew where she had to lead those that followed her. Dropping her skirts because the blue toned grass that brushed over her bared calves were damp with the morning's dew, she looked once more at the mountains that held the danger, suddenly not caring what Dezrid had spoken to her.</p>

<p>She had seen the Jangol, had felt one try to drain her of her energy and magic. She knew what they wanted from her, what they wanted from the Queen, and then later the king. Tilting her chin up high as it was right for the First Wizardess to look like she was of noble birth---her one and only secret she had left in her chest--she strode off back towards the forests. Back to where the army was beginning to stir in camp as the morning dawned on them.</p>

<p>Shaking her head as she passed through the wet grass, she tried hard to think back to when she had fell into the Dreaming but as like all the other times that the Dream had come without her wanting, that thought would only give her a headache. </p>
