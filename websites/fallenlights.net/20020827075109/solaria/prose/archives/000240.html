World comes crashing<br>

<p>Everyone must think of killing themselves at least once in their life, right? She can understand some of those people, when she can't trust even the closest one to her heart anymore. Everything shatters, the world is pointless, her life means nothing to anyone.</p>

<p>Love means absolute shit. It's just a word to explain a rush in the brain and heart and belly. Then it fizzles and pops after so, so, so long of using that word. Or maybe she thinks that world should just be perfect, the one man can love just one woman physically and mentally. At least, she knows SHE can. As for the man? Who knows any more.</p>

<p>Tears are common, they've always been common. Just another emotion for her to use because she doesn't understand. People are cruel, she is sometimes, but feels like she was punched in the stomach later on. Little words can hurt someone, the ones called over-sensative, the ones that were cry-babies all their life, even up till their adulthood years. Things get better, then they get worse.</p>

<p>Right now, she feels as if she's just another piece of meat to be moulded and played with till set aside, the hands of the user bored with trying to help her break down her walls that were put up there to keep tears at bay. The one person that could start pulling down the bricks the lifes problems had firmly implanted in her mind.</p>

<p>That one person just built every single one of them back in place with mortor so strong that it may take the rest of her life for a crack to begin to grow.</p>

<p>Apparently she's not good enough.</p>

<p>And apparently she can't trust anyone. Ever. <br />
