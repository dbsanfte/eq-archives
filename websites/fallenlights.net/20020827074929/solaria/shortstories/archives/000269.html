Chelta Geverai - Leaving<br>

<p>It had been while resting back in his arms, her eyes fixated upon the black skinned, grey haired baby that should have only been two months of age, squirming and mewling for milk, not stammering over her first words, when she remembered. He seemed to not have noted her sudden stillness, eyes still staring down at the girl who watched up at her parents, for the arms around her waist did not stiffen when she sucked in a soft gasp of breath. Elryndra--the babe of the drowess and her mate, the sylvan Xsax'vser--noted the change in her mother's face, one that hardened with faint annoyance. The look down to the child suddenly flickered with a light to hush the girl from pointing this out, and without further interruption, she curled up against the breast of the drowess and promptly feel asleep. The curse on the child's growth was getting under her skin once more, and she had to figure a way to remove it. Which was when she had remembered.<br />
   <br><br><br />
This had been a few nights back, and the memories were still strong in Chelta's mind, thinking over the possibilities of such a scroll, wondering just how she had failed to recall her priestess knowledge when she had been with child. Back when she was in the over grown forests that hedged in around her birth place, back where it had been toppled to the ground years earlier was a scroll laying hidden in a power protected chest, hopefully buried from any prying fingers that had come after her with plans of removing items. So thinking of these times, her fingers were busy yanking strings closed and knotted tightly after making sure the necessities were all accounted for. Distress over the strain that her child might soon be feeling was making her move quickly, fidgeting with the hem of her fur lined cloak that was bound at her throat, and playing with the knots and buckles over and over til she was absolutely certain that nothing would come undone.<br />
   <br><br><br />
She just could not understand how this had not hit her the same day the curse had started, though, then again, her mind was already slipping away from her grasp, lost to insanity. Frantic, she glanced out around the room, dimly lit with turned down oil-lamps, curtains drawn tight to keep all light out, and empty, not a soul hovering in the other room humming softly to the child that was not there at the moment. She looked over her other shoulder, past the fur of her cowl, eyes falling on the mirror there. Seeing herself, gaunt and slightly toned red, ebon skin from the small amount light, she blinked her hazy red eyes. Age had begun to settle in on her ageless face, faint lines playing at the corners of her slanted, almond eyes, a blackening to her ghost white hair that yet again had been snipped short to her scalp. Other then that, small details that she would only notice, she just appeared to have thinned out over her frame, her leather clothes not as constricting as they once had been. Gruffing out a small growl, her hand grabbed for the parchment that had been resting quietly besides her sack, wrinkling it in her palm and just dropped it quickly, so that she did not have to see the disturbing sight of her age flickering past her emotionlessness face. It was just a hurried slip of paper that had her scrawling handwriting upon it, explaining her sudden disappearance. Hopefully, this crinkled bit of paper would be found when she was gone, long, long gone from the cursed inn.<br />
   <br><br><br />
Yanking the sack's straps over her shoulders, tugging out the bunched up cloak, she stepped lightly from the room, letting the door click faintly behind her, latching itself tight. Down the stairs she went, eyes always darting about over the slowly appearing faces as she emerged out into the common's room, her hand pulling the cowl up over her face, hiding its aged  looks within shadows. Not one person paid her any heed, for now she was a frequent guest, slipping around the tables, avoiding the patrons' feet as she crossed the thickly planked floor to the door on the opposite side.  The bond she had with her mate was not triggered, she did not sense his life mingling with the patrons that were wandering to and fro, nor did she spot the Nurse that had been watching over Elryndra. Perhaps it was a good thing that neither were there to halt her traveling plans.<br />
   <br><br><br />
The soft clicking of her spike-heeled, knee high boots were the only sound of her passing over the room, hips swaying as she rounded herself past dinning patrons. Giving herself a downward glance, counting out her daggers that were visible, her hand closed in around the handle and she drew in a deep breath. This was going to hurt. The moon was full outside,the snow glittering the light brighter then the noon day sun, and she, a creature that was blinded by a small flickering flame of a candle had to walk leagues through it. Lungs stinging with inhaled air, she tugged the sticky, oak door wide and stepped forth onto the steps, her eyes automatically closing on her, bloody tears of burst capillaries spilling down over her cheeks.  Smearing the blood from her eyes, she forced herself to look straight at the moon.<br />
   <br><br><br />
Ages past with her just standing there.<br />
   <br><br><br />
Shuddering with pain in her head and down her stiffened spine, she had forced herself to become used to the light she was terrorized of. Her mind, within the pain of the burnings, slipped slightly back into what it used to be, living into the memories. But, she was just seeing the most recent, her hand scrawling out over a bit of worn, fray-edged paper, writing Xsax the letter of her disappearance.   <br />
   <br><br><br />
<i>Dearest. . . love</i>, it had started--the ink probably now dried, some smearing from when she had crushed it in her palm--and continued on hesitantly,<br />
<i>I couldn't . . . let you know of my travels, fearing others that I assume still watch over me, being the sole survivor and cause of the fall of my House. I should. . . .</i> This was where her hand really trembled, the pen letting blots fall as it rolled off the tabletop and shattering on the floor. She remembered this as she stood there out in the cold, her eyes painfully lifted up to the rising moon, tears of blood dripping over her cheeks, and collecting at the point of her chin. There were bits of pink snow at her feet. Again she slipped back into the past, remembering when she had meet Death, himself face to face, remembering this at the time of writing the letter, and caused her hand to fumble and drop the pen. It was the was one of few times that she had been truly afraid that her life would come to a shattering halt. Seeing the pen splatter ink on the ground, she suddenly shifted back to the present and wavered where she stood. Her eyes were focused on the blood in the snow, and she smeared the liquid from her cheeks and pushed her legs forward through calf height.  Needing the movement to keep her mind stable, she trudged along, her cloak fanning out behind her on the snow like a pool of murky water. . . . A spilt bottle of ink. Glancing down behind her and seeing this, she feel back into envisioning her hand with a quill this time, finishing the small note. "I should return," she murmured this out as she continued along away from the glowing inn. "I just remembered something to save Rynryn." Reading off the note that was permanently fixed in her mind, now waiting to be lifted and read over by the grey eyes of Xsax--Rynryn, her darling daughter that she had only truly known for a few days, in his arms--she paused once to give a glance up to the moon to give her eyes yet another taste of the moon's bitting look. The curse had to be removed, though, and that meant that there would be very heavy traveling.<br />
   <br><br><br />
She wished he could have gone with her into the lit darkness, or had caught her arm and held her within the safety of their room. If he had stopped her, she would have stayed instead of traveling out to the only surface dark elven town that she knew of. This was the port town off leagues to the North, the one that had saved her years ago from her flight from the caves that held her birthplace. Now, hopefully they would help her return. As she thought through various ways of convincing a few of the elves to follow with her as guards, her eyes ran over the forest line, searching for the pass that would lead her there.<br />
   <br><br><br />
She was dressed for war; two slender blades strapped like an <i>X</i> upon her back, slipped under the pack she had her provisions in.. daggers covered her body, some hidden from view. Her mind reeled with spells, power she had soaked up from bathing in the dark elven forest--ones that lay before the caves of her people--leagues from the town she was headed for, a wood where magic run rampant. Keeping her eyes to the line of closely knitted trees, she finally saw a slight indentation, a greying the massive black wall.<br />
   <br><br><br />
There.<br />
   <br><br><br />
She turned herself a bit so that she would head off in the right direction, and went back to fighting through the iced over snow to get to the trail. The task was becoming dulled for her, and she found her mind slipping off into deeper thoughts, wondering of what could possibly happen within the area of her House. One strong train of thought was the one that there would dark elves waiting for her, peoples that dwelt in the night time world where she had grown up for most of her many centuried life would just be able to sense her return. They would be standing around in the blackness, their warmed bodies cooled by layers of spells, hiding them from her heightened vision. Swords would be clenched in their paws, waiting to swing at her regal neck as she strolled past their hiding spots unnoticed. And if it weren't for Xsax and Ryn, she would willingly plunge herself in to the midst of their anger and attempt to cut them down limb by limb. Hate broiled deep into her marrow, glowed from her cold, calculating eyes as she thought of would might happen. Her glare fixed upon the individual trees, close enough to make out exactly where the pass cut into the woods. She then paused a step, head turning slightly so that she could gaze back upon the fading inn, just wondering if that letter had been read.<br />
   <br><br><br />
She wished he was reading it, looking out the window at this moment to see her figure, and dash out to drag her back into the inn's warmth.  It was highly unlikely, for she would have still been able to sense a small flickering of his life upon their tightly woven bond if he had been in the inn at that moment. Forcing her eyes from staring too long at the small building, she drew in a sharp breath of cold air and slipped into the pass, disappearing from sight.</p>
