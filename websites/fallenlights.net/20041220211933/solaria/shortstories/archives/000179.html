<br>Caroleena Du'Shae - Checkers<br>

<br>

<p>She should have lost her humanity a long time ago, but alas, apparently drowning a boy in the toilet wasn't enough to have her loose some compassion for the living. It was that small ounce of heart or the fact that they were just too ammusing that kept her coming back to the night club.<br />
<br><br><br />
Suffering from the loud music was certainly not a reason to return here, or the fact that it took the janitor two nights to figure out that, yes, that was someones head down the dirty toilet, and yes, it had been mashed into a mushy pulp to get it to fit.<br />
<br><br><br />
Green eyes, like the color of grass on the brightest day of noon in Ireland, scanned over the crowd, not seeing the boy she was after. It ticked her off somewhat, her fingernails digging into the meat of her palms as she gave one more glance over the weaving bodies.<br />
<br><br><br />
Letting out a nice spital from between her teeth into the shot glass of a passing lad, she straightened her "friend's" leather jacket and drew in a breath of air, pretending to actually enjoy that habit. Zeki was definatly going to get a nice beating when she saw him next, breaking a promise. Fiddling with the zipper of the jacket, she looked at one girl, weaving like an intoxicated, horny teen would, practically ingaging in mid-fuck, or dance?, with some jock. Hip movement was quite ammusing.<br />
<br><br><br />
Sickened by that blatant act out in the middle of public -- if it wasn't her that was in the steps to that harlotess dance then it was a scandle -- she pushed off of the bar and dropped to the ground, heavy boots hitting with a nice thud on the concrete floor.<br />
<br><br><br />
Pursing her lips, suddenly glad that Zeki wasn't about, she roamed the ranks of the mortals, sniffing around for one with a good set of lungs.<br />
<br><br><br />
Boredom took her usual displeasure with the mortals and turned it into a sickening need to rend one in an artistic manner across some wall, blood being the main medium. The "friend" who had kindly let her use this jacket was armless, sitting in the alley way. If he had just nicely handed her the jacket instead of flipping the bird, she would have nicely removed it without arms still within the sleeves.<br />
<br><br><br />
Hips jerking from side to side as she wove her way between a few dancers, breaking up a few couples with a foot accidently stepping on toes, she gave a good look out for something of intrest, eyes landing on a petite girl off in the shadows.<br />
<br><br><br />
Turning slightly, eyes fixing with the other girl's blank stare, she suddenly realized that the girl was knocked out of her mind. Ho-humming, she took a quick side step and met hip first into some boy that was seemingly doing the same walk as she.<br />
<br><br><br />
Giving him a critical eye as he looked down on her, she made a scoffing noise, then a faint grin on her lips that could have been mistaken for an innocent giggle.<br />
<br><br><br />
"Ye git ah smoke, buggah?" She pulled a very hard accent, one that made Zeki squirm, licking her lips with just the tip of her tongue as she attempted to worm her way with the fellow. Again, she was quite happy that her lover failed to show up for his date with her this night, he wouldn't have liked it if she had picked this fellow. And with his temper? She wouldn't have been sitting pretty for a long time, rear shining from the abuse of a belt.<br />
<br><br><br />
He looked down his nose at her once more, and failed to look away from her vivid green eyes, a light smirk on her pouty lips. Giving a dejected sigh and a flick of his hand, he motioned for her to follow him out the door. Her eyes fixed themselves upon his back as to not loose him if he decided to swing quickly out of sight to get away.<br />
<br><br><br />
He did actually try it once, stepping into a large crowd of dancers, but she was there, practically at his heels when he glanced over his shoulder. Flashing a white toothed grin at him, she jerked her chin towards the door, silently ordering him to do as she wished.<br />
<br><br><br />
Oh boy did boredom make her want different things. Letting out a soft murmur, she gave him a swift elbow into the small of his back to get him out the door quicker, tongue caught between her teeth, holding back some excitment at her ideas that ran rampit in her thoughts.<br />
<br><br><br />
And lucky for him she wasn't starving, having recently fed moments before finding him as her new play thing, or hewould have probably found his hands down his throat. Or some other odd quirky idea she would have in that state of annoying confusion and lust for hearing a scream.<br />
<br><br><br />
But she did want to hear a scream, not from her ripping his throat open to lap up blood. No, perhaps himself running his knife over his chest would make a nice noise from his lips. Or she biting of his ears? Her mind was filled with delicious images of his blood streaming out of odd locations.<br />
<br><br><br />
Then again, a few well-placed cigarette burns would also illicate a wail from that bobbing adam's apple he sported. All these thoughts flashed through her mind as she wandered down the few steps, a few brief seconds of gory details to work out.<br />
<br><br><br />
"In'ere." She curled her fingers around his elbow and lead him away from a crowd and down a rat infested alley, right next to the club to keep the noise of the ba-booming base loud enough to hide screams that she only wished to hear.<br />
<br><br><br />
The bricks were rough in a few sections, even coated with a sticky film in one certain spot. And this was the spot where she bid him to pause and light up, crossing her arms under her breasts, eyes peering up over his face. He was being wary, but not protesting one bit, for she assumed he was guessing just what she was. Her eyes strolled over the curve of his long neck, finding a few un-saliva healed marks. Tsking, she rested her weight on one foot, pondering this kill like an artist would consider the pose of the model.<br />
<br><br><br />
Though as she stood there without taking one of his smokes, he paled some, and she guessed that he was figuring she was going to sink her teeth into his neck. Or.. clear through? Hrm, another tasty idea she could save for later on. She lost herself in thought for a moment as she invisioned what it would look like with her biting his neck, then nawing through to the bone and licking it til it was gleaming white. Shuddering with that thought, she let out an unconsious purr, then a cackle as she looked up at the tall one. He was biting down hard on his lip, probably attempting to keep himself from getting excited.<br />
<br><br><br />
Pulling her fingers through a clump of tiny braids that made up her hairstyle, she quickly knotted them back to get them out of her way. She loved her hair, was very vain about the way it was kept neat, and blood within it was unacceptable.<br />
<br><br><br />
"Don't.. don't you want one, girl?" He stammered out, eyes becoming owlishly large as she peered back up at him, moving a hand so that her fingers could tap at his chest.<br />
<br><br><br />
"Neh, I be thinkin' fer a bit longah, if'n ye donna mind." She narrowed her eyes some, as if squinting to see him clearly. He would have to be a pretty death, to set off the fine features of his high cheek bones. . . . and no skin or muscle or anything but vein and bone? Tilting her head slightly, she studied harder. No. Some skin, maybe patchwork.<br />
<br><br><br />
And every other one of that patchwork would be red! Her lips curved into a devilish look, eyes glinting with lust for death as she looked over his features, fingers moving from her hand to his chest. Exerting a bit of her own skill, she easily shoved the slender boy back up against the rough wall, her hip grinding up against his to keep him in place. "Ye'ah gonna become quite a purty boy, in me own opinion that is."<br />
<br><br><br />
His adam's apple bobbed as he swallowed hard, coming to realize that he wasn't going to be fed from after all, but something far, far worse. He looked as if all his blood ran from his toes out onto the pavement, for he turned as white as a sheet.<br />
<br><br><br />
"Do me a favah?" she purred out lightly, rolling her tongue to add to the vibrations of her noises, the licked over her lips quickly. Her fingers that pressed against his chest suddenly dug into his thin tee-shirt, shreading it with a harsh ripping sound in a blink of her eyes. "Me be a'wantin' ye ta be screamin' like a banshee back in'de homeland, yes?"<br />
<br><br><br />
His mouth opened to let out a question, she was sure it was going to be why?, but his chance came and went as her fingers drew a line down the center of his chest, blood bubbling to the surface. If she had kept in practice, she would have been able to keep him alive til half his skin was left, maybe even concious. But, nay, she was quite out of practice, too busy with being a mate to a mortal to keep herself occupied with passing some of the dull nights away.<br />
<br><br><br />
To her shock, the boy uttered not a sound, making her wonder if he choked on something. But raising her eyes from the driblets of blood that now ran slowly down to seep into his jeans, she noted that he was watching her, eyes foggy with pain and shock.<br />
<br><br><br />
With a chuckle she realized her idea of his blood having been drained through his toes to the pavement was definatly not the case. For there it was, bright as any other blood she had seen fresh from a body, dripping over her fingers as well. She wouldn't have his blood, for play things and meals were two seperate wants in her mind. Maybe after him, she'd dine on that blonde girl that looked stoned back in the club.<br />
<br><br><br />
As her fingers stroked back upwards again, adding a second line, he finally broke down and ripped a wailing cry from his lips, bubbling salvia as if he had been planning on saving the spit to fling into her face.<br />
<br><br><br />
"That's ah boy.." she giggled out childishly, eyes glinting with some mixture of happiness and need to have heard that wail. Removing her fingers from his flesh, she held him as he slumped forward, muscles having gone lax with the pain of torture. Purring soothingly, as if that would keep him alive any longer, she handled him like a mother would a dying babe and carefully laid him out on the wet pavement of the alleyway. Shuffling so that she was kneeling besides him, she rested her hand back on his wounds, letting the blood coat the bottom of her palm.<br />
<br><br><br />
She sat there for a moment, trying to remember what it was like to feel a heart pounding from within her self, but decades faded a memory like that quickly. Even breathing, if she had to fit into the crowd a bit easier, would mean that she had to watch someone to remember the movements. And he was still doing both quite well, eyes closed so that he didn't have to see his slayer's face. But his breathing was strained and rapid, his heart feeling as if it wanted to pop out of his chest. Maybe later she'd help it free of it's prison between the ribs.<br />
<br><br><br />
"Ye know? I should'ah learn anatomy sometime. Would be makin' dis easier." She gave a soft chuckle as he forced an eye open to look at her oddly, then closed it again as he uttered out a soft groan. She should try and keep him alive a bit longer, mabye even heal him up after she decorated his skin with bloodworked patches like a quilt. Just to give him a gift for being such a good boy.<br />
<br><br><br />
Or, she could just have fun this night and leave the body to make the papers in the morning. That too was awfully ammusing, for they could never find the killer. Maybe the cops would be smart and connect this killing to the one with the kid stuffed down a toilet.<br />
<br><br><br />
Shrugging to her rambles of thought as she felt his heart under her hand, she suddenly turned a bit to lean closer to his chest, fingers going back to their etching through his skin<br />
<br><br><br />
His raving screams started up again as soon as her fingers cut through the flesh.<br />
<br><br><br />
"Dat's me boy. Bellow and rave likin' death be swallowing ye before ye die. I wish i had'ah camera ta remember dis with images." She hummed out of tune some lullaby as she made a few quick crossing lines, beginning the checker board pattern on his chest. Soon, if she got bored with this, she'd peel back every other section of his skin. The classic red/white checkered pattern used often for picnic blankets.<br />
<br><br><br />
She lifted her fingers for a moment, shaking off excess blood before peering at his high cheeked face, smirking lightly as she leaned over, prying his eyes open. "Ye dead yet?"<br />
<br><br><br />
The poor kid actually shook his head, foolishly. If he had remained still. . . well? she probably would have gotten bored within a moment and left him to rot or heal before any skin was removed.<br />
<br><br><br />
"Tsk." she hissed down at him and let his eye close again, listening to the way he was forcing air down his lungs. The pattern she had left on his chest stretched as he inhaled, letting loose a new stream of blood over the wounds.<br />
<br><br><br />
Ignoring his worriful whimpers, she played the flat of her hand over the wounds, watching them stretch out and fill with blood. Cocking her head slightly to the side, she lost her intrest quickly in playing with his chest area.<br />
<br><br><br />
Tiptoing her fingers up over his neck til her nails rested on his chin, she suddenly sliced the thin layer of skin over the bone, following the line of his jaw, then up towards his ear. Blood trailed her touch, and she continued up to his temple, the snuck across his brow. She was following his hair line then, as if tracing the contours of his face. her finger then dove down back to his other ear, then once again across this side of the jaw til she met the starting point.<br />
<br><br><br />
"Now. Ye wanna 'ave a pattern, or shall I jest remove all of it?" He though, during the corse of the travel, had let out one terrified wail and passed out, almost to where she thought he had died.<br />
<br><br><br />
But she had glanced down at his chest and saw a very slow lifting motion that gave away the fact that he still lived and probably felt this pain in the back of his mind.<br />
<br><br><br />
Stewing over the ideas of either following the pattern she had started or just peeling off his flesh, she sat back for a moment, giving him a break.<br />
<br><br><br />
She gave him one more careful look to see if he'd bother answering her, then her lips split into a chesire grin and she dropped forward to rest her knees in the spilt blood of this boy. Her long nails carefully pushed their way under the line she had made on his jaw, picking at it to get part of it free of the muscle binding materials.<br />
<br><br><br />
Yes, she had to take some class to figure out what the names of the body parts were as she destroyed them, would probably make it more enjoyable.<br />
<br><br><br />
His body bucked! and she let out a howl of glee, lifting her hand from his face to lick at his blood, just to taste the blood as it started to die, spilling into his hair, making it clump in an unsightly mess. Her eyes, livid with pure excitement, watched as he spasmed some, probably going through a few moments of painful death. She hardly cared now if he lived longer or died, this was too ammusing to watch as he twisted a few times, cracking the start of scabs on his chest, letting more blood run.<br />
<br><br><br />
"Die.. com'on.." she murmured encouragedly, her hand free of her mouth to be back down at his cheek, prying off his flesh, revealing the meat below it, glistening with brillant scarlet blood.<br />
<br><br><br />
As she worked up, inch by painful inch, his flesh from the muscles, continued to coo a soft chant for him to die, giggling inbetween words as if she was a girl again, pretending to act like one of those mystical witches casting a spell. And then, like the spell at worked, a bubbling sigh flew from his lips and his body relaxed from the tauntness it had held for the entire opperation.<br />
<br><br><br />
Blood flowed like rivers over her hands and into his hair, the other half of his face just pretty and pale and pure white. A serene look to his half ruined face, eyes closed as if having fallen asleep and not half torn apart.<br />
<br><br><br />
Suddenly stopping, she peered at the fact that half his face was scarlet, and the other white as bone, a brow arching. It was pretty, she supposed, in a messy sort of way.<br />
<br><br><br />
Snorting out lightly, she brought her hand away from the loosed flesh, and slipped her nail down the center of his face from top to bottom. The skin came free of him easily, flopping down into her other hand.<br />
<br><br><br />
Glancing over her shoulder, as if suddenly suspsious of an audience, she tossed the half of face over her shoulder, grimacing at the plopping wet noise it made when it smacked against the brick. Leaving a bloody imprint that would dry come daylight, the skin slumped down behind a garbage can, a meal for a few rats perhaps.<br />
<br><br><br />
Humming under her breath again, she sat back on her heals, hands moving to his ripped up shirt to clean off some of the blood, but left a pinkish stain on her pale hands and red smears under her long nails.<br />
<br><br><br />
She then got to her feet to peer down at his body, admiring her 'artistic' work, wondering if she should bother writing a title for it nearby. Shrugging her shoulders, not really into the art scene, she merely looked over the work, grinning lightly.<br />
<br><br><br />
His chest was as if he had run into a fence, hard enough that the wire had cut through his skin. But his face? Hard to explain that work. Maybe like the phantom of the opera, though the ugly side very showing to the world, not hidden by the mask.<br />
<br><br><br />
Her eyes moved away from his body, towards the street far off in the distance, watching the usual crowds of drunken or overly hormoned kiddies stumble from the club as it closed its doors for the day. That being her clue that the sun would be showing its ugly head shortly, she absently gave a kick to his body, nudging it about so that it lay just right.<br />
<br><br><br />
What a pretty gift to leave the police when they came out to search for the boy that afternoon. And knowing her luck, the paper would print a picture with a blurb, and Zeki reading it.<br />
<br><br><br />
Maybe he'd be proud of her.</p>
