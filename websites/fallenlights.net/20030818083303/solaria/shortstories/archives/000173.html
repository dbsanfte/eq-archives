<br>Motes of Dust<br>

<br>

<p><p><i>Scritch.  Scritch.  Scratch.</i><br /><br />
<br><br><br /><br />
A mote the size of a million atoms of something--which came out to the size of a normal speck of dust in the air--caught the light of the rising sun.  Floating along, not minding anything in its downward, then upward, then downward, then upward descent along an unseen path.  It brushed along the length of a dead tree, smoothed and polished until it glittered like a scrap of gold.  Even more piles of deadness littered its flat self, covered with slabs of beaten animal skin.  There was even a feather that was carved at one end and filled with some gooey black stuff.  The million atom sized bit of dust (maybe some skin that had leapt to its death from a person) even got caught in a splinter that was missed when the dead, flat wood was rubbed down and oiled with a golden color.  Twisting and turning until a faint breeze of some giant (the person it fell off of) that lived there freed it to start its upward descent once again.<br /><br />
<br><br><i>Scratchscratch.  Scritch.</i><br /><br />
<br><br>A mote the size of a million atoms of the person was launched upwards at a faster descent, then plummeted into an ascending, twisting, bouncing. . . .  Wait.  That little bit of dust was upside down so the descent was really going up instead of down.  Fixing itself with a little shove against some more particles of air that it was a million times larger set it straight.  The block of dead, highly polished, golden toned wood was now miles and miles away.  At least to the mote of dust it was miles and miles and miles, to the person in which the mote was born from it was only a few inches.  But then, even a million atoms are really not much at all.<br /><br />
<br><br><br /><br />
<i>Scratch.  Scritch.  Scribble.  Scratchscritchscratch.</i><br /><br />
<br><br><br /><br />
A mote the size of a million, minus one, atoms (one fell off when righting itself) zipped its way through the air with a cheerful screech of joy.   Oh how wonderful it was to be a million minus one sized mote and be able to dash and dive and go upside down without even knowing it through the cold air and not even crash into a bit of air on the way.  Poor, poor humans.  They were so big that air did not even have a chance to go around the body before being sucked into their caves that held more air trapped.  Air was not something fun to bump into, for they were mean atoms.  So along the mote of dust moved through the air, soaring miles and miles above another bit of dead wood, though this one was covered with mountains of flattened parts of dead wood.  Poor, poor tree.  Feeling sad as it traveled through the nearly empty air, the mote wondered just what king of cruel thing (the person it fell off of, in fact) would kill a tree just to make it flat and shiny.  It took a few moments, years rather, for the million minus one mote to realize that the giant that had freed it earlier from the splinter was at the table.<br /><br />
<br><br><br /><br />
<i>Scritch.  Scritch.  Scratch.</i><br /><br />
<br><br><br /><br />
A mote the size of one less then a million atoms tried desperately to halt its zipping motion through the near empty air.  It wanted to see why this person was using that feather with the gooey stuff, amazed that the bird actually let this person pluck a feather from its wing and. . .   Poor, poor bird.  Ah, yes!  A breeze suddenly appeared from behind, or was that in front of?  The mote was too twisted up in up and down to really ever know which way was which.  It found itself stopped for a fraction of a moment before zooming downwards and closer and closer and closer to see what this person was doing.<br /><br />
<br><br><br /><br />
<i>Scratch.  Scritch.  Scribble.  Scratchscritchscratch. Scritch.  Scritch.  Scratch.</i><br /><br />
<br><br><br /><br />
A mote the size of a million atoms (one more decided to latch onto it in its fall) ran closer and closer and closer to this person.  And closer, even.  Then there were bright lights and loud noises and a snorting sound that made the poor, poor mote near deaf.<br /><br />
<br><br><br /><br />
<i>AH-CHOO!!</i><br /><br />
<br><br><br /><br />
A dead mote the size of a million atoms was flung out of the person's nose that had borne it only minutes earlier.  That dust mote of skin traveled like a rocket ship across the room and into a crowd of other such motes to float listlessly before a sunny window, sparkling like a speck of gold.  Poor, poor mote.</p></p>
