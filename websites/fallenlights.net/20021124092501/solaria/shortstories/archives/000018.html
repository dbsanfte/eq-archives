<br><br>
<p>Wakening. The sun drifted lower past the dirt covered buildings, sending them glowing with a redden hue as if they had all burst into flames. This was when she always awoke, missing this spectacle, curtains drawn tightly, stapled into the molding around the dusty windows. She lay in stupor for a moment or three, eyes staring upwards at the water stained, high-ceiling, body buried deep in the mattress. <br />
<br><br><br />
Her shape was nearly permanent in the old mattress, she always dropped off into her coma-like state in the same position, hands resting on her belly, head tilted back just slightly as if she were trying to look at the wall behind her; she looked dead. <br />
<br><br><br />
Pale with raven's locks, she continued to try to awaken, lips parting to let her tongue slip out to moisten them.<br />
<br><br><br />
There was a moment of un-broken silence, as if the whole world had fallen off into slumber as her eyes stared blankly, what ever pretense of life she had been playing was gone. Since he was not here, she had no worries of keeping her chest rising and falling, no worries with trying to make what blood she had in her system warm to touch. <br />
<br><br><br />
At the thought of veins pumping throughout her body, she sat up. She had just bent her waist, top half of her body rising, hips and lower not moving as of yet, like they had yet to be drawn from the sleep she had been pulling free of. <br />
<br><br><br />
Dark, brooding eyes blinked a few times, glancing towards the slight glow that framed the heavy, black, velvet curtains, watching it diminish. Time was soon coming to her side and she twisted again, feet hitting the floor soundlessly, she standing with another graceless movement. Mechanically, she dressed, slipping into fish-net stockings, tugging a pleated black and grey plaid skirt up to her hips, then buttoning up a white blouse and tucking it in. Here was where she paused, deciding what shoes to don on. Sometimes, she was actually picky on how she looked. The boots. <br />
<br><br><br />
Moments later she stepped from the apartment, pausing to rest her hip on the doorframe, eyes following a few people that strolled past her place. A grin spread upon her lips.<br />
<br><br><br />
"What light, beyond some.. window breaks." She giggled this out softly, trying to remember the words. Her voice held an eerie quality, cracking a bit as she forced it to work, for it had been unused for a good number of hours. She tilted her head a bit, eyes still focused upon this fading couple, hardly noticing the way her millions of braids hit against her checks by the wind. <i>Rain tonight at sometime,</i> she thought to herself as she stepped from the stoop. <br />
<br><br><br />
"To be? Or not to be..." She waited a moment, projecting her Irishly tainted voice before her down the street, waiting to see if the two noticed her steady, penetrating gaze upon their necks. "What be thy question?" This was asked to herself as she strolled after them, gait slow and steady, boots thumping on the ground lightly making it sound as if she were further off then she really was. "Which shall give me thy life first? Tha'tis thee question." <br />
<br><br><br />
"HARK! I be hearin' the nightin' gale cluck like a lustful swallow. Be still, ye two lovebirds, I bid a question to thee." Maniacal giggle that was left unheard, for her words finally hit their ears, but the giggle was left to the wind. The two paused and glanced over their shoulders at this girl, one that was dressed like a good Catholic school goer.<br />
<br><br><br />
Hop, skip, and a jump. She reached their sides and proffered a curtsy, winning a hidden smile from the gentleman, a reproachful look from the lass. "Stay thysevles.. I bid ye a moment of thee time?" And as soon as the lass glanced over her shoulder to see if anyone was in the area, the girl gave the man a daring wink, licking her lips before giving the lass a too pretty smile. Drawing in a breath, she bloomed two blushes over her cheeks, something that was difficult for her at the state she was in. <i>Damn that meal from last night,</i> she glowered inside, already knowing that these two would fill her well and make up for the lack of her own life. <br />
<br><br><br />
The gentleman motioned for her to ask away, and so she did. "I be offerin' a suggestion to thee both, for thee look as if ye'd be lookin' for a party to be going to?" Two nods, for they were probably only in their twenties, she finally realized -- something that took her a while now; guessing the mortal's ages. Boldly, she stepped between the gent and his lass, clasping her fingers around their elbows and turned them down an alley way, singing a bawdy song to pass the time.<br />
<br><br><br />
<i>Now.. it's play time.</i> Her voice giggled through her mind, dark eyes flicking from the one on her right to the one on her left. The lass'll scream if he goes first. The gent will punch if his lady offers the sacrifice. But if both? Challenge. She pondered away in her mind as she sang a sweet folk tune loudly, her grip tight, cutting off their circulation as she dragged them down the rat infested world. <br />
<br><br><br />
"Soooooooooo, ye ever meet the wall?" Blank looks were handed back to her and she gave them a bold grin. With a heaving jerk of her hands, she brought them swinging out before her, the female twisting up into the man's arms. Her hands freed them, and they fell to the ground like two lovers collapsing into bed after a long night of sporting. With a heavy, well aimed kick, she sent the man's jaw up to meet his top row teeth, spilling out some of his blood. She frowned at this as she jumped into the fray, catching the woman under her arms and dragged her over to the wall, a few back hands making her think twice about opening her mouth to cry for help.<br />
<br><br><br />
"Sommmmme wheerrrre over thee rainboooow.. Skies beeeee bluue.." She preened a bit as she fluffed out her millions of braids, singing loudly to cover up the groans of the semi-unconscious gent behind her. Leaning in closer to the woman so that their faces were blurred within each others sight, giving the gent a good view of her rear if he did happen to look, she crooned out after the end of her song. "Detour." This was in answer to the woman's plea about thinking that they were going to a nightclub. "Ye'll be getting there, I promise ye that. Just be a bit paler, but thee be fittin' in with e'eryone else." <br />
<br><br><br />
Her eyes were focused upon the typical feeding spot, fangs extracting as she opened her mouth to place a kiss upon the woman's neck, her hands lifting to wrap fingers around her shivering arms to keep her still. Eyes of the woman suddenly went wide at the prick of teeth, worst nightmares of ghoulies and goblins and things that went bump in the night suddenly becoming true. Then a sigh of pleasure bubbled out from her lips, the girl chuckling as she daintily drew free some of the life. <i>Thought the li'l gal be'd likin' it..</i> She had a knack of picking out the pleasure hunting party goers. <br />
<br><br><br />
The gent behind her moaned out, the sound of something rolling around alerted her and she drew away from the woman's neck, carefully licking up the wound so that she'd be able to go to the party without dripping blood the entire way. <br />
<br><br><br />
Swinging around, knees off the ground so her stockings didn't tear, she moved in on the prone gent, licking over her lips once more.<br />
<br><br><br />
"Chrisssst," the man wailed out, shying away after seeing his gal draping over a few tipped garbage cans. <br />
<br><br><br />
Her lips pulled into a deep frown as she crouched there, arms around her legs, calves tightly pressed together so he didn't get a good view of what was up her skirt. "It be time, good sirrah." <br />
<br><br><br />
He offered her a blank look, for he had missed what had had just been going on with his lass. Snorting under her breath, she whipped her hand around to slap his cheek, the brought her palm back to redden his other. "Ye daffer then me thought." Running her tongue gingerly over one of her fangs, she pulled herself closer, using him as the weight to do so. As if pushing him into a bed, she straddled his belly, muttering sourly because her knees splashed into muckpuddles. Her hand thumped lightly over his heart for a moment, squirming a bit as she looked him over. "Ye wanna go all thee way?" Implying sex, she wiggled her rear against his belly.. wondering if he'd catch on that she'd be takin' his life, not just some of his blood.<br />
<br><br><br />
It took him a moment to think this over, eyes upon the lass that was seemingly asleep, then back up at this pale one with a hungry grin. His hands moved to grip her ankles, and she leaned closer to his face, elbows resting on his shoulders to keep him from moving around too much. "Yes, or.. no?" Wiggle, wiggle. <br />
<br><br><br />
He only managed a groan, ripping his eyes away from his date completely, looking at her teeth only. <br />
<br><br><br />
Her lips pouted at him. Sad. It's been such a long time since she had killed someone, and she wondered if she had lost her skills. Fingers tapped over his forehead, nails biting softly into his flesh as he laid under her, unsure of what to do in this situation. <br />
<br><br><br />
A moment passed. "Too late." She now gave him no chance to say no. Her nails pressed in harder, ripping flesh a bit as she drew her hand an inch or three lower. Opening her mouth wide just as he registered the pain, her loud song burst from her lips just as he let out a grunting wail.<br />
<br><br><br />
For some reason, singing helped her work better. It drown out screams that might alert people. She would have clipped his tongue from his mouth if she hadn't liked his voice, but his pleasant treble was giving her a broad grin as she worked with his face, etching pretty squiggles over his cheeks. <br />
<br><br><br />
He bucked as her fingers pinched his mouth together, and she let out a bubble of laughter, shifted up on his body so that she could dig her knees onto his shoulders, keeping him firm to the ground. "What's wrong?" Crooning voice, lisping with peals of laughter. "Big, mister boy donna like play time?" <br />
<br><br><br />
Shaking his head in a way to say no --lips still in her pinching nails. But that was a mistake for it gave her a good reason to let his lips slid between her nails as if a sawing motion, blood pouring out as he halfway cut his own mouth off. <br />
<br><br><br />
"HEeeeeeeyah. Ye's gettin' me shirt all mussed." Indeed, a few droplets of crimson had splashed onto her pure white, starched blouse, her mouth pulling into an unpleased pout. Then she burst out into a giggle, her hand moving from his ruined lips, tracing down his neck with her finger tip, tickling along the way. <br />
<br><br><br />
A pained giggling scream burst from his lips in a pathetic quietness for she was compressing his lungs, not allowing him to breath in enough to get loud again.<br />
<br><br><br />
As his breath drew to an end, she rocked a bit on his lungs, singing under her breath quietly in time to his soft grunts of pain. She glanced over her artwork, watching the blood drip over his brow, her other hand lifting to smear the red stains down his nose, painting him completely with the blood. <br />
<br><br><br />
His hands were still gripped tightly to her ankles, squeezing every time she dug into his skin with her short nails, letting a few droplets flow over his neck. She leaned down to taste him as well, and ended up bitting his neck hard and suckling away even more blood, chuckling out softly as he grunted with faint pleasure at this. <br />
<br><br><br />
He was the one that wanted this. <br />
<br><br><br />
Pulling her lips back, she licked up his neck, healing some of the finger bites so that he wouldn't bleed to death before she was through with him. <br />
<br><br><br />
Feeling his hard gaze upon her forehead, she tipped her head up a bit, smiling at him all too sweetly, brows arching as she tried to pull an innocent look. He was still shuddering between her legs -- which were clenched tightly to the sides of his chest -- whimpering out with a pleasured pain, lost on how to behave now. <br />
<br><br><br />
Silently, she went back up to work as his face, rather his ears, fingers stroking around the ridge before pinching down as if intending to give him pierced ears. <br />
<br><br><br />
Timing it right yet once again, she burst out with an old folk diddy as he yowled out with pain, and would have rolled over if she had not been squishing him into the mud soaked pavement.<br />
<br><br><br />
The tune was a quick little thing and she shut up as his air ran out again, gasping as he tried to draw in a ragged breath of air through his three holed mouth. Well, it looked like she would have to go back and change before searching out that other boy. She had glanced down at her blouse after watching him breath through the extra mouths she had given him, fingers not bitting any where for the moment, rather just tapping upon his brow as she hummed out softly, her eyes holding his gaze. <br />
<br><br><br />
He didn't even try to struggle. <br />
<br><br><br />
She pouted at this thought, crimson stained lips offering him the sad look. He had displeased her greatly, for she had been hoping he was a fighter. She didn't even bother reasoning in that there was no way he'd be able to move with his body pinned under her, but he could have kicked around like a fish out of water. She had wanted some kind of show. <br />
<br><br><br />
With a wrinkling up nose, figuring he had enough time to refill his lungs for another go at wailing with pain, she lifted her hand to his chin, pushing his head back. She forced him to keep his eyes opened, her free hand shifting to pull open his eyelids, making him look down the alley way. "I donna want thee to watch this one, for it be a nasty-nasty." <br />
<br><br><br />
She slid her hips down to his belly again, and leaned forward so that her chest was against his, her mouth just under his chin, licking at the drying blood from the earlier diggings. Then tilting her head a bit so that she could reach at his flesh with a fang, she nipped down into the softness just under his chin. <br />
<br><br><br />
The hand that had been tiling his face back suddenly dropped over his mouth... mouths. This time, when he screamed, she'd not be able to sing out a song, her mouth busy with biting into his throat. <br />
<br><br><br />
She felt him tense under herself and she grinned, bitting so that her teeth --all of her teeth-- sank through his skin. Snapping her jaw shut tight, she pulled her face away and spit the wad of skin off towards the side of the wall. <br />
<br><br><br />
That was when <i>she</i> screamed. <br />
<br><br><br />
Jerking her head back, she glared at the awakened lass, snarling wildly for the interruption.<br />
<br><br><br />
Scrubbing her hand over her mouth, she kicked herself free from the limp body, then gave a hearty kick to his side for not having been a good gent. He had been too docile. With a livid glare at the woman, she stepped her way over, tongue licking up the last of the man's blood from her lips and hand. <br />
<br><br><br />
Dropping to a crouch, she brought the newly cleaned hand around in a hard, snapping slap, sending the woman crashing into a few trash cans. "I hate being interrupted." This was howled out with a controlled rage, glaring at the woman who also displeased her. <br />
<br><br><br />
"The damned bitch fainted." <br />
<br><br><br />
Rolling her eyes, she got to her feet again and moved back to the dead body. It was never her style to leave a victim laying in his own blood and soils. It was dragged over to where the woman lay unconscious. It was draped over the woman's body, and her arm shifted and moved to wrap around the man's waste as if hugging him tightly, his blood dripping steadily down the females cheek. <br />
<br><br><br />
Looking over the pair, she snorted softly. At least she had gotten a decent meal tonight.<br />
