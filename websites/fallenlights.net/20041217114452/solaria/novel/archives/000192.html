<br>Chapter 1 - Av'Era'Liza<br>

<br>

<p>Forests grew thick and silent in some areas of the world.</p>

<p>One area in particular, the forest seemed to be void of almost all light to a point where travelers had to carry a lantern to guide the way. Though even that helping light seemed to be sucked and pulled away from the warm center of a thick candle to vanish into nothing in just a few feet. Attached to a long five foot pole that swayed slightly with the motion of plodding horse's feet, the glow only saturated a few inches before where her feet went, guiding enough so that she saw the brambles and twisted roots that were there to catch her up. They seemed to spring out of nowhere, as if living snakes that sensed the vibrations of her and the horse's steps drawing near to resting-places, and wrap around her ankles to stop her forward motion. She learned, after many bruises to her knees, that she had to slow her pace from a quick, bold stride to that of a careful picking and choosing of where to place her feet. Falling hurt, especially onto gnarled roots or pricking thorns over three inches long and it was always her poor knees that took the brunt of the damage, luckily the palms of her hands had yet to smack against anything dangerous. She also figured out that gripping with a death's grip to the reins of the bridle, it would keep her from moving too fast or falling, only to stumble if she took a misstep. The horse did not seem to mind the occasional jerk to the reins, causing its head to be yanked forward or done, for it meant that it was not alone in this dank place. The smell made both their nostrils flare with deep intakes of breath, shivers running down her spine every few minutes and shaking her head to clear out the moldy taste that developed in the back of her throat. Coughing was what the horse did once in a while, or snorting out puffs of hot air down the back of her neck.</p>

<p>Coughing out was exactly what the horse did suddenly; jerking its head up and dragging its walking partner backwards and away from a snarled root. Either it saw the looping natural trap and forced itself to snap away, or it was pure coincidence that she was saved from a rather nasty fall. Her eyes shifted away from the ground as she hung to the reins, trying to gain her feet again, and glanced upwards at her grey mount. Again she wished that the silly horse would let her sit upon its back, but each time she attempted to swing up onto the saddle, it would sulk and twist itself back a few feet. Straightening herself finally as the horse just stood there gazing off into the darkness, she glanced out and around as well, sniffing the air some as she attempted to look passed the red haze of light. Curling her fingers tightly into the leather reins, she tugged gently to start moving again, stepping over the nasty root and guiding the horse's feet as well.</p>

<p>She hated this forest. With a passion she hated it, for she had been through it many times before, and once was in flight from death. But all the other times save this one, she had magic to help push away the dreadful shadows, now it was just a flickering, dim little candle that forced the shadows to stay back. They fought good and strong though, pushing the light into a tight circle, not letting her see what lay beyond. It was as if the forest did not want to give away some secret it kept hidden off the path she walked---if she could call the root and bramble covered ground she walked upon a path. Her lip was curled into a displeased snarl for most of the half-day's journey, eyes set in a stern glare to try and probe passed the boundaries of the red light, seeking some other natural source of day. With white knuckled fingers from the grip that she had on the horse's reins, she continued forward, eyes flicking down to the edge of the light on the pine needle covered ground, following the path that was not really a path. Though to one that knew this forest somewhat, there really was a path just not in the normal way. There was no over-used wear and tear, the forest saw to keeping all sign of passing hidden, but there were signs of direction to travel.</p>

<p>Seeing that the needles were still lying eastwards, she lifted her golden gaze back to searching for nothing. She removed one hand quickly from the reins to tug sharply at her fur trimmed cloak, drawing it over her shoulders tightly to block not the wind, but the pressure of a hidden gaze. It was the sense that the horse had as well as she, of eyes that probed inwards towards them watching that they made no false step off of the route. And this was growing stronger the closer she made her way to her destination, hand now dropping from the soft, warm fabric to the hard touch of a pummel wrapped with stiff leather, worn down to the shape of her slim fingers. The sudden touch of her hand made the sheath tap softly against her thigh and stirred the metal clips that held it to her body, the noise startling the horse to give a loud snort in annoyance, eyes rolling to look towards her. But, then it was back to looking at where it would set its feet, figuring that she was the one to break the silence. Ignoring the beast of burden, she continued to search for something out there, knowing that if it wanted to be seen she would have been dead or caught in a trap by now. No, what ever that searching and probing gaze was that had been following her traveling was only there to watch.</p>

<p>There were rumors about this forest in particular, more so than any other one on this half of the world, for its shadows were the deepest and least penetrable, and people got lost constantly after spending half a day within its depths. Some rumors, like that of some how following a natural path was true; the one about the green slime that descended upon people that fell asleep under a certain type of tree was not. The path she knew about, only because she had been shown the correct way of reading the needles that never blew around in the stiff wind that would appear from time to time, and so even her slow travel was a quick one, for she would not have to dally with searching out some man made walkway. They lay with their tips to the east, slightly traveling south now, leading a city deep within the quiet forest. Only those from that home knew how to find it again, a safety precaution and death would be swiftly given if ever a stranger happened to stumble upon the hidden land, even if it was by happenstance. She figured that the watching was the Guard, following her trail and sending back reports that someone was on their way through. There would be someone waiting for her, for another rumor was that of a hidden city, one that was quite true or she was lying to herself. A heavily guarded city protected well against almost every element and creature and race.</p>

<p>To her, it was an old home, but one that would not welcome her with open arms and smiling faces. She would be lucky if she came out of the forest and across the clearing with no wounds. Unless the Guard's leader was in a benevolent temperament for the next few hours, or it was a new leader and generation that had forgotten about her. But if that were the case, she would have been dead a long time ago, bristling with arrows like a porcupine.</p>

<p>At that thought she stopped and glanced off over her shoulder, expecting to see the streak of silver flying towards her body. Instead, she saw what it was that had made her pause her train of thought, eyes widening just a bit out of surprise. Light, a pure white sun's glow trickled and dappled over the ground, the color of green leaves hazily appearing just to her right. And a breeze hit her lean figure then, causing her to step back against the horse for protection, eyes averting to the darkness before her and to the right. Curious, for she thought that there was a while longer to walk, she dropped her yellow toned eyes to her feet. Her head cocked to the side and she pursed her lips, fingers uncurling from the pummel of her weapon as she bent down and ran her hand over the needles. Just to see if it was an illusion on her senses. But no, the needles did not falter under her touch, just shifted naturally. There was no wavering or bending of the light that illusions usually gave, that and the people that lived within the hidden city were deaf to the art of magic.</p>

<p>Sniffing the air, she glanced while crouched down off to the left again, and yes, there was some dancing light as wind caused branches to move shadow about. The needles were suddenly pointing in that direction, she wondering how she had failed to notice the change. But now it didn't matter, for there was the sunlight, the end of the path and the beginning of a field of grass. Staying close to the ground, she leaned back, putting weight on her hands so that she could futilely scan the over head branches, fully knowing that there would be nothing but darkness up there. Which was exactly the case. Only at the end of the path did the forest break apart and let light fall and reveal that it was an actual forest, that end was off to the left.</p>

<p>She let out a sudden hiss of surprise, flinging herself forward under the pressure of a warm muzzle at her back, the horse whinnying softly and nudging her to keep going, hinting that there was no way it wanted to stay in this realm much longer then needed. Swatting her hand harshly back against the side of her horse's head, she pushed her hands into the deep bed of needles and lurched to her feet, hesitantly taking a few steps off towards the light. Warily she looked about, upwards towards the breaking a part shadows, searching the branches for signs of guards with arrows. Nothing was there as her eyes passed along the branches, all but leaves and blue sky and some clouds. Her bravery was seeping out into the ground as she continued to walk forward, boots plodding a little too loudly against the thick carpet, the horse sounding like ten. And by the time she reached the last few tracings of needles, she was practically shaking with uptight nerves, eyes darting about quickly. What she was looking for was not her death, but how she was going to be received by people who had exiled her over a decade earlier.</p>

<p>Drawing in a deep breath of crisp, fall air, the horse suddenly barreled its head up against the small of her back, forcing her to fully leave the dreadful forest behind. The soles of her worn boots hit the hardness of a brick path, but she did not look down. She could not. Her eyes were fixed upon a blackened mass of dull rock, on towers that spun up towards the sky in the center of the mass, tips catching the sun and glowing with a golden hue. A lone statue stood halfway down the black road, an angel with wings spread and hands aching to try and touch the clouds. Head thrown back, neck exposed, the marble statue stood in a frozen moment of a scream of fright. She knew that tears had even been carved trickling down its rounded cheeks. She knew for that was the last thing she saw before being beaten into unconsciousness.</p>

<p>It was the marker of the dead race, the forgotten ones that lived within that stronghold of onyx and marble and granite. It stood there from since she had been a child and probably long before then. The sari carved it in the middle of a great war, leaving it to stand as a reminder of the ruining of an old bond. The statue was of the first sarian citizen slain by the hand of their brothers. An image of what it must have been like to feel a cold blade being run through the belly, of seeing whom it was that held the pummel. She was of that enemy race, but to the sari, she was one of them, for the magic that had been outlawed and then swiftly bred out of the blood hide her true self in a lie.</p>

<p>Her eyes dropped from the silently screaming angel, looking back over her shoulder at the thick forest that did not seem as heavily foreboding as it had at the start of her walk that morning. And it only took that one moment of her head being turned. For in the next, the prick of a sharp blade was against her side, the grip of a strong hand upon her arm holding her from running. </p>



<p>____________________

<p>"It's been ten years, you know?" Jeff asked quite suddenly after a few long moments of quiet, stepping to one side to let a stream of young children gallop passed, a grin plastering itself onto his thick jawed face. He stood almost at six foot tall, something of a giant within the city, and bald except for a heavy braid left at the nape of his neck to run down his back. Grey eyes followed the last of the children as they spun around a corner; the yipping and giggles vanishing with the last that fled up another street. Looking down a bit towards his friend, he waited for him to give back attention.</p>

<p>A gaze was returned finally after the last of the noise drained away and they were left in somewhat peace, for the two sari were walking down the middle of the market, a slow pace to let others clear out of their way long before they got there. "Ten years? What happened ten years ago that made you say that, Jeff?" The smaller, but muscular one asked, tilting up his head to get a better look of the brute, a puzzled look running deep in his steel blue eyes. Tugging at the collar of his stiff uniform, he paused and held out his hand to stop Jeff from walking any more. "You going to tell me or just look as confused as I am?"</p>

<p>"Of course I'm going to tell you, Darian. Though it'd be more fun if you just found out by surprise, which will probably happen sometime in the afternoon."</p>

<p>"Pardon?"</p>

<p>"The surprise, why I brought up ten years ago." Jeff started his stroll again, for a crowd of people was beginning to form around the two Firsts. Neither of the two saris liked being in the center of attention, though they constantly used the main roads to get places, so it was expected for them to be stopped. But together no one really dared to interfere, thinking that that would mean a night in the cells. A crowd of people with concerns, though, was brave enough to start to look questionably towards them as they picked their way down the road, pausing for yet another moment after some silence.</p>

<p>Darian was not too sure as to what the large one was getting at; a blank was drawing as he tried to remember something important ten years ago. Having no wife or children to worry about, most important dates were that of old fights or meetings that brought about change in the way of living, but nothing to bring up in an idle chat. Letting out a stiff blow of air at a chunk of hair that had slipped free of its bindings, the smaller sari man finally just shook his head in frustration. "Tell me, Jeff."</p>

<p>"Eh, I've got a meeting to get ready for," he stated quickly, a large smirk pulling at the corners of his mouth, catching even a glint of amusement in his dark eyes. "Meet me back at the Commons when you find out."</p>

<p>Darian bristled but kept his hands from swiping out at the Priest, a stiff chuckle of annoyance bursting from his lips. "Damn fool. Now I'll be nagged all afternoon to remember this."</p>

<p>That's the point." And Jeff turned on his heel and walked swiftly through the gathering crowd that had been trailing them, half-vanishing within them except for what foot stuck out over their heads.</p>

<p>Not bothering with following the quickly retreating Priest, Darian shrugged his shoulders and tried to blank his mind of the few moments of odd talk. Now alone, the crowd seemed to lessen, but there were still some younger boys and girls hovering a few yards behind him as he started to stroll off, heading towards the gate out of the city. Those were ones that were slightly interested in becoming prospect students with the Guard. And since he was the leader, the First of the Guard, he had the wonderful joy of the preening younglings almost every day. It was something he could tune out and walk away from, like now, for his mind was currently occupied with trying to remember the past.</p>

<p>The streets grew quiet as the children figured out that he was ignoring them and had tottered off elsewhere. Letting out a long yawn, he stretched his arms out wide then relaxed, hands tucking back in under the folds of his heavy winter's cloak. Autumn here never lasted long; the forests that surrounded the city made it so that northerly winds traveled quick and fiercely into its center where the city lay. A few curled and dried leaves from sidewalk planted trees bustled passed his boots and away down the cobbled road, bare branches shaking as the wind blew a bit more forcefully as the sun was slowly covered up by billowing clouds. Snow was more than likely to start falling soon, covering everything in a freezing blanket of white and blue shadows, and stopping life within the dark walled city for a while. He was looking forward to that, for that would signal the end of the year and the end of searching for fledgling apprentices to the Guards' unit. No more flocks of youngsters at his heels and watching from the corners of their eyes in hopes to catch his fleeting attention. And no more swooning girls to bat their eyelashes at him. Or at least he hoped with that, the winter keeping most but the Guards within homes.</p>

<p>Tired of hoping that it would snow that night, he returned his attentions inward again to trying to remember. Ten years ago was quite a ways back, and he had been just one of those silly fledgling runs dogging after the heels of the now dead First Captain of the Guard, Vanis. But that was all he could really recall that stuck out in the back of his head, being assigned his first duty of watch on a very chilly night, one that would determine if he wanted to stick through this career for the rest of his life. He had survived bristling chills of harsh winds and snow beating against his face, bundled up under a thick coat and some warm soup that had been stolen by a good friend of his, one who had some how surprised the entire city by becoming their First Priest. The ruler in a sense of all the saris within the walls of the city. Jeff had not survived that night at all, and had chickened out after just an hour of keeping watch on the high bridges that ran from tower to tower of the central Temple. Back to the kitchens he had gone and out once more minutes later with a mug of broth to warm Darian's belly. Somewhere on the mission back into the kitchens to sneak away from the freezing guard duty, Jeff must have had gotten intercepted by another Priest. Nothing else seemed to push its way out from his memories but that small moment, perhaps it was just something important to Jeff and not him.</p>

<p>Giving a shrug to himself, he noticed that he was at the gate to the city, the thick bars open to let in the day's traffic of saris from the fields back home. A few of his Guards stood there silently, straightening somewhat when they noted that he was there watching them with a critical eye. Dressed in dark brown, the normal city Guard were those who had given up with being out in the woods, either by wounding or by choice or order from him, and stuck to manning the inner town and the entrance gate. Green were out in the woods with bow and arrows, watching like hawks and swift as a deer to report news from the outer fringes of the forest back to the dead center and his ear. They were the Scouts, the more sought after position for it meant more dangers and 'heroic' actions from time to time. Darian hated it. He was much happier up on the bridges that connected the five towers with one another, five stories of tower and bridges, each with look outs searching the sky and forests for sign of invasion. It was also the spot where he was least bothered by the citizens, whom he did not generally hate, but rather just annoyed by their dull cries of injustice and petty crimes. The Priests handled the people, thankfully. He just had to deal with the elves and the swarms of goblins, not that he'd seen an elf since the last raid five years back. And goblins were easy to handle for they did not hawk back that they were being wrongfully tried, but rather died quickly with an arrow in the eye or a sword in the gut.</p>

<p>Looking over the two Guards, he gave a slight nod of his chin and moved off through the gate, in a mind to take a quick stroll down to meet up with the daily messenger that came out of the woods shortly. Usually the Scout would speak with a Guard at the gate and one of them would bring the report to him. But today, the city people were bothering him so he sought the relative silence of the outside. They were overly talkative and pestering and it was driving him insane with being caught up in the crowds. Jeff could handle them, and Darian was quite glad that he had him along on some of his walks through the market place to keep the crowd back. Two Firsts were nerve racking for the normal citizen, as if they were unsure how to approach two people of power.</p>

<p>He quickened his pace to nearly a jog when a smacking of freezing wind hit his body from the north, sending a few moments of chills running from head to toe and back up again. Shaking off the numbness in his face, he forced his legs to carry him along the granite road towards the crying angel statue. That bit of rock disturbed him, and every other sari in the city, jolting memories of the murder that started the breaking of the bond between the two most powerful races one the eastern half of the world. Averting his eyes as he drew nearer, looking off towards the distant forest he spotted a lone figure and a horse just emerging from the woods.</p>

<p>Nearly dropping his mouth wide open, he came to a tumbling halt right at the side of the statue and jumped back quickly, reflexes tight to years of training with the best Guards in the last century. Muttering some under his breath as he was forced to hide behind the dreaded statue, he quickly peeked around to see if the stranger had seen him. The small form was still just standing there, looking up at the sky, something that that person had not seen in quite some time for the forest had the strange ability to block out all light from hitting the ground. It was a savior, that trick of the living forest, for it kept away the other hostile races that sought out this hidden city, though it failed to keep out the small creatures, like the greedy goblins.</p>

<p>Watching the form as it just stood there in awe, he suddenly was hit with a thought. None of the Scouts had come to report a trespasser. Strange. Shaking his head, he squinted his eyes as if that would allow him to see a greater distance, but for naught. Still a blur and still not daring to move closer, he could not make out the person. If no one had come to warn him, then that meant either the messenger Scout was murdered and laying in the forest, or it was a lost sari and there had been no reason to quicken the delivery of the reports.</p>

<p>Or this one had managed to pass undetected through the forest.</p>

<p>But then, as he stayed back and watched from his hiding spot, the stranger looked back towards the forest, as if deciding if they should go back in and find their way to the beginning. In that moment, a Scout seemed to just materialized at the back of the person, stepping from the forest's edge in which he had been waiting in the shadows, a sword drawn and brought to the waist in warning. Apparently the messenger had not been killed, for that was he and so had just delayed his trip back to the city to wait for the stranger to clear the forest and arrest. He watched the other freeze and not dare to even look around as if they knew who was there already, the Scout grabbing for an arm and threatening even more with a dare to run the sword through the body. Making not a move, the captured one let the Scout lead them away from the overburdened horse, who then followed like a dog after its master.</p>

<p>Not waiting to be caught in hiding, he stepped around the angel and made his way off towards the Scout and prisoner, seeming as if he had just decided to take a respectful look at the statue. With both of them moving down the road towards one another hastily, it was not long before he saw that the stranger was female and covered in grim and blood as well. Red hair, the color of wild flames was tied back in a thick braid, though clumps had been freed by probably running into the many bramble bushes along the way through the forest. It framed her paled, and mud smeared face, sticking with dirt and appearing like streaks of dried blood. She was, as he drew even closer so that he could see that she was armed as well, struggling to rip herself free after glancing up with startled gold eyes towards Darian, spotting him. Outnumbered, she had grown a bit frantic as if just realizing she was trapped.</p>

<p>Annoyed that this slight woman had somehow managed to sneak passed all his Scouts and various traps, and knew of the way through, he snarled softly once just a few feet from her. Lifting his hand, which she of course tried to smack away as he reached for his face, he snapped out a vicious order with a growling voice. "Stand still, wench!"</p>

<p>Surprisingly, she obeyed with a bite on her tongue to keep from snapping back at him, her eyes narrowed with anger, but smart enough to realize that she would probably not win any fights she started. Her gold eyes frantically followed his hand as he reached forward again for her hair, yanking it free of her face and managing to draw back with a few snapped strands. Clearing up one side so that he could see properly, he let out another choked noise and stepped back, a curious look given towards the other sari Guard. That one glanced at her ear as well and jerked his hand off her upper arm as if she had suddenly become the fire her hair was suggesting she could be. The two men looked at each other, then back at her again, almost in shocked awe. They both recognized her, and she noted the looks as well and seemed to just want to shrink into her fur-lined cloak, fingers clutching it tightly around her slender body.</p>

<p>In the back of Darian's head a memory stirred that had been buried away with shame and anger and guilt. After a moment of just studying her with an almost feared look, a name came to the tip of his tongue. "Mialyn?"</p>

<p>_______________

<p>Yawning, Auno stretched. He reached back with his gracefully long hands and scratched a bothersome itch on his neck before it had the chance to spread all around and annoy him. Looking down at the ground with his white eyes glittering sleepily, he marked what had made the air so cold. Damning his magic that made him feel nothing touching him, though earlier the spell had seemed like a decent idea, he dug himself out of the foot deep pile of snow. There was a little disturbing tickle in the back of him mind, reminding him that snow this far south of the mountains should not have been due for at least another two or three months. Damn those elves, he thought. It was because of those twittering fools who thought themselves equal to the power of nature that this weather was screwed around too many times. Summer had been to damnably hot, and now this mess of cold wetness clotted into his clothes. And most likely in the next few days, it would be as blazingly intolerable again.</p>

<p>He hated frozen shirts and pants. Knowing that the river he had been sleeping next to was now frozen over, he dragged his fingers through the snow and scooped up a ball to suck on. Something behind him crunched through the snow.</p>

<p>"Still an animal, I see," came a rasping voice from the bushes, the feeling of eyes boring into the base of his neck. "I thought I had trained you better, Auno in'iska."</p>

<p>"Rennin," he growled deep in his throat, his hand unconsciously smashing his breakfast drink into small chunks. He pretended that the white snow was her bones, and he smiled slightly, lightening his mood somewhat. He ignored her insult, hating it when she reminded him of his mixed blood, something that was quite sneered upon with the two races he was breed out of. "What do you want?"</p>

<p>Branches parted on their own, pushed by magical wind and formed an arching entrance for the Sorceress's little sister to glide through. Her black boots barely touched the frozen ground. But, before she reached his side, she dropped to the ground heavily and frowned, her yellow wolf-like eyes raising accusingly to him. "I never tau-"</p>

<p>"Save it," he snapped out with a flick of his hand threateningly. "I'm not your slave anymore to bicker at. Or have you forgotten?"</p>

<p>Her painted red lips parted slightly, and she reached up to brush at loose silver strands from her high arched, elven face. Her cheeks, normally the cold shade of frozen white, was tainted pink from the cold. He smiled again at this, knowing that she lacked most of what he had been gaining over the passed months from those he drew power from. "I don't think that I'll ever forget, not even in death." She frowned at her memory of his breaking of her bonds, even when she had thought she had more power than he. "You know of Sister's Vendadra? Yes, you would, wouldn't you, after what they did to you . . . Anyway, she's bonded more Jangols to her, a Prince from Davenport, and a little boy. . . . Who I think will die shortly."</p>

<p>"Their names?" He eyed her warily. She did not know about the one who escaped? He mused to himself, trying to think of how to use his knowledge against the Three Sisters. "Maybe I've met them?"</p>

<p>"I think not," she muttered, her eyes still looking him over guardedly. "Jene and Lao. The first, the poor Princeling, lost his new bride a few weeks ago, just before my sister had found him. Though a good thing the girl had died, instead of living with an untrained Jangol, she would have had trouble breaking him. Sister took him in. I've seen him just moments ago, he belongs to her now. Not that you would fully understand since you broke with me before fully mine, you would have enjoyed it. I never seemed to be able to harness your darker magics, lovely boy." A dark smile lifted a corner of her thin mouth. She looked up at Auno with a mocking cast to her face. He was more relaxed then she, though how he could soaked to the bone and keep still without even a shivering? His hard angled face hinted at elven blood, but with a brutish look of facial hair, his other half from the humans forced its way out. The tips of his ears were pointed, but not as much as a full bloods would have been, and he kept them hidden constantly under his gold hair. It caused less trouble to appear human then a half-breed. Leaning closer in, too close for his liking, but he protested not, she ran her hand across his woolen vest and slipped her fingers under the thick winter cloth, scratching his disturbingly dry, smooth skin lightly with the tips of her nails. Angrily, she realized that he had 'eaten' some Wizard's power and gained his talents. Forcing a thick, sultry voice out of her throat, she muttered, "You were always my favorite. You don't want to come back? It's much better than living out here in the weather. Or do you live some place warm on other nights? In a bed?"</p>

<p>"Funny, Rennin. I know you better than you think, so stop trying to annoy me." He caught her chin in his grasp and lifted it to his face, until she was a colorless blur as if he was thinking of pasting a kiss against her dark lips. "Why did you come? And alone. You know I'm stronger and could easily take your energy."</p>

<p>"But, would you dare?"</p>

<p>"Depends on if I'm hungry enough." He paused and pulled out her roaming fingers before she went too far and actually accomplish some teases, holding them firmly in his larger hand to keep them away. She bothered him more then the annoying elves and their playing with the weather. "Why are you here?"</p>

<p>"I need your help, Auno," she muttered. Batting her lashes, she slipped her hand away from her side and raised it to his taunt, clenched jaw. "Will you help me?"</p>

<p>"With what?" he rasped gruffly, suddenly less bothered by her peskiness and more annoyed at the way she tried to lure him back into her powers.</p>

<p>"Jene is just a boy, not ready to be able to do what I had asked him to do-"</p>

<p>"So he's yours as well?" He watched her face darken slightly. It was not uncommon for the three witch sisters to share their brood of pets, though he was the special one for Rennin and luckily did not have to suffer with bouncing from bed to bed every night between the elves. Sighing, he asked, "What do you need help with?"</p>

<p>She watched him steadily as her other hand glided over his ear, tracing the outline of the shape. Suddenly, she pinched the tip, making him hold in a growl of pain and he turned a bit to make a snap for her fingers with his teeth, missing as she jerked backwards. Elfish ears, whether Jangol or not, were sensitive to the touch, and anything with pressure behind it caused un-pleasurable discomfort. "He's going to look for the sarian Wizardress and keep her at bay until I find that Star of Auras'sie, but I don't think he'd be able to keep the Wizardress occupied someplace else. Can you?"</p>

<p>"Are you sure a sari?" he asked, doubtful she had meant a sari, then to just rile her blood to a nice boil, his voice changed to one of a teacher lecturing. "I've never heard of a full-blood sari having the ability of magic, let alone be strongly willed enough to tackle the training to become a Wizardress. Besides, saris hate the elves. So do I."</p>

<p>"So then she is an elf, hmm?" she thought out loud. "This might become interesting. She lives in No Samatory, or at least did for some time. In fact, she's just returned from a ten year exile."</p>

<p>"Done some homework? You're looking dangerous, Rennin. What is it that you need help with? Surely it's more then just dealing with the girl," he growled. She looked up at him with a thin, hopeful smile. "And don't think that I'll become yours again."</p>

<p>"Come with me to No Samatory, Auno Talle. My Sister's boy won't be a problem, nor my power-hungry Sister. We have to find that Staff Dabane's been musing about for centuries." Her eyes glittered as if she was staring into the depths of the crystal at that moment.</p>

<p>"What if I say no?" he ventured for conversation.</p>

<p>"You, my dearest Auno," she hissed. "Have no say in this matter."</p>

<p>He jerked his head up a bit from staring at the frozen water from some time, lips pulling into a sneer. Baring his teeth like a feral animal, he pushed himself to his feet in order to look down at the short elf, needing to have a bit of a feeling of over-riding power at the moment. With a voice that hinted upon her strangulation, he whispered down to her, "didn't I just say that you had no control over me? And here you are, telling me that my participation is ordered."</p>

<p>"And here you are sleeping out in the freezing cold."</p>

<p>"That doesn't matter at the moment, Rennin, what does is the fact that you don't own me any longer and need to get that out of your head."</p>

<p>"Apparently you didn't understand what I had meant," she snapped back with a flick of her hand up towards his towering form. "Even if you said yes, you'd never have say with what is to be the plan with what I am attempting to do."</p>

<p>"Then why not just say that from the start, instead of trying to rile me up? It's as if you were trying to be the Jangol and not I."</p>

<p>Laughing softly under her breath, she stretched her arms out eyes glittering with an intensity that sent a few shivers down his back. Calmly she tugged at the folds of her dress to pull the hem of her dress up out of the layering of snow on the ground, then finally looking off towards some far off point on the horizon, she answered him. "And by me getting you riled up saves me from you feeding off of my emotions. Remember who taught who here." Pausing to let that little bit of insult to pile up to her name calling from moments ago, she gave him a grin that matched the greed in her eyes. "Now. Are you going to help me or bicker about if I still want you as a pet?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'd love to just continue a nice spat with you." His white eyes rolled in their sockets, voice a sarcastic tone. And since she had brought up the fact about feeding, he was starting to feel a bit hungry. So why not just try and egg her on a bit more, just to see if he could possible get some dinner before being tricked into working for the witch sister. Though she'd know if he tried to do anything to her, no matter how subtle of a move, for she had been right. She did train him in the art of being what he was. "Or do you really have to go to that sari town this minute?"</p>

<p>"I'm giving them a day to sit around and for Mialyn to stir up some trouble, then send in a Shifter."</p>

<p>"One of those?" he snarled softly, suddenly not wanting to have anything to do with this plan of hers any longer. Those creatures drove him to near insanity with their lunacy and mindless programmed way of getting the job done. "Why am I needed if you're sending a Shifter to take care of things?"</p>

<p>"If you wish to take care of a Wizardress all by your lonesome, then tell me now before I waste Crenger's time in getting one made."</p>

<p>"Why couldn't you have told me before I started thinking that this plan might actually work. You know that those monsters drive me up the wall, and yet here you are babbling away and throwing one in just at the last moment." He cut her words off with a swipe of his hand in a pulled hit for her face, just to shut her mouth before she interrupted. "I'll still go, Renning. But, here me now. If that Shifter botches up one thing, I'm curtailing it back to some unknown corner of the world where you'll never be able to find me again. Got it?"</p>

<p>Tilting up her chin, the elf looked as if she was about to send a wad of spittle into his eyes. "Of course, dear."</p>

<p>He strongly resisted the urge to bring his hand back down to contact flesh to flesh; the witch needed a good slapping at this moment, her haughtiness egging on his foul temper. Instead he lifted his hand to run through his mane of hair, pushing it back to catch behind the slightly pointed ears of his half-breed elven blood. Once more he was reminded just why he had broken himself free of her magic lacing, quite glad that this woman was not pulling the strings any longer. Bluntly, she was just an old spoiled brat with the power to get her almost all of what she desired, and she was youngest of the three witches and the least experience. But he had one hell of a time trying to change around the idea of who ran whose life. Giving her one of his annoying blank stares, one that got the reaction he hoped for-a soft snarling growl from the back of her throat, quite an unlady-like noise if he could say so-he finally broke his momentary lapse from speaking. "Then why exactly am I needed?"</p>

<p>"I'll let you know when the time comes." She eyed him again, relaxing herself from making dodges away from his threatening swats to her delicate cheek.</p>

<p>"You don't know, do you?" he chuckled, a smirk playing at the corners of his thin, pale lips and even his white eyes like that of a blind man glinted of some slight humor at her ill planning.</p>

<p>"I told you already, Auno. Did you forget so soon?"</p>

<p>"The talk wavered away from the original intent, so yes."</p>

<p>"Just occupy that bitch from creating too much trouble before my other plans with her get started. And no, I won't tell you of what I'm thinking about, so don't bother."</p>

<p>His smirk grew just a bit wider. "You don't know." </p>

<p>____________

<p>No Samatory stood erect in the center of a forest that spanned from edge to edge of one of three Nations of Teirn, a blackened mar in lush green. It could be seen from a distance, if one strained to search the horizon while perched on a rocky cliff in the mountains. Just a small mark of black before the sea reached out to stop the expansion of the forest. A river from that sea roamed around the city like a wide moat of dangerous undertows and murky waters, then wandered off into the forest and traveled to the heart of the monstrous green land where it dwindled away to nothing. It was an island of sorts, three sides cut out by the river, the forth being the sea itself, and No Samatory spread itself out on that entire bit of land. Large walls that stood taller then fifty men and thicker then the same amount wrapped itself around the edge of the island, save for where a moderately sized port butted out into the sea. The walls were of black granite, lifeless and black, darker then the night sky when none of the three moons were hovering in the air. They seemed to suck in the light itself and never reflect it back out as marble did. It was just there. As was the Temple that squatted in the middle of the city, rising five stories without including the spires that pierced the sky. There was the main building of fancy carvings for decoration and then six towers that climbed upwards like groping fingers for the heavens. From each floor of those towers there were bridges that ran between all the towers, the top most keeping the snow on its surface weeks after all other bits of winter had faded. Men and women in stiff uniforms and armed with lances that doubled as lanterns during the night walked the bridges, eyes trained upon the city or out towards the borders of the forest. Vigilant and loyal to their home, they suffered the harsh winters that left feet of snow on the ground and winds that threatened to blow them from their lofty battlements. Within the walls of the Temple, safe from the harsh life outside, the Priests of the city worshiped and prayed and prophesied, the latter bringing them concerns for the future almost daily. Those concerns in turn were offered up to the goddess of the moon, Sei'sa, who only answered with more puzzlement for them to fret over.</p>

<p>Outside of the city was the ring of angels, all screaming silently to the same goddess for mercy that had never been granted to them. Each was the exact copy of the next, though the names for each were different. Their death the same, granted by the same hand. Each disturbed almost every sari within No Samatory to where they drew back and hide, passing laws and forbidding traditions. And cut themselves off from the very race that had gave them existence in the first place, though brought death to them without a question asked or reason given. Magic, after the breaking of the bond between the elves and the saris, was outlawed a moment after the War that had done the cutting had finished. Within fifty years of that law being passed, the magic was breed out of the sari race completely so that never again was something so tainted brought into their lives. Their walls had grown, not only in this one city, but all the others-though smaller-settlements, protecting them from everything. Sometimes beasts came from the forests to batter at their defenses, giving the Guard something to practice against, but never another soul that was not of sari blood. Or so they had believed.</p>

<p>Mialyn's eyes of purest gold were lifted to regard her old home, though not her real home. There had been other places where she had lived, another place where she had been born. It had not been No Samatory, she only came there within the arms of an elf Wizard, both disguised by the outlawed magic to seem as the sari people. Then she had been but a child of ten or so, not understanding what was going on, why she had left her old home back in the elven Nation, why she had been hushed into revealing who she was with threats of death. She never really felt at home within the city, not even after spending a good majority of her life hiding her real self from all around, even from the family that had taken heart at seeing her on their doorstep. For now she could not look else where, not at the two Guards that were leading her to the gate, nor at the forest or the angels as she passed them by. The blackness and massive structures were making her remember things that she had hoped to never draw out of the back of her mind.</p>

<p>Quickly she shook her head to clear out the memories before she fell into a Dreaming, something that would make her fall unconscious for some unknown amount of time, and with two Guards at her side, it was a risk she could not chance. Giving a glance off to her right, to the one that had said her name out loud with a look of shock in his eyes, she let out a faint sigh and dropped her gaze, not wanting any more attention. But for some reason, she could not recall him at all, and he had refused to speak his name to her. It was like she was being tested, and she had a dreadful feeling that he doubted who she was. Wondering if he was able to see through her disguise, she mere shrugged her shoulders to her own thoughts, ignoring any looks shot in her direction. They were silent, and so was she with lips sealed in a thin line as if annoyed at her treatment.</p>

<p>Reaching the bridge that crossed over the river, the one that had caught her stopped dead, and shoved some paper into the other's hand. "I can take her from here." </p>
