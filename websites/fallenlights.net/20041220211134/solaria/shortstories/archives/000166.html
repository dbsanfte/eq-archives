<br>
<br>Telliani<br>

<br>

<p><p>Telliani slipped down the path of dried leaves and roots, the boots of soft leather whispering silently as if a deer leaving the forest to graze in the field. Her black cloak was laced tightly down her body, hiding her clothes in the darkness she traveled through, the cowl of black wool shadowing her face and dampening the glow of her white hair. The material swirled with the wind as it pushed her, tripping her when it snagged burrs and winding around her legs, but that--the movement--was not a bother for if anyone looked up now as she walked, no skin would keep her from sight. She just wanted to keep her elven face hidden until she was sure that the town she strode straight for was friendly to her kind. As well as keeping her cursed sword from prying eyes. The slivers of silver--her daggers of pure magik--were never seen upon her body, as they were buried in herself and never visible until she called them forth and by then it would be too late to get out of their sight. So, it was her blade of blue powers, unfriendly and quite visible to the naked eye, that was the reason for her to be clothed in the black cloak. And, from what she had witnessed from her perch the night before, some of the patrons to this Red Dragon Inn wore the knight's look. Bloody, deadly assassins and other-kind, those that never were meant to live in the light, moved easily about the Inn, seemingly harmless and ignored by the common folk who bought their mead and sup for the night. It was strange to her, these trusting commoners, for she would if seeing one of these others scream and flee. These three types were the ones to hide their truer forms and hid their purpose. And so shall she, for until she could be sure of the temperament of others, she was outside the ease of the commoners' minds and that meant ill for her comings and goings. </p></p>

<p><p>So she descended rapidly if one considered mortal travel quick--flickering her eyes around with ease and patience as she neared the lights glowing fiercely on the stucco creme walls. The trees were thin, young, and widely spread from each other at the end of the path, the lake a shimmering spot in the distance. Dirt underfoot was worn to a pol-ished hue that picked up the moon's glaring face, causing it to faintly shine as if marble. She paused un-der the sign, and glanced at it as it swung noisily in a breeze. A dragon depicted in faded, chipped paint decorated the wood, which had been grayed by age under the harshness of the sun's light. </p></p>

<p><p>"Lovely ain't it?" came a soft voice behind her, just over her shoulder. She jumped, her hands instinc-tively clutching her sword under the cloak. The black eyes noted this and when they brushed back to her gaze of surprise, there was a dark understanding buried within. So the form, a male by the deepness of the voice, only nodded and stepped back a pace, giving her the room to draw if need held her to do so. She waited for him to yank out one of the blades she knew he had, for she had seen this darkened creature on the previous night. Instead of issuing a spar, he bowed, spreading his hands wide to show that they were empty, but in the same fluidness, revealing the daggers and two katanas strapped to his narrowed waist, as well as two daggers belted to his legs above the boots. She was quite certain that he had others pocketed else where, for he had that look of getting into too many scraps that involved trickery to save his life. His solid gaze held hers as he straightened, a smirk on his carved face of the Highe blood of her kind glaring all too fully out in the open. And, as he drew closer, she scowled and kept her hands at her side far from dropping her cowl, not revealing herself as was custom. He marked this as well, and she was beginning to become annoyed, her foul mood strengthening each time he caught and stored every one of her hidden, un-trusting habits she had picked up over the years of travel in non-Highe lands. Then, he spoke again, still with the same fluid, low voice. "You have no need to hide from those within, unless. . . . If you did have a just cause, then everyone here will mark you as an enemy, and I trust that this wouldn't be what you want." His thin mouth pulled into a smirk, and again she scowled, swearing silently to herself to be rid of this company. "And to hide such a lovely face, ?tis a pity. For most will find a pleasure with just a glance." And with that he moved passed her smoothly, twisting the brass knob to enter the Inn. Pushing the door with its whining squeal of protest he entered the bright lair of drinks and brawls, but then paused, his searching gaze upon her face again. "Won't you come in? I offer the company, though, if you prefer to feast alone, I will not stop you." </p></p>

<p><p>She glared at him, mainly from his comment of pleasure, when she had deadened looks, not believing his bluntness, but then shrugged it away and stepped into the Inn, darting under his arm that held back the door, her eyes glancing up at his downward half smile. Sliding around him, she straightened and dug her hands on her hips as she searched the room, taking in each of the patrons with a quick, disapproving look. No one noticed the two, not even a frozen, hard glare at the fact that at least he was of Highe blood. They did not see her truths since she was still shadowed within her blackness, though not even that hid her Highe blood, just catching her eyes were enough. </p></p>

<p><p>Then she felt a touch on her shoulder, shattering her concentration, and she shuddered as she whirled around her eyes snapping with light and power. It only brought out another amused grin to the otherwise emotionless face from the gray elf; she realized the more she studied his smirking face that he was not of Highe-royal as she originally thought. This gave her another chill, for being from the highest of the Highe blood she could not stand those of lower status, for just the thought of commoners made her skin . . . crawl. He noticed her disdain with a clouding flicker in his piercing stare, then backed away, dropping his hand from the motion of removing the cowl from her head. Whirling smoothly and without a word uttered, he turned his back to her and moved to the bar in the corner. She watched him move about with an empty glass in hand for a moment, then set her eyes to the task of searching for an empty table. There was only one left, and by the time she noted it, the gray one was heading for it. Sucking in a breath of fouled air of smoke and Man smells, she instead turned to the bar with a sigh and her shrouded form a shade in the light of the crowd glided forward. As she perched herself on a stool, she scowled suddenly. There was no bartender. </p></p>

<p><p>"What bloody place be this if there is no one here to serve?" she hissed under her breath. In truth, she had not even seen where the other elf received his goblet of red wyne from, for she had been searching for a table. Sighing, she raised her slender, pale hands; fingers wrapped around her cowl, dropping it from her head. As her long, silvered hair fell down her back, her fingers were at work with unlacing her cloak, at least to loosen the fabric, for with a blaze the size of a forest fire in the crowded room, one could not be chilled. She still had no luck with finding a bartender by the time she had folded her cloak into a square. This made her mood plummet more. So, she dropped her head into the harsh fabric of her cotton sleeves and sighed deeply and to mope and dwell on her current problems with the realization of the cursed blade's true purpose. She could not think of another way . . . </p></p>

<p><p>"You," she growled as she jerked straight, her eyes raising along the shape of the elf who had stolen her table and now currently was preparing to sit besides her at the bar. Without an explanation or apology, he reached into a cupboard and drew out a blue goblet of simple, but thick glass. </p></p>

<p><p>"Just think of what you wish to drink," he explained, his smooth voice dark, but without the last hints of humor. She gave the elf a glare, then sniffed, dropping her gold gaze on the cup clutched in her hands. Slowly, a liquid too purple to be a true black, but too thick to be just violet, filled the glass. He watched amused; his twitching smile stilled for once. "Interesting," he drawled, "what should that drink be, milady?" </p></p>

<p><p>Her body stiffened, just as she was beginning to relax, and she managed to rise to her feet and draw back from him; her eyes frozen in his, and her hand twitching for her blade. She left her drink untouched on the counter. "Do not call me that, elf." She spit out the word ?elf' as if it was a curse, treating him like the underling he truly was. Lifting her chin defiantly, she stormed away, her stride heavy and quick, to the empty table had vacated. She knew he would follow is was just a feeling--so when she raised her gaze from the stained wood and up passed his chest to his stern gaze, she was not surprised that he actually stood there, and not a tempered illusion from her mind. "What is it, elf?" </p></p>

<p><p>"Why is this elf word you use so different then when I say elf?" he asked with calmed puzzlement as he caught the back of a chair and turned it so that he straddled the seat, using the back as an armrest. "And I suppose that you should at least know my name, after all that I have offered you." </p></p>

<p><p>"Offered me?" she scoffed. Her look darkened, and slim, arched brows of silver darting higher, an evil smirk on her face, tempting danger. "You offer me annoyance to my already failed day. There should be no name to the one that has annoyed me to time's end." </p></p>

<p><p>He held out a callused hand in her direction anyway, a determined look in his eye, then leaned forward slightly, and whispered, "Dantrag." </p></p>

<p><p>"Damn it, elf. I did not wish to hear that," she spat harshly, her eyes picking up the firelight so that they stung with heat. She ignored his hand completely, which he finally dropped. Scowling again, she leaned back in her chair, and drew up one leg to wrap her elbow around. Suddenly her goblet was before her, causing him to twitch slightly back, though not as much as she had thought he would when she used her magik. Catching up the drink, she took a deep sip and sighed, her mood seemingly lightened in her eyes. Then, she muttered, "Blackthorne." </p></p>

<p><p>"Strange, but interesting name, m'la-" He cut himself off, remembering her reaction to the first time. "How did you come about such a name? If I dare to ask?" </p></p>

<p><p>She cawed out a ringing laugh, letting her head tilt back, and unconsciously running her hand through her silvered hair so that it glittered from the blaze. Letting out her peal of giggling, she slapped her hand on the wood and winced at the sting and shut her mouth, though her golden gaze--when it fell back into his--shone with the bottled laughter. "Elf, that is what my answer to your first question be." Then she clarified for his puzzled look. "This be a drink from home, Blackthorne wyne. I just am Telliani, though Tell or Telli suit me as well. Take a pick, elf." </p></p>

<p><p>"But first call me by something other than ?elf', lady. You say it as if I am lower than you, when in truth I hold more status." </p></p>

<p><p>"Then an heir to the Throne of the Northern Empire?" She cackled again, her darkened mood vanishing with each intake of breath. "How can this be? Only my brother, the Crowned Prince has call over what I say to others, or how I address them. And lucky for you that he is not here. Come, now. Your surely are jesting?" </p></p>

<p><p>He shook his head, the glint in his eyes proving that he will not peel as easily as she commanded. "Just believe that I am. Though, I will keep this hidden until the time is for you to know." </p></p>

<p><p>She rose, letting her gaze drift from his for a moment and glinting to the rafters, which she had perched on the night past. Parting her lips, she whispered, "Then until that time, I shall go delve in the shadows by myself. Fortunate for you, I have not listed you as one of annoyance, or you might find yourself gushing blood at my feet." And on that sour note, she vanished from sight with a simple twist of her hand. </p></p>

<p><p>She shadow-walked out of invisibility on the rafters, coming into sight faintly at first, then completely herself in this world. Her boots hissed across the splintered wood, sometimes catching the soles and giving her a wobble of her otherwise cattily calm stride. She settled at the other end, under a crossbeam that jutted diagonally from the wall, a support for the floor above. Curling down into the corner, she crouched, one arm straight to support her body as she peered down over everyone. She watched, with head bowed, so that silver hair framed her face of ice with a soft, downy glitter created from the flickers of the flames. Golden light passed over each patron, though not the elf, for she kept--forced--her stare from him. Which was strange, for before, when it came time to hunt, she had never divided those she knew from strangers. But, it was a feeling that she had to stay away from him. At least until she could judge his pretended skills better then what he seemed to let on. He could just be bluffing to add to an already exploding ego. So she looked for an easier target, one that others seemed to ignore steadfastly. One that would give her feed, but not trouble from everyone else. </p></p>

<p><p>One wire muscled leg drew up under her, giving her an easy grasp to the hilt of her sword, that had started it mewing for hunger. She wished that stroking the cold blade would be enough, but it had been too long since the last dip in blood had spattered over her clothes and face. The stains on her tunic were black with age, and she felt pity rise for not keeping her sword well groomed and feed. </p></p>

<p><p>And, as her eyes accidentally brushed back, Dantrag was in her vision, and she paused her roaming for no reason other then to just study him. He was leaning back, and in deep conversation with a smaller Man, who sat in robes and ale in hand, taking sips continuously. This other one seemed to not be alarmed by the presence of so many weapons that the gray one wore, as she had earlier. But, then she had reasons for being worried about armament. </p></p>

<p><p>In this she failed to keep her promise to herself. Since she centered on him for too long of a gaze, her sword's grasp took hold of her mind, twisting her into its need to draw blood, and she stood. Gracefully, with warriors' movement, with her catish fluidity adding to her training, she seemed to melt up to her feet, no sharp jerks to rise. Quickly, she fingered her long hair into a tight braid to keep it from her face. Her gold eyes flickered, and blinked away, slinking back into the lurk. </p></p>

<p><p>He was standing by the time she shadow-walked before him, and he took a small step back, one for balance at the sudden appearance of her. The glare she gave him was harsh, as was her breathing, deep and ragged in her lungs, and she felt as if she could burn holes through his clothes and skin. But, before she could draw her sword, she screamed in pain. Her voice was high pitched and sent shivers down everyone's body as she contorted; her eyes rolling until only the whites were visible. Fire, searing with thousands of torturing gashes ripped through her skull, and she dropped to the floor, her hands tugging on her hair as if that would get the pain from her head. She slid her eyes up at those ignoring her and uttered another scream of agony that left her choking for air. </p></p>

<p><p>The touch of a hand sent her reeling away, her voice cracking as she hissed, "Don't you touch me! Get away!" Her eyes were blue with fear and light of the sword, which now had full control of her actions. She shrank into a ball, clutching her legs against her chest, then she blinked and was gone from sight. </p></p>

<p><p>The blade was out when she returned from the shadows, sucking in the light of the fire, and her body. Drawing more than she could handle, it pulled fiercely at her powers, using it for its control over her. She kept her eyes on Dantrag, and her teeth bit down on her lips as she tried once more to take its hunger out on someone else. He would bring others down upon us, she cried to the blade, but it clawed back, its sharpened nails digging again into her mind, sending her staggering back into a pole. Clutching it, she looked up, and something sparked. </p></p>

<p><p>"You are drinking MY wyne!" she screamed, her voice blood thick with rage that now coursed through her lithe body and she flicked at his goblet with her taunt fingers. When he lowed his eyes to the goblet a frown spread on his mouth, and the blackness returned. Annoyed, he looked sharply at her, but with a faint glimmer of concern for her sudden temperament hidden deep in his eyes. She howled with fury at his insolence towards her. Another flicker of her stiffened hand that did not curl around the hilt of her sword. It hissed into her head, pouring hate and lust for killing, burying her deep in the need to strike at him. Raising her hand slowly, tables and chairs were shoved by her force, a rippling of wind slamming into the wood, giving her room to attack. The one who had been chatting with the gray elf backed up behind her, thinking it be best to leave the two at it alone. She ignored him; the sword's call was for the elf. </p></p>

<p><p>And the elf was hers. </p></p>

<p><p>He put down the goblet and moved from the bar, rolling his sleeves, and as he did, she called out her slivers, not ever finding it an issue with her adversary to warn them to spar. For rarely was the hunger of her blade satisfied with a ?polite' fight to the death. It liked savageness. And that was what she had to give it, or else suffer for a weak in deafening ranting of light and sound. </p></p>

<p><p>Five sprang from her palm, daggers of silver light streaking though the air, chilling it as they whirled at him. He ducked and skipped to the side, as if already anticipating the attack. Though, he did not know that what he had done was what she had expected him to do, for she was already upon him as the slivers dug their clawing grasp into the wall, a dagger in hand as she slammed into his broader chest. Out of surprise did he fall, not from her impact, and she pressed her dagger deep on his neck, starting to draw blood. </p></p>

<p><p>A strong hand caught her throat, without squeezing her life away, lifted her off his chest. In an instant later, she found herself slamming heavily with the wall. Letting out a shudder of breath, she dropped to the ground, rolled and sprang back at him, aiming her foot for his neck this time. The sword still pumped energy to fill her. </p></p>

<p><p>As she kicked out at him, she was blown back into the hard wall by a gush of steaming air. Her eyes pried up at the other one, the one Dantrag had been talking to as she paced the rafters, noting that his hands were raised in a defensive position. But, for a strange reason, his aim was not at her. Maybe her mind was to clogged with killing the elf to realize that this other thought that Dantrag was the one attacking her. </p></p>

<p><p>"Leave her be," the other spoke, his voice calm. "I gave you one warning." </p></p>

<p><p>Instead of backing down as the Man thought he would, the elf, from his reclined position just sent a blackened light at the other, a grin on his face. It was like a wall of solid burning air, one that she felt from the opposite side of the sending. </p></p>

<p><p>"Stay out of this," he growled up at the Man, and to her shock, with a voice that made him sound as if he wanted to fight her. </p></p>

<p><p>Taking her next chance, she started to lunge for Dantrag's neck, and again was interrupted by the other. Growling as two blades were shot towards her head, her eyes narrowed as her attention was shifted to him. Tightening her grasp on her sword she sheathed it and whirled around to pluck the daggers from the wood, then spun back on the toe of her foot, her arm extending in a blurred motion of liquid. One was sent at him and nicked his arm as he dodged the blade. Panicked, he glared at her and spoke into her mind. ~ That was for you. To help. ~ </p></p>

<p><p>She clenched her mind shut, blocking out his thoughts and him from sight totally. Her mind was now set on killing the elf still reclined on the floor. The last blade she fingered, then leapt at him again. This time she landed before him, at his head so that she looked at him up-side-down--if she were in her good mood, she would laugh at the sight--and brought the dagger down on him fast. It was stopped, jarring her teeth, and pushed back by a long dagger in his hand. As he concentrated on removing the blade from her hand, she drew her blue sword and slipped its cold touch on his neck. "Now to just let it slide," she muttered her eyes locked by his, a small smile on her paled lips. "And I can go back to wanting to die." </p></p>

<p><p>Again she found herself flying. This toss was aimed away--thankfully--from the wall, so she had time to right herself and land with her feet on a table. She caught her balance quickly, and turned to face him, who had finally risen to his feet, having enough of being pounced. </p></p>

<p><p>She had enough of waiting for him to die. How he did that to her, chucking her about as if she was just a feather? Never would she find out, for the next instant she was glowing brightly, the sword finally giving into her powers, adding its store to hers. In order for her to return the favor by feeding it with death. "I warned you," she muttered, her eyes blinded with blue light, which sparked off her pale hands, coating her entire body in a dusting of electricity. </p></p>

<p><p>"Warned me?" His brow raised with an amused glimmer, but he drew one of his katanas. He held her gaze. "About what? That you enjoy tickling others?" </p></p>

<p><p>If glowing eyes could darken to black, hers did at that moment. She seemed, as her powers grew, the brightness of the air around her was absorbed into her skin, blinding her sight for a moment as well. "That if you annoyed me. . . ." She held out her free hand, fingers extended to their fullest stretch. A ball of luminescent power grew and surged forward at him. </p></p>

<p><p>"Lady Telli," he spoke softly, his eyes not dangerous as they had been a moment later. The mass of energy that she had stored and calculated, flickered away, darkening the room once more. "Halt." </p></p>

<p><p>"No." She tried once more. This globe was just as unsuccessful as the last. Growling, she took a step forward. "I cannot until you are dead." </p></p>

<p><p>He paused a moment, then to her darkened surprise, tilted back his head and laughed. . . . <br /><br />
