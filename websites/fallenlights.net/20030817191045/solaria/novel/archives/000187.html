<br>Jangol<br>

<br>

<p>The world was a simple darkness.</p>

<p>One that was filled with a dank smell of dust and the light, hardly noticeable taste of liquor on everything edible. But only to him, sitting in the blackest corner of the of the Tavern Knockers as possible, the table with a view of everyone else, not a scenery that would come from the filmy windows. The taste was in the air as he ran the tip of his pink tongue over crackled, bone dry lips, almost making him shiver in pain at the sudden touch of salvia on the wounded flesh. The wine, on the other hand, made him shudder internally to keep onlookers from glancing his way repeatedly. He kept up the self inflicted torture of burning nerves only because his tongue needed to sustain some lubrication his body could not offer.</p>

<p>Tables were haphazardly strewn about, as if a summer storm had just recently swept it's corse down the middle of the room. A few chairs lay on their side, tossed back when angered individuals had stood to beckon a fist fight. Dents from such brawls were marked on the walls where swords had chipped into the already faded, cracked paint. The wooden support posts that held the second floor up off patrons heads were marred as well, a few newer nicks readable by a fresh color of red wood, not yet stained black with aged blood. A waitress hurried away from a table, ignoring the lewd comment about her proportions and plans on meeting her once her shift was done. Hurried into the kitchen to bring back an ale so that the comments grew harsher, leaning more towards the side where violence would build up instead of just words.</p>

<p>Again he felt a glance right after he had murmured in faint pain. His own, strangely silver eyes searched quickly for the one that yet again had been able to make hair jump about screaming with a warning. And like the last time, his search brought up nothing, not even one suspect to the unwarranted glance. Still looking around, his hand curled around the dampened goblet, lifting to cracked lips. Abhorring this place with a passion, the only reason he strayed in this direction was because he was low on energy, and the inn was a fine place to gather the needed emotions without any confrontations. At least ones that he did not stir up. Let the other patrons be the ones to feed you to your fill, a stray thought that just wandered his way into his mind from an ancient teachings. He just gave up, letting a stiff chuckle pass through his lips and into the upturned goblet, hiding that as well from the hearing of others.</p>

<p>Around him mingled elves and humans, all from outside towns that supported the farming communities, none bearing regal, over-aired looks, or hustled around by servants with cheap accents. No, these were all the sturdy folk with lives of troubles and means to live off the land, not ones that preyed on others, such as himself and the snooty Kaldean elves that believed they ruled the world. The air started to fade from the tinge of alcoholic beverages to that of sweat and anger, making him lift his eyes from the coppery liquid he had so willingly gulped down. A long smile carved its way onto his pale, lanky face; colorless eyes snapping around with a sudden vividness, searching for the cause of the change in temper. Believed to be arising from the small, huddled group of humans in a corner to his left, the pale man tilted his head to gaze in that direction, still with un-noted movement. They would not see him truly until he was ready to cast the beginning of a spell, to ignite his powers into feeding from the emotions he craved. He saw a flash of red heat suddenly burst from one black-haired human's self, as if exploding with fresh rage. Leaning back in his creaking chair, he waited til the colors in the air shimmered white, the perfect moment to begin drawing in sustenance. Humans tended to be the easiest to prey upon, quick to love and hate and sadden at a snap of a finger, and stupid enough to let the emotions rage and rant out of their control.</p>

<p>Perfect for one such as he. One of a few.</p>

<p>And to keep it that, he intended to never be a Sire, as one or two of his kind have done before. Ones that raised families to keep the populace up. Well, there was really no need for that. He and the others were practically indestructible, ones that would not be leaving the planet as dead, or at least not for an uncountable amount of ages from now.</p>

<p>Attention was suddenly snapped back to the humans that now were heatedly growling at one another, hands thumping onto the dusty table, drinks spilling over the edge and pooling in amber darkness around their heavy work-boots. Something that they tended to do quite often when intoxicated. Sure, he drank to some extent, but not in public, and especially not on days that he was thirsting for another form of substance; emotions. And they spewed forth a great deal of it in places such as taverns, or balls?-if he had been in a larger, richer city?-and even in the middle of the day when the hawkers were out screaming for attention. Things grew quite heated then. So here he was, waiting for the auras around the patrons to grow dead white, waiting for them to even begin fighting, for that would make it a hundred times easier to cast his spell, absorb the over-spilling emotions, and leave with a filled belly.</p>

<p>He jumped in his chair slightly, body tensing and he let out a faint growl before noting that it was only the serving wench out to collect his mug or money if he was leaving. Flipping a few coppers in her general direction, he muttered with a bland, low purr back at her to be off, that he'd be leaving in a few moments. And no. He would not want anything else to help empty out his purse, especially a room here. The place was a rat's warden, suitable for the under-class and the predator that visited on occasion. A few strands of limp, jet black hair suddenly flopped into his pallid eyes, until his boney hand lifted and swept it back into it's proper place, laced with other strands that were hooked under his slightly pointed ears. He had the look of one that traveled, a stray that happened to wander into a town. The clothing he wore was for the heavy roads and brambles, thick and serviceable, and all of the deepest shadow tint, even darker then dark. Just realizing that he was leaning forward, resting his weight on his elbows and eyes boring into the foggy air that clung desperately to the angered humans, he coughed and shoved himself forcefully back to lounge in the rickety chair, muttering impatiently. If they broke up, he'd have to leave, dallying in such a place sober was not wise for his body's health. At this level of intoxication, they would be at a berserker rage if they caught him glaring at them like a starved wolf, tongue dripping saliva from his parted, cracked lips. He did not need bruises, just their emotions.</p>

<p>Suddenly one of the men leapt up and out of the way of a flying fist, catching the attack with his cheek, and he sat up straight, eyes now eagerly waiting for the emotional auras to flare up excitingly. But, as he did so, the one that had been attacked, merely gathered what belonging he had?-a coat with grim on the back--and took himself out of the contest of brute force. He growled out viciously as his meal just up and left without coming close to being ready for feeding and stood up as well, intending to follow and absorb what little he could. His eyes remained focused on the departing man, watching the muscles in his back tense up with annoyance, probably because he had been remembering exactly why the heated up, though unfinished fight had started. Slipping out into the shadows of the night's air, he drifted along silently, wishing that he had a spare casting besides the one to draw up the emotions left to toss on the individual.</p>

<p>This was going to get messy. Now the only way for him to feed on this one in particular was to manual piss him off. A slim hand flipped a long knife into view as he waited to see which alley the slightly drunken fool would stumble into. In one way, the idiot had some brains, leaving before he got himself into beaten into a bloodied pulp by the four other drunks, but on the other hand, he might be leaving for home even more mindless once his emotions were taken. Some times. Just sometimes, the victim was too stubborn to yield him what he needed, and force was the only way to retract the sustenance. A force that would rend the prey's mind useless and soggy for weeks. Bedding him in a house to recover, sending the rest of the family that lived on his wages to scurrying around, searching for grub.</p>

<p>So they would have to starve for a week or two, he murmured into his own thoughts, they probably had this problem once before, seeing how that drunk acted like a regular in the tavern.</p>

<p>Grumbling under his breath as he slipped along, eyes alert on every shadow, searching to make sure that they were alone on the street, he suddenly paused, a faintly twisted grin tugging at the corners of his lips. The drunk had stopped to relieve himself, becoming one of the few most vulnerable positions he could get into. Like a cat tensing to swoop down over a fallen sparrow, he pushed off quickly from his place across the street, eyes holding to the back of the other's head. The words of his spell began to purr from between his gritted teeth, a hissing wind in the stillness of the night. Hands curled up into locked claws, muscles becoming stiff and unyielding to all but a jointed gait. Flicking his tongue over his lips one more time, relishing the stinging burn that came from the moisture hitting the parched flesh, he rounded down on the drunk, the last of the words growled out to gain his attention.</p>

<p>Yelping out with a stumbling surprise, the drunk whirled about, trying to stuff himself back into his pants in case it was the night's man out to drag him off to the holding pen, and fell back against the wall, back hitting it hard. The hand swept out, slashing nails over the cheeks, trying to get him angered, needing the emotions to be overflowing from the shaking body. There was a howl, and the sight of trickling blood, enough to get him hungrier, a mistake if there had been others around. Letting out a harsh snarl, he wrapped his long fingers around the drunk's neck and yanked him from the wall. The other arm slid around his back, holding him in a iron strong embrace, and began to devourer the essences. The aura around the drunk was absorbed easily, slipping from that body and into his. Eyes danced with internal power as he felt the spell taking complete control, bubbling, insane laughter bursting from his lips as he drank the emotions. Most of it a started, frightened rage. The man in his arms suddenly became weak and needed the support of the arm around his back. Flopping down as knees buckled, he held him up to finish. If he had just let the drunk fall into the mud, he would have been left mindless, the unfinished spell too strong for such a simple mind to be able to contain. His own back tightened, the strength he had missed from the week of searching for nourishment coming back to him, the weakness vanished. In fact, it was what the drunk took back to replace the lost emotions, a sickening weakness that would leave him in a coma for the remainder of the night, to be found in the morning by the last night's man patrol.</p>

<p>It's how they always were found.</p>

<p>Without realizing it, the body had slipped from his arms, drained. Eyes of pure white glanced down at it, foot nudging the unconscious form; just to make sure that he indeed was fully drained. A few sharp words cracked from his lips, ending the spell, cutting the thread from the body, and he turned away, satisfied.</p>

<p>A faint smirk played off his thin lips as he strolled slowly out of the town, chuckling at his own private joke. He knew in the morning, that the cries of a Jangol visiting would be spread once the body was found. And knew that this town was off limits for at least half the year, to wait for the crazed scare to die down.</p>

<p>But that hardly mattered. There were hundreds of towns in the surrounding area. And he doubted that he would even bother coming back to this one. </p>
