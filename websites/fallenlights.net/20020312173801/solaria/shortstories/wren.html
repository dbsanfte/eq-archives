Horror. 
<br><br>
A nightmare that'd never leave the back of your head, even when the sun peeked through the pinkening clouds of morning.
<br><br>
That beautiful perfection, twisted and broken by images of something warm and sticky running down one's back. A stain upon satin sheets that had once been pearly white, but now because of this happening many times, were red. Because one's mother was just sick of cleaning up after the child, so they punished her by forcing her to live upon pinkening sheets. A mangled teddy bear huddled as if afraid under the tear-smeared pillows with ruffles and lace.
<br><br>
Horror of a small child in a large, shadowy room, sitting there, eyes staring off into the distance. Trying to forget what was running in her head, trying to forget the noises that leered and sneered just within her hearing, trying to forget the colors that made shapes upon the walls. 
<br><br>
A small child with pretty black curls and large blue eyes. A small child alone in her fluffy, stained bed with a bear that was supposed to protect her.
<br><br>
But that bear was much more afraid of what ever it was that lurked within her head.
<br><br>
The beauty of the perfection in which she lived in. Pristine white walls, shaggy warm carpets, loving glow from lights.
<br><br>
Then the beauty shattering as they looked up that perfection, seeing the blood and smears and tears that ran down dimpled cheeks. A mirror that was cracked, offering the truth behind what was really there, masked by the serene setting of her bedroom.
<br><br>
This was every night for her. Alone with a bear that hide itself under the pillow or the blankets; never under the bed though. There were monsters under it as well. Every night she sat and cried in pain as what she thought was a nightmare was the truth. The stains that she made was the hammer that smashed that beautiful image.
<br><br>
Every night she was taken from her sleep, carried by that mother that refused to wash her blankets, blaming it on the girl for making the messes.
<br><br>
Every night she was laid out upon a cold, steel table, polished and buffed til it glows with an inner light, laying on her belly.
<br><br>
Every night she slept til the first prick of a knife.
<br><br>
That was when she woke, eyes widening to a point where one observing would think that they would roll off that table and across the floor. Silently she would open her mouth and strain against the bonds that held her to the cold table.
<br><br>
The pain would be worse if she uttered a noise, it was terrible when she moved, and sometimes she forgot to keep still like a good girl should. The pain dulled when her mother would pour a concoction down her throat. The pain would always return just as the sun would rise over those pinkening clouds outside her pretty marble stone window.
<br><br>
Once that drink was in her belly, she would still and lay there listlessly as her mother worked like a fanatical madman, cutting delicate lines along her shoulder blades. Removing some muscle and making some go other ways. Placing a small bone against the shoulder blade bone, grafting it in place, and stitching the hole closed.
<br><br>
Each night another small bone was added or one taken away to be replaced by a stronger one. And each night she bleed more, staining her white satin sheets a pretty pink.
<br><br>
Mother thought she looked pretty with the those bones there, for she knew what it would be like in the end, the vision she had for her daughter.
<br><br>
Then, one day mother went away for the night, leaving a servant to keep guard, instructed to make sure that she never rolled over onto her back.
<br><br>
Mother and daughter never spoke to each other, one was too busy for the wails of a child, so the daughter never knew just where her mother vanished off to.
<br><br>
She was feed and watered through out the day as usual, never allowed passed the doors of her room. Even when her mother wasn't around, she was a good girl, sitting quietly by the window, overlooking the landscape.
<br><br>
Mother gave her one instruction though, for her to always do every day. And if she didn't do this one thing, both her and her mother's dreams would never come true. All this work wasted for nothing.
<br><br>
"Pray that you fly this summer, dearest little one. Fly like the birds and the butterflies you watch through your window."
<br><br>
And so--as she sat by the window on her fluffy pillow, chin tucked on her palms, eyes wistfully staring out at the landscape--she prayed silently and out loud. Almost constantly murmuring only lines of prayer to what ever gods were listening to this corner of the world, hoping that her plea was strong enough.
<br><br>
For if she could fly, the pain would end.
<br><br>
She hoped that this day her mother would hear her words as she traveled by gilded coach out to the harbor town, hoping to please her greatly. She wanted to be the perfect daughter, even if it meant that there were spine-like bones jutting out of her puffy flesh along her back, making it impossible to wear pretty gowns like the other girls in keep, or to even leave her stained room to walk out through the grass she watched blow in the wind every day.
<br><br>
And she wanted to fly. That want grew on her as she suffered months and years of careful operations. She wanted to be one of those butterflies that fluttered lazily along with the breeze, or soar like a hawk before it fell upon its prey.
<br><br>
Mother said it'd take some time, but soon.. soon she would be learning how to fly. But first she needed the wings, and that was the painful part of that wish.
<br><br>
Pretty wings like that of a dragonfly, shimmery and transparent. Ones that sparkled like gems. That's what her mother was going to give her.
<br><br>
Sighing out wistfully, she leaned her elbows upon the sill of her one window, tilting her head a bit to watch the swallows chase one of those butterflies across the courtyard below. Dizzying from the height of her vantage point, she sat back and sucked in a few deep breaths of air.
<br><br>
Every day she did this, trying to get used to the height of her body from the ground. Trying to keep the images of falling out of her mind, for then her wings would break and mother would be very upset.
<br><br>
Those were her dreams that she had. Tumbling from a lazy spiral between clouds to plummeting head first to the cobble stones below, blood dripping from cracked bones in her back over the rock. Ruining years of work.
<br><br>
And she always woke right after she hit the ground, her hand always going to her head to feel for the warmth, but then always slipping down and twisting back so that she could carefully feel tender skin. Blood as well.
<br><br>
Mother always blamed her for the blood on the sheets. Blamed her for dreaming up those dreams of her falling, for that made her wish for flying not as strong as she would need it to be to make it happen.
<br><br>
The girl continued to stare out the window, dreaming day dreams as she waited for night to fall, for her mother to return. It was almost like this every day, save for her mother being missing.
<br><br>
She always sat at the window, always praying for the chance to fly. Always falling asleep on her pile of pillows and always giving fright to the servant that watched over her.
<br><br>
Mother only let her eat once a day. Mother said that she had to be slender to be able to fly, to not weight an ounce, for if she did, then that weight would snap her wings and she would fall.
<br><br>
And fall, and fall til her head made contact with the rock below.
<br><br>
Luminous black eyes, fill with her hopes and dreams would close as the sun fell. She would wake in pain when it rose, and as it set, she fell into a peaceful slumber. Her body would slump forward, never backwards for that would crush the bones growing out of her back. Her hair would fall in tumbles, framing her pale round face, eyelashes fluttering as dreams of pretty things would enter her thoughts.
<br><br>
Fingers that clung tightly to the stone, waiting for mother to come home, relaxed and slipped to rest on her lap.
<br><br>
A perfect picture. A pretty girl that rested within the glow of a warm red sun. The warm red sun hiding the brilliant red stains that littered her perfect room, making it truly beautiful for a moment.
<br><br>
A sad look upon the child's face as she rested, a soft breath of air escaping her parted lips. A small child that felt that she wasn't perfect enough for her pretty room or pretty wings.
<br><br>
Her mother returned silently in the night, just as the last of the light fell to rest behind blue, dark clouds. Returning with a gift for her near perfect child. That gift was set aside for another night.
<br><br>
She wasn't ready yet.
<br><br>
Delicate fingers moved, almost dancing on their own as she walked along the narrow corridors, always moving out to run across crisp fabric or hard stone. Eyes of a deep blue would fall upon the sleeping child, the servant never bothering to place the girl in bed on.
<br><br>
She looked upon the black hair, almost blue as the moon lit it from behind some silver cloud, looked upon the pale face that looked so peaceful. She never saw the pain, never heard the girl's cries.
<br><br>
She was doing this child a favor, giving her a gift she had been denied so long ago.
<br><br>
Moving briskly across the thick white carpet with dots of blood here and there, mother carefully lifted the small, rail-thin girl into her arms. Hard eyes searched over the sunken in face of the child, seeing the truth of what she was doing. She looked over the skeleton that was her daughter, some flesh and rags for a dress. Both coated in dried blood.
<br><br>
Turning on her heal, she moved quickly, yet gingerly down the hall to the large room with the steel table.
<br><br>
Careful hands smoothed back the rags, binding up the limp black hair of her daughter, exposing the bones.
<br><br>
White bones that stuck out of the back, bursting from the tender flesh. Red drip marks ran down the child's sallow skin, marring it. With a careful touch, a wet sponge ran over the sickened skin, making it clean for the next incision.
<br><br>
A knife glinted in the air, almost humming as it's sharpness cut at the air. Slowly she and the blade lowered to the back, eyes searching for the old marks she had left last night, opening them again with a single swift cut.
<br><br>
* * *
<br><br>
Mother said she was a pretty creature. Almost as lovely as something imagined, created. Her Mother wanted her to believe that she was one of those imagined creatures of myth, and that in time, she'd be beautiful.
<br><br>
Mother said she was a pretty thing, despite the blood stains on the white satin bed sheets or the small, delicate stitches of a special thread across her back. It was the small bones that jutted from her back that made her pretty; a skeleton of a child with sunken in eyes and a yellowed complexion. But with the working in of wings onto her back, she was very pretty, almost beautiful.
<br><br>
Mother said she was pretty -- sometimes. Other times she was a rotten child that didn't deserve the dinner she got, or the nice toys that littered the white carpet, or the mirror that showed her how pretty she was.
 <br><br>
Mother said her hair was very pretty, that other's were jealous of her because of her hair. Pretty and dark and curly, falling in thick waves down her back. Mother was tempted often, and used as a threat more then once, to chop off those locks and sell them to the wig-maker down the road. Curls framed her boney, sunken face, hugged to the knobby shoulders.
<br><br>
It was hair that even her mother sometimes dreamed of having on her own head. But it went with the start of the wings. Pretty curly hair that hung between the grafted in bones of eagles, long enough to cover her body and hide her innocent skin from prying eyes.
<br><br>
Mother said she was pretty only because Mother made her pretty. Without the start of wings, she would just be like every other sickly little runt of a girl, nothing suitable for marriage later in life.
<br><br>
Maybe her eyes helped as well.
<br><br>
Mother got upset though when she looked at her with those deep, sad eyes. Ones that showed the pain of the needle that worked in and out of her tender flesh each night, a needle that pulled the skin up to the bone, a thread that made it grow into the bone and become part of it. Muscle was also grown into the bone, pulled up so that it would work joints in the future.
<br><br>
Her eyes told the tale of being woken up in the middle of the night by a cold table on her belly and chest and thighs, a smooth grey table of steel. And they spoke of the way Mother yelled when she saw the blood on the nice satin bed sheets, yelling that if she ruined them, she had to sleep in them.
<br><br>
The sheets were almost pink now. A color that teddy didn't like at all, for he was always hiding under the pillow, watching her as she cried herself to sleep. Watching her when she whimpered of nightmares, finding that the blood that she was losing actually was dripping down her back.
<br><br>
* * *
<br><br>
You weren't meant for this world... 
<br><br>
"I wasn't meant.." she echoed, face smeared flat against the cold, frosty glass. "Wasn't meant for anything." 
<br><br>
The shadow behind her turned on heel, the smart sound of metal tipped shoes died away as the shadow vanished out of her room to leave the girl with her face plastered to the cold, smooth glass. Her eyes were fixated upon what was not seen in the misty land of the gardens, watching other shadows. 
<br><br>
"If not for here?" Small hands pushed at the sill, forcing her wrecked body to straight, cheek leaving a mark as she ripped free of the icy glass. "Where?"
