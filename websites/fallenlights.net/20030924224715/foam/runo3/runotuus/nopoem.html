You wont make a poem<br>
you're present like a cat<br>
you won't harden, to make mother-of-pearl<br>
on the bottom of the mind<br>
like another girl<br>
<br>
who was a dream from which I woke up<br>
and noticed I'd slept in a cellar<br>
impressions of concrete on the skin<br>
<br>
you wouldn't shine like her<br>
you won't turn into glass<br>
because sometimes your body<br>
is in bloom like a weekday<br>
<br>
when I didn't have you<br>
<BR>
