<i>Is not . . .</i>
<br><br>
Random bits of Nothing that sat oh-so-silently in a row, sparkling.  The light bouncing off the Nothing's sides, shaping the rainbow of hues that danced before them.  Drawing an eye to inspect just how Something so unimportant could shine like a jewel embedded in a crown.  Catching that singular beam of light and sucking it into its bowels to claim as its own.  Anything could happen, and Everything will.
<br><br>
<i>Glittering . . .</i>
<br><br>
Random bits of Something that lay beyond Nothing, silently watching this happen.  Could be Something there, unsure of that though, or just Anything really.  Another row of things to catch attention, but Nothing was being vain and bold with the dancing light that played before them like hands weaving a web of silk.  So much more important is Something; more so then Nothing.  Unfair really that there was Nothing there to catch the attention of somebody.
<br><br>
<i>Death . . .</i>
<br><br>
Random bits of Anything that gloated silently as the others preened and plucked at their greatness.  Something was certainly better then Nothing, but Anything was blind to this.  Anything is greater then Everything else.  Where as Nothing isn't there, Something makes it so, and Anything will happen.  A dance of the light that streaked over head multiple times, begging and weaving an intricate dance to gain every last bit of attention.  It needed the limelight, for Anything cannot survive without the grace of an audience, for then it is merely Nothing but Something else unimportant.  Then Anything is like Everything else.
<br><br>
<i>Something . . ?</i>
<br><br>
Random bits of Everything lay laughing like the jackal finding a joke within the sky.  So Everything was the best of Anything else, Something laying like Nothing back in the past.  Everything now is the best of them all.  Attention always given to Everything else for it shown like the greatest star in the sky, screaming out for attention, stealing it away from Anything.  Something was Everything, Nothing as well.  As for Anything?  No one knew what was going on there.
<br><br>
<i>No . . .</i>
<br><br>
Random bits of things laying around, all begging for the attention of Somebody.  Really, its all just random bits of information that lay waiting to be noticed.
<br><br>
<i>Nothing to see.</i>
