And the site's been down. And I'm still busy. But I've got three poems, and a new splash page, and a new layout for the poem pop-up. The newest three poems were inspired by my studies of botany, so there's a layout to match them.<br><br>Aug 29, 2002<br><br>Well, I kept half of the promise. The story's here, but in Finnish only. (Actually, I kept three quarters of the promise, because some 3/4 of my visitors are Finns.) <a href="fiction/dreadlocks.html" onClick="window.open( 'fiction/dreadlocks.html','','status=yes,menubar=yes,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=580,height=420') ; return false">Maria</a>.<br><br>Accepted by <a href="http://fallenlights.net/indice/" target="_blank">Indice</a>.<br><br>Aug 28, 2002<br><br>Again a new layout.
