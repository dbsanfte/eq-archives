<p>No Samatory stood erect in the center of a forest that spanned from edge to edge of one of three Nations of Teirn, a blackened mar in lush green. It could be seen from a distance, if one strained to search the horizon while perched on a rocky cliff in the mountains. Just a small mark of black before the sea reached out to stop the expansion of the forest. A river from that sea roamed around the city like a wide moat of dangerous undertows and murky waters, then wandered off into the forest and traveled to the heart of the monstrous green land where it dwindled away to nothing. It was an island of sorts, three sides cut out by the river, the forth being the sea itself, and No Samatory spread itself out on that entire bit of land. Large walls that stood taller then fifty men and thicker then the same amount wrapped itself around the edge of the island, save for where a moderately sized port butted out into the sea. The walls were of black granite, lifeless and black, darker then the night sky when none of the three moons were hovering in the air. They seemed to suck in the light itself and never reflect it back out as marble did. It was just there. As was the Temple that squatted in the middle of the city, rising five stories without including the spires that pierced the sky. There was the main building of fancy carvings for decoration and then six towers that climbed upwards like groping fingers for the heavens. From each floor of those towers there were bridges that ran between all the towers, the top most keeping the snow on its surface weeks after all other bits of winter had faded. Men and women in stiff uniforms and armed with lances that doubled as lanterns during the night walked the bridges, eyes trained upon the city or out towards the borders of the forest. Vigilant and loyal to their home, they suffered the harsh winters that left feet of snow on the ground and winds that threatened to blow them from their lofty battlements. Within the walls of the Temple, safe from the harsh life outside, the Priests of the city worshiped and prayed and prophesied, the latter bringing them concerns for the future almost daily. Those concerns in turn were offered up to the goddess of the moon, Sei'sa, who only answered with more puzzlement for them to fret over.</p>

<p>Outside of the city was the ring of angels, all screaming silently to the same goddess for mercy that had never been granted to them. Each was the exact copy of the next, though the names for each were different. Their death the same, granted by the same hand. Each disturbed almost every sari within No Samatory to where they drew back and hide, passing laws and forbidding traditions. And cut themselves off from the very race that had gave them existence in the first place, though brought death to them without a question asked or reason given. Magic, after the breaking of the bond between the elves and the saris, was outlawed a moment after the War that had done the cutting had finished. Within fifty years of that law being passed, the magic was breed out of the sari race completely so that never again was something so tainted brought into their lives. Their walls had grown, not only in this one city, but all the others-though smaller-settlements, protecting them from everything. Sometimes beasts came from the forests to batter at their defenses, giving the Guard something to practice against, but never another soul that was not of sari blood. Or so they had believed.</p>

<p>Mialyn's eyes of purest gold were lifted to regard her old home, though not her real home. There had been other places where she had lived, another place where she had been born. It had not been No Samatory, she only came there within the arms of an elf Wizard, both disguised by the outlawed magic to seem as the sari people. Then she had been but a child of ten or so, not understanding what was going on, why she had left her old home back in the elven Nation, why she had been hushed into revealing who she was with threats of death. She never really felt at home within the city, not even after spending a good majority of her life hiding her real self from all around, even from the family that had taken heart at seeing her on their doorstep. For now she could not look else where, not at the two Guards that were leading her to the gate, nor at the forest or the angels as she passed them by. The blackness and massive structures were making her remember things that she had hoped to never draw out of the back of her mind.</p>

<p>Quickly she shook her head to clear out the memories before she fell into a Dreaming, something that would make her fall unconscious for some unknown amount of time, and with two Guards at her side, it was a risk she could not chance. Giving a glance off to her right, to the one that had said her name out loud with a look of shock in his eyes, she let out a faint sigh and dropped her gaze, not wanting any more attention. But for some reason, she could not recall him at all, and he had refused to speak his name to her. It was like she was being tested, and she had a dreadful feeling that he doubted who she was. Wondering if he was able to see through her disguise, she mere shrugged her shoulders to her own thoughts, ignoring any looks shot in her direction. They were silent, and so was she with lips sealed in a thin line as if annoyed at her treatment.</p>

<p>Reaching the bridge that crossed over the river, the one that had caught her stopped dead, and shoved some paper into the other's hand. "I can take her from here." </p>
