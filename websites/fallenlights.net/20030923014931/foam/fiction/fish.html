Her skin is green and her hair white. She often wants to walk on the bottom among the seaweed when the water is clear on sunny days. She takes long steps, and the sand is whirls from under her bare feet. She also often swims towards the surface with her broad hands and feet. She enjoys the glittering of the water and sees the sun as a ragged image above her, but she can&#146;t rise very high, because then the pressure would be too low.<br><br>Aldo is a beautiful young woman. Her short hair flows with the current of the sea when she&#146;s walking or swimming around. She has a little house in a shadowy hole sheltered by a bank of rock and she catches fish to help her mother and father when she&#146;s not spending time with her friends.<br><br>Els is a girl of the same age as Aldo, but Els lives on land and breathes air with her lungs. Anyhow, sometimes she puts heavy weight shoes to her feet, an oxygen bottle pack to her back and a diver&#146;s helmet to her head and goes to see Aldo. Els likes these visits more than anything even if at the bottom of the sea she&#146;s as clumsy as a turtle is on land.<br><br>When Els is on land, she likes to run on the grass on the beach and ride a bike along a sand road at a wild pace, but on the sea bottom she can&#146;t move so fast. That&#146;s why Els envies and loves Aldo, who moves along the water as light and mobile as a fish. Els hates her brown skin that needs the sun and her smooth sides that don&#146;t have gills in them.<br><br>Once Els has been in the water for a long time. When she rises up to the shore she&#146;s tired and her muscles are sore. Where Els lives it&#146;s always summer, but now it&#146;s late in the evening and Els is cold. There&#146;s sand under her nails and her fingers are wrinkled because she&#146;s been underwater for so long. Els would have wanted to stay with Aldo at the bottom for a lot longer but she musn&#146;t spend too long a time deep in the water. Els is angry at her skin that can&#146;t endure endless swimming, and her lungs that need air to breathe, and her ears that begin to ache at the bottom. Tears well up in her eyes when she sits on the beach and hoped in vain that she could spend all her time with Aldo, the one she loves.<br><br>The next day Els returns to the bottom, and like almost always, they talk for a long time. Aldo always looks forward to these conversations, because Els always tells her about the strange, two-dimensioned life taking place on land. She&#146;s never seen it, and she&#146;s interested in the sun, the animals that cannot get off from the ground but walk on its surface for their whole lives, breathing air and Els&#146;s life in the world that&#146;s her own. Els and Aldo talk for hours, until it&#146;s time for Els to go back, and both of them start missing each other sorely.<br><br>Els starts to make little drawings that she covers with plastic. She makes pictures of animals that live on earth; elephants, dogs and sparrows. After a few weeks Els finishes her work and goes to the bottom of the sea to show her pictures to Aldo. Aldo is delighted and excited to see the pictures, and every time Els hands her a picture Els touches her skin lightly, and every time Els starts at the hardness and slipperiness of it. And after giving her the last picture, Els leaves her hand on Aldo&#146;s hand. They look each other in the eyes for several seconds, and Aldo puts her hand to Els&#146;s shoulder. Els would like to touch Aldo with her lips, and she has wanted it for a long time. But they both know Els can&#146;t remove her helmet. And so Els takes her hand from Aldo&#146;s shoulder and opens the conversation again. Soon neither of them thinks about touching any more.<br><br>After that touch, even the little hope she had secretly had of owning Aldo was finally lost. She visits her friend at the bottom of the sea more and more rarely. Soon Aldo and Els meet no more.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> <BLOCKQUOTE>  <BLOCKQUOTE>| <a href=# onClick="window.close();">close window</a> |            </BLOCKQUOTE>  </BLOCKQUOTE></font></body></HTML>
