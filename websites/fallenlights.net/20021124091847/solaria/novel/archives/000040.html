<p>(this is the temporary book's ending. Or at least part of the ending)</p>

<p>"Darian! Look at me. Look up at me, please," she cried out suddenly in a broken choke. She was cradling him against her, half his mashed body on her thighs, his untouched face close to hers. He was not responding, though, to any of her pleadings. He was breathing, but shallow, a breath once in a moment, just coming as she thought one would never come again. Blood dripped from his slash on his chest, from the gash in his arm, the arrow's shaft still quivering in the gentle breeze. Most of the blood, red and sticky against her white arms, came from the hole in his stomach. The arrow one of the Jangol's men had shot at her, but he had been walking up the hill at that moment, just turning into it's range as it was let loose, and it pierced him instead. "Darian," she muttered, running her hand through his golden brown hair. He moaned, and shifted, then groaned again from the movement of his own tattered self. She saw the struggle as he opened his eyes. There was a moment of confusion as he tried to reason out who was holding him, but then he smiled faintly. "Darian, don't you do that again, you scared half my life away! You can't leave me alone. What will happen when the baby asks who her father is? Don't close your eyes." She babbled nonsense for a moment, then fell silent, her lips quivering.</p>

<p>"Mi. . . . Do you. . . . You ring bell?" he paused, searching for another way to say it. "In city. . . . Do you ring bell for dead?"</p>

<p>It was the wrong thing he could ask her. Frantically, she pressed her lips on his forehead. "For those who have died, I am making sure that there are bells. Cristan gets the first toll, because he was Sarin'sal. But, there are only three tolls, Darian, one each to those who died. Cristan, Ksenia, and Lance. Only three."</p>

<p>"Good," he struggled to say. "But, what's . . . in my . . . stomach?"</p>

<p>Her eyes widened, shocked that he did not know what had hit him. "An. . . . An arrow, love. Dezrid's coming here in a few moments to remove it."</p>

<p>He nodded as if accepting the fact, and pushing it aside as if it meant nothing, then relaxed in her arms, letting his eyes shut sleepily. He was so tired. "Mia?"</p>

<p>"Darian, look at me!"</p>

<p>"Sorry." He opened his clouding gray eyes and tried to focus on her, but she was a distant, blurred shadow.</p>

<p>"What were you going to say?"</p>

<p>"Promise . . . not to hurt me? You are . . . not going to like what . . . I am going to say."</p>

<p>"I swear on my life," she whispered hesitantly. "Did you kill somebody?"</p>

<p>"Many, my love," he smiled. He remembered asking her that himself, once when she was the one collapsing in a pile of strain. It had been so long ago, a memory he had trouble resurfacing. He just remembered asking her if she had killed somebody. "That's not what I have to ask of you." He frowned, and tried to hold the blood from his mouth. It was too warm, and coated his tongue thickly. "Promise that when we go back to the city. . . There is one more person who you forgot to give a bell toll to. . ."</p>

<p>"Someone else died?" she asked softly. He grimaced again. She did not understand what he was trying to say. The blood trickled out of the corner of his mouth, dripping onto her already stained shirt sleeve.</p>

<p>Suddenly he saw her.</p>

<p>He blinked at the clarity, the sharpness of her shadows and sunlight glinting off her hair which was blowing in the wind, the paleness of her face, the creased lines of worry he had caused her when the blood began to flow, the blood from his wounds streaked across her face as if she was a wild warrior with battle paint, and the glow from her brilliant gold eyes filled with tears. He blinked again. It was gone. The shadows returned and pushed him into a comforting warmth far from the throbbing pain of the wounds. He was weakening, and his head spun wildly out of control.</p>

<p>"Just promise that you will be the one ringing the bell?"</p>

<p>"I promise. I will ring the bell myself, Dar, just tell me for who?" she whispered. Or shouted, he could not tell. Her hand rested on his forehead, stroking gently, pushing back the dull throbs. He closed his eyes again and sighed, drinking in her warmth to his cold body. Her slender hand ran into his. . . .</p>

<p>"Darian? Tell me who. And would you look up at me, you won't get better if you don't keep your eyes open."</p>

<p>He did not open his eyes.</p>

<p>She realized, with a dried mouth filled with sand, that her words were useless, so she let them flutter away on a gentle breeze that had suddenly swirled around her. It took her words and carried them over the empty fields. Then, the breeze gathered strength and speed and flew up higher and higher into the cloudless sky.</p>

<p>She sat there for a few moments, letting his limp hair fall through her fingers like rays of sunlight running through the tree branches. Gods, he knew all along. As soon as the arrow had slammed into the pit of his stomach and he fell into a pile of dry bones and blood. His blood that was still warm on her skin. It will only be a few minutes before he ran out of life, and then it would grow cold. A tear dripped from her nose. Somewhere from within the branches over her head came a warble of a bird,whistling as if there had been nothing going on just below his perch. </p>
