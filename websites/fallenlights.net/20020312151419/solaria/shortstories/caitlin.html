"Momma . . .well," she started softly, squinting past the day-glow brightness of the sphere pointed at her face.  “She wasn’t really ever liked by most people, not the kids at school and not even her neighbors.  There weren’t any family, so we didn’t worry about them not liking her.  See, well, my momma kept me away from the drugs and the street-rats that plagued this part of the town, you know, look out side and you’ll probably see one slinking along in the shadows.  But, she was like those rats, except for the fact that she didn’t live on the street, just a grubby one roomed apartment that looked over the street."
<br><br>
Her eyes shifted away from the burning spotlight, brown, soft brown eyes fixing upon a stranger in the front row of round tables.  She glanced at his face, practically black because of the spot blinding her, then to the table where a ratty, black leather book with cracks and yellowed paper lay waiting for her.  Inside it were scribbled stories in her mother’s hand, as well as bits of paper with her own writing.  "But momma kept me far away from those people for as long as she could.  Not when I walked to school though, she couldn’t drive, never got her license, not that we could buy a car if she did.  So instead of going alone, she made plans for me to walk with another girl down the block, just so the rats would leave us alone.
<br><br>
"Momma had a way with words.  She always said I did as well, talking my way out of tough spots, just as she had when she was younger.  She was an actress for some company that read Shakespeare all day and night, she loved it.  She read the sonnets till the moment she died, it was the last words on her lips as she looked at the window, breathing out a few whispers that only I heard.  Really, ‘cause the doctor and nurse were not in the room when she passed on, I guess it was better that way.  If they had been, they would have tried to keep her alive longer--for me, that’s what they always said.  That’s what she always said, hanging on just a bit longer, making sure that I grew up just a bit more.  But it hurt her to breath, and so I’m sort of glad that she left while it was only me present.  It had only been a moment when I was in the room when she went, wanting to say goodnight to me, hanging on just a moment longer so I could say goodnight as well."  The girl’s hand lifted to smear a few driblets of tears from her cheek, she always got misty eyed when talking of her mother, especially when it was in front of strangers.  It didn’t make her stop speaking to the audience; she just wanted to listen to the soft hum of the electricity of that brilliant spotlight over head.  Her voice was louder now, more forced with strain to keep the tears away.  "She gave me a present as she recited the last sonnet, a little charm that I couldn’t take from her.  Not even now, it’s still with her, although I can see it whenever I want.  I won’t tell you where it is, because I don’t want you finding it.  Nor what it is, because, well . . . I just don’t want you to know.
<br><br>
"She had a hard time living, and I had a hard time accepting she wasn’t living anymore after she finally gave in.  It was cancer or something like that, incurable.  At least the doctors said it wasn’t.  I think it was just because she couldn’t pay the medical bill that made them say it.  Cheaper for her to die then live another year.  The drinking did her in, my dad being the one to start her with the drinking when he left her for the streets.  Golden streets on the upper part of the city.  I’m sure he’s forgotten us, two little rats that were lucky enough to have a room.  I’m sure he’s got some fancy black car that shimmers even when no light is reflecting off it, one of those fancy suits and shiny shoes.  Probably one of those fancy girls to walk around with him."  Her words had grown a bit harsh as she spoke of her father, eyes fixed upon a clock in the back of the room to keep her concentrating.  "But enough of dad, don’t really remember him, just remember that he didn’t like momma too much.
<br><br>
"After he left, she fell.  Not the falling that hurts your body with bruises, the kind where her mind goes numb and to keep it numb she smoked anything and everything and drank more then she smoked.  She asked me to stay at school longer, join something.  So I stayed away with sports and singing and some play practices.  I didn’t care that she couldn’t get up out of the bed in those last two years she lived--that’s how long she made it after dad left--I knew why she couldn’t make it, I understood.  Least I think I did."  Her narrow, bare shoulders shrugged a bit, her raggy dress of cotton dyed in a plaid pattern swung around at her sudden movement, swishing over the dusty wood floor.  Her large brown eyes fixed to look at the stranger again, seeing that he was looking back at her with this faint smile, kind and pretty.  He had said hello to her after she had read some Shakespeare passage from Hamlet, the one that was over done with the skull.  She didn’t have a skull though for the scene, but he had loved it despite that.  Becoming nervous while looking at him she pulled her eyes back to the round face of the white clock, glowing its numbers so that people would know when to go home.  "So maybe she’s not perfect like that girl dad has now, but she had a heart.  At least one large enough to keep me loving her like a mother, even after she started making herself sick by doing some bad things to herself.  She kept me in school even after I didn’t want to go, all those kids picking on me because I didn’t have the nice clothes, that they had little stains on it because the washing machine in the building was busted, and washing them in the sink just wasn’t the same.
<br><br>
I just don’t think she’ll be proud of me anymore.  Those streets that she kept me off of, well, that’s where I live most of my life, that one room apartment scares me too much.  You know, those bad vibes, like she still haunts it.  And well, I stopped going to school because it hurt too much, it hurt and momma wasn’t there anymore to hug her.  But, I’ll not be there long, I promised that to her.  So I’ll do what ever I can to find my guardian angel to keep me safe like she did.  And maybe, just maybe that angel with have a heart like momma did, and love Shakespeare . . ."
<br><br>
She closed her mouth and glanced around at the audience, finished with her small story.  They all were looking at her with a dumbfounded silence.  Probably because she was only a fourteen year old.  Maybe.  Or maybe it was true what the stranger had said, that she had some talent.  That stranger was the first to clap and when she glanced at him, she offered just the faintest smile, a mere upturn of her lips.  He had offered her, before she had spoken, a place to stay, and people to see.  And he seemed to love Shakespeare, at least the piece that she had spoken, he had loved.
