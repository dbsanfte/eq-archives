Even if I&#146;d happen to leaf through a fitness magazine, would I then want to look like the people in it, all muscles? If I go to Morocco, do I suddenly feel the need to become a Muslim? I think not.<BR><BR>Then why should the Cosmopolitan magazine make me want to be a thin, big-breasted woman that all men desire? Or how would I want, after reading Maxim, to change into a lad that&#146;s interested, according to their slogan, &#148;sex, sports, beer, gadgets, clothes, fitness&#148;?<BR><BR>It is said that the society or culture makes unreasonable demands for people on beauty or their lifestyle. But these &#148;demands&#148; really shouldn't affect grown-up, independent people.<BR><BR>The right attitude is tourism: I&#146;m just an outsider, a visitor. Even if I&#146;d be interested in visiting a gay bar or a straight bar or reading J17 or Men&#146;s Health, I won&#146;t, of course, want to become like the &#148;man&#148; or &#148;woman&#148; that&#146;s presented in e.g. the so-called lifestyle magazines. It&#146;s nice to go for a visit to different worlds, fascinated but with no need to change oneself to be exactly like the stereotypical human marketed by these worlds&#146; cultures.<BR><BR>One must not want to make a package deal. Just because someone&#146;s got stylish trousers doesn&#146;t mean their opinions are justified. And vice versa.<br><br><BR><BR>            <BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>| <a href=# onClick="window.close();">close window</a> |            </BLOCKQUOTE>  </BLOCKQUOTE></p></td></tr></table></font></body></HTML>
