<br>A Globe Floated<br>

<div align=justify>
<p><i>A globe floated . . .</i> <br />
<br><br><br />
Strange.  The silver orb, polished and cold, bobbed gentle on a waft of air, too light to be drawn down into the clutches of gravity, waited before her face.  It seemed to watch her, tilting itself, rotating as if to take pictures.  Then it would pause and rock up and down, currents of air pushing over its glassy surface, disturbing its concentration.   Her hair is pushed by the same breeze, and gets in her eyes.<br />
<br><br><br />
<i>Over the country . . .</i><br />
<br><br><br />
Distraction.  She pushes back her normal hair, her gray eyes never leaving the globe's spherical surface and just waits, unsure what else she could do.  It was a giant eye, never blinking, nor looking elsewhere.  Only at her.  But, maybe the other uncountable curves held-beneath its surface-hiding thousands of cameras, watching everything as the many-fractured lens of a housefly.  Collecting data of her and the blank corners and white walls and mesh carpet.  To send it back.   But back where? Watching the slow rotation, she tried to figure out if-and how-the pictures she knew it was taking got back to the source.  Its master behind the eye.<br />
<br><br><br />
<i>Searching for the perfection . . .</i><br />
<br><br>	<br />
Shiver.  Her hands wring together . . . then stops . . . feeling that if she was being surveyed, then it would be best to not be nervous.  So her muscles in her cheek began to twitch and she held back a sigh.  The rotation paused for a moment.  She froze and stared hard, trying to see past the icy layer of silver, to see the cameras.  Hoping that there really were cameras, not just a feeling.  She did not want to be seen as too curious, but her gaze never flickers from the surface.<br />
<br><br><br />
<i>Over the seas . . .</i><br />
<br><br><br />
Sigh.  Muscles not moving, she is in a daze and her eyes are blinking.  Her brain fades out, then jumps back to consciousness and she wakes back up.  She lost the time, not that it matters, but it would be nice to know how many minutes she had been just standing there.<br />
<br><br><br />
<i>But does not find it here . . .</i><br />
<br><br><br />
Blink.  Opening her eyes, she sees that the globe she had been staring at has moved away from her, as if it lost interest.  She pushes away her gray-streaked brown hair and hobbles off to sit down.<br />
<br><br><br />
<i>And starts to search again . . .</i><br />
