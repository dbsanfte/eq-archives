Up to a certain point, this can anyhow be avoided by listening to bands with a short and more slender audience. The rule of thumb is the more aggressive the music and the uglier the players, the larger the fans. HIM and Boyzone are good and Rammstein extremely bad.<BR><BR>&#8211; As long as you can, enjoy raging like mad, carried by the energy of music, even to bands that are not so good. I, too, thought I&#146;d never become one of those who stand behind the rushing crowd with a pint on their hands and criticise the mixing.<BR><BR>&#8211; Never talk to anyone about metal. A metalhead will laugh at you because to them, &#148;real (black, death, speed, power, thrash) metal&#148; always means, by chance, the same as &#148;the bands you&#146;ve never heard about&#148;. A non-metalhead will laugh at you just because you&#146;re interested of metal.<BR><BR>&#8211; Anyhow, if you want to go to a metal gig, be careful when you choose your haircut. Hair metal: Manowar, Iron Maiden, Stratovarius. Bald metal: Rammstein, Meshuggah.<BR><BR>&#8211; If the person in front of you keeps jostling against you despite several requests to stop, it is permitted to open their backpack without their knowledge.<BR><BR>&#8211; If it&#146;s allowed and fairly safe, crowdsurf whenever you can. It feels like flying.<BR><BR><BR><BR></p> <BLOCKQUOTE>  <BLOCKQUOTE>| <a href=# onClick="window.close();">close window</a> |            </BLOCKQUOTE>  </BLOCKQUOTE></font></body></HTML>
