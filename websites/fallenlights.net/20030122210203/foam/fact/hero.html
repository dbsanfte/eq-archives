If you want to get out of your home country, you can go to a travel agency and reserve a package tour to Greece or Italy, go to the package tour day trips there, eat in a tourist restaurant and buy souvenirs from a souvenir shop. Anyhow, this kind of travelling doesn&#146;t sound very credible, at least not among young adults. The popularity of independent travels grows year after year.<br><br>An independent traveller, i.e. a hero traveller, is the opposite of a tourist, a mythic creature who, as a rule, does everything the hard way. They reserve every part of their trip &#8211; the flight or train tickets, accommodation and the eventual day trips &#8211; themselves, travel from one country to another by a noisy night train, sleep in cheap hostels and always live on as small a budget as possible. The ones who deliberately make their journey harder get respect, because you can&#146;t become a hero without challenges. What&#146;s this all about?<br><br>I myself am definitely a crazy hero traveller, because I left for Germany, Poland and the Baltic Countries in the middle of winter. It was freezing everywhere, especially in Warsaw. There was no hope of the joys of summer holidays, e.g. sitting in the park, eating ice cream, wandering carelessly around the city in a t-shirt and sitting on a restaurant terrace until late at night. In the other hand, there aren&#146;t long lines to the sights, and i.e. churches aren&#146;t too crowded. In what&#146;s probably the most famous sight of Warsaw, the Palace of Culture and Sciences, we were seemingly the only people inside the building who weren&#146;t working there during half an hour. Outside the travelling season, the traveller sees something more authentic of the local life: a bit more of the people walking down the streets are natives and the employee of the Vilnius museum of contemporary art possibly isn&#146;t quite as bored with non-Polish-speaking tourists as in July.<br><br>One doesn&#146;t really go to a hero travel only to cause troubles to oneself, but to be closer to the local way of life. Even if travellers won&#146;t meet many natives, they at least buy their food in the same store as the natives. Still, even if you&#146;re a hero traveller you&#146;re also a tourist, because you go see the sights and wonder at things that the local people find commonplace, even boring. (The travel guides&#146; mantra &#148;to avoid trouble, look as local as you can&#148; is nonsense. How could anybody who doesn&#146;t know where to turn from the next corner of the street look like the native person who walks purposefully towards home? Am I not allowed to study the map at the corner of the street, take photographs, or even look around astonished, because natives don&#146;t do this? Bollocks. The common sense will usually tell you when an alley is too dark. Simply crossing the national border won&#146;t make you a poor little squirrel unprotected by any law.)<br><br>Since budget is the keyword of hero travelling, I can also travel more often if I&#146;m ready to live on a little less. Few people have too much money, but anyhow, not many people are ready to sleep under a bench in the park and eat pigeons for lunch. Therefore there is no ultimate hero traveller, as there&#146;s always someone who travels cheaper and someone who spends more money on their trip than you. Everyone chooses their own level of comfort and considers which conveniences they&#146;re willing to sacrifice in favour of saving a little money for the next trip. Besides, a lot of the so-called conveniences that expensive hotels offer are completely needless: I, at least, couldn&#146;t care less about whether the shower is in my room or shared. Independent travelling doesn't have to be too uncomfortable.<br><br>Maybe the heroes go on the trip also to remind themselves of how good it is at home. An ordeal is only valuable after you&#146;ve got over it, are safe and sleep soundly at home. At home I get to eat regularly, can fairly well decide about how much I sleep, get to take a shower whenever I want to and understand what the shop assistant says when she&#146;s asking whether I&#146;ve got the market chain bonus card.<br><br>The lack of mutual understanding is, in fact, one of the most painful things to the traveller. Even the simplest thing is difficult when you can&#146;t ask for advice. I can&#146;t speak Lithuanian and most of the Lithuanians don&#146;t speak Finnish, English or French. (Still, carefulness mustn't be forgotten: In a bus in Vilnius we chatter, tired, about the fact that the increasing separatism between the sexual preferences will soon surely lead to a situation where they ask you at a cafe whether you want a gay sandwich or a straight sandwich. Then, a young man gets off the bus on the same bus stop as we and says in Finnish, with a foreign accent: &#148;Excuse me. I think that Finnish is a very beautiful language&#148; and leaves us standing there and making guesses about how much he understood of our speech.) We got by with poor German and even poorer Russian.<br><br>Actually, the most important words for the traveller &#8211; post, ticket, railway station, hostel and so on &#8211; can be divided into good and bad words, judging by how international they are. The ticket &#148;biljet&#148;, and the post, &#148;post&#148;, are definitely good, because you can get by with one word almost throughout Europe. The map and the railway station are, on the other hand, bad, because every language has a different word for them, which leads to confused explaining on the railway station info desk: &#148;Map, plan, kart?&#148;<br><br>But understanding will always, finally, be reached. You speak with your hands, you use whichever languages you can speak, and you smile kindly. Eastern Europe is often, and quite needlessly, considered unkind. When you come from Berlin, you certainly get a little shock when the old woman at the toilet&#146;s pay desk thinks personal service means opening the toilet&#146;s door and shoving the &#8211; probably too slowly operating &#8211; traveller inside, jabbering something in Polish all the time. However, this isn't unfriendliness. The farther west you go in Europe, the more there prevails a mentality according which everybody minds their own business. Everybody is smiled at and asked &#148;Thank you, and would you like something else?&#148; When you move east, the great, public, impersonal and neutral space disappears from around people. Even a large, American-style coffeehouse doesn&#146;t serve as a public living room and a place to be seen, like it does even in Helsinki.<br><br>When I walk, tired and carrying an enormous and heavy backpack, against the horizontally moving snow, a thought comes to me: maybe I&#146;m not going on a trip explicitly to have fun, i.e. experience positive feelings. Maybe I&#146;m going on a trip to experience just any feelings. It&#146;s boring at home, but when travelling, my moods change from euphoria mixed with amazement to despair that&#146;s accentuated by being hungry, tired, and lost. The hero traveller, fed up with the quiet of the house and the ease of living in their own country, will do anything to kill the apathy.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR> <BLOCKQUOTE>  <BLOCKQUOTE>| <a href=# onClick="window.close();">close window</a> |            </BLOCKQUOTE>  </BLOCKQUOTE></font>      </td>  </tr></table></BODY></HTML>
