<br>
<br>The Lights<br>

<br>

<p><p>The lights in the cavern flickered out.<br /><br />
<BR><br>It must have been the winds that had gusted through from the fields below, but as weak as they had felt, they were powerful enough to sputter the glowing orange flames to smoke.  The gusts pulled together, banding into a twisting wraith of air.  The cold, refreshing breeze they had greedily welcomed, had suddenly become their worst enemy, laughing its coolness as a mock to their defenses.<br /><br />
<br><BR><i>Ah, </i>it whispered, <i>now the darkness is upon you.  What will you do?  Block the passage with a boulder to keep me out? It will keep you in.  Live in the night.  Keep the smoke from reforming into the light, I and you have no use for such brilliance.<br /><br />
<br><BR>Live in the night and the night with live in you.  Don?t fear me, </i>she called with a hiss of dark love,<i> I will keep you from those within.  Those that you will learn to fear into death itself.  Hold me close; draw me into your heart as you would a timid babe or the sweetness of a lover.  Take me as I devour you.  Nothing but your weakening spirit will stop me, and now it may be too late as I whisper you towards my sleeping words.</i><br /><br />
<br><BR>The voice, filled with passion and the sticky longing for new life, surrounded them, blocking off their hope.  It formed pictures of things in their minds.  Images of dark cloaks hanging limply in the storm, of shades wrapped in the moonless glitter, and of those creatures found deep in the pits of churning stomachs, where everything was there to harm.<br /><br />
<br><BR><i>From those within.</i>  Arthimus shook in his sleep and rolled over, batting up at the blackness as if there was something there.  Well, to him there was.  He thought that the air was dropping down, covering him with a thick blanket of smog and soot that blocked his lungs from sucking in the sweetness the dark should have had.  Nothing was there.  His mind registered the web that held the breath from escaping, and jumped to alarm.  He sputtered, coughing out the foulness of the old, used air that had been trapped, then sat up and groaned.  Rubbing his sweaty palms over his eyelids, he forced himself to look at the black.  He paused in confusion, thinking with startled surprise that his eyes were still sealed from the light that had been there when he and the others laid down to rest.  Peeling his eyes open again, and only to find that they were already opened, he stood quickly.  Too quickly, for he swayed with dizziness and blinded by the sparks of light behind his eyes.  He took step backwards and twisted his foot.  Holding out his hands as if to grope for the support he needed at that moment, he tumbled forward with a limp, rolling fall.<br /><br />
<br><BR>And succeeded in tripping into the body lying next to him.  She stirred angrily, but then slide back into her dreams, muttering harsh words of nothing.  Catching his breath from the stumble, he stared down at his blue tinted hands before pushing himself up again, only now noticing the way his veins seemed to throb painfully.  He never really studied his hands before, never to the time to look closely at something familiar and see the strangeness.  Gangly thin, bony hands that constantly had the tendency to be frozen and stiff, and at other times swelling with the pain of searing fire.  They were stiff now after the torment of relaxation of sleep, something his limbs never seemed to be able to do; never unlock and lie comfortable.  Shaking his head he pushed up from the cold stone floor and got to his feet again, this time with more steadiness.<br /><br />
<br><BR>Looking back around warily, searching for the source of the caress of darkness in his mind, he saw a shadow within the shadows.   A glossy texture that stood silently, caught the dim light from the full moon outside the gapping mouth of the cave, watching him with her eyes.  Which he could see now.<br /><br />
<br><BR><i>Ah, my love has seen his mistress, </i>she drawled, her tongue running over her polished black lips.  <i>Why do you still stand and watch?  Are you afraid?</i>  It was a taunting, dry voice, and he shivered, but stood his ground.<br /><br />
<br><BR>Sending his thoughts to her, the shimmering creature of onyx wind, he replied casually, <i>shall we move outside?  Where I can gaze upon you with the light of the moon?<br /><br />
<Br><BR><strong>NO!</strong>  I will remain here, </i>she cried.  A shape lurched out towards him, but it was only her arm, shrouded in starglitter and moon dew.  And she remained watching, her eyes, cold and dark flashing dangerously.  Her black lips curved into a pouting frown, and she stood, one arm reaching for him.  <i>I will remain here, and you will come to <strong>ME!</strong><br /><br />
<br><BR>Will I? </i>he jested, crossing his arms and leaning back on one leg.  One slender eyebrow raised as if questioning a joke.  <i>And just how will I come to you?  Is this some game, malady of starlight?</i><br /><br />
<br><BR>She gave in.<br /><br />
<br><BR>She opened her mouth, parting her lips to suck in a breath of air.  Her dress of polished darkness rippled around her lithe form as she drew back into the wall, a frantic look to her gaze, but then she drifted forward.  Though cautiously, as if she was afraid.  And he saw her timidness to step from her corner, and smiled lightly.  Her feet slipped along the cold stone silently, but her skirts hissed at the contact and movement.  And as she drew closer her eyes cast a strange hue of midnight sky, reflecting what was behind her at him.  <i>I know your name, Arthimus, and you know mine, </i>she whispered tightly as she neared him.  <i>Won't you speak it so I remember?<br /><br />
<br><BR>Lady of Night, you must wait for that pleasure, </i>he spoke back.  His mind calmed her, enough so that when she drew her last step it was steady and placed perfectly.  <i>But do you remember what you are?  And how you became yourself?<br /><br />
<br><BR>I do, Arthimus.  That is something <strong>NO</strong> one could forget.  </i>Her eyes darted over him, surveying him in the darkness she commanded.  <i>I am my dark air.  You saw to this.  You were the one who gave me to the Night.  </i>She glared at him furiously, her eyes filled with fire  Yet when she called out to him, it was a scream of pain and searing love.  <i>I loved you once, and you me.  Why?  Why, did you toss me away into the Night?<br /><br />
<br><BR>Once?  You no longer love me?  </i>He reached out with his cold, shaking hand, and wiped away her tear of ice.  It shattered on the stone.  <i>I had no choice.   It was my love taken from me for a thousand years, or the Night's rule over all.  Do you think that this was what I wanted?  Did you actually think that I <strong>WILLINGLY</strong> gave you to Him?  My heart is gone from my chest.   It lives within you until the day I can have you back.  </i>His mind spoke to her with the same wanting force as hers, but the strength was filled with loss at what he had done.  <i>I have lived too long with you following me like a shadow.  Everywhere I go, I see you standing in the distance.<br /><br />
<br><BR>A distance in which the Night commands me to keep, </i>she cried out.  When she looked up at him, her eyes had lightened.   A crystal blue, not so unlike the depths of the brook that caught the sunlight.  But then it vanished, like a memory that surfaced once in a dark light.  Now she looked upon him with an eclipsed gaze.  Studying what she knew as her old self.  <i>Will you speed the time?</i><br /><br />
<br><BR>He shuddered, his wall of sturdiness caving in at the howl of her empty voice.  Sagging back, returning to the guise of an old withered man of centuries, he drew in a ragged breath.  <i>You know I cannot.<br /><br />
<br><BR>But you won't try? </i> She surged forward again, her arms reaching to embrace him, but when she caught the look he gave her, she shrank back, once again a simple shade of Night. <i> You won't try, </i>she hissed with a shiver.  Her black eyes, glittering like gems fled his stare.  He watched her too carefully, almost as if he held no trust in his power.<br /><br />
<br><BR><i>It isn't that I won't, but cannot.   Or else I shall never be able to glimpse upon you again.</i>  He remained against the wall, though his weakened, old body reformed once again to that of a younger lad.  His eyes remained locked on her, waiting to see what she would do.  Then, he stood, his gaze now on the entrance to the cave and shuddered, knowing what was to come of her in a moment.  Catching his shaking fear, she turned and moaned, her voice filled with despair.  <i><strong>NO!</strong>  Stop it from coming, Artimus!  Just once would I like to remain.</i><br /><br />
<br><BR>She raised her arms, shouded in the black spider silk clothe and dropped into a huddle.  Her knees pressed against her chest; her face buried in the clothe, and she cried.<br /><br />
<br><BR>Artimus watched, not able to stop her, so he stepped back against the wall.</p><br />
