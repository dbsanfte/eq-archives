<b><font color="white">How to make a Successful Guild</font></b><br><br>

1. KNOW WHAT YOU WANT!<br>
This cannot be streesed enough, and it is also the place where the vast majority of people stumble. A guild is a gathering of people who have come togther for a PURPOSE. You need to ask yourself what this purpose will be, it could be roleplaying, it could be powergaming, it could be to play Sand Giant Football, but above all, make very sure that your guild has a purpose that goes above and beyond the normal camp-kill-loot routine in EQ. 
If your guild doesn't have a fixed purpose, then it is little more than an extra chat channel to communicate with people. And lets face it, if that is the kind of guild you make, then its succes is purely dependent on the people you get in the guild, and if there are no enough people who are of the sort that you want, then your guild will fall apart in less than 3 months, give or take a month.
A Friends Guild as we shall call them, has no purpose other than to bring people into contact with others. And remember this: 90% of all guild are of the Friends sort, what makes you think that YOUR guild will be so special that people would want to join it ? Always look around your server and see if there is a niche that your guild can fill, and if there isn't, then surply and demand will ensure that your guild won't last long.
<br><br>
2. Get the right sort of people to be founding members<br>
I have seen far to many potential guildmasters go around hunting for temporary founding members in the faith that once the guild is created then the new members will come like rain during a storm.
Wrong.
A lot depends on your founding members, a lot more than you might think at first. Your founding members are what will attract other people, especially if your guild is a Friends Guild. Firstly, you should ensure that your founding members are of the player type that you want to have in the guild. If you are making a roleplaying guild, then you should of course have roleplayers and so forth. 
And most importantly: Make very sure that a number of your founding members are ACTIVE players and guildmembers. This is another major issue. If you have finally created a guild for a very specific purpose above that of the normal boredom of EQ, then your greates assest is active members who share in your vision and likes to participate in what the guild has to offer.
Take a roleplaying guild for instance, if I create a roleplaying guild then the people in it should be someone who likes to drop what they are doing at a moments notice and come join me in an roleplaying event. There is nothing worse than members who are 'busy' elsewhere camping or holding a spawn when you have finally managed to create a special event just for them, be it a special raid, a roleplaying event or a game of Sand Giant Football.
Also, your founding members will be the ones who will do the majority of recruiting, and if they are enshusiastic about their guild then they will find ways to transmit that enthusiasm to potential recruits.
<br><br>
3.Do something!<br>
Having said that, try seeing it from a regular guildmembers perspective, they have joined a guild, possibly rejecting other guildoffers in order to be in your guild, they will expect to be entertained.
One of the worst crimes that you can commit to a newly founded guild is not to do anything. Your members will expect something fun to be in the pipeline, don't dissapoint them.
If you don't have something for your members to do, then they will quickly get bored and go off on their regular camp-kill-loot routine, from where there is not far to leaving your guild.
<br><br>
4.Prepare for the casualties<br>
No matter how good a leader you are or how special your guild is, people will drop out for one reason or another. This is something that you must prepare for. Be certain that you can survive the resulting drop in members. I estimate that unless you are very lucky indeed. After a month then you will have lost 1/3 to 1/2 of your original members, depending on how well you have entertained them. 
So make sure that you recruit enough people before you found your guild that you are certain that you can carry out your purpose. A guild created for the sole purpose of raiding Hate every week or holding a Sand Giant Football match every weekend has a certain minimum on its memberbase in order to succes in its purpose, and if nothing else then there is that dreaded 10-accounts minimum before your guild will face the possibility of being forcefully disbanded.
<br><br>
5.Be there for them<br>
Being guildmaster is a lot of work, don't take the job unless you are certain you can handle it. A guild cannot run itself, there will always be issues where your presence will be required or your judgement will be wanted. 
Don't ever leave your members alone for too long, if you do, you will create a leadership crisis in the guild. I have been in a guild where we practically never saw our guildmaster or any of our officers. The guild was not succesfull and quickly fell apart due to a lack of leadership. If you create it, then you must guide it too.
And unless you have been seriously luckly in finding officers, then don't rely on your officers to be able to steer the guild on their own. Always assume the worst, then you can breathe a sigh of relief later. Which leads me nicely to:
<br><br>
6. Communication<br>
Make sure that before you create the guild you have a means of getting the members togther offline. A website and message board is essensial, especially the message board. Find a place where you can host your website, its not difficult, free homepages can be held in many places. I use geocities ( www.geocities.com )
And for message boards, the most common one in use seems to be Ezboard ( www.ezboard.com )
<br><br>
7. Advertise your presence<br>
If you have read through all this and despite my warnings have decided to create your guild or perhaps even done so already, then make sure you make others aware of your presence. Advertise, post messages on practically every single message board you can get your grubby little hands on. You will take a lot of insults in the process and a lot of "Hahaha, look at the newbies". Live with it, because there will also be people who will read your message and think to themselves "Hmm, that's nice maybe I should join this guild." 
This is another reason for having a message board and website, so that potential recruits have an easier time getting in touch with you.
<br><br>
Well, being guildmaster isn't easy, but there is nothing quite like that feeling you get where you have held a succesful raid/RP-event/Football match for your guild, and all your members can back later and told you "Thanks, we had a great time, when do we do it again ?"
That, my friend, is the feeling of succes. Value it when you get it, for it doesn't come easy.
