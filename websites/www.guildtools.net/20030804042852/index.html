I'll try to answer some of your questions and concerns here for all to see.
<br><br>
<font color=#006666>"For the research indicator to be useful, you'll need to include class, 
since, say, wizard cannot research chanter only spells."</font>
<br>
Yea, that was a slight oversight on my part. I've added a class field now. If you are an Enc, Mag, Wiz, or Nec there will be a letter by your name in the research column so that viewers will not have to look at your profile to see what class you are.
<br><br>
<font color=#006666>"You might also include a check box, like the trophies one, for folks who have a skill-mod item since it would add +3-20% to their posted skill."</font><br>
I've been asked to add this several times. Here's why it probably won't happen: This site is mainly to show off a crafters acheivements. I would rather not include items to your skill that weren't made or obtained with your own skill. For example, geerlocks and the skill modifier items form the boss mobs in luclin. If you wish to let people know you have these, that's what your notes section is for.<br><br>
<font color=#006666>"If there could be some way to specify alt's skills and tie them to the main's char, that would be helpful."</font><br>
This is more of a design 'feature' (read: flaw).<br>
When I first started making this, I was certain no one in their right mind would want to slave away at tradeskills on more than one character! Boy, was I wrong. It's not a majority, but apparently some of you crazy folk have multiple crafters. I didn't consider the older crafters that wanted to go over 200 in many skills but didn't have the option of aa =(.<br>
So, let's consider this a design 'feature'. I'm not going to have the time to modify the script to allow multiple characters per account. So what I propose you do is just make one character and add your skills to him/her, with a note stating that "No, this Ogre doesn't have a tinkering skill of 153. That would be my Gnome Snakfurphatty" or... something.
<br><br>
Please keep the feedback coming. It'll only make the site better. (hopefully)<br></td></tr></table><br><table width=80% cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td class=title height=22><b>EQCrafters</b> - Trophies - 06-06-2003</td></tr><tr><td class=border>Added checkboxes for the 10 types of trophies.<br>
Checking the appropriate box will make that skill appear bold and blue in the crafters list.<br>

I tried for one guild and it took almost an hour, and the only thing they were able to retain was the members Name, Class, Race, and Level. So, it's faster overall if you just have your members re-enter their information.<br>
What I can do is copy over your password and css file so that they don't have to sign up again, and so you don't have to redo all the colors.<br>
If you would like this done go ahead and sign up for 6 then shoot me an email.

RDB6 is customizable to the point where it can be used for many different games. I will be adding click and go templates to the field layout wizard that will transform your RDB into a basic template for the game you want. Then you can customize and modify it from there however you want. The only current template is for Everquest, but more will be coming very soon.
<br>
I will put out some how-to documentation as soon as I have time to write it.<br></td></tr></table><br><table width=80% cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td class=title height=22><b>RDB</b> - R5 - 03-25-2003</td></tr><tr><td class=border>EQRDB5 is done(ish).<br>
Pretty much the same as 4, with some new things thrown in since you can't download it.<br>
- Added a field layout editor where you can either choose to show or hide all fields (except name) in the listing. You can also specify how wide you want the table to be, how wide each column should be, the names of 5 misc fields (add your own VT key colum now) the name of your roster, and the colors of alternating fields.<br><br>
The instant signup "seems" to work. I found a few bugs right after I changed it, but I think I caught all the major ones.

Forums are YaBB Gold 1.2 which I think you'll find are very slick. <br>When you sign up for a forum you become the admin - gaining complete control over categories, layout, users, privacy and a few more goodies.<br><br>
Forums are limited to guild use for online games. Any deviation will result in board removal.

A php/mysql dkp database that will be available for hosting. You can check out the features when I roll out the dkp site.<br><br>
EQIDB 2<br>
Going to finish this up and get it available for hosting.<br><br>
SWGRDB?<br>
Had a request for a Star Wars Galaxies roster-ma-doodle. Would be very easy to convert r4 to pretty much any game, so I may offer this for hosting as well.<br><br>
R5?<br>
Had the idea of allowing users to decide what fields they want in their roster database when they sign up for hosting, then building the script from that input. So, if you wanted the timezone field you could add it, or if you didn't want the email field you could remove it. Would be really messy... sounds fun =)<br><br>
