<b><font color="white">Guild Policy</font></b><br><br>

To avoid chaos and to limit the amount of "Political Mumbo Jumbo", you need to have a good policy and procedures in place. If person 'x' does something against the policies, and if you have been looking for a reason to remove person 'x', you can always fall back on your rules. I always made it a rule of mine NOT to ever remove someone, just because I didn't like him or her. I had to have a reason, and it had to be a valid reason. Owning and running a guild should not be a "Popularity Contest", you shouldn't recruit 'cookie cutter' members, and throw out those people who perhaps are different than you. I believe that the best guild is a diverse guild, as each person adds a flavor and value to your community. Also, if you get in the habit of ruling without any form of order, you will not only lose members, but you will never see any new ones either. Let me correct myself, you will get members, but they will be the antisocial types who didn't cut it in another guild that DID have good rules and enforced them. 
To help get you on your way, I would like to cut and paste the policies that the LOA created so long ago. This was a work in progress for MONTHS, and it evolved over time. We removed things that didn't work, and added things that needed to be enforced. On our application form, we specifically asked if the person applying read the rules and policies. This is to cover our butts should we later choose to remove him/her from the guild based on their actions. 
Before moving on, I wanted to point something out. Our application form is located at the BOTTOM of our policy page. This is so that people HAVE to at least see the page before finding the link to join.  
<br><br>
The Sample Policy - Feel Free to Modify for Your Guild 
<br><br>
The Lost Order of Akalabeth's Mission Statement:<br>
The Lost Order of Akalabeth is a Guild devoted to role-playing and ensuring the maximum enjoyment of Ultima Online for as many of the people within the Ultima multiverse as possible. We strive to uphold all the Virtues within the game, and keep ourselves above reproach. We are a Guild firmly rooted in the concept of "Goodness" for all that the term implies. We do not condone mindless player killing, and as such shun all those who participate in player killing, yet neither are we a Guild of bounty hunters or revenge extractors and do not require our members to participate in such activities. We see the Lost Order of Akalabeth as a large family, and actively encourage all members to assist each other whereever possible, within the constraints of the game and our policies.
<br><br>
Village Policies:<br>
The Lost Order of Akalabeth should maintain at least one series of buildings for the use of all members. The upkeep of these buildings will be the responsibility of the Guild Treasurer and the Guild Leader. A responsible member of the Platinum Enforcers unit will be designated to be in charge of the security of these buildings. 
<br><br>
Guild Equipment:<br>
All members of the Guild are encouraged to donate surplus equipment to the Guild. This surplus equipment will be catalogued and overseen by the Guild Quartermaster who is responsible for the distribution of this equipment to Guild members who require it. The Quartermaster will also be responsible for the furnishing of Guild owned buildings.
<br><br>
Policy on Player Killing and Murderers:<br>
The unjustified killing of other players by members of the Guild is and will not be tolerated by the Guild, and conversely the Guild will not tolerate any other players who engage in this activity. While we believe that such crimes should not go unpunished, we as a Guild do not see ourselves as the Judge, Jury, nor Executioners in such matters. Because of this we do not enforce it upon our members to hunt player killers, and neither do we condemn those members who choose to do so. We see this matter as one of personal choice, and will do all within our power to see that the hunting of player killers remains so.
<br><br>
Policy on Looting (New):<br>
We simply ask that you exercise good judgement when you loot from a monster felled during a combined effort on the behalf of you and fellow members of our Order. It is good practice to give whatever you can to help your fellow brethren, this is a great sign of compassion and charity, and is highly valued in our Order.
During Dungeon Campaigns, designated 'looters' will be assigned. If you join a Dungeon Crawl, you must abide by these rules. You are *not* to loot during this time. When you all return safely to our compound, the entire horde of treasure *will be* shared by all those who attending the mission. Excess equipment *should be* donated to the Ring of Merchants, or to a less fortunate member of our Order.
This Order is rich in resources, the key to our success is sharing and making sure that everyone is taken care of. Thank you for adhering to this policy.
<br><br>
Becoming an Initiate of the Order:<br>
Before you become an Initiate of this Guild, many things must first take place. We need you to fill out the Application Form for our review. After that, we ask that you visit our IRC room, on DALnet (Instructions are including below). We want to meet you in that chat room, and see what your personality is like. Based on that, we will meet up with you IN game, and see how you behave/act when in different situations. This step can take days or weeks, that depends on the impression you make with our members.
We look for several characteristics in a person AND his online persona. To name just a few, we seek those who are loyal, dedicated, honorable, responsible, professional, caring, brave, honest, giving, and this list goes on and on. If you believe in these things, you are one step ahead of becoming a member to our Order.
The Pre-Initiation Phase takes as long as needed. It is really up to you. If you are IN game lot, and follow the policies, and strive to better the entire guild, you will find that the rewards are sweeter than you could have ever imagined. By giving your time and loyalty to our Order, you will find that our members will always be there for you, through thick and thin. If you do not put forth a strong effort to participate, we will drop you from the Initiate Phase, and say goodbye to you. The key to this stage is getting to know our members, and striving to show them that you are a team player. Also, make sure that you ask them to report your actions and deeds to the High Council - this helps us keep track of your good faith and participation.
The only way to become an Initiate, is when four (4) members of the Lost Order of Akalabeth finally vouch for you. People have been known to get vouched for in 3 days, others have taken 3 weeks. This method is one that we believe in, and it helps filter out people who are not responsible enough to wear the title of the Lost Order. Please, do not think that we are a conceited guild, I know that it may sound that way. Our members love the fact that they belong to a guild that takes pride in every aspect of the game and our following. When you enter our ranks, you will see that THIS guild is very different from the others. 
During the Initiate Phase, you will be treated as an equal. You are considered a member of our Order, but still need to polish up on Guild Training and your activeness within our Fold. Simply attend meetings, missions and constantly display the characteristics expected of our members. Within days, you will be assigned the Level One rank, and be removed from Initiate Status.
I wish you good luck, friend! Maybe in time, you too will wear the title of the Lost Order. Until that day, I fare thee well.
