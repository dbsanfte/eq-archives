<b><font color="white">Squeaky Guild</font></b><br><br>

If you haven't figured out how to successfully market your clan/guild/order yet, then you need to read this article. If you are famous, gaining new members each month, and aren't worried about your guilds future - then you can skip this one. 
<br><br>
When it comes to advertising/marketing your 'guild', you must be energetic, creative, and aggressive - always looking for a way to get YOUR GUILD NAME and URL onto a high-traffic site. Period. Once you are in the limelight, the magic will begin. There are a few things that must be done to attract attention to yourself, your guild, your members, your stories, (you get the picture), etc. 1.) You must have something WORTH sharing with the community, 2.) You need to be creative and detailed with whatever it is you are sharing, 3.) You should make sure that you provide all the necessary information, 4.) If possible, you should make sure that your 'news article' is cleanly written, spell checked and perhaps "HTML READY". I have learned from MANY news sites that the reporters LOVE IT when someone submits articles/news that already contains the correct HTML coding. They will love you, and they will usually post your news without a hitch.
<br><br>
Something Worth Sharing: <br>
News sites aren't usually interested in the fact that your guild is, "Now Recruiting!" or "Open for business!!" - who cares. News sites want to know about events - both guild and game related, creativity involving the game - such as your tales of adventure or something wonderful that is worth sharing with the rest of the community. Also, news sites are very interested in your discoveries - such as new spells, game systems, artifacts, hidden levels and so on. If you can use this to 'structure' your news in a way that it appeals to any of those categories, you are almost in business. You see, if your guild is planning a nice event, you can either advertise on your guild page and attract a small audience (usually your own members/allies), or you can think big and have it appear on a news site, attracting hundreds (possibly thousands) of people. If your guild has created a guide, resource, program, map, spell listing, or some other 'useful' information that the community should see, that is also a GREAT way to indirectly advertise your guild and get THOUSANDS and thousands of visits (which will indirectly lead to people asking about membership into your guild/clan - trust me). 
<br><br>
The hardest part about recruiting and growing your guild is becoming "KNOWN" to the community. Once people become familiar with your name and web address, the rest is pretty much easier. Your guild's management team (officers, council, 'whatever') should be aggressively seeking new places and methods to get guild related news posted to the community. Like the title of this article says, "The Squeaky Guild Gets the Grease", meaning that if a guild is visible enough and creative enough, they will get the "members" and "fame".
<br><br>
You Need to be Creative, Detailed & Provide All the Information <br>
As you draft your news article, keep in mind that you want to share this with several news sites for that game. You want the news to be clear, concise and very informative. If you have someone in your guild who is GOOD at writing, perhaps have him/her write up all your guild ads. If you have someone good at HTML, let them take that ad and make it LOOK nice for forums and news sites. Make sure your news items ALWAYS provide a link back to your guild's web site, contains an email address for a guild contact person, and always sign off with your guild's name written out (along with your guild's abbreviation). This will help with your visibility and the awareness that the community will have for your organization. 
<br><br>

If planning an event, make sure you share the vital information: Time, Date, Location, Reason for the event, Possible prizes to be given away, various events/games that will be held, etc. If your event is "ROLEPLAY ORIENTED", perhaps provide a mini-write-up for it, giving a taste of what it is all about. If you make it interesting enough and build the suspense, people WILL attend.
<br><br>
Spell Check and HTML Ready! <br>
Once you write your news item and reread it to yourself a few times to make sure it is accurate, you should then SPELLCHECK your writing and add the HTML to it. I usually add the HTML elements AFTER I write the news/article. 
<br><br>
After the news is ready to go, I send a copy of it to myself via email, and then place that 'ad' in a folder called, "Guild Ads". That way, if the event is recurring, I will have a copy on file. 
<br><br>
Other Topics: Email Addresses for News Sites & Guild Advertising <br>
Let's say that you are playing Asheron's Call and everything you do as a guild revolves around that game. Your news will be for AC related sites, your guild advertising will be for AC players, etc. You should go out and find ALL of the PREMIUM news sites and keep a list of the email addresses used to submit news for each of them. Once you complete this task, email it to yourself (for a copy in your files) for future use. That way, when you have new news to announce, you won't have to VISIT each site to get the word out. 
<br><br>
(TIP: Send INDIVIDUAL EMAILS to each news site. I think that as a news site staff member, it is a turn-off to see the names of '5' other news agencies on the same message. I realize this takes a little more time, but it will be well worth it.) 
<br><br>
Throughout this article I focused on Guild Event/News Items, but didn't really mention anything about good, old fashioned "Guild Ads". I love well written guild ads, they are VERY IMPORTANT in the grand scheme of things. As with other news that you will be writing, make sure you write the ad first, spell check it, add the HTML, then mail a copy to yourself for your files. 
<br><br>
(TIP #1: Before going on your Guild Advertising Campaign and posting your newly written guild ad, make sure you first TEST IT on your own forum. You will save yourself some embarrassment should there be errors with your HTML. Once you SEE your ad looking good, go ahead and cut/paste it onto other forums.)
<br><br>
(Tip #2: While visiting all of the "GUILD ORIENTED" forums, record the URL for those forums into an email message and send it to yourself - yep, for your files! In the future, it will save TONS OF TIME when you go to advertise again.) 
When advertising, please make sure you keep your guild ads to the 'Guild Forums'. If you don't, you will DEFINITELY upset the natives and your ad will lose it's effectiveness. Also, it is an embarrassment for your guild, trust me... I know firsthand. (The learning process can be SO difficult) 
The nice thing about Guild Forums is that they are less traveled and posted on. That means that your ads will persist for days, weeks, even months! People tend to visit guild forums to have a look... read a few posts, then move on. I posted ads about 7 months ago for our EQ faction and I am STILL receiving site visits from that ad! Amazing... it goes to show you that your ads DO work, if you stick to the rules. 
<br><br>
(Tip #3: Get tracking services right now for your site. I highly recommend "Extreme Tracking", a free service that monitors your site and records information about visitors. It is what I use to find out where people are learning about our guild, or who is talking about us (and posting our URL). I love sneaking up on a guild message board and replying to a post someone made about me or the guild I am involved in. It makes me feel... well... KEWL. For the URL to Extreme Tracking, visit: <"http://www.gamecore.net/brimstone> <http://www.gamecore.net/brimstone> and click on the "Resources" link.) 
In the end, it is all about being persistent and aggressive with your guild advertising. You must constantly be working on ways to get your NAME (guildname) onto a site that has a TON of traffic. If you aren't doing this, you will not grow as fast as you possibly can... nor will you attract some of the super-creative members of the gaming community. <br>
(Warning: Once your guild is in the spotlight a few times and people are aware of your existence, DO expect to have ANTI-SOCIAL players applying for your guild/clan. It happens. Like leeches, they hop from one host to another looking out for themselves and nobody else. Avoid them like the plague and someday they will grow up and be QUALITY members of a guild.)
