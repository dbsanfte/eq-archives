<b><font color="white">Six things to avoid</font></b><br><br>

Hello I am a 55 unguilded wizard. I just recently left my last guild for numerous reasons and became curious if such problems existed within all such guilds.
<br><br>
1) Cliques. Within the guild were groups of people who only interacted with each other and no one else unless there was something in it for them.
<br><br>
2) Silence. Whether it was an attempt to garner opinions, see what people were doing, or make CR plans, most of the guild would not respond to questions that concerned even all members. One simply was met with a sense of indifference, which I interpreted as not caring. This ranged from guild chat to guild forums.
<br><br>
3) Grouplessness. Regardless of having open spots, guild members would not invite other guild members into xp groups. Not even if all essential roles were filled, and a slot was open. Not even if all group members were guild members (see my first point). XP came first, guild members second.
<br><br>
4) Leaders. Or the lack thereof rather. When it came to raiding the attitude was "you lead it." So basically, no help on leading any raids where you want to go unless it served the needs of others who knew the zone well enough to lead it. When someone with little or no experience in leading raids (or a desired zone) would attempt to do so, members would openly complain about how poorly organized the raid was and how they hated having their time wasted by someone who didn't know what they were doing.
<br><br>
5) Selfishness. Guild members (and a good deal of them) always put themselves before the guild. Most members would only be willing to raid in zones where there were ph@t L3wtz for themselves. When a raid on a specific zone was announced, it'd often be met with "does insertclasshere stuff drop?" This also went so far as not helping other guild members on CR, refusal to attend raids, help on epic camps, etc. Even after help had been openly requested from other members.
<br><br>
6) The six hour guild. The guild was only actually a guild around the peak times. Any raids or plans had to coincide within the small window of having enough people on to do anything. Outside of this time range, you could count the number of members online with one hand and still usually have fingers left over. To add to this, many members were very casual players, so while the guild may have had up to 60 members, one would be lucky to find even 15 on at any one time. Guild raids were ALWAYS short on essential classes, and in return most were cancelled or ended early (usualy after the first wipeout proved we were shorthanded).
<br><br>
There were more problems, but more understandable ones that I think would relate to day to day politics and such that comes with the prior problems listed or what I could foresee with any large grouping of people. The problems I've stated affected me as well as other members who had been guilded even longer than myself. For the life of me I couldn't figure out why they hadn't left already. While there, I attempted to help out and make things better in the few ways I could, but it was an overwhelming uphill battle. One grows tired of trying to help those who either don't want it or don't care.
<br><br>
My question is, am I naive for thinking that these problems aren't common to all or most guilds? Are my expectations too high of a guild? Did I simply join a "bad" guild? Are there guilds that raid more than once a week that don't have these problems? Or at least to this degree? And if so, are they accepting 55 wizards?
<br><br>
Thank you for your time and consideration.
