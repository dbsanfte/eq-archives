	EQ Profiles Debut ~ EQ Profiles ~ 01-30-2004</td></tr>
	<tr><td class=border>EQ Profiles is basically an extension to EQ Crafters that allows players to add more information about their characters to the still sortable and searchable database. One of the best new features this site offers is something called Mageloid. With this utility you can quickly add or update your profile with a few clicks of a button. 
<br><br>
EQ Profiles will also offer guild support. This means that anyone who attaches your guildname to their profile will be part of a dynamic roster available to your guild. The myguild page allows an admin for your guild to change the CSS and layout of the roster. At a later date more options will be added (customized fields, html enabled, etc). <br><br>Here are two example for MyGuild: <A href="http://www.eqprofiles.net/myguild.php?guild=Fires+of+Heaven">Fires of Heaven</a> ~ <a href="http://www.eqprofiles.net/myguild.php?guild=Afterlife">Afterlife</a><br><br>
You will also be able to view other characters on your server or in other guilds with normal site tools. The server and guild lists show you visually the stats, tradeskills, resists, and flags those characters have.<br><br> Here's an example of a server list: <a href="http://www.eqprofiles.net/profiles.php?server=Mithaniel+Marr">Mithaniel Marr</a><br><br>
You can also access a profile of your character with a customizable background (more features coming soon). I have intentionally made the profile to match Magelo's layout so that you can use your background for that if you wish. <br><br>Here's an example of a profile: <a href="http://www.eqprofiles.net/profile.php?id=1128">Grimiz Agaud</a><br><br>
I hope you will like this new site, and I look forward to all feedback and/or death threats.<br><br>
For those of you changing from EQ Profiles to RDB I hope to make the move as worthwhile as possible. Please let me know if there is anything you need added or changed.

You can now add a percentage to your skills to represent a geerlock or another item which affects your skills. For now, it will only show up on your profile page, and it will go above 252 even though that is the cap. I will change the cap problem eventually but I doubt the modified skill will ever be added to the server lists.</td></tr></table><br><br>

	Newsletter ~ Guildtools Network ~ 11-14-2003</td></tr>
	<tr><td class=border>Hello Everyone!<br><br>

I wanted to take this opportunity to go over some of the tools that are available to you through the website and also discuss some projects that have been sitting on the back burner for a bit. I would also like to request feedback from you on current tools and encourage you to request others that are not currently offered. Finally, I have a personal request that some or many of you may be able to help me fulfill.
<br><br>
As many of you know, the Guildtools site has been around for a few years now. I'm glad to say most of the tools that I offer have been received favorably by the majority, with minimal death threats and hate mail. =) As always, the site has been running free and without banners or pop-up ads since day one, something you won't find many sites doing out of their own generosity in this age of information overload.
<br><br>
EQ Crafters <br>
This is my most recent (completed) project. It allows the players of Everquest to add their characters tradeskill abilities to a database that can then be searched sorted and sautéed (ok, well... you can't eat it, but 2 out of 3 isn't bad!) Some people add their characters for fame seeking out the elusive 1750 club, others add their character to increase their fortune. No matter the reason, I'm proud to announce we have over 750 very skilled crafters in the database now. I do hope we can break a thousand before the new year, so spread the word to your friends and guilds!
http://eqcrafters.guildtools.net
<br><br>
RDB<br>
Roster Database. This was the first tool the site ever had, and after many revisions it's finally gotten to the point where another version would be pointless. RDB is currently only available for hosting. But the 50 guilds and 2,800 members who use it don't seem to mind! =) Setting up the RDB is painless and instant, anyone can do it.
http://rdb.guildtools.net
<br><br>
Forums<br>
There is room for maybe 1 or 2 more large guild forums, or 5 or 6 small guild forums. So, if your guild is looking for a free forum for its members then sign up quickly. Forum requests are also created instantly, so it's fcfs. All forums must be for online gaming use only. No exceptions. Currently there are 14,500+ posts in 15 forums with 700+ members.
http://forums.guildtools.net
<br><br>
Articles<br>
One of the least used resources on the site is the Articles section. There are many good articles in this area that a guild could and should take advantage of. You are able to vote on articles, and those that drop below a 2 in rating will be removed form the site. If you would like to submit an article to the site please send it in an email to grim@guildtools.net.

The Backburner<br>
A few projects have been sitting in the wings for a while now. Any feedback (positive or negative) on these would really help me get these things out or trash them for good.
DKP - Quite a few guilds in EQ use DKP to keep track of raids and member attendance at them. There is already one very good source for a DKP program http://www.eqdkp.com but that site does not host the database for you. My version would be hosted by the site but not available for download.
IDB - Item Database. This would be similar to RDB, except it would be used for... items. This is one of those projects that I could easily finish on a rainy weekend, but I'm just not sure how many guilds would have a use for one of these.
Signature Hosting - I really doubt I will bring this back, it's just a massive bandwidth hog. If I did, it would add a small hosted by tag to it much like strike9 does.
Site Hosting - I've toyed around many times with the idea of making a portal type system for guilds much like guildportal and umm that other one do. Except, mine would be without all the banners and costs and it would actually look nice. (no offense) If you think this would be a good idea, give me a push. 
<br><br>
Personal Request<br>
If you own a small business, or if you work for a non-profit organization (especially one that helps a community or group of people) and you would like to increase (or even begin) your web presence, please feel free to contact me.
<br><br>
I'm looking to work on projects ranging from a few hours, to several weeks, from simple html or banners to backend databases that house a large amount of information. ALL LABOR WILL BE FREE. Minus any hosting costs your company may incur. I'd be glad to speak with you on what I think a reliable host should provide.
<br><br>
My current skills include:<br>
HTML<br>
ASP<br>
ADO<br>
PHP<br>
MySQL<br>
SQL Server 2000<br>
Flash<br>
Photoshop<br>
<br><br>
If you are interested, please send an email to amiller@guildtools.net and include the following information. <br>
Name<br>
Phone<br>
Company/Business Description<br>
Project Requested<br>
<br><br>
Why would I do this? I'm looking to add a few things to my resume that will soon be floating around out there again. So, drop me a line and let's talk about what I can do for you. You will not be obligated to use the end product, and you will be consulted through all phases of development. 
<br><br>
Until next time,
<br><br>
-Grim
