<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">-Begin Rant-

Intersting thread.  I really never post here, and the only reason I am choosing to now is because of the worth in this thread.  There is a ton of bullshit, but also some very well thoughout rants.

Mr. Smedley, I think EQ is amazing. What it has done is second to none.  Not only have I played EQ exclusivly for over a year now, but I have purchased only one other game in this amount of time.  EQ truly opened the door to multiplayer RPG's.  I know it wasn't the first, but it's success is seen in the business world.  success like this is going to push more money into EQ and other new online RPGs.

With that said I have to say nothing is perfect.  Of all people I think you would agree Everquest is a work in progress.  The additions the team at Verant has added to this game have truly added life into something that started very rigid.  I have always wanted more interface changes more than I wanted Buffs to classes.  With Velious the added movable boxes was genious.  Afterall no one interface is going to be completly universal.  The added scripting abilties were a huge bonus, now pullers dont run in with 3 yellow mobs to a group that only knows the puller is Inc!.  

Yet there are things I truly still see as problems with EQ.  The biggest being the Alt-Tab issue.  I have Cable internet access, and I always keep my AOL Instant messenger on.  I do this because often people will leave me messages that I can read at a later time.  Unfortunatly I have to remember to shut off AIM and any other program that might create a popup while playing EQ because although the screen can minimize, It cannot come back up.  I am not sure exactly what this does to keep people from hacking.  maybe you dont want people from going to EQAtlas while they are exploring a new dungeon or something, but for me it is a real pain in the ass.

I also admit I have cheated.  I have used Asheran's emu, and Windowed EQ.  I have never presonally hacked into the program and used the speed hack, or setup a linux box and used SEQ.  No offense Asheran the emu in it's present state is nothing Verant should be worried about.  Although I get a kick out of looking at an emptly lower guk, or the layout of veeshan's peak.  I don't think I get any kind of advantage over someone else, afterall the emu doesnt show spawn locations, spawn types, or toughness of mobs.  In fact fighing isnt even implemented yet.  As for the item portion of the emu, anyone can go to Eqlizer or Alkazam's and see the latest and greatest items.  The now defunct Windowed EQ program was also fairly buggy, although I uesed it for normal hunting and whatnot, any raid type events I always shut it off (As a cleric anytime EQ crashes is certain disruption for the raid).

With that said I haven't used any cheat program in over 6 months so I am not worried about you banning my character (If I was going to be banned I would have already).  Mr. Smedley in EQ you are given warnings when you do something that is consdered cheating.  Why is it that you cannot warn people that they are going to get banned for doing something outside of the game.  I know you have a user agreement that states about 1 million things, one being not to hack the game, and common sense would tell most people doing this is going to get you in trouble.  I for one was considering trying the speed hack just for the sake of trying it.  I don't want a unfair advantage over other players but I like to see what is in my ability and what isn't when It comes to computers (after all I am majoring in the subject).

I would love to voice my opinon about what else would make the the game much more enjoyable, but I think this post is long enough already.

(yes different accounts but if you put some time into it you could easily obtain my currnet account information and ban me for the things I admitted to doing in this post, but I pray you take what I say in context and use your judgement.)

*Oh and feel free to flame me for kissing up to the Mr. Smedely if you think that is what I did, I don't plan on posting anything else to this thread.*
