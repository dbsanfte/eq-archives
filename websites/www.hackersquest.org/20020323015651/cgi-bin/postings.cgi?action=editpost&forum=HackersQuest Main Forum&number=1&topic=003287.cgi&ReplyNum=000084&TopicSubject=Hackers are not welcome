<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">Heh, what a nice opportunity.  I get to write a nice message here and JS is guaranteed to read it.

I don't use any of the hacks because...I like my account.  Not because of some moral dilemma, mind you, this is purely a fear of punishment.  I know you guys can track hack users if you really put your mind to it, so why take a chance with characters I've been playing with for two years, right?

I am however an avid SEQ user.  Barring self revealing actions in-game, I am 100% sure you could not detect SEQ unless you attacked and broke into my LAN.

I first heard about SEQ about a year ago.  I didn't pay it much attention, with the WinSEQ version out the window and me not having any unix boxes on my LAN.

This changed when I got myself a used laptop and threw Mandrake on it.  Following the instructions found on these very forums I had SEQ up and running in an hour.  Now I was ready to "cheat".

Let me digress for a moment and mention that I've been playing online games for a long time now.  I was (and still am) an avid Quake player, Tribes, Starcraft, what have you.  A lot of these (if not most) games have cheats available to them, from aimbots and see-through walls to unlimited resource hacks and character manipulation (Diablo).  I was never compelled to use these cheats.  If I logged onto a game of Quake and saw someone shooting rockets out of their ass, I would find a different server.  If I thought someone was cheating in any of the online games I played, I would quit that game and find another with honest players. 

This brings me back to EQ.  Never for a moment did I hesitate when offered a chance to use SEQ.  Instead I leapt into it with joy.  What makes EQ different from all the other games I played?

It's the persistance.

I log on to my server, and there are about 2000 peeps playing.  These are the same people I see day after day.  Every time I log on I see MageX and WarriorY and RogueZ doing their thing.  Due to the nature of the game, being so item-centric and all, I am competing for a scarce resource (items) with the same people day after day.

Now, I know that a certain number of people have SEQ on my server.  Pulling numbers out of my ass, I will assume that about 100-200 of the 2000 people out there are running it. This means that every time I head over to camp some item there is a small chance that someone with SEQ is going after the same thing I am.  You know very well who has the advantage here.

My dilemma now is this:  I can leave things as they are and resign myself to the fact that some people out there are going to have an advantage over me, or I can join the minority SEQ-using population.

Tell me John, what would YOU do, being an ordinary player?

It seems to me that Verant is responsible 
for SEQ.  There is a famous quote somewhere out there about not leaving anything on the client because the client is in the hands of the enemy.  Unfortunately Verant decided to do just that, and as a result there is a whole host of information flowing through the client which is just asking to be sniffed and decoded.  

I am not concerned with the reasons why Verant chose that route.  I am only concerned with the practical effect, which is that a small percentage of EQ players are privvy to ALL the data in the client, whereas the rest get a fraction.

Again, I am not concerned with the technical aspects of this.  I really don't care what kind of hoops Verant would have to jump through in order to "fix" SEQ.  All I am concerned about is that Verant has known about SEQ for a long while and had decided to do nothing about it (well the unix version anyway heh).  Apparently Verant figures the proportion of SEQ users is too small (or at least that is the perception of the general playing population, which is pretty much all Verant cares about) to warrant any action.  

Thus Verant itself has given us a two-tiered system of playing EQ.  You can play EQ, or you can play EnhancedEQ.  It all depends on your own resources (unix box and a LAN) and persistance.

You can throw ethics and morals at me until you are blue in the face.  Tell me I am "cheating" the non-SEQ enabled players.  Tell me that I have an "unfair" advantage. 
My response is that the onus is on you, Verant.  You have consciously and deliberately given us a game which rewards people who sniff your client data and you have done NOTHING about it.  For years.

Through your inaction you have allowed a small minority of people to get an "advantage" over others AND you allow this to continue.  In essence you are screwing over people who do not have SEQ by not releasing a client which has SEQ functionality, knowing full well that there exist many many others who already have that advantage.

If you do not want to release a client which competes with SEQ, and you obviously do not want to allocate resources to 'fixing' the problem (I'll believe it when I see it thank you), then the status quo will continue.

Your continual unwillingness to deal with the problem suggests acquiescence on your part.

In summary: I use SEQ only because I perceive a large number of others do too.  You are either "in" or you are "out", and I want to be "in".  Verant can eliminate the "in", but they don't.  I have no choice.
