<h1>Big Disclaimer Thing</h1>
<p>
This is Work In Progress, and we take no responsibility bla bla bla and so
on and so forth.<br />
In short; until we get a graphcis artists and someone to do the
PHP/Perl/SQL frontends this thing won't look much better than it is now ;)
If you want either of those jobs, send an email to Slicer (link below).

<h2>NanoFormulas</h2>
<p>
<a href="show.php3">Click here to view NanoFormulars</a>. Nuff said.

<h2>Database Download</h2>
<p>
Hey, share the fun and so on :)<br />
This database is actually just a sample frontend for our decoded AO
database. However, since lots of website operators out there probably want
this, we have the database in raw form available for download. You can
<a href="nf_sampl.txt">Download a sample of NanoFormulars</a> to see how
the data looks.<br />
If you want the complete database, please set up your website (or program or
whatever) first (with the sample data), and once we verify that it works,
and that you give HackersQuest proper credit, we'll arrange a download
account for you. If you think you qualify, please contact <a
href="mailto:slicer@ethernalquest.org">Slicer</a>.
