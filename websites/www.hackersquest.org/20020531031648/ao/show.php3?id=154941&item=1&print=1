<tr><th>Desc</th><td colspan="2">Please BUY this info - - - <br /><br /> Haven't we all experienced situations where our servants are unable to draw the attention of hostile beings? Have we not sometimes wished for them to be just a little more aggressive during combat? Despair no more: From the planet of CMH comes this simple invention, that by the means of everyday chemical fluids can make the most determined combatant crumble in frustration. <br /><br /> This is the procedure: Acquire a chemical impact injector, a container of XU-11 insecticide and a standard trimmer casing. You may require some help from a chemist to replace the liquid in the injector with XU-11. <br /><br /> When you have filled the injector, place it in slot 6 inside the trimmer casing. Switch off the break-proof circuit (You might need to use untraditional methods on Omni-Tek manufactured casings). Prepare the task committer using the Kruder method, and press the tri-pulse switch-table using form 661 (the 29454 revised version). Enable the pica-pump and drag the arm to the minor outlet. Adjust (20-25 degrees). You will need to remove the superfluous titan rivet inside the backward connector bulb to make room for the injector pulse moderator. If you encounter problems with the bottom winder - we recommend reading 'A Complete Guide to Robot Mechanics - Featuring All Relevant Technolgies from Both Past and Present' - by Karen Takazawa. <br /><br /> NOTE: Components of low quality are unlikely to yield any result.</td></tr>
