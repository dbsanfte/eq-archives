   <tr><th>AO::Chat</th></tr>
   <tr><td>While waiting for 12.8, I've release my <a href="chat/">AO::Chat
Perl Module</a>. Tested and working on Linux only for the time being, it
allows you to interact with the AO Chat server.<br />
Note that this is a programming library with no enduser functionality. If
you want something like a program or utilitiy, wait for someone to release
one.

   <tr><th>Database Download v2</th></tr>
   <tr><td>I now have item data available as well.. I will, however, stop answering
emails about 'can I have a copy of the database please'. The process for
getting the data is really very simple:
<ol>
<li>Create a program that converts the sample data to your own format</li>
<li>Use that for something (a webpage, program, whatever)</li>
<li>Show us the webpage/program. It must be publicly available and it must
give credits to Rubi-Quest</li>
</ol>
Once you've done that, you <b>will</b> get a copy of the data.

   <tr><th>Item Database and ClusterShopper</th></tr>
   <tr><td>I've added the item database of normal user items as well as a
clustershopper for implants. The clustershopper is .cgi for now, so doesn't
have our fancy design, but it's so usefull I thought I'd put it up here
anyway.

   <tr><th>Database Download</th></tr>
   <tr><td>To all the people emailing me: <b>Yes</b>, you can have a copy of the full
database. But <b>first</b> you need to download <a href="nf_sampl.txt">the
sample data</a> and create your website using that. Once you have done that,
contact us so we can review it, and then you'll get the full file instead of
just the sample.
