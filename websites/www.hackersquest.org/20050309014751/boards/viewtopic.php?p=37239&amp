				<td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">My involvement with IGN has come to an end, not the end I envisioned when I started working on a new version of IGN only a few months ago.
<br />

<br />
My plan was to do some changes, so the project could continue it's life until the end of Anarchy Online, by changing the bot source to support multiple people working on it and after explaining my ideas to Amona I got her blessing. 
<br />

<br />
I put my time and energy into creating IGN's SourceForge site and started development, but there was a flaw in my plan, the current IGN desperately needed a loving hand and people couldn't wait 3-6 months until I was ready to release IGN Resurrection as I jokeingly had codenamed IGNv3.
<br />

<br />
Luckily Amona had said she wished to finish IGNv2 a while ago and finally got the time to release updates, this as a side effect meant IGNv3 development had to be canceled, so the project could use the final up to date IGNv2 source as the base of it and I settled in using my time on supporting IGN users instead.
<br />

<br />
To help the users out I had created bots on all servers named ignhelp that was connected to the #IGN help channel on irc.funcom.com. With Amona updating  the bot to use it, we had  visitors from time to time, so things was running smoothly.
<br />

<br />
Then one day I suggested we use one of my planned ideas for IGNv3 in IGNv2 and all hell broke loss. I had this vision of making every possible feature availble in game, have a web version of it users could intergrate into there web site. In this case it was my plan to use the RSS standard to grab news from anywhere and have the bot news feature use that, also using the blogger api to post news created in game back to the guilds web site. 
<br />

<br />
While adding this to IGNv2 was a bad idea, to much code that could create a ton of new bugs, the reaction I got was pretty strange. I got accused of harming the IGN users in all kinds of ways, because I liked this idea and at the end of the conversation I got told that Amona would no longer support that I created IGNv3.
<br />

<br />
I offered to hand over ign.sf.net to Amona, but she refused the offer and I felt, I had no other choice but to discontinue with my work, lots of hours waisted.
<br />

<br />
I still ran ignhelp, so I ate my pride and continued on as IGN supporter, so the harm to the users of the bot was minimized.
<br />

<br />
Then came B-day, unfortunately it wasn't Birthday, but Ban Day, where Amona got banned from AO again and this time from funcoms IRC server too.
<br />

<br />
At first I had no idea what was going on, took me several days after it happened before I found out about it, I'm getting old, so I need to sleep atleast once a week these days, that was unfortunately the time when B-day happened.
<br />

<br />
*big huge stinking sigh*
<br />

<br />
Everything was going so well, atleast from the users perspective. They got bot updates and even support when we where 'alive' on IRC.
<br />

<br />
Then came Amona's post "Funcom's way of thanking ( IGN development discontinued ).", at that point I had had enough, I spend almost half a year getting things up and running again, seen most of my work killed by Amona and now she stopped IGNv2 and at a time where IGN is badly broken in game due to the latest game change.
<br />

<br />
We where abandoned by Amona yet again... yes, what happened sucked... but what the hell had the users done wrong... or any of the other people involved in supporting her work... That we just had to be left at the altar, with the impossible task of picking up the pieces without her help...
<br />

<br />
During the next days I didn't much bother hidding how upset I was, I did asure everyone that I would keep ignhelp running until the 1st January next year, should be plenty of time for someone else to get setup and take over, someone had some ideas for finding a new programmer, so things mostly settled down to a normal level and we continued to support people.
<br />

<br />
Then Funcoms server started crashing, someone had found a bug in it that could be exploited to kill it, when the problems was solved it seems the configuration was wiped, so the motd file was removed, that created a fatal situation for IGN's IRC support since it relied on the motd to join channels. I managed to hack the IRC code so it could work with or without motd (See other thread) and got the bots back online.
<br />

<br />
I saved the world and got the princess, but unfortunately thats not how the story ends,  Amonas IRC ban had also disappered and while I was away she joined, posted some long tear wet story and banned me and as a result also the 3 ignhelp bots I ran.

<br />
Since I wasn't contacted to hand over the nicks and I consider it a security risk to simply erase them, my freebie account will hold the names until the day FC decides to erase them.
<br />

<br />
My last official action was to erase myself as a channel operator, but as you might have guessed nothing works perfectly and Q didn't support it, but telling Q to ban Amona from #IGN did the job in a round about way and I had the satisfaction of being amused for around half a nano second.
<br />

<br />
I'm sorry I couldn't do more for the users of IGN, but I guess it just wasn't meant to be.

				<td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">Miravlix, there's a clear difference between personal reality, and actual reality:
<br />

<br />
First off, why can't you leave a person (me) alone, after 3 years of doing what I possibly can to satisfy the IGN users.
<br />
Second, IGN isnt "bot development", there are plenty other bots out there, just because I've been banned from a loaned account, and don't want to risk getting other loaned accounts banned by continuing work doesn't make it qualify as "abandonment".
<br />

<br />
You're definition of the situation is highly persnonal, In that you do the big mistake in assuming you know everything or know everything about the situation, in which you don't. If you did, you wouldn't been running out like a wild goose screaming doomsday like you do, and then blaming me for leaving AO/IGN when you yourself just 1 week earlier pouted about the same on ign.sf.net just because you took it personal that I don't share your technical vision for IGN (the original IGN / IGN V2) which has nothing to do with IGN resurection.
<br />

<br />
Why should I embrace a version-numeric change from XXX (ex 188) to ex 188.122.110 etc? Why make it harder for every single user just because that means its "easier" for you to store different versions fitting with sf.net's system better?
<br />

<br />
I say it again, IGN users has been used to certain visual / external concepts with IGN for years now, and I have no interest in complexing nor changing that. You've shown a complete lack of interest in the fact that the majority of IGN users might not "fit" your "world-wide" statistics of what is used/not used out there for scripters / programmers.
<br />

<br />
Sure, you might remember 9 digit versionnumbers easily on something you yourself adopt or work with, but most IGN users / botowners don't give a fuck about it enough to even want to use time nor resources nor braincells to try and remember 9 digit version numbers, or different version-numbers for every single element/module in a new IGN system?
<br />
"Oh, what version of extensions.php do you have? A: uhm.. 187.393.212, but i have bot.php version uhm..."
<br />

<br />
Get real, IGN isn't JUST about making something BETTER, but about trying to KEEP IT SIMPLE. IGN could be 10.000 times better if it were efficienciated and made more complex, with more extra modules, but then at the cost of the easy installment etc. And there's allready a dousin bots out there that allready ARE better than IGN but that are harder to install etc. So why should there be any reason/need to change IGN to comform to those standards when that's allready been covered by other bots?
<br />

<br />
IGN isnt a bot in majority for coders, scripters or IT-experts, but for the oposite, IT-dummies ( no offence to anyone, but that's why it's made the way it is, for people who don't have the TIME nor WILL to involve themselves deeply into a new language/scriptcode etc, and/or for those lazy people out there, like myself ).
<br />

<br />
Over 3 years i've been getting daily feedbacks from users of IGN, both short and long comments / discussions and what not. And yet you won't listen to that single fact at all, you pretend you know oh so much better about everything the IGN users want, just because you are an ace programmer and "know" todays standards out there in the world?
<br />
This isnt "out there", this is IGN and it's userbase and what they are used to in context to using IGN, period. And you don't respect that, you wouldnt accept that as an argument when we talked about it, and you went pouting about it on sf.net.
<br />

<br />
I didnt "refuse" to take over is.net, I declined it politely cause I said I saw no reason why i would run that any better than yourself.
<br />

<br />
Yet you went out and pouted, and started a shittingcontest behind my back for the last 2 weeks. Tha'ts not lojal or trustworthy, I would never have done that to you if the tables were turned, If i have a problem, I confront the target about it directly 10 times first, you didn't.
<br />
Using "what have I done? what damage have I done? you mean by running the help-bots? or fixing an error in ircrelay with MOTD-missing IRC-servers?"
<br />

<br />
That's like saying "I planted 3 trees, therefore I have the licence to cut down 20 and throw shit in your neck on your way out, throw out lies and what not"
<br />

<br />
Take a look around, you think you're the only one fixing things with IGN or doing good deeds? There's a dousin people in here who's done the same a tenfold and still don't act like a crybaby just because I leave IGN/AO/HQ and call it "abandonment".
<br />

<br />
I also never said you couldnt have anything to do with IGN, I said it would be best if i did my thing, then you could do anything you wanted with your own IGN development/project, and I wouldnt mind that, but I would not stop my own development if the plans were to start making central-management code into something unnecessary complex imo and start radically changing versionhistory numbering which imo would confuse the average user of IGN who's used to 3 simple digits that are fairly easy to remember.
<br />

<br />
You call me being incapacitated by Funcom abandonment? Why should I WANT to for a 4th year put myself through the misory of Funcom's twotiming backstabbing when it actually hurts me? Sometime a person needs to stop what their doing and move on, and that's what I did, and you can't accept it without furfilling an urge to shit me in the face first and talk behind my back? Where's the trust in that? How can possibly work with someoen who turns on me 180 degrees all sudden just because I don't share his technical ideas and vision?.
<br />

<br />

<br />
And then you go around spreading more lies, that I'm hurting the IGN users, that I'm leaving just to "get even" with Funcom, and that I don't give a fuck about the users. Hell, i've even asked Koi to secretly fix up any current issues with IGN so that I can in good contiuous take my leave, knowing that the users are indeed in good hands. I've left the central open even though I don't condone any use of IGN or any other bot when Funcom makes money off of it to some extent, not just from IGN, but from any bot out there, and yet I've kept the central open and running allowing the number to grow by 20+ bots each day, consuming more and more traffic on <a href="http://www.monkerud.com" target="_blank">www.monkerud.com</a> , which costs alot of money on my server-provider monthly subsrciption, right now there are 4+ million hits on the server a week, and that's with only 370 bots connected to central. If it continues to grow with 20+ each day, there will be 10+ million hits a week within 4-5 months. I have to pay for that you know, every month. But hey, I don't give a fuck about the users like you say, and I've never asked people like Koi to take care of bugs for me either, It must all be a fantasy... right.
<br />

<br />

<br />
The reason you're not wanted anymore Miravlix, is because, and I don't say this often, I thought you were my friend, and you're personally hurt my feelings when you've gone behind my back and spread out your personal opinions as-if-the-were-facts when they are indeed lies.
<br />

<br />
Don't sit there on your high horse and call me leaving IGN, or even closing the central one day if I do for "holding IGN users hostage just to get at Funcom", that's bullshit. It costs me time and money, and there's a limit to how much blood and sweat and anger I'm willing to sacrifice to keep it going. Nobody pays for IGN either, never have, and never will, so stop crying. If you don't like it, then you should have never involved yourself with IGN in the first place.
<br />

<br />
You call this nice and trustworthy? This is what you've been doing while i've been gone for a week, hoping that I'd never have to come back, if it werent for dramaqueens who just have to throw shit in people's back after they've left like you've done:

&lt;@Miravlix&gt; Xsaga: I've noted down the bug, but since Amona got herself banned again and she doesn't want me to continue the development, I'm afraid all you have is to find the workaround to get the raid command back to a level where people can use it. 
<br />
&lt;Pi&gt; mira, ign isnt gone for good... 
<br />
&lt;@Miravlix&gt; Why not PI? 
<br />
&lt;@[RK1]&gt; Seba: so raid part of the bot does not work? 
<br />
&lt;@Miravlix&gt; Amona is not going to fucking care about her users enough to release the central code. 
<br />
&lt;Pi&gt; with the success ign has had, its bound that it will be updated by someone 
<br />
&lt;Pi&gt; thast not true either mira 
<br />
&lt;@Miravlix&gt; She is going to use the bot users as hostage just as the last time 
<br />
&lt;@[RK1]&gt; Seba: huh? 
<br />
&lt;Angels|zzzzZ&gt; Either its updated or replaced  
<br />
&lt;@[RK1]&gt; Seba: couldn't someone make their own bot? 
<br />
&lt;@Miravlix&gt; Last time she got banned, she did some stuff that harmed her users 
<br />
&lt;@Miravlix&gt; Killed central and some other crap, was before my time. 
<br />
&lt;Pi&gt; seba, it wouldn't be called IGN without her consent 
<br />
&lt;@Miravlix&gt; And she has the nerve to say I don't care about her users 
<br />
&lt;@Miravlix&gt; When her users is freely availble to her to be used as hostages 
<br />
&lt;@[RK1]&gt; Seba: What is the IRC part for funcom...I am assuming that is where you are talking from? 
<br />
&lt;@Miravlix&gt; The bot has the ability to connect to IRC networks 
<br />
&lt;Pi&gt; w/e mira, you're obviously going to win this argument 
<br />
&lt;@Miravlix&gt; Pi: It's the truth 
<br />
&lt;Pi&gt; mira, no its not  
<br />
&lt;Pi&gt; what if i told you that i knew that she would be willing to give it up... 
<br />
&lt;@Miravlix&gt; She has already used the users as hostages again by her discontinued post on hackersquest 
<br />
&lt;@Miravlix&gt; So I don't see where I'm wrong even if she get some sense into her head later and does let someone else run central. 
<br />
&lt;@Miravlix&gt; If she does get someone then I will offer them ign.sf.net. 
<br />
&lt;@Miravlix&gt; and offer to erase ignhelp so they can run the help bot too. 
<br />
&lt;Pi&gt; but you woudln't help with what you know of it already? 
<br />
&lt;@Miravlix&gt; She doesn't want me to help.  
<br />
&lt;@Miravlix&gt; So what else can I do than gracefully exiting and letting someone else she likes take over. 
<br />
&lt;Pi&gt; what if the new person wanted your help to help users? 
<br />
&lt;@Miravlix&gt; I'm still here and haven't +ao exit'ed the bots. 
<br />
&lt;Pi&gt; (which we are all happy about) 
<br />
&lt;Pi&gt; but what i mean, is that would you be willing to run the ignhelp bots? 
<br />
&lt;@Miravlix&gt; And will keep them running until 1st January 2006. 
<br />
&lt;Pi&gt; lol 
<br />
&lt;@Miravlix&gt; Then my free acount dies. 
<br />
&lt;Pi&gt; jan 15th 2006*** 
<br />
&lt;Pi&gt;  
<br />
&lt;@Miravlix&gt; I need a margin of error, so I can erase ignhelp on the free account to give it to someone else 
<br />
&lt;Pi&gt; a margin of error? 
<br />
&lt;@Miravlix&gt; I forgot when I created the account.  
<br />
&lt;Pi&gt; oh, but you wouldn't have to relinquish control of the bots, just help the users taking over 
<br />
&lt;@Miravlix&gt; I just don't want to have the names end up on a banned/closed account. 
<br />
&lt;@Miravlix&gt; Like it happened with gridnet 
<br />
&lt;Pi&gt; but why would it be banned? 
<br />
&lt;@Miravlix&gt; I think the account with gridnet was banned 
<br />
&lt;@Miravlix&gt; But I don't know. 
<br />
&lt;@Miravlix&gt; I don't think my account will be banned, but it will auto cancel after one year due to payment 
<br />
&lt;Pi&gt; i understand... still having your knowledgable hand around would be nice... 
<br />
&lt;Pi&gt; (plus help with features and such would nice from time to time) 
<br />
&lt;@Miravlix&gt; If I actually knew something that would make more sense, but my knowglede of IGN is quite limited. 
<br />
&lt;Pi&gt; your help skills are still essential

That was just one of the mails I got this morning from 4 different people, who found all your slander a bit too distastefull, including a PM from someone here on HQ aswell. My internet's been down for a week, and just took the tour by to check if Koi was doing ok, since I decided last week I didn't want anything to do with anything public anymore. (exept due to this outcry from you now that I see as a neccesity to answer, hopefully the wrong people will leave me alone from now on so I can take my 30 year long vacation.)
<br />

<br />
This is the PM I sent you btw: (in which you claim you haven't gotten, why not ask Slicer, he owns HQ and I'm sure he can confirm what's in my sent-box or now, if i've sent it, and when i sent it (last week , the day i left:)

Bye bye, and nice knowing you, and thanks for all the hard work and help with IGN and the support. 
<br />
I don't know what will happen from here, but I'm turning my back on everything completely for my own good, it's not worth the trouble to me. 
<br />
As for IGN / IGN Res. you can do what you like with it, i'm 100% done with IGN. But anyone doing something with IGN from now, will have to do it without my assistance or serverscripts, I just don't have the will to do anything anymore with bots after Funcom closed one of those accounts I was borrowing, that was the last straw. 
<br />

<br />
Maybe we will meet in a next life or mmorpg sometime, and may you have all the good luck in all your future prospects.</td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody">

<br />
Does that seem like me denying you anything with IGN? no, but I will now, I'd rather you stay far away from IGN since you're not trustworthy the way I see it, you've hurt me with shitty comments behind my back, at a time I thought you were a considered friend.
<br />

<br />
I left IGN/HQ/AO not to "get even" at anyone, but because it stressed me out, stopped my RL (once again) and that's not good for anyone, so I needed to make that decision and turn my back to everything and move on. But you got some nerve sitting there pouting and whining about abandonment and me "hurting" the users. You're hurting the users the way you behave now. You've mistaken and been wrong about everything, and the reason I got banned in the first place now, was due to that I met Funcom ingame to show them a serious exploit, since they didn't listen to anyone or any other mails from neither anyone else nor myself. I knew it could perhaps lead to the account getting banned once again, but I did it because it was important that the error was fixed ASAP, why? Because of the AO-players security. But then again, I don't care about anyone according to yourself. Good luck with that reality-perception, really.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Now, I'm going to tell you again, like I did 10 times on IRC earlier today, after you tried in anger to ban me from #IGN because I banned you. (When other people in the channel mail me that your comments and presenece and arrogance due to your skill-level is unconfortable to them, and when they send me logs like that one from #IGN this week, then you you should have banned yourself for it, cause it's disgusting behavior, kicking on someone not even present, someone who's announced their leave for good, and then you still expect to "support" IGN? what kind of a joke is that? You don't support IGN, you support your "vision" of what should have, could have, would have been if you did something serious with IGN V3, In which you still havent, and no one's stopping you either.
<br />

<br />
You think I'm going to listen to your singlularaly needs just because you're managing the project when thousands of users have allready spoken they want the opposite on some idea? Think again.
<br />

<br />
You also tried to ban me from #IGN? Who started IGN? who started #IGN? who's been running support on #IGN for 3 years? you?
<br />

<br />
If you don't like IGN, nor me, then don't get yourself involved with it.
<br />

<br />
And as for blaming me for "stopping bot-development in AO at a time where FC finally comes with a serious upgrade". What kind of bullshit is that? When exactly did "IGN" become "bot-development" ? Again, there's LOADS of other bots and projects out there, IGN is one of them, If i stop doesnt mean bot-development stops, nor IGN's development either for that matter, quite the opposite. If IGN has had any impact, that means if it stops, someone will see a larger need for other bot-types and projects, that should only lead to MORE bot-development in general outside of IGN,
<br />
but I guess that would be so terrible too.
<br />

<br />
Oh, and PS: The central-code, has allready been released, twice, again why you keep lying on IRC when you sit there on your hight horse and talk shit behind my back?, Don't answer that, or anything else, cause I really don't want to be around to read it.
<br />

<br />
Now, for the last time, leave me alone, I've left this scene allready, show some slight decency and leave people alone when they say they've left the scenery, don't make me have to come back again, ever.

<br />

<br />
When a developer execute the cvs command to get IGNv3, it's linked to chat.php 1.0.0, irc.php 1.0.0 and items.php 1.0.0. He will then find a bug in items.php update the file and post it back to the cvs as 1.1.0.
<br />

<br />
The user will never have to worry about what IGNv3 means on the cvs. It's a manegement system for developers.
<br />

<br />
The next IGN will be IGN 301 it will link to chat.php 1.0.0, irc.php 1.0.0 and items.php 1.1.0 and the new cyber.php 1.0.0 someone created.
<br />

<br />
When the user needs support he will tell, he is using IGNv3 or IGN 301, then a developer can execute a cvs command to get either version from the cvs to check the code for bugs.
<br />

<br />
This is just one aspect of a cvs project. There is many more features and linked with sf.net's bug tracker, feature request and other features it becomes a very complicated (for devs) system, but it also make a project more manegable.<br />_________________<br />Kind Regards,
