<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by Slicer:
[B]A new version is out which includes a map editor.
To edit a map, it must first be defined in mapinfo.txt. If you find an area that's not in Mapinfo.txt, hop on IRC and tell me or Sparr; we'll guide you through getting the info we need.
The editor only allows inserting things at the "current player position". As it's kind of hard to get the Z value of the current mouse position, this is the only way.
A feature I'd like people to try out extensively is the "useless node finder", which tries to pinpoint a point in the map that's useless. 
A good example of a useless point is a point directly between two others (no difference in line angle) or a point that's on top of the next point in the same line. The function tries to balance between these two when choosing the useless point.
Some of the maps currently in use have way too many useless points, so this feature was needed... It WILL require some tweaking before we get it right though, so please post feedback.[/B][/QUOTE]

The mapinfo.txt was originally done by slicer for zones that he had maps for.  I went ahead and extrapolated all of the outdoor zone information.  I am not going to add dungeons to the list until someone provides me with the neccessary data.  You *CAN* add them yourself if you want to map.  Copy the entry for another dungeon, change the first number to the zone number for the dungeon and change the map name to something appropriate.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Sparr</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Oh, and Slicer...  I havent looked at the new code since you implemented mapping, so this might not be as useful as I would think, but here is an idea anyways.<P>On the useless node finder, allow users to set a 'tolerance' level.  0 would mean that it would only remove points that are exactly colinear, increasing the value would make the search more 'fuzzy' so that points really close together or almost colinear (theres a lot of 175-179 degree angles in most outdoor maps) would be removed</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Slicer</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">The weight of each node in a line is<P>(change of direction in radians + 0.1) * (sum of length of both edges)<P>Meaning that for LONG lines, an extra point with just a tiny change of direction will be kept, but for short lines the change will need to be greater to before it's considered removable.<BR>Note that the function just FINDS (as if selected) the most useless node, it doesn't actually delete it. So if you disagree with the algorithm, just disregard it  <IMG SRC="http://www.ethernalquest.com/ubb/wink.gif"><P>The only "tuning" that's necesarry is the +0.1 I do to the angle, as that's the balance between length and angle change... People are hereby encouraged to try to alter it and find a better value (or a better forumla) to "always" select what's right.<P>An alternative to my "find useless node" algorithm (which is pretty much a quick hack  <IMG SRC="http://www.ethernalquest.com/ubb/wink.gif"> ) is to use a proper geometry simplification algorithm in which the entire line is replaced by new points representing the same "shape" in a simpler way, but that's a bit off yet  <IMG SRC="http://www.ethernalquest.com/ubb/wink.gif"><P>I'm considering moving the entire map editing out to a separate program that would be usable by both SEQ and OE (and any other program that uses SEQ-type .maps) since map editing doesn't really "belong" in OE, but as the "link" part of it (linking to in-game player position) would need to be implemented in the other programs as well for it to be of any use.. Well.. Maybe in the future.<P>I haven't used SEQ for about a year now, how IS the map editing there compared to OE?<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Slicer</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">While I remember it, some people have had trouble using the map editor with QT 3.0.0, so please upgrade to 3.0.1 if you want to use the editor.<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Slicer</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Keyboard map navigation added:<BR>Up, Down, Left, Right (does what you expect)<BR>Page Up/Down (map range / zoom leve)<BR>Home - Resets position to player.<P>The "movement" is always relative to the player position, and hitting "Up" moves the mapcenter north, so if you have the "rotate map with player" option on it might be a bit confusing  <IMG SRC="http://www.ethernalquest.com/ubb/wink.gif"><P>Naturally, the map widget has to have the key focus for this to work.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Slicer</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I added a Douglas Peucker line simplification algorithm, which by default is enabled with a tolerance of 50.0<P>This will reduce the number of nodes in each line in the map when it's loaded so it's much faster to display, but should have almost unnoticable visual impact.<BR>Note that this algorithm is far superior to editing the map and removing "useless nodes", so the recommendation for now is to ALWAYS have it enabled (set the tolerance to 25.0 if you must) UNLESS you are editing maps. If you are editing maps, go turn it off and reload the map before you start editing, or you'll be editing a modified map  <IMG SRC="http://www.ethernalquest.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>I also updated the useless node finder a bit, but please just remove the nodes that are truly redundant... Please DO remove the nodes that are truly reduntant, though  <IMG SRC="http://www.ethernalquest.com/ubb/wink.gif"><BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">snowblind</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Maps made by the user should be saved in usermaps dir so a --update dont overwrite your maps.

I know it's not the same as mine because yours is recursive... the one in SINS is iterative).  Anyways, I think SEQ still doesn't do this, but most people are overzealous about putting too many points into their maps, and I discovered that SEQ was spending most of it's time drawing the lines that comprise the map, and most of the lines were unnecessary.<P>Anyways...
