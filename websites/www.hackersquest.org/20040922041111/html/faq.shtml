<FONT COLOR="00FF00" SIZE="3"><B>1.0 :: Basic Questions</FONT></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>1.1 :: What is a FAQ?</FONT></B><BR>
	FAQ stands for Frequently Asked Questions.<BR>
	The purpose of this FAQ is to help answer common questions.<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>1.1.1 :: Who made this FAQ?</FONT></B><BR>
	Draigon and TheeNos created this FAQ as well as some assistance from Ashran and Megaton.<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>1.1.2 :: Is everything listed here accurate and correct?</FONT></B><BR>
	Most likely.  We try to make everything listed here as correct, but please don't take it as fact or evidence.<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>1.2 :: What is the point of HackersQuest?</FONT></B><BR>
	HackersQuest was started to develop programs for EverQuest and Ultima Online.  These programs can be seen as learning tools, hacking programs, and what-not.  However the focus has moved towards EverQuest only.<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>1.2.1 :: What is EverQuest?</FONT></B><BR>
	EverQuest is a multiplayer roleplaying game developed by Verant Interactive.  The official website for EverQuest can be located at: http://www.everquest.com/<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>1.3 :: Are you guys just making a virus and tricking people into downloading it?</FONT></B><BR>
	We are not making virii, trojans, or anything of that nature.  If any of our programs has a virus on it we were not aware of it.  You should always run anti-virus software on downloads regardless of what we say.  It is highly recommended that you download our files from this website and not any others.  People have been known to hide a trojan in programs such as the ones you find on this website.<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>1.3.1 :: If you're not making a virus, how can you call yourself a hacker?</FONT></B><BR>
	Stop watching movies.  It's eating your brain.  Hackers aren't always destructive.  There are malicious hackers that develop programs with the intent to destroy something, but that does not apply to all hackers.  HackersQuest is finding out how EverQuest works and possibly duplicating some aspects of the live servers.  Not haxoring the main frame and watching spinning pi symbols.<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>1.4 :: Can I join?</FONT></B><BR>
	Possibly.  Depends on what you have to offer.  If you think you can help a great deal speak with Ashran [ashran@mcb.at].<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>1.4.1 :: I don't know how to program, but I really want to help. What can I do?</FONT></B><BR>
	Support HackersQuest.  Our projects are for your usage.  If you have any suggestions on any of our projects feel free to tell us.  You can post a message on the forum or talk to us in IRC. There might also be times when we ask for help on the news page.<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>1.4.2 :: Are there other ways of contacting you?</FONT></B><BR>
	You can try our IRC [Internet Relay Chat] channel at:<BR>
	Server:  irc.giblets.com<BR>
	Port: 6667<BR>
	Channel: #showEQ<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>1.5 :: What is IRC?</FONT></B><BR>
	IRC stands for Internet Relay Chat.  It allows you to communicate with others on the internet through chat channels.  If you are running windows, I suggest getting mIRC [www.mirc.com].  If you are running linux, I suggest getting BitchX [www.bitchx.org]<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>1.5.1 :: How the hell do I run this thing?</FONT></B><BR>
	Well I could type up a very long tutorial or you could just read the FAQ's located on the client site [where you downloaded the IRC client].  I'm sure you'll find all your answers there.<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>1.6 :: What is a packet sniffer?</FONT></B><BR>
	While you are on a network [such as the internet] you are transmitting data through other computers.  These computers you pass information through can view the data you are sending.  Packet sniffing allows you to capture the data and view it.<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>1.6.1 :: What have you used a packet sniffer for?</FONT></B><BR>
	Using a packet sniffer we have been able to see what information is sent to and from the EverQuest servers.  Analyzing this data we have been able to display information previously hidden to the EverQuest player.<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>1.6.2 :: Can anyone detect that you are packet sniffing?</FONT></B><BR>
	In order for a computer to know where to send the data it has to read the data packet.  There is no way to tell that you are reading the data packet so that you can analyze the data or if you're simply passing it along.  This is assuming you are running through a computer that has the packet sniffer and not running the packet sniffer on the same computer as EverQuest.<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>1.6.3 :: Is packet sniffing illegal?</FONT></B><BR>
	Packet sniffing is not illegal.  It's a network tool.  However when you signed the agreement for EverQuest you agreed to not use 3rd party programs on it.  Packet sniffing the EverQuest data packets is considered using a 3rd party program.<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>1.6.4 :: So basically as long as they don't know we're doing it, it's ok?</FONT></B><BR>
	That's up to you to decide.  We could start a legal debate over it which could last forever.<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>1.7 :: What are all these files in my EverQuest directory?</FONT></B><BR>
	The files in your EverQuest directory are for graphics, sound, and preferences.  There is no player information saved on your computer.  This is to protect against people hacking the player data files and giving themselves anything they want.<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>1.7.1 :: So if I wanted to hack my character, I couldn't?</FONT></B><BR>
	By editing the files on your computer, no.  If you were to hack the EverQuest servers you could edit your character, but that is obviously illegal and you would obviously get in trouble for it.<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>1.7.2 :: What are these .xmi files?</FONT></B><BR>
	The xmi files are xmidi files.  These are the music files for EverQuest.  You can download a xmi to midi converter from the internet if you want to listen to EverQuest music without being in EverQuest.<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>1.7.3 :: What are these .s3d and .pak files?</FONT></B><BR>
	These are the archive files for EverQuest.  These files contain all the bitmaps, models, and zones.  You can use the EQInside program to view these files.<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>1.7.3.1 :: What is the difference between the different .s3d files?</FONT></B><BR>
	Depends on the file.  If it is zone.s3d then this loads all the textures and zone files needed for that zone.  If it is zone_chr.s3d then this loads all the textures and models for that zone.  If the model is not listed in the _chr file that it is not possible for that model to ever be in that zone.  If it is zone_obj.s3d then this loads all the textures and models for the objects in that zone.  Such as tables, boxes, doors, and the like.<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>1.7.4 :: What are these .pfs files?</FONT></B><BR>
	These are the sound archives for EverQuest.  These files contain all the sound waves.  You can use the EQInside program to open these files.<P>

<FONT COLOR="00FF00" SIZE="3"><B>2.0 :: Tutorial Hacking</FONT></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>2.1 :: What is Tutorial Hacking?</FONT></B><BR>
	Tutorial hacking is manipulating the tutorial.exe to do things it was not intended for.  There are surely more ways than one to hack the tutorial.exe, but there isn't much of a point to do so.  The tutorial.exe program is a "gimped" version of the other EverQuest programs.  In other words it's missing or disabled alot of the functions the normal EverQuest programs have.  Instead of spending alot of time hacking the tutorial.exe it makes more sense to hack the other programs.  However, the tutorial does serve as a handy zone viewer.<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>2.1.1 :: Is this really hacking?</FONT></B><BR>
	Sort of.  What I'm going to describe here is hex editing the tutorial program.  Most people don't consider this hacking because it's easy, but I don't really care.  I consider it a hack wether it's easy or not.  Just remember this won't make you a hacker *grins*<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>2.1.2 :: This is a lame trick. Why is this in the FAQ?</FONT></B><BR>
	Because it's a frequently asked question.  Instead of replying every time I would rather point people here.  [Duh!  That's what this FAQ is for.]<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>2.2 :: What do I need to hack the tutorial?</FONT></B><BR>
	You will need a hex editor.  There are tons of them out there.  You can do a search for them or just download one of the more famous hex editors such as AXE [www.kahei.com/axe/axe.htm].<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>2.3 :: Ok, how do I hack the tutorial with my hex editor?</FONT></B><BR>
	Open tutorial.exe with your hex editor and look towards the bottom.  If you really want to understand why this works you could read through some of it and find out why, but if you don't really care just look for the line that says "Couldn't connect to network, creating solo player..."  Shortly after that you should see "Soandso tutorial"  The word Soandso is the name of your character while playing the tutorial.  You can edit that to make it anything you want.  However if you want to load up a zone other than the tutorial, simply type the name of the zone you want to load.  For example, say you want to load Grobb.  Because the zone file for Grobb is "grobb.s3d" you replace the word "tutorial" with "grobb".  You may have noticed this leaves you with "Soandso grobbial"  The logical solution to this problem would be to hit the spacebar twice, BUT there is no file called "grobb  .s3d"!!  So this will not work.  Look over under the section with all the numbers labeled "Bytes"  This shows you the hex digits for the letters.  A spacebar has a value of "20"  You do not want "20", you want "00" which is null.  In most hex editors if you select a letter under the ANSII section it will highlight the number under the Bytes section.  So highlight the part that says "grobbial"  Go over to the bytes that represent "ial" and type zeros until it reads "Soandso grobb"  That's it.  Save the file and try to run tutorial.exe.  If you did it right it will load the zone you wanted.<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>2.3.1 :: I did everything you said and it still doesn't work.  Why?</FONT></B><BR>
	Well did you overwrite or insert?  If you inserted text then you messed it up.  The program does a check on itself to make sure it hasn't been tampered and if you insert text obviously it's been tampered with.  Do the same steps except overwrite whats there and don't insert.<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>2.3.2 :: Do the same rules for the zone name apply to the character name?</FONT></B><BR>
	Yes.  You must have a null [represented by 00 under the bytes section] between the character name and the zone name.  If you type over the null that was originally there then just type in a new one.<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>2.3.3 :: I did everything you said and this junk still doesn't work!</FONT></B><BR>
	Keep at it.  You'll get it.  Be sure to save a backup so that if you really mess up you can just start over again.<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>2.3.3.1 :: Is there an easier way to do this?</FONT></B><BR>
	Yes, actually.  After the tutorial hack was discussed on message boards it gained a little popularity to some programmers with time on their hands.  The only program I have seen that seems to check out virus-wise can be found at:<BR>
	http://home.tampabay.rr.com/estembler/tristram/eze.htm<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>2.4 :: Why can't I run or use any of the commands?</FONT></B><BR>
	It's a tutorial.  Alot was disabled.  There's really no way around that with simple hex editing.<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>2.5 :: Why is everything so dark and why are some zones in a little box?</FONT></B><BR>
	Some zones will start you in a little box because that is where the 0,0,0 [x,y,z] coordinate is placed.  It was placed there as a reference for Guides that teleport into the zone.  The zones are dark because you are human.  Everything is as if you are running in the tutorial except for the zone you loaded.<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>2.6 :: Where is everything?  There are no doors, boxes, npcs.</FONT></B><BR>
	It doesn't load the zone object files.  So you are left with the tutorial NPC's and objects.<P>

<FONT COLOR="00FF00" SIZE="3"><B>3.0 :: EQInside</FONT></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>3.1 :: What is EQInside?</FONT></B><BR>
	EQInside reads the EverQuest archive files and allows you to extract data from them.<BR>
	It also reads the spell.dat file to display information about every spell in EverQuest.<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>3.2 :: What files does EQInside open?</FONT></B><BR>
	The .s3d, .pak, and .pfs files.<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>3.3 :: What data can be extracted with EQInside?</FONT></B><BR>
	Artwork, sound, models, and zone files.  Anything placed within the archive files can be extracted.<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>3.4 :: Oh, cool. So I can make changes, save them, and view them in EverQuest?</FONT></B><BR>
	No.  Unfortunately that isn't possible with the way the EverQuest servers check to make sure you have the correct files.  There are also CRC checks which will cause the program to close before you ever see the changes you've made.<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>3.4.1 :: So what is the point?</FONT></B><BR>
	If you want to see the artwork for EverQuest and how they put the game together, EQInside is a good tool.  Of course, it also makes a good tool for building an emulator.<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>3.5 :: I used EQInside to look up a spell, but all the information there was wrong. Why?</FONT></B><BR>
	This is because it reads the spell.dat file.  Occaisionally Verant sends fake spell data to throw us off.  It's mostly accurate, however.<P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME="4">
<FONT COLOR="00FF00" SIZE="3"><B>4.0 :: EQSpells</FONT></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>4.1 :: What is EQSpells?</FONT></B><BR>
	EQSpells reads the spell.dat file and displays the information for every spell in EverQuest.<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>4.2 :: I used EQSpells to look up a spell, but all the information there was wrong. Why?</FONT></B><BR>
	This is because it reads the spell.dat file in your EverQuest directory.  Verant sometimes sends fake spell data<P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT COLOR="00FF00" SIZE="3"><B>5.0 :: ShowEQ</FONT></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>5.1 :: What is ShowEQ?</FONT></B><BR>
	ShowEQ is a tool that shows you information hidden to the player while you are playing EverQuest.<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>5.2 :: Why is the FAQ for ShowEQ so damn small?</FONT></B><BR>
	Because I didn't spend much time on it.  If you have questions on ShowEQ send them to Draigon [draigon@purplenet.net] and I will include them in the FAQ [with the answer].<P>

<A NAME="6">
<FONT COLOR="00FF00" SIZE="3"><B>6.0 :: Emulator</FONT></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>6.1 :: What is an emulator?</FONT></B><BR>
	EverQuest is run by Verant.  When you connect to EverQuest normally you are connecting to a Verant server.  The emulator is connecting to a server not owned or operated by Verant.  It is owned and operated by players.  Many aspects of EverQuest are controlled server-side.  This means the emulated environment can be completely different from the live environment.<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>6.2 :: When will the emulator be released?</FONT></B><BR>
	We don't really want to dedicate to a time.  It should be soon.<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>6.2.1 :: No really.  Tell me, damnit.</FONT></B><BR>
	Possibly towards the end of March or mid-April a working copy will be released.<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>6.2.2 :: Are you going to hold to that date or be like all those other companies?</FONT></B><BR>
	We're not a company.  We didn't want to dedicate to a time.  If it doesn't come out when we hope it will, don't blame us.<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>6.3 :: Will there be a testing phase for the emulator?</FONT></B><BR>
	Possibly, but it will most likely be held between a small group of people.<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>6.3.1 :: Can I test the emulator also?</FONT></B><BR>
	If we are in need of testers for the emulator we will most likely go to the IRC channel and grab those who are available.<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>6.4 :: Will the source code be released?</FONT></B><BR>
	It is possible.  There are two versions of the emulator being worked on.  Megaton is working under the Linux environment and Ashran is working under the Windows environment.  Either could choose to release source code.  It is a possibility.  Not a promise.<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>6.4.1 :: You idiot. This should be an open source project. Don't you understand if you open source it the emulator will be better?</FONT></B><BR>
	This is a project of HackersQuest.  We don't owe you anything just as you don't owe us anything.  It has been worked on by groups of people in and outside of HackersQuest, but the choice to open source it or not ultimately lies in the hands of those at HackersQuest.  We fully understand the advantages and disadvantages to open source and will weigh those factors in when the choice is made.<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>6.4.2 :: Why would you decide to keep the source to yourself?</FONT></B><BR>
	For a number of reasons.  Mostly dealing with the fact that people would alter the code alot and not stay true to the original creators format.  There are also concerns of people claiming ownership of the emulator and publishing their own closed-source versions or releasing a virus/trojan using the compiled emulator code.  There are other reasons and the reasons presented here may seem trivial or petty, but they are factors in the decision.<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>6.5 :: Will I have to know how to program to use the emulator?</FONT></B><BR>
	No.  Running an emulated server might require some computer knowledge, however.  I don't want to go into great detail about this yet.<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>6.6 :: Will we be able to create our own items, monsters, npcs, and/or zones?</FONT></B><BR>
	It is possible to create all of those things.  However there are limitations which I do not want to go into detail about yet.<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>6.6.1 :: Will we have tools to create them?</FONT></B><BR>
	That would be the ideal way of doing it and most likely there will be tools for doing such tasks.  More details will be released later.<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>6.6.2 :: What about artwork and sounds?</FONT></B><BR>
	It's possible, but just as said above there are details I can't get into yet.<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>6.7 :: Will we be able to set our own xp table?</FONT></B><BR>
	You pretty much have to.  That is set server-side.  Although the graphical xp bar is done client side.  Meaning if your xp table for the server is set differently than it should be, the graphical xp bar won't be very helpful since it will be greatly inaccurate.<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>6.8 :: Can we make it so that the Dragons and Gods are weak so we can actually kill them??</FONT></B><BR>
	With the information we've gathered from ShowEQ we are able to recreate the Dragons and Gods, but we can set their difficulty to be just about anything.  The question is... why would you want to do that?<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>6.9 :: Will boats work in the emulator?</FONT></B><BR>
	Boats have not been tested in the emulator yet.<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>6.10 :: I have a great server you guys can host the server on.  Want to?</FONT></B><BR>
	Tell us about it.  Send an e-mail to Ashran.<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>6.11 :: Aren't you guys afraid of Verant shutting you down?</FONT></B><BR>
	No.<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>6.11.1 :: No, seriously.  Won't you guys get shut down for what you're doing?</FONT></B><BR>
	Doubtful.  I'm sure Verant would love it if we disappeared.  Fact is they aren't going to lose much if we stick around or if we go away.  Verant offers a service only Verant can offer.  It is possible to come close to the way Verant operates their servers, but some aspects will simply never be the same.  Such as in-game support, customer service, frequent bug fixes, expansions, etc.<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>6.12 :: Will this emulator work for Ruins of Kunark?</FONT></B><BR>
	Yes.<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>6.13 :: Wouldn't it be easier to edit other open-source 3D engines to replicate EverQuest?</FONT></B><BR>
	You mean like the Quake engines?  Sure you could make it look like EverQuest, but making it operate like EverQuest would be very hard.  If you're going to do that it would be easier to just start from scratch and make our own video game.<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>6.14 :: How do we know this emulator isn't just a fake?</FONT></B><BR>
	First of all, why the hell would we make a website if the emulator was fake?  I fail to see the logic in that.  Secondly, you can download the other programs on HackersQuest and figure out if the possibility isn't there.  Thirdly, check the screenshots section.<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>6.14.1 :: Big whoop.  I can fake screenshots to.  What makes you different?</FONT></B><BR>
	Ours is interactive.<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>6.14.2 :: How do we know you're not just lieing?</FONT></B><BR>
	Time will tell.  If you think we're lieing then stop obsessing over it.  Play EverQuest and forget all about us.<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>6.15 :: I want to help out with the emulator.  Who do I contact?</FONT></B><BR>
	Please contact both Ashran and Megaton.<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>6.16 :: Does this break the agreement that I signed with Verant?</FONT></B><BR>
	No.  The emulator was built from reverse engineering which is 100% legal.  However Verant reserves the right to cancel your EverQuest account on a whim therefore if they discover you are using an emulator they might feel it necessary to delete your account.<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>6.17 :: Will the emulator be free?</FONT></B><BR>
	Yes and no.  You are going to need to purchase EverQuest so that you have the files for the emulator to use, but you will never have to purchase the emulator software nor access to the emulated servers.<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>6.18 :: Who is creating this?</FONT></B><BR>
	Ashran is developing an emulator for windows.  Megaton is developing an emulator for linux.<BR>
	However neither developer would be nearly as far as they are without the help of outside visitors to HackersQuest and contributors to ShowEQ development.<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>6.19 :: How many people will be able to connect to a server?</FONT></B><BR>
	This is greatly dependant on the server.  It's hard to guess at so we will simply have to wait and see.<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>6.19.1 :: Can you guess?  10? 100? 1000? 2000?</FONT></B><BR>
	Well, it's hard to tell, but I would guess around 500?  On a good day? :)<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>6.20 :: Will I be able to create my own servers?</FONT></B><BR>
	Yes with the server software.  When the emulator is first released, however, we will have one server setup.<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>6.20.1 :: Will I be able to host all zones on a single machine?</FONT></B><BR>
	No.  You would need some a very nice computer system to be able to host all zones at the same time.<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>6.20.1.1 :: Well since I can't host them all.  Can I only host the ones I'm using at the time?</FONT></B><BR>
	This is a possibility that has yet to be explored fully.<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>6.20.2 :: Will I be able to remotely administrate? [GM?]</FONT></B><BR>
	There will be GMs, but I do not know if you will be one.  At least not on the server that HackersQuest sets up.  It's possible.  If you are talking about GM commands, I think everyone will get their fair share of abilities.<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>6.21 :: Will I have to run through a verification server such as the chat server?</FONT></B><BR>
	There will be an account server setup to log you into the system, but it won't validate wether you have a EverQuest account or not.<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>6.21.1 :: Ah ha!  So you are going to record my EverQuest login information there so you can hack my real EverQuest account!</FONT></B><BR>
	Don't use your real username and password freak!  Make one up.<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>6.22 :: What are you using as a database?</FONT></B><BR>
	Currently using MySql.<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>6.22.1 :: What Operating System is MySql based for?</FONT></B><BR>
	Win32 development.<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>6.23 :: Can we declare what races/classes are evil and good?</FONT></B><BR>
	That's all handled through factions.  So yes.<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>6.23.1 :: Factions are handled server-side?</FONT></B><BR>
	Yes.<P>
	<FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><B>6.24 :: Can the starting point in zones be set by the server?</FONT></B><BR>
	Absolutely.<P>
