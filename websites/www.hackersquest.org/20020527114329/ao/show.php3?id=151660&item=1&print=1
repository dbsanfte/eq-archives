<tr><th>Desc</th><td colspan="2">How To Make Jewellery<br /><br />Part 1: Filigree Rings<br /><br />Filigree rings are created by weaving strands of precious metal (silver, gold or platinum) around a Generic Ring Template. Successfully weaving these thin strands of metal requires not only a knowledge of Mechanical Engineering but also a high Agility.<br /><br />To create the filigree wire that is needed for this process, a Wire Drawing Machine is used on some liquid metal. This liquid metal is produced by using a Personal Furnace on a small ingot of silver, gold or platinum.<br /><br />Part 2: Gems and Other Precious Stones<br /><br />Using a Jensen Gem Cutter, it is possible to cut and polish certain gems and other precious stones. Doing this will greatly increase their value. Using a gem cutter requires Mechanical Engineering skill and a high Agility.<br /><br />The gems that can be cut and polished are also able to be set into filigree rings. Both cut and uncut gems can be set in this way. Setting a gem into a filigree ring will further increase the value of that ring.<br /></td></tr>
