<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">"Here's the quote from the article Tux:

Analysts say that's in line with the industry standard, *****and competitor Nintendo reported a comparable rate for its new GameCube.*****

Dumb fuck..."

Yeah Nintendo is saying that they have about a 1% defect rate. But remember, the person reporting that it is just 1% in the first place is Microsoft's marketing and sales director.

(What's with the insults? How about some maturity...)

"I'm not talking about now fool. I'm talking about 90% of new games that will be coming out. For example, two very anticpated games for PC that are coming out are Elder Scrolls 3 and Halo. Both of which are now on or will be coming out on X-Box."

*sigh* Again with the insults, some people never grow up...

It is beyond me how you can call games "the best" when they haven't even come out yet. Wait until all these games come out and see how the actual games match up, not by what some trailer is showing you.

"Also, I'm sorry if you are too daft to understand I meant upcoming games, not all games ever made. Again looking at release lists it seems most console developers are making X-Box AND PS2 versions of most of their games. Meaning that while there might be a few exclusives, most console games and many PC games could be heading to the X-Box, making it somewhat of a hybrid machine, which is perfect for me. Maybe not for you, but then again I don't give a fuck about fools like you."

Again, how can you judge a game in relation to others that are already out when the game your refering too is not even released yet?

"PS2 is a great system and I'm sure Gamecube is just fine, so if you like those, wonderful, but I don't see why you gotta be talking all the shit about X-Box unless you're having second thoughts about the system that you bought and need to assure yourself you made the right choice by bashing it."

I don't have a gamecube and the PS2 I got as a gift, there isn't really anything to have "second thoughts" about in this situtation considering it was free for me. Also you need to learn the difference between bashing and a debate. As I said before, if someone is going to start a thread like this they sures as hell better expect to hear a lot of differing opinions.

"If I want to play PS1 games I'll play them on my PS1. I dont need to spend $300 so I can use a black controller. IMO backward-compatibility is completly useless because most PS2 buyers will have PS1 anyway. I'd rather be able to rip my own soundtracks and save them on the hard-drive."

Heh, that wasen't exactly the point. The point was that it is just an extra little bonus for the PS2. Great graphics, awesome games for it, /and/ you can play all of your old PS1 games, and there are a lot of really cool ones. Anyways, that is like me saying, if I want something to rip soundtracks from and save to a hard drive I'll get a bare-bones system for 100 bucks and through in a cd-burner. Your point was obviously that is is just an extra bonus, as was mine   <IMG SRC="http://www.ethernalquest.com/ubb/wink.gif">

"'If you’re going to start a thread like this you can't possibly expect people to not post their opinions as well'

If i was an admin or a mod i could"

Well your not.

Pirub9, I don't think anyone is trying to argue that the xbox doesn't have awesome specs. But the fact is there are kick ass PC games that you could play with really nice graphics on a barebones system. But your never going to get the kind of specs xbox has for that price anywhere but an xbox itself. It is just like what the big oil companies did back in the day to keep out competition. They would drive down the price so low that no other "smaller" companies could compete and since they were huge already they could just absorb the cost and jack the prices when the competition is gone.

Same thing with the xbox. Microsoft is able to make a game system so cheap (reletive to its specs) that no other company could compete if they tried the same. But they are a huge company so they are able to absorb the debt (Microsoft wont even /break even/ on xbox until the year 2004). The question is, what are they going to do once they work their way into the market? (Jack the prices of their next system quite a bit, only make minor updated to the xbox2 but keep the expensive price, use it to force people into .NET services, etc...) Really it is their tool for pushing their way into a very copetitive market. Microsoft is not used to competition, so this is pretty new ground for them. But with enough dirty tatics I'm sure they'll do just fine. But that doesn't mean they're system is "better" on all levels. It simply means it has good specs and a relitivly good price, period. How fun the games are, what kind of support they offer, etc... are whole other levels.

"I’m also pretty sure that Xbox is far superior to PS2 and GameCube in terms of power"

Please refer to my comments above.
