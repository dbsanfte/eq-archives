<h1>NoD Application Process</h1>
<p>Nexus Of Dreams is a family oriented guild. The type of raid and frequency depends on availability of members and a raid leader. We are not a mandatory raiding guild. If you expect to raid AoW next week, then Nexus Of Dreams is not for you.</p>
<hr>
<p>Post your application in the new recruits area of website. Please include the following information.
<ul><li>Character's full name
<li>Character's class, race & level
<li>Your current & all previous guilds</ul>
<p>Please describe your interest in Nexus Of Dreams. Tell us a little about character's experiences & game knowledge.</p>
<p>Please describe yourself & certainly only tell us things you are comfortable telling.</p>
<p>Please carefully read this section & include all above information.</p>

<h1>Minimum Requirements For Consideration</h1>
<ul><li>Although we do not have a minimum age requirement. We do require a certain maturity level of our members. You know yourself better than anyone. We ask that you consider your tolerance level & patience. If you have a temper problem, lack of patience, inability to follow order & accept leadership unfortunately Nexus of Dreams will not suit you.
<li>The minimum level for entry is 30th. This is important for a number of reasons. Most importantly it reflects your commitment. It also helps to ensure you have some game knowledge & that you can be self sufficient.
<li>Your relationship history with other guilds or members of Antonius Bayle must be mentioned. If you have a history of dishonourable action(s) we will not consider you for entry. Every applicant will be researched to some degree. If you have had an unfortunate experience that was not your fault, please explain this in your application.</ul>

<h1>To Enter Nexus Of Dreams.</h1>
<p>All members are requested to direct new people to our guild website. From this the prospective candidate can:</p>
<ul><li>Receive a guild invite on a trial basis, assuming that the main criteria have been met. Expect a tell in game, or contact an officer for details. <li>This does not have to be the Recruitment Officer, but the Recruitment Officer will sanction the initial request.
<li>Expect their application to be reviewed weekly. Upon noting your request the Recruitment Officer will post a "request for a vote" in the members section of our website.</ul>

<p>Each applicant during this time should:</p>
<ul><li>Review our website for any upcoming public events.
<li>Speak to our members online to inquire about private NoD events.
<li>Attend as many events as possible.
<li>Group with our members whenever possible.
<li>As a recruit, your objective is to seek out and become friends with our family. Take every opportunity to talk to us. We are all very nice people and really do want to hear from you!
<li>The vote will stay open for a period of one week. The Recruitment Officer will notify the Guild of the pending vote by utilizing the GUILD MOTD. Active members are required to vote. { NoD OFFICERS will not place a vote or comment in the members section. } The vote will be as follows.
<blockquote>A.) YES - I agree with this application.<br>
B.) NO - I do not agree with this application because....</blockquote>
<li>Depending on the number & type of votes a decision will be made by the Recruitment Officer.
<blockquote>A.) He will forward your application to the other officers.<br>
B.) He will request you continue to get to know our members better. { Minimum two week wait for another vote. }<br>
C.) He will decline your application without forwarding it.</blockquote>
<li>If forwarded, the officers of Nexus of Dreams will be presented with a summation of the "vote results" via the officers section. They will make the final determination on your application via their channel.
<li>The Recruitment Officer will remove your application & the members voting information, as applicable. If someone has said 'no' and it is overridden, this should ensure that people do not start out on the wrong footing!
<li>You will be notified of the outcome by the Recruitment Officer or Guild Leader, regardless of the result. This will be via a tell, and never on the open forum. Expect a 'Gratz' post in the members section if you are successful though!</ul>

<h1>Exceptions</h1>
<ul><li>If you are immediate family to a current member of NoD and would like to join. Please have the member speak to an officer "in game" for an invite.
<li>Alternate characters may be invited by any officer. These may be of any level, but must always be on /role if below level 30.
<li>The inviting officer is required to forward a written update to the other officers.</ul>
<p>When made a full time member, each new member has the following tasks to complete within 30 days </p>
<ol><li>Register on guildmagic (<a href="http://www.guildmagic.com">www.guildmagic.com</a>) : to do this you need your own account and must submit their character(s) to the guild. Please speak to guild members or officers if stuck!
<li>Register on the guild website (<a href="http://www.nexusofdreams.co.uk">www.nexusofdreams.co.uk</a>): you need an account on this site and must post in the members request access forum. You should also read this forum regularly, and hopefully post your thoughts too. The webmaster does not put his hard work into maintaining this page for the good of his health!
<li>Each new member must continue to make themselves known to the members of the guild: to do this, one needs to : 
<ol><li>Talk openly in guild chat: if you stay silent then no one knows who you are and the guild cannot get to know a name they have never seen. 
<li>Try grouping as often as possible with others your level. This gives you and them playing experience with each other so we all get to know each other.</ol></ol>

<h1>The Order of NoD. (or what we expect!)</h1>
<p>After a month or so, you will be expected to understand, and act upon the following:</p>
<ol><li>Know and understand the rules and regulations of the guild : the charter and vision statement, guild rules, raid and loot rules etc. Knowledge of this can be demonstrated by using it to answer questions on these subjects asked by others in guild chat or groups. 
<li>Help others in the guild: your guildies are your best asset in the game, and are here to help when possible. At some point you will need help and others are more likely to go out of their way to help you if they see you are going out of your way to help them. ie. do unto others as you would have them do unto you. 
<li>Post often on the website: the website is your window to what is happening in the guild and on the game. Raids? Quests? Need Help? Whatever is going on the answer is probably on the website. Or should be. And always note the MOTD when you login. At anytime you can /guildmotd to get it </ol>

<h1>Want to move on in the guild?</h1>
<p>So you're a great player, know your stuff, and you are enjoying the guild. Please:</p>
<ol><li>Continue their pursuit of all the above. 
<li>Strive to help others outside the guild: You never truly know who is around at any given time. When you stop to heal the injured , SOW the slow, Clarity the weak of mind, help a fellow traveler get to a given destination, offer good information in shout or OOC, or whatever the case may be, you are helping others. If you are doing these things you bring respect to your name and also the guild.
<li>If you are porting, SOWing, runing etc for cash, not all of the above necessarily applies. But if not actively earning cash, the above should apply.</ol>
<p>The rules above should be taken in their true spirit, and not necessarily to the letter.</p>

<h1>Officer requirements...</h1>
<p>You have achieved a reputation that all people in the world of Norrath aspire to. </p>

<p>You are:</p>
<ol><li>The problem solvers : you handle the problems and disputes between members and between the members and nonguilded people. You will attempt to gather all the information possible in all situations. You have the other officers to assist you and the Guild Leader, and do not feel obliged to make a descision on which you are unsure of.
<li>Whatever the situation the GL will be notified via email, post, or direct tell in game. 
<li>Officers will have a meeting if an accusation proves to be a serious offence that may require removal from the guild. Please ensure you forward your concerns to them.
<li>The guild invites are your task: You always look for potential candidates to NoD. Note the current recruiting rules be sure that each new member has the guildmagic and website addresses. Everyone you recommend for entrance is a reflection on you, so don't invite willy-nilly. There is no reward for inviting the most people!
</ol>
