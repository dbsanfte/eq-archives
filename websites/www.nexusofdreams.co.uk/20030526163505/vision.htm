										<h1>NoD Vision</h1>
										<p>The Nexus Of Dreams was founded in February, 2002 for the sole purpose of bringing Everquest gamers together in fraternity and for sharing pleasure in the game.</p>
										<p>This guild was founded by a close-knit group of friends who spent a lot of time enjoying each other's company in EQ. We are looking to keep that close relationship and to make new friends that have common likes and interests in Norrath.</p>
										<p>The founding members believed that a Guild Policy was not necessary at the time because they had common goals and beliefs which constituted a mutually beneficial gaming experience. Due to our increase in numbers, the time has come to express those beliefs in a Guild Policy, which will be enforced by the officers of the Guild.</p>
										<p>NoD is looking for friendly faces that believe in taking care of their own. We are looking for people with a high level of maturity and responsibility that can play their class skillfully while having fun. FUN is the big word here!</p>
