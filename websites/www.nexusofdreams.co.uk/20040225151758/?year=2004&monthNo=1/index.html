						<h1>Dear members, friend and guests, welcome to the Nexus of Dreams website.....</h1>
						<p><strong><u>History</u></strong></p>
						<p>Nexus of Dreams was formed in Feb 2002 by a group of friends. Since then the 
							small outfit of around 20 members has grown to house over 280 members and 
							become one of the biggest guilds on Antonius Bayle. Nexus of Dreams has had 
							4 GL's, most notably Hermanak, who led NoD for over a year in its early 
							stages and the present one, Loronith. Nexus of Dreams has kept a cor number 
							of its original members as well as a core group of friends that have risen up 
							through the NoD feeder guild, Dreamers of Nexus when it was first formed in 
							2003.</p>
							<p><strong><u>Guild Leader Statement: - What do we stand for?</u></strong></p>
							
						<p>	As guild leader, I want our motto 'Stand together, bound by friendship' to be 
echoed throughout the guild. Nexus of Dreams to me is founded on loyalty and 
friendship above all else. The fact we have groups of RL friends in the 
guild, as well as friends made through the net really do make for a great 
environment.<br><br>Nexus of Dreams is a multi-national guild (mainly European, but plenty of 
Americans and Canadians) and as a result we have alot going on around the 
clock, to benefit one and all. Nexus of Dreams in my opinion is aiming at 
the 'I like to raid some, but want to enjoy the other factors of the game as 
well' market. </p></td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="7">
<p>We are not an uber raid-a-day guild, we raid 2-3 times a week 
and attendance is optional (although preferred), and the rest of the time is 
left so you can group, adventure, tradeskill, quest or whatever you like.
I have to admit as GL, my shortfall is my reaction to those guildees who 
move on from NoD. I do get overly upset when people leave as i see the 
efforts put in by many of the members getting wasted. I do not hate those 
that leave, I just get angry cos I care for NoD as a whole and want us to 
progress together. People leaving just do not help for this to come true. 
Loyalty as i said before and patience is a virtue</p>

<p><strong><u>Raiding</u></strong></p>
<p>In 2 year NoD has gone from Runnyeye to BoT Towers and the like. The 
ambition, will, drive and skills are there. Over the past 2 years NoD has 
come to learn many things like, 'Anyone know a necro who can summon our 
corpses' hehe!!<br><br>
