<h1>NoD Charter</h1>
<ol>
<li>The overriding credo for NoD shall be respect. Both for your fellow Guild members and for other players on Antonius Bayle. Flames, abusive behaviour and vulgar language will not be tolerated in guildchat, nor in public chat zones. If you have a problem with a Guild member, and cannot resolve it in /tells, you are encouraged to involve an officer who will do their best to mediate the problem. If you feel a Guild member has dishonoured the NoD Guildtag, or if a non-NoD player complains about one of our members, an officer should also become involved to determine the facts of the problem and decide on the most fair outcome, in the best interest of the Guild. Reports of ninjalooting, harassment or killstealing will not be tolerated under any circumstances.
<li>Leaving the Guild because of the actions of another Guild member, or due to an argument with another Guild member is considered an inappropriate action. Disagreements can be dealt with in many other ways - leaving the Guild is a drastic move which impacts the morale of the remaining members. At the discretion of the officers, a member who leaves under these circumstances will be allowed back into the Guild. No one will be allowed to do this twice.
<li>At the discretion of the officers, primary characters who leave Nexus Of Dreams to join another guild may be asked to remove all of their other characters immediately. If your primary character is in another guild, none of your characters, whether members of NoD or not, will be merited loot in a raid.
<li>As a guild, our Velious armor faction will be CoV faction, and our guild play situations will reflect on this. This may change, and you will be required to do so accordingly. However, the faction standing is unlikely to change in the near future.
<li>Any applicant still carrying another guild's tag or applying to other guilds during their application time with this guild will not be considered for membership.
<li>The procurement of epic weapons is as important to the guild as it is to the individual member. It is the responsibility of the member to post his potential epic battle on our bulletin board. It has been proven that the more lead time given to the membership, the more forces can be rallied. Do not expect to put together an epic battle within an hour and expect the guild to leave established groups to join you.
<li>Members are requested to participate in as many Guild events as possible. We recognize that this is your game and therefore this policy will not be enforced in any detrimental way. Nevertheless, sharing your time with your fellow Guild members is to the benefit of the entire Guild.
<li>Loot distribution is at the total discretion of the raid leaders, and will be posted on the guild raid forum prior to the raid. If you do not agree, then do not join. The merit system will be employed most often, but the raid leaders will make all loot decisions. Furthermore, those raid participants who choose to lead rather than cooperate, who argue with loot decisions or who attempt to force the direction of the raid may be asked to leave. A more definitive raid policy is currently being written.
<li>Members are encouraged to join the Nexus Of Dreams mailing list for the purpose of polling on issues and matters that are more immediate than a bulletin board posting. Leave a message on website to be placed on this list. Members are also required to keep the their current status and alts on Guildmagic. All characters who wear the Nexus Of Dreams guildtag should be listed and their levels should be current. For information on how to do this, go to Guildmagic.com, or ask one of your guild members for help.
<li>Never forget that Everquest is a game. Real life should never be confused with Everquest and vice versa. The Guild firmly believes that real life should always take priority over the game, and a member will never be asked to compromise that fact. Your time is your own and you will never be put upon to play the game at a time which is inconvenient to you. Conversely, whilst playing the game you are a representative of Nexus Of Dreams at all times, and that guild tag stands for honour, respect, enjoyment and a high moral stature. No one will be allowed to ruin the outstanding reputation of Nexus Of Dreams in any way, shape or form.
