						<h1>Dear Nexus of Dreams and guests,</h1>
						<p>Welcome to the Nexus of Dreams website........</p>
						<p>The guild has moved on leaps and bounds over the past month. We have seen
							our first promotee from our feeder guild Dreamres of Nexus, and welcome
							Tlor Windrunner with open arms. We hope he has as much fun in Nexus of Dreams as he
							did in Dreamers of Nexus.</p>
							
						<p>	Not only this, but over the past few weeks Nexus of Dreams had been having 
							talks with Valour of Lost Souls regarding a proposed merger. Firstly, I'd
							like to thank its members for the way they responded to the approach and
							the friendly attitudes that they have shown us. Since then, the merger has
							been done, ad I must say that the members from Valour of Lost Souls seem to
							be fitting in nicely and adding that little bit extra to the spirit of
							Nexus of Dreams.</p>
							
						<p>With such exciting events continuing to increase the size, stature and
							knowledge of our guild, we continue to venture forward together. Recently
							raids to Dragon Necropolis, Plane of Fear and Chardok have shown people
							what we are able to achieve.</p>
							
						<p>Nexus of Dreams has now grown to have well over 180 members and has been foraging for
							peoples epics throughout all of Norrath. I'd like to say a big 'well done'
							to two of our members who recently completed their epics, Sebillian and
							Iztok.</p>
							
						<p>Regards<br><img src="images/loronith.gif" width="72" height="30" border="0" alt="Loronith"><br><small>*Never fear Loronith is here*</small></p>
