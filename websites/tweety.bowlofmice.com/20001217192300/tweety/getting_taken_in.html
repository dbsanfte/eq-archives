<p><i>"Ain't we all blind in the dark!" said Diggle.<br><br>
"But it isn't dark, you poor stupid Dwarfs," said Lucy. "Can't you see? Look up! Look round! Can't you see the sky and the trees and the flowers? Can't you see me?" <br><br>
"How in the name of all Humbug can I see what ain't there? And how can I see you anymore than you can see me in this pitch blackness?"<br><br>
…<br><br>
"Aslan," said Lucy through her tears, "could you - will you - do something for these poor Dwarfs?" <br><br>
"Dearest," said Aslan, "I will show you both what I can, and what I cannot, do." He came close to the Dwarfs and gave a long growl…But the Dwarfs said to one another, "Hear that? That's the gang at the other end of the stable. Trying to frighten us. They do it with a machine of some kind. Don't take any notice. They won't take US in again!"<br><br>
"…A glorious feast appeared on the Dwarfs' knees…But it wasn't much use. They began eating and drinking greedily enough, but it was clear they couldn't taste it properly. They thought they were eating and drinking only the sort of things you might find in a stable…But very soon every Dwarf began suspecting that every other Dwarf had found something nicer than he had, and they started grabbing and snatching, and went on to quarreling, till in a few minutes there was a free fight…But when at last they sat down to nurse their black eyes and their bleeding noses, they all said:<br><br>
"Well, at any rate there's no Humbug here. We haven't let anyone take us in. The Dwarfs are for the Dwarfs."<br><br>
"You see," said Aslan. "They…are so afraid of being taken in that they cannot be taken out…"</i><br><br>
From <u>The Last Battle</u>, by C.S. Lewis
</p>
<p>Gamers who enjoy MMORPGs are in a sad state right now. We've been beaten with the banning stick, whacked with the nerf bat, and had discussions of ethics that would bore the most militant coffeehouse moralist to death. Every game out there has its problems, be it cheating, exploiting, or abusive behavior from the game makers themselves. The only company out there that seems to care about their customers managed to create the ugliest world ever seen in terms of graphics.</p>
<p>So, our eyes turn collectively to the new age of multiplayer games, muttering under our breath. "Just wait until Shadowbane comes out, my guild is going to own all of you." "Horizons is going to kick ass, wait and see." "I'm going to run my own Neverwinter Nights game, and let me tell you, what (insert company name here) knows about running quests could fit in my rectum." "Dawn is going to show everyone what a really immersive world looks like." "Anarchy Online, that's going to show them all." "I got fifty bucks on Rune Conquest, man."</p>
<p>We're so desperate for The Next Big Thing that it doesn't take much to fire up the community. On nothing more than rumors, we set up fansites, we sign up for betas, we download concept art for our desktop wallpaper. We get on message boards, and we argue about elements of a game that doesn't even exist. The designers fan the flames as much as possible, because the more people frothing over a non-existent game, the more funding the newcomers get access to. And furthermore, the trend of slapping up a website for a non-existent game is growing. </p>
<p>Everyone has seen the remarkable success of Shadowbane and their guerilla marketing tactics and learned the wrong lessons. "Gosh, Cletus, them Shadowbane fellas had thousands of people creaming their shorts before they were through making an environment! All we have to do is make a website and get an interview! Yee ha!" Yeah, well, Shadowbane and others like them ALREADY HAD A GAME CONCEPT before they tossed up the website, complete with rules, magic system, communications, all the goodies. They tossed up their site very early in the process to build anticipation, and it worked. The Cletus People only noticed the "tossing site up early to create frothing gamers" part, and conveniently neglected the "have a game" bits.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I anticipate failure for many of these hopefuls, because I see no conceivable way they can possibly live up to their hype. We as a community have a tendency to project all our hopes for (insert personal preference here) into a new game before that game has any form or focus. With the current multiplayers, we didn't know what to expect. Now we think we know what a new game will be like before it even releases alpha screenshots. And, the flip side of rabid fandom, we are just as quick to criticize and flame a game concept before they've done anything more than discuss their dream. We think we know what Achilles heel a game will have before they code a single line. A plague on both these houses!</p>
<p>Furthermore, we've been so brutalized by the twin clubs of Ban and Nerf that I'm not sure we'd know a good game if it got shoved up our ass. We're all jumpy as hell, quick to see cheats and inconsistent thinking where none exist. The slightest idiocy from a designer is sure to get a reaction from the masses, who justifiably have a "fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me" mentality. While I applaud the tendency to shoo away those companies who are unprepared to deal with reality, I'm wondering how many potential ideas have been crushed. If you think I'm referring to Dawn here, you're partially right. I sent a list of real questions regarding server ownership, staffing numbers, and hypothetical situations to Glitchless and got ignored. Apparently, only fluffy questions about "your dream game" are acceptable. A week later, I see from the website that they're not taking any questions until January… snicker. While I'm glad they've been forced into a place where they'll have to PRODUCE as opposed to slapping up a website six months too early, I'm a little disturbed at the rancor directed at them for merely having a dream. It's their own fault for learning the wrong lesson from Horizons, et al, but the harshness from the doubting public was perhaps uncalled for.</p>
<p>It feels like we're all punching our keyboards in limbo - not happy with the current state of affairs, but incapable of voting with our wallets for another six months. Meanwhile, we sit in dark stables, eating donkey shit and hay, becoming more and more paranoid. Six more months of random banning and corporate idiocy, and I think we'll be too worried about being played for suckers to play a game.</p>
