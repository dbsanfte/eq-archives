<p>Consistency. Learn it, live it, love it, morons. More future politicians are playing EQ than any other demographic, because the inconsistent bitching reminds me of congressmen screeching about family values at the same time that they're divorcing wives with cancer and sleeping with their interns. Does anybody even read what they type into their chat interfaces anymore?</p>
<p>Like the guy spending two hours in East Commons auctioning off his spare armor, and then shouting about how much he hates the spam and the lag at the tunnel mouth. If you try and point out that he is in fact contributing to the spam and the lag, he delivers a lecture as to why he has a right to be there. And then when you ask if his mother had any children that lived, he gets all offended.</p>
<p>Or the player who expresses his disapproval of your profanity by hitting his /shout STFU hotkey five or six times. You have to wonder if the guy knows what it stands for. Do you think the F stands for Frogspit? Do you think it's pronounced "stewfoo"? Is there anyone on this planet who doesn't mentally think "shut the fuck up" when they see it? I mean, my god, the same fuckwads that complain about people saying "ass" use LMAO. Wait, maybe it's pronounced "lame-o" and they're announcing their social status. If you care so much about profanity and its effect on your tender virgin ears, stop for a second and think, why would anyone want to fuck you in the ear? No, seriously, ask yourself why you're driving up your blood pressure and trying to start a Moral Majority campaign in a game populated in large part by adults that aren't known for their cozy fit with normal society. Turn on your filter, idiot.</p>
<p>Oh, but Tweety, the filter doesn't protect my innocent eyes from any really creative filth! I don't want to see anything about sucking, licking, blowing, wanking, or sperm, and the filter doesn't seem to realize how nasty those words are! And the other day, someone said "masturbate" in front of my fifteen year child! I was horrified!</p>
<p>Well, I gotta tell you pal, if your fifteen year old isn't whacking the one eyed snake every chance he gets, he can be declared legally dead. In fact, the one thing pretty much every player has in common is that they all do it. True, it's not really a topic one should be sharing with an entire zone, especially given the pictures of attendees at various Fan Faires. I mean, some of us were cursed with a hyperactive imagination, and we form mental images at the drop of a mousepad. Ye gods, the horror. No wonder people who don't play computer games prefers to think of us all as asexual virgins incapable of mating. The idea of the average hard core gamer getting naked is enough to terrify a porn star. And the well adjusted gamers who do get laid regularly don't usually discuss it in zone wide chat.</p>
<p>But here's a thought - if you got all offended at something crude, and the offending parties kept going, they were trying to piss you off. Probably because you're so damn entertaining when you puff up like an offended chicken, and cuss at people so they will know how much you hate cussing. Did you try a calm "take it to guildchat, folks" before you started flinging monkey feces? There are other methods you can use as well, such as a direct tell, a discussion with a guild officer, or simply walking away.</p>
<p>It sure would be nice if Verant could come up with a way to deal with the zone spamming cretins who recently discovered the word "fuck," though. Sometimes polite requests fail, and the purveyors of profanity step up their attempts to drive you insane. Let's start a petition drive, and get some help from the game designers. There's got to be a way you can filter out people. Maybe a backslash command like /say or /tell. Something simple to remember, like "ignore." Eh? There already IS an /ignore command? You're kidding! I had no idea! It must be a big secret, because there's no way people would prefer to get into an hour long discussion on what makes certain words offensive. Who would want to waste their playtime and get hysterical over certain words and people if they could ignore the cretin and go on their merry way?</p>
<p>I've got a dirty, nasty word for people that can, without a hint of irony, call someone a motherfucker to express their disapproval of his potty mouth. It's "hypocrite." Please keep your hypocrisy in your own guild chat. I don't want my kids exposed to that kind of filth.</p>
