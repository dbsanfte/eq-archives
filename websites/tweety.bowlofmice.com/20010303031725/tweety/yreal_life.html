<p>Sweaty, travel-stained, and bruised, I congratulated my army on yet another successful campaign against the orcs. I accepted their shouts of support and loyalty, wiped away a tear of pride, and began to set up my tent for the night. It was time to log into the Real World™. It was a game I didn't much care for, but it was somehow compelling. I felt like I had to do it… ye gad, an addiction! I made a mental note to suggest forming a support group at the next Freeport Town Council. If I could become addicted to Real Life™, any of my people could fall victim. Ten seconds, five, zero…quit, exit, exit, and all was silence.</p>
<p>I appeared at my bind point, a Basement Lair. I looked at my surroundings in distaste. The graphics were excellent - too good, actually, as I could see every crumpled fast food bag, every overflowing ashtray, every disheveled pile of printouts. I considered cleaning up the mess, but my stamina was low and I was receiving the message that I was out of food and drink.</p>
<p>I went upstairs to the Refrigerator. Not to criticize the Real Life™ designers, as I've heard that such hubris can lead to banning and suspension, but there are some serious flaws in this area. I can only see the things in the front of the Refrigerator. If I accidentally put something into it, it appears to vanish and I have to take everything in the front OUT just to retrieve my original item. The same thing happens with the Closet, Attic Space, and Tool Shed areas.</p>
<p>It was time to change my appearance. I retrieved items from the Closet Vault area, selecting cold resist gear to suit the day. Another gripe with the game - no matter how much care I take to select attractive gear, the graphic always shows a rumpled and disheveled person. The game makers informed me that this is a result of the way I rolled the character at the beginning. I chose a standard human avatar, and I put all my extra points into INT stats. Sometimes I think I should have put a few points into CHA or WIS., or perhaps chosen a different race. The Supermodel race (for those of you who have managed to avoid playing Real Life™, they are similar to high elven women) certainly seems to have nothing but advantages.</p>
<p>Sure, people say you can reroll a character, but I've been using this avatar for quite a while, and I really don't want to go through building up trade skills again. Don't get me started on how long it takes to work up some of these skills, and how expensive it is. I made the error of borrowing money from an NPC called Sally May to get my trade skills up to workable levels, and I'm going to be paying that bitch back until the end of time.</p>
<p>At level 16, I got the transport line of spells, and although I still fizzle occasionally, I find the spell indispensable. I got into my vehicle, and entered the main part of the server. It was incredibly crowded, and the lag on the Highway areas was ridiculous. The game makers had no idea how popular it would become, and areas designed for several hundred regularly see thousands of avatars attempting to use the same resources. The crowding engenders several problems beyond simple lag. People often become violent, attempting to kill one another while waiting their turn to camp the Parking Space and Turn Lane spawns. I consumed a potion of Indifference To People, and wedged my vehicle into a Parking Spot. I was forced to use the /rude command several times, and no less than four people went on my /ignore list in less than an hour.</p>
<p>The most pointless part of the game takes the longest, provides the least enjoyment,  and requires no skills or enthusiasm. I spent many hours in a small, eight foot by eight foot area with cloth walls and no door. I moved papers from one pile to another. I pretended that what I did mattered. I pretended that if the game crashed tomorrow, someone would notice if my job went undone. I pretended that creativity and originality were unimportant and unnecessary. I left early to go to the merchant area.</p>
<p>The Merchant Areas are badly designed. Thousands of items ostensibly for sale, yet the Cashier NPC is the rarest of the rare spawns. I searched for a Cashier for hours, and checked all the known spawn points, and found nothing. Finally, a woman who had obviously maxed her Tracking ability shouted the location of one, and continued hailing it until all of us in need of the Return Ugly Garment quest were able to arrive at the spot.</p>
<p>In another Merchant Area, I found myself in a battle with a member of the local uberguild. Now, I'm not saying I hate all uberguilds and their members. Often I find that they worked very hard for what they have, and that their intent by wearing the most elite gear is not to insult casual players. Unfortunately, uber status sometimes makes people think that they are entitled to things, and that they are above waiting their turn for rare spawns. The woman may have worn the Coat of Ultimate Power, but the stats on the coat ultimately meant little in a tactical scenario. My Elbow Wield has been maxed for a dozen levels, as well as my Raised Voice skill. I rolled this character to have a very high resist to Intimidation as well. Just to rub in my victory, I insisted upon paying in cash. Exact change. Slowly.</p>
<p>I returned to my bind point, exhausted. Why do I bother to play this game, anyway? The crowding, unbalanced economy, loot hogging, beggars everywhere, lag, bad design, absolutely dreadful customer support, constant bad weather… blah. I flipped on my computer. Fourteen hours of Real Life™ at a time is more than enough.</p>
