<td align="left" valign="top">
<p>Here's some background - I've been a guide since March. I took a month
    off in protest of some seriously fucked up guide policies, and a total lack
    of communciation between VI and their customer service staff. I came
    back to discover Verant got their shit together, and now it's the players
    that suck. Some of you assholes are up way past your bedtime.</p>
<p>Get a clue, pissants - Neither I, nor anyone else breathing actually gives
    a shit about how so and so stole your orc. Furthermore, no one cares
    that you lost the roll for whatever piece of crap weapon, because guess
    what? In five levels that piece of trash will be on your fourth twink and
    you'll be complaining about some other l33t weapon. (Note to
    a_pissant00: DO you know how retarded you sound petitioning over
    how you were ripped off AFTER YOU ROLLED FOR IT AND LOST?
    What the fuck do you think I'm going to do? That's right, genius, I'm
    going to ask your group TO ROLL FOR THE ITEM. If you already rolled,
    I'm not going to do anything but ROLL my eyes and curse the malformed
    sperm that somehow beat out all the healthy ones and created you in
    some horrible genetic accident.)</p>
<p>Next, the guide rezz. NOBODY over level 20 should be confused or
    surprised by the incredibly limited powers a guide has. I can rezz you if
    1) You zoned into lava, 2) Died due to Verant crashing (not you and your
    dial up, VERANT), and 3) Died to a confirmed bug. Otherwise, I can't do
    it. I would love to, but I can't. I have died to plenty of un-confirmed bugs
    myself, I know it sucks, and I still can't do it. It's not all about you and
    how I hate you because you aren't in an uber guild. Guess what, moron?
    I DON'T PLAY ON YOUR SERVER. I do not know, nor do I give two
    shits about the status of the guilds on your server. &gt;Elite Cockjockeys&lt;
    and &gt: Lords of Jizz&lt; means exactly the same to me - NOTHING. I rezz
    every single person I can, because I know exactly how much losing a
    week's worth of work to something not my fault sucks. If I don't rezz you,
    it isn't personal. So shut the fuck up about how I would have done it if
    you were a member of &gt;Dancing Dickbeaters&lt;.</p>
<p>Let's move on to sending tells to a guide. I logged in tonight to find
    myself the only guide with count 'em FORTY petitions waiting to be
    answered. Sorry, Mr. I can't find my super twinked body and I'm only
    level 2 and a forty minute walk to my corpse. Not only do people like you
    disgust me on general principles, but the guy who's been waiting for
    three hours stuck on a gate in Permafrost TAKES PRIORITY OVER
    YOU. Read the rules, dipshit. I take calls by petition, not by your sad
    sack tell of woe. And cussing at me, screaming at me, and telling me
    what a rotten person I am makes me accidentally camp out when I finally
    clear the monster backup and get to your whiny ass. Don't send me tells,
    assholes. The ten minutes I end up wasting asking you nicely to send a
    petition (or if you sent one, the twenty minutes I spend telling you it's not
    your turn yet) means that much longer of a wait.</p>
<p>Play nice policies. My personal feelings aside (lay off the wacky weed,
    Verant), I get to enforce it. Do you know how much I hate you at the end
    of a long shift? What kind of asshole thinks the king room in Lower Guk
    can be shared by TWO GROUPS OF 12? Conversely, what kind of
    screaming cocksucker thinks it's okay to camp the king room for 36
    hours? I think you both suck. The only people lamer than you are the
    ones that PNP over derv camps in North Ro and then act surprised
    when I send one group to the DESERTED derv camp a 30 second walk
    away.</p>
<p>Boats. Hey, Einstein, before you petition me that the boats are broken,
    do an /ooc and find out when the boat left. If it was two minutes ago, IT'S
    NOT HERE YET.</p>
<p>Quests. All I have to say to you phat lewt motherfuckers who have
    wrecked every quest I've been involved in is grow up, shut up, go back
    to Quake or whatever blow shit up video game you came from, and get
    the fuck away from the quest area. It's your ten bucks, go somewhere
    and kill stuff. Why the hell do you feel compelled to ruin the once every
    blue moon event we have for the seven people (who ALSO pay the ten
    bucks) who actually want to role play?</p>
<p>Illiterate people. I am NOT talking about the English as a second
    language kids. I go through those slowly and calmly, and more than
    once I've resorted to typing /ooc Anyone in this zone speak BOTH
    Japanese and English? By illiterate, I mean you fucking cretins who
    send me petitions that read "Ur gona get my coprse rezzed, plz." What
    the hell am I, psychic? How did you die, where did you die, and so on is
    stuff I need. If you tell me in a format I can comprehend without calling
    over my twelve year old neighbor, I will send you a tell that says, "Hang
    on, let me check out your corpse. Yep, you died to that bug all right.
    Here's your rezz. Good luck, friend." Your fucking cryptic petitions mean
    ten minutes of agonizingly rotten typing and stupidity that have me
    wondering where the hell I left my universal translator. Plus, any petition
    I get in dewdspeak automatically biases me against you. Why? Because
    it's the d00ds that are usually trying to snow me, and get something for
    nothing (like a free rez for a death caused by jumping off a wizard spire
    with 150 HP), and who feel entitled to absolutely everything.</p>
<p>The only thing more annoying than dewd petitions are the ones that say
    "Hurp." When I finally discover that "Hurp" means you were duelling
    someone named Hurp who promised not to use magic in a duel, and it
    turned out he had a 49th level cleric HP buff up, and you want me to use
    the broadcast command to tell the world what a cheater he is, I DON'T
    CARE ANYMORE.</p>
<p>Scumbags. I may not know who the uberguilds are, but I sure as hell
    know who the scumbags are. You're the one who caused a dozen
    petitions because you were spamming the zone with "So and so is a
    faggot." You're the one who trained all the bouncers to the CT entrance
    just to fuck with the kids inside trying to escape the lizard train your twin
    brother created on purpose. You're the one who backed a female wood
    elf character into a corner, calling her names and sending her foul tells.
    You're the one who tricked the player with poor English skills into
    believing a trading a GLS for a whatever-piece-of-shit was a good trade
    because you were giving him a lore item. I know you. Don't get all
    fucking bent because I told the GM not to change your name and let you
    duck your reputation. Don't be shocked that I never rule in your favor in
    PNP situations. And don't waste your time crying to another guide about
    how I hate you, because there are only six guides on the entire server
    who show up for work, and we talk.</p>
<p>Speaking of the aforementioned female wood elf and other forms of
    sexual harassment - there are two sides to this one as well. It happens.
    It happens a lot. Unsolicited tells, really truly disgusting emotes, and
    situations in which one lonely knob beater chases a female avatar from
    West Freeport to Emerald Jungle - it HAPPENS. You people sicken me.
    That said, I have very little sympathy for the person behind a character
    named Likkmebrestesses who types /em wants to have some fun with
    the brawny barbarian! and then complains when said barbarian asks if
    she'd like to go cyber in the hidden inn. Or my favorite, the gnomes who
    petition when someone says "You're the perfect height... for a b.... eer."
    Get a sense of humor already. You make it harder for people actually
    being harassed.</p>
<p>If my little hissy fit keeps ONE SINGLE IDIOT from sending a petition
    because he's going to get laughed at, I did something good today. I sure
    as hell feel better.</p>
