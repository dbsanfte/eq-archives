<p>Who Is The Brief Aside Guy?</p>
<p>No, it isn't Tweety. The Brief Aside guy is six feet tall, a professional artist, male, and a Republican. You cannot GET more different than Tweety.</p>
<p>His name is Alyxz. He would be considered an avid gamer if his attention span was long enough. We tried to start a religion once in our undergraduate days. It didn't work because neither of us had the money for the post office box we needed. Also, we ran out of beer.
<p>Now he's that friend everyone has in their life, that guy who you don't see or hear from in a year or more, and suddenly he shows up with large amounts of alcohol and funny stories, and like a complete idiot you find yourself drinking heavily and saying things like "Whoa, dude, I never thought of that." In the morning he's gone, you're got a headache, and he left his extra booze in your fridge. It's usually good beer, too.
