<p>It has been said that the computer isolates us, that when we spend too much time on the computer we lose the ability to communicate with our fellow man. I fucking wish! We've got the opposite problem in Norrath! People never shut the fuck up!</p>
<p>We've got people standing in Oasis calling each other nasty names, discussing the finer points of interracial communication in Iceclad, and expounding upon the ancestry of our fellow players and the possibility of interspecies breeding in South Karana. No, not half elves, I mean conversations in /ooc that imply one person's real life mother was a dog. Long, involved conversations about who sucks more, rangers or paladins, rage across the hills. East Commons has become such a nightmare of auction spamming that you need to be a speed reader in order to fight the orcs. And no matter what zone you're in, inevitably some lame ass dickweed will start shrieking in /shout about how druids and shamans shouldn't ask for donations in return for buffs and sows, and every alien from the planet "My Opinion Matters To Other People" has to throw in their two cents.</p>
<p>Or they share at the top of their little typed lungs about how they were done wrong by Another_Player00. Everyone understands the verb "to train." Everyone has done it and had it done to them at some point. Zone lines are the normal locations for train wrecks, yes? Because it would take serious effort to train someone anywhere else, right? WRONG. The Eastern Wastes zone is this huge expanse of snow, and every forty miles is a little camp of critters - dwarves, orcs, or giants. There's a few other wandering bands of critters, but for the most part, the zone is kinda like Antartica. If someone bears down on you looking like the drum major who leads the Macy's Parade, you could, I dunno, say, move the fuck over fifty feet and avoid being slaughtered. But, nooooo. People act like this giant expanse of snow is Lower Guk. Wide open spaces as far as the eye can see, but if they see ten giants marching in row straight for their patch of frozen wasteland, they sit right down and wait to die. And then they spend twenty minutes howling to the entire zone about how "soandso owes us four rezzes" and "he trained me on purpose." And then they send Tweety a two gazillion megabyte chat log of their heartrending experience.</p>
<p>Um, from what I can tell Eastern Waste is not exactly Karnor's Castle. The problem isn't you have nowhere to run, the problem is you have too many places to run, to the point of you can't find the damn zone line. It's not like the only spot you can perch in to camp (insert critter here) is at a certain tree or rock. If you "lose" your camp site, move your sorry ass over two trees to the left. But don't cry for twenty minutes about getting trained when you were sitting in the middle of the gate to a fort, when you could have been sitting in the middle of four thousand square miles of empty ice. You're worried about wanderers? Eek, those vicious wandering attack snow bunnies. Oh, sorry, you're talking about the wandering snow dervs. Honey, if your group of six players in their low forties can't take a single snow derv even with all of you down to 10% health and no mana, you don't belong in a video game. For that matter, I question your ability to get to the Qwiki Mart without a protective helmet. </p>
<p>But, I digress. Why do people feel compelled to share so fucking much in zone wide chatter? It's not like actually talking to real live humans, where sometimes you say things before you think about it. It's not like your verbal diarrhea just slipped out. You have to make the effort to type out your brilliant observations on "goddammit it's raining again." No kidding. It's raining. The other forty people in the zone would NEVER have noticed if hadn't been for you! Hooray, Captain Obvious has saved us from…um… our virtual selves getting virtually wet in a virtual world? Gosh! Thanks! I'll just run for a dwarf hut to protect my hairdo now that you've pointed out the weather!</p>
<p>Being a moron isn't a crime - but sharing it with the rest of us should be.</p>
