<p>Humans are nothing if not predictable. Since Tuesday, we've been passing through the stages of psychological trauma right on our efficient little All-American post-Freudian-analysis schedules. Disbelief. Shock. Horror. Grief. Anger. There are other stages, but collectively we seem to be getting to anger and staying there.</p>
<p>Newsflash, nimrods, stop taking it out on your fucking neighbors. Yeah, I said neighbors. The guy who runs the gas station by your house isn't related to Osama, he's from India. Stop spitting on the floor. The guy works twenty hours a day to catch his piece of the American dream, and you, Mr. Phlegm, still have a wet back from when your mother swam the Rio Grande with you as a papoose, hombre. This is a nation of immigrants. All of you fuckstains got off a boat at some point, so keep your mucus where it belongs. The fact that this guy is having to keep a baseball bat by the cash register is not okay with me.</p>
<p>That man who runs the Islamic bookstore down the street, who is today sweeping broken glass out of his carpets? He's not packing heat and bombing buildings. Not only is he pushing eighty, but he's a second generation immigrant. He goes to mosque about as often as you go to church, which prior to Tuesday was not all that fucking often. He likes bagels with strawberry cream cheese. His grandson is in college and on an ROTC scholarship. The kid wants to be a Marine when he grows up. That family is contributing more to the United States than some shitkicker with a brick and a Sharpie is ever going to.</p>
<p>And finally, you assholes spouting off about how Muslims don't respect women? Get the fuck off your high horse, because you just treated a woman like complete and total shit. The woman in a head scarf and tunic is not less of a woman because she isn't rubbing her tits in your face, American style.</p>
<p>Let's face it, folks, Americans are pretty fucking stupid when it comes to making fine ethnic distinctions. Ten bucks to the first adolescent from middle America who can reliably tell the difference between an Israeli and a Palestinian at first glance. Hell, a hundred bucks to the average middle aged white guy who can tell the difference between a Vietnamese man and a Cambodian. A Chinese woman and a Korean. A Morrocan and an Egyptian. Is my point clear yet? You don't fucking know, so shut your hole before you accost a fellow American on the bus. This country means just as much, if not more, to someone who packed up his shit and left behind repression and war to come here to enjoy the freedoms of religion and speech that are NOT universally enjoyed. The people who were born and bred here love their country as much as you do.</p>
<p>Aren't things bad enough this week without adding more useless, pointless hate? Don't we have enough blood without adding that of a teenage girl in a head scarf? Is the Pentagon going to stop burning because you set fire to a mosque? We cannot afford to turn on each other like this.</p>
<p>If you're going to hate an American, hate the little piece of walking feces who logged into Everquest with a character named OsamabinLadin and started shouting about how we deserved to burn. Hate Jerry fucking Falwell, who said "liberal civil liberties groups, feminists, homosexuals and abortion rights supporters bear partial responsibility for Tuesday's terrorist attacks because their actions have turned God's anger against America." This hatemongering asshole said, "God continues to lift the curtain and allow the enemies of America to give us probably what we deserve." (Friday's Washington Post is where I got this.) Hate the people cheering for the destruction of the symbols of a nation that I may often disagree with, but what is nevertheless the best country in the world.</p>
<p>Don't hate your neighbors. You will need their support in the days ahead.</p>
