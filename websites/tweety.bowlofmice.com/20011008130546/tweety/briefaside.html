<p>DISCLAIMER: A Brief Aside is not written by Tweety! Check the Aside Archives for information on the author, and stop pestering her. Tweety and Alyxz have been known to disagree. 

<span class="yellow" style="font-size:18px;">
<p>So where the hell has Alyxz been during this time of terrible crisis?
<p>So many have written, requesting my sage-like advice (or a cheap laugh…though we all know there's no fundamental difference) and yet I've been silent.
<p>Shit happens.  True to form, I won't bore you with the boring shit, suffice it to say, I stopped writing during the commotion of moving.  I moved, of all places to Washington DC, so I could take a job less than a quarter mile from the Pentagon.
<p>It's been an interesting week, but time for me now to say a few words.
<p>***
<p>I want to talk a moment about political parties.  I know they're not really funny unless you like watching our leaders fuck the sheep that feed them, but I want to talk about them anyway.
<p>I purposefully have always avoided discussing my own party affiliation in the Brief Asides.  As much as I love a good debate (and enjoy having people disagree with me for their own mindless reasons) I never wanted to get into what I think is a tiresome and fairly pointless debate…not to mention almost instant disqualification as being worth listening to, as soon as the masses find out you're from "The Other Side."
<p>So what party do I belong to?  Neither.  Tweety thinks I'm Republican, mostly because I take enormous delight in playing the devil's advocate, and since most (all) of my friends are artists, I get to argue the fascist side.  The truth is, I'm not.  I am not, nor have I ever registered with the Republican Party.  Nor will I ever, unless they stop being lying hypocritical bigots.
<p>I'm not a Democrat either.  They tend to be more well spoken and better educated as a whole (BROAD GENERALIZATION, calm down you rightist fucks), but they also tend to be completely close-minded any and every-time an opinion is expressed by "The Other Side" even if it's the very same opinion they themselves expressed five seconds ago.
<p>I tend to be fairly anti-establishment.  I don't like our government, I want it to keep me safe, then go away.
<p>Everything is different now.  Right now Republicans are hugging Democrats and singing campfire songs on the steps of the capital.
<p>People my age have never lived in a country that liked itself.  We've never seen people standing by the side of the road waving flags for no reason other than because they mean it.  We've never seen a president who honestly gave a rat's ass what Congress wanted, nor have we ever seen a congress that applauded the President where we weren't left thinking "hypocritical slime."
<p>I think, just this once, it's okay to stand by our President.  I think it's okay to show respect to our congressmen and women.
<p>I surprise myself to see that I like patriotism.  Maybe it won't last, but I intend to enjoy it for the brief moment that it does.  I like my government.  I never really have before, and it feels good.
<p>***
<p>The dictionary, is the jigsaw puzzle of books.
<p>***
<p>For those who read the last edition, the Dr. Kevorkian thing spawned a lot of great feedback.  Most of it in favor of euthanasia (under the supervision of qualified medical professionals).  All of it thoughtful, some of it emotional, and they all gave me a lot to think about.
<p>I don't respond to most of the E-mails I get.  Most of them don't need a response, but if you're wondering, I do read every one of them gleefully.  The asides were born on the old America Online message boards and originally intended as nothing more than a way of starting some good conversations.
<p>Thanks for writing, your writing keeps me writing.
<p>***
<p>Five a day.  Five spiders a day I continued to kill, since moving into that rat hole apartment.  Why does everyone I meet always want 'a place in the country.'  My happy little cottage in the woods was practically the spider Vatican.  AND I HAD A FREAKING SQUIRREL LIVING IN MY ATTIC.  I could hear him scratching around up there at night and all I could think is "Why don't you eat some of these spiders you furry little fuck?"
<p>As I mentioned earlier, I moved back to the city.  I surrendered.  The war is lost and I am in full retreat.  I have spent my last night in Menzoberranzan. (I actually read an RA Salvatore book while living in that place...dumb move).
<p>Goodbye Satan's avatars.  You will not be missed.
<p>***
<p>I really don't have much else to say.  I wanted to write some funny stuff, but I just don't feel all that funny at the moment.  Sorry I got your hopes up.  Just a few quick notes and I'll wrap it up (I'll try to write something good for you this weekend, to make up for wasting your time on this week).
<p>Congratulations Karl and Mia, I know the kid will be perfect, whatever it turns out to be, and I hope it's just like you, the world needs more.
<p>Hang in there Generation X, you may get a purpose like you hoped, though we'd always hoped it wouldn't be this.
<p>And last..in the hopes that I get more mail: Is Osama bin Laden wearing a Donald Duckesque Sailor hat?  If so..why?
<p>***
<p>Send whiny ass complaints to Alyxz@aol.com. (This address also works for questions, comments, photos, marriage proposals, and bids on pictures of Tweety..I have 'em, and she must fear me.)
<p><i>(Editor's Note: The fuck he says. The advantage to Mr. Brief Aside having moved into my house as the newest roommate in this den of slack is that I can intercept outgoing packages.)</i>
