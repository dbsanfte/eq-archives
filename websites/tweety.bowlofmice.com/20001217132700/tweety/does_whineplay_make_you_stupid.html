<p>Normally, I, like most of you, avoid even so much as READING Whineplay unless some nice
   website editor was kind enough to link directly to the pertinent comments for me. Let me give
   some advice to any Whineplay posters who accidentally wandered into my site: If you have a
   learning disability that prevents you from writing something clearly and correctly, write a draft
   first. After you've edited the material, and had a friend check it over, use the copy and paste
   functions to make your post. If you already have good English skills, ignore me, I'm not talking
   to you. As for the rest of you: RUN, do not walk, to the nearest veterinarian and ask if he
   could just this once make an exception and perform a spaying or a neutering on a human.</p>
<p>What got my panties in a bunch? Well, I was over at Whineplay, reading various comments
   made about my person and possible ancestry. I had been sent there by a link. Just for kicks, I
   looked at other topics written that day. Whew! Couldn't even understand some of them, with
   all the errors. The ones I COULD understand were so shrill, so pouty, and so annoying I
   suddenly realized why Abashi occasionally channels a satanic minion. Hell, I snapped, no
   reason why he can't do it. His barrage of crap, whining, and stupidity has been heavier and
   more constant than mine ever was. (Although he's paid, and I wasn't.... anyway....) For
   instance, "So let me get this straight, guides can't check any logs, they can't verify bugged
   corpses, they can't check trade logs or zone logs, they can't check chat logs and history from
   abusive players, and they can't verify bugs in a quest...I'm getting real sick of it." This from a
   doofus who was ranting about how much he hated guides. Um... upon reading your post, Mr.
   Doofus, I conclude guides told you all those things. You know how I know? THEY'RE ALL
   TRUE! What, did you think the guide was lying to you? Did you think they were making it up
   just to screw with you? Talk about shooting the messenger. You've got some serious
   misdirected anger, pal. When your mom said it was raining, did you accuse her of spraying the
   front window with the hose?</p>
<p>I simply do not understand why anyone would want to shout to the world how ignorant he is.
   Remember The Princess Bride? "Inconceivable!" "You keep using that word. I do not think it
   means what you think it means." Do you have dictionaries in your house? Do you USE the
   dictionary function that has come with every computer since at least 1993? How did you
   manage to get out of junior high without a basic knowledge of spelling and grammar? Yeah
   Tweety, but why do you give a damn? Well, precious, I care because you people make us all
   look stupid. Verant apparently relies on Whineplay to give them the pulse of their customer.
   They act as though their customers are stupid, whiny crybabies with nothing but selfish intent.
   Hell, if I only read Whineplay, I'd think that too! Most of the policies that have come splurting
   from the collective Verant anus have been aimed at the moronic, the childish, the ignorant, and
   the selfish. The policies that prevent Verant from giving any useful information to their guides
   are in response to the idiots that would twink their friends, powerlevel the in-crowd, and ruin
   the surprise of GM Quests. Verant has an attitude that the customer is the enemy, and good
   god, I'm not sure that's entirely a bad attitude IF they think their average customer is a
   Whineplay poster. </p>
<p>These people aren't the majority (ooh, my favorite theme). 99% of my email is extremely well
   written, and the ones that do wander in with things that make you go HMMM end up having
   an email address indicating the author's country of origin to be NOT THE USA. The nice
   people who posted on my behalf were as a rule logical and reasonable. Not to mention
   concise and to the point. So, of course, the threads in support of me were locked and
   deleted. So, no more Bring Back Tweety posts. I want all of you with some spare time on
   your hands to head right over to Whineplay, and put together a thread (not fifteen threads,
   whoever gets there first should start it - call it I Am Your Average Customer - everyone else
   search for that topic, it'll scroll off the front screen pretty fast if only a couple people post). I
   want you to state that you are the average customer. An intelligent, reasonable adult with
   good communication skills. A non-whining, non-mewling human being. A person capable of
   making a distinction between right and wrong, and deserving of respect from others and the
   company. And tell them Tweety sent you.</p>
