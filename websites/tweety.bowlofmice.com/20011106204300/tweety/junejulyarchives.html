<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE - 7/4/01</p>
<p>I'm writing this as my ponytail drips dry. Me, a couple old college friends, and Lum decided to go see the famous Washington DC fireworks tonight. ("Hey, you guys read Lum the Mad? I got Lum in my bathroom!" "Aargh.") Scattered showers were on the menu, and sure enough, upon our arrival in our nation's capital, there was a brief spattering of rain and it ended. We went in search of food, and discovered that a helping of BBQ was seven dollars. People watching commenced, and we mocked people in umbrella hats. We saw a sign reading "JESUS." ("You think that's him?" "No, he's probably for sale for seven dollars.") We left the nice dry tent we'd been hiding under and headed up to the Washington Phallic Symbol - at which point we sat and watched as animals walked past us in pairs. The women were all in favor of waiting it out, but after a half an hour of a torrential downpour, the men voted to head for the train. We did, and discovered how nice and friendly cops are when they feel threatened by large crowds. ("I'm going to go tell that cop that he's not helping the situation when he's rude." "No, you're not. He doesn't have to be nice, he has a gun.")</p>
<p>When I got to the station near my house, I heard boom boom noises. I looked out over the parking lot, and there, slightly obscured by clouds and thunderheads, were the glorious DC fireworks. The moral of this story is LISTEN TO THE WOMEN IN YOUR GROUP, YOU IMPATIENT BASTARDS.</p>
<p>Sorry the updates are so sporadic. If I leave my house at 7:00 AM, and take the train, I can be to the office by nine. If I leave at 7:00, and ride in with a friend, I get there by 7:45. This is not my favorite hour of the day. Even starting so godawful early, I still don't get home until 9:00 PM on occasion, which doesn't leave a lot of time for writing. And a number of the things that spring to mind at the end of such a day are not always printable. But I got one today I just can't resist. Enjoy.</p>   
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE - 6/25/01</p>   
<p>All my life I have chosen slow and drawn out agony as opposed to one big ouch and it's over. When it came time to express my early 1990s individualism by permanently scarring myself, I went with a tattoo instead of an odd piercing, because I was afraid the piercing needle would hurt. Other kids yell banzai, and leap into icy water, but not me. I twitch and gasp and inch my way in. I've been told watching me take off a bandaid is physically painful.
<p>So it is with my "new" identity. Instead of saying, well shit, every weirdo, wacko, and weenie out there is eventually going to know my real name and what I look like, I'm ooching and ouching my way in. Against my better judgment, and with a silent prayer that my mother remain in Southeast Asia (dad's on a government assignment) so she'll never hear my name used as a pejorative, I signed up for a zillion DAoC boards with my actual name. I behaved like a mature adult and did NOT actually curl into the fetal position after doing so, but it was a close call. But if you were wondering, yes, my name really is Sanya. Pronounced "sahn-yuh" NOT "sain-yuh." Shudder. Yuck. I'd feel less exposed if I tap-danced naked on a Beltway overpass. With orange body paint. With a siren strapped to my head. May all the powers that be heap blessings on Goe, who found the <a href="http://www.aafunnypictures.com/pics/imagepages/image24.htm">picture</a> I plan to use for my bio. My last remnant of dignity is safe until I have to attend my first Fan Faire. 
<p>Then again, masquerading as a chimp to protect my dignity involves some kind of contradiction that does not bear close examination.
<p>Sorry I couldn't get this up for the Friday Feeding Frenzy, but as you might have guessed, I've been busy. Have a rant, and a fabulous week, gang.   
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE - 6/19/01</p>   
<p>Puff up! Puff up! They hate that! That's my absolute favorite line from Fern Gully. Robin Williams' character says it in reaction to a perceived threat that turns out to be harmless. Whether this applies more to me or to certain completely insane board posters I leave as an exercise for the reader. But I'll warn you, it's a close call.</p>
<p>Thanks for all the email in the past few days. I rarely answer your missives, but I read and appreciate most of it. There are exceptions. There were a number of first time visitors here this week, and a few people missed a few basic things, like, oh, my fucking GENDER. That's FEMALE, to anyone who is still frantically flagging down the clue bus. WO - MAN. I'm a chick. Jeez, read the bio already.</p>
<p>I do have to get used to the idea that everything I say can turn up anywhere now. I'm counting on you, my loyal readers who've been with me from the beginning, to back me up when outsiders ask if I really am a three foot tall chimp. The answer is yes. All my rants say is ook ook, ook. You are all simply gifted at translating my material.</p>
<p>I know I promised a rant, but Wednesday is my first day on the new job. After seeing the response over at Lum's (26 freaking pages, and I highly recommend it as the funniest thing I ever read, but PLEASE don't add to it, I am BEGGING YOU), I'm going to bounce into work and nail down their expectations of me first. I want to at least get my beagle dog her rabies update before I get fired. Instead, enjoy a new Brief Aside, and forgive its author his INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF SUCK FACTOR in taking a month to send me a new one. See you Friday.</p>   
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE - 6/17/01</p>   
<p>Well, slap my ass and call me Jesus. Tweety got a job. That's right, all you bastard temp employers out there who think eight bucks an hour with no benefits justifies me wearing pantyhose and itchy pants can all lay some lip smacking goodness on my hind end.</p>
<p>The nature of the job is why I didn't update last week. I had a juicy rant all ready to go, regarding the amazing coincidence between Verant's PVP "insignia" and the "realm points" proposed in Dark Age of Camelot. And then I got called for an interview with Dark Age of Camelot.</p>
<p>Yeah, that's right. In one of those weird twists of fate that proves that the god of my existence has one sick twisted sense of humor, I am now employed as Mythic's edition of Abashi. Please direct all complaints about me being a sell out corporate whore to www.I Don't See You Paying For My Health Insurance.com.</p>
<p>What's this mean for my site? Not much and everything. Not much in that I am going to keep it, and continue bitching and moaning. Everything in that for some reason, my new employer thinks it would be unprofessional to rant about the Company Formerly Identified as the Evil Empire. Since I am really, really sick of ramen noodles, and my dog needs shots, and my contact lenses are two years old, I agreed. Also, Mythic's CEO bought me a bagel.</p>
<p>But read over the old rants. The vast majority haven't been directly anti-Evil Empire. Anti-dewd, anti-stupidity, yeah. Having some fun at the expense of gimp toolboxes that confuse "a life" with "a hobby," yeah. And in the grand scheme of things, my 1500 regular fans are a drop in the market bucket. So let's see if I can keep a website AND a job.</p>
<p>The next rant will go up in the next day or two; I just thought the idea of me in the gaming industry would be enough of a laugh to start your week with. See you later, gang.</p>   
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE - 6/8/01</p>   
<p>Listening to people debate PVP is dreadfully entertaining, especially the people who think the new Sullon Zek server rules are just peachy - except they'd prefer full looting, just like their favorite text mud. Guys, try to clear the bloodlust long enough to ask yourself this - did it take two years to get your mud gear, and if you lose your mud gear, can you get back in the fight relatively quickly? Don't know about you folks, but if my unfortunately banned high 40s monk was in her "regular" armor, a giant did maybe a bubble of damage. In her "intelligence" gear she wore for trade skill training, a hill giant could crush her like a possum on Interstate 95. If she was wandering around her bind point with no armor after an unfortunate death incident, a hearty swarm of orc pawns could take her. I don't know any full loot, full PVP muds that are that gear dependent.</p>
<p>Speaking of banning, how about that Conquest disbanding? See Lum's for the story, if you missed it. That explanation by Verant sounded convincing, but am I the only person jaded enough to think Verant is capable of taking remarks out of context and making judicious use of partial quoting? The description of the tactics used in the sleeper encounter sound… par for the course for high level battles. The rough rule of thumb I was taught to apply as a guide was if the mob can't hit the player, the player is cheating. If the monster can still hit players, the players aren't cheating. But, you know, aviaks can still kill you in the penthouse from the ground, badgers can still kill you from inside the Field of Bone wall. The solution for Verant is clear - BAN THE BADGERS! Don't fix the fucking code! We don't need no stinking ba… sorry, got carried away.</p>
<p>All right, over to your right is this week's installment of crankiness. Enjoy your weekend.</p>
