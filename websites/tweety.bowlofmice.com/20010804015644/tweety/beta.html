<p>You can't put out a game without beta testers. No matter how obsessive compulsive a designer might be, they still aren't going to catch all the things that actual players can. And while some beta players are the sort of people who just like to smirk on message boards and taunt others, most beta players are nice people who only want to help create a game. Hard working, bug finding players really trying to test out theories that looked good on paper and in practice… well… didn't work so well. Their sole reward is a warm fuzzy feeling and an eventual character wipe. These are good people, indispensable people.</p>
<p>There are also a lot of good people who would make wonderful testers, but due strictly to luck, didn't get into the beta. They hover around message boards, noses pressed wistfully to the window, submitting thoughtful ideas and asking meaningful questions. Sometimes these guys contribute as much as the actual testers. They keep the discussions fresh, and act as unofficial FAQ repositories for board newcomers. While their instant recall of every little factoid ever released by anyone even remotely associated with the game is somewhat disturbing, it must be admitted that without them the board communities would suffer.</p>
<p>Then you have the normal game fans, who are eagerly anticipating the release of their pet game. They don't have any desire to play the rough draft of anything, and all they care about is the release. Will it be smooth? Will it be stable? Will it be done? This group likes to talk to the beta testers only to get a little advance notice on what classes to keep an eye on. They do not want to beta test, and tend to resent paying for the beta that so often gets passed off as the first month of gameplay. Show this group a finished game on release, and they will love you for it.</p>
<p>And then you have the people who didn't get into the beta and they're bitter about it. They say beta players are all ass kissing losers who suck it the best. They make dire predictions as to the eventual failure of the game because nobody "good" is in the beta. They insist that a mistake must have been made, that surely they didn't get a beta account because the email telling them they were randomly chosen was just randomly lost. They email me at home and force me out of IRC channels with their spam. Did their mothers ever tell them no? What kind of moron thinks that sending me messages that say "why the fuck did you give my neighbor a beta and not me, are you stupid or something" is going to make me go out of my way to help? My "n" and "o" keys are going to explode from overuse. Calling me anything doesn't help at all, considering that I don't have anything to do with individual betas. If anyone wonders why I only spend a few minutes in chat rooms, it's because I can't answer all the normal people when the assholes are running the asylum. If you've got a legitimate concern, like your email address changed, I hear "email" works. Calling me an asshole in IRC is PROBABLY NOT THE BEST APPROACH.</p>
<p>Chill the hell out, already. Jesus. There's no secret plot against you. I can't wave my magic eight ball and make the connection between your posts of brilliance and the email address in the massive database from hell. The game is not even DONE YET. It's missing BIG HONKING CHUNKS OF CONTENT. People already in the beta are complaining about being bored because there isn't enough stuff to do, would you like the floodgates opened so everyone can fight over a couple spiders? If everyone who wanted a beta got one, it wouldn't be a damn beta test. Because, really, when all you have to do to play the game is get your grubby hands on a copy, the game is called "released." Put away the model glue, close up the paints from your Warhammer figure set, and log off the pipe bomb how-to site. You need some fresh air.</p>
