<p>Due to my thinking that no one would care about the inaccurately named "Weekly Updates" until I got email to the contrary, stuff older than 10/17 is lost forever. Since we're talking about a month and a half's worth of
   stuff, this is no great loss.</p>
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE - 9/14/01</p>
<p>What the fuck.</p>
<p>I was in my office, rocking out to some Erasure, planning on attacking a backlog of old email. Then my friend came in and said, "Did you hear? Someone bombed the World Trade Center." Then the Pentagon. And then the WTC fell, while we watched.</p>
<p>I am not old enough to remember the WTC being built. It has always been there, a part of a skyline that reminded me of the Emerald City, before I was old enough to talk about crime statistics and air pollution and the muggings in Central Park.</p>
<p>Fairfax County, Virginia, has been my home since kindergarten. I left for college, graduate school, some wild oat flinging, and then I returned. I grew up inside the Beltway. My high school friends and I used to skip school and go to demonstrations on the national mall, used to sneak out and go to dance clubs with fake IDs. I make my current home less than ten miles from the Washington Monument. When I take the train to Mythic, I pass through the Pentagon Metro station.</p>
<p>The bastards tried to blow up my HOME.</p>
<p>I don't even know what to say, yet. Except maybe that if Pearl Harbor is what made my grandparents part of "The Greatest Generation," I think I was pretty fucking happy being part of "The Bitter Slacker Generation." God, I hope all of you are okay, and that everyone's friends and family made it through Tuesday intact.</p>
<p>Let me say here on the front page that my love goes with the people in uniform who may be shipping out soon for foreign lands. Be safe, guys. I don't want to write some maudlin essay for you next Memorial Day, so take care of yourselves.</p>   
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE - 9/09/01</p>
<p>Peer. Is the madness over yet?</p>
<p>Hey, gang. I was sort of waiting for this site to drop off the top ten hit list so I could rant in peace, because you know, popular ranting about the lunatics and weenies that make up such a vocal minority in our little community of gamers might look bad coming from someone who gets paid to be nice to everyone, ESPECIALLY the lunatics and weenies. Jesus, y'all should see my email. I didn't think it was possible to top the stupid petitions a guide gets. Now I understand why I have so many fans at Verant, because the only thing that beats idiot petitions are the idiot begging letters from subliterate wankers who gnawed through the restraints and gained internet access.</p>
<p>I can't thank my regulars enough for the kind emails sent in the last two months. My life has achieved new highs of insanity, and notes from people who have been reading since I was on Geoshitties have served as a badly needed grounding point. I wish I could answer all of it, but there was just too much. Every single email was read and appreciated. A side note about email - email sent to "Tweety" but obviously intended for Sanya Thomas, Mythic Internet Relations Manager get deleted right off the bat. No offense, folks, but I'm in uncharted waters here, and that's a line between my private life and my work life that I've decided to draw.</p>
<p>Some new people have wandered over to this site, and I'm yet again getting email questioning my gender. I don't know what I can do to convince you guys. Do you need pictures of me taking a leak? For chrissake, take my word for it. That subgenre of porn is twisted.</p>
<p>Anyway, the new rant isn't terribly coherent, just a bunch of random thoughts from the last two months. But they made my friends laugh, so what the hell, they might entertain you too. See you around the loony bin, kids.</p>
