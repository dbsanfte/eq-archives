<p>This is the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, and I know my rights. If I have a problem, everyone is goddam well expected to cater to me and provide me with a support group. One that has clever bumper stickers, preferably.</p>
<p>The night I was summoned (details in an old rant for those of you new to this channel), I finished my dragon raid and created a character on my roommate's computer. I transferred every single thing I could to the mule character, leaving nothing on my level 48 self except my Seb key, my monk quest sashes, and a character that had maxed out all combat skills (including 1HB and 2HB weaponry) and swimming. The character was also pretty good at tailoring and blacksmithing. My god, my only real life skills are writing, arguing, and spoiling my dogs rotten. The sudden realization that my CHARACTER is better rounded than I am was fairly horrible, but I got over it.</p>
<p>No one but another gamer can possibly understand the attachment one forms to their alter ego. I was starting to grow bored with the game, true, and I had no plans to buy the expansion. But I wasn't quite ready to hit that cancel button when it got hit for me.</p>
<p>After a brief powerleveling stint, I got a new character (not the mule, I didn't want to risk getting my friend banned if I was caught playing on his account) up to 17, and then I quit. No heart for it, and while I appreciated the thought from all my friends, powerleveling tends to leave skills behind, and I had spent a year building all those skills. I had spent a year with my alter ego, lovingly building her into an all around ass kicking character. She had "friends" outside the guild, a good reputation, and plenty of wealth to explore her "hobbies." Sense heading and feign death WORKED, for crying out loud. Facing all that again (starting over) was too much. I had secondary characters, but whenever I got sick of getting my ass kicked by wisps I could always bring out my big girl and go solo a giant or two. Rebuilding, even with a full set of high level gear, sounded as much fun as wearing a chain mail bikini two sizes too small. In Vermont. In November.</p>
<p>So anyway, I quit. I couldn't even get on my favorite message board and say goodbye. See, my alter's name was pretty special to me, and I plan to use it again in the next game. I have no plans to get harassed by well meaning fans when I'm in the next game. </p>
<p>Besides, what was I missing? Camping? Fighting with d00dz over a spawn? Broken/impossible quests? Six hour bouts of CR? Wasting time? Losing sleep? All I was really missing was the chat room function.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I set up an eBay account. I might as well get something monetary out of the whole sorry mess, right? I have everything from the Crown of King Tranix to a stockpile of HQ pelts to Iksar Hide Boots (AC 10, str and dex +5, cha +3, HP +25, neener neener neener). I noted down the stats of each item, and prepared to reap the riches. Maybe I can score enough money to move across the country.</p>
<p>Except… I COULDN'T DO IT. I closed the browser. I sat in a little ball, rocking myself, chanting "new games out soon, new games out soon, new games out soon." 99% of the people who matter to me in a gaming sort of way are in my guild. We're going to a new game en masse. If I'm going to be an eGay ranger, the time to do it is now, not when all the new games come out and no one cares about my spiffy boots anymore.</p>
<p>Fine, I'll start my own group. Here's your twelve steps, start walking:</p>
<p>FIRST: We admit that we are powerless over EQ, and our lives are fucking completely out of control.</p>
<p>SECOND: We believe that a power greater than ourselves, at bare minimum smarter than Abashi, can restore us to sanity. </p>
<p>THIRD: We make the decision to turn our will, our lives, and our ten bucks a month to the care of Smedley, because as far as we can understand it, he's not a goddam moron like his mouthpieces are. But we made the decision, so we blame ourselves.</p>
<p>FOURTH: We make a searching and fearless inventory of all our phat lewts.</p>
<p>FIFTH: We admit on a public message board the exact nature of each and every KSing, loot yoinking, spawn stealing episode we were ever involved in. It is to be hoped that this fifth step will be enough, in that eventually all the people who read message boards will hate us and drive us out.</p>
<p>SIXTH: We hope we're ready to entirely remove our characters from our hard drives, since thus far we've proven that we're too fucking spineless to do it.</p>
<p>SEVENTH: If that fails, we humbly ask Smed to remove our characters, or possibly just the short ones, since gnomes suck. Except the one that rezzed me last week.</p>
<p>EIGHTH: Make a list of all persons we have harmed (it doesn't need to include gnomes, but you should probably include the halflings you slaughtered for the DE cleric quest, because that sure as hell wasn't very nice)(also, harming doodz doesn't count, they deserve it).</p>
<p>NINTH: Become willing to create a shaman just to SoW all the people mentioned in number eight whenever they ask. If that doesn't cure you of your EQ habit, nothing's going to.</p>
<p>TENTH: Keep checking your inventory, and admit to yourself you will never in a million years be that rich in real life if you don't quit playing EQ.</p>
<p>ELEVENTH: Seek through constant emailing and posting to get a response from customer service at Verant, asking only that you grow so pissed off at the lack of contact that you take a break from the game in protest.</p>
<p>TWELFTH: Having awakened from the narcotic-like stupor of video game addiction, try to carry the message to others that there are new games coming out next year.</p>
<p>I thought about getting keychains made, but considering the amount of backsliding, I wouldn't be able to prove you deserve it. Here's my plan: Every month you stay free of the Qrack, reward yourself with some oral sex. Tell your partner I said so.</p>
