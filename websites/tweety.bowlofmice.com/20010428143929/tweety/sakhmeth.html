<p>Horizons does NOT have a "police the jerks yourselves" approach, at least not as its core method. While the game is unlimited PvP, without artificial restrictions on why you cannot attack the guy/gal standing next to you, there are many game mechanics to funnel PvP into what the HZ community feels are proper channels for that behavior.</p>
<p>Here is a short list.</p>
<p>1) GM/NPC guardians, called the Ku'Tan, protect newbie zones. They will not prevent you from attacking, but they will respond with overwhelming and unstoppable force.</p>
<p>2) Factions and race/blood wars. Unlike many other games out there, the faction system in HZ is unyielding and incredibly harsh. If you slay more then one or two of a particular race, you will find that nearly all members of that race will either shun or attack you on sight. Also, this bad faction will have a secondary effect against races along the same alignment. So if you kill a few Dryads, do not think that the Angels will treat you kindly.</p>
<p>3) The death system. This is the most mysterious aspect of PvP control out there, as the dev team has kept this close to heart as they do not want any other game closer to release to 'borrow' the concept. What is known is that faction will affect exactly how you will resurrect once you die. If your faction with your deity is poor, you should expect to come back to life with little to no equipment, and a corresponding drop in your skill levels.</p>
<p>4) Bounty hunters. It is possible in HZ to sick NPC bounty hunters on other players, provided the person you want them to attack falls within certain guidelines. So if your character cannot defeat Sir Shitforbrains on his own, but you have a few coins to spend....</p>
<p>Horizons is not about random PvP, it is about directing and focusing PvP into the already established wars in the game.</p>
