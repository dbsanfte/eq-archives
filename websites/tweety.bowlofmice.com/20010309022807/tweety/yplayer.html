<p>It takes all types to make a world, but it only takes a few types to really drive me up a fucking wall. When I play a game with other humans, I look forward to the variety of interaction available to me - I can talk to mothers, engineers, college students, advertising executives, computer programmers, biologists, or pretty much any type of person from all over the world. This is good.</p>
<p>I'm also forced to interact with know it all, arrogant, annoying, illiterate dipshits, from all over the world. This is bad. If you recognize yourself in any of the following descriptions, please go directly to hell without collecting your goddam two hundred dollars.</p>
<p>The Know It All. This asshole knows every detail of playing my class and race, and never hesitates to give me advice, even if he doesn't actually have a character of that class and race. He criticizes the spells I cast, the disciplines I use, the way I rolled the character two years ago, my tactics, and even the way I run across a zone. He has been on every raid to every zone, pulled every mob, grouped with all the major guilds (although he isn't a member of any of them), and talks incessantly about the days of EQ beta when he was the first person to get a Froglok Crown when it still had a rez proc and five million HP. He knows every acronym, every abbreviation, and knows to the last copper piece what every tradable item in the game is worth. About the only thing this sad sack of snot doesn't know is how to interact with other people.</p>
<p>The Victim of Oral Diarrhea. Say one deeply meaningful thing to this moron, like "hello," and say goodbye to any chance of hitting reply and actually talking to the person you intended to. He'll spam you so often that every tap of the "r" key will automatically go to him. Tell him you're busy! He'll answer with "That's okay, I know you're still reading it, I'll understand if you don't answer." Tell him you'll talk to him later! "Don't you like me anymore?" Put him on ignore, and he LOGS IN ANOTHER CHARACTER TO ASK YOU WHY YOU DID IT. Insult him, and feel like a heel for kicking the Norrathian version of a puppy.</p>
<p>The Welcome Wagon. As you're calmly going about your day, bright red shouts break out across your text box. "OMFG I HAVNT SEEN U IN 4EVR!" "woot! Hi Alissamanabox! Kissies1!!1" "LAST NIGHT WAS SO KEWL WE GOTS TO HOOK UP AGAIN" "U like me! U really like me!" Just as you start going into insulin shock, they mercifully quit shouting. Get out your syringes, kids, because they aren't done. They just move into ooc, discussing every last detail of the reason they logged out last night (the cleric had a fight with her "boy firend"), the reason they're looking for new guilds (the guild leader called them useless no skill having lewt whores when he himself looted a fine steel rapier without randoming it), and primarily, that it appears to be raining. The entire zone eventually begins to vomit cries of "get a room!" and "please tell me you people aren't reproducing," at which point these long lost friends head for a new zone to start again. Don't even get me started on the "ALL HAIL THE ELECTRIC SHOCK TREATMENT RECIPIENTS" spam that occurs when someone in that guild zones into a new area.</p>
<p>The Person Who Thinks He's Roleplaying a Kender. My fantasy: Kenderboy: "What's the loc of Guk? Do you like my outfit? Has the boat left yet? WTS a manastone when I get one! Is the boat here yet? Can I have a buff? Can I have clarity? Can I have a sow? What time is it? Can I go with you? Can we have a pool, Dad? Can we have a pool, Dad? Can we have a pool, Dad?" Me: BAM! "I love the smell of napalm in the morning."</p>
<p>The Professional. God help you if you're in a group, and a fun conversation gets started about mutual friends, politics, or (a favorite of my guild) lesbian porn. This guy immediately freaks, and says, "Come on guys, let's not slack off, if you've got time to talk you've got time to pull." Ebay shutting down his four hundred auctions really crushed his dreams of a financial empire, and one tends to question two things - one, does he actually enjoy playing EQ and two, when was the last time he put on clean underwear?</p>
<p>I swear, some days I think other people were put on this earth to make the vein in my forehead twitch.</p>
