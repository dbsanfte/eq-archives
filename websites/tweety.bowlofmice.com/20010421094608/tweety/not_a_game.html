<p>It is all Matt Arnold's fault. The extent of my obsession with computers-as-toys began and ended with the Do It Yourself "programs" in Basic that came with some computer magazine. The new issue would come in, and I'd boot up the Leading Edge IBM compatible workhorse and enter in the program of the month. I had just enough skill to screw with it and change the colors. Beyond that, I used the machine to write papers for school, and play a few hot sessions of Where in the USA is Carmen Sandiego? Maybe Wheel of Fortune if I was feeling frisky. The graphics were so bad, Vanna White was frumpy and had a pink afro.</p>
<p>But I also had a copy of Wishbringer. I also had a copy of Leather Goddesses of the Phobos for about ten minutes, and my mother still takes medication to sedate her from that episode. (Like I knew what the hell the game was about, I liked Greek mythology a lot, and I thought goddesses, computer game, might be fun.) Anyway, Wishbringer had the damndest puzzles in it, and I was stuck on a thorny problem. The game was neat, but not so much fun that I just HAD to play it. I hadn't played it in awhile, and mentioned this to my friend Matt. As it turns out, he also had a copy of the game, and we decided to play it together.</p>
<p>Only, we couldn't. I don't remember the exact circumstances, but I wasn't able to go over to his house, or he to mine. So, sitting in our separate houses, we each booted up our own copies. We called each other on the phone, and we would decide our course of action and type in the same commands. Then, as we waited for his piece of shit Commodore 64 to catch up to my powerhouse machine, we'd yap about whatever came to mind. Together we explored the virtual town, spoke to the residents, collected clues, and eventually beat the game. Playing with another person brought in a whole new dimension of fun. It was social. "Demented and sad, but social."</p>
<p>So it's not too surprising I became an Everqrackhead. It was like being inside a cross between Wishbringer and a Dragonlance novel. Even the quests reminded me of Wishbringer, with the you-must-use-the-exact-right-words-or-fail process. I played like it was my new religion, sometimes getting home from work and not bothering to take off my coat until the machine was booted up. Come on, guys, admit it - you type in your password, and you go to take a leak while the server loads. You run back, select your character, and go make a snack. No minute is wasted.</p>
<p>But as much and as obsessively as I played, it was still just a game like Wishbringer. While we waited for the gerbils that powered Matt's C64 to finish gasping for air, we'd gossip about school or a hundred other things. Everquest was the same way - my friends and I would talk about movies, porn, music, or gossip about absent friends. If I couldn't log in for whatever reason, the world kept turning. I looked at the really psycho EQ fanfic, and thought, whoa, somebody needs some fresh air. I'd read the message boards, and think, Christ, what kind of moron gets so torn up over such petty crap as a campsite, or a stupid strategy error. I used to harass my best friend Mike over his attachment to his virtual friends. Can they give you a hug after a bad day? Do they make you dinner? Do they lend you money, feed your dog, put you to bed after you drink fourteen beers through a funnel? No? Then log the fuck off and talk to your real friends, idiot.</p>
<p>Then I discovered how personally I could take my character and my virtual friends. My character, who had been well-known and well-liked, was gone, and with her all the wonderful people who knew me only as that character. My link to my clan was severed, and email just wasn't the same as logging in every night to greetings and laughter. I missed the camaraderie, the raids, the teamwork, and the pride of being part of a group that kicked more ass with fewer players than anyone else out there, damn the torpedoes and bring on the lesbian porn. Why did I feel so awful? It was just a game, right?</p>
<p>Recently, my guild (that I'm still a part of, once a member always a member) went through a rough patch via email. The collective decided that one player, who in real life is a decent guy and a good friend to the people he knows well, didn't fit in with the guild. A dozen incidents had left a bad taste in some people's mouths, and he was asked to deguild his characters and not return. It was the right decision, but the whole experience was miserable for everyone, because a main part of the clan philosophy is "it's just a game, asshole." We know we aren't really our characters, we aren't really in Norrath or Arctic or wherever the clan goes next. We rarely call each other by our character names, preferring our real names. Every minute we're online together, we're always aware of the person behind the keyboard. We have a loyalty to each other that goes beyond pixels. So why did we deguild another person, who by all accounts is a good guy in real life? Why did this person have to go? It's just a game, right?</p>
<p>The answer is, it's not just a game anymore. Even if you'd rather drop dead than post melodramatic fan fiction, even if you scoff at the board weenies who take everything so deadly seriously, even if you care so little about nerfing that you have no idea who John Smedley is, it stopped being "just" a game the minute you logged in and purple flashed across your screen: "Hey, my friend, I missed you yesterday!"</p>
<p>Damn you, Matt. Look what you started.</p>
