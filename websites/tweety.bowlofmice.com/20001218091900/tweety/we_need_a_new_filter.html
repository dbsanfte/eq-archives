<p>So... if you don't want to hear nasty language, turn on /filter and henceforth see
    amusing things like "Ur a frikglun moron" and "Shnicky, that sux0r!" If listening to
    conversations about Pokemon revolt you, turn off the /ooc channel. If listening to
    the entire zone explode with derision when someone auction something at a
    pre-Kunark price strikes you as dull, then turn off /auction. At some point in the
    game's creation, Verant cared about giving the users ways to reduce irritation
    levels. We even have a chat filter for something as insignificant as guild invites.
    (What the fuck is up with that, anyway - can you imagine ANYONE playing this
    game being SO KEWL that they get bombarded with invites to the point of
    needing a filter? "No, please, you're too kind, all of you, but my l33t skillz are only
    for a guild that offers me first refusal on all uber loot and cyber sex with high elf
    enchanters." I can only pray I'm missing something here.)</p>
<p>Why, then, is there no chat filter for STUPIDITY?</p>
<p>The only flaw that I can see is that suddenly, my text screen would cease moving
    entirely in zones like, oh, let's say, KARNORS. And without text movement to give
    me the illusion of social interaction, I might realize that all I was doing was staring
    at my monitor with a slack jawed expression. But enough about me, let's talk
    about elves. Specifically, a certain elf who charged past my group so many
    goddam times with half the castle, I kept expecting him to put on little striped
    overalls and a little striped hat. (Memo to the many short bus aficionadoes in our
    viewing audience: That's an ENGINEER uniform. For a TRAIN.) You! Asshole!
    Outta the gene pool! Once was understandable, twice was acceptable, three
    times is defined as sometimes shit happens. At some point, though, you have to
    come to terms with the realization that you just plain suck too much to pull an area.
    I would love to be inside your head, listening. "Hrm, there are six things here, and
    my spells don't stick, and I don't have feign... hey! One attacked me! I didn't do
    anything to him yet! And now all his friends are helping! I better run!! (zone) Whew.
    That was close. Good thing I didn't die. HEY! I bet the room is empty now! I better
    go back in and set up camp."</p>
<p>I would love to publicly rip his head off and piss down his throat here, but see, I
    have no idea who he was. He never alerted the camping masses of his imminent
    arrival, and I always saw his teeming mass of ag before I saw him and whipped
    out an evading tactic. Hey, I've done a few raids, I know that trying to tell people
    you're getting your ass kicked and planning on running through them to get to
    safety is HARD. All you pullers who ever typed /shout terainns to
    zonge'''''''''''''''''32232 raise your hands. But there's this nifty thing called a HOTKEY
    which you can PROGRAM to AUTOMATICALLY SHOUT a warning. Did it ever
    occur to you the guy repeatedly shouting CHOO CHOO MOVE IT ER LOSE IT
    was a little too busy running to actually type that? Wait, I forgot, the rest of us are
    just mobs with better AI than the rats and bats that are more your speed. I'll bet
    you're the same Mensa Member who spam inspected me, and when I told you to
    fuck off, said "O, i thot u were a merchent." A merchant. On the platform in North
    Ro. Emoting my fool head off. In Spanish. And you at level 16. How are those
    paint chips tasting?</p>
<p>Here's another thing about pulling, mastermind. Other groups don't like it when
    you decide to solve your problem by running through them and then NOT ZONING,
    thus wiping your clusterfuck onto your victims. Oh, and you know what else? The
    fourth time you run past me, I get the idea that you know where the zone is. When
    you come past me a fifth time, and you TURN INTO MY GROUP'S ROOM with
    your monster train, PAUSE until you wipe a phantom onto me, thus agging every
    drolvarg in the area onto my group which is clearly between you and them, I feel
    like maybe you might have done it on purpose. The only other possiblity is you
    have a hard time pressing the arrow keys and jiggling the twin babies you keep in
    your tighty whities. Maybe you need to consider learning to touch the boys with
    your LEFT hand.</p>
<p>One guy who didn't at any point speak wouldn't make me dream of seeing
    "/moron filter is now *ON.* You will no longer see any text from users who can't shit
    and read at the same time," though. At least he tried let go of the coffee table and
    his security blankie in order to take a few faltering steps. It's the grand total of
    FIVE GROUPS that were camping the zone edges in Karnors that made me think
    of a /dumbfuck filter. At one point I announced the arrival of phantoms at platform
    B, and when I saw the two groups, I spun and headed for the other side. And
    found three more groups. Jesus fucking christ people, I don't want to be an
    asshole here, but if you're sitting on the tracks, don't break out the tents and trail
    mix. Don't scream at each other for mistakes made when your pull crossed paths
    with theirs. DEFINITELY don't scream at any class that has feign.</p>
<p>Another quick hint: Don't bitch at clerics for not rezzing your uberwussy ass 45
    seconds after they've busted through the zone. Chances are good they just hiked
    up their robes and bailed out of a situation gone horribly wrong, and are OOM,
    and have to heal their own battered groupmates before you get consideration.
    Bring bandages and your own goddamned cleric. Failing that, show some fucking
    gratitude. "thx" is not enough for the healer who left her group, walked halfway
    across the zone, had to zone out from a train, and then came back in to rezz you.</p>
<p>Karnor's is how big? Forty five people were in it last night, and I estimate
    twenty-five were perched right by the zone. My group of six had a different
    campsite, and I saw another group of four perched on the left moat. That means
    the rest of the zone had ten people in it. For a game that only has roughly 7%
    female players, there are an awful lot of people with no balls.</p>
