<p class="yellow">Have some email from the horse's mouth:</p>
<p>I own 3 accounts. One is Brene (53 mage) one is Isriam (52 cleric) and one is Kialani (wifes account 51 chanter, and shes a guide).<br>
 
Someone posts Sluggo's list of warnings from the guide page, on xegony.net, using an anon name. Isriam (another poster who happens to have the same name as my character, not me) tells the board admins to delete the post (had station logon). Isriam then cut and pastes it, and reposts it without the logon info.<br>
 
4 hours later, that gets deleted too. A week later, Verant bans Isriam (me) as well as all accounts played from my house. (total of 3)<br>
 
They assumed we were one and the same. Didnt ask for IP info, nothing, just banned us...
 </p>
<p class="yellow">And the newest update, straight from Verant themselves:</p>
<p>All three play accounts are reinstated until further information is
obtained. Currently we have obtained some more nformation that added some
doubt on the identity of the poster.<br><br>

<p class="yellow">Personally, I'm bitterly amused. Our pal Jacob here seems to be saying that good ol' Verant FUCKED UP. For another thing, he implied they use informers, and thus assume the risk inherent in using outsiders as their sources. How... Soviet...</p>
