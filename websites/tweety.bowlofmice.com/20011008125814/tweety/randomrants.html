<p>Tweety fans rule. You guys are the ones I keep in my mind when I'm about ready to throw my monitor across my office in despair over the fact that the people who are too fucking impaired to read the instructions on a box of condoms are the exact people who need to stop breeding. If I didn't have Tweety readers reminding me of my rants about normal players being in the majority, I could easily slip into the trap of assuming that gamers are all thinly disguised and retarded versions of the Simpson's comic book guy. Then I get a note from a Tweety regular, and think, ah, THIS is the guy I'm here to defend. THIS is the chick whose interests I'm looking out for.</p>
<p>I need to set up a schedule. Each Tweety reader will have a specific day assigned to them to send me a reality check. As it is, I have come perilously close to suggesting my employer put in an IQ test instead of a EULA click through. You fail, you get booted to desktop. If you pass, it can be assumed that you ALREADY KNOW that hacking the game is probably bad, and that calling other players an unprintable deleted expurgated bastard might get the attention of customer service. There is someone in my office who possesses a cudgel of obvious truth. He's a big guy, six foot four and solidly built. Don't make me let him loose.</p>
<p>He's not the only one of my coworkers whom I adore. One of the problems with my past attempts at full time employment is that invariably I had to work with stupid people. Not just work with, which I can handle. But the office retard is also often the one who wants to socialize after work, who wants to come over to my house and "hang." The only hanging I want to do with that person involves a rope tied into a noose. At my last job, the office retard was also my boss. My unwillingness to spend eight hours with this nimrod AND inflict several hours of post-employment boozing with her onto my tender psyche combined to make the office as comfortable as a couch decorated with broken glass.</p>
<p>But these people are different. Everyone is smart, and in many cases, smarter than I am. And they're funny. The only thing that concerns me is the relatively low population of dorks. I'm doing my best to up the dork level with my Starfleet Cadet T-shirts and ancient Mordillo posters, but the creeping virus of normalcy is defeating my puny efforts. How can we make a video game with normal people? These people go out to movies, dinner, parties, trips with their significant others. Their SPOUSES, for crying out loud. Nice, friendly spouses who do part time work on the game, or just make life normal for the people doing twelve hours or more to make this puppy.</p>
<p>I have no such luxury of normalcy. My day starts a little before eight AM, when I hit "get mail" and find out if there were problems over the previous evening. If there were, I have several hundred emails. If there weren't, I have just under a hundred. The rest of my day is spent trying to get answers to questions, getting more email, and stoking the hype machine. I'm not complaining, mind you. I love my job. I'd sleep there if I could, because at least my coworkers occasionally want to talk about something besides the damn game. When I get home is when my real work gets started, because my roommate is in beta and never shuts up about it. I begged him, please, give me an hour and talk about books or music or politics or any fucking thing besides the stupid game, I need a break. At which point he began bitching about the flaws of the game. Whee! Not even in release yet and already I'm the face of the devil! I still have no car, so I am what you might call a captive audience. I have a sign on my desk at home that says "we're still in beta, please shut up and leave me alone." It's not helping.</p>
<p>Speaking of beta, how's this for irony? Half of Verant has written me sweet little notes, asking for beta accounts for Dark Age of Camelot. Only half, because the other half has been in since beta two. Now, this is fine. We have an open, all game devs welcome, policy. Also, my rather public problems with the company formerly known as the Evil Empire were never with Verant employees as a whole. Just one or two people gave me… problems. Also, I genuinely like the individuals who make the game. How could I not? In case it wasn't patently obvious, I loved the game itself, some of that love was bound to ooze over. Still would love it if I had any free time. I'm really looking forward to meeting a bunch of them someday. The number of people professing love for my rants is pretty funny, too.</p>
<p>But what's been getting me is the number of people asking if there's anything they can do for me in return for the beta. WHY YES. THERE IS. HOW ABOUT UNBANNING ME, PEOPLE?</p>
