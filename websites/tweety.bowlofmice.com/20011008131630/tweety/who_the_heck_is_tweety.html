<p>I miss being anonymous, but getting paid helps me get over that. As the rest of the internet found out on June 20th, 2001, my real name is Sanya Thomas. Fortunately, I have an unlisted phone number.<br>
Former Server: Erollisi Marr<br>
Next game for the Bird: Shadowbane, Dark Age of Camelot<br>
Occupation: Internet Relations Manager for Mythic Entertainment. Yes, I joined the Dark Side of the Force.<br>
Favorite Authors: Robert Heinlein, Weis & Hickman, Mercedes Lackey, Tom Clancy, James Clavell, Terry Pratchett, Anne McCaffrey.<br>
Favorite Movies: If it has Jackie Chan, stuff blowing up, or Kenneth Branaugh, I like it.<br>
Current base of operations: Northern Virginia.<br>
Registered voter: Democrat, but I don't think video games cause insanity.<br>
 </p>
<p class="yellow">Warning! I do NOT have a character named Tweety. Anyone WITH a character named Tweety is full of shit if they claim to be me. I am Tweety on IRC, though.</p>
<p>Your Questions Answered: Yes, I'm female. I'm in the 25-34 demographic. People are usually surprised when they meet me, because they expect me to be taller and fatter. I went to Greensboro College and Radford University. I don't show up on film, so there are no pictures of me in the world. Stop asking.</p>
<br>
<p><span class="red">Site Rules -</span> I will never publish your name or server without your permission to do so. Any email I receive becomes my property, however, and I may quote from it if I feel like doing so. I do NOT answer DAOC related mail sent to the Tweety address. Ever. You would not like the answers. If you write to me at work, you will receive a prompt and courteous reply. This here is my private sandbox.</p>
<p>I also will not answer, continue to read, or post ANY email containing racial slurs, religious slurs, the c-word (if you don't know what I mean, you're too young to read this website), derogatory remarks as to another's sexual orientation, or xenophobic comments. I believe that those who speak such things are not sufficiently evolved to be worthy of my attention. If you don't like it, kiss my white, straight, agnostic ass, pissant.</p>
