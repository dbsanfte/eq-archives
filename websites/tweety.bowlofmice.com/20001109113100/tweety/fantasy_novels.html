<p>I'm not talking about Dragonlance, or Anne McCaffrey, or the satire of Terry Pratchett, or Ursula Le Guin. I'm not talking about Mercedes Lackey, although you can tell when she started letting her pal Larry do the writing (and he's just... not as good. Stick to music, pal). The state of modern fantasy reminds me of the early pulp Sci-Fi - lame, trite, improbable, schmaltz-ridden bullshit written for ignorant adolescent males primarily wondering when the alien with big tits (the female wood elf with big tits) was going to take off her spacesuit (collection of leather straps laughingly referred to as "armor"). (What's up with that? I've actually tried on those leather and chain bikinis you find at fantasy gatherings. I'm not exactly racked like Jugs McBoner, but the fucking thing pinched places I didn't know I had. I also know how to fight with a sword, and trust me, no fighter would wear that monstrosity.</p>
<p>Science fiction had Robert Heinlein. He came in, and made the revolutionary assumption that his readers were intelligent. The science was as sound as he could make it, and he included little things like plot, character development, and entertainment. Sex in his novels was never tacked on, always a part of the story. He blazed the trail, and brought with him guys like Asimov. Today, a science fiction reader has respect in the literary community.</p>
<p>Fantasy lovers, though... Have you ever been reading some sword 'n' sorcery novel, and whisked it out of sight when someone walked in the room? Do you keep your fantasy collection on a shelf in your room, instead of in the living room with the "literature"? When you go to bookstores, do you usually buy the same author you've been buying since high school because the odds are good the other stuff for sale is shit? In college, when the English Lit professor asked for your favorite author, did you mutter something like Maya Angelou or Virginia Woolf instead of Robert Jordan? You've got a reason to be embarrassed, but it's not your taste you should be ashamed of. It's the piss poor crap that gets inflicted on us by the publishing industry. By and large, fantasy novels read like a bad joke - A sexy elf, a dwarf, and a roguish human with a heart of gold walk into a bar...</p>
<p>Whenever someone mentions Weis and Hickman, fantasy fans immediately go into convulsions of ecstacy, and for good reason. They were the first authors to bring us intelligent fiction AND enjoy enormous commercial success. They gave us a villain who didn't twirl his mustache and leer at the maiden while cackling "A HA!" Their heroes could be selfish and stubborn and held the potential for enormous acts of hubris not seen since the Greeks. Even the gods were more nuanced than the usual ineffable cardboard cutouts. And they put their fighting women in ARMOR, not chain mail swimsuits. Tika did not have to stop mid-shield bashing and say, sorry, could we pause a sec, I need to get my nipple out of this clamp. Kitiara did not have shave her pubes to avoid inadvertant mid-flight hair plucking when her pants shifted. I'm sort of fuzzy on what Laurana's Golden General getup was, but it could probably stop arrows and sword slashes - as opposed to most fantasy getups, where all you can stop is traffic.</p>
<p>You knew I was going to head over to Everquest eventually. As a guide, I took part in quests, designed to tell some part of the backstory. Just before Kunark came out, there were a whole bunch of them involving Firiona Vie and her quest to fuck a dragon because he wiped her memory and she had loyal servants who knew what was going on but they wouldn't tell her except for hints dropped by the drunken sailor. I didn't mind that the characters were caricatures. I didn't mind the hackneyed plots. What I minded was a ten page script with no action and no humor. Even the most dedicated role player was bored to tears after five minutes, let alone the idiot dewds looking up Firiona's dress. What I minded most of all was the way EQ treats the story supposedly behind the game. Firiona was not a regular character. She was like that couch in your grandmother's living room, the one that if you dare sit on, brings a shriek of "Don't sit there, it's for COMPANY." What the fuck am I, cat food? Perhaps if the players had been tossed more than the occasional bone, quests would have been policed by the players. As it was, so few people were involved in the story, every quest was an exercise in patience and self control, trying not to kill players who had just lost interest in the tale. (It doesn't help when Chapter 3 is in Freeport, Chapter 4 in Permafrost, and the guides never got around to Chapters 1 and 2 because there weren't enough guides logged in at the appointed time.)There is simply no sense of a permeating story in EQ, because no one has written one worth reading.</p>
<p>Did you ever notice how immediately following a "story" quest, there would be a "kill the players" quest? After spending two hours chasing down players who never stopped casting their noisiest spells and shouting VER@NT SUXS, after two hours of enduring the worst fantasy writing possible.... well, being a giant zombie screeching I AM THE DREAD PIRATE ROBERTS AND I AM HERE FOR YOUR SOUL just sounds like fun. If you wonder if the zombie in question typed /who all quest-disrupting asshole before zoning in to make like the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man, well, just because you're paranoid doesn't mean someone isn't out to get you. Hindsight being 20/20 and all, I think some blame goes to Verant for creating "storylines" as fake and shallow as a lick 'n' stick tattoo.</p>
<p>I've been rambling on, I guess I need a point. If you ever read a fantasy novel, or watched a role playing performance, and thought you could do better - you probably can. It's gotta be better than the crap we put up with now.</p>
