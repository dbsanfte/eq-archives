<p class="update">WEEKLY UPDATE - 2/27/01</p>
<p>So, what could possibly go wrong with a mouse's right button? I hardly use the damn thing. I could see losing the left button, what with my Minesweeper addiction, but really, the right button isn't used except for JBoots and the Mask of the Deceiver. And epics, but we, um, already covered that. Fortunately, I never throw out anything, including mice that went swimming in Dr. Pepper, so a broken mouse was not the crisis it could have been. Nothing like a wet rag when you're really desperate for a replacement mouse.</p>
<p>While most people agreed with Ronnie's opinion on the new cleric rules, I'd like to present a dissenting opinion that was equally well considered, from Jason: "While this is a large change late in the game, it still seems likely that it only substantially affects the kinds of encounters players have been experiencing for the last year or even less (Kunark and Velious). Also, making large changes to the game is not something that Verant should avoid… this game has been going for 2 years, and will likely continue for at least one more. How many other games have people played for that long before getting bored out of their skulls? Have you ever played Civ 2? I loved that game. Played it to death until I finally figured out the way to beat it 90% of the time… you win because you have built in advantages over the AI. It wastes resources, and hasn't got a clue about what your strategy is. This is why Verant needed to make this change. Why should a supposedly intelligent boss mob not understand how important it is to kill the healers? If the only way they had to make mobs tough was to cheat, i.e. make them hit ridiculously hard, AE lifetaps, ultra-high resistance, etc., then it would be a boring game, and we wouldn't be here arguing about it 2 years after release. God forbid they find a way to make the game hard by using our own strategies against us."</p>
<p>Jason's point is valid because EQ is substantially more than a MUDD - if the Vision is in fact to make an evolving world. Personally, I usually picture the original vision as "Hey, wouldn't it be cool to make a MUDD with like, graphics?" (Deep inhalation) "Dude, that's so… cosmic." (Munching noises) "Totally."</p>
<p>New rambling rant to your right, and this one is thanks to Yiktopo. Okay, I love you lady, buh bye.</p>
