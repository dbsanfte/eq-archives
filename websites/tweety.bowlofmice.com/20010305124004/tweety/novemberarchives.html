<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE: 11/29/00 - Dog Ass Syndrome</p>
<p><b>My house does not have cat ass syndrome, but it does have dog ass syndrome. The worst thing about it is that I can't make it go away. Instead of writing new chunks of wit and wisdom, today I went around vacuuming, dusting, spraying floral smelling shit that's going to get my ass kicked by the roommates, and lighting candles. It hasn't made a rat's ass worth of difference. Or, I should say, a dog's ass.</b></p>
<p>It's not because of gaming, though, it's because we have a pack of four footed beasties that like to roll in the back yard and play catch with dead squirrels. Yes, dogs play catch with each other, just not very well. I'll just step briefly away from games for a second and beg those of you thinking about getting a puppy to GO TO THE POUND, NOT A PET STORE. You do NOT need to pay a thousand bucks for a purebred animal. Members of the pack in the House of Tweety include a purebred Rottweiler and a purebred beagle. The beagle was originally sold in a pet store for 350 bucks, as a present from a husband to a wife. They promptly divorced four months later, and the dog went to the pound. All the animals in my house were days away from being put to sleep. If you want to join me in never being able to wear black slacks again without people laughing at you, please adopt a furry critter and save its life. Please don't have "Santa" bring the animal, though, Christmas morning is too much excitement for an animal in a new environment.</p>
<p>New section below! "Overheard In The Game" are quotes you heard in whatever your game is that cracked your ass up. No long stories, please, but feel free to send quotes with the context that made it funny my way.</p>
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE: 11/28/00 - Fan Mail
<p><b>Where am I, and why am I listening to the Styx Greatest Hits album?</b></p>
<p>That was your random thought for the day, but it was no more random than some of the fan mail I'm getting lately. "Yo Tweets, I like your shit, but I think you should post a pic because dude, I totally think you're a man." My personal favorite was "You might be a cock, but you do rock =)." Bear in mind the last comment is taken out of context, I couldn't tell if the gentleman was calling me a cock or saying I rocked, so like the total fucking dumbass I so often am, I wrote to ask him. Thanks, I think. Y'all, seriously, please go get some fresh air. And people wonder why I'm afraid to go to conventions and admit I'm Tweety.</p>
<p>Many of you are writing to ask if I am back on the Qrack. May I remind you yet again that I was banned from the Soviet-run Skinner Box of Satan (that's SSBS for those of you still playing and still obsessed with those goddamed acronyms). Any normal person would be too afraid to try to slip into the gaping back door and play again. I think the Stepford Children who cheerlead on Whineplay would tie me to a tree in Nek Forest and flay the flesh from my living body if they found me playing again. Oh, wait, we don't have icky imagery and gory plotlines in EQ - The Family Game.</p>
<p>Today's rant (Run) is a look at the evolution of a player in EQ. Some people don't go through all the levels, and some people head straight from normal to psychotic in one level. Oh, and don't worry, no big words or deep thoughts. I was shooting for "entertaining." My REAL favorite fan letter says "you made me spew soda from my nose all over my keyboard today." I don't think I got my head from the clouds all day.</p>
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE: 11/25/00 - Happy Turkey Day
<p><b>Everyone having a good Thanksgiving weekend? I haven't bothered to update, just because I figured not too many of you were at work the last couple of days. And let's face it, no one reads my site because I'm the Shakespeare of gaming. You read my site because it's more acceptable than downloading porn at the office.</b>
<p>According to my hit counter, however, there are plenty of you who would rather surf the web and hit your bookmarked sites than spend time in the bosoms of your lovely families. I understand, believe me - my parents moved overseas when I was in college, and it's the best thing that ever happened to our relationship. Nothing like the distance of an entire hemisphere to finally seal the criticizing lips! No more driving across half a continent to eat turkey prepared by a woman who can only cope with stir fry! No more patented after meal pouting! No more bickering, bitching, and comments about my bangs being in my eyes! I can spend the entire day on the computer in sweatpants and a T-shirt that has "Absolut Bitch" printed on it!</p>
<p>So, of course, I took this freedom from oppressive family holidays and drove to one of my best friend's houses, where I snarfed leftover turkey, some of that scary bean casserole everyone feels compelled to make at Thanksgiving, and basked in the warm glow of people taking pot shots at absent relatives. And my friend and I did not once mention Everquest.</p>
<p>Enjoy the rest of your holiday weekend, gang.</p>   
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE: 11/22/00 - The Guide of Veeshan's Peak
<p><b>I wanted to post yesterday, about the guide who went bananas on the TT server. I wanted to, I really did. But what's the point in posting if the sum total of your reaction is:</b></p>
<p>BWHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!</p>
<p>Put the unlicensed handguns away, it's not that I don't feel sorry for the <b>innocent</b> victims. There were probably several harmless bystanders who got whooshed into a really BIG dragon's ass, and those people didn't deserve to lose the three weeks that it took them to earn their four lousy pixels of experience. I hope that Verant has as promised checked the logs and restored all the folks involved to their previous levels of exp. If they don't, well, don't bother calling the paramedics because I sure won't have a heart attack over the shock of Verant being too pathetic to touch their testicles AND provide customer service.</p>
<p>Remember my little rant entitled "Try Being a Guide"? The ONLY reason I typed a rant instead of hauling some d00ds into VP was because I'm just a big mush ball at heart. I kept thinking that maybe Mr. 58th Level Douchebag had just had a bad day when he was ripping into me. Maybe he didn't really MEAN to call me names and tell me how stupid I was. Remember, I'm the big fan of thinking of the fellow behind the keyboard when it comes to actual interaction - I try to always keep in mind that I don't know the kind of day the other guy is having.</p>
<p>I was also afraid that if I tried that summoning trick, I'd accidentally summon "Pimps," who hadn't ever talked to me, instead of "Pimpz," the intended recipient. Mistakes like that happen, and I didn't want to make one.</p>
<p>But I'll bet you a million dollars that at least half the people still picking dragon teeth out of their asses were the sort of people who said, "fuk you d00d, Ive done this 4 ever, its not an xpl0it" and "wtf u mean u wont rezz me, it's a fucking bug, you stupid twat."</p>
<p>Oh, and yes, it does sound EXACTLY like a normal "event," except that the guide should have convinced someone to let him become a dragon to prevent the players from losing exp (clue alert - a guide-controlled NPC NEVER takes experience from you when he kills you). That's what good little guides do when they want to kill players.</p>
<p>Today's rant - trade skills! To the right.</p>
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE: 11/20/00 - Assorted bits</p>
<p><b>Well, when I posted last week to say there was an article at Gamers.com and Lum's with all the details, it was because I had received an email saying a story would be up shortly. The updates are up now, so head over to Lum-Lum and follow the link from there to the article in which all is made clear. Why, yes, I AM too lazy to put in the links myself.</b></p>
<p>Another reader who has a personal stake in the whole colorblind issue suggested that I alert everyone to the <a href=http://www.opera.com><span class="greenLink">Opera Web Browser</span></a>, which allows you to set your own colors for site viewing.</p>
<p>Dawn is not dead! Or so says the email sent to all their would be beta testers. Still wondering how the hell they think they can run a beta at the same time Shadowbane does, considering the extra two years of actual game development that Wolfpack has accomplished.</p>
<p>It's incredibly freaky to go to the Best of the Best competitions (an EQ tournament), sit among the spectators, and watch the battles. The people around you are discussing the contestants, with the kind of knowledgeable detail previously reserved for football and horseracing. If you have a beer when you watch, it's even more creepy. Dunno, I was just disturbed at myself for missing a real spectator event in favor of watching a fake one.</p>
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE: 11/17/00 - Risen from the dead</p>
<p><b>How nice. "Sheyla," both the person and the Sheyla v. 2, are alive and kicking. Someone I trust spoke with Sheyla v. 1's MOTHER. I am, select one:</b></p>
<p>Glad that no one is dead.</p>
<p>Disgusted that someone would play games like this.</p>
<p>Hoping this person gets help.</p>
<p>Hoping that people hang on to whatever insight into themselves that they gained through this mess.</p>
<p>All of the above.</p>
<p>And, in the same spirit that made your mother kick your ass when you ran away from home and made her worry, I would really like to wring someone's neck right about now.</p>
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE: 11/16/00 - The patch</p>
<p><b>I appreciate all of the notes sent to me in the last few days. Y'all really are wonderful.</b></p>
<p>So! How about that patch message and assorted floating hunks of love emerging from our favorite company? I can just see Abashi counseling his replacement - "Don't worry, son, it'll be ugly for a day, but we have a SECRET WEAPON. In one day we are releasing a patch that will make light sources not work, and people with cheap graphics cards see every face as though it were smooshed like a pug puppy! They will totally forget this unpleasantness in favor of griping about the patch!"</p>
<p>In Verant's defense, the patch also did some great things. I have to say, ten slot hot button screens are great when you get used to them. The "look" of the game on top of the line machines is pretty nifty. And, when you think about it, ol' Verant is demonstrating some foresight. Obviously, you'll need to have a better machine than perhaps the one you were using in order to handle Velious. By making everyone upgrade NOW, everyone who wants to play SoV will have their personal technical issues solved before the magic moment.</p>
<p>The game is aging, no doubt about it. You aren't likely to meet too many true newbies on a server that's been around for awhile. So who are the low levels? Head to your right. And, yeah, I know that list is getting insane, I'm probably going to revamp the way the rants are archived. When I designed the site I figured I'd be out of shit to bitch about around rant #10. Oh, but I was wrong.</p> 
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE: 11/15/00 - Thought</p>
<p>Please bear in mind that when I posted my update yesterday, I was still unsure if the situation was a hoax or not. Let me repeat, I do not believe that Verant, EQ, or roleplaying was responsible for the death of a guide and player. Suicide is never the result of a single factor. Neither is depression.</p>
<p>How Verant handles the way they confirm the identity of players is an issue that must be dealt with. This is not the test case for it. Too many people are already claiming that Verant's irresponsibility (in not checking identity, before they included the post on an EZ board as a reason in her termination letter) killed this child. That is not what happened. SHE was hurt, and she was hurting.</p>
<p>To those of you who still believe this is a hoax - I hope it is, too. Even if it is, I implore you to think about how much pain she is in, to fake something of this magnitude. Think of how badly she wants to know she's loved. Think about how little affection she gets if she needs all this to prove her value to herself.</p>
<p>To those who believe it's real, go ahead and read the commentary for the day. (Someone)</p>
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE: 11/14/00 - Rumors</p>
<p>There's a rumor going around about a girl who killed herself, with the last straw being her dismissal from the guide program - due to a post someone faked using her guide name.</p>
<p>The two issues under discussion are separate. One, Verant yet again threw out someone based on a message board post without checking to see if the person posting was who they said they were. Two, a lonely little girl killed herself because all she wanted in life was to be a part of the EQ world. Everyone seems to be running off at the mouth saying either that Verant is at fault for her death (untrue) or that Verant did nothing in firing her based on a message post (also untrue).</p>
<p>People are saying the last because they don't want to blame Verant for the incident. I understand that. If this girl did in fact kill herself, it is in no way the fault of Everquest or the people who make the game. However, Verant MUST find a better way to determine that a person who claims to be someone on a message board is in fact the person they claim to be.</p>
<p>I would also like to point out that we don't know for certain if this is entirely fact just yet. Let's hold off on the tears until we know for a fact we should be crying. If any of you who saw my little love note on Lum's board think my wait and see attitude is at odds with my post, you should know that what pissed me off was a snooty attitude towards human life in general.</p>
<p><b>Late afternoon, 11/14:</b> I got confirmation from several sources. It seems that it really happened. I have no words, right now, guess I'll post some tomorrow.</p>
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE: 11/13/00 - Color blindness, dood analysis</p>
<p>The mailbox was humming recently, and all kinds of goodies came in. Just in case you haven't been following this site from its inception, I feel the need to repeat a couple things: A) I love you all, but I don't open attachments from people I've never met. I'm sure you're good people, but at least three of you have sent me viruses, and I believe one of you did it on purpose. 2) I get from 20 - 150 messages a week, and it might take me between two seconds to two weeks to get back to you, if I do. I read it all, but please to not spam the Tweety asking if she read your note. I appreciate the love, though. III) There is no three.</p>
<p>First, we have a note from Arios Truthseeker, who had to have been a psych major in college. He has analyzed the d00d to within an inch of its pitiful little existence, and it blows my theory (which is "some people are just assholes") all to hell. <a href=" http://www.circleoftruth.org/d00dessay.html"> Check it out!</a></p>
<p>Five different readers, or one reader with a severe split personality, suggested I check out the George Martin series of books. So I will.</p>
<p>Finally, a note from John shared with me mucho useful information about color blindness, and it seems that my site can't be read by anyone with red/green color issues. Starting today, all rants will have a link at the top that you can follow to a yellow, larger print version. Of course, if you can't read this you won't know I did it…<p>
<p>New rant to your right; more of a "how-to" than a rant. (How To Get Stuff)</p>
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE: 11/10/00 - Ass monkey clarification</p>
<p>Merciful jackrabbits, here I was expecting email from those scary non-existent guilds, and instead I hear from every lunatic who ever bombed an abortion clinic. Thank god for readers like Jeff, who wrote to me with a thoughtful commentary on his personal opinions complete with logic and common sense.</p>
<p>Calm your damn nerves, people. On my board, I found myself trying to define "ass monkey." Here it is, for those of you who would rather drop dead than read a bulletin board. Someone who would kill to demonstrate their love for human life is a scumbag. Someone who believes <i>they and they alone</i> understand God is an idiot. Someone who tries to enforce their OPINION and POINT OF VIEW as a law for everyone else to live by is an ass monkey.</p>
<p>The other side: Someone who personally finds peace and happiness believing Jesus is their savior is a Christian. Someone who believes abortion is wrong and wouldn't ever have one or ask a female partner to have one is pro-life. A person can believe that abortion is wrong, and still defend another person's right to make their own decision, by the way. Pro-choice and pro-life are not mutually exclusive.</p>
<p>I have a great deal of respect for people who have quietly considered their values, their morals, and their beliefs, and used that tripod to build a personal opinion that they then stand by and defend. I have many, many readers who violently disagree with me on any number of subjects, and write to me with fabulous arguments of the highest intellectual caliber. I may still disagree, but I can step back from the debate and say, "That person is one smart cookie, and he/she/it has earned my respect, if not my agreement." You cannot, however, ask me to respect people whose total argument is "God said so, and you're an idiot if you disagree." Really? What if God told ME something different? Argue that one, Bubba.</p>
<p>Does that clear anything up? Good. I hereby declare the topic closed as far as this website is concerned. It's my fault for even mentioning it on a gaming site, mea culpa. You may take it to the boards, but if your sole reason for posting to the board is the abortion debate, people will laugh at you. I am happy to discuss any topic over email - and that means "discussion," not browbeating. Enough of you have written to me by now (and discovered that I'm happy to listen to other points of view one on one) that you shouldn't be surprised. If you wish to state your opinion in the same manner as I have done, please set up your own damn website and send me the link.</p>
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE: 11/8/00 - We elected who? Planned Parenthood anecdote</p>
<p>Sigh. Goddamit. George Bush needs to call up Ralph Nader and say, "Hey, good buddy! You sure delivered. Here's the first installment of that lifetime supply of blow jobs I promised you." Gore had the election wrapped up like a mummy if only HALF of Nader's votes had gone his way. One of the idiot savants doing political commentary pointed out last night that Nader would be happy with a Bush win, because membership in environmental groups always skyrockets under right-wing administrations. Swell. Meanwhile, say hello to Artic drilling and a shackled EPA! Let's not even talk about gay rights and my right to control my own body! Yay, team!</p>
<p>Which leads me to a little anecdote. I went to Planned Parenthood, because I don't wish to give birth while I have no health insurance or husband, and man oh man, do they sell cheap pills. The building had no sign in front. The actual office was in the middle of the building, also unmarked. The hallway was filled with security cameras, and before I could be let in I had to announce my name and appointment time through an intercom. Once inside, I showed a picture ID to a receptionist sitting behind a bulletproof window. I got buzzed in through another door, and after my examination I waited for some test results in a room with a frosted. shatterproof window. When I asked why, I was told the room was where women recovered after having abortions. Because, you know, the sanctity of life is so important that people will kill you for having an abortion. All this in an era with a liberal president. What happens when the born again ass monkeys take over?</p>
<p>Today's totally unrelated rant is about guilds that don't exist forming up for a game that doesn't exist so they can learn to work together before anything exists to work in. (The Biggest Chimp in the Tree)</p>
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE: 11/6/00 - Crashing server memories</p>
<p>When you can't get a decent net connection, it's hard to tell if Everquest crashing is because of YOU or THEM. My poor roommates just spent a few nights howling in anguish at about ten in the evening, because they'd lag out and crash every few minutes. Our plain old ISDN never gave us attitude, but our big fancy DSL service couldn't cope with all three of us hitting the internet on one game or another.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, dear ol' Verant wouldn't dream of admitting that lag exists because of THEIR equipment. Since they don't admit it when it's obviously their fault, the customer base tends to be paranoid and assume it's ALWAYS Verant's fault.</p>
<p>Why am I mentioning this? Because I have absolutely no news to mention here, and this is the intro to my little stroll down memory lane. When I was guiding, I KNEW when it was Verant's fault, because people would hit the panic buttons and beg all guides to log in and commence the rezzing/investigating frenzy that always results from a legitimate server crash. If Verant bleeds, the sharks go mad. (Servers are Down)</p>   
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE: 11/5/00 - Learn some English already</p>
<p>Unbelievable. All my ranting about Verant being out of touch customer dissing money grubbing amateur losers who couldn't compete with a real business if Wall Street were the Paralympics turns out to be unfair. Well, not really, Verant is all of those things, but it turns out they suck equally when compared to any internet service provider.</p>
<p>DSL on the east coast is, um, broken. It's been broken since Halloween. So, my household decided to go back to ISDN for the time being. The account is active, the ISDN phone line still works, the computers are all virus free - so why doesn't it work? Let's call Verizon for the twentieth time today! Bear in mind that this company SOLD US THE ISDN MODEM. We didn't order it from a third party, we bought it directly from the company. So why did they tell us that they can't offer technical support for this product? Why couldn't they have included that tidbit of information with the manual that came with the modem? And how come when we called twelve hours later, we found someone who could in fact help us? And Jesus Henrietta Christ, why don't the front line help desk personnel speak English? I don't mean they got into techie speak, I mean the guy who we talked to first was from Lebanon and didn't speak any English. Who moves here with the idea that they don't need to speak the primary language? For that matter, what kind of asshole HIRES a HELP DESK EMPLOYEE who can't talk to the customers?</p>
<p>I'm proud of the United States. I believe this country is stronger for its citizens hailing from other cultures. I believe we should return to a "give us your tired, your poor, etc" mindset, because that's the thinking that made this a great nation. And I also believe that without a common language, this country becomes a Balkanized "my minority is more downtrodden than yours" mass of whining. Learn some fucking English before you start earning Social Security, assholes.</p>   
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE: 11/3/00 - EQ's Halloween event</p>
<p>Announcing the death of customer service was premature; there is no pulse, but there are occasional signs of brain activity. When I called Verizon to ask why my DSL was slower than dialup, I got a very nice boy who remained patient and friendly despite my overwhelming ignorance. Of course, he turned out to be an EQ player… we're everywhere…</p>
<p>Sometimes, the email y'all send me just makes me laugh. Check out Nick's report of the EQ Halloween Extravaganza: "It's the amazingly static theme of 'Godzilla in Greater Fay'.  Wow!! While they couldn't actually use Godzilla because of copyright issues, they replaced the 'monster gone amok' with a sea serpent from Timorous Deep in Lake of Ill Omen and Werewolves in WC.  Guess what happened next? Yea, corpses galore, low, mid, and high level ones.  I'm sorry, these were the necessary 'victims' that had the dubious honor of being 'saved' in the Verant storyline.  The heroes? HA!!! You'll never guess... Just one hero needed.. No uberguild needed either.  You've been slain by this hero a few times, I'm sure.  It's the famous Youvebeen Dis'Connected hero, herald of the Zone Crash guild. Yep, indiscriminate killer of pcs and npcs, with his AE spell that affects all either zone-wise or server-wise.  Hell-o-Verant!! Ban-or-bear-it!! Pay us to test our next beta product!!"</p>
<p>I would have uploaded a rant today, but I have spent the last six hours getting hysterical over the computer freezing up every time I try to copy and paste. Or play solitaire. Or send email. I'm going to go drink a beer. The message for today is BUY A VIRUS REMOVER PROGRAM.</p>   
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE: 11/1/00 - DSL connection</p>
<p>I have reached the conclusion that customer service is officially dead in the US. </p>
<p>I live in a household that REALLY likes computer games. My criteria for a new computer, when I bought one last year, was entirely based on system requirements for EQ. (Not the ones listed on the BOX, duh, the ones other players said were required.) We possess big monitors, zippy graphics cards, spiffy speakers, the works. A choice between a new network card and groceries is easy. We wired the whole mess into a network in the basement so we can holler instructions across the room to each other no matter what we're playing. We even decided to switch from ISDN to DSL strictly for the connection speed. Well, and so one guy can play Tribes while I futz around with my website - he was lagging out every time I downloaded something.</p>
<p>The switch to DSL is why you've not heard me chirp in a few days. All I have to say to those Verizon motherfuckers is this: When I've been sitting on hold for over an hour, I don't want to hear "I can't help you." All I want to hear is "How hard would you like me to apply my tongue to your genital region? A light flicking movement, or hard thrusts?"</p>
<p>Today's rambling, over to your right, has NOTHING to do with the above. See you later. (Getting Taken In)</p>
