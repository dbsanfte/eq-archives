<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE - 1/31/01</p>
<p>Okay, I'm back. The hordes didn't actually leave my house until mid afternoon Monday. ("Gosh, we're having so much fun, let's sleep on the FLOOR for three days!") That long rambling piece on the Corpnews site? Let me give you the background. I went out to dinner with four Lum The Mad writers, three Corpnews writers, and one random person. Afterwards, one Lum writer, the Corpnews writers, and the random person went back to my house and snarfed enough liquor to knock over a rhino. At about four in the morning, we decided to make a travel journal to go with the pictures we were taking. The decision to post that mess was made after leaving the land of liquor and traveling through the mountains of hard cider. Oh, and the random person got hired to write for Lum the Mad, Inc. If I could only make one observation, it would be that everyone was surprisingly attractive and personable for a bunch of self-proclaimed internet geeks.
<p>For those of you who are now inspired to have your own real life gathering of online friends - as completely random as this weekend was, bear in mind that some basic safety precautions were taken. We gathered in a large group. No matter how much you love your best friend from EQ, you DO NOT KNOW that person. If you aren't gathering in a big pack of idiots, meet in public first. Tell someone where you are going. Do not give out your address until you have met the person. Hide all mementos of your early childhood before you allow people into your home, because pictures of you at age eight might as well have a homing beacon on them.
<p>No rant today, but I got one cooking for tomorrow. Y'all be good, now.   
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE - 1/26/01</p>
<p>Sigh. You'd think I'd learn not to use sarcasm with Whineplay readers. To paraphrase an old cliché, it's like using sarcasm with a pig. You're just going to get dirty and confuse the pig. Grollerdabard, buddy, I wasn't talking to you in my previous post. See, NOW you're famous. Love ya, mean it. Gonna have to reiterate a previous comment - I don't actively read Whineplay. I am utterly dependent on y'all, my alert readers, to send me links when something interesting is going on. Of course, it's Whineplay, so "interesting" is directly related to how much hard liquor I've ingested.
<p>Ay yi yi, the Bird is flipping out today. Some of the guys from The Corporation said "ROAD TRIP" and are coming down to visit me. Of course, IRC being what it is, the word was spread to some of the Lum the Mad writers, and hopefully they will be joining us as well in our quest to get arrested in the Nation's Capital. The nation being the United States, for those of you just tuning in. I was happy as a clam, typing away, figuring out the logistics of this gathering, and then it struck me. HOLY SHIT I'M A FUCKING GEEK. I'm going to spend Saturday with people I know from online. No, that's not the only reason I'm flipping. People are going to see what I look like in real life. Someone might bring a camera and my picture will wind up on the net. Gah. I don't like people. Why else would I have a rant site? Because people are so damn nifty I want to express my love for them? Gah, I said. Too late to back out now. If you're out and about in DC this weekend, I'll be the one on top of the elephant in the Natural History museum screeching "GET BACK! I'M ARMED!"
<p>New content for the day is another Brief Aside update. I'm too busy removing the dog ass and cigarette smell from my house so that my (GEEK ALERT) online friends don't think I'm yucky to write a new rant.   
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE - 1/24/01</p>
<p>ROFL. Alert reader Dave sent me a link to Whineplay, where my name was being taken in vain. Some goober noticed me saying one sentence on Verant had finally read their own EULA and taken steps to end Ebay loving, and turned it into his own little rant. However, he wrote "thx Tweety" at the top. Since it is a documented fact that the most avid Whineplay aficionados rarely read my site, "Tweety is a moron" posts began to fly, since the assumption was I had said those things. Hey! Weenies! Try reading what I write before you comment!
<p>I found it hilarious, and enjoyed the witty repartee no end. The comment that really, really hurt me was the observation that what I write isn't exactly earthshaking. Something about how I only aim for easy targets. OH MY GOD, I HAVE BEEN FOUND OUT. Someone finally noticed I wasn't a reporter, and this site consists solely of amusing short essays designed to entertain. Sweet baby Jesus, however will I sleep at night.
<p>I didn't read the whole thread. Reading Whineplay is like eating arsenic-flavored icing. Three or four spoonfuls are yummy, but after awhile the sugar rush makes you shake and then you keel over from the effects of the poison.
<p>Rant's to your right, now with 20% less weight and substance.
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE - 1/22/01</p>
<p>What is superlative? Should a "best" rating or award connotate the best that a particular category has to offer, or does it represent the thing that has the least wrong with it? Does something get nominated for a prize because it's popular or because it has value?
<p>I'm not talking about EQ, either, I'm talking about the goddamn Golden Globe awards. I didn't pay any attention to them at all, but since Netscape so kindly offered me a nice link to a list of the nominees and the winners this morning, I clicked it. Jessica Alba was the only one nominated for an acting award from Dark Angel? What? Add it as a sign of the impending apocalypse, kids. She's the only one on that show who CAN'T act. I know I said earlier that she was getting better, and she is - now I only wince once or so every episode. She still can't act! We watch because she's like, hot and stuff. She kicks ass. Now, Michael Weatherly, he can act. And he's REALLY hot. But, it seems that the Fox network's official Hype Machine could only kick in for one cast member.
<p>Y'all do realize how entertainment products win awards, right? This includes sports figures, like the candidates for the Heisman Trophy. The sponsoring organization, be it a college or a movie studio, sends video clips and press kits to anyone who might be voting. It's called awareness building. But just as reporters tend to get their news from press releases because it's easier, so do award voters choose the candidate placed in front of them like a plate of food at a restaurant. Because thinking for yourself is work.
<p>Mutter. Think I'm ranted out, I'll catch you tomorrow. If you want some comedy, my other website interviewed Lum the Mad, and it should be going up sometime today.
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE - 1/19/01</p>
<p>Y'all ever have days where all you want is to get on a plane and go somewhere? Doesn't matter a rat's ass WHERE, you just want to go? I have a dim memory of being twenty, hanging out with two friends, and hopping into a two door Honda and spending 18 hours driving to Ft. Myers, Florida. BECAUSE WE COULD. We didn't even stop long enough to go to the ATM. I think we were fours hours down the road when the girl driving discovered that neither me nor the other passenger knew how to drive stick shift. Man, she was pissed. I still have my Keds from the trip. Every time something funny happened, I wrote the catchphrase on the canvas.</p>
<p>Now we don't do that stuff anymore. BECAUSE WE'RE MATURE. Who will feed the dog? We can't afford it! I don't know if I can get out of this office party! My significant other wants to go too! My significant other wants me to stay home this weekend! My plants need watering! My back hurts when I ride in the back seat! WAH WAH WAH.</p>
<p>Excuse me, this update must end now, I have to go water my plants, let in the dog, and wish I was on a plane. New rant's to the right, like it always is. Have a good weekend, gang.</p>
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE - 1/18/01</p>
<p>What an odd, odd week in Tweety land. Lum went into temporary-and-possibly-permanent retirement, EQ decided to read their own EULA and ask Ebay to stop facilitating the sale of EQ pixels, I figured out how to use IRC, and Ashcroft swore he wouldn't challenge Roe vs. Wade. Mama never told me there'd be days like these.
<p>I'd write some sappy farewell to Lummy, but what the three hundred people posting poetry are missing is that he's NOT DEAD, he's job hunting. Also, the site is not dead, he's just stepping back from it. In lieu of a eulogy, let's just say he is the source from whom many of us steal, and one of the funniest people ever to spew forth on this glorious never-never land of the internet. Also one hell of a nice guy, even if his MMOG gaming skillz are not as L33T as mine. (/em scurries away giggling madly). To give some idea just how far the whole Lum The Mad phenomenon has come, I give you this quote from April 1999 from the original Lum page: <I>"Another reader asked if I was going to put up a message base. Like I care what you pinheads think! There's already 4,000 message bases for UO (all of which Designer Dragon posts on) so go play there. This is MY yard."</I> Uh huh. I, and the others in the Nest of Freaks, wish him luck however much we wish he would stay.
<p>New section to peruse, for those of you with short attention spans, called "The Brief Aside." I am not the author, I was just amused enough to grant it a new home. It existed for years on a roleplaying message board. Buzz me, let me know what you think.
<p>New rant tomorrow, be good, y'all.   
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE - 1/16/01</p>
<p>In vino, veritas, said the sage, most likely because the putz was too blasted to remember how to say "In wine there is much giggling and acting like a moron" in Latin. One of the great joys of working from home is that when an old friend comes in from out of town, you are free to say, "Why yes, I will have another glass of wine" on a Monday night. 
<p>Of course, it is now Tuesday morning, and the little voice in my head is saying, "Why no, you are no longer a twenty year old who can snarf wine and still greet the morning sun with a fresh happy face. Not anymore you aren't. HA HA." Not that I am in anyway advocating drinking if you are under 21. Because you know, here in the US, if you get arrested for drinking when you're over 18 but under 21, you'll be charged as an adult for drinking when you aren't one.
<p>So, anyway, the mail bag is full again. Some of you are getting your britches in a bunch because I haven't personally answered your emails. Please calm down. I haven't answered my MOTHER'S emails in a month, you are not special. I read every single one of them, however, so rest assured you aren't screaming down a well.
<p>One email in particular tickled me - a reader wrote to ask why I've written no rant about the way people mistreat the one perfect class, the monk. Good question! I think I'll go do that now! Head over to your right and check it out, and props to "Kirthasa" for the inspiration.
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE - 1/11/01</p>
<p>Question: Gee, Tweety, where do you get your ideas for rants? Answer: You people. I read email, check the boards, surf the web, and listen to my roommates complain. Righteous indignation is a way of life, and not necessarily limited to EQ.
<p>I got some sad news from a GM - seems he and some others got fired for asking to be treated nicely by George Scotto. If you're looking for some gossip, hit up <a href="http://www.savethegms.com">his web site</a> and check it out.
<p>Nyeh, it's a slow day in Tweety land, so that's it for the update. The rant (with apologies to Bertrand Russell) is to your right. See ya.   
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE - 1/10/01</p>
<p>My fingers are typed to the bone, kids, I just finished a massive article for the Corporation on Waggaworld, the newest entry into the MMORPG company competition. Go read it or something, it sounds like something new to talk about anyway.and due to it, I have no rant for y'all.
<p>Regarding the fishtank described in my last update, it was my fault because everything is my fault. Seriously, I just walked past the damn thing. If you ever tried to keep a salt water tank alive, you know what a bitch it is to get everything balanced. The least little thing goes out of whack, the tank looks like shit and/or you have dead fifteen dollar fish.
<p>I'm crawling back into my hole with 2300 80s music MP3s to keep me company, check you later. 
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE - 1/8/01</p>
<p>Do not, I repeat do not, under any circumstances read feminist literature (<u>Women Who Run With Wolves</u>, if you care) and then turn around and immediately watch an old Dirty Harry movie. The one where he gets a female partner who he hates who gets killed at Alcatraz after which Dirty Harry blows up a bunch of Dirty Hippies. Two completely different cultural paradigms. Oh, fuck, I just used "paradigm" in a sentence. I quit a really well-paying job so I could STOP using paradigm in sentences.
<p>Another thing I just added to my "do not ever" list is go near a salt water aquarium. One of the roommates has this gorgeous reef tank, with all these pretty fish. I walked by the tank on my way to the coat closet. I walked back and the water had turned this milky cloudy color. I have just been informed that it is my fault.
<p>Last thought before I get to the rant - you know, one more interviewer asks me to take a piss test, I swear to all the small gods of cheese crackers, I'm going to pop a squat RIGHT ON THE INTERVIEWER'S CARPET. Does anyone else find the whole "pee in a cup and then you can have a job writing copy for brochures" thing degrading? Not to mention what a pain in the ass it is for chicks, it's not the say and spray application boys come equipped with.
<p>Now that I've completely gone downhill for the day, I think I'll just point you to the new rant and take off. Be good, and if you can't be good, be careful.
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE - 1/5/01</p>
<p>Ay yi yi. I've been a busy bird for the last few days, so I've got nothing ready for your reading consumption, rant wise. Plenty of stuff is annoying me, mind you, but it takes a few hours to simmer a big chunk of indignation into a tasty rant stew mmm. Stewwonder if there's anything in the fridge.</p>
<p>The EQ Fan Faire Registration says you must be a current EQ account holder to register. How sad! It means I can't go hey wait a minutemy roommates are active account holders, and they're allowed to bring non-player GUESTS! I wonder if they'd be allowed to bring the notorious Tweety? I'd love to meet some folks from Verant. Rumor has it that whenever my name is mentioned, they freeze up and say things like "You don't know the whole story, there's a good reason we banned her." Whole story? The whole story is I was a player, then a guide, I went beserk, I made a website. The end! If there's more to it, I personally would love to find out the details. No one ever told me.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how exciting the event will be, really, since when you click on the "registered attendees" list, there's practically no one from my old server attending, and it's not like Erollisi Marr is a small server. They expect the event to sell out - how many spots allotted? Four hundred?</p>
<p>Ah, heck with it, I'm going to go forage in the fridge. See you later.</p>
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE - 1/3/01</p>
<p>My dog does not like being ignored. Not one bit. And me working on the computer qualifies as ignoring her. I just watched in horror as she walked in a circle around my chair, throwing up very slowly, so I could be surrounded by a ring of half digested kibble. Usually, when she starts getting sick, she alerts me with a hacking noise so I can let her outside. She knows the rules - body fluids are not okay in the house. This time I jumped up, headed for the door, and she looked at me. Looked at her handiwork. Continued to puke.</p>
<p>Totally irrelevant? Maybe. But no matter how poorly your day is going, I'll bet YOU didn't step in dog barf wearing ten dollar woolly socks.</p>
<p>Well, the warm fuzzy holiday spirit infesting Norrath didn't last long. Several loyal readers have sent me chat logs with various incidents of joy and love. (Hint for anyone else sending me chat logs - no, I won't do any expose based on a chat log, which is the world's easiest thing to fake. I believe most logs I get are accurate, but the minute I throw one up on the website I'll start getting doctored records.)</p>
<p>Is there some reason we can't master basic civility? Yes, and that reason is OTHER PEOPLE. Rant's to your right.</p>   
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE - 1/1/01</p>
<p>Happy New Year. Whee. Please, PLEASE tell me you people logged out last night and did something social. I went to a party last night, with a guest list consisting of the same people I've been partying with for five years now. I met many of them through the Virginia Tech fraternity I belonged to (yes, I said FRATERNITY, and yes, I'm a girl, it's a long dull story). I remember seeing all of these people in varying stages of undress, drunk as skunks, wearing traffic cones on their heads. (Me? Nope. Too dignified for traffic cone headwear. I was the one stapling my bra to the ceiling.) I looked around the room last night, and realized most of them had married their drunken encounter love bunnies, most of them were making ungodly amounts of money doing things to computers, and one couple had even brought their three month old daughter (they left the four year old at home with a babysitter). Oh, the horror, my friends are breeding. Worst of all, playing "I Never" is just not fun when you know the participants have done everything, and you were there for most of it.</p>
<p>Go Hokies. Woo. We beat Clemson in the Gator Bowl. What a surprise. Can we have a real bowl next year, please?</p>
<p>Whither gaming? /em peers at the horizon. /em hears crickets chirping, and not much else. /em sees a tumbleweed go by. ANY DAY NOW SOMETHING NEW TO BITCH ABOUT CAN GO GOLD. Mutter. See you kids tomorrow, I'm going to go find a mimosa.</p>
