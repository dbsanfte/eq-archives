<p>Let's define a few words, shall we?</p>
<p>NEED - This is something you MUST have in order to play the game. If you are fighting
   Naggy, you NEED fire resist gear. If you are fighting in Kedge Keep, you NEED some sort
   of waterbreathing item, buff, or potion. If you died in a plane, you NEED a rezz to get back
   in the action.</p>
<p>WANT - This is something you would like to have in order to play the game. It also defines
   something that, if you get it, will make the game play much easier for you. You WANT a
   SoW when you're on a corpse run. You WANT clarity when you're the healer in a group
   that's getting its ass kicked repeatedly. You WANT a rezz when you died at level 46.</p>
<p>NEED AND WANT ARE DIFFERENT CONCEPTS.</p>
<p>Let's define some types of players:</p>
<p>NICE PERSON: The sort of player who does drive by sowings, clarityings, and buffings.
   They neither ask for anything in return, nor do they linger to get their ego stroked by the
   recipient.</p>
<p>NORMAL PLAYER: The player who, upon reading the /auction trading sow for breeze at
   dock, and noticing that he is both at the dock and at full mana, goes to the person auctioning
   and casts clarity. This person then waits for the sow, and maybe does some cute little /bow
   or /thank.</p>
<p>ASSHOLE: This is the kind of guy who, as the only 49th level cleric on his raid, camps out
   instead of rezzing his group when they all die.</p>
<p>SAINT: The person who leaves his own group to go give SoW to the group of new players
   camping the SK birds for the first time. Or the necro who goes across three zones to cast
   Summon Corpse for some people who got in over their heads.</p>
<p>NOTICE THAT ASSHOLE IS NOT DEFINED AS SOMEONE WHO REFUSES TO
   RUN HALFWAY ACROSS A CONTINENT TO DO SOMETHING FOR A TOTAL
   STRANGER.</p>
<p>That moron filter I mentioned a few days ago become more and more of a game requirement
   every day, and when implemented it better not have a limit of twenty people. Believe it or
   not, you do not NEED a Spirit of the Wolf to play the game. Think back to your first
   character. Unless you played a race whose higher leveled players could cast it, chances are
   good you never enjoyed the benefits of having it cast upon you until you left the rats 'n' bats.
   You certainly didn't enter a zone and start spamming the crap out of it looking to get one.
   Did you know spamming a zone is something that can get you petitioned and warned? The
   reason is - you aren't the only one playing the game, and you are annoying. Some people
   need a spanking to get that idea.</p>
<p>The sense of entitlement is what really pisses me off. People seem to think that is a class
   CAN cast a spell, then they MUST cast a spell. I'm starting to think that pressing the
   CONNECT button casts a real life debuff - it lowers your IQ by 50 and your age by 15.
   Look, dimwit, quit smacking the sausage long enough to comprehend this phrase: FREE
   MARKET ECONOMY. This means if someone else has something you want, you must give
   them something equal in value in order to get it from them. Spirit of Wolf doesn't suck much
   mana from a high level player, so the price is lower than say, for a rezz. The place matters as
   well - if the caster is near you, or if you're willing to go to them, then the cost would be lower
   than it would be for someone blowing an hour just to help you out. Why is this difficult to
   grasp?</p>
<p>"NO" is an acceptable answer, my children. When you send a tell, asking for a favor, the
   other party is allowed to say no. If you continue to pester them, the other party is allowed to
   be rude to you. Asking nicely increases your odds of being helped, not guarantees it. This
   isn't your mother standing there with a cookie asking you for the magic word. Your mother
   doesn't play Everquest. And the rest of us don't give a fuck what you want.</p>
<p>What's really funny is that there are people reading this, nodding, saying things like "Right on,
   Tweety, preach on, amen..." and they are the people I'm talking about. There's one turkey
   who regularly spams my twink "Give me sow plz" over and over and over. Since I log her in
   whenever I'm waiting for my guild to get a raid geared up, I get it from him several times a
   week. What a pathetic prick you are, buddy. I'm a good twenty levels under you, and you
   have yet to thank me beyond "thx." You've never paid me, or given my patchwork wearing
   self anything. So, I stopped answering you. I wish I could ignore you, but regretfully my main
   character plays in the same zones you do, and I have to be able to hear your whiny ass
   screaming TRAIN. Giving you something you want isn't an honor or a thrill. Get a life, get a
   clue, and drop some plat on the next person who does you a favor. I would dearly love to
   identify you, but I don't feel like getting flamed just for the two second thrill of embarrassing
   an inferior being. It would be like making fun of a thalidomide baby, anyway.</p>
<p>What kind of self centered, prepubescent LOSER bitches out a shaman who won't cross an
   entire Karana just to cast SoW? Insert enchanter/clarity, cleric/rezz, necro/corpse where
   appropriate. I will never ever EVER seriously play any of those classes because of all the
   whining and bitching they have to put up with. I'm too tired to really go off on a rant here, so
   I'm putting the question to you crybaby pissant newbie bitches with no self respect: Why do
   you think your wants are more important than someone else's time?</p>
