<p>Everyone wants something for nothing, and nowhere is that attitude more prevalent than the internet. Free content, free news, free entertainment, music, gossip, games, chatrooms, and naked women shoving ears of corn in their patooties. ESPECIALLY naked women. The ride started out free, and by god, it's now our RIGHT to have this plethora of free expression. It appeals to our egalitarian little hearts - any damned fool can have a website, and have their say. (*whistles a little tune*) People who wouldn't dream of reading magazines, newspapers, or novels for free don't give a second thought to who is paying the writers who bring you web content.</p>
<p>The pony ride is ending, though, despite all the business models scribbled on whiteboards by chimpanzees in their 200 dollar Nikes and 80 dollar sweatshirts and 150 dollar khakis that were "distressed" at the factory for the de rigeur casual look. What the fuck is up with that? What kind of brain damage makes you spend more money on casual clothes than suits? Is there something wrong with wearing jeans you broke in yourself? Christ, I miss the 80s. When I wanted cool shredded jeans like the lead singer of Def Leppard, I took some scissors to my favorite Levis and went buck. Of course, my mother wouldn't let me leave the house wearing them, but at least I had a pair of cool jeans in my closet. But I digress.</p>
<p>Here in Northern Virginia, where the residents have always been self-absorbed cocksucking ass kissing social climbing yuppies with no concept of personal responsibility, the internet revolution found fertile ground. It took over the brains of the locals and sucked every useful brain cell out and spit them into a Starbucks MegaDecafLatte. The Washington Post recently had an article about a precious little family that is shopping at consignment shops and clipping coupons on a paltry NINETY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. Oh, GOSH. Ninety grand is such a PITTANCE. Yeah, this area is expensive, I grew UP here, I think I know about comparative rent costs and so forth. I don't give a flying fuck how relatively expensive it is here, a family income a pubic hair away from six figures annually is NOT "just getting by." But I digress.</p>
<p>Everywhere I go, I hear one of the aforementioned chimps yapping on his cell phone (at fucking seven thirty in the morning on the train no less - yo, asshole, if you're reading this, I want you to know just how close to death you got this morning. I don't want to hear the voice of GOD that early, let alone your nasal whining. If you're such a big shot, what are you doing on the commuter special? Huh? I thought so. When the bag lady whose sole hobby is riding the yellow Metro line all day thinks you're a moron, maybe you should put the fucking phone away. Half the car was pretty sure you didn't actually have the phone on anyway. Penis extensions should be seen and not heard).  I hear these people clucking into their phones, talking about how the party is over. These internet businesses are like mushrooms, though - you think you've killed one, but all you did was scatter the spores everywhere so now your entire lawn is infested. Damn it, I got off topic again.</p>
<p>Although it seems clear that the dot coms are tanking more often than a troll warrior, you still find people acting as though they can run a business that doesn't actually have a product to sell. Ever watch a little kid having a major growth spurt try to run under a table? Two weeks ago, he had plenty of clearance and just charged right past. This week, though, he's a half inch taller, and he keeps whacking his skull on the edge. Depending on the skull thickness, the little guy will back up and try it again a few times, not grasping that THINGS ARE DIFFERENT NOW.</p>
<p>Why do the internet moguls act like three year olds and continue to whack their heads into the table of obviousness? Because they don't just try to sell this shit, they are the consumers of this shit as well, and they know they don't want to pay for something they've previously gotten for free. Consumers rarely know how much their goods and services actually cost to produce, so every rate increase is met with cries of "gouging!" and "profiteering!" Everyone "knows" that big companies are out to rip us poor little consumers off.</p>
<p>Damn it. I've now digressed so far I have no idea what my point was. I'll just say this: No one seems to understand that there is no free lunch. The odds are against you becoming a billionaire without actually earning the money unless you're a Kennedy. Getting rich off of banner ads that no one reads or clicks is impossible. Ten bucks a month (which, given how much people play EQ, works out to pennies per session of whack a mole) doesn't get you personal attention from a competent customer service agent. And the Wonderful Web isn't a bottomless pit of free entertainment. Unless, of course, you happen to be entertained by damned fools with websites.</p>
