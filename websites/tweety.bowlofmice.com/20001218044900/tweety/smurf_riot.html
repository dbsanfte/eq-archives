<p>Lum the Mad broke the story last night - Ultima Online volunteers are suing for back wages. It's either the dawn of a brave new world, or the end of it, depending on whom you ask.</p>
<p>I'm not reporting this tale, that's all about our buddy Lum. Go check his page for the details, I'm just going to run my mouth on the subject.</p>
<p>Worst case scenario: Game companies dismiss all their volunteers, and put up a sign saying "the trough is closed, get yer slops elsewhere." Being stuck in the gate in Permafrost, 10K damage on zoning, sticky bits of walls in Sol A and B, these are now "features" and you best make nice with a guy who can summon corpses.</p>
<p>Best case scenario: Game companies go "Aw, fucknoodles, we're gonna have to do it right the first time, because it's more cost effective to not have sticky bits and wormholes as opposed to paying people to fish out the hapless player."</p>
<p>Notice that I did not include Customer Service in either scenario.</p>
<p>Now, my web developer friend says the best case is a drug-induced hallucination. No way, no how, he says. Because the business model for all computer companies says Thou Shalt Throw Something Out Early, build a customer base, and once the demand exists, create new material that will keep the suckers pounding the pellet bar for one more treat. My pal's theory is this is the reason for such long term bugs as the sticky gate and the zone-into-lava-and-die bugs. Yes, it could be fixed. The fixing takes skill, however, and the guys with those skills are building Velious.</p>
<p>So, we're looking at the worst case scenario here, and it's not as dreadful as it first appears. At least enforcement, and who gets helped in what situation, will for the first time in game history be enforced EQUALLY ACROSS THE BOARD. No favors. No special help. No unfair advantage. You against the environment. With a little foresight on the part of Verant, it won't even hurt - just change the level on "summon corpse," knock it down to level 20 or so, and write a "summon" spell that requires the recipient to click "I accept" just like a rezz. Give the equivalent spells to clerics and paladins to spread the load out. Honestly, 9/10ths of a guide's job goes away when you knock off the petitions from people who need their corpses or selves unstuck from a bad location. Throw out Play Nice - a stupid idea to start with - and all we're left with are bugs and catching exploiters. Now Verant has a motivating factor to hire and keep good GMs, and make sure they show up for work. (Unlike the fucking disaster they inflicted on my guide server, three months with no one driving the bus, no one with any authority, etc… grumble.)</p>
<p>Now, my opinion… the Smurfs (for those of us who only play EQ and don't even think about cheating on Verant with another lover, "smurf" is what the counselors call themselves, because they all wear blue robes) have some legal legs to stand on. A for-profit business used "free" labor to conduct an essential part of their business, and indeed, would not be making such a profit without that free labor. This has been ruled illegal by no less an authority than the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>I speak from experience, these guide programs use their volunteers pretty badly, and repay them with rudeness. The internet's biggest flaw is that people with power feel permitted to treat others rudely, because there are no consequences. Michelle Butler would not feel free to be an obnoxious little chit to me (and judging from my email, a whole lot of guides and seniors, former and current; her and her husband Jeff are just PERFECT for each other) if she had to speak to us or look us in the eye. We are faceless, and disposable, bits of text to these enormous companies. The UO customer service representatives have a perfect right to do what they are doing.</p>
<p>Would I sue Verant? Hell, yes. I would sue them in two seconds - for a reinstatement of my player account, and the right to be a customer. They twisted an existing rule to ban my player account, and made up a NEW rule a week later to fully justify it. I broke the rules of the guide program, and I don't think I'm entitled to anything from the company in that respect. I want my player account back on principle.</p>
<p>Here's where I'm getting stuck about this suit for wages - I volunteered to be a guide. I did it because I wanted to help other players. I got so much from this "game" that I wanted to give something back. It's not like working for an animal shelter (although I have four rescued pound animals drooling around my desk at this minute, I might as well be a shelter worker), or reading to blind veterans. I'm not a saint. I'm a gamer with a masochistic streak. My point is I freely gave my time to the game, without thought of compensation. I don't think I would or could participate in such a lawsuit (and there will be one for EQ, I feel certain) knowing my own motivations for guiding. If I joined a class action lawsuit against Verant, it would be because I felt ignored, marginalized, and unappreciated. I suspect that these are the driving forces behind the lawsuit. It's not about back wages. It's about feeling like you're a valued part of a team, and these counselors did not feel valued. It's sad when a company is so oblivious to their players that it takes a lawsuit to get attention.</p>
<p>William Shakespeare wrote a little play called "The Tempest." Miranda, the daughter of the wizard Prospero, had been kept hidden on Prospero's island and had never seen another human being besides her father (and wizards being wizards, he was old and crusty looking). At the end of the play, when she realizes the world is just chock full of other people and most of them are way more fun to look at than dear old Dad, she clasps her hands and says "O brave new world, that has such people in it!" When I was around fourteen, I saw a production of "The Tempest," that had been directed by a true cynic. He had Miranda say that line with sarcasm, and disgust. At the time, I thought that director was a fool, a bitter old man with a half empty cup. Now, I wonder…</p>
