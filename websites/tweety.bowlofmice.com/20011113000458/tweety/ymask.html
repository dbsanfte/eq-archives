<p>Which one of the following reminds you of someone you know?</p>
<p>Don't hate me because I was mean to you in the game. I'm a really nice person in real life. I'm kind to animals, I lead a Scout troop, and I rescue earthworms after rainstorms. I carry packages for pregnant women, I hold doors open, and I help old people cross the street. I never honk my horn, tap bumpers, make rude gestures, or yell at my cat. All my neighbors give me their spare house keys so I can water their plants and feed their fish when they leave town. I don't cuss, spit, or belch. I'm a hell of a human, frankly, so please try to understand - when I train you, when I block narrow passageways and cackle when you die, when I lie about paying you for the gear you sold me, when I steal your kills and tell lies about you on bulletin boards, that's not really me. I'm just roleplaying. I'm a wonderful person.</p>
<p>Don't hate me because I was rude to you this morning in the coffee shop. All the people who know me in this online community love me. I'm a wonderful listener, I remember details confessed to me in private, and I give good advice. I always drop whatever I'm doing to help other people with their projects, and my time is always spent making other people happy. I'm never abrupt, never rude, and always patient. I'm known for having a kind word for everyone I meet. So try to understand, if I let my dog crap on your lawn, if I mash the close door button in the elevator as you run up to it, if I point out that your new sweater makes your face look yellow - that's not really me. The real me is online. I'm a terrific person.</p>
<p>The concept of reinventing your persona online is not a new one. From the first shy person to crack a joke on a BBS to the fat guy pretending to be fifteen year old girl in AOL chat rooms, people have taken advantage of the anonymity of the internet to create selves that were smarter, better looking, more popular, or just plain different. And, really, who gives a monkey's ass? If you're never going to meet the innocent and flirtatious Krissy and see the butterfly tattoo on her perky ass, does it actually matter if Krissy logs off and uses a urinal before he flips on the porn channel and settles down with a jar of mayonnaise? Admit it, you got a mental image. My gift to you.</p>
<p>I was talking with a friend the other day about her thoughts of the perfect online game. One of her key points, as I understood it, was the removal of anonymity. One character per game. The player becomes responsible for his reputation, because if he screws over a bunch of people, he can't simply escape to a twink. The player has to watch how much trauma and drama she inflicts on her guildmates, because the identity she created is the one she has to live with if she wants to play.</p>
<p>There was an article in the newspaper the other day about online passports. An individual or a company would register their online identities with the government, or a designated agency. If someone were to cheat, lie to, offend, defraud, or abuse their fellow man online, the faceless cyber villain can be associated with a real person, with a face and a mailing address. I'll bet you people with passwords like your dog's name or your birthday would get a lot more careful if that came to pass. You'd sure as hell stop leaving your passwords on a little sticky note on your monitor. Oh, shit, I should move these sticky notes.</p>
<p>While I'm all for accountability, while I'm all for measures that avoid fraud, I don't know how I feel about this. I don't think the one character rule would work - most people don't pick the perfect character their first time around in a game. And it's a game, for crying out loud. I don't want to build a whole life online, my actual life takes too much energy. I want to kill stuff, horse around with my guildmates, and have big boobs. That's all I want from a game. If I feel like being a lizard today, I don't want to rule out being a minotaur tomorrow. But what if each character were tied to the others, so a /who brought up not just the character you were on, but all the identities you have in that game? That's a possibility in future entertainment.</p>
<p>As for the all encompassing registered online persona, gah. You'll notice I'm in no big hurry to share my real name and exact mailing address. That's because the online world is a little different from the physical one. Out here in my "real" life, I can judge situations by how I feel, I can pick up on threatening cues and call the cops. My friend Krissy is actually a fifteen year old girl, not some trucker named Dodgeball who thinks about tying me to a chair and pelting me with his extensive Beanie Baby collection.</p>
<p>And of the above two examples, well, they're both impossible. Most people are a mix of the two. Nice sometimes, obnoxious and mean at others, people tend to go through the day doing the best they can. Asking people to be consistent is like asking the convenience store lady to put on some goddam gloves before she hands me my hot dog. It's just never going to happen. But my examples are relevant, because often you find people using their time online to be something more interesting than who they think they are. Which face is the mask? If you took off the mask, what would you find underneath?</p>
