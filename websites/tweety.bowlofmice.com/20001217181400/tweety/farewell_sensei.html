<p>The link to The Dojo goes nowhere, because The Sensei, aka Chai, closed his site down. For those of you who never played a monk, this was THE site for anyone who either played a monk, or wanted EQ news from someone with the cajones to tell it like it is.</p>
<p>Some of y'all started reading my hissy fits from the EMarr message board, where you may have seen a reference to Gerome (now The Asshole Formerly Known As Gerome, since he sold his account and put a down payment on a new house) being the inspiration for Tweety. This is true, because Gerome the Peeping Gnome (yeah, yeah, he was an Erudite, but that doesn't rhyme, shut up) had a special way with flames and rants. He's one of two people that could make me laugh so hard I wet myself.</p>
<p>The other was Chai.</p>
<p>Full disclosure: I am in the same player guild as Chai. I use the present tense, because the Tarsis Shriners are not an EQ guild, they're a group of friends who have been playing games together since the text MUDD Arctic. In order to join, you need to be a real life friend of one of the members. Therefore, once a Shriner, always a Shriner. Look for us to be delivering a smackdown in The Next Big Thing.</p>
<p>A fair number of people discovered this sucky ass site through a link from The Dojo. If you find me half as funny as you found him, you're giving me an enormous compliment. </p>
<p>In his farewell message, he pointed out that "The Sensei" was not the full description of the man writing the rants. I can't say I know him any better in real life than most of you, jeez, the guy lives practically on the other coast from here. I'll tell you this, though - the guy was one of the first monks ever to level to 50, he could run a raid like a god, he gave advice to junior monks that made the difference between a good night and a bad one, and he really is as funny as his rants. </p>
<p>The Dojo, and the psychotic personality behind it, will be missed. Sayonara, Sensei.</p>
