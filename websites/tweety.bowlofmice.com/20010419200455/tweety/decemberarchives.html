<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE: 12/27/00 - Site rearrangement</p>
<p>Nothing pissed me off today except my own website. Those of you who have been with me since the Geoshitties site know that the "design" hasn't changed much since inception. I had a few things in mind for this website - text only, and a place to rant. Colors were chosen on the highly scientific principle of "ooh pretty." The text-only thing came out of my desire to make the site load fast, that and when I started I didn't have the faintest idea how to upload my own graphics. For that matter, I didn't have the faintest idea of what HTML commands existed. I still don't, really. Y'all should see my desk. I am the Queen of Post It Notes, with little square reminders of how to make the copyright symbol, how to change the pixel size, and so on.</p>
<p>But anyway. I also figured, when I started, that I'd do maybe 150 hits a week, and then fade into obscurity around about November. I thought I'd run out of stuff to bitch about around October, hence the obscurity by November. When my roommate set me up this fancy site on his domain towards the end of September, I told him to put in a five digit hit counter. My old counter clicked over each and every time the main page was loaded (including when someone hit the "back" button). This counter registers one hit per user per day, assuming the user leaves his browser open between views. I assumed my hits would drop drastically - a six digit counter would just depress me.</p>
<p>So, here I am, nearly January, over the 100K mark, and the list of rants was getting so long as to be unwieldy. Hence the archived rants, still available for your consumption but not in the great big list anymore. And, um, gosh, /em blush, thanks for reading.</p>  
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE: 12/26/00 - Corrections, post-holiday EQ</p>
<p>Correction: EQ is not rated M for Mature, it is rated T for Teen. I suck. Please cease lashing me with bamboo sticks, or at minimum get in line behind everyone else. My point still stands: This game is not intended for anyone under fourteen unless a knowledgeable parent supervises him or her.</p>
<p>So, how many people got EQ for Christmas? Field reports are trickling in. Newbie areas seem to actually have a few newbies in them, as opposed to twinks. Apparently the game now come with a slip of paper instructing people on how to beg, however, because the number of people screeching about being low level and poor is up higher than ever.</p>
<p>I need to remind people that I never had a character named Tweety in any game, and I never will. That would be like walking up to Fort Knox wearing a "Hi, I'm a Bank Robber" T-shirt.</p>
<p>Today's rant was inspired by a reader who sent in a quote for "overheard in the game," which appears below. (To the person who sent it in - sorry I didn't include your name, I can't find the damn email.) I hope you're entertained, and I'll catch y'all later.</p>
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE: 12/22/00 - Happy Freaking Holidays
<p>All across the USA, people are looking at their clocks, thinking, "How early do I need to leave the office to avoid the traffic?" Answer? THREE DAYS AGO. ABANDON HOPE ALL YE WHO DRIVE THIS WEEKEND. Ah, the holidays. Good cheer and presents on every doorstep, whether you go for the minor-holiday-blown-out-of-proportion-so-Jewish-children-don't-feel-left-out version or the ancient-pagan-holiday-taken-over-by-a-struggling-cult variety. Don't get me wrong, I've got plenty of holiday spirit. Last night, I made tacos, and when I brought the platter to the basement so we could play video games while we ate, I also brought down paper napkins printed with little holly designs.</p>
<p>Sorry, sorry, it's just that where is it written that those of us without children must travel to someone else's house for the holiday weekend? Is there some reason I must leave my little nest with its ashtrays and CD collection? Because I haven't given birth, I have to spend five hours on INTERSTATE 95 SOUTH, widely perceived as a creation of SATAN? This year, it's looking like a choice between ending a relationship and spending four days with an inbred psychotic piranha who hates my non-blond, non-perky guts. Folks, I tell you now, if you hate your significant other's family, either move across country or break it off early. It's a bad sign when your partner screams YOU HATE MY FAMILY DON'T YOU and you respond with I'D RATHER FUCK A PORCUPINE THAN SPEND TWO MINUTES WITH YOUR MOTHER EVER AGAIN. Here's another tip - mentioning a man's mother in the same sentence with fornicating a spiny mammal is BAD. Even if he hates her as much as you do. ESPECIALLY if he hates her as much as you do.</p>
<p>Moving right along! What I Want For the Holidays, to your right. Have a good weekend, Merry Commercialism to All, and to All a Good Office Party. And may a higher power bless you and yours.</p>
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE: 12/20/00 - The money of it all
<p>Got an interesting letter from a reader, who went through the math of running a game company, and drew the following conclusion. Anje wrote:</p>
<p>"The reason Sony formed SOE and brought Verant under full corporate control (think they could have if Verant was REALLY making money?) is because the Strategic Planners at Sony have decided that MMOG is a major, if not THE major, form of entertainment 10 years from now. If there is nothing else the Japanese are good at, it's the willingness to sacrifice near term revenue for long term success. Some would replace "success" with "domination". Just ask Detroit. Whatever is good about Detroit's automobiles today is the direct result of the Japanese auto industry's crushing domination of the world marketplace for 2 decades.</p>
<p>"In short, Sony likes Verant for the pedigree value it will have a decade from now. And all those other companies wanting a slice of the pie? Well, there's lots of money to be made for a few new players, but when AO, DAoC, SB, Sovereign, and Star Wars all join the list of MMOG choices within a year or two, there just won't be enough money to go around."</p>
<p>An interesting point I tend to agree with. How many of us are willing to send ten bucks a month to more than one game? How many of us are willing to pay more than that price benchmark? Something to ponder anyway.</p>
<p>Alert readers also notified me of a new slap in the face in Velious. There's a apparently a really neato ring you can quest for. The first step to making this thing is to sew together pelts and make a no drop blanket. The third step involves smithing a no drop dagger. You see the no drop? Instead of setting up a quest where all the tailors and smiths could finally feel useful, Verant created a situation where EVERYONE needs to be a smith or a tailor. No word on whether or not the quest can be chained like the Jboots quest (one person turns in the ring, and the person who wants the boots turns in the rest). Good planning! Thanks! Mutter.</p>
<p>Catch you tomorrow, gang.</p>
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE: 12/18/00 - Trade skills
<p>I assume that 99.9% of my readers are also <a href=http://www.lumthemad.net>Lum</a> readers, mostly because you tell me so in email and on my boards, so I'm also assuming you all have read the Nixon Goes to China article. Right now, I'm still chuckling over my mental image of Lum's wife getting comfy in Verant Headquarters and informing the testers of each and every broken thing she can think of. If anything about the trade skills gets fixed in the next couple of patches, you probably have her to thank.</p>
<p>News that amuses - so, I'm on the www.everquest.com site, looking for something, and I glance up in the upper left hand corner. There's always been a thumbnail of Firiona Vie, everyone's favorite useless elf. THIS time, however, she's wearing a red bustier, and holding a candy cane instead of her staff. The finishing touch is the teeny little Santa hat perched on her blond head. Someone had fun with that.</p>
<p>That's it for random babbling, please file out the door to your right, read the new rant, and move along about your day. For those of you toiling away in offices, dreaming of working from home, I promise you Mondays still suck even if you're barefoot and smoking cigarettes at your desk.</p>
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE: 12/14/00 - Gamers Magazine</p>
<p>I'm touched. I really am. It seems your favorite angst-ridden bird has made the new issue of Computer Games magazine. Sniff. Of course, the author apparently didn't know I had a website, didn't know that while letting of steam appeals to her more than lawsuits it still got my player account banned, and finally, didn't know I was female. I, being the helpful citizen I am, called her and informed her voice mail of my gender. I do hope she gets pointed to my site someday, because I really, really want the screenshot that went with her article. It's a dragon, flaming the crap out of a little fighter. What the hell is it with me that make outsiders assume I'm male? It must be my charm and demure demeanor.</p>
<p>Wow, a whole lot of you have kids. Yowsers. The email bag was loaded with parents writing in response to the most recent hissy fit. I hereby offer up a prayer to the small god of rational people that reads, "Thank you, small god, for encouraging smart people to breed." I cannot express how happy I am that some of you (gasp) monitor your kids' exposure to gaming and television.</p>
<p>No rant today, love muffins, I'm working on something for my other gig (writing for the Corporation, duh, go drive up the hit counter). Catch you tomorrow, I promise you I'll have something pissing me off.</p>
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE: 12/13/00 - Dark Angel, Dark Age of Camelot, I like em both</p>
<p>Those of you who heard from me via email in the site's absence are probably rubbing your hands together, wondering what the rant against server hosts is going to sound like. I'm going to have to disappoint you, guys. As I've mentioned in other places, this domain is owned by a very good friend, who charges me a grand total of nothing for the space, maintenance, and consulting (meaning I turn around and holler at the guy at the desk behind me, "Goddammit, how do I make the font size bigger again?") So, there was a rant, but it involved me throwing empty cigarette packs at someone's head and making him watch Dark Angel with me.</p>
<p>I don't know what it is about that show - Jessica Alba couldn't act her way out of a wet paper bag. I keep telling myself, she's getting better, and she's awfully pretty….But I am COMPLETELY sucked in, week after week. Man, I want Logan so bad. What a hottie. And, oh yeah, there's like a plot and stuff. And the people on the show look like PEOPLE, not mannequins.</p>
<p>The mail bag is full! Lots of you had some great comments to make on my Mistmoore rant, in terms of WHY you check spoilers. A lot of it is "must-read" stuff for game developers, and I'll be putting up a "The Readers Speak" bit in a few days.</p>
<p>Speaking of game developers, some of you who are following my new gig at The Corporation know that I went to visit the peeps making Dark Age of Camelot. It looks real nice, y'all, I strongly suggest you addicts check their shit out. I think it was either Lum or a Lummie who described the game as "Everquest, without the parts that suck." If they can keep all the things we love about the Qrack (and there are many, or we wouldn't be sitting here yapping about it) and keep out the bits that create rant sites, it's going to be a heck of a game.</p>
<p>All right, that's enough for the day. Check out the rant on why I don't give a green goddam about The Children, to your right.</p>
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE: 12/12/00 - Back Up!</p>
<p>Merciful assmonkeys, my site is back up! It came home! The server is speaking to me again! That chicken I sacrificed to John Smedley pleased him! Um… okay. I'm just so damn happy it came back. You can all stop emailing me now, I did NOT quit my site. Let me finish some other stuff, and then I'll update the new rant, etc.</p>
<p>I kiss you, Mr. Domain Server! I kiss you! Don't leave me ever again!</p>
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE: 12/6/00 - Velious</p>
<p>So, Velious was released. I got a bird's eye view, no pun intended, when my two roommates loaded it up to play at the South Pole of our favorite virtual world. No maps, no cheaters, no quest spoilers, a brand new continent. They ran their little ogres and trolls over this brave new world, and it was so damn pretty. This isn't a review, so I'm not going into details, but I did notice one thing that was so damn funny, I had to share. At about 8 PM EST, the guys charged over a bridge shaped like a dragon skeleton (can I say wow here? WOW it was cool looking) and into a new zone. Right behind them was a mage, level 57. The first place the boys arrived at was a little orc camp. The 57 mage stopped there to kill an orc, and the guys ran on. It was a strike force, just checking out the scenery, whacking a monster, moving on to see more. Seven hours later, the guys were charging back to the zone with the druid ring, and passed the little orc hut again. The mage was STILL THERE. A brand new world to explore, quests to discover, and this dude picked the first camp he came to and didn't budge. Join me, brethren, in a big shout out - LAMER!!! Your mind is its own prison, dumbass.</p>
<p>Sure, on first glance the expansion has issues - your faction gets better and worse with the stuff you kill, but it doesn't tell you WHAT faction gets better and worse. A number of folks are still crashing to their desktops when they try to gate to the new world (gate, the self-only spell, not the teleport). But for crying out loud, last night was a blast in the Qrack. People helping each other, giving advice, discovering traps and quests, making random pickup groups strictly to explore… so why were people playing camp the safe spot in a game that wasn't yet twelve hours old? Mutter.</p>
<p>Today's tantrum is an old rant I actually wasn't planning to post, but it's relevant now, I think.</p>
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE: 12/4/00 - Tweety's a "reporter" now</p>
<p><b>Rant? Rant?! I got yer rant right here! Well, at the bottom of the mutating list of rants, anyway. I actually have several rants that I wrote over the weekend that I'll be posting this week at regular intervals.</b></p>
<p>Why the heck would I have to write backup rants? Well, see, somebody read my site and thought I knew something about games, people, and creative profanity. He and about a dozen people wrote to me offering jobs writing for their websites. I opted not to accept most of these offers, for several reasons - 1) Most of them wanted me to quit doing this site, ie, they weren't interested so much in me as my traffic. 2) They wanted to exhibit me like a chimpanzee, and I felt like I was regarded as Samuel Johnson's dancing bear. 3) Their sites didn't exist, but wouldn't it be cool if, blah blah. 4) Their site was similar in tone to my site, and I thought, gee, running a site can't be that hard, why should I join up with someone else who does all the hard stuff and lets me focus on having a good time?</p>
<p>On further reflection, #4 proves what many of you think, that I'm (say it with me) a dumbass.</p>
<p>But anyway. I did accept one of the offers, from this random wacko named Mr. Poppinfresh. He had several things going for him in his offer, namely free camels. Don't ask. He also didn't want me to quit my own site and drive my traffic to his, so it sounded like it was me the writer he was after, not Tweety the temporarily infamous banned guide.</p>
<p>So, starting tomorrow, I'm not just a big fucking whiner, I'm a big fucking whiner with a press pass. You can find me doing articles and game reviews <a href="http://www.corpnews.com"><span class="greenLink">over at The Corporation</span></a>. And I'll still be here, bitching and moaning, until that big vein in my forehead finally blows.</p>
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE: 12/1/00 - Nothing to see here, move along   
<p><b>Nothing's pissing me off today, sorry.</b></p>
<p>I tried to get annoyed, I really did. When I write the rants, I'm always teetering on a border between laughing hysterically and real true anger. When I'm really pissed off, I usually hold off on posting until I can see the glimmerings of humor in a situation, because I've discovered through feedback from all of you that I'm incoherent when I lose my sense of the ridiculous altogether.</p>
<p>Today, however, everything is just plain ridiculous. So, y'all have a good weekend, and stay out of the goddam shopping malls, they're bad for the soul. You're a computer geek, do your holiday shopping online or something.</p>
