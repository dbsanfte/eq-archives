<p>So, the newest improvement to Everquest is a little game within a game. Somewhere, a merciful programmer noticed that certain aspects of the game were SO GODDAM DULL and downtime was SO EXTENSIVE that people were doing things like laundry and watching television while they waited to hunt, level, cast spells, travel to meet friends… in short, to play EQ. Out of the goodness of his heart, he leapt into action (on his own time) to solve the problem. The result? Gems. A little transparent game that pops up when you type /gems.</p>
<p>I heard about this, and thought to myself, what about Naked Tetris? This was a game I downloaded off the net maybe four years ago. It looked like Tetris, it played like Tetris, but instead of boring little blocks, the figures were little naked men and women bent into odd postures. If the little people matched up just right, they would make little groaning sounds. If you got certain combinations, they would have an orgasm and disappear. The soundtrack was straight from the 70s - BAM chicka bam BAM. Naked Tetris is far more appropriate for the gaming market, according to Gathering of Developers. (Hey! Wolfpack guys! Take note! I want Naked Tetris while I'm crushing my bread!)</p>
<p>So anyway, Gems is a nice start. I have some other ideas I'd like to humbly suggest:</p>
<p>1) Bridge. I used to play bridge on Yahoo all the time before I discovered Everquest. I kind of miss that. Wouldn't it be really nifty if, after a good hard round of South Karana gnolls, your party could take a mana break and play a hand of bridge? Maybe a little virtual card table could pop up under the tree near the spires. Heck, all the people standing around the spires waiting for a group could get a tournament going.</p>
<p>2) Offer prizes. This could be tied into Gems! Finish twenty waves, get a pearl. Finish a hundred, get a blue diamond. Not only would people's characters be quietly sitting still instead of creating lag and spamming the zone with their latest Backstreet Boys gossip, they could be intent on increasing their wealth and not camping Hate for those stinking jewels. Or "gems" you might say.</p>
<p>3) Advertising. While you're healing or medding, get all the details of future games coming from Verant! This could also be linked to some sort of "virtual store," with a reward built in. Buy a t-shirt, and find your mana or health magically increased to full!</p>
<p>4) Hold music. You know, like when you call Verant for customer service, and you sit on hold for forty five minutes. They actually play good stuff on their hold music station - it's all 80s stuff. During the first heady days of my banning, I spent many an hour on hold with Verant. Sometimes five of my favorite songs would play in a row, and when someone finally got around to answering the phone, I'd be so pumped from singing along I'd forget why I was pissed off. More than one guy was treated to hearing me wail "POUR some SUG-ar on ME!" when he clicked over to me. Of course, the time the poor minimum wage slave clicked over and heard me howling "When I think aBOUT you I TOUCH MYSELF" he flat out hung up, so as hold music goes maybe that one oughta go. But I digress. Wouldn't hold music during your downtime be swell? Maybe you could even choose your favorite kind of music, like an MP3 player or something.</p>
<p>5) A Web browser. Choose from several carefully chosen websites suitable for the model EQ player. Sure, my own site wouldn't be on the list, but think about it - reading Whineplay while you play. Could anything besides maybe chewing tinfoil and shoving hot wires under your fingernails be better?</p>
<p>Oh dear, I think that last suggestion lacked the proper tone of enthusiasm.</p>
