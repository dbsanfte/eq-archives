<p>Congratulations! We are very glad you have chosen to adopt a monk, and we hope that you'll find this information handy.</p>
<p>Keep autosplit turned on. Monks need loose change for a variety of things, but the primary reason you should keep your monk supplied with copious amounts of copper and silver is territory marking. Regretfully, no one has figured out a really good way to get odors into the game. As a result, simply pissing in the corners of their pull radius does not serve as a sufficient territorial warning to those not in the monk's pack. Thus, when you hear your particular monk mutter things such as, "Fucking ogres, couldn't beat a clue into their heads with a two by four," and drop copper pieces, rest assured your monk is not talking to you. Rather, she is engaging in a ceremony designed to ward off intruders, and alert other monks of her presence. Continue to provide her with large amounts of small change so that she can fully mark her turf, and feel safe and secure in the knowledge that you will provide for her.</p>
<p>We are not sure at this time how much speech a monk can comprehend. Some very special monks have a known vocabulary of up to 25 words, but most monks can only speak about twelve or so. The most common are: Sowplease, Feigned, Mending, Regenplease, Hunting, Incoming, Healplease, and Oh Fuck Train To Zone. Occasionally you might hear "DROP YER JOCKS, PULL UP YER SOCKS, AND GET OFF THE TRACKS I'M COMING THROUGH!!!!" but don't be alarmed. This appears to be a tribal greeting and should not concern you in the slightest.</p>
<p>To properly socialize your monk, you must speak to it often. As we discussed in the previous paragraph, there is no point in expecting the monk to communicate back to you, but you must insist on some sort of response if you ever want to be able to take your monk out in public without embarrassment. Thus, demand responses at all times, regardless of what the monk is doing. We have found that a monk attempting to pull the southeast corner of the unbroken Plane of Fear is especially entertaining when you send him tells.</p>
<p>Which leads us to the next topic, enjoying your monk. There would be no need to keep them as pets if you weren't going to have fun with them. Monks are especially fun to have in guild chat attempting risky corpse retrievals. Imagine sitting safely at your bind point, naked as the day you were rolled, as your pet squeaks, groans, screams, and makes the noise for which monks are renowned - ARG. Nothing funnier! Other fun things to do include sending a monk after a mob with charm capabilities and then zoning - nothing says loving better than a creature (who can quad hit and kick for insane amounts of damage) losing its mind! Or perhaps, if you're feeling frisky, send your monk out to pull something big and nasty, and then sneak away and pull something yourself. Do not tell the monk you have done so, and then blame her for a massive overpull! Monks love that!</p>
<p>Discipline is the final topic we must address. Your monk must be taught who is in charge of pulling for a raid, and it seems clear that society tells us that essentially everyone EXCEPT the monk is. Do not be shy about sending a monk tells, mid pull, suggesting the mobs you wish the monk to pull. Encourage all other members of the raid to send tells with their suggestions. You will accomplish two goals; one, your monk will polish her multitasking skills, and two, she will sure know who is boss.</p>
<p>Ah, the monk. They are an elusive species, mysterious, with behavioral quirks we are only beginning to understand. One word of warning - please be patient with your monk, because remember, no matter how tame it appears, too much teasing will result in half of Lower Guk coming down around your ears.</p>
