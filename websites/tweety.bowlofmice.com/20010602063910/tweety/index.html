<p class="update">WEEKLY UPDATE - 5/31/01</p>
<p>Man, this week has flown past and shredded me like a charmed, thorned, buffed, and sowed rat in a newbie yard. I heard about that little "joke," and my nurturing side felt just awful for the poor little newbies. The side that created Tweety to begin with about peed herself laughing.</p>
<p>Thanks for all the responses regarding the Memorial Day rant. I can't begin to answer them all, there are over 400 emails at this point. I was afraid folks would think I'd slipped my gears and become pro-American imperialism. But it sounds like everyone got my point, which was no matter how you feel about American military actions, the people in the military deserve our respect and support. As usual, you all did more for me than I did for you. My Memorial Day at the Wall (that's the Vietnam memorial, for you out of town folks) became meaningful on a deeper level when a friend and I found the name of a staff sergeant who had served with a reader. All of y'all with websites would do me a huge favor if you'd please show support for the Moment next year.</p>
<p>T-shirts? What the hell? Got an email from a reader who tells me he plans to appear in public wearing a "Tweety r0xxors" t-shirt. First of all, there's something ironic about Tweety and dewdspeak together. Second of all, where the hell do you get these t-shirts? Can I have one? Can I have some sort of royalty fee? Sheesh. It's almost as scary as the guy who told me he makes money translating Tweety rants into idiomatic Italian.</p>
<p>Here's the new rant, and here's me tipping back a drink wondering why four day weeks seem longer than normal ones. Have a good weekend.</p>
<p>Remember, you're always free to email me with questions and comments.</p>
