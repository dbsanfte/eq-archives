<p>First, who I am: My name is Kimberly Bishop, mother of two, writer of fantasy fiction and fairly disgruntled customer of yours. My Station name is Wytche. I am the person that called Verant after talking with "Mystere" just after the banning occurred. I spoke with three people during that conversation, and probably caused 70% of the headache you have had the last few days. Now, I wish to apologize for that headache, but not for the reasons behind it. I've written and re-written this close to 20 times. I'll keep this as orderly as I can to explain my discontent.</p>
<p>Upon hearing what had happened to Mystere, I decided to call Verant personally to find out what happened and what the EULA really means. The first person I spoke with was very kind and very shaken, not having any idea how to deal with me. After about 10 minutes or so, I asked him to pass me along to a Supervisor, so that I could find the answers and explanations I sought. The person I then spoke to identified himself as a former "well-respected" GM on Brell, who knew of Mystere and was aware of the incident. I asked a good many questions and was still quite confused and dissatisfied by the conversation. What it was coming down to was that Verant didn't want 'people like that' playing their game. That a person, simply by virtue of a story they wrote was being judged as a 'sicko' or pervert. As an author, I know that is simply NOT how the literary world works. With that attitude, it must be assumed that literary legends must be considered in the same light. Is Stephen King a 'sicko'? Possibly, but neither you nor I have the right <b>morally</b> to make that decision, nor do we have the right <b>legally</b> to say that as that constitutes slander to some degree. So, with this in my head and more and more questions growing by the second during my conversation, I asked to speak to Mr. Scotto himself.</p>
<p>This is where it got ugly and all of my faith in Verant/Sony was lost. This man was pompous, rude, aggressive and defensive to my concerns and questions. Each time I started to ask or state my questions and feelings, he spoke over me and interrupted. I continuously had to ask him to "please just hear me out before interrupting me'. That plea fell on deaf ears. He spoke to me about Mystere's situation, even after stating that he could not. He used the terms "people like him" and "people like that" multiple times. I suppose it was fortunate for all that I already knew Mystere was played by Greg, lest your company had been the one to give me that tidbit of information. Mr. Scotto stated in no uncertain terms that the banning was decided by a council and was decided due to the content <sexual and violent> of the story and the "type of person" that would write in that manner. There was no mention of copyrights or use of Verant's property. There was no mention of trademarks or 'tarnished' images. Simply that this was not the 'sort of person' that they wanted in the Everquest world. He even went so far as to say that it was for the protection of the players from that 'kind of person' that this was being done. At that time, I began to lose it. I was enraged for two reasons. The first being the audacity of this individual to pass judgment on someone by their fictional work. By his standards, it could have been assumed that I was a murderer and a psychotic masochist. I am neither, but I have written stories as such. The second reason I was furious was that no consideration had been taken as to this persons' in-game relationships and reputation. No research was done into who the player behind the fiction actually was. I had that knowledge first hand and started to say that Mystere's player was well respected and had been a gaming companion of mine for over a year. When I began to state this, his exact words were, "It doesn't matter." He went on to explain that he had the final say and no amount of evidence or information would even be taken into consideration. What does that say to a consumer? It says, "Shut-up, you are wasting my time and what you have to say doesn't matter to me." As a matter of fact, that was the tone of his entire conversation with me. I hope that your customer service department records the conversations so that you can go back and hear how this man spoke to me. I'm certain you don't, since I was never advised of a recording.</p>
<p>When I got off the phone, I was more angry than I had been when I first called. I immediately entered into a chat over a message service with a huge group of the Role-players from Brell. I told them exactly what I had been told and the insanity I felt Verant was using as their excuse. In case you haven't noticed, we are a group of well educated, creative, determined people, and we were mad. So, the posts began and the e-mails were sent. I personally gathered the e-mail addresses for every news site and gaming magazine I could find and sent them the links to the threads already started and told my perspective on the incident. I emphasized my position on the lack of courtesy and fairness (my opinion, of course) shown to Mystere and to myself during that phone conversation with Mr. Scotto. Some called in favors with companies they were associated and spread the word. Players posted to every Everquest and Gaming board that could be found. The Everquest community spoke and it seemed to all of us that it fell on deaf ears.</p>
<p>Now you have apologized and made an attempt to make things right. Some accuse me of not looking at things from 'your' (the company's) point of view. I have. I understand. It makes me ill. I have to live with that. This entire situation is akin to book burning in my eyes and many others' as well. You see, those that complained could complain to the bookstores about books they sell that contain the same type of fiction. Would the books be removed from the store? I seriously doubt it. Why? Because this is America and we have rights. Yes, you have a legal clause to hide behind in order to 'protect' your good name, but that does not make it morally correct. It doesn't change the sadness I have in my heart or the disappointment in your company for stealing happiness from someone I call a friend and have a great deal of respect for. It doesn't change the anger the community has at their pleas falling on seemingly deaf ears. It doesn't change the fact that the role-playing community on Brell, by far one of the best, is now broken and marred forever by an injustice in their eyes. The fear will curb the creative talents and the fire will die. The Vision(TM) has been ruined for many, dare I say, most.</p>
<p>I spoke with Mystere today and learned of your phone conversation with him. I am pleased and commend you for taking that step. I feel the step has come a little too late to rectify the damage done. Even knowing that Mystere is satisfied, hasn't changed my struggle to decide whether I will continue to play. I need to think on the prospect of giving a company money that my faith and trust in has disappeared. That is the position many are in now, I'm afraid. So, we will all gather and talk. We will wait to receive your guidelines and rules and then we will decide if we can live with them and what they represent. Many have left already and moved to AC. Turbine and Microsoft should send you flowers, fruit and balloons. I myself went out the day after my phone conversation and purchased AC. I now hold active accounts with both gaming services. I have a decision to make and it's going to be a hard one. Everquest does have a wonderful gift to give. It breeds friendships and camaraderie that's simply phenomenal. The proof of that gift is that headache I referred to earlier. Whether you like it or not, your gamers have formed a family and the family is tight and strong. And the family will exist to some extent even after the game is gone. For that, we owe you our thanks as well.</p>
<p>Now, I patiently await your new guidelines and explanations of your rules. I would hope that you would take some of the role-player's views and opinions into consideration. There is a lot of trust your company needs to rebuild. The blind-faith that existed in the beginning is gone. They have that saying, "once bitten, twice shy". I'd say that applies in huge proportions in the given situation. Get to know your customers; treat them with respect; value their opinions and educate them on your reasoning and ideals. Do these things and you will be far more powerful than you are by simply being Sony or Verant. Perhaps if you spend more time in 'our world' we will be more comfortable in yours.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Kimberly Bishop</p>
