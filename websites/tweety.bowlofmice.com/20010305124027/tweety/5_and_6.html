<p> Email #5: We go to Defcon 3</p>

     Subject: I got to meet Lady D tonight</p>
<p>Dear Michelle,</p>
<p>I am sorry you do not wish to discuss the other points I brought up, because there might have been something good to come out of all of this. I shall however, take the hint and accept I could not possibly have anything of value to share.</p>
<p>I am a trifle unclear as to how my player account is affected, beyond the time needed to deflag my account of its guide status. The user agreement I accept each time I log in states that you "may terminate this agreement immediately and without notice if...upon gameplay, chat or any player activity whatsoever which is, in our sole discretion, inappropriate and/or in violation of the spirit of the Game AS SET FORTH IN THE PLAYER RULES OF CONDUCT (caps mine - Tweety), which are posted...etc." None of my play characters have ever been remotely connected with my activities as a guide or as a poster to forums. The outside forums are irrelevant, considering I have not posted any material to the Station forums. My player account has no warnings against it for any reason - for I have never cheated, used an exploit, used foul language, abused a guide or another player, or harmed anyone else's gameplay experience. I have been playing since December of 1999.</p>
<p>In addition, the Guide Policy manual states, in section 9.2.1, "Anyone who such damages the morale of the EverQuest Customer Service Program shall be subject to disciplinary action up to and including dismissal from the Program." While I do not acknowledge that I have harmed morale in the slightest, and in fact I believe I provided a few laughs, I will accept that this is the reason for my dismissal. I do not deny posting in unacceptable forums, albeit in an anonymous manner. The point is, nowhere in the manual is it stated or implied that I can be banned from the game as a player due to my actions as a guide.</p>
<p>Please clarify, as I wish to begin payment on my account to avoid any interruption in my playing experience. It is an extremely enjoyable game in spite of the actions of a very few fellow players.</p>
<p> Sincerely,</p><br><br>
<p>Email #6: Michelle's response: NADA. She couldn't be bothered.</p>
<p>(By the way, it has come to my attention that there is another section on possible punishment. Thanks for letting me know. I can't change what I already sent, though. )</p>
