<p>Today I'm going to say things that aren't nice about a certain subsection of the computer gaming community. Before I hear from every twelve year old who managed to beat the parental filters installed to protect them from my filthy language, let me start off with a few basic definitions. I neither know nor care if these are real definitions, I just plan to use them for the rest of this rant.</p>
<p>PVP (noun, short for Player Versus Player) - A game environment in which players kill players for adrenaline, profit, and possibly roleplaying even though I personally never met anyone roleplaying anything past a bully with Mommy's credit card. If you are a true blue roleplayer, spare me the indignation, I don't mean you. Also used as an adjective to describe an individual who plays in that environment.</p>
<p>PK (noun, short for Player Killer) - A bully with Mommy's credit card and severe unresolved issues.</p>
<p>It's clear we're looking at two different animals when we're talking about PVP and PK, but the PVP environment is absolutely certain to attract the loathed PK. I believe that the more a game is marketed to the crafters and roleplayers, the more a true PK is going to be attracted to the game - because he sees all that and thinks, "Mmmm, helpless babies. Crunchy." And the only way to beat these cretins EVEN ACCORDING TO THE GAME DESIGNERS is to become more powerful than the cretins. Which doesn't leave a lot of time for blacksmithing.</p>
<p>We need to get away from the EQ mentality if we're going to have a real discussion of the topic, though. One of the biggest problems people have with PK is only related to Everquest, and that is the simple fact that getting whacked by a prepubescent fuckhead can waste hours of playtime, and cost you a beloved piece of gear or cash. I'm not talking about a battle, or some piece of roleplay theatre in which the Holy Paladin is gunning for the Dread Necro - I'm talking about the little shit who watched me fight a wisp, win with fifteen hit points remaining, and then pounced on me shrieking "I ownjooz!" (When I first saw that, I had no clue what he meant. He owned Jews? Huh? I thought maybe he was a skinhead or something. You dewd assholes really need to release a dictionary for those of us who finished high school without being arrested.) In EQ, an entire week can be shot to hell by one asshole, and you can lose more than that if you're on the coin +1 item server.</p>
<p>It's the way the game is set up. Comparing EQ's PVP to a MUDD's PVP is a serious fallacy, because in a MUDD you pick your ass up and get back to business without wasting more than a few minutes. I really enjoy the EQ gameplay without PVP, and feel that the PVP server was basically set up too badly to warrant me a fighting chance (kinda like the early days of UO, which burned me so badly I won't even try the game). Let's pray that other PVP game designers WON'T be smoking any crack, and being dead will just be annoying instead of a fucking nuclear devastation. </p>
<p>The other problem with PVP (in an EQ sort of game) is that when equipment is king, no one wants to lose anything. Bryan wrote in a note to me: "[Game designers try] to over-control their game's economy by restricting key resources based on time rather than effort, forcing everyone into non-consensual competition for those resources in the form of farmers, campers, loot hogs, etc.  It seems to me like almost every case [of opinion on PVP] is a matter of how much risk is too much, and each person's line is going to be drawn in a slightly different place." Exactly! People have varying amounts of attachment to their characters and their gear, and how they feel about being ganked by a pimply-faced weasel dickbeater punk is going to be directly related to how attached to/how much they need the gear and the experience to enjoy the game. The trouble is, that spectrum of feeling is so enormous that no game designer is going to be able to make everyone happy.</p>
<p>So, let's leave the EQ concept of PVP tossed neatly back into the barf bag it came from. What about the future? Bryan also raised some interesting questions in his email: "Just how much immunity from jerks can or should a multiplayer game provide?  And just how reasonable is it to be annoyed with a company that does "cater" to some set of jerks you don't like, provided they also allow you to opt out of having to deal with them?" Everquest has done their best to cater to everyone - but ask someone with a red name on a blue server how well coexistence works out. Oh, wait, there aren't any to ask. </p>
<p>Shadowbane, Horizons, et al, seem to be answering Bryan's first question with the "police the jerks yourselves" approach. Forgive me, but that sounds remarkably like the complete, total FUBAR situation created during the initial release of Ultima Online. They failed, and they failed hard. The subscriber charts of UO must have looked like a Clinton lie detector printout for the first year, with people coming and going in droves. Nearly everyone I knew who even tried the damn game in the first six months quit, and they included some serious PVP aficionados. The vast majority of UO enthusiasts either built their characters up very early in the game, or came in after the -PVP areas were created.</p>
<p>More Bryan: "Basically it resolves down to I don't want to participate in PvP in a role-playing game unless I either trust the other people I'm playing with or trust the system I'm playing in.  Neither is true in any MMORPG I've seen or can imagine.  PvP and Role-Playing without that trust isn't chocolate and peanut butter, it's more like grapefruit and wine.  Both are acquired tastes, and they aren't likely mix well together as a general rule.  In a small group of friends where you can hold each other accountable, it's a completely different story, but that pretty well precludes the "Massive" part of MMORPG." </p>
<p>If you like PVP, you're in the game for the challenge, the adrenaline, and the rush you get from fighting an opponent that's just as smart as you, and possibly smarter. You are not a PK, because those people only enjoy fighting an opponent who cannot possibly win. If you hate PVP, and have managed to keep your knee from jerking due to reactions to past PK incidents, you hate it because your definition of "fun" does not include the challenge of fighting other players - you'd rather relax, learn a trade, and work with your friends against a monster who will not be seeking revenge on your ass the next time you log in. Nothing wrong with either approach, but they are totally different ideas about what constitutes a good time. There's a third camp, who believe that a good time consists of a little booze and a lot of lesbian porn, but that may just be my guild, I think.</p>
<p>PVP would be fine if it weren't for the PKs. Not once, in all the time I've blown reading boards, have I ever found anyone who admitted LIKING the PK jizzballs, let alone admitted to being one. I think the reason people have such knee jerk negativity about PVP is the misperception that a PVP fan is the same as PK. That's like saying the guy who flips the electric chair switch and the guy sitting in it have a lot in common. (Oh, and spare me, you cute little anti-death penalty activists - until you come up with a solution for murderers and rapists that doesn't involve me paying for their cable TV, I don't want to hear it.) A PK is a whining little scumbucket, who I'd be happy to slaughter. </p>
<p>That would seem to put me in the PVP camp. The problem is, players like me never win the race to uberhood fast enough to be doing the gutting. I always wind up on the cutting board flopping around and oozing out my entrails because I don't have the massive amounts of free time it takes to beat the little fuckers to the high levels. PVP in EQ and its future imitators will simply not work, thanks to the level based game progression and the proliferation of two bit catballers with no lives.</p>
<p>One of the cooler heads on my message board pointed out that PVP is fun, a real rush - for a limited number of hours. After awhile, you need to be able to leave the keyboard and take a leak or get a beer, and it would be nice if you could pop a squat and not hear your avatar die from inside the throne room.  To keep yourself at the level of concentration needed to play PVP effectively in a world with thousands of people (unlike the MUDDs with their 200), you would need to be more obsessive than anything we've previously seen. There's got to be some place for a character to go in which they are safe. </p>
<p>Ah, fuck it, I'm sick of trying to make sense out of the clusterfuck that is this debate. There's only one obvious conclusion: No single game is going to ever be as massive as EQ, ever again. The designers are going to have to pick which side they want to appeal to, and all of us are going to have to pick which side we're on. The argument is all philosophical until the new games come out, anyway. Myself? Well, I'm not sure - but the vision of me in full plate standing over a PK screeching "Who owns who, pissant? Say my name, bitch, SAY MY NAME!" is pretty goddam sweet.</p>
