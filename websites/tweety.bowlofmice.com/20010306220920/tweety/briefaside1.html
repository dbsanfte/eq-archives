<p>Reborn! New and improved!
<p>After getting Tweety drunk enough to believe we are not a complete moron last night, she agreed to revive the Brief Asides™ here.   I thought about opening with a small history of the column, as it has had a three year lifespan on various other sites of note that you most likely don't care about. Then I decided that it just wouldn't be in keeping with my long time dedication to the short attention span format the asides have always had.
<p>So, for the sake of argument, lets just say it doesn't matter where the asides came from, they are here now, for your pleasure/annoyance.   
<p>I will be attempting to send them weekly (weakly?).
<p>Enjoy.
<p>***
<p>We finally saw some of the Everquest™ toys last week.  For those of you who may not have had this extreme pleasure yet, allow us to enlighten you: they suck.
<p>Really nothing more needs to be said about these Barbie doll meets Frankenstein's laboratory creations.  Looks like we will not be adding them to any of our collections, and Darth Maul gets to keep his place of honor in the office as the defending champion of cool looking collectible toys.
<p>Kind of a shame really, since Maul could easily have been unseated by a nicely made Lord Nagafen, or even a female wood elf bard (WITHOUT the lame 'I wanna undress my Ken doll' removable clothing).
<p>***
<p>Take another little piece of my heart now baby!
<p>***
<p>By now, some of you may be wondering whether or not the brief asides are written by nice guys.  Are we the sort to tip sacred cows? Are we merely the apathetic anonymous trying to cash in on the MTV soaked generation X penchant for anything and everything remotely humorous yet bite sized enough not to cause any truly major thought?
<p>To be honest, we have been known to romp through the sacred fields pushing a cow or two over, for no better reason than to hear what a sacred "Moo" might sound like. Can you say you're not curious?  Have we pushed the analogy too far yet?
<p>Doesn't truly matter since we're going to lose half our audience if we dwell on this for longer than three paragraphs so we'll just leave it as is. Our own cows are still hung over anyway and unable to "moo" properly even if someone does manage to tip them today.
<p>(We at Brief Asides™ have no part in anyone misusing the noble, if stupid, farm animals of America's pastures.  No farm animals we're harmed in the making of this aside.)
<p>***
<p>Moo*
<p>*This aside brought to you by my personal inner cow.
<p>***
<p>Tweety just pointed out that Moo, is merely oom backwards.  Possibly this is what makes the cows sacred in the first place.
<p>We, at brief asides have not figured out what possible ramifications this may have on daily life as we know it, but the question has been sent to committee for further discussion.
<p>***
<p>After a heated political discussion here at Tweety headquarters we have come to the conclusion that the revolution must come soon.  All we need now is a direction to lead the coming revolution.  Several possibilities were discussed, ranging from environmental reform, to restructuring the political make up of America, if not the entire world.
<p>We at Brief Asides™ are now accepting submissions, via the message board here, as to what you think the basis for our revolutionary platform should be.
<p>Suggestions which will NOT be accepted are as follows: Advancement of the Aryan nation, a need to reinstate the true King on the throne, advancement of Islam (some of us are not Islamic, and to further such a cause would create a self destructive cycle.  While the hypocrisy of this might actually improve the chances of success, we do not feel it would promote the correct image we at Brief Asides™ are trying to convey)
<p>There are other suggestions, which of course, will be rejected for obvious reasons, but we will allow you to discover those on your own, mostly in the interest of ending this aside before it becomes too boring to comprehend.
<p>***
<p>This is the last Aside for today.  Is it everything you hoped?
<p>(Insert expensive special effect here)
