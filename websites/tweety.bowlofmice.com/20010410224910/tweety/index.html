<p class="update">WEEKLY UPDATE - 4/7/01</p>
<p>I no longer wonder why traffic is so horrible in Washington. It's because most people would rather gnaw off an arm than ride public transportation. You'd think the Metro yellow line was a Japanese commuter special, the way people shove and fight to get on the crowded train - except it wouldn't BE crowded if these fucking Mensas would let disembarking passengers out first. I kept hoping the blind guy would start swinging his cane around. No such luck.</p>
<p>How about that change to the trade bags, huh? It was a good change in a lot of ways, kind of like seat belt laws are good. Protect people from being morons so they can breed more! No, seriously, getting your stuff back if you guess wrong on a recipe is good. Preventing the loss of valuable loot when you lag out with the cursor over the combine button is good. But why make the bags heavier? Couldn't they give out a present without adding a negative element? Is it POSSIBLE for Verant to make an improvement without also shoving a broomstick so far up our collective ass that it comes out our nose? The weight change doesn't hurt anyone but low level monks who can't afford tink bags and crafters. Guess those silly crafters and lowbies don't matter as much as the uber crew.</p>
<p>Lord, I need a real job. I can feel myself getting stupider with every day I spend not using the brain that used to write conference papers. Today's Word, brought to you by the U.S. Government, is "definitalization." It's not a word, goddammit, so why did I have to type it twenty billion times into a database no one will ever look at? Your tax dollars at work - I am making copies of documents, so I can print out descriptions of the documents, so they can be scanned onto a CD, so we can SAVE PAPER.</p>
<p>At least I had plenty of spare brain cells left to write today's rant. Have a good weekend, gang.</p>
<p>Remember, you're always free to email me with questions and comments.</p>
