<span class="yellow" style="font-size:18px;">
<p>We've been seeing a rise in video game violence recently. It seems every time I see a new video game on the shelves it seems to center, in some way, around rewards for violent behavior. What is causing this? 
<p>Violence in schools. All the School shootings are affecting our video game designers, and I for one, want action to be taken. We cannot, as a nation, continue to allow these kids to corrupt our video gaming environment. Game designers all over the country have been following the lead of high school students by turning to violent solutions to their programming problems. Something must be done. 
<p>I call upon all concerned gamers to take a stand against these children and their irresponsible mothers. The future of American gaming is at stake. 
<p>***
<p>Commercial of the week: For Mac CD burners. Kid walks into a theater with various recording artists gathered on the stage. He begins calling out what tracks he wants to put on the CD and in what order...the artists all responding in turn, ending with Barry White "Now you're speaking my language" in response for 'something for the ladies on track six.' 
<p>I noticed a distinct lack of Metallica on the commercial. I'm not sure, but I always got the distinct impression that they were opposed to musical piracy in any form, including this one which, though technically illegal, is openly not enforced. 
<p>Other that, or no one asked them since the vast majority of their fan base...viciously loyal for over 10 years...vanished. Lord knows, no one who was a huge Metallica fan in the late 80's, early 90's of their hey day was ever into rebellious or questionable musical behavior. 
<p>*** 
<p>This aside is dedicated to me laughing at Metallica over issues discussed in the last aside. A moment of silence for the band that was once a favorite here, but whose latest CD is now lower on my 'want' list than "Greatest hits of Barney," and right above "Songs of Inspiration as sung by Jerry Falwell." Credibility is a slippery thing isn't it? 
<p>***
<p>I finally logged onto a friend's Everquest account to play Gems. For those of you unfamiliar with this travesty, the makers of the popular game Everquest have decided in their ultimate vision that since their game contains hours and hours of sitting on your ass staring at an unchanging screen, they would add a side game (wholly unrelated to Everquest), to make the game less mind numbingly dull during the down times. 
<p>The game itself (Everquest) is probably one of the best, if not the best games out there, for its vast worlds of magnificent graphical detail, and real time interaction with thousands of fellow players, and hundreds of thousands of computer controlled enemies. Still, it's somehow sad and wrong that such a pastime would require a separate, unrelated pastime within itself as a diversion. 
<p>The makers of Everquest have promised new multiplayer version of the game in the future, leading one to ponder whether those multiplayer games will require side games of their own to distract from their pointless down times. Although, this will undoubtedly earn applause if they can somehow turn that into a seamless transition into EQ2, by simply having players start the new version of the game by playing in-game during regular Everquest sessions. 
<p>Weird to some, progress to them, comedy to me. 
<p>*** 
<p>The President did Presidential stuff today. 
<p>Hey it's more news than the big networks give you, and I didn't even have to lie about it. 
<p>***
<p>Prediction time! 
<p>I love making predictions here at A Brief Aside and I love even more getting to brag about the accuracy. Here's a new prediction for you, a surprise to some, old news to others: 
<p>The new live action Scooby Doo movie will suck ass. ASS. ASS I tell you. This movie is set up to lay an egg. Ishtar will be more enjoyable. It'll make you yearn for the good old days of live-action Flintstones in Rock Vegas, and Pokemon. 
<p>Just my opinion. 
<p>***
<p>While you're reading this, someone in your country is doing something incredibly stupid. Think about that for a moment. 
<p>Do you know this person? 
<p>Will you smack them for me? 
<p>*** 
<p>For those who may have been confused by that last one, let me define stupid, in the context of this article. 
<p>Stupid...in the context it is used in A Brief Aside, ALWAYS means: "Anything Alyxz thinks is the result of an incomplete thought process." 
<p>I hope that clears things up. 
<p>*** 
<p>Mir came down on March 20. 
<p>Here's a quick poll: 
<p>How many knew the damn thing was still up there? 
<p>How many are amazed by this reality? 
<p>How many recognize it for the colossal waste of funds it was, that could have been put to use for actual progress in Space exploration instead of a gimpy diplomatic tool between nations? 
<p>(We at A Brief Aside are well aware of the masses of data garnered from Mir that have even now not been fully studied and will continue to provide new knowledge for years to come. We did actually do a tiny bit of research on this particular aside, in between sessions of throwing darts at our Kip Winger and Lars Ulrich pictures on the cork board. You care enough to respond, you look up the studies. Congress has several things they paid your money for. Most of them worth almost as much as well...this. I think the Potomac Institute did a nice one. We would provide a link if we gave a rats ass.) 
<p>(Aww screw it. That was far too long. If you read that whole thing we apologize. If you still disagree with the aside...we give up. You're right. Move along now please.) 
<p>*** 
<p>I don't like the word Porn. 
<p>***
<p>Just a thought. 
<p>When you use internet slang as a joke, it can be funny. 
<p>When you use it too often: Congratulations...you're one of the snerts who actually writes like that now.  Welcome to loserville.  No L33T for u. 
<p>Now, some may question A) whether this actually qualifies them for loserville, or B) whether I, geek that I seem to be, am a suitable judge of this.  The answers: A) Yes, it does, and B) Yes, I am. 
<p>If you care to know my qualifications for being such a judge, then consider first: why you care, and second...review question A. 
<p>(We are, in fact, fully aware of the irony of using the word "Snert" in this Aside.)
<p>*** 
<p>I got a lot of mail forwarding me to the Naked news web page, following the discussion about it in the brief asides.   
<p>Truly sad.  Yesterday's joke is now today's reality.  The world plunges deeper into the mire of history as we completely abandon all hope of credibility in normal social pursuits.  I for one am disgusted. 
<p>Besides....my connection speed won't support the full screen version. 
<p>*** 
<p>Bah...you don't need anymore.  Let's stop here.
