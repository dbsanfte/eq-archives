<p>I considered calling this hissy fit "Why can't we legalize retroactive abortions?"
  but I really would hate to start a debate on my right to make a personal
  decision involving my life and my crotch. Anyway.</p>
<p>Norrath is infested with kewl d00dz. I use the term infestation, because they're
  like mice in the food court - they don't outnumber the humans, and they can't
  drive away the humans, but their shit is everywhere and some days their
  presence is obvious enough to make you think twice about eating there.</p>
<p>The question is, where do the d00dz go when they log off? I started looking
  around my real life, searching out d00dizm. What else do I have to do, I'm on
  vacation from Everquest. Amazingly enough, I found them, and they aren't all
  fourteen year old male virgins with poor social skills.</p>
<p>The d00d is behind me at the grocery store, counting the items in my basket
  out loud. And putting one of his items in with mine so he can squawk, "She's
  got sixteen things in the fifteen item lane!" When I hand him back his jumbo
  size bottle of hand lotion, he giggles. He's behind me in the line for the toll
  booth, tapping my bumper and laughing like a hyena. His explanation, when I
  get the rent-a-cop's attention, is that he didn't like my bumper stickers. (I
  wonder which one - "fight prime time, read a book" or "homophobia is a
  social disease" or "pro-choice, pro-child"?) He's the guy in Blockbuster,
  watching me pick out Jackie Chan flicks, and slithering up to tell me babes
  and Jackie Chan movies are his favorite things. He didn't get the hint, even
  when I said pepper spray was my favorite thing. She (!) is the one in the
  drugstore, having a spasm of joy because the clerk did a price check on
  condoms. The average age of the above candidates for genetic elimination is
  probably 35.</p>
<p>Is it just that some people don't attend enough of their state-mandated
  counseling sessions? Is it merely because huffing really does cause brain
  damage? Could it be something in the air, the water, the school system, the
  chemicals in fast food products? I think not, and it isn't just because I
  personally went to public school and think Taco Bell rules at two in the
  morning. I think it's just because some people are too fucking stupid to
  breathe without printed instructions. Someone, somewhere, gave these
  assholes the idea that their attitudes, their desires, and their preferred level of
  personal hygeine was okelly dokelly with the general population. And the
  trouble with the general population is that too many people don't have the
  cajones to pipe up and say, "Listen up, dirtbag: take a shower, shut your hole,
  get spayed or neutered, and take your fucking Ritalin before I make my
  personal contribution to the beautification of America, you waste of perfectly
  good sperm and oxygen. Get out of my face before I do everyone a favor and
  administer a smack down." Listen up, kids, unless you wander around in a
  robe on a hunger strike, or unless you haul around a twenty foot cross each
  day because you're nailed to it, you don't owe these lumps of weasel shit a
  damn thing. Smiling and nodding, as you back away slowly, accomplishes
  nothing, and does not teach these people anything besides the now obvious
  fact that their behavior has no repercussions. I don't mean talk shit to the guy
  with a gun asking for your wallet, I mean lay down the law to the moron yapping
  on his cell phone in the public library.</p>
<p>This brings me back to the object of my obsession, Everquest. The fact is, WE
  THE NORMAL PEOPLE are the ones allowing the d00dz to exist. When we
  SoW them, give them armor and plat, teleport them, heal them, and laugh at
  their jokes, we contribute to their proliferation. When we respond to half
  literate tells, we give them the idea that "d00d, plz sow r ill get my freindz to
  kick ur @ss" is an acceptable way to address their evolutionary superiors.
  The choice as to whether or not you'll accept having your valuable play time
  fucked over by some mongoloid refugee from the Planet of Nut Jugglers is
  YOURS. The beauty of Norrath is that there's no fear of the no-life pissant
  pulling a gun on you. Here, you are free to tell off the dood and then ignore
  him. </p>
<p>Many of us play this game to escape a world in which we answer to people
  that are not as smart as we are. We play because here we have power, and
  control our own destinies. I call upon all my brothers and sisters who have
  recently read a book with no pictures to start asserting themselves against the
  infestation, because I'm sick and tired of the mouse poop in my taco. The
  virtual food court belongs to the humans, motherfucker. </p>
