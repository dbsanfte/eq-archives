<p>I'm not saying that my dog could play EQ, even if she did have an opposable thumb. Well, she could, but probably not past the tenth level. Tactics, timing, a sense of direction, and a basic knowledge of other classes and their skills are all required to play the game at its highest level. A real dumbass quickly makes a name for himself within his server community, and finds himself unwelcome on pickup raids.</p>
<p>But jesus humperdink christ, it's not fucking brain surgery, it's a video game. I think this "adults only" rating is unmitigated bullshit, because what this game needs isn't an age limit. We need a minimum IQ requirement. What seems like a learning curve to the rest of us is a goddam Himalayan peak to some of you.</p>
<p>You're fighting hill giants in Rathe Mountains. Basic powers of observation alert you to the presence of two groups camped in various safe spots. You, being the Stephen Hawking of Everquest, decide to locate your group at the base of the hill the giants spawn at, because gosh, that way you won't have to run very far to fetch something to hit. You are going to OWN the spawn, because everyone else has to run for at LEAST fifteen whole seconds to bring a giant to their group. And then you're surprised when another giant decides to take piece of your ass as you fight the first one? Earth to mongoloid, spawn points aren't safe camping spots!</p>
<p>So you move the group to an unoccupied piece of wall, after getting your ass reamed by all the melee players who just walked from the Arena without sow (and that one unfortunate warrior who forgot he was bound in High Hold). Time to pull! You run out and get a giant. Boy, it sure is tough typing "incoming," and making a hotkey would be way too difficult for someone of your brilliance. You arrive at the group, giant in tow, just to hear the shrieks of dismay from all the casters who have less than 20% mana. You must have majored in Communications, because it never once occurred to you to do a mana check. That Nobel Prize is in the mail.</p>
<p>Two hours later, it's time to try again. It would have been less than an hour, but the warrior told you to bend over and kiss your own ass, and he insisted on dragging one of the casters from your group to bind him in Arena. Oh, well, you've done a mana check and the gang is ready for action. You already figured out during your nine months of challenging caiman slaying that when you hit stuff, it runs faster than an unhit mob does. You see a giant, ambling along, occasionally stopping while spell effects go off around it. If someone else had it, it would be running FAST, so no one's agged it yet! You totally ignore the "frost" and "entwined in roots" messages, and start whacking at the giant. Jeez, it's awfully hard to make the giant turn to you! FINALLY it does and you bring it back to your group. You get the kill, and congratulate your wonderful group on great teamwork. Hardly anyone got hurt, the fight was over so fast! The moment is ruined when a druid comes running up to you and starts bitching you out for kill stealing. Go ahead, ask the guy for a SOW so you can pull more mobs, I dare you. Holy mother of John Smedley, you did. You asked the druid you pissed off for a SOW. Ladies and gentlemen, the crack babies of the 1980's have grown up, and they are playing Everquest.</p>
<p>I'd make fun of these dingbats for being confused by such intricate issues as pathing, the danger of wiping mobs you can't handle onto a class with feign, the side effects of healing a monk who has successfully feigned with four things standing over her head, etc., but that would get me in trouble with the gimps who do plane runs without grasping these basic concepts.</p>
<p>Come on, asshole. If you're too fucking incompetent to handle playing EQ, I'd hate to see you doing something as complicated as driving a car. Regardless, step away from the keyboard before you injure yourself with the sharp edges on the keys. It's for your own good, Einstein.</p>
