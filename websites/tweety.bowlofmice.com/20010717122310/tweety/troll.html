<p>What exactly is a troll? In fantasy novels, it's a large, somewhat stupid creature that rarely bathes with poor dietary habits. In Everquest, it's a big cuddly critter easily mistaken for a sea turtle roleplayed by people who are training for a job running a Muppet. In nursery rhymes, it's a bridge dwelling monster easily outwitted by goats.</p>
<p>And on message boards, it is a faceless demon with a sign reading "Ban Me" taped to its ass. Everyone knows you shouldn't feed the troll, and everyone does it. If in real life, you meet a troll, you ignore the moron and order another beer. But on a message board, everyone feels some bizarre compulsion to respond, to edify, to enlighten. Six dozen people take turns logically responding to the troll, and the troll responds to every post with some long drawn out manifesto from hell. When semantic nulls are removed from these documents, they boil down to "nuh uh, you stupid poo poo head." Anyone who has ever attempted to argue with a two year old or a congressman knows how futile the debate has become when the poo poo head pejorative has been unleashed. The only response to "nuh uh" is "shut up, you mouth breathing bottle baby before I go back in time and give your father a condom" and then everyone feels vaguely unclean.</p>
<p>But what is a troll? Well, one definition of troll is "one who posts an exaggerated version of his viewpoint to create a reaction." Color me green skinned and warty, baby, because I don't just do that on message boards, I have an entire website devoted to that kind of commentary. When I say that agitators shouldn't be banned, though, I'm not just trying to cover my own ass. Most board moderators, when pressed and slightly intoxicated, will admit to hoping their pet trolls continue hanging around. Nothing like a bull headed, obstinate, opinionated asshole on your forums to really drive up the traffic. I don't have a single person like that on my forums. I have a dozen of those people on my forums. Wouldn't lose them for the world, either. The world does not have so many smart and informed people that a board op can afford to chase any away. So, agitators can't be trolls, because no one really wants to ban them.</p>
<p>That sort of poster is usually frighteningly intelligent though. Maybe a troll is better defined as "a person who is not smart enough to realize when he is outclassed, and the sort of person who, if Galileo had put up an EZBoard, would have posted six hundred times with the message U SUX EARTH IS THE CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE." In all capital letters, that make me cry and mail people the caps lock key off my own keyboard. With a blinking sig file that takes two years to download. That links to a website with original MIDI file compositions. The problem with banning these people is the same problem the United States had when the Soviet Union filed for Chapter 11. When the members of the community do not have a common enemy, they turn on themselves. Not in any exciting displays of eating their young, either, but more of an endless bickering sort of thing. That's no fun at all.</p>
<p>So the belligerent asses and the single celled organisms get to stay. What about defining a troll as "one who persists in only expounding his point of view with a total refusal to even respond to others"? These trolls are spooky. They remind me of the nice guys who walk around my neighborhood on the hottest day of the summer wearing neckties and sincere expressions with wide open smiles. They look so clean cut, so happy, so content with their role in this world. And then you look in their eyes, and find emptiness. Like they're being programmed by IT. (Oh, come ON, you have to have read A Wrinkle in Time. You people are breaking my heart.) When you take pity on them and bring them inside to give them water, they start reciting the same speech likely used in brainwashing facilities. No deviance from the script is permitted, and they have been trained to use circular logic to redirect anything you say back to the script. Eventually you realize that their eyes aren't completely empty, that there still remains a spark of life and all that spark wants is to grind you down into accepting their worldview. And possibly to outfit you with borg implants. But these board habitués also serve a purpose. Everyone else, when posting, makes a conscious effort to not be as much of a narrow minded asshole as THAT guy. One empty eyed repetitive dickhead automatically makes everyone else on your board a better poster.</p>
<p>All right, we have to keep the jerks, the morons, and the children of the corn. Who's left to ban? Purveyors of foul language? Bah, there are some occasions where a good hearty expletive is the only true expression of emotion. People of questionable taste? One person's Rembrandt is another's Velvet Elvis. I could get ten strangers to agree on abortion faster than I could consistently define "tasteful." People who feel compelled to contribute to a discussion with "FIRST POST"? Now we're getting somewhere, but that might strike some people as too arbitrary.</p>
<p>Looks like I'm going to have to keep going with defining a troll as someone who uses racial epithets, open misogyny, and xenophobia to obscure the fact that he has no argument, no point, and no validity. Maybe my definition of troll is too narrow, but then again, when I first heard the Billy Goat Gruff story, I was rooting for the troll. Annoying little goat bastards were probably pissing over the side of the bridge just to see what would happen.</p>
