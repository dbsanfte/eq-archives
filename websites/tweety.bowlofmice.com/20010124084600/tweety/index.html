<p class="update">WEEKLY UPDATE - 1/22/01</p>
<p>What is superlative? Should a "best" rating or award connotate the best that a particular category has to offer, or does it represent the thing that has the least wrong with it? Does something get nominated for a prize because it's popular or because it has value?
<p>I'm not talking about EQ, either, I'm talking about the goddamn Golden Globe awards. I didn't pay any attention to them at all, but since Netscape so kindly offered me a nice link to a list of the nominees and the winners this morning, I clicked it. Jessica Alba was the only one nominated for an acting award from Dark Angel? What? Add it as a sign of the impending apocalypse, kids. She's the only one on that show who CAN'T act. I know I said earlier that she was getting better, and she is - now I only wince once or so every episode. She still can't act! We watch because she's like, hot and stuff. She kicks ass. Now, Michael Weatherly, he can act. And he's REALLY hot. But, it seems that the Fox network's official Hype Machine could only kick in for one cast member.
<p>Y'all do realize how entertainment products win awards, right? This includes sports figures, like the candidates for the Heisman Trophy. The sponsoring organization, be it a college or a movie studio, sends video clips and press kits to anyone who might be voting. It's called awareness building. But just as reporters tend to get their news from press releases because it's easier, so do award voters choose the candidate placed in front of them like a plate of food at a restaurant. Because thinking for yourself is work.
<p>Mutter. Think I'm ranted out, I'll catch you tomorrow. If you want some comedy, my other website interviewed Lum the Mad, and it should be going up sometime today.
<p>Remember, you're always free to email me with questions and comments.</p>
