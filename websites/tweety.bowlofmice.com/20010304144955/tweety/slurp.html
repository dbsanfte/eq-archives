<p>It started when I lived in a fraternity house. Everyone had a computer, and I was used to wandering around the house and see the boys engrossed in some silly game or another. If I had rolled my eyes any harder, I would have sprained them. The most popular pastime was a MUDD. All the guys played on the same one, and it was not uncommon for one boy to tear out of his room, run to another room, and shriek something incoherent like "You drunk motherhumper, you were supposed to turn left at the tower! You killed me! Move the fuck over, dickcheese, I'm playing you!" My favorite was "Hey, Bird, go to my computer and type colon s BRT, AFK2P." This was hollered at me through a bathroom door. Boy, college sure does impart class and civilization.</p>
<p>And then one day, the MUDD had PICTURES. Same incoherent screaming, same cries of dismay, same inability to get anybody off the computer for anything short of imminent nuclear annihilation.</p>
<p>Within a month, I finished all the grad school I could afford, and my best friend (the previously mentioned drunk motherhumper) finished college on the seven year plan. The two of us, along with two other buddies, said, gee, there are no jobs in Blacksburg, let's move to Northen Virginia. So we packed up, found a house, and moved.</p>
<p>The guys promptly networked the computers in the basement, and hopped on their MUDD-with-pictures, as I called it. (This was no surprise, by the way, these were the same guys who, while I unpacked the dishes, said they'd handle the living room. An hour after we agreed to do this, a sonic boom echoed from the living room. "Fuck," muttered one. "I knew we had that up too high." I emerged from the wonders of pot lids, and found them standing amidst a pile of destruction not unlike a trailer park in Kansas post-tornado. They had set up nothing except the couch, and they were taking turns sitting on it while the two males standing adjusted the surround sound speaker system.)</p>
<p>"Dinner!" I'd call out. Tumbleweeds rolled across the landscape. "Come help me with these grocery bags!" I'd shout from the front door. Crickets chirped. Once I set fire to something (by accident), and when the smoke alarm went off, I waited to see what would happen. Five minutes passed, at which point an unwashed male emerged from the basement, removed the smoke detector's battery, and went back into the lair.</p>
<p>There were other problems. I'd be trying to sleep, and suddenly "GODDAMMIT THE BASTARD GNOME TRAINED ME" would split the still night air. A social obligation to real life friends would arise, and I would get three promises to log off in "five minutes." An hour later, I'd come into the basement with smoke coming out of ALL my orifii, let alone my ears, and I'd get some lame excuse that wasn't even in English. I mean, come on, what the hell does "We were heading to the zone, but there was a total wipeout and CR is a bitch without supcamo and we don't have a monk" mean to normal people? Whatever! We now have less than ten minutes to beat the bride to the church!</p>
<p>Six months later, I was bored out of my gourd as the saying goes, playing Minesweeper. I was also bitching about the fact that the pool hall trip had been canceled in favor of "a king room raid" in "lower guck" that half the "guild" was going to go on. One roommate was out on a date that evening. I said, in passing, something about how the MUDD-with-pictures looked like it wouldn't be as complex to pick up as some other games I'd tried. Unwashed Male A looked at Unwashed Male B. "She'd hate being a caster, she's too impatient." Sage nodding. "She doesn't like dying too much though." More nodding. "She needs to start in Freeport, she'll probably get into those stupid ass tradeskills." You could practically see the light bulbs coming on over their heads. "MONK!" They swarmed over the absent male's computer, clicking buttons, and then I was faced with a picture of a revolving male. Click! Female.</p>
<p>I knew how to roll a character, I played Dungeons and Dragons. I put bonus points into charisma, a few into strength, and the rest into intelligence. I knew from experience that I had the most fun roleplaying that sort of character. I logged in. Seven hours later, the absent roommate arrived. "SLUUUUUUURP," he said.</p>
<p>The next day, another roommate was out somewhere, and I rolled another monk. I had discovered roleplaying was not really a factor in this "Everquest," so I poured points into the stats with the green highlights, thinking maybe these were important. Nine hours later, the owner of the computer came home. "SLUUUUUURP," he said.</p>
<p>The third roommate looked at me. "You aren't touching my computer with a ten foot pole." I looked at my machine. A Leading Edge IBM clone from 1986.</p>
<p>I tried very hard to sneak the big box past the roommates the next day, but it's sort of hard to unpack a computer, install extra memory, and wire it to a network without drawing some attention. The little box, I managed to sneak past them. I should probably have turned the speakers off before "Ba da ba DAAAAA, ba da BA da" came blasting over the system. There was much laughter, and no one remembered to eat dinner that night.</p>
