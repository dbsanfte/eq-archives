<p>I have not bothered to keep my old daily updates, mostly because the updates tend to be
   whatever fluff I happened to be thinking of at the exact second I was typing. I also figured all
   twelve of my readers would feel the same way. As it happens, I have at least seventeen loyal
   readers. I told myself I'd start saving the daily mental lint when I had more than five requests for
   old data, and the fifth came in yesterday. So starting with the update of 10/17, I'm going to toss
   updates here for anyone who cares.</p>
<p>Stuff older than 10/17 is lost forever. Since we're talking about a month and a half's worth of
   stuff, this is no great loss. If you need it, chances are decent I remember or still have the notes
   on paper, so write me.</p>  
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE: 12/13/00 - Dark Angel, Dark Age of Camelot, I like em both</p>
<p>Those of you who heard from me via email in the site's absence are probably rubbing your hands together, wondering what the rant against server hosts is going to sound like. I'm going to have to disappoint you, guys. As I've mentioned in other places, this domain is owned by a very good friend, who charges me a grand total of nothing for the space, maintenance, and consulting (meaning I turn around and holler at the guy at the desk behind me, "Goddammit, how do I make the font size bigger again?") So, there was a rant, but it involved me throwing empty cigarette packs at someone's head and making him watch Dark Angel with me.</p>
<p>I don't know what it is about that show - Jessica Alba couldn't act her way out of a wet paper bag. I keep telling myself, she's getting better, and she's awfully pretty….But I am COMPLETELY sucked in, week after week. Man, I want Logan so bad. What a hottie. And, oh yeah, there's like a plot and stuff. And the people on the show look like PEOPLE, not mannequins.</p>
<p>The mail bag is full! Lots of you had some great comments to make on my Mistmoore rant, in terms of WHY you check spoilers. A lot of it is "must-read" stuff for game developers, and I'll be putting up a "The Readers Speak" bit in a few days.</p>
<p>Speaking of game developers, some of you who are following my new gig at The Corporation know that I went to visit the peeps making Dark Age of Camelot. It looks real nice, y'all, I strongly suggest you addicts check their shit out. I think it was either Lum or a Lummie who described the game as "Everquest, without the parts that suck." If they can keep all the things we love about the Qrack (and there are many, or we wouldn't be sitting here yapping about it) and keep out the bits that create rant sites, it's going to be a heck of a game.</p>
<p>All right, that's enough for the day. Check out the rant on why I don't give a green goddam about The Children, to your right.</p>
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE: 12/12/00 - Back Up!</p>
<p>Merciful assmonkeys, my site is back up! It came home! The server is speaking to me again! That chicken I sacrificed to John Smedley pleased him! Um… okay. I'm just so damn happy it came back. You can all stop emailing me now, I did NOT quit my site. Let me finish some other stuff, and then I'll update the new rant, etc.</p>
<p>I kiss you, Mr. Domain Server! I kiss you! Don't leave me ever again!</p>
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE: 12/6/00 - Velious</p>
<p>So, Velious was released. I got a bird's eye view, no pun intended, when my two roommates loaded it up to play at the South Pole of our favorite virtual world. No maps, no cheaters, no quest spoilers, a brand new continent. They ran their little ogres and trolls over this brave new world, and it was so damn pretty. This isn't a review, so I'm not going into details, but I did notice one thing that was so damn funny, I had to share. At about 8 PM EST, the guys charged over a bridge shaped like a dragon skeleton (can I say wow here? WOW it was cool looking) and into a new zone. Right behind them was a mage, level 57. The first place the boys arrived at was a little orc camp. The 57 mage stopped there to kill an orc, and the guys ran on. It was a strike force, just checking out the scenery, whacking a monster, moving on to see more. Seven hours later, the guys were charging back to the zone with the druid ring, and passed the little orc hut again. The mage was STILL THERE. A brand new world to explore, quests to discover, and this dude picked the first camp he came to and didn't budge. Join me, brethren, in a big shout out - LAMER!!! Your mind is its own prison, dumbass.</p>
<p>Sure, on first glance the expansion has issues - your faction gets better and worse with the stuff you kill, but it doesn't tell you WHAT faction gets better and worse. A number of folks are still crashing to their desktops when they try to gate to the new world (gate, the self-only spell, not the teleport). But for crying out loud, last night was a blast in the Qrack. People helping each other, giving advice, discovering traps and quests, making random pickup groups strictly to explore… so why were people playing camp the safe spot in a game that wasn't yet twelve hours old? Mutter.</p>
<p>Today's tantrum is an old rant I actually wasn't planning to post, but it's relevant now, I think.</p>
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE: 12/4/00 - Tweety's a "reporter" now</p>
<p><b>Rant? Rant?! I got yer rant right here! Well, at the bottom of the mutating list of rants, anyway. I actually have several rants that I wrote over the weekend that I'll be posting this week at regular intervals.</b></p>
<p>Why the heck would I have to write backup rants? Well, see, somebody read my site and thought I knew something about games, people, and creative profanity. He and about a dozen people wrote to me offering jobs writing for their websites. I opted not to accept most of these offers, for several reasons - 1) Most of them wanted me to quit doing this site, ie, they weren't interested so much in me as my traffic. 2) They wanted to exhibit me like a chimpanzee, and I felt like I was regarded as Samuel Johnson's dancing bear. 3) Their sites didn't exist, but wouldn't it be cool if, blah blah. 4) Their site was similar in tone to my site, and I thought, gee, running a site can't be that hard, why should I join up with someone else who does all the hard stuff and lets me focus on having a good time?</p>
<p>On further reflection, #4 proves what many of you think, that I'm (say it with me) a dumbass.</p>
<p>But anyway. I did accept one of the offers, from this random wacko named Mr. Poppinfresh. He had several things going for him in his offer, namely free camels. Don't ask. He also didn't want me to quit my own site and drive my traffic to his, so it sounded like it was me the writer he was after, not Tweety the temporarily infamous banned guide.</p>
<p>So, starting tomorrow, I'm not just a big fucking whiner, I'm a big fucking whiner with a press pass. You can find me doing articles and game reviews <a href="http://www.corpnews.com"><span class="greenLink">over at The Corporation</span></a>. And I'll still be here, bitching and moaning, until that big vein in my forehead finally blows.</p>
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE: 12/1/00 - Nothing to see here, move along   
<p><b>Nothing's pissing me off today, sorry.</b></p>
<p>I tried to get annoyed, I really did. When I write the rants, I'm always teetering on a border between laughing hysterically and real true anger. When I'm really pissed off, I usually hold off on posting until I can see the glimmerings of humor in a situation, because I've discovered through feedback from all of you that I'm incoherent when I lose my sense of the ridiculous altogether.</p>
<p>Today, however, everything is just plain ridiculous. So, y'all have a good weekend, and stay out of the goddam shopping malls, they're bad for the soul. You're a computer geek, do your holiday shopping online or something.</p>
