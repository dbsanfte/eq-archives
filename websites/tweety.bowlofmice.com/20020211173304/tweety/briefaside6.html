<p>They say that youth is wasted on the young, but I believe that adulthood is wasted on the old.   
<p>You're finally old enough to buy beer, drive cars,  and those women on TV aren't your mothers age anymore, they're your age, or younger.  As for toys...remember that old line "You can have one action figure and that's all."...well now who's stopping you from buying the whole set?  I personally have almost completed my collection of wild things and I didn't even have to promise that I'd play with them.  In fact, I don't.  They just sit there and you know what?  I'm gonna buy more. 
<p>Who told you old farts not to play?  You remember how, try it.  It's ok to romp through the house wearing a cape.  It's all right to sing in the shower, and no one is going to call the cops if you turn the sound off on video games so you can make your own sound effects.  Your youth wasn't there to get it out of your system, it's there train you. You know how it's done, so stop being crusty and do it. 
<p>*** 
<p>I'm back to playing Everquest...if you couldn't tell by the lack of writing I've been doing.  So I think I'll take a moment to bitch about a few things I see in game. 
<p>First off...slang. Here's the rule: do it once, and you're making fun of it. Do it twice and congratulations!  You're a DOOD!  Enjoy the view from the land of ignored losers. Please enjoy the time you will now get to spend with the other "Dorfs, Droods, Crack Dealers, Rezzzzzzzers," and others that were funny the first time but now are merely failed experiments. 
<p>Other in-game tidbits: 
<p>Why do pet casters think the rest of the group gives a fuck about their pet? No I'm not gonna waste mana on him...he's cannon fodder. He's SUPPOSED to die. He's like the canary they take into coal mines, his primary function is to be the FIRST to die if possible. 
<p>Do I LOOK like I'm just dying to port you to great divide? I'm here for a reason.  When I want to leave I may take some non annoying people with me, but you've just been scratched off that list.  If I wanted to take you to a place I had no intention of going to, I probably would've said so when you spammed the zone with OOC stating your "need."  Stop bugging me.  You're the reason every other teleporting class in the zone is anonymous. 
<p>*** 
<p>The supreme court recently ruled that it is not unconstitutional for police to arrest, handcuff, and jail people for minor violations such as failure to wear a seat belt.  In the case at hand (a lady sued local government for arresting her in front of her kids, putting her in jail and having her pay $350 in bail for crime that carries a maximum penalty of $50, which she paid) there is no question that the crime was committed.  There was no question that the lady was in the wrong, and doing something stupid. 
<p>However, empowering local authorities to arrest people for minor violations is not only unconstitutional, but pretty much a text book example of the type of behavior the declaration of independence, if not the constitution was designed to avoid.   
<p>The vote was close, carried by the conservative justices on the court. 
<p>Here is why I will never be a republican, and almost never vote republican in spite of agreeing with most of what the republican party "claims" it stands for.  They love to jump on soap boxes and talk about less government control, then immediately jump on party lines to empower the government any and everytime the environment or gun control isn't involved. 
<p>I give it four months until the supreme court gets to hear a case about a black man being arrested for jaywalking.  Of course they will "find" crack on him later...good thing they thought to arrest him... 
<p>The ruling will undoubtedly stand until a hunter is arrested for failing to carry proper certification for his rifle.  Then I imagine it will only be a matter of weeks before they over turn it. 
<p>I think if either political party ever actually decided to stand for what they claim to stand for, the whole country might just spontaneously combust out of shock. 
<p>*** 
<p>Dear landlord, 
<p>I've recently been preparing to move into my new residence.  The place (formerly condemned) has been fixed up nicely, leaving me only to paint the walls and lay some tile, as per our agreement.  In the process of working, I have however, discovered that the home is seated on the ancestral, if not native, homeland of several species of arachnid.  I have commenced a systematic eradication of the various species. 
<p>Through the course of my offensive, I have been named, by many of these native cultures, as something of an evil deity.  I fear I must continue my efforts and obliterate them completely or face the possibility that the survivors might band together to overthrow my evil regime. 
<p>My efforts continue tomorrow.  Should I vanish unexpectedly, know that I have failed in my task and you are advised to proceed with the napalm. 
<p>Honor and truth, 
<p>~A 
<p>*** 
<p>I really hope social security manages to survive.  I think I may eventually need it to pay off my student loans. 
<p>***
<p>Am I really the only person in America who thinks Doonesbury sucks even more than Ally McBoring?  The damn thing just wont die.  Sure it got demoted to political cartoon status on the page only people like my Dad and those of us wanting to look intelligent in front of other people ever read, but the thing is still there.  Kill it! Kill it! 
<p>***
<p>Robert Downey jr. Got embarrassed today for doing something bad. Hollywood, outraged by unscrupulous behavior was shocked and dismayed. 
<p>The rest of us just got a good laugh about the irony of that.  To me it's kind of like when everyone acted shocked and outraged when they found out the president had actually lied to us.   
<p>Still...something should be done.  We in America do NOT stand for prominent figures in society to behave in unscrupulous ways. 
<p>*** 
<p>Can you believe I managed to type that entire aside without cracking a smile?  I may make it into congress after all.  I haven't sold out yet, but I'm going cheap...better hurry if you want to buy my vote. 
<p>***
<p>Tweety told me she actually knows the guy who got in trouble for trying to sell his vote on Ebay.  I hope he reads her page (and in turn, this one) because I wanted to take a moment to salute him. A true American hero. Possibly the last honest person in America. 
<p>Personally, I sell my vote in a dark alley just down the street from one of the New York Senators, but most people I know use conference rooms. Going to public auction is a bit too honest for my taste, but I salute your openness. 
<p>A brief but heartfelt round of applause. 
<p>(all kidding aside: that was classic, I'd lobby for a holiday for you if I hadn't already sold my vote to wellcat.com for their "Eat Everything You Want Day") 
<p>((And no...I'm not kidding.))
<p>*** 
<p>KULL THE CONQUEROR! 
<p>Starring Kevin Sorbo. 
<p>Anyone seen this piece of dung?  If you haven't yet, I will enlighten you. 
<p>This movie sucks.  Bad acting, weak story, fourth rate writing, second rate fight scenes, more anachronisms than your local renn faire (but not as much as Xena). 
<p>I LOVED it!  Definite must see.  No bones about it.  No pretentious holier than thou 'you must care about because it's art' crap...just good quality filler to play in the background of our descent as a civilization. 
<p>Kevin Sorbo is likable and buff, the girls are all good looking and savvy, the villains are suitably stupid.  Two thumbs up.  It reminded me of Conan the destroyer, only Kevin Sorbo was actually allowed to say more than 'grunt'.  A little nudity would have been nice, but then, we can't have everything can we? 
<p>*** 
<p>Sometimes, when writing this column, I can't even tell when I'm being serious or not.  If it helps clarify things: I actually do own a copy of Kull the Conqueror. 
<p>(We at brief asides are horribly ashamed of this fact.)
<p>*** 
<p>NEW TOY!!! 
<p>Darth Maul has been overthrown as the official 'coolest office decoration!"  I have recently become the proud owner of a brand new set of Wild Things collectible action figures.  Yes, as in "Where the Wild things Are."  The only two I am missing are Max, and the one that looks like he's wearing a sweater.  Darth Maul still gets to hang around, but he's been demoted to the same shelf the X-men action figures reside upon.  The Wild 
Things get the place of honor now. 
<p>If you have the means, I recommend purchasing a set of your own.   
<p>If you see a Max (or the one who looks like he's wearing a sweater) hands off please...he's mine. 
<p>***
<p>Here's a small hint about what I look like. 
<p>Hair salons.  Why do people who work in hair salons always seem to have the worse hair cuts in the universe? Do any of you cut hair for a living?  If so...ARE YOU FUCKING BLIND?  Have you never looked in a mirror and realized that the only people who come in asking for your hair cut are too ugly to visit the zoo? 
<p>SO, I cut my own hair.  It's wavy and pretty much has a mind of its own anyway so there's a good margin for error.  Sometimes it works out, sometimes not. 
<p>So I finally got to stop wearing the hat this week.  It's a good feeling, but I noticed, that in time waiting for my "errors" to grow out, that I've gained a few grays.  I don't really mind the gray, in fact I like it, it goes well with my dark hair, but why does it seem to be made of an entirely different substance than the rest of my hair? 
<p>It's slightly annoying.  Thank God the 'messed up' look is coming back.  It's always nice to time your fashion mistakes with the general lack of taste society likes to get into. 
<p>***
<p>NO MORE FOR YOU.
