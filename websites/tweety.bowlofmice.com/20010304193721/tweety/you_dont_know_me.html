<p>"The right thing to do would be to apologize to Mystere and re-instate his account. George Scotto especially owes an apology for his "we don't want your type of person playing EQ" statement, implying that Mystere was a sick person in real life. (-Xhen, on Lum's message board.)</p>
<p>Over and over, George Scotto and other Verant employees have gone on record during the Mystere debacle either implying or outright saying that Mystere was a sick fuck who didn't belong in the family friendly EQ environment. Now that the fur has stopped flying, I'm left with a nasty taste in my mouth from those statements that won't go away, no matter how much the new kinder and gentler Smed flaps his gums.</p>
<p>Who am I? Well, if all you've read is the Try Being a Guide rant, you assumed I'm an angry, frustrated, foul-mouthed person on the verge of serious postal behavior. If you only know me from EQ and related message boards, then you think I'm a mellow person who only gets riled when my friends are under attack. If you read my fiction, you probably think I'm a fairly unimaginative person with a really good vocabulary. If you read message boards and not my site, you apparently think I'm MALE. </p>
<p>None of you know me. None of you have any right to pass judgment on me as a human being. Because I have a website, and I was well known on my play server, you are all welcome to criticize my online persona, as well as my ideas and the way I state them. But you cannot judge ME. To assume that any one of the facets revealed through my writing is the sum total of who I am as a person is to become prey to one of the worst fallacies ever engendered by the internet. Only a complete moron would read a short story, or a single rant, and think they've identified a person's defining trait. </p>
<p>I have always thought that the EQ phenomenon took Verant much too far, much too fast. It was obvious from the very beginning that they were unprepared for the sheer number of customers that would descend on them. Furthermore, they didn't anticipate the attachment that people would form to their virtual belongings, friends, and personas. What you have is a company (a very small company) who still doesn't realize the impact that their decisions have. They consistently behave as though they were the administrators of a text MUDD with an insignificant user base. The sweeping displays of managerial arrogance and the willingness to screw with long established game mechanics are all familiar to anyone who ever played a MUDD. It's just that in EQ simple banning, a simple weapon adjustment, affects literally thousands of people. Yet Scotto, Abashi, Michelle, Brad, Smed - they all seem so surprised when something they say creates a backlash. It's as if they're riding a tiger, hanging on to the ears for dear life - but in their hearts they're still plodding along on a pony.</p>
<p>Back to the point: The sheer arrogance and ignorance of assuming that because a story has violence, the writer must be violent is appalling. It wouldn't be so frightening from an eleven year old. While I was working on my Master's degree in education, I was taught that it isn't until around an average of age twelve that humans learn to not be so literal. This is why games like EQ aren't suggested for children. While a younger child will be able to tell you that dragons aren't real and understand that stories are made up things, that same child still isn't intellectually ready to make the distinction between the angry text on their screen and the human being behind the keyboard. We've all lost our tempers when someone is an asshole in game, but adults are able to move on, and chuckle about the incident. A child remains hurt, and unhappy. And a child assumes that because someone said something yucky, that someone must also be yucky. </p>
<p>Let me be perfectly clear. A child can read a horror novel, and realize that it didn't really happen. That same child hasn't yet matured intellectually, however, and will be a little scared of the horror novelist. Does everyone now understand what is so pathetic about <a href="/tweety/kimberly_speaks.html"><span class="greenLink">Kimberly's recount of her conversation with Mr. Scotto</span></a>? He and everyone who contributed to the decision to ban Mystere are functioning on the level of your average preteen. Poor Mr. Scotto - he was caught on record making those agitated comments, and the situation blew up and lowered the veil of silence on Verant before we could find out who else at Verant is still wondering about the mysteries of puberty.</p>
<p>How dare you assholes judge Mystere on the basis of a few stories? How dare you run a company and make decisions with no information or investigation? </p>
<p>How dare you think you know who I am?</p>
