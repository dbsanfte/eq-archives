<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE: 10/28/00 - Hokies ball, being colorblind</p>
<p>The Hokies did it again! This time, a victory was pulled from the ass of defeat. Gotta hand it to the backup quarterback Meyer - that rabbity looking white boy knows when he's outclassed and does the best he can, no heroics or attempts to be something he's not. We're fucked for next week if Vick forgot to learn how to speed heal, though, Miami consists of a bunch of big tough bastards.</p>
<p>It's funny, but only twenty or thirty years ago, it was commonly held that black men couldn't do a good job at quarterback. Coaching and other types of leadership were white only. Now, an entire stadium full of people start chewing Rolaids like they were Pez when the white boy takes the field. It's great that perceptions can change, and the world is better for it. Better still is the online gaming world - where the skin color/sexuality/gender/religion of the player never has and never will matter. With that in mind, back to your regularly scheduled weekend.</p>
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE: 10/27/00 - PVP updates and clarifications</p>
<p>It's Friday, so I don't really care much about anything, but here's a few updates and clarifications.</p>
<p>Predictably, I got some email on the PVP/PK rant - but the subject matter wasn't predictable at all. A few thank-yous from PVP types who appreciated not being lumped in with the pimplebutts with dick envy. One nasty letter from someone who considers himself a PK, but after he went and read the rant he realized I called his type of player a PVP. I had a long talk with him, and he wanted everyone to know the term I meant instead of PK was actually "grief PK." All righty then. Now we know.</p>
<p>The vast majority of my mail, however, was from various peeps heavily into PVP talking about THEIR game. Um… from now on, please state your planet of origin when writing me long emails at three in the morning without punctuation. I did get one extremely intelligent email from Sakhmeth, talking about his next game. Read his Horizons clarification <a href="/tweety/sakhmeth.html"><span class="greenLink">here</span></a>. Please, space aliens, note his style and communication skills. I have always cleaned up spelling and grammar before I published guest material, but I do not speak Klingon.</p>
<p>I'm working on getting some information from the Dawn guys for y'all that have sent in questions, but unless they answer email better than Verant, there are no guarantees.</p>
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE 10/26/00 - Banned for IP addresses</p>
<p>The response to the newest round of suspensions on Whineplay is pretty funny. (Lum's has the story if you're a little out of it.) People all squealing about what Verant can and can't do via IP addresses.</p>
<p>At the moment, I have two things to say - one, I've been getting somewhat cryptic email from one of the folks directly involved for a few days now, so no, this wasn't invented by those evil beings at Lumcorp. And two, yes, Virginia, Verant CAN track you (or someone they think is you) by IP.</p>
<p>When I first started this site, I got my very own hallmark of success - a hatemailer. While this person had a throwaway email account, I have every reason to believe that this individual either worked for Verant as an employee or a volunteer. According to the sad sack with nothing better to do but harass a ranter, I got nailed because someone compared the IP for my first Tweety post on an EZBoard with the IP on a post I made to the guide board. They then looked at my guide account, figured out what my primary player character was called, and whisked me out of a Vox raid to interrogate me in an exitless room in the Qeynos catacombs. (That attempt at intimidation was funny - what, was I supposed to feel trapped and break into tears?) The loser writing the hate mail implied that he/she/it was the one who compared the IP addresses and blew the whistle on me.</p>
<p>So, my dear ones, think before you say it can't happen. (Update! They got banned, and unbanned - <a href="/tweety/banned_for_not_posting.html"><span class="greenLink">check it out</span></a>).</p>
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE: 10/25/00 - Intro to PVP rant</p>
<p>The two points in my last rant go to Raver, who correctly identified the quote as coming out of the mouth of Robert Heinlein's Mama Maureen. She gets the two points, ahead of the more accurate Moonflea, because I had Mama Maureen in mind when I wrote it down. Moonflea, however, points out that Maureen was quoting Mark Twain. So basically I'm a belligerent fuckup, c'est la vie.</p>
<p>Today's hissy fit is on everyone's favorite topic, PVP. Why does everyone confuse the concept of PVP with that of the saddest unevolved critter of the gaming world, the player killer? And why does everyone belabor the issue about the solution being in game design, as if designers were these mythical beings filled with wisdom and light? The only game designer I ever met was a huge stoner with delusions of grandeur. He could do remarkable things with pixels. He could also belch the alphabet after chugging a forty of 8-Ball. This was not enough to leave me with the idea that game designers are omnipotent.</p>
<p>There's quite a little thread going on my board on the topic already. Of course, they started it in the "What will you play next" thread, so if anyone wants to discuss this, please make a new topic. The thread the current debate is in also has the poll, and it's a bitch for some people to load. Oh, and by the way, Yanger and Goe, I agree with you both. And neither of you. Love ya, mean it.</p>
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE: 10/24/00 - Dawn comments</p>
<p>Kudos to Moonwhisper, who was the brave soul to be the first to offer her work up in the new writer's forum in the Nest O' Freaks. It's a very good story, too, offering some background color on barbarian history. Y'all will notice I didn't have the cajones to put my own story up to bat in the first inning! So go check out the guidelines, and add something to the mix, you crazed intellectual animals.</p>
<p>Someone sent me the link to the Dawn website, a currently vaporware MMORPG for hard core RP types. For those of you muttering about EQ having no real roleplay, put your balls where your mouth is and sign up for the beta. They're trying to get 10K people for the beta, and taking everyone who sends an email.</p>
<p>I have my doubts about this game for two reasons. One, permadeath. Two, you have to be "born" to an existing female who had (offscreen) sex thus indicating her willingness to be pregnant for a week of game time. Go <a href="http://www.glitchless.com"><span class="greenLink">check them out</span></a> if you're curious. Be warned, I couldn't get it to open in Netscape, had to use IE. Download the 6 MB storyline movie if you have the time, it took me just under ten minutes with an ISDN connection.</p>
<p>What the crackheads infesting their boards are missing is that while it's true people are willing to risk their real lives over the damndest things, a character is more like a wine collection or a intricate oil painting you created - it's something that you POSSESS more than you ARE, unless you're obsessive. I would never attack a dragon in real life, whereas my character would, simply because she can't really die. I can and will take risks as a character I would never consider in real life. It looks like a truly <a href="/tweety/immersive.html"><span class="greenLink">immersive</span></a> RP experience, and for that I give them credit. But I crapped out on UO because I made the fatal error of trying it several months after release, and was totally unable to level up high enough to get past the "PK bait" point. I swear, there were people who waited at my camp point just so they could kill me within two seconds of logging in.</p>
<p>Nothing really new to bitch about today. Move along, nothing to see here.</p>
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE: 10/23/00 - Renn Faires and sexual politics</p>
<p>That whole clusterfuck on Lum's last week was bizarre, eh? If you can't figure out why I didn't post on the topic while everyone else was, you've obviously not run a website in which any schmuck with serious issues can email bomb you. I felt like I should wait until everyone involved had finished their rabies inoculations. But the topic buried under the thread from hell bears consideration, and I'm hoping everyone's had enough time to calm down so we can discuss it rationally.</p>
<p>I attend every RennFaire I can afford to. I usually wear a doublet that laces all the way up to my neck, breeches, the usual bells and whistles of a medieval costume, and a long black cape. I haven't worn the St. Pauli girl outfit (it's a beer label, for you adolescents out there, with a picture of a chick in a go-go-gadget TITS bustier) in years because I cannot deal with middle aged ninnies in need of a shower coming up to me and saying "Hail, fulsome wench! I seem to have lost my purse in a dark valley - may I search for it wink wink?" In my "male" costume, I get the same ninny, only he's friendly, respectful, and talks a little shop on where we got our costume pieces. He's still aware that I'm female, but he talks to ME, not the nipples. It's not that I can't take care of his disrespect with one well placed kick, it's that I infinitely prefer the second persona to the first. The point is, why can't I have that respect in a dress? Why do I have to hide my "wench" persona just to enjoy a day at the fair without feeling uncomfortable? I like eye-candy. I even enjoy BEING eye-candy. How this all relates to RPGs is to your right.</p>
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE: 10/22/00 - Intro to new rant on feeling secure online</p>
<p>Go Hokies! Syracuse put a scare into us, briefly, but OUR quarterback opted to score a touchdown instead of ignoring the open receiver, neener neener neener. Player of the game should have been Lee Suggs, though - that boy made like a goat and butted his way into first downs like taco sauce through a dysenteric soldier. Now that I'm done mixing metaphors, you may carry on.</p>
<p>A few weeks back, when Tweetyrants first got started, a loyal reader sent me the link to <a href=http://bitch.shutdown.com><span class="greenLink">The Misanthropic Bitch</span></a> website. I disagree with a bunch of her positions (me being a knee jerk liberal nutcase and all)(/wink), but all of her rants crack me up. Don't even bother clicking the link if you don't have a few hours to kill. She doesn't update very often anymore, but the archives are some seriously classic rants. One of her "fans" said that people have the right to feel safe online. Many gamers (more often female than not, although both genders are represented) have said the same. Do they? I wonder… commentary to be found on the right.</p>
<p>Random thought: Does anyone else wonder what a convention of rant site editors and writers would look like? Someone (i.e., not ME) should put a gathering together. Don't forget to invite me.</p>
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE: 10/20/00 - Sucked into System Shock 2</p>
<p>Sorry I didn't pop in to say hello, yesterday. I was busy killing hybrids and hacking into security crates to get more cyber modules.</p>
<p>Yes, that's right. I, hater of first person shooters, virgin to all video games but EQ, have fallen from grace. I've been sucked into System Shock 2. First of all, I NEED the soundtrack to this puppy. Yowsers. Second of all, I've been in EQ situations that got my heart to thump, but I have never had the SHIT scared out of me like SS2 does. Shudder. I really, really suck at the combat parts, though. The puzzles are no problem, but I can't seem to react fast enough when I'm getting the crap beat out of me. Also, I was using the famous EQ combat style, which is to say I got up close and whacked at the monster. According to the website I found, that's bad. Instead, I should watch the weapon in the monster's hand, and get in close AFTER he swings, and scurry back when he swings again. Realistic combat? What else might be in store? I have no idea, because I don't have the instruction manual these games usually come with. And finally, the whole game is amazing. I'm always low on ammo, always looking over my shoulder, always a little bloody. It's like they set out to design paranoia.</p>
<p>All that annoyed me is the same thing that annoys me about all these fucking games. The disembodied voices, be they the trainers or the chick who's helping me, all assume I'm a male. What is it with these asshole designers who all assume that "if player=female then game=Barbie's Makeover Kit"? I don't want anyone to design a "female-friendly game," because other people's conception of female friendly invariably produces a product I need insulin to look at, with all the sugary sweet bows and pink things. You'd think these guys never noticed the girls in their high schools wearing black and going to Metallica concerts. All I'm asking is that the programmers design the game they want to design, and then remove any assumptions that the player is male. And if you MUST toss in eye candy, add a few males in tight leather pants.</p>
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE - 10/18/00 - My take on Absor</p>
<p>Okay, okay, I got the link. Stop sending me email to tell me that Absor wrote an editorial about me back when I first put up the site. I appreciated it, since I hadn't seen it, but no more.</p>
<p>Attempting to incite me to flame is pointless anyhow, since I doubt the fellow has ever checked this site past that day, and I've been told reading my site at Verant HQ is a no-no. I've also yet to flame anyone for disagreeing with me in a logical manner. He didn't say anything wrong. He said plenty I <b>disagreed</b> with, especially the bits about working within a system (earth to Absor, um, don't you think I tried?), but he wasn't wrong. I flipped my lid. I was flattered at the idea of having a website and accepted a friend's offer to have one made up for me. It's not like he said I kick puppies. Last I checked, people were allowed to disagree with each other.</p>
<p>Absor's only blind spot is he's a roleplayer first, a player second. Notice I didn't say "weakness," I said "blind spot." He may not realize what the player base actually consists of. I could also wish there was a requirement in place to insure he checked sites besides Whineplay to get a feel for the community, but since I don't know what he's supposed to do I don't plan to have an opinion.</p>
<p>Is he a VAK? Who cares? The only way the players would believe the new person wasn't a VAK would if they hired me, Buur, or Lum. And monks will be the Masters of Melee before that happens. I won't blame the guy for taking the job at any rate, since most would be writers would have. "You want to pay me? For my hobby? Really?" If I feel anything, it's jealousy that he landed such cushy job.</p>
<p>There's a thought! Hey, game developer person! Call me, baby!</p>
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE - 10/17/00 - Buh bye, Abashi, Riftwar Saga reference</p>
<p>EVENING OF 10/17 - Yowsers. I thought this was important enough to make a rare evening update. The Coachman posted this link to my message board, so check it out. This could mean a whole lot of ugly things, because if you can define "defamation of character," or "harm to a business" and then make a comment in a chat room apply to either definition, it's a matter of time before any comment made over the internet can be stretched to fit that same definition. Now, back to today's update already in progress.</p>
<p>You know, I never had a problem with Abashi. Once I read a few comments and peered at the org chart, I figured he was just a mouthpiece. The only thing I wondered was "Does he really exist, or is Abashi the username of whatever temp Verant hires to read Whineplay?" All this "promotion" tells me is that there was a man behind the Sock Puppet (TM by Drysart). He made no decisions, he didn't have his own banning stick, he just ran his mouth on a forum visited by a very few lunatics. The guides generally loathed him, because we'd get an influx of really stupid petitions every single time he posted about in-game customer service. Aside from that, though, I never saw what there was to hate. It's not like any of the crap he spewed ever originated with him. I concurred with Lum's assessment (get this cretin off the front lines) only because the poor puppet had no grasp of the power of words and used them poorly.</p>
<p>After reading my intended rant yesterday, I realized it sucked and didn't bother to post it. Got a different one over to your right. Not so much a rant as food for thought.</p>
<p>Thanks again to all the people who leaped to supply me with Raymond Feist's name. I read most of the Riftwar books a while ago, loved them all, and then moved away from the roommate who owned them. They reminded me a little of Clavell's Asian Saga, dunno why.</p>
<p>In other news, I'm fixing the link titles so y'all reading this behind firewalls written by freaked out preschool teachers can get to the bits with BAD WORDS in them. The rants haven't changed, just the file names.</p>
