<p>We're stalled at 17 sick puppies. I am relieved, yet I feel a sense of disappointment. Guess that twisted reaction proves I'm a girl, and no, Mr. Just Asking, I will NOT post a picture of my tits to prove it.</p>
<p class="yellow">Question: Why do you call it the "weekly" update when you have something new every day?</p>
<p>I thought I covered this, but it might have been in an old update. I know a few people who run websites, some about things besides gaming even. They tell me that after awhile, people start to feel entitled to daily updates. This website is something I do for fun and as an outlet for repressed angst, and the minute I feel like I have to do it I'm off like a prom dress. Having "weekly" stated as my intended frequency, I'm free to update as often or as rarely as I damn well feel like it. It takes effort to get as pissed as I do, and occasionally I wake up in too good a mood to bitch.</p>
<p class="yellow">Question: I recently downloaded a great product called EQ macros. It allows me to use a web browser while in EQ!! I am a druid, and as I normally don't have enough time to port to a dungeon and get going in a group, I spend most my time kiting.  While I sit and med for about 6/7 minutes after a fight (thanks Vision), I would love the opportunity to browse the web and or post to message boards.  The only problem is the creator of this little program (which I found out about on Lum The Mad's site FYI) posted a warning that the program was illegal and you could be banned for its use, how likely is it that the guides could tell I'm using it?</p>
<p>There's no way a guide will be able to tell if you're using it. None. A guide is a player just like you, sitting at home, with only a few extra commands (/goto, /summon, /who (which when typed by a guide brings up your station name and ID number)). Guides have no access to logs, player histories, anything. You would have to TELL a guide you were using it for them to know.  As for a Verant employee, I don't know for certain. If you were to call and request technical help, they might be able to "look" at your machine and find out if you have it loaded. I think it's safe, though. I know several people who used ShowEQ the entire time they played and never got caught, just by being smart enough to NEVER EVER refer to it while they played, not even a cute allusion.</p>
<p>Someone else asked for my opinion of EQMacros, ethically speaking. Honestly, this program is just an automated version of the things you can do already. With a paper map and a /loc hotkey, I always know where I am. This program just makes it convenient. And as for the web browser - woo the hell hoo. Being able to hit Allakhazam's AND play? Yippee! ShowEQ is a cheat because it gives you information you wouldn't otherwise have. EQMacros is like using a pocket calculator instead of a pencil.</p>

At some point in your Guiding career (if you haven't several dozen times already!), you're more than likely to encounter petitioners who require information regarding the banning or suspension of their account. The following e-mail address has now been activated as part of the never-ending process of improving Customer Service! Please write it down or add it to your existing list of Customer Service phone numbers and addresses. <br><br>

This address is ONLY for inquiries regarding bannings and suspensions. For other customer service and billing related questions, customers should be directed to the "Contact Us" link on the www.everquest.com webpage, where they should click on "Account Services" for easy-to-use forms. Customers may also contact the Station and Verant customer service department by phone at the following numbers: <br>

<p>Tweety here: UM. There is no legal way for a petitioner to contact a guide in game if they've been suspended or banned. Morons. They did have the sense to put the email address on the main EQ page as well. Thanks again to the various guides, keep those updates coming! I'm already banned, I'll post anything!</p>
<p class="yellow">Question: Why are guides ever UN-anon? If we aren't supposed to send them tells, why would they ever let us know they're there?</p>
<p>Because customers generally like the feeling that they aren't pouring their submissions into an empty hole. Most people want to be able to see that someone from customer service is actually reading their petitions. Also, most guides don't mind answering quick questions - it's problems that guides can't solve without a petition.</p>
<p class="yellow">Question: I'd like to ask about Verant's policy towards non-english players. Do they support other languages through the guide program or is it as I suspect: "do as best as you can with what you got". I sometimes think Verant may be marketing different "cultural" markets without taking the proper steps to deal with the differences that brings to the game. How are foreign players treated within the guide program?</p>
<p>There is no policy towards non-english speaking players, per se. Your suspicion is correct - we do the best with what we've got. Most of the guides, I believe, are like me - try as hard as you can, and then give up and type /ooc Anyone here speak English AND (insert language here)? Many of the foreign-based guilds have a member who speaks English well, and that person sends the petitions, etc. While it is technically against the rules for one person to petition on behalf of others, I always made exceptions for these people. Mostly, guides do what I'm doing right now - speak as clearly as possible, and avoid idiomatic American English. I doubt more will be done, because the game is American in origin. I do know, though, that Verant is making more of an effort to hire guides from overseas, who will then be able to help the players who log in after most of the US population has gone to bed. Well, most, except for the kids on plane raids that have gone to hell.</p>
<p class="yellow">Question: Why does it take so long to get helped, when I see 16 guides online? How long should I wait before I send a tell?</p>
<p>When you see THAT many guides on, your wait is going to be even longer than normal, because one of two things is happening. Either an all hands meeting of every guide on the server, or it's newbie guide training day. Either way, the guides are not taking petitions for roughly half an hour. If it's newbie guide day, then you'll start getting help very soon, as soon as they are taught how to take petitions. Each petition takes forever, because the new guide is repeating everything you say to a more experienced guide in order to learn the ropes. Be patient - your server just got a fresh infusion of new enthusiastic blood, and that only means good things in the future. PLEASE DON'T SEND THEM TELLS. </p>
<p class="yellow">Question: What can I do, besides not cheating, to increase the odds of a guide helping me? Does kissing ass help?</p>
<p>No, kissing ass doesn't help. Sheesh. Being clear, literate, concise, and polite - now, THAT helps. And accepting that your answer might be "no" increases your odds of that same guide being more willing to hear you out next time.</p>
<p class="yellow">Comment: As one of the people who contributed to the guidelines you mentioned in your CS in the Planes rant, I wanted to tell you that the big reason for guides not being there is that their mere presence, should they go linklead, is enough to train (and kill) every raider in the zone.</p>
<p>I paraphrased the nice guy who wrote to me, just in case his writing style was recognizable to the assholes lurking near. I wanted to make sure everyone got a chance to see his comment, because it's something I didn't make clear in my original hissy fit. My rant was not meant as a "those stupid guides" thing, I was trying to express my contempt for a game designer who would allow that situation to be a possibility. So, listen up - if a guide doesn't rezz you in the planes, it's because the cure could be worse than the disease, so to speak. Any other guides/seniors/actual game designers out there, please feel as free as this guy did to write to me and correct any errors I might make. I believe that accurate information makes for a better relationship between players and guides, and I'm not going to bust you for sharing.</p>
