<p>You know something interesting is going on when you see the server GM, a player,
  and three guides standing around some remote location. You can almost hear the
  music - NA NA NA NAAA, NA NA NA NAAAAA, HEY HEY HEY,
  GOODBYE.......Somebody is going on a little vacation from Everquest. Why?
  Because someone on this horribly understaffed server finally had the time to count
  the warnings on a certain account. TWELVE? Well, shit, maybe he's gotten his
  second chance already, you think?</p>
<p>Nobody cries when this little psychopath is given his walking papers. In the old days,
  when the name of someone banned was broadcast across the universe, people
  would cheer and send petitions reading THANK YOU. That is, until the d00ds
  started spamming. "Y did u ban Shitforbrains? he wuz nice." "U st00pid GMs r gona
  p@y 4 this." "he was just kidding, u assh*les alwayz hated him 4 NO good reazon."</p>
<p>Get this straight - in all the time I've been a tool of the man, our server has NEVER
  banned anyone without a good goddam reason. Shitforbrains, all incarnations, was
  an exploit using, cheating, nasty, guide abusing prick, and deserved everything he
  got, every single time. What did YOU do to get a permanent vacation?</p>
<p>CHEAT. By this I mean cheat the players. Before they changed the /consent
  function, you would get consent for some poor schmuck, loot everything they had,
  and log out. Beign able to loot a fallen comrade so he wouldn't lose his gear along
  with his corpse was handy, but not anymore. I logged in one day, and you cheating
  cocksuckers had managed to ruin the day of TEN DIFFERENT PEOPLE. This
  game doesn't take BRAINS, it takes time. And you fucked somebody out of up to a
  year of work. So now all the honest players are fucked as far as /consent, because
  we can't catch all of you.</p>
<p>LIE. I love the lotteries. I think it's a clever fundraising tool, and most everyone
  enjoys gambling of some kind. YOU, sausage slammer, would collect the money,
  and then long out with it. You usually had an innocent partner who would then be left
  standing there while the hive went insane.</p>
<p>EXPLOIT. You perched in one of the infamous spots, you slaughtered things at no
  risk to yourself, and you told the guide who catches you to fuck off. I'm not there to
  argue ethics with you. What you are hurting are the people who want to hunt
  whatever critter, and you're killing them all, since you need no downtime to recover.
  What you are hurting is the group you will one day destroy because you leveled past
  your skill and your knowledge of the game. What you are hurting is the game, which
  is so precariously balanced it looks like Jabba the Hutt standing on tiptoe at the top
  of a flagpole. What you are doing is MISSING THE POINT, you sadsack
  delinquent. If all you want to do is kill stuff without getting hurt, go buy a first person
  shootemup and put in the cheater god codes. Wimp.</p>
<p>DUPE. If your knowledge of economics is so vague that you can't figure out how an
  extra million plat appearing out of nowhere MIGHT FUCK THINGS UP, please
  leave. I didn't realize your lobotomy allowed you to type, but live and learn, that's my
  motto.</p>
<p>TRAIN. KS. VULCH. Here's a newsflash, loser - the guides are players. Most of
  us are high level players. We know the game better than you do, since we actually
  play it. We can tell the difference between deliberate and accidental training. We
  know what things you and your class can solo. And when you say things like
  "Hehehehe, i think ur hot" when I ask for your side of some KS tempest in a toilet, I
  get the sneaking feeling you might be an asshole.</p>
<p>SPAM THE ZONE WITH SLURS. Call me a liberal, call me a bleeding heart, but
  don't call me a kike, a nigger, a faggot, or a cunt. Or a dozen other things that mark
  you as a subhuman, ignorant child. Don't call other people those names either. And
  don't do it in open channels, because believe or not, your mother was special. She's
  the only one in history who had an abortion that lived. </p>
<p>My contempt for the people who do the above knows no limits. They are NOT
  THE MAJORITY OF PLAYERS. If they were, I wouldn't still be guiding, taking
  shit from the twenty puerile belligerant fuckups every server seems to have. If you
  got banned for ANYTHING other than the above, I'm dying to hear from you. </p>
