<p>Time is valuable, especially for those of us who have to "work" and "sleep." The biggest pet peeve people have about EQ is the downtime spent traveling, medding, waiting for five other people to remove their thumbs from their asses and get to a wizard gate for a port, and then waiting some more for the one pudnucker who somehow missed the wizard on her KNEES begging for everyone to tell her if they needed a ride and announced halfway through the break in that he needed a port now please. But not "please," oh, no, that would be complicated and time consuming. Whenever someone wants to put you out and waste your time, they always indicate their urgency by typing "plz." Because those extra three letters would take forever to find using the mouthstick the speaker is using to type. Using hands would involve taking one out of his ass, and the other from around Mr. Happy. My question is, what is the PLZMaster eating? Does he wash his hands first?</p>
<p>So, yeah, we all hate downtime. That's a given. What confuses me are the anecdotes I get in my email about the people who complain about downtime at length in the game. Didn't they put in Gems as a pacifier for these people?</p>
<p>Only in EQ can you get a twink following you around for twenty minutes, begging for copper. Not plat, COPPER. The stuff that you can get with twenty minutes of rat killing. Only in EQ can you listen to someone spam the zone "Sow plz for CR at bank" for a solid hour, so he can travel five minutes away. I could see that on a PVP server, but on a blue server? Only in EQ do people bring entire raids to a screeching halt for hours so they can get a "56+ rezz only plz" when they have a 52 cleric sitting with them, ready to get back the smidgen of exp. Only in EQ can some completely annoying clueless pimple assed freak of nature glue huffing cock knocking goat fucking bitch watch FOUR BOATS go past the Freeport dock while he spams his "Need port to BB plz" hotkey.</p>
<p>Somebody park the goddam clue bus and get out the clue PANZERS, because this is obviously a tough logical problem for multitudes of the unwashed weenies who got hold of Mommy's credit card. See, what you do when you want something, is locate the people with the power to assist you IN THE ZONE. If you're in Freeport, the druid in Hate is probably going to put you low on the priority list. Anyway, find the appropriate person and ask them for help. If you can't find anyone because they are anonymous, screeching your desire to the zone isn't going to make them want to help you! You ARE why these people are anonymous! Quit spamming people who want to be able to read the boat announcement!</p>
<p>Especially when the entire server knows the spam whore in question has six accounts, one of which has the ubiquitous druid Twink Pimp Daddy, and a bank of computers that exceeds the Everquest server farm in number. Oh, yes, you know who you are. Stop asking people for stuff. You're fucking famous for rolling on everything ever to drop on behalf of your fourteen characters, all of which you play simultaneously and insist on dragging to plane raids. No one would mind if weren't for the fact that you suck at all of them. It's such fun knowing your warrior isn't attacking, your cleric isn't healing, your bard isn't playing, and your wizard isn't nuking because your ranger is having an argument with someone over some loot you want for your necro. After which you tell the puller to "stop plz, I need to rebuff." Congratulations! You're the only player on earth to fill up someone's ignore list all by yourself.</p>
<p>Don't you ever feel like a moron saving valuable time typing PLZ, when your sorry gimp ass can waste everyone else's night just by existing? I hope autofollow gets nerfed. I hope your overburdened credit card gets rejected. I hope your hand gets caught in your zipper. I hope you move somewhere and get stuck with a top speed of 28.8.</p>
<p>Mostly, I wish you'd just stop talking. Plz.</p>
