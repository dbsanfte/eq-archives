<p>So, I'm rereading the End User Licensing Agreement for personal reasons.
   For the reading impaired among you, that's the big honking block of text you
   see when you load the game, under which is a set of buttons indicating your
   acceptance or refusal of the terms described. You thoughtfully read the text,
   and click the button signifying your opinion. NOT! More like you grab that
   mouse, and click furiously, thinking come on come on, I gotta get my fix,
   come on come on come on, gimme the game here, I'm gonna die if I can't
   have my game.</p>
<p>I shall translate the document for you:</p>
<p>THIS AGREEMENT MEANS WE'RE LETTING YOU PLAY OUR GAME. If
   you keep clicking "decline," that could be the reason you don't get to play.
   Stop calling the tech line, you gimp.</p>
<p>1) Only grownups get to play. If you're a kid, your mom has to be watching. If
   your mom isn't watching it's her fucking fault and she can't sue us if you get
   cyberlaid.</p>
<p>2) You have to buy the game, and we don't buy the internet for you. We patch
   the game a lot. The really BIG patches are called expansions and you have
   to buy those. Also you have to pay for the action figures. When we make
   them.</p>
<p>3) We can change these rules whenever. You don't read them, so who
   cares?</p>
<p>4) Pick a password. Don't tell anybody, and don't make it easy. Hey, what's
   your password? AAARGH! We said you aren't supposed to tell anybody!</p>
<p>5) This game costs money to play. Like feeding quarters in at the arcade,
   but you don't notice how much you're spending because it's a credit card,
   and not really money.</p>
<p>6) We don't HAVE to let you play our game. If you hurt our feelings, we can
   make you go away. Well... technically you have to break one of the rules we
   put on our website, but since you don't read this big block of text everyone
   THINKS we can make you leave whenever and you gimps believe us. So
   STFU.</p>
<p>7) No fair making copies or hacking our code. We don't want you to know
   that this is basically a MUDD with pretty pictures.</p>
<p>8) It's our game. We sold it. Not you. So STFU.</p>
<p>9) ShowEQ is bad, mmmkay? Oh, and no selling stuff on Ebay. Because we
   made this stuff, and only we can make money from it. There's not like a law
   or anything, so we're going to sound real stern here.</p>
<p>10) The name of your pretend person can't be Luke Skywalker because
   then George Lucas would get mad and his lawyer can beat up our lawyer.</p>
<p>11) Don't put viruses in chat rooms we run. Also your pretend person can't
   be an asshole. Well, it can, but not anything that might make the FCC beat
   us up.</p>
<p>12) We might tell people who you really are and what your personal
   information is. Also, if you ask tech support for help, you might want to take
   ShowEQ off your machine, because we can do anything we want to your
   computer. Like check all the files. We're allowed. Oh, and Sony can tell you
   gimps what to do, too.</p>
<p>13) We sold you the game, but if it goes kablooie it's not our fault. Just
   cause you can't play due to lag or gremlins or our jizz in the server, it's not
   our fault.</p>
<p>14) If your year old character goes kablooie, it's not our fault and you're shit
   out of luck. Well, in some states we might have to give you a hundred bucks.</p>
<p>15) There's like, laws and stuff that back us up. So STFU.</p>
<p>16) If you're going to sue us, it has to be in California. Oh, and just cause we
   didn't bust your friend for ShowEQ althought we knew about it, we can still
   bust you.</p>
 <p>17) Send mail to this address. Well, don't do that. We just throw it out.
   Here's the long distance number you call to get the exact same recording as
   1 888 STATION. We can change how much we charge you whenever. You
   can call 1 800 952 5210 which is the consumer affairs place in California if
   you think you have a real problem. Oh, and here's how to get stuff to keep
   your kids from seeing the porno that is an elf in newbie gear. STFU.</p>
<p>This is Tweety, speaking. Look at #17. See that 800 number you can call if
   you think you have a real consumer complaint? IT DOESN'T WORK. You get
   the "you cannot dial this number from your calling area message 5802"
   voice.</p>
<p>The mind reels.</p>
