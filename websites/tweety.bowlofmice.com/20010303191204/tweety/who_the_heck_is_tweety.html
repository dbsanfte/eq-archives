 </p>
<p class="yellow">Warning! I do NOT have a character named Tweety. Anyone WITH a character named Tweety is full of shit if they claim to be me.</p>
<p>Your Questions Answered: Yes, I'm female. I'm in the 25-34 demographic. People are usually surprised when they meet me, because they expect me to be taller and fatter. I went to Greensboro College and Radford University. I don't show up on film, so there are no pictures of me in the world. Stop asking.</p>
<br>
<p><span class="red">Site Rules -</span> I don't publish your name, your server, or anything that might get you busted. YOU spare me the guessing games as to my "real" identity (which, by the way, is no more real than the "money" you have in the Norrathian banks).</p>
<p>I also will not answer, continue to read, or post ANY email containing racial slurs, religious slurs, the c-word (if you don't know what I mean, you're too young to read this website), derogatory remarks as to another's sexual orientation, or xenophobic comments. I believe that those who speak such things are not sufficiently evolved to be worthy of my attention. If you don't like it, kiss my white, straight, agnostic ass, pissant.</p>
