<p>Hi, Michelle - I met Lady Daegermo (spelling?) and gathered you and I were going to
  need to speak very soon. I had one request of her, and I'm not sure she was able to
  pass it on. I would like to speak with you on the phone, because it is my opinion that so
  much can be misinterpreted when one has a typed conversation?Having a meeting by
  phone can avoid all sorts of misunderstandings, and any wrongful impression that the
  other party is being rude.</p>
<p>Please contact me, via phone, tomorrow (Friday, September 1) after 2 PM Eastern
  time, which is 11 your time. My home number is xxx.xxx.xxxx. If I'm not there, it's
  because I am still caught at work. Flex time is all well and good until the boss asks you
  to finish up one little thing! I have no voice mail, so if you miss me, please reply to this
  email with a number I can reach you at.</p>
<p>I am looking forward to talking to you. I have high hopes that it will be a productive, civil
  meeting between two people who care about the game, albeit with different
  approaches.</p>
<p> Sincerely,</p><br><br>

<p>I appreciate your desire to discuss the matter on the phone, however our support of the
  game is handled either ingame or in email. It is not necessary to discuss the matter on
  the phone.</p>
<p>I have removed you from the guide program for clear violations of the policies you
  agreed to uphold when you joined the guide program. This matter is not open for
  discussion. I have submitted your play account for temporary suspension of seven days
  for also violating the policies is such a way that is it detrimental the respect of all
  guides. Disclosing information provided to you as a guide negatively effects the entire
  guide program and is not tolerated. During this seven day period we will review the
  matter of your account for a determination to be made of banning the account
  permanently.</p>
<p>Regardless of your intentions this violation of the confidence and trust given to guides
  was broken by you and the issue is now closed.</p>
<p>It is with regret that these actions will be taken, however the violations of the policies in
  which the program upholds is not tolerated.</p>
<p> Sincerely,</p>
<p> Michelle Butler<br>
