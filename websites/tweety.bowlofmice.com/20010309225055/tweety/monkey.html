<p>Last night, I was struggling to find something to laugh about, and the gods of EQ obliged by sending me something really, really funny. I was hanging out in IRC, trying to solve a hardware problem with my computer, and I met a regular reader. He sent me a link to the funniest board I ever read.</p>
<p>It was the message board for an EQ server, but not just any message board. This board had reservations for the planes, the big dragons, and all the high level raids available. Except for Plane of Growth, and the thread explaining why not was hilarious - the primary reasons for it appear to be because "the Plane of Growth is big, and people can share, unlike Hate," and the perhaps more accurate reason "an officer from one of the uber guilds doesn't like the guy who suggested scheduling POG raids." Okay, reason one is worthless, mmkay? My last experience with inter-guild politics was in AUGUST, and it was commonly accepted on my server that two different raids could coexist in Hate. The rumored changes coming to Hate and Fear may change that, but for now, two guilds can easily handle a little sharing. The second reason strikes me as the most likely. EQ is a society, and sometimes, we just don't like each other. And sometimes, we get a little too puffed up about our video game status and treat people like shit.</p>
<p>Anyway. Not only do people respect this message board (and like all message boards, I doubt that half the server even knows the link to it), but they post their raid dates….some as far away as JUNE. Yeah, no need to check your calendars, kiddies, it's only February. Guys, plane raids are like getting laid - some planning is good, but planning four months in advance means you have no fucking life. Literally.</p>
<p>And of course, the SOOPER L33T guilds were talking smack to the little guilds, and little guilds were keeping quiet because to speak up would mean not being invited to tag along for scraps. There's even a few comments about the menace that one particular little guild represents by not paying attention to the SCHEDULE. Of course, the big guilds don't pay attention to the schedule either - I gathered from inference that the big boys have leveled up twinks to 52 so they can keep on smushing Naggy and Vox every time one lets out a breath. I remember when EMarr was like that. It didn't last long. Something about not giving a flying fuck if the super l33t guilds respected the little people or not, and you know, my server got over it. After level 55 or so, everyone knows everyone else, and they realize that 130 days /played is not really something to take pride in. You play that long, and you realize that people play the game for different reasons, and your penis won't grow one millimeter longer if you kill four dragons in one night. Well, maybe a millimeter. What's everyone so paranoid about, anyway? Very few people use their friend list to keep track of people they're pissed at, because they'd rather keep track of their… friends.</p>
<p>I find phenomena like this message board schedule to be interesting. Schedules and leaders have exactly as much power as the unwashed masses allow them to have. Most server communities try scheduling raids at some point in their development when they realize there are several groups of people capable of Getting Shiny Toys. It rarely works for long, because the calendar is inherently unfair. If the server crashes the night of your raid, too bad for you if you didn't sign up for another night. If you can't go because your cleric is having a baby and her enchanter husband kinda wants to be there, too bad for you if you can't find a replacement. If your little guild suddenly adds or grows new high level players who want to raid, tough cookies, because the guild with four hundred people CALLED IT FIRST. Servers grow and mature, and a bottleneck forms right at the gate to planes and dragons. Suddenly, irrelevant details like "who deserves it" and "you can't because I said so" start getting tossed around like feces in a monkey cage.</p>
<p>And eventually, the monkeys do what monkeys always do - they start indiscriminately screwing the other monkeys. Then the bottom monkey gets sick of it, and bites the big monkey. And ten minutes later, the big monkey has forgotten all about it, and has moved on to bigger and better bananas. Do you blame the guy who built the cage for a smaller number of monkeys? Do you blame the monkeys? Or do you smile, laugh, and move on to the panda exhibit?</p>
