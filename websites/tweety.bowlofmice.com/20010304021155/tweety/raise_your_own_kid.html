<p>My basement is a mass of computer game boxes, and one thing all the boxes have in common is a little square, with a letter. There's a few letter T's, but by and large the letter is M - for mature. Putting aside the maturity debate (since it could be argued that no one in my house is mature, exactly), there are certain facts. Every member of this household is well past the age of 18 (when I say well past, I mean one of the members is twice that age). We like our games to have a little edge, a little bite. We like porn. We like stuff blowing up. We like drinking and smoking and cussing. There are no Barney fans here.</p>
<p>My point? I'm a grownup, and if I want some morally questionable entertainment, I goddam well am going to have it.</p>
<p>I love kids. When my friends bring their kids around, I'm down on the ground wrestling, playing tag, instructing in the fine arts of tree climbing, and in general acting like the big child I am. This is not an "I hate kids" diatribe.</p>
<p>What the fuck is up with these laws that are getting submitted in flocks to slap restrictions on entertainment? Why do people get on message boards and cry about games that are violent or flash some pixellated tit or have players that occasionally shout out "Clusterfuck to zone - drop yer jocks and grab yer socks and run for it"?  Often, the answer makes me want to throw up - Protect the Children.</p>
<p>More specifically, the person speaking is usually really saying "protect MY child." Mostly, I like Hillary Clinton, but I swear someday I'm going to stuff a sweatsock up her ass for the "it takes a village" crap. Sure, it's an accurate statement, but the rabid parent activists (meaning parents who prefer activism to parenting) have construed this exhausted cliché to mean that we all have a responsibility to the children of the community. Guess what, you self-centered morons, my responsibility begins and ends with me not blowing my cigarette smoke in your rugrat's face. I pat myself on the back for not smoking around your precious dumpling, and my work here is done.</p>
<p>Why is cussing a warnable offense in Everquest? Sure, as a guide I busted the chops of some dork standing in East Commons shouting FUCK YOU, FUCK THE GUIDES, FUCK ELVES, BUT MOSTLY FUCK YOU for an hour, but not for the cussing. He was annoying, and spamming the zone with his newfound discovery of the work fuck. The word wasn't the problem, though, HE was. There's a cute little filter that turns the word "fuck" into something cute like "frizzle frog" or something. I categorically refused to warn someone for saying any of the Seven Words (go read about George Carlin if you don't get that reference). The box says M for Mature, is there a reason we can't cuss?</p>
<p>Why is sexual fan fiction bad? I was and am a big fan of Faydwer's Frolickers, two women who run a sensually oriented website using their EQ characters as a jumping off point for their wonderful fiction. Sorry, I'd make a link, but they removed themselves from the public in the aftermath of the Mystere debacle, fearing that they would be next on the target list. All the naked elves running around Norrath is all right, but talking about their nudity isn't okay. The box says M for Mature, is there anyone playing who hasn't at least thought about getting laid?</p>
<p>I don't understand the concept of a big kid not being able to buy a game at Walmart. You know, call me a weirdo, but if a kid is old enough to have a job, and use some of the money he earned to drive himself to the software outlet, why is he too young and tender to play the game of his choice? Two of my best friends in the Everquest world were not even old enough to drive when I met them. I was not aware of their ages until they told me, and while it melted my brain at first, in the end, it didn't matter a rat's ass. It didn't change their insightful comments, their playing skills, their generosity, their sense of humor. What it explained was why they always had to go by ten PM on a weeknight.</p>
<p>Sure, I've met some preteens, throwing temper tantrums because shit didn't go their way. Unlike their family bosoms where everything they do is perfect, however, their uncontrolled behavior had consequences in EQ - they were put on /ignore, they were made fun of, they were left out of raids, they were booted from guilds. Some of those folks have learned from this, and learned to control themselves in game. Some have not.</p>
<p>What I don't appreciate is the little misguided sperms' PARENTS taking over the keyboard and lecturing me on my language in a /tell to the little fuckface. Excuse me? What made you think the internet was safe for your bastard? I'm supposed to behave as I would in a school playground? This IS my playground, moron, my ass doesn't fit in the little swings at the real one anymore.</p>
<p>At least those parents are in the same room with their busted rubbers when the computer is on. Half credit for that one, at least. Moving past "I don't appreciate" into "I fucking HATE" is the letter I got from one darling mommy. This wonderful woman was checking the bookmarks on her fourteen year old son's computer. (Hint - if the machine is in the child's ROOM, you aren't really monitoring what he does! Spying on him while he's at school doesn't get you any Parent Points!) Guess what site she found…. That's right, your favorite Bird With Attitude. She begged me to consider that my site was for fans of a cartoon game, and that it was very likely that my fans were young people who need a good example. A cartoon? Young people? MY readers?</p>
<p>Jesus Humperdink Christ, idiot, the average age of an EverQrackhead is pushing thirty. Most of my mail comes from people at work developing websites and engineering networks, followed closely in mass by people who manage customer service desks. If I changed my site to remove the cusswords, I wouldn't be able to call you a fucking dumbass in need of sterilization. Did you get a free lobotomy with the episiotomy?</p>
<p>Like the glutton for punishment that I am, I wrote her back, and explained that my site was clearly labeled as intended for adults, and that I personally expected parents to monitor their child's internet excursions. Furthermore, I told her I bore no responsibility for what her child might encounter on the net. She replied, and told me she was going to contact my server host and get my offensive material either removed or password protected, since the content was adult in nature.</p>
<p>If you ever come to this site, and get a box requesting the password to view my material, the username will be CENSORS_CAN and the password will be EATME. Raise your own kid, bitch.</p>
