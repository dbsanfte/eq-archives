<p>I love nice people. Nice people are socially acceptable. They conform to cultural standards. They channel their anger into productive channels. They don't offend, they don't jaywalk, and they only read nice things. They have absorbed prevailing socializations so well they can't perceive any alternative behavior as anything but abnormal and wrong. Without nice people, there would be no society, for they are the Normal Ones by which all other behavior is judged.</p>
<p>Nice people know that sex is something you only do in the dark, with someone of the opposite gender, with the male on top. Without nice people in the world, we would have no idea that a private discussion between adults on the internet is bad and yucky. We wouldn't have any idea that we should feel dirty and guilty when we look at pixellated elves, without nice people.</p>
<p>Nice people know that curse words are bad, because they express emotions that aren't, well, nice. Nice people do not cuss, or call people names. Nice people just don't react that way. Instead, when something angers them, they try to drive it away, shove it under a rock, pretend it isn't there, and they assert that anyone who disagrees with them must be a bad person.</p>
<p>Nice people are adept at detecting when something is a Waste of Time, and they possess a special moral compass that can determine the value of video games versus, say, golf or fishing or watching television.</p>
<p>You know that saying, "don't judge a book by its cover"? Nice people are exempt from this truism. They alone can see someone with tattoos, funny colored hair, piercings, or weight problems, and see the evil that lurks within.</p>
<p>Yes, nice people serve a valuable purpose in this world, keeping back the forces of darkness for those of us too stupid to know the work of the devil when it stares us in the face. So, it is with sorrow that I report a definite decline in the population of nice people. It always seems to happen when regular people begin to think for themselves. All over the internet, people are downloading porn, expressing their opinions, refusing to apologize for their appearance, listening to devil music, and playing video games instead of exposing their tender minds to the violence and self-serving bullshit that is television. More specifically, the violence on CNN. And women are occasionally getting on top when the situation calls for it.</p>
<p>OH THE HORROR. It's the end of civilization as we know it.</p>
