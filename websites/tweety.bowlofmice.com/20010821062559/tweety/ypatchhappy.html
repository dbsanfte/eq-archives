<p>Boy, yet another doozy of a patch. Bugs getting fixed, details being added, and new bits of content flowing forth like unto a dog's bowels after eating three bars of soap. Please don't ask how I know that. I never want to think about how I know that ever again as long as I live. I ask you, SOAP? I realize animals can eat rotten meat with joy in their hearts, but you'd think soap might be over the line.</p>
<p>The last few patches have not been vast sweeping changes of doom, but more the little things in life. Messages to tell you what you've picked up, and what you're on the verge of destroying. Little tags to tell you what size an item is, and how big the opening of your bag is. Teeny numbers on your skill bar to let you know how far over 100 you've gotten in your old age. A warning from the merchant before you sell that backpack full of blue diamonds and quest armor. A blue line in your exp bar to tell you how close you are to level without having to know how to run a Linux box. The ability to rearrange a bulging bank vault without swapping bags out of your bulging inventory. BEING ABLE TO BUY STACKS OF ORE, OR ANY OTHER DAMN THING THAT STACKS. When I was training up blacksmithing, I had this recurring fantasy of chaining the person who designed the tradeskills to a desk and forcing him/her/it to drink three gallons of water one drop at a time. And piss it out the same way.</p>
<p>In short, Verant is fixing the things that didn't affect (or should that be effect, snicker) your gameplay, until you finally went insane and compulsively posted "VERANT SUX" on every game related EZBoard you could find. Playing Everquest had previously been like driving a jalopy you bought for four hundred dollars. It had oodles of personality and quirks, and you loved it very much, until you got a shot at test driving a model that didn't require a Dukes of Hazzard entry and a coat hanger wedged into the gear shift. It's as if Verant has stopped using duct tape, and is reupholstering the seats in kid glove leather AND throwing in walnut veneer.</p>
<p>So basically, EQ is almost finished with its beta period. Who's coding this bounteous goodness? The excuse we guide types heard over the summer of 2000 was that everyone was hard at work on Kunark, and no one could be spared to fix such trifles as falling for a zillion points through a solid hill, let alone smoothing out the rough spots. With Shadows of Luclin being announced for a holiday release, I would think the fabulous coding monkeys would be otherwise occupied. With things such as making gnomes look like armor wearing Down's Syndrome kids at scout camp, for instance.</p>
<p>Most of this cornucopia of non-suck is obviously in response to the competition coming up over the hills. Six months ago, I was sitting in the producer's office at Mythic Entertainment and staring in slack jawed wonder at a game, hearing about the wonders of server side filtering - and how it wasn't hard and required no new technology. Everquest discovered server filtering just as <a href="http://www.darkageofcamelot.com">Dark Age of Camelot</a> went into open beta, and that's just the first example that springs to mind. Future plans for the Qrack are rumored to include improved PVP and skill trees for the highest level players to specialize their characters.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong - I applaud all of the user-friendly changes, and I salute whoever it was at Verant that made it happen. Anything that makes EQ less like work and more like fun is good. It's only in my more cynical moments that I think the changes are about half in response to competition and the other half a Disneyfication for the kids buying the bargain bin ten dollar edition. But gosh, if we're going to see the results of cherry picking the upcoming games, I wonder what's next - housing? Animals you can ride? All classes capable of soloing to some degree? Or dare I say it… <a href="http://www.glitchless.com">FETAPULTS</a>?</p>
