<p>Well...a new season of Survivor has begun. 
<p>In this aside I will give it all the attention it deserves.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<p>There.  I feel better now that this is out of the way. 
<p>*** 
<p>According to America Online health news today, "the world is rapidly growing fat and out of shape," experts say. 
<p>In what could be the funniest commentary on the human condition I've seen since we all read about the blue dress that never made it to the dry cleaners, experts are saying that the number of overfed people has come to equal the number of underfed people and that soon the time will come when the majority of the earth's population will be too fat. 
<p>The article does not mention what standard is being used to define the phrase "too fat," nor does it specify what task these people are too fat to achieve...it merely poses the possibility of too many fat people on the planet in generalized terms. 
<p>Word is not yet in as to whether the mere fact that someone wasted time and 
energy on such a moronic point is sad, or just funny. 
<p>(We at Brief Asides™ feel that wasting the space on writing about someone 
else's waste of space is BOTH sad AND funny.) 
<p>***
<p>To answer the spiritual debate currently raging on the boards about the 
existence of God: 
<p>I hadn't heard from my wife since last June (the divorce will be going through 
this March), when I received a letter from her the other day. 
<p>She has, apparently, found God (among other things).
<p>This pretty much settles it. If anyone is looking for God, my wife has him.  I'm sorry I can't give a specific address, since I don't exactly know where my wife is, but she's got him. If you do find God, please send me the address, I have some mail I need to forward to her. 
<p>***
<p>For those of you who didn't watch the Superbowl: 
<p>The best commercial was Budweiser dog gets sucked up by a flying saucer and 
taken to the alien homeworld. When it gets there, it sheds its dog suit to reveal an alien.  They ask what it's learned, and it replies "Whazzzzaaaap," to which they all respond "WHAAAZAAAAP."
<p>Mindless, good special effects, humor, aliens, beer. What can I say?  It had it all. 
<p>*** 
<p>Sitting here in Tweety's basement, (no I wasn't present for the recent Online geek gathering.  In true online geek spirit, I spent the week at my parent's house) trying to form my new survival plans.
<p>No, I'm not talking strategy for remaining a part of the nations number one overrated dull-ass show…I'm talking about how to counter the growing surge of revolutionary terrorist technology: the breaded chicken finger assassins.
<p>Currently we are sending advisors to the Potomac Institute for Policy studies in Washington to fully decipher the depth of this new national threat, and how best to counter it.  For myself, I plan on doing my own part as an American citizen by trying to form counter-chicken technology of my own in case my country needs it.  I've implored Tweety to do the same…hopefully she is, even now, embarking on her own measures to counter act the oncoming hordes of frozen goodie wielders that must already be at the doorstep.
<p>I hope you will do your part.  None of us are safe as long as drug dealers and ebayers are free to buy chicken fingers at will on our streets...and even our children's playgrounds.  
<p>Remember: Chicken fingers are NOT needed for hunting, nor are they a reasonable measure for household defense.  Chicken fingers are NOT your friend.
<p>Thank you, and good night.
