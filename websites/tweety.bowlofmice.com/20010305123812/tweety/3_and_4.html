<p>Dear Michelle,</p>

<p>The reason I wanted to speak with you in person was not for the purposes of discussing why my guide account is being deactivated. That was patently obvious. What I wanted to discuss was some questions I had about the program in general, and I wanted to share with you some of the enormous amount of feedback I've received from currently active GMs, guides, and seniors. Out of hundreds of posts and emails my temper tantrum has elicited, only three have been negative. If you think there's a silent majority out there who thinks I was wrong, you are missing the point. These are not the posters from Whineplay, as it is popularly known. These are literate, thoughtful human beings with whom I struck a chord</p>
<p>I also wanted to hear from you in terms of other things I have stated, in terms of answering real guide questions that deserve a better answer than "because we said so." The vast majority of your guides are not eighteen year olds. They are adults, with jobs and families. My former server, XXX, is understaffed. Many dedicated, caring people have quit the program for reasons far more complicated than simple burnout.</p>
<p>Finally, I was looking for some feedback as to my performance as a guide. I believe that as a guide, I served well. I treated each and every player as a living breathing human being having a bad day or some sort of problem. As a caring listener, I solved far more problems on a one to one basis than I ever created. However, I wanted more feedback than simply my opinion.</p>
<p>You might be interested in hearing this - approximately 15% of my emails thus far have been asking how to become a guide. I have done nothing but praise the program, explained that the good outweighs the bad, and talked about how each guide team is like a guild, but better. My criticisms were all involving either the vagaries of a certain class of player, or in the poor communication between Verant and their customer service program. There are many players who would cut the guides some slack if they only knew the rules under which we operate, the limitations we have, and the conditions under which we work.</p>
<p>These were the things I wanted to talk about. While I have no idea if you've even checked the website, I can tell you that I have posted nothing about this. I wanted to wait until I had some feedback from you. If you do not wish to have any sort of dialogue, I would like to know why. One thing that I picked up from various postings dealing with other account bannings, etc: there is always another side to the story. What I am asking for is yours.</p>
<p> Sincerely,</p><br><br>
<p>Email #4</p>

<p>You have violated the utmost confidence given to you as a member of the guide program. If other members of the guide program have discussed concerns with you then you should explain to them to follow the policies and escalations of the program.</p>
<p>You appear to be interested in your performance as a guide. I will say again that you violated the trust the program had in you as a guide and as an individual.</p>
<p> Sincerely,</p>
