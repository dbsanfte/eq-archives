<p>I'm trotting out an old memory for you die hard EQ fans to mull over, and to consider before you hit your next cheater site. Something seems missing from a game that is obsessed over, analyzed, and parsed. I believe that the missing element is the fun.</p>
<p>I was not quite through with level 35, universally loathed as the first and worst hell level. No hell level after 35 is quite as bad. Think of it like getting a root canal. That first attack of the killer high pitched drill hurts like a sonofabitch, because you weren't expecting the level of agony. The second time isn't so bad - you know it's going to hurt, you know you don't like it, but you know about how long the pain will last and that it will eventually end. That first time though, as far as you can tell it has lasted forever and will never end. The fact that a major game component can be plausibly likened to a root canal says something unpleasant about the coders of the game, but that's a whole 'nother topic.</p>
<p>At any rate, I had been running on the hamster wheel of leveling with a friend. He had been awfully quiet for about forty kills, and then he said something about needing to improve his bard faction. "Okay, okay, just one more lizard and I'll level, I'm sure of it," I muttered as I continued to race around. It struck me that all I had said to my best friend in two hours was "thorns dropping" and "need regen" and "mana check." That's just wrong. In college we used to wander train tracks, explore old buildings, and generally have fun. This had to stop because we live in different states? We have this virtual world! </p>
<p>So we went to Castle Mistmoore. For the hell of it. I can hear many people in the viewing audience gasping in horror. "That's lousy exp at 35! What were you thinking?" I thought the same thing upon zone in and discovered the Horde of Green Death all those little caster dark elves represented. "Mutter, I could have leveled by now," thought I.</p>
<p>Three invis spells and twelve incidents of "fuck it, let's just kill the vermin" later, we got to an iron fence. There was blue stuff in there! I became interested in spite of myself. We fought our way in, carefully. I stopped to admire the little details like the gravestone inscriptions, the nifty marks on the small building, the little wall around the house. Behind the house was an invisible man! All you could see was his book with puzzling glyphs in it! We killed him, and we were disappointed by the loot. A caster robe, that we agreed would make a great newbie freebie. No nifty book, though. I wandered into the little building, and saw the ubiquitous Brown Bag of Dropped Loot on a coffin. I reported to my friend in great excitement that I was in some sort of crypt. I picked up the loot, and literally squealed, it was so neat. Then I tried to open the coffin. Hrm, nothing happens, maybe I should click on the other side. As I walked around, I fell through the floor! I landed in a stone room, and when I looked up, I saw that the crypt was far, far above me.</p>
<p>Ever loyal, my friend followed me down. I handed him the loot I had pulled from the coffin, and he laughed out loud at the cute little daisy. We cast invis on ourselves for safety, and crept out of the room in true Dungeons and Dragons style. After climbing dark, twisty stairs, we came to a room filled with doors. As I stood in the corner, uneasily standing guard against unexpected guests, my friend tried each door. None of them opened. The last door was even more annoying - the damn thing opened onto a brick wall. My friend sighed, and turned back to me. My eyes bugged out as I looked over his shoulder. As the brick wall door closed, all the other doors swung open! Each room had multiple monsters lurking within! We shivered, grateful for our invisibility.</p>
<p>We crept further into the castle. Each new turn found gargoyles, servants, and new monsters. We were hopelessly lost, and the adrenaline boost was amazing. The evening did not end terribly well, with a sad tale of lag spikes, the monk going link dead leaving the druid alone to die horribly. At the end of the night, we parted ways, agreeing to meet there the next day, this time with maps in hand.</p>
<p>I logged off and went straight for a map site, to get the dirt on Mistmoore. Two clicks, and I was looking at a wonderful rendering of the entire zone. I traced the route we had taken, and saw exactly where we had been. And I felt rotten.</p>
<p>I had fast forwarded the movie and found out that the princess was saved. I had skipped to the end of the novel and found out who the murderer was. I was going to meet my friend to explore the castle again, but instead of fear and wonder with one hand on the evac button, it was going to be calm, methodical, and… dull. I had gotten off the hamster wheel, into a wild forest. And the first thing I did after this new discovery was scurry back onto the hamster wheel.</p>
<p>Verant is doing their absolute damndest to ruin their magnificent creation with ham handed bullshit, nerfing, and nonsensical pronouncements from befuddled and ignorant spokesmen. Yet, they produced a world so vast that even a player with a year of playing hasn't seen it all. Someone on the web has seen it, though, so a new place is hardly explored before we race to the map sites and the quest spoilers. Why do we take the only good things about Everquest and ruin them all by ourselves? I wish I'd never seen a map of Castle Mistmoore.</p>
