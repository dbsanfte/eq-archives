<p>Due to my thinking that no one would care about the inaccurately named "Weekly Updates" until I got email to the contrary, stuff older than 10/17 is lost forever. Since we're talking about a month and a half's worth of
   stuff, this is no great loss.</p>
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE 5/25/01</p>   
<p>To PVP or not to PVP? Older guilds across the servers are contemplating moving to the new server that Verant is designing. No rules, exp loss when killed by a player plus or minus five levels to you, no rules, coinloot only, no rules. Bind point camping, newb harvesting, training, kill stealing, it's all good if you've got the power to back up your trash talking. As one of my guildmates said, Verant is building a sandbox and equipping the kiddies with glass shards and rubbing alcohol.</p>
<p>Sounds kinda cool, though, right? Someone whines at you? WHAP. Someone tries to steal your kill? Send that bitch back to his bind point. Someone annoys you? Buh bye! Beggars? What are those?</p>
<p>The thing about all these warm and fuzzy fantasies is that the person doing the dreaming is always picturing himself as the one doing the bitchslapping. Never mind that the odds are the dreamer is much more likely to get slapped. They're called "odds," and the odds of any one person being the resident piranha in the pond of koi are not good. I predict an enormous opening day population - dropping to around a thousand in a week. With 800 of them being iksar.</p>
<p>This weekend's rant has absolutely NOTHING to do with gaming. You have been warned. Have a good weekend, gang.</p>   
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE 5/21/01</p>   
<p>Plenty of bitching on my old play server about the 10th Coldain Ring step - it was attempted and failed, and so Thurgadin was destroyed. Everyone was delighted by the gored guards and punctured merchants… until the city didn't reset in two hours as advertised. It stayed that way for two days, something about a bug. I gotta say, while I imagine it would annoy the crap out of me if I were on dorf faction and had nowhere else to shop in Velious, it should be said that for the longest time the biggest complaint about EQ is that players couldn't affect the world. Well, now they can. Shrug. I guess everyone meant "affect the world as long as I'm not inconvenienced." Of course, Verant should have been fair and made quests that could level Skyshrine and Kael, so we could have faction wars and make everyone inconvenienced. Now, that would rock. People would get much more serious about defending their chosen city. Oh wait, that would be Dark Age of Camelot or Shadowbane...</p>
<p>I sure wish I'd been able to afford a jaunt to E3; regretfully, I was never paid for some freelance writing I did that would have financed the trip. Instead, I'm living vicariously through the friends who did get to go. So far the funniest quote is from a friend at Mythic, who was talking about how sad the use of naked-women-as-marketing was. He followed up that observation with "but our booth babes were very tasteful." Fortunately, I don't have to disown him, he caught the irony right away.</p>
<p>No rant today for you, I've been spring cleaning that dog ass smell out of my house. How my dog managed to shed on the windowsills, I would pay money to find out. Cat hair I'd expect, but beagle hair six feet off the ground on a basement window ledge just seems improbable.</p>   
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE 5/16/01</p>   
<p>Don't ever, ever call me on Tuesday nights. I am not responsible for my actions from nine to ten PM. Michael Weatherly would want me if only he knew I was alive, I swear. Yeah, yeah, my Dark Angel fixation is only getting worse. Next Tuesday is the last new episode until next fall, and I'm already feeling agony. I haven't been this hooked since X-Files. Go ahead, mock me, but Don Johnson never looked so good in a five o'clock shadow, and he was never secure enough in his manhood to handle an ass kicking female partner. And you know, at the rate Jessica Alba is improving, she's going to be a damn good actress by the third season.</p>
<p>My temp job is drawing to a close. Like a frog who was originally placed in tepid water, I'm sitting in a full rolling boil and happy in it. I know my coworkers now! I have a routine! I have a spot at lunch! I surf the web while I pull staples! I would rather hang myself with barbed wire than do this another week like they offered! Sweet baby jesus, when is the job market going to open back up...</p>
<p>Still looking for input on the VP key quest, the mail I've gotten so far has been pretty colorful. Have a anti-beggar rant, and have a good hump day, and no, that doesn't have anything to do with humping, so stop looking confused.</p>   
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE 5/14/01</p>   
<p>Excuse me while I hack up a lung. I caught some version of the spring plague at the end of last week, and it was ugly enough that I didn't feel like smoking. Worse, I didn't even feel like sitting at the computer. What I apparently did feel like doing was lying on the couch wrapped up in a vaguely dog ass smelling afghan with a jumbo sized roll of toilet paper watching fourteen hours of Animal Planet. Man, I love Emergency Vets. What a great show. Someday I'll have to watch it when I'm not running a fever of 102. That's Fahrenheit, for the non-USA readers.</p>
<p>While I was getting all teary eyed over dogs being treated for eating entire bottles of Motrin, my roommate was two fisting Everquest. This means he was playing two accounts at the same time, for you filthy minded people out there. There was some sort of router problem that dumped 99% of the players, causing Skinner Box residents across the planet to frantically spam the chat server. One account loaded into Erolissi Marr after a hundred and ten tries. When he attempted to load in the other one, he got a message "there is no response from that world server." He looked from one computer, happily sitting IN that world server, to the void message, and came upstairs. He had to get a sponge to wipe up the mess from his head exploding.</p>
<p>Today's rant is about the joys of being on a "mature server." This does not mean the players are more mature, it means the server is old enough to have a massive bottleneck at all the high level stuff. What's a bored level 60 to do? Roll a twink, of course!</p>   
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE 5/10/01</p>
<p>Did you miss me? Many of you are absolutely fabulous, and I very much appreciate the kind offers of web space and hosting. The problem with the domain was that the owner recently moved, and his life has been a trifle chaotic lately. He's settled in now, so hopefully I am too.</p>
<p>You know the Simpson's episode where Homer joins the Stonecutters? Okay, remember the song in that episode called "We Do"? Now you remember the line in the song that goes "Who makes Steve Guttenberg a star?" I blame the Stonecutters for Brendan Fraser. The Mummy Returns is just such a waste of time, and this is coming from a female who really enjoys old Hong Kong chop chop movies. I don't generally fork over ten bucks to think. I want ass kicking, stuff blowing up, and Jackie Chan. A movie does not have to be deeply meaningful for me to love it. Sorry, but ol' Brendan is too affable, too normal, too guy-next-door to pull off the role of the action hero. The guy is the Steve Guttenberg of this age.</p>
<p>I'm working on a piece about the Veeshan's Peak key quest, thanks to a suggestion from Gloriana Frostglitter on the Emarr server. Feel free to send me your anecdotes, as the only first hand experience I have with this campathon is listening to my roommate scream at the monitor. Today's incoherent rambling is on the patch messages.</p>   
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE 5/4/01</p>   
<p>Son of a bitch. This week just went by too fast. Because I am still an unworthy temp, I still sit at a desk with no phone at a computer with no word processing capability. Although I still do no actual work of value (today was day three in the Great Staple Pulling Extravaganza), I cannot write my rants in an easily portable document. Instead, inspiration strikes and I scribble my oral diarrhea onto the large size of post it note. I have a great big wad of post it notes… and no finished rant.</p>
<p>Why aren't I writing the damn thing right now? Little things like brushing a Rottweiler who is shedding in gigantic fluffy clumps all over the carpet… for those of you who have dogs, you understand. For the rest of you: Dogs originally bred for cooler climates have a wiry oily top coat, and a soft fluffy undercoat they grow out in winter. This dual coat system keeps them dry and warm in cold weather. Why this spoiled rotten brat of a Rottie needs a fucking undercoat, I have no idea. She sleeps on a toasty warm waterbed all night, she lounges on a couch most of the day, and she looks at me like I'm the Joan Crawford of canines when I ask her majesty to go outside to pee. But nevertheless, this ten year old, ninety pound lapdog who won't even nibble her kibble without it being mixed with hot water first grows in a undercoat, and sheds it every spring. Brushing her does not keep the hair to a minimum, it merely prevents hairballs large enough to develop sentience. My beagle has no undercoat, but tries her heart out to shed her tricolored wiry hairs everywhere as well.</p>
<p>So, anyway, I'm gonna brush this pooch, and bail out. Here's another OITG quote for you, keep on sending them in, guys.</p>    
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE 5/1/01</p>    
<p>Why yes, I realize it's May. What you don't realize is that I have all this effort I have to go through at the end of a month with archiving old rants and updates. Since I would like to hit the sack before dawn, I'm going to pretend it's still April.</p>
<p>Yet another female friend of Tweety is getting married, so the gathering of the hens was Saturday night. This bachelorette party involved many alcoholic beverages, a limo, a driver named Vinnie, and the usual squealing that results from a roomful of women. One of the women was groaning about her husband. It seems that their happy home had only one phone line, and an EQ addiction had taken it over until he saw the light and quit. All the girls were clucking sympathetically as I shrunk lower and lower in my seat. "Uh, I have a website on the game and stuff." To you all I am Tweety, ranter of games and addicted MMOG freakoid. To my chick friends, I am Bird, the girl who could be counted on to flip the fraternity house's power breaker when I deemed it time for people to get off the computer. The dichotomy is odd, but nothing a half dozen margaritas couldn't cure.</p>
<p>Enough babbling. Have a new, extremely funny Brief Aside, and I'll catch you later this week.</p>
