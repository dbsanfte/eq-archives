<p>Greetings and salutations, new EQ players. You've come in pretty fucking late to this game. It's been going since the spring of 1999, and the "M for Mature" ceased to have any meaning about a year ago. So many of you are standing at the clue train station that you're shoving each other onto the tracks, and even more of you are clutching the third rail. Here's a handy pocket guide, suitable for framing:</p>
<p>How To Get:</p>
<p>Spirit of the Wolf: First, identify the classes that can cast this spell. Shamans can do it after level 9, druids get it at 14, and rangers after 39 are capable of it as well. Asking a monk or a wizard might work, though, so definitely spam those classes repeatedly. Locate a person who can cast the spell. Walk up to them. If they are in a fight, or in a group, their mana is labeled NOT FOR YOU, so stand there and whine for at least ten minutes. If they seem to be doing nothing, be sure to type SOW PLZ forty times, because they might be talking to someone and you'll want to make sure they heard you. If they say nothing, they are AFK, so continue to stand there, perhaps hitting the D key over and over so it looks like you're humping them. If they say no, they are just playing hard to get. They probably want to cyber with you, so suggest that as payment for the sow. If they say yes, do not offer to pay them. Everyone knows how cheap spells are, and mana is even easier to get - just sit there! You actually have places to go, and they just sit around regaining mana. The nerve of these damn casters.</p>
<p>Clarity: Being the only class that can cast this spell, all enchanters are created for the sole purpose of casting clarity on other players. Because they are so modest, many enchanters make themselves anonymous. The first step to clarity, then, is to repeatedly send tells to everyone who is anonymous, because they are often enchanters. Shouting "need CRACK" also works sometimes, and it's phrase that will mark you as an "insider," because that's what all the cool people secretly call clarity.</p>
<p>Buffs: Did you know that monks can cast buffs? They try to pretend they can't, but that's because all the people who play monks are assholes. Everyone knows that a character who waves their arms around is casting a spell, so don't you believe that "instill doubt animation" crap for a second. Follow them around the entire Lake of Ill Omen zone and pester them until they buff you.</p>
<p>Rez: Rez is short for a word that is really hard to spell, so don't even worry about it. When you ask, make sure that you specify 49+ rez in your shout. See, some clerics can only cast "revive," which only saves you the walk back to your corpse. It doesn't get back the experience at all! You don't want that pussy spell, so if someone offers to revive you, reply to their tell with something like "fuckoff dude I want the real thing." Clerics have super short memories, and they will forget you ever said that when they get the real rez spell. It helps if the cleric you ask for a rez is at least five zones away from where you died. That way you know they won't try to steal your camp spot. Do NOT offer to pay a cleric for a rez, because, like enchanters, this is the only class that can rez people and it is the only reason they exist. Also like enchies, clerics tend to be anonymous, so you should spam everyone with that tag.</p>
<p>Money: "Leave the city. Locate a monster. Kill it. Loot it. Sell the loot. Repeat." What a bunch of bullshit! Those high level characters are just ROLLING in cash. They pretend that their gear costs thousands of plat, but there's a secret door off of the tunnel in East Commons that they all go into to get their fancy outfits. They have plenty of dough, and you're entitled to it. Ask them for the location of the secret room while you're at it.</p>
<p>Armor and Weaponry: Those guys wearing plane armor and carrying the Uber Stick of Fudge Packing didn't start life wearing it, so you know those greedy bastards have some stuff just gathering dust in their vaults. Try walking up to one of those people completely naked (put your stuff in the bank first). Most high level players are really stupid, so they fall for the "poor naked elf" thing every time. They won't give you the really good stuff, though, so as soon as they give you something be sure to /auction it for sale. Give them fifteen seconds to leave the zone so they won't know you didn't really want their present.</p>
<p>If you have any trouble understanding the above, just think of it this way. Those creeps at Verant say this is a multiplayer game, but look around your computer room - except for your oddly stained poster of the Nitro Girls, is there anybody else in the room but you? See! You are the only person in the game, so go out and claim your rights!</p>
