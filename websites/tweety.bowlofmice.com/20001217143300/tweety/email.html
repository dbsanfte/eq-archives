<p>Questions archived here: Stupid names, bug list, confusing /con messages, male masturbation, unfair banning, your ID number, official bug list.</p>
<p class="yellow">QUESTION: Why did I get suspended for submitting stupid names to the server? I was just seeing what would get through.</p>
<p>Okay. When you submit a name, guides get a message with that name and the class/race of the person submitting it, and they get to click approve or no way Jose. When the same class/race submits a bunch of lame names in a row, they get suspicious. Sometimes, if they've been ordered to, they let one in, and pounce on the poor bastard. While I personally think naming yourself Poptart shows a certain lack of ORIGINALITY and CLASS, I question the priority level Verant assigns to name issues.</p>

<p class="yellow">QUESTION: Can you help all us guides out and make a more concise list of your personal knowledge of bugs and fuckups?</p>
<p>I do have a personal list. BUT - the fun part - my list might not be valid on your server. What's "verified" to my GM might not be for yours. The only ones verified for all servers are in your policy guide. All fucking two of them. The best thing to do is to ask the other guides on your server for their lists, so you can give all the players on your server consistency. The lack of consistency is what fucks guides nine out of ten times - one guide will rezz someone, and the next petitioner from the same goddam group gets a different response.</p>

<p class="yellow">QUESTION: What's the deal with the /con messages? There is no disclaimer that says blue means you need three people to take this mob out unless one of them is a necro in which case he can handle the pimply assed thing himself and don't need you.</p>
<p>My opinion is that Verant, when they designed the game, had no idea what tactics the different classes would come up with. (Witness monks and feign pulling - they had no CLUE people would think of that.) Various forms of kiting were likely never dreamed of. Which is why you're supposed to beta test for more than a day with testers besides Uncle Clampett and your brother in law, dipshits. Didn't you listen to the people who tested in open beta? Jumping jesus on a pogo stick.</p>

<p class="yellow">QUESTION: Why the morbid fascination with male masturbation? ...Every rant implies that men play the game with only one hand.</p>
<p>Typing one handed is the only excuse I can come up with for the lousy spelling, the incoherent petitions, and lack of long-term thinking so rampant in Norrath. With a player base so overwhelmingly male, odds are good I'm right sometimes. I wish you people could see the 35 year old refugee fromThe Simpson's comic book shop actually playing that hot female wood elf.</p>

<p class="yellow">I got banned (albeit temporarily) for reporting someone exploiting in a room I happened to be fighting in. The GM showed up and banned everybody there. Verant even admitted the logs showed I wasn't exploiting, but it took two days for my account to be reinstated.</p>
<p>Sigh, I can't believe I got a response from my dare so fast. All I can say is, with the pittance GM's are paid, the way they are treated, the fact that most of them are considered temps by the company, etc - sometimes they make bad choices. Like guides, the GMs are human and make mistakes, and people who are poorly trained often jump to dumb fucking conclusions. As for the lag in your reinstatement -it would help if everyone knew that at Verant, there's like one or two people that handle reinstatements and suchlike. They can't always react as fast as we want/deserve. I'm not excusing a damn thing, I'm trying to explain with very limited information.</p>

<p class="yellow">QUESTION: How do guides find me, even when I log on a twink?</p>
<p>You are located by your station name. Yes, you funny people using VerantSuxx0r as your station name are in fact known. While I'm always up for a good Verant bashing, be aware that I see station names like that and automatically suspect that you've been banned - and that this is your new, second account. And that you might not have learned not to be a prick.</p>

<p class="yellow">QUESTION: Why is there no "verified bug list," so I don't send a petition asking for a rezz I can't have?</p>
<p>Answer: It is felt that if people know, they will drag their corpses to the location a verified-bug-death corpse will appear. And that would be cheating. And everyone knows the players are all cheaters. Excuse me while I go throw up. If it's any comfort, the guides aren't allowed to have a list either, because everyone knows the guides are all cheaters. That's why you get inconsistency - because each guide only knows about the verified bugs either another guide told them about, or something they died to themselves.</p>
