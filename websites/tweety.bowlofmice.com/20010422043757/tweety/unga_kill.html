<p>I think it's safe to say most game designers don't come from deprived backgrounds. They come from homes in which computers were available, and other high tech gadgets and toys. At minimum, at some point, the artists that bring us our entertainment confections were exposed to the intersection of art and technology, and were comfortable setting up shop in that zone.</p>
<p>It's also safe to say that we the players of these games are likewise privileged. While some of us may be scarfing ramen so we can continue to pay for our high speed connections and system upgrades, the fact is that any home with a nearly state of the art computer and an internet connection is not a poor one. Even if Everquest or Asheron's Call or Ultima Online or Obsessing Over Unreleased Games And Talking Smack on Bulletin Boards is the only thing we can afford to do for fun, we aren't missing any meals.</p>
<p>The fact is, the amount of wealth implied by the very existence of the gaming community at large is impressive. We have powerful machines, the income to pay for our entertainment, the internet connection to support our habits, and the leisure time to pour into the black hole of time suckage that is MMOGaming. And we are so wealthy that an entire segment of the entertainment industry has evolved solely to cater to our pleasure preferences. Right now, as you toil away in your cubicles, someone is getting paid to draw pictures of monsters and dungeons solely because of the money you have to burn.</p>
<p>We are all privileged. We are comfortable, secure, and educated. The younger members of our communities are ensconced in solid schools, the adults are mostly college educated and employed in demanding fields. We've had access to every advantage that middle class upbringings and school systems have to offer.</p>
<p>So why the hell are people so fucking stupid?</p>
<p>Is it our schools? We're paying for the touchy feely bullshit of the seventies and early eighties, where we switched from phonics to whole language to organic writing to spelling drills to whatever fad of the month. How are we paying for it? The kids who tried to learn to read in that morass of insanity grew up, and now they're running the asylum. Now it's the teachers walking tall and standing proud even though they can't communicate in their native language any better than a first generation immigrant from East Bumfuck Asia.</p>
<p>Is it societal? I love the self-esteem people - oh, sweet baby jesus, don't ever imply that a kid is shit kicking ignorant and needs to spend a few hours mastering the alphabet or he might FEEL BAD. Only a product of this bastardized excuse for an educational institution could say "Don't make fun of my speling - your the stupid one if you don't know what I ment" and be proud of it. </p>
<p>Is it an inherent part of the community? Every time I bash the helpless baby of d00dsp34k, I get at least one email from someone pointing out that it's actually harder to type with numbers AND letters, and that the resulting "language" is actually a legitimate form of expression, as it serves to define and delineate a community. Funny, I heard this excuse when Ebonics first became a buzzword (well, not FIRST, this abomination FIRST became popular among certain fuzzy brained hemp ingesters in the sixties), and I thought it was a great big bucket of wombat spit then. But, but, it must be a language because it follows certain patterns and rules! Fine, it's CONSISTENTLY wrong, that's terrific. It's still wrong. It makes the situation even sadder - the speakers of this "language" have proven they can master intricate rules and patterns, and so they're CHOOSING not to have a clue in standard English.</p>
<p>If I'm this disturbed over ignorant gamers, imagine what happens to my blood pressure when I come across "Your not welcome here" in a game purportedly created by some of the best and brightest creative minds around.</p>
<p>We are, in so many ways, the elite of our society, with our educations, careers, advantages, and wealth. Yet the level of literacy in this privileged strata drops with every passing year. It begs the question, how will the disadvantaged members of our culture communicate in years to come?</p>
<p>"Unga want. Unga kill."</p>
<p>Holy shit, we're all turning into roleplaying ogres.</p>
