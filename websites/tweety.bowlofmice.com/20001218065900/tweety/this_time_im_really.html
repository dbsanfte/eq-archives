<p>Do any of you ever read Stephen King and think, "Ew, what a messed up motherfucker. Glad I don't live in HIS head. Yuck"? Next question - do any of you actually think Stephen King DOES the stuff he writes about? Should he be arrested for the scene in "It" where the twelve year old heroine has sex with her five best friends? Should he be prevented from writing because he graphically describes scenes of rape in "Rose Madder"? How about the scenes of molestation, abuse, and gore? Should he be punished because his imagination is capable of exploring a dark side of humanity that most people turn away from in horror?</p>
<p>According to Verant, the answer is yes. Mystere, a roleplayer on the Brell server, has been banned for a roleplaying story written on July 11, 2000. This story and others by the same person is linked on Lum's page, if y'all want to take a gander at them. </p>
<p>Full and honest disclosure: I'm not linking to the infamous story, because I am personally revolted by it. The tale is well written, with evocative language and a truly evil scenario. I don't like it for the same reason that I occasionally can't finish stories by Stephen King - I am not able to judge such material objectively. Too many personal buttons get pushed when I read about certain topics, and my horror outweighs the entertainment factor.</p>
<p>However, "free speech" does not mean "nice friendly speech everyone can agree on." Mystere has the right to say whatever the hell he wants to. ESPECIALLY AS A WRITER AND AN ARTIST. You people have no idea how many emails I get that say, "Thanks for saying XYZ, I wish I could have said it as well" and "That's exactly how I feel, I just couldn't express it." No one would read literature, tales, or rant sites if everyone was capable of expressing themselves via the written word. A writer performs a necessary service to humanity, by forming an idea or concept and putting it out there for everyone to share. When that service is suppressed, anyone who might have shared that thought or concept is also being suppressed. </p>
<p>I'm not putting me and my rantsite, or Mystere's ideas, up along with Thomas Paine or Galileo by any means. What I'm suggesting is that the slippery slope is long and might break your fucking legs if you start down it. Why was this person banned? This is on Lum's board as well, but just in case I have readers that don't frequent Lum (inconceivable!):</p>
<p class="yellow">"I called CS and was eventually passed on to George Scotto, the directory of Customer Service for EverQuest. I was told that the story I had written had been passed on to them. I was told that the story was sickening and disturbing in the extreme. I was told that some council of some sort had made the decision to ban me, and said decision is immutable (George is the last in the line for appeals). The post had "many" customers up in arms and they don't need "players like (me)."</p>
<p>What players, first of all? The original story was posted on JULY 11. Jumping Jesus on a pogo stick, this is nearly three months ago. NO EQ player has an attention span of three months. My sordid tale is all of a month and a half old, and damn near everyone has already forgotten. (Which, by the way, is as it should be - it's a video game, for god's sake. If it affects anyone other than me or my friends, that "anyone" probably needs some fresh air.) I categorically refuse to believe that THREE MONTHS LATER, angry Norrathian citizens are still storming the Verant barricades over a short story posted to a rarely frequented private board. Jeez, even when it was posted the number of comments didn't exceed a page or two. I would venture to say that the number of people who even knew it was there is under fifty. Or it was, until this happened. </p>
<p>One point mentioned by some people is that perhaps Verant banned this writer because they are concerned that someone might think (a la the mass hysteria regarding Dungeons and Dragons fifteen years ago with demons etc.) that EQ condones child abuse. ROFL. Admittedly, the flap over DND affected some otherwise normal people. My parents were two of them, I had to pretend to join the (GAG) Girl Scouts just to get an excuse to vanish every so often for a campaign. But no one, and I do mean no one who knew anything about DND thought the "demon-worshipping" bit was anything but laughable. And EQ is marketed at adults. Their precious EULA is very clear on that subject. But, okay, maybe they were trying to avoid negative publicity.</p>
<p>By banning this guy, everyone and their dog is going to check out that "bad" story. People with no clue about EQ at all are going to read that story, and jump to amazingly WRONG conclusions about Mystere, dark elves, and EQ in general. I repeat, NO ONE would have heard of the story beyond Mystere and his friends unless Verant did something like ban him and have it blown out of proportion. Way to go, public relations fucksticks!! That mail-away diploma wasn't nearly as helpful as you thought it would be, eh?</p>
<p>He's a talented writer, however, and deserved a wider audience, so I guess something good will come out of this. I implore you guys to read other things he wrote, though. Judging him by one story would be like reading Romeo and Juliet and saying, "That Shakespeare, what a scumbag. He only wrote about fourteen year old children having sex, stabbing their friends with daggers, and then killing themselves." Fourteen!!?? He wrote about fourteen year old kids killing other people and themselves?? Hang him! (If you haven't read the Bad Story, the heroine is fourteen seasons old, and even though she is horribly brutalized, she winds up killing her tormentor in an even more brutal fashion. To get my sarcasm, you need to know that in Romeo and Juliet, Juliet's father says "She hath not seen the change of fourteen years." His friend later replies "Younger than she are happy mothers made." Romeo (who is indirectly responsible for his best friend's murder, so he hunts down the teenaged killer, stabs him with a dagger and kills him), was older than Juliet by a year. They get married, and have a traditional wedding night which is just barely left to the imagination. In the end he drinks poison, dies, and then Juliet stabs herself in despair. See, a couple hundred years ago, fourteen year olds were adults…)</p>
<p>It doesn't even matter WHAT the hell you think of Mystere, or his writing. It was fictional. It was anonymous ("Mystere" is as real as "Tweety"). It was posted to an private message board not affiliated with Verant in any way. According to a few of his friends who have written to me, he never roleplayed anything like his darkest scenario in game. The story in question barely makes reference to EQ at all, except to say "Neriak" and "Innoruuk" in the last sentence. There is absolutely nothing that justifies banning this customer, even if "the council" was morally outraged by the story.</p>
<p>And guess what else. It doesn't matter. No sane player is going to waste money contacting a lawyer over a video game, so Verant is going to keep right on acting like the fascist arrogant assholes they've been since last fall, right on the mud wimping schedule. There have never been any consequences to treating players like anal tampons.</p>
<p>No, it doesn't matter. Or does it? Are you willing to email jsmedley@verant.com over this? How about gscotto@verant.com, who ultimately made the decision? If you were thinking about leaving Norrath, have you considered ebaying your gear, and then canceling with a note to both of those gentlemen with WHY you're quitting? Are you willing to send a link to this article, and Lum's, to every single gaming news and straight news site in existence? Got any contacts in more traditional news sources? Why not email some links to them?</p>
<p>I'm asking y'all to raise hell. I didn't ask that you do that on my behalf, because there was some gray area in my case (there WAS a rule that could apply to me). There is no gray area here. It is just plain wrong.</p>
