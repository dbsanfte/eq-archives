<p> You had to know I was going to get to Ebay eventually. Before I start, let's toss out the EULA. I KNOW Verant says it's a no-no. Look at their actions, though, not their words. With a crack legal team taking care of such critical issues as whether or not a guide's actions can affect their player account, don't you think one of their dewy eyed young lawyers could have picked up the phone and said, "Hello, Ebay? Um, selling stuff is against our rules and stuff, it says right here on this sticky note that the stuff isn't really theirs to sell. So how about taking down the section, mmmkay?" Ebay shuts down illegal sales all the time. The fact that they have not ceased to display MMORPG items and characters means it is in fact perfectly legal.</p>
<p>What are the ethics of selling your character? Well, everyone is entitled to their own opinion. I happen to think that if a guild got you your spiffy armor and weapon, you should offer that guild first crack at your stuff. After that, though, slap on that sign that says FOR SALE BY OWNER. Game, 50 dollars. Monthly fee, 10 dollars. Your time at minimum wage, 5.25 an hour. The look on your wife's face when you tell her you got the monkey off your back: PRICELESS.</p>
<p>How about buying that nifty item you'll never have time to camp in a million years? We're not sliding down that slippery slope, we're fucking parasailing off that bad boy. I think this falls into the "okay" area, though. You're not ever going to see a dragon, you've got an extra 500 beans, and you're enough of a loser to think that Cloak of Flaming Asshole is going to make you "better" somehow - it's your life. Go buck.</p>
<p>At some point the slippery slope becomes the flat expanse of Loserville. For me, that line falls at the spot where you buy a level 50+ character because you're too lazy to actually play the game. You bought the booklet with the cheater codes for your Nintendo because you wanted to skip straight to level 200, what's the difference? The difference, you short bus riding, airplane glue huffing DIPSHIT, is with Nintendo it's just you and your spank sock. Your total cluelessness and selfishness affect no one but you. In the world of EQ, shit ain't like that. Here, you're going to cause a four hour CR because you're too dumb to screw your wife and whistle Dixie at the same time.</p>
<p>We've all got stories - the guy in full rubi who asked your warrior character for a SoW, the 49th cleric getting hysterical because he couldn't find the hot button that had "Rez" printed on it, the monk asking "Well, how do you set up a hot button?" when you asked if he had a CR hot button bank set. These people are harmless. These morons are the equivalent of a cocktail party joke, whose sole purpose on this earth is to give you a cute anecdote for the message boards.</p>
<p>What I'm talking about here is the Jerry's Kid who was helping my group farm some exp at Chardok one sunny day. Here comes Mr. Lizard! Uh, oh, here comes Mr. Lizard's friend. And his second cousin Larry. And apparently Uncle Bob. Looks like the monk had a bad pull, good thing we have an enchanter. We pick off one of the now frozen lizards - who immediately beats the shit out of the enchie. The cleric saves the enchie! Yay Cleric! We choose another lizard. The monk gets his attention with a couple good kicks for 100+, but then the ROGUE steps in. POW, 200 right in the tail. That's gotta hurt! Good thing we have a warrior! The cleric heals the rogue and the monk, and the next thing you know, Mr. Cleric has three lizards crawling up his anal cavity heading straight for his esophagus. The Master of Melee, I mean the monk, is pounding furiously on the original lizard, screeching "TAUNT PLEASE," the rogue is making typical rogue sounds such as "Urk" and "Ow, my ass," the cleric is now flashing back to his younger days when he first discovered that healing is the ultimate taunt, the enchanter has successfully gotten the attention of one of the lizards and can't get a mezz off, and the only one at full health is the... warrior? The 51st level ogre? Huh?</p>
<p>Three hours later (the cleric had cast bind in Burning Woods, but... there's this bug in Kunark, where sometimes your bind doesn't WORK, but SHHH, that's not verified or anything) we get back together. While we strolled back to our corpses, we discussed our apparent failure to cope with a simple overpull. We realize that at some point something had broken mezz in an ugly fashion. A little discussion determines that our warrior was using the cursor to select monsters, and when mezz didn't break on his first one right away, he turned to another. The monk, blindly pounding the assist key, hadn't noticed. It happens. Oh well. But why did the first lizard immediately climb onto the enchie and start thrusting with no lube? Why did our reptile friends almost never turn to the reservoir of hit points in the form of a fatty? "Next time, try choosing a target and taunting it before you attack," suggests the monk, who has no earthly clue what she's talking about, but her roommate is a warrior. </p>
<p>"How do you taunt?" says the warrior.</p>
<p>Pause.</p>
<p>"Man, my wife is screaming, I gotta go," says the cleric. "Hey guys, I got some friends who want me to come hit the Efreeti," says the monk. "Out of food and water already? Damn! I gotta head to town" says the enchie. The rogue says nothing, having degrouped in the pause.</p>
<p>This game has taken over a significant portion of the web. Bookstores carry clue books written by gamers out for a fast buck. The Official Players Guide might be old, but still contains a wealth of pertinent information. READ SOME. Also, you brain dead fuckstick, ask for advice. It's only going to take one stunt like that before we realize the ogre we knew and loved is under new management. See, once you get to fifty, the game becomes difficult. The skills you learned in the previous six months become the difference between life and death. While you're picking Cheetos out of your keyboard, the rest of us are trying to hang on to the four pixels of exp that took us three weeks to earn. Here's a hint - if you smell shit all the time, your head is up your ass.</p>
