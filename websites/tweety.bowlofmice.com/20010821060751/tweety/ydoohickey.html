<p>/ooc What's a doohickey for?</p>
<p>You take a breather from the euphoria of soloing yellows and seeing your exp bar bounce up a blue or more with each kill and answer, like the no foresight having dickcheese you are. The Doohickey Quest, you say, and you return to rat whacking.</p>
<p>/ooc Where do you get the quest?</p>
<p>As you engage the vicious attack orc, you're overcome by a paternal impulse. After all, you were once a hapless newbie, and it sure would have been nice if someone could have extended a helping hand to you. Captain Doohickey, you say, as you deftly polish off the monster and loot the pick.</p>
<p>/ooc Where can I get more doohickeys?</p>
<p>Kill the guys carrying doohickeys, you reply, as you rearrange your backpacks while you med. You look proudly over your assortment of rodent ears and bone chips. You could drop a thousand plat on this character, but it's so much fun earning the loot.</p>
<p>/ooc Where are those guys?</p>
<p>You bounce back to your feet, marveling at how fast you get mana back. They spawn a little away from the newbie yard, you need to level a few more times before you can take them, you answer.</p>
<p>/ooc Can someone give me a doohickey?</p>
<p>You pause in disgust before you engage a creature that happens to drop doohickeys. No, it's more fun if you get the doohickeys yourself, you type out in annoyance. Players that previously were minding their own rat whacking pipe up in support of you, and the conversation briefly turns to which level is worse, 45 or 54.</p>
<p>/ooc Hey, what's this about doohickeys? I just looted one.</p>
<p>Great, someone new is piping up. The Doohickey quest from Captain Doohickey, you state in a firm tone as you retreat to the guards with your little train. Have you ever looked on the web for these quests?</p>
<p>/ooc But I'm not big enough to kill doohickey mobs!</p>
<p>You crouch in a little bleeding pile of lowbie and contemplate your need for more AC. Then level a little more, you'll be big enough in three more levels. That's tops a half an hour, be patient. Here, have a free doohickey, that'll get you started.</p>
<p>/ooc Can someone give me a backpack?</p>
<p>You go back to killing, wondering why Verant had to sell a ten dollar version of the game at the exact time school was letting out for the summer. You didn't get your first backpack until freaking level 8, and that was dozens of whisker hoarding batwing looting bone chip collecting forays into your EQ career. I'll *give* you an idea, kill stuff, loot it, sell the loot, and buy a damn backpack, you call out.</p>
<p>/ooc That sux, you got lots of stuff and I don't have anything.</p>
<p>You ask your guild if EQ was suddenly relocated to behind the Iron Curtain and back in time thirty years. When the answer is no, you answer with well, I earned all my stuff, and it's really easy, and you can too. Less talking, more killing, more stuff, got it?</p>
<p>/ooc Hey, I can't find any doohickey mobs!</p>
<p>You look at the train of doohickey mobs you're currently leading back to the guards and refuse to dignify that with a response.</p>
<p>Newbass is inspecting your equipment.</p>
<p>/ooc Hey, gimme a doohickey!</p>
<p>What the fuck is wrong with you people? There are entire websites devoted to explaining doohickeys, there are a hundred different zones filled with seven billion different kinds of doohickeys, and you're surrounded by over two thousand people in the pursuit of life liberty and shiny new doohickeys. What is so hard about target, auto attack, hotkey hotkey hotkey, loot, sell, rinse, repeat? In case you missed the clue bus, that's how you get money and experience. There is no experience fairy.</p>
<p>I've healed you, I've sowed you, I've led your sorry lost ass through the hills and right up Captain Doohickey's lower intestines and you're still standing there whining at me. You see this gear I'm wearing? I got it by sitting on my ass eating microwave burritos for two years, what in the name of a vengeful god makes you think I should just hand you some?</p>
<p>Do you think I'm some kind of goddam quest NPC who lives to answer the same stupid question nine million times? Where in any of my replies did you see brackets indicating that you just need to rephrase your request before I hand you something? I'm another player, you self centered dillhole, not a fucking piñata. You want to whack something and get loot, look for something animal shaped with no guild tag. I'm not your bitch. I don't look in the mirror and see Santa Claus. The only way you're getting my doohickey is if you drop to your knees in real life and start sucking, and that's never going to happen because I don't have health insurance, so get the hell away from me you mongoloid droolwhore!</p>
<p>/ooc Okay, can I have some plat instead?</p>
