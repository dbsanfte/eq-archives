<p>I was a theatre major. The main way you can tell is I use the pretentious British spelling instead of using the American "theater." Anyway, I was sitting back, reliving my glorious days as a $150/week stage manager, watching tapes of my old shows. The Man of La Mancha - good old Don Quixote, tilting at windmills. I was inspired! I got back on the horse, and tried to find someone who might answer my questions about my poor little Everquest player account. I had already called Verant and asked to speak to a legal eagle, but the front line trooper categorically refused to transfer me. "Why?" "What can I do to help?" None of your damn business, and nothing, minion. Anyway.</p>
<p>First, I called Sony, headquartered in New York City. I told the nice lady I needed to speak to someone in the Sony Computer Entertainment division, and she provided me with a phone number. Next, I called Sony Computer Entertainment. The first woman I spoke with hadn't heard of Everquest or Verant. Um… well, she finally transferred me. This guy had heard of Everquest, but didn't know Sony had anything to do with them. I had to be a little insistent to get transferred again, but I was. The last woman did know about Sony's acquisition of the Little Company That Could. </p>
<p>Me: To whom should I speak regarding an unsatisfactory experience with Verant? I have been unable to resolve this with the company itself, and since you own them, I thought perhaps you could suggest an avenue for me to pursue. </p>
<p>Sony Lady: Oh, we don't do anything about that stuff.</p>
<p>Me: Pardon? Don't you own them?</p>
<p>Sony Lady: Well, yeah, but they're totally independent. We just bought them. Try calling this number (which turns out to be a fax machine).</p>
<p>Well, shit! You can buy a company, and make pots of money off the product or service that they provide, but not be accountable for their fuckups and inability to tie their shoes without drooling on their socks? Where do I sign up for that free lunch?</p>
<p>What the fuck is wrong with this picture? The question before us, fellow masochists, is why are game companies immune from normal business practices? If I buy a toaster, and upon plugging it in and inserting bread it fails to provide me with toast, I take the damn thing and the receipt of purchase back to the store. If the gum chewing redneck with six kids behind the service counter fails to provide me with a new toaster, I find a manager. If she fails to give me a new toaster, I find the store manager. If that bloated son of a bitch with the ludicrous combover fails to give me a toaster, I go home and write a nasty letter to the company, and refuse to enter their store again. Then I call the maker of the rotten toaster, and politely request a new one. They fall over themselves apologizing, and after I mail them their piece of shit, they mail me a new toaster. By now, of course, I've long since said fuck this and eaten a bagel, but that is beside the point. </p>
<p>Accountability is one of a customer's favorite things. They want to know who ultimately bears responsibility for a product or service. They want a clearly defined chain of authority to follow in the event that they are disappointed by the thing they paid for. The trouble with internet companies is we can't find the pointy haired schmuck with the cutesy wutesy button reading "The buck stops HERE!" Why won't Verant or OSI tell us who's really in charge? None of these worthless loose holed skanky ass sperm gurgling whores seem to have anyone that they answer to. Their pimps all live three states away, content to take a monthly check without ever bothering to check their bitches for VD.
What are they afraid of? Why won't anyone take or make phone calls? It wouldn't be an issue if they actually answered email. Which they don't, so a better question: Why won't they communicate with customers except by the means over which they have total control? Why is a good customer a powerless one? 
</p>
<p>Dear Sony: I WANT MY FUCKING TOASTER, AND I WON'T GO AWAY.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, this bagel is delicious. It's unfortunate that the cream cheese is vaporware at this time.</p>
