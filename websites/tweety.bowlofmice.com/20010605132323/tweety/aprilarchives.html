<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE 4/27/01</p>    
<p>Message boards are not unlike compost pits. People toss out whatever they happen to be thinking about, and the layers slowly build up on themselves. After awhile, a community uses old threads to define context for current discussions. Then you get new visitors going through the old threads and flipping them back to the top layers so we can all see what has rotted and what has refused to decompose.</p>
<p>The picture of Firiona Vie (on the new Shadows of Luclin extension of the Official EQ site) BLINKS AT ME. For those of you that hang out in the #lummies IRC channel, you'll note that this has been disturbing me all day. Lum gave us a perfectly reasonable explanation (the elf's body is a jpg, but her face is an animated gif file), but I don't care. It BLINKED at me. It's coming to take me away, ha ha, hee hee, ho ho.</p>
<p>Also on my list of disturbing things is the reactions to the Traveler's boots, currently for sale on the Test server. Some people will whine about any fucking thing, and I think I'll prove it by whining about people whining. Catch y'all next week.</p>   
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE 4/24/01</p>   
<p>I am trying (ow) very hard to write (eek) this update (yeeouch), but the dogs refuse to understand that (wince) they shouldn't put their paws on me when I'm typing (gasp). Man, these bitches need their claws trimmed.
<p>The fraternity reunion was a hoot as always. I'm getting to be that age, where the men are losing hair and getting a little thick around the middle. The women stand around complaining about cellulite. And both sexes whip out baby pictures at the drop of a hat. Or a shot glass. We're also young enough to try and prove we can still stand beer mug to beer mug with eighteen year olds. Notice I said "try." I said very little about "succeeding." However, despite the aging carcass, I still had three base hits in the alumni-active softball game. Sure, I strained a shoulder proving that "you throw like a girl" is a compliment, but it was worth it to see the recipient of my throw wince and put a glove on.</p>
<p>The rant I had planned isn't terribly coherent at the moment, as I keep getting up to do laundry. I'll try to toss it up tomorrow or Wednesday. Hope you all are enjoying the decent weather sweeping the nation. Get off the computer right now, and go sun yourself for a minute. Nothing you're doing is so crucial that it can't wait five minutes while you remind yourself that you're alive.</p>   
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE 4/20/01</p>
<p>Well, my computer skills are about to be seriously tested. One of my roommates, and the owner of this domain, is moving out and returning to school down south. This means my speech-activated HTML resource has left the building, and I'm on my own as far as making this site work.</p>
<p>The two remaining residents are now looking for a roommate. Since we're looking for a dog person that smokes, plays computer games semi-obsessively and willing to wire into our LAN, male, and someone we are already friends with, our options are somewhat limited. I'm too damn old to want to live with a stranger. The idea makes me feel like I'm eighteen and moving into a dorm. And I was NOT GOOD AT ROOMMATES. I was semi-famous at Greensboro College for getting rid of roommates. The housing code had a loophole - private rooms cost extra, but if your roommate moved out, you could keep the single room at a double's price. Housing offices being what they are, they managed to assign people to me that were easy to chase out. (Neat freak non-smoking morning people. With ME.) My senior year, they gave up and gave me the free private room.</p>
<p>So, how about that EQ patch? Wowzers. With the exception of the muffin nerf (those are now SNACKS, and you plow through them at three times the rate of water), every single other thing listed was thoughtful, useful, and in some cases, miraculous. And they're working on the unfortunately acronymed Shadows of Luclin. Heh, and you people thought you'd be able to walk away. Raise your hands if you just decided to stick it out and try out a cat person avatar. SLUUUUUURP.</p>
<p>I'm getting ready to go out of town, and I've got nothing to bitch about. If you need a laugh, think of me wearing a formal gown, drinking liquor in a vain attempt to recapture my graduate school days, and singing 99 Red Balloons with other overdressed aging dorks. Yep, it's a fraternity reunion.</p>   
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE 4/16/01</p>
<p>For every rant, I have an email inquiring as to whether or not I'm having my time of the month. And for every one of those, I have an email from someone who still thinks I'm male. So either I'm a really funny man who tells it like it is with style, or I'm a dumb bitch on the rag. I find the discrepancy amusing. I was intentionally generalizing in last week's rant to make a broad point, folks. Some very special helmet wearing people need to stop eating glue. Somehow I doubt that my rant site about a video game played primarily by men would be doing ten thousand hits a week if I hated men.</p>
<p>I saw an interesting quote on a message board. "Rebecca West once said: I myself have never been able to find out precisely what feminism is. I only know that people call me a feminist whenever I express sentiments that differentiate me from a doormat or a prostitute."</p>
<p>Speaking of boards, mine is insane. This is technically a site about computer games and the people that inhabit them - but apparently EQ players are really, really desperate to talk about other stuff. If you haven't checked it out, please bring your asbestos suit and all your wits. Stupid people don't last long enough to be regulars. If you're a conservative and haven't visited because you're afraid you would need to be a bleeding heart liberal like myself, fear not. If my moderator were any more right wing, he'd fly in circles.</p>
<p>No new rant for the day, I've been reading a series called The Fey by Kristine Rusch, and it's gotten me completely sucked in. I'm almost done with the fifth book, though, so I'll be back later this week.</p>
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE 4/13/01</p>
<p>Argh! No more Evercrest? It's true, Drysart has left the building. The costs of running a high bandwidth site has claimed another victim. He's also a busy guy, being the producer of Fallen Age and all that. Go pay tribute to him, check out the game. I'm too lazy to make a link, Lum has one somewhere.</p>
<p>So, I get an email telling me I finally have the mark of fame on my brow - I have some two bit impersonator. Apparently there was a dingbat in the IGN boards pretending to be a certain Bird, arguing with morons, and blatantly ripping off my material. Okay, no offense or anything, but even I have standards, and I wouldn't stoop to arguing with nimrods on the IGN VNBoards. If I have ranting to do, I do it right here. If I want to read message boards, I read my old server board, my guild board, and my own fucking board. If I want to get into an argument with some half wit and demonstrate the superiority gained from actually finishing a whole book without resorting to Cliff Notes and Books On Tape, I'll… no, I wouldn't! Please! Kicking a paralyzed dog after it's been drugged is more challenging!</p>
<p>So, anyway, here's that rant I promised. Have a good weekend.</p>   
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE 4/11/01</p>
<p>Mercy, this week is flying past. I've got a whole bunch of love for you soon, but my plans to upload the new rant have been derailed by my need to sleep.</p>
<p>I got a gander at <a href="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/forum/everquest/showflat.pl?Cat=1,2,3,4,5&Board=eqwestwood&Number=500532&page=0&view=collapsed&sb=5">some stuff on the Test Server</a>, and boy, I nearly peed my britches. Food? They're fine tuning FOOD? What, did someone realize how UNBALANCING muffins were after TWO YEARS? I'm sure bakers will appreciate their services being value added, but again, why not improve something without nerfing an existing element? It's nice to know that TUNING FOOD is such a major priority. Those pesky falling for 32K bugs must be unimportant. And the four hour server self-destruct I witnessed my roommate wrestling with, that's not nearly as important with the one game element that has been working perfectly since inception in need of tuning. I'd get even more wound up, but Lum put things into perspective for me. "Well, bear in mind it doesn't say 'we're going to nerf the shit out of muffins.' That's merely implied. MAYBE MUFFINS WILL MAKE YOU CONSTIPATED. YOU WILL LOSE DEXTERITY AND CHARISMA." And hey, to make up for the Tailoring Kit Weight of Death (you know, I HAVE a real life tailoring kit, a Craftsman box with patented Step On Sit On Heavy Duty Lid, and that fucker doesn't weigh four pounds), monks may get to weigh an extra penalty free pound for each fifteen levels completed. Yet again, my reaction to Verant's proposed "fixes" can be summed up as a big warm hug followed by a knee to the nuts.</p>
<p>Bah, tune in tomorrow for some gender related bitching. (Thursday: Real life is a bitch, TTY Friday)</p>   
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE 4/6/01</p>
<p>I no longer wonder why traffic is so horrible in Washington. It's because most people would rather gnaw off an arm than ride public transportation. You'd think the Metro yellow line was a Japanese commuter special, the way people shove and fight to get on the crowded train - except it wouldn't BE crowded if these fucking Mensas would let disembarking passengers out first. I kept hoping the blind guy would start swinging his cane around. No such luck.</p>
<p>How about that change to the trade bags, huh? It was a good change in a lot of ways, kind of like seat belt laws are good. Protect people from being morons so they can breed more! No, seriously, getting your stuff back if you guess wrong on a recipe is good. Preventing the loss of valuable loot when you lag out with the cursor over the combine button is good. But why make the bags heavier? Couldn't they give out a present without adding a negative element? Is it POSSIBLE for Verant to make an improvement without also shoving a broomstick so far up our collective ass that it comes out our nose? The weight change doesn't hurt anyone but low level monks who can't afford tink bags and crafters. Guess those silly crafters and lowbies don't matter as much as the uber crew.</p>
<p>Lord, I need a real job. I can feel myself getting stupider with every day I spend not using the brain that used to write conference papers. Today's Word, brought to you by the U.S. Government, is "definitalization." It's not a word, goddammit, so why did I have to type it twenty billion times into a database no one will ever look at? Your tax dollars at work - I am making copies of documents, so I can print out descriptions of the documents, so they can be scanned onto a CD, so we can SAVE PAPER.</p>
<p>At least I had plenty of spare brain cells left to write today's rant. Have a good weekend, gang.</p>
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE 4/3/01</p>
<p>Man, the Everquest April Fool's joke was pretty good. (For those of you who do not compulsively read websites, the gag appeared to be the removal of /anon and /roleplay from the game "to make it easier for players to locate clerics, druids, and wizards." That was the nerf; the improvement was going to be a little plus or minus sign indicating your willingness to help strangers. The little sign NOT being visible when one typed /who all targetofspam.) What made it such a good stunt? It was entirely plausible. A large percentage of players were willing to believe Verant would put in a completely unwanted, undesirable change that could serve no purpose but to make the players miserable.</p>
<p>Why this is funny escapes me.</p>
<p>Props to Flicker the Mad Coyote for fixing my stupid yellow monitor problem. While many of you kindly emailed me your suggestions and advice, for which I thank you, Flicker's tip on removing the dust from the inside of the monitor was the one that worked. That's a couple hundred bucks I can now spend on cheap wine and cigarettes.</p>
<p>Time to rant! See y'all later on.</p>
