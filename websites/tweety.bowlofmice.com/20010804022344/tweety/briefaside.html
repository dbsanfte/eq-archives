<p>In a (unrelated) conversation earlier today, I said, "Most Americans are actually fairly understanding semi-reasonable individuals (I said semi). As a group however, we're a sleek, well oiled, highly destructive blob of dumb-ass."</p>
<p>I don't know why, but I like that statement.  I felt it deserved to be repeated here.  The context is unimportant, as it probably applies to many conversations.</p>
<p>It's what I like about us, and why 'A Brief aside' will always be, in my mind, a truly American form of communication. Am I a semi-intelligent individual, or just a cog in one of the wheels of the giant blob of dumb-ass?</p>
<p>What's the difference?  Wherever this boat is going, were bound to get there sooner or later, lets just enjoy the ride and stop bitching so much about how much of an ass our neighbors are.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>...And yes.  My neighbor IS an ass.  So is yours, welcome to America.

<p>Hemp Car!
<p>For those of you who haven't heard, the Hemp Car(tm) is now touring America! This marvel of modern technology is actually powered primarily by fuel made from hemp.  Not the "smoke em if you got em" brand, but the industrial "executive" hemp is used to power this little wonder of technology.
<p>This dream of modern farming, I think, will never revolutionize our current energy dilemma.  For one thing, just think of the children!  We can't grow hemp...we have to think of the children!
<p>You know, being an American, I see American children every day.  Hundreds of them.  Whiny, snot nosed, back talking, arrogant, gun toting little bastards.
<p>Fuck em! I want hemp car!

<p>Did you know Dr. Kevorkian is still in jail?  60 minutes did a segment about him this week (so why shouldn't I jump on the bandwagon while the seat is still warm?).  For those who didn't give a flying rats ass until this very moment, I shall fill you in on what has happened so far:
<p>Kevorkian made a career out of helping people die.  If they were terminally ill, in pain, one step from being vegetables (which would be fruits I guess...probably why the Republicans never tried to stop him) he would set up a little stand with drugs on it, with a little button.  Patient pushes button, patient dies.  Suicide really, but painless and a trained doctor sets up the contraption for you.
<p>Not really legal, but they pretty much ignored him, since he only did it to people that everyone felt sorry for and only the criminally stupid among politicians are willing to attack the wishes of the disabled.
<p>Then, along comes patient with Lou Gerrig disease.  Unable to push the button for himself, Kevorkian has to administer the shot (which everyone agrees is safer and more humane anyway).  He videotapes it.  Tells the patient he wont do it for a week, that he has to think about it.  The next night the patients brother calls Kevorkian..the patient, barely able to talk is begging to be put down.  He is terrified of choking to death (a possibility that is becoming more and more imminent).
<p>The doctor administers the shot... the patient dies.
<p>The police say "damn shame" and go about their business.  
<p>Kevorkian calls the news, wanting the issue to be heard, and gets his wish. He is put on trial for murder...the patients wishes are never discussed in the trial, only whether or not the doctor was involved, he is found guilty and sent to prison.
<p>Two years later, he's still in prison, not allowed to see reporters (as opposed to Timothy "prime time" McViegh), has not had an appeal yet. 
<p>I personally, would love to watch the current Supreme Court try this one on for size.   Would they act like they say republicans are supposed to act and leave one of the most sacred personal liberties the fuck alone?  Or would they act like American Republicans almost always DO act, and stick their noses in for "morality's sake." (After all… think of the children.)
<p>I'd love to get E-mail opinions about this one.  Last year I put my dog down.  You may not like the comparison, but I have yet to meet a human as deserving of love as that dog was.  He was dying, and in pain.  Two shots. One made him sleep, the second stopped his heart.  I held his paw.  Hardest thing I've ever done in my entire life.  I made my choice, I'd do it again. Think I was wrong?  Let me know.  (Send to Alyxz@aol.com<mailto:Alyxz@aol.com>, be sure to mention 'Brief aside" in the title so it doesn't get deleted with the spam.  Please, all kidding aside, just honest opinions.)
<p>***
<p>Wow! That was shitty of me.  Sorry to subject you to such a downer...will make it up to you:
<p>Two guys go on a five day hiking trip in the mountains.  On the third night, as they are beginning to get on each others nerves, one guy says to the other "Hey, how about tomorrow I go North, and you go South, and we'll meet back here tomorrow night to tell each other what we saw?"
<p>The second hiker agrees and in the morning, they go their separate directions.
<p>That night, when asked about his day, the first hiker responds "I found a valley with a crystal clear mountain lake, and a pure waterfall.  There were wild flowers along the banks, with butter flies in them, and I swam all day while majestic eagles soared overhead. It was the perfect day."
<p>The second hiker responded "Yeah.  Well...I went South and found railroad tracks.  And there was this beautiful woman tied to them, so I untied her and carried her gently away and we made love in every way imaginable until I couldn't take it anymore.  Then I came back here."
<p>The first hiker said "Wow!  Your day was even better than mine!  Did you get a blow job too?"
<p>The second hiker said "Naw.  I couldn't find her head."
<p>I might have to delete that aside from the AOL version. 
<p>(Editor's note from the Bird: No shit, Sherlock. Ew.)
<p>***
<p>Here's irony.  I have 3 computers at my disposal, ranging from 200 mhz laptop, to a 833 mhz (or something like that... who knows?) badass machine at work.  All of which have games.  The one at home has some of the most outstanding, and complex video games I've ever even seen, let alone played.
<p>Which game do I play the most?
<p>The Atari-esk "snake" game on my cell phone.
<p>Damn good game too.
<p>***
<p>I actually had more to write about, but I'm bored with this.  Maybe I will try to come out with a second one this week.  Write me about the Dr. Death thing, or any of my other crap if you feel inclined.  Maybe I'll answer, probably not.  But I will read it.
