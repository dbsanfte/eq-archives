<p>Email #7: I call 1 888 STATION, asking to speak to someone in the legal arena. Instead, I get the address for Tom Terrazas, who apparently works in Customer Service. I forwarded him a copy of my entire chain of correspondence with Michelle. As you can see, I made a few vague threats, mostly because I was running out of patience.</p>
<p>Dear Tom,</p>
<p>First, if there is any way to check the customer call in logs, please find out who helped me at 12:30 PST on today, September 5. The nice boy who answered was incredibly nice and helpful, but my cordless phone chose to commit suicide as I was trying to thank him. I didn't call back, given the horrendous call volume. My station name is XXXXX.</p>
<p>Second, I love the "hold" music. =)</p>
<p>I am looking forward to talking to you. I have high hopes that it will be a productive, civil
  meeting between two people who care about the game, albeit with different
  approaches.</p>
<p>As you may have feared, however, I have a problem. The following is an unadulterated email chain I had with Michelle Butler. What I need to know is:</p>
<p>1) What legal justification is there for my PLAYER account to be banned?</p>
<p>2) How will I be informed as to the decision?</p>
<p>3) When will I be contacted?</p>
<p>4) Who will I be able to speak with regarding a decision to ban my player account?</p>
<p>5) What is the position of Verant on my website and the information it contains? www.geocities.com/tweetyrant (I ask because I have gotten over 15,000 hits in less than a week, and I don't want to publish misinformation or incur legal disputes.)</p>
<p>As you will know from the chain, I am not disputing the cancellation of my guide account. While I feel I was an excellent guide, and I indeed have several emails testifying to this, I understand that I violated the rules. My PLAYER account is entirely different, according to the rules and regulations I cited in the final email (which will be the first that you read).</p>
<p>Could you please reply as soon as possible and let me know the answers to my questions? I appreciate your time, and I'm sorry to be taking up so much of it over what is truly a minor issue.</p>
<p> Sincerely,</p>

<p>Email #8, Tom's answer: Nope. Didn't bother.</p>
<p>Email #9: The newest: </p>

<p>Your EverQuest account XXXXX had been suspended and up for review for banning. After final deliberation, it was decided to ban your account</p>

<p>Email #10: My response:</p>
<p>Could you please explain why you were able to ban my account? I have not violated any Player Rules of Conduct as listed on the website, and according to the guide handbook, punishment for violating the guide restrictions is anything up to and including dismissal from the guide program.</p>
<p>I have received NO replies to various politely worded emails I have sent requesting further information. I have sent these emails to Michelle Butler and Tom Terrazas. I have also requested a discussion with a member of your legal team. The lack of response is confusing at best. Please respond.</p>
<p>   Sincerely,</p>
