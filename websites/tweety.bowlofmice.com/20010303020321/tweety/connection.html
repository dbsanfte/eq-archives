<p>Not a single guide shift goes by without at least one petition - "I went link dead and the (insert monster here) killed me, rez plz." The answer, as veterans of Verant customer service know, is no. This isn't because Verant is a tool of Satan designed to scourge us (there are totally DIFFERENT reasons behind Verant being a tool of Satan). The fact is, people go link dead for lots of reasons, most of them having nothing to do with Verant.</p>
<p>What happens when you go link dead? Well, the same state of the art monster AI that controls the aviaks, the frogloks, and the sarnaks takes you over. This is good if you're a monk. This is bad if you're a 22nd level wizard. Those mighty hand to hand skills might do eleven points of damage before you curl up and die like a roach in a Raid cocktail. God help you if you're a caster and your hands are full of spell books, dolls, or mugs of frosty cold beverage. (What is it the casters are drinking out of those steins? I always wanted to know.)</p>
<p>So anyway, the occasional link death gets filed under "act of god" and ignored, and rightfully so. However, our favorite overlords of gaming apparently follow the doctrine of policy by extrapolation. A policy that makes sense on a small level must be equally valid on bigger ones. ("This cigarette when smoked gives me a nice buzz, so it would really rock if I EAT A WHOLE BALE OF TOBACCO.")</p>
<p>Reports have been pouring out for months that the really high level raids, the ones that take 24 players all above 50th level, often go to shit faster than a white man in Mexico. Not because the players are incompetent, not because people don't have the resist gear, and not because of a lack of planning. The reason for failure? "You have been disconnected" flashing across the screen of the main assist, the primary cleric, and the enchanter all at once.</p>
<p>The barrage of information your lines are taking during a high level raid is extreme. Even though practically no player above 10th keeps all his chat filters open, that information is still being sent to your machine. Yes, all of it - the orc pawn missed you, someone on the other side of the zone cast a spell, you were burned by the damage shield, you swung and missed for the billionth time, and so on. Now, imagine being a 57th level rogue, next to a 59th level monk, who is in front of a 60th level warrior, who has a whole bunch more fighter types at his flank. All three of these dynamos are geared up with buffs, haste items and weapons with procs. Behind our mighty melees is a full array of casters, and they're casting buffs, heals, nukes, and dispels. Now turn on all your chat filters. And turn up your particle effects while you're at it.</p>
<p>THAT'S how much data is coming over your lines. You turning on filters isn't accomplishing dick except improving your machine's performance. Your modem is still being hammered worse than the cheapest whore near a naval base.</p>
<p>Yet, Verant is still standing around with all three arms busy. It has to be three, because they've got two hands over their ears screaming LA LA LA I CAN'T HEAR YOU and yet they still have a thumb in their collective ass. Lag is not their problem. Well, of course it's not! My bad! I must have missed the sticker that said "you must be a broadband customer to ride this ride." In fact, something bearing a startling resemblance to an Everquest game manual says "28.8 or faster connection required." That's the minimum standard. For what? A level four character who has yet to leave Freeport? But no, it can't be a design flaw. The fact that people on DSL or cable connections manage to stay connected, but ISDN and below get lagged out of any raid that requires a group larger than twelve, that must be irrelevant.</p>
<p>It sucks, you know. One of my roommates turned on particle effects for the heck of it the other day, and for the 45 seconds he stayed connected, it was the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen. Thing is, no one leaves on particle effects, because having the game be playable is more important to the people who… play it.</p>
