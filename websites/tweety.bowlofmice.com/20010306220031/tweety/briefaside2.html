<p>So there I am, in Nowhere, North Carolina, surrounded by drunk kids, mostly 
for the novelty of being able to drink with them now that I no longer teach 
at that puny college.  A decent buzz of my own going, more than enough to 
convince myself that not only am I twenty years old again, but I CAN still 
drink this much and not have a head ache at 8 am the next morning. 
<p>So I stand there, around the small island in the Kitchen, listening to 
some 19 year old sophomore telling a story.  God only knows what the fuck 
she's talking about.  I didn't much listen to these babes when I was 19, no 
reason to start now, but she's cute enough to serve as eye candy while most 
of my attention is on the bottle of Corona and trying to decide if the lemon 
in it really does alter the taste enough to be worth the effort.   
<p>There's some noise to the right of me...I've long since turned off my 
sense of hearing, a habit I picked up from being married to an actress, so I 
don't really hear it so much as just be aware of it.  Sort of like when my ex 
wife would tell me some boring ass story about her dance recital when she was 
five.  Turn off the hearing and leave some small part of your subconscious on 
the lookout for anything that sounded like a question so you'll know when to 
nod the 'affirmative' to whatever you'd been asked and go back to pondering 
the multiple angles any given remote control can point and still function. 
<p>Sparked by the unknown interest off to my left I notice a man, bandana 
over his face waving a gun around...he even fired a few shots into the 
ceiling. 
<p>I've been robbed a few times before.  I have just enough vices to land 
me into many shady places, but not enough to always get me out so the fact, 
while annoying, is not earth shattering.  What was interesting was that this 
bozo actually strolled into a house full of people, robbed them all, and 
left, all in a matter of seconds?   
<p>The whole thing was a real party killer (not to mention buzz kill), 
couldn't have cleared the place out faster if we'd announced Gerald Ford 
would be coming over for crackers and Tea.  Shame too because at that stage 
of drunkenness a dead man could've talked the shirts off of a few of those 
coeds, within the hour easily. 
<p>And they wonder why I'm jaded...what a world. 
<p>(Editors note: we at Brief asides would like to take this time to laugh at 
Alyxz, who seems to have a talent for letting the leeches of the world get 
the best of him.) 
<p>***
<p>In happier news: With all the buy outs, and sell outs that have been 
going in the old fashioned low tech gaming world, Margaret Weis and Tracy 
Hickman have been back to writing Dragonlance novels.  A new series by them 
just started called The War of Souls.  Will likely be a trilogy, since 
everything else in that series is...but who knows.  Book one "Dragons of a 
Fallen Sun" is out.  Decent reading. 
<P>It's a shame that Larry Elmore didn't do the cover.  The art is 
excellent, but there's always been something special about Elmer's 
Dragonlance stuff. 
<p>Margaret Weis also has a side series, with Don Periit, called the 
Raistlin chronicles.  Since half the people reading this probably have at 
least one screen name that's a Raistlin variant, this one is probably worth 
reading.  Book one and two are out.  Probably be another thirty years or so 
before book three, but they're kinda stand alonish. 
<p>Sorta. 
<p>***
<p>The Everquest toys still suck. 
<p>***
<p>Here's something that deserves mention: Junkyard Wars! 
<p>If you haven't had the pleasure of this show, you are definitely 
missing out.  Here's a show where every week, two teams of guys (or girls), 
four to a team, gather at a junkyard.  The judges inform them what they will 
be building, and the teams must compete. 
<p>The last episode consisted of the two teams being informed that they 
had eight hours, each, to build a hovercraft using things they found in the 
Junkyard.  At the end, the hovercraft (hovercrafts) would be pitted against 
one another in a race. 
<p>Quality entertainment there.  Add some cheerleaders and this show 
could have it all.  Maybe when some network buys it out they'll do that.  Of 
course they'll have to ruin it by adding commentary by Andy Dick or some 
other lame ass whose opinion we don't give a shit about, but we'll still 
watch it. 
<p>It's gotta be better than watching Grandma Moron decide whether or not 
to use a lifeline to find out which of the four fruit choices offered by 
Regis is orange. 
<p>*** 
<p>The world does seem to be relaxing a bit.  I remember when I was a 
teenager, everyone freaking out over Dungeons and Dragons, and how they 
were certain I was doomed to die before I hit 18 because of the fact that I 
played it. 
<p>Hearing that did wonderful things to my young psyche, that have been 
fun, on many drunken nights, to try to explore in the years to come. 
<p>Now I read about some guy starving his baby to death over Everquest.   
<p>(Tweety here - please do not send me mail. I am fully aware of the case, and that EQ had squat to do with the death of the baby. Alyxz is also fully aware of this. He's making a point.)
<p>No parades.  No protests.  No angry mobs standing at Comp USA 
demanding that they cease to sell the devils toy before we're all doomed to 
spend eternity locked in Satins closet with no food, in payment for our 
unspeakable video game monstrosity. 
<p>Are these people really calming down that much?  One possible theory 
is that all the former members of these groups are too busy scouting Bay for 
a new color lap top that will match the kitchen table cloth.  Another 
possibility is that, they're too busy trying to look shocked that Jesse 
Jackson has an illegitimate child...as if you could even hope to get into 
public office without at least four illegitimate children and two drug 
convictions. 
<p>For whatever reason, the protests and scandals aren't nearly as 
prolific as they once were.  Personally, I'm a bit disappointed.  I miss the 
old debates.  It gave us something to talk about. 
 <p>Now about the only debate you get is whether or not Al Gore is better 
than George Bush...a debate that holds all the excitement and thrill of 
"Should I put my coat on the coucher the chair?" 
<p>Wherever you are, Madmothers, evangelical wannabes, saviors of all 
that's not hurting you....please come back.  Our world is boring without you. 
<p>***
<p>Bell bottoms do not make your ass look good.  They make your ass look 
huge, like it's trying to bust out of the pants that are too big for you 
everywhere else.  Some people like Big asses.  Some don't.  Be aware of your 
reality. 
<p>***
<p>I have to say it, just once.  Writing for Tweety's site made me think 
of it. 
<p>Sometimes... 
<p>....Sometimes I just wish they'd let 'Mr. Puddy-Tat'  eat that fucking bird 
and be done with it. 
<p>Same with the coyote.   
<p>All in all, I have to say I prefer Itchy and Scratchy, if only for the 
cosmic justice it upholds. 
<p>(Editors note:  They fight.  They fight.  Fight fight fight, fight fight 
fight....)
<p>***
<p>Ever been to a fencing match?  Lame. 
<p>(Tweety here: Insert squawk of righteous indignation here!)
<p>This would be one of the best sports in the world if they ran it like 
the WWF.  As it is you don't even get to see it in the Olympics without 
satellite.  Of course… that's not saying much.  Most of us didn't get to see 
anything but running, diving, and gymnastics.  Not that I minded the 
gymnastics, but there are some spooky looking women on the swimming teams.   
<p>WFF, World Fencing Federation, could consist of various over the top 
personalities, clad in fencing gear decorated with everything from horns on 
the helmets, to actually lighting the chest guard on fire during the match, 
all the while showing off supremely bad acting skills by shouting "You're 
goin' Down man! You're goin' DOOOOWWWNNNN!" 
<p>Sadly..I'd probably watch every day. 
<p>*** 
<p>You made it to the end.  Is it everything you hoped? 
<p>(Insert mind numbingly gratuitous sex scene to please the masses)
