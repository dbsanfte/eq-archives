<p>I'm going to sound like one of those annoying high level players everyone hates here, but I can remember when people used to apologize for being twinked out, because it was something of a shame to be wearing stuff you could in no way get for yourself. As my play server aged, I started seeing twinked out people who didn't apologize for their outfits, because in a way they had earned the gear - their high level fighter earned it for their low level wizard, etc.</p>
<p>There's actually many benefits to an old server like this. Let's say your group of level 27-30 avatars dies horribly in Lower Guk. In the old days, it just sucked to be you. Your monks would start hauling corpses to the zone line, and if you got REALLY lucky you could pool your cash and buy exp rezzes from one of the few clerics who could rezz. Now, however, two of your group members vanish, and tell you to hang on a second. The 28 bard reappears as a 53 druid, and goes to fetch the 29 necro, now relogged as the 51 cleric. They reappear in the dungeon, rezz the party, buff them to hell, and then reappear as their smaller selves.</p>
<p>There's an even better side effect for the true newbies. These players rarely bother looting. Why bother with the 2 plat frog when they can solo a 40 plat giant? True newbies can clean up in terms of loot and cash when grouped with secondaries.</p>
<p>I think the best effect is the comedy, however. Say a primarily melee player is in West Commons, and wants to fight in Guk with his best friend, whose primary is a porter, but playing a melee for a secondary. The first guy logs in his secondary, a porter, and goes to fetch his friend. They land in West Commons, and he camps out the porter. When he logs the fighter back in, the friend is emoting bonks, stares, and glares all over the place. 'Why didn't you just take me to South Ro?" The melee thinks, "You pussy, West Commons is practically next to South Ro, it's not like I'm asking you to walk to Qeynos." The porter thinks, "For chrissake, who wants to walk everywhere?"</p>
<p>Or how about the wizard who, at level ten, is flinging himself into battle, auto attack blazing? The shaman who thinks, "Well, damn, I'm nearly out of mana, I better add my melee damage to the score to end the fight sooner," and ignored the screams to sit and med through the fight? The cleric who only tosses heals when the battle is over, because he's spending the fight stabbing at the monster with whatever little freaking joke weapon he's holding meanwhile I'm getting my ass beat here, would you please sit the fuck down and get some mana back so I don't die and have to walk from fucking Freeport goddam this class sucks why can't I bind in this zone… oh, sorry, got sidetracked there. The warrior who keeps forgetting to change his bind point when he changes continents? The monk who goes ahead and brings massive overpulls to the group instead of splitting them off? "Hey, guys, there's only three here, just mezz two of them and toss me a Cheal when I get there, k? What?? You guys don't have those spells yet? When the hell do you - URK! Ow! Mommy!"</p>
<p>It's just a different mindset in style, and it sometimes takes a few weeks to adjust. Try not to hate the kamikaze cleric - maybe he was a troll warrior in another life.</p>
