<p class="update">WEEKLY UPDATE - 7/04/01</p>
<p>I'm writing this as my ponytail drips dry. Me, a couple old college friends, and Lum decided to go see the famous Washington DC fireworks tonight. ("Hey, you guys read Lum the Mad? I got Lum in my bathroom!" "Aargh.") Scattered showers were on the menu, and sure enough, upon our arrival in our nation's capital, there was a brief spattering of rain and it ended. We went in search of food, and discovered that a helping of BBQ was seven dollars. People watching commenced, and we mocked people in umbrella hats. We saw a sign reading "JESUS." ("You think that's him?" "No, he's probably for sale for seven dollars.") We left the nice dry tent we'd been hiding under and headed up to the Washington Phallic Symbol - at which point we sat and watched as animals walked past us in pairs. The women were all in favor of waiting it out, but after a half an hour of a torrential downpour, the men voted to head for the train. We did, and discovered how nice and friendly cops are when they feel threatened by large crowds. ("I'm going to go tell that cop that he's not helping the situation when he's rude." "No, you're not. He doesn't have to be nice, he has a gun.")</p>
<p>When I got to the station near my house, I heard boom boom noises. I looked out over the parking lot, and there, slightly obscured by clouds and thunderheads, were the glorious DC fireworks. The moral of this story is LISTEN TO THE WOMEN IN YOUR GROUP, YOU IMPATIENT BASTARDS.</p>
<p>Sorry the updates are so sporadic. If I leave my house at 7:00 AM, and take the train, I can be to the office by nine. If I leave at 7:00, and ride in with a friend, I get there by 7:45. This is not my favorite hour of the day. Even starting so godawful early, I still don't get home until 9:00 PM on occasion, which doesn't leave a lot of time for writing. And a number of the things that spring to mind at the end of such a day are not always printable. But I got one today I just can't resist. Enjoy.</p>
<p>Remember, you're always free to email me with questions and comments.</p>
