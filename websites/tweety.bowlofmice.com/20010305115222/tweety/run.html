<p>This is my character. I can make his face look like I want, and I can name him, and I can choose his stats. This is fun! See Xribinlendarxis run. Run, Xribinlendarxis, run!</p>
<p>This is my rat. I will slay the rat and rip off his whiskers. This is fun! See my rat run. Run, rat, run!</p>
<p>This is my quest. I'm helping this man who can't find his daughter. The story is, she got lost in the sewer, and a shark ate her. This is so cool. I wonder how many things like this there are in the game? There's so much to do! There's the shark now, run, shark, run!</p>
<p>This is my partner, Corandialisteria. She is a healer, and I am a fighter. We can kill more stuff if we work together. This is going to sound funny, but I really feel like I know her, you know? We're getting to be real friends, not just in the game. We try to meet every night, because we make such a great team. Run, team, run!</p>
<p>This is my group. We are fighting together. We are just learning what the other classes can do, so we die a lot, but it doesn't matter. I reappear one zone away, so I can get back to my group really fast. We are beating the orcs. This is fun! Run, orc, run!</p>
<p>This is my room in a dungeon. My group fights all the things that spawn here. It's a long walk if we die, but we're better at fighting now, so we don't die very often. Our group just got the L33T SWORD OF ASS KICKING! We decided the warrior needs it the most, and we gave it to him. He's pretty happy. Run, warrior, run!</p>
<p>This is my camp in the dungeon. We can't seem to find an enchanter, or a bard, or anyone with crowd control, so we're kind of on edge at the moment and getting a little touchy and temperamental, but we're camping for the UBER L33T MACE OF INYOFACE and the thing who drops it only pops every two hours, so we gotta hang on for a little longer. Hey! One dropped! Um… the warrior wants it, and he's been here for six hours, but the cleric has been here for eleven hours and he really wants it for his warrior twink, but I'm pretty sure he's going to sell it. Dammit, what do I do now? Everyone wants it, and it takes forever to get one, "be patient" is NOT going to go over well…wtf is a train, and why does the guy in the next room keep yelling it? WHERE THE HELL DID ALL THOSE FROGS COME FROM! Run, Xribinlendarxis, run!</p>
<p>This is my part of the dungeon, and I fucking own it! Man, we've been pulling the named Bigcritterofboxershortscream all NIGHT and it's running like clockwork. We are one well-oiled MACHINE, I tell you, and we're managing to pull all the shit from three rooms around. It fucking hurts to be this good! Sure, it took four hours for the break in, and we had a nasty CR, but we regrouped and we made it! Pulling the whole area is what makes it worthwhile, you know? I died three times getting here, but the way we're pulling I'm going to make that exp back AND make a healthy profit selling the phat lewt we have dropping on us like a fucking hailstorm. We rule! Hey - what the fuck? That d00d from The Shining Knights of Nutlicking just took one of my pops! Who the fuck he thinks he is, coming in here and farming my goddam repops? This area is mine, motherfucker! Get out or I'll train your ass out! Run, biotch, run!</p>
<p>This is my plane. First of all, cocksucker, your little no name bunch of roleplaying L00ZERS couldn't hack it up here without my skillz, so don't even think about raiding up here. Check the board, you little pussy, and grovel nicely, and MAYBE I'll let you up here to slurp up my sloppy seconds. If you wanted to play in my plane, you should have bought the game when I did on release and play 24/7. You snooze, you lose, asshole. My group, I mean my guild, earned the right to be here, and while I was WORKING on my shit, you were what? Doing quests? Making friends? Exploring? What a gimp. What did you think this was, a game? Get the fuck out of here, or no one who's anyone on this server will cyber you with someone else's keyboard. Run, loser, run.</p>
<p>This is my zone. I swear to fucking god, if that stupid Cyclops doesn't show up and drop a ring I'm going to go postal. I am the only one in the entire game who doesn't have jboots, and everyone knows you can't play the game without jboots. There's just no way in hell. I gotta have them, and I deserve them. I don't see why I can't just slaughter that little fucking Yoda clone and grab his pair. What the hell were the designers thinking, putting in quests? You'd think this game was about quests or some such shit. Dammit, none of this shit in this zone has been experience for about fifty levels now. I've been camped here for three solid days, I haven't eaten anything except Hot Pockets and pizza, and I smell funny. I just want the ring, please gimme the ring, I can't deal with this anymore, just fucking POP YOU STUPID CYCLOPS!!! Holy shit, it did. It popped. Oh, my god, in five minutes I can go take a shower and empty the ashtray, I just need to kill it and loot the ring. Wha… it's dead? Who the fuck is looting it? Corandialisteria?!? You fucking whore! I said I was camping the zone, you stupid twat! It's MINE! I said IT WAS MINE, are you deaf, you pusholed bitch! I knew you at level three, wtf happened to you? What? I said you were a twat, and I'll say it again. TWAT TWAT TWAT. What? YOU'RE A MAN???? AAAAAAAAAAAARGHHHHHHHHHHH….</p>
<p>Run, EQ players, run.</p>
