<p class="update">WEEKLY UPDATE - 9/20/01</p>
<p>I just watched Bush's speech. Looks like we're going to war - if you're at all familiar with the Taliban, you'll realize there is no way they will meet tonight's demands.</p>
<p>I am not a fan of the president, or Bush Lite as I'm fond of saying. But two things came to mind tonight - one, his speechwriter does not get paid enough. That person deserves to have their salary doubled. And two, there was probably no better man to give the speech than Bush. He looks so small, his face is so normal, maybe even a little weak. He doesn't thunder, or roar, or evoke the larger than life heroes of wars past. He sounded tonight like someone who is scared, and yet like someone who is going to live with the fear and do the best he can. In short, he is us. An ordinary American.</p>
<p>I would ask of you all to do two things. First, I'd like it if you would all make a point of going to a restaurant or a business run by a person from the Middle East. I would like you to patronize their establishment, and call them neighbor. They need you.</p>
<p>And second, I would like to call for the reestablishment of an old American tradition - the service flag. Beginning in World War I, families used to hang a flag in their windows, with a blue star for every relative who was active in the armed services. It would be replaced with a gold star in the event of his death. In later conflicts, the definition was expanded from family to any loved one or colleague. Service flags fell out of fashion after World War II. Maybe something like that shouldn't be subject to the whims of fashion.</p>
<p>I know I sound like a broken record when it comes to appreciating our people in uniform. Deal. In the last week, the worst part of the whole mess was wanting to DO something, to help in some way. Candlelight vigils are all well and good, and you can pray until your face turns blue, but after you've given your blood and your money, I feel like you've got nothing left to give but your support. You don't have to support war to support our people in uniforms.</p>
<p>No new rant. New Brief Aside though, so check it out.</p>
<p>Remember, you're always free to email me with questions and comments.</p>
