<p>When you compare the logic behind the gaming choices in EQ to, oh, well, ANYTHING in Dungeons and Dragons, Zork, etc., you start to wonder if the weed Verant hands out at staff meetings is straight dope or laced with stupid pills. Verant reinvented the wheel of RPGs, but they forgot to include anything like axles, cotter pins, hubs, and in some cases, spokes.</p>
<p>After getting a letter from Pope Dave of Infocom fame, which regular readers will remember me drooling about in an update a couple days ago, I was inspired to try and track down the old games. (Well, what I really wanted were the cool toys that came with every game, but the games themselves would have sufficed.) The internet being what it is, I got completely sidetracked, and ended up spending a good hour reading <a href="http://www.csd.uwo.ca/Infocom/Articles/"><span class="greenLink">articles</span></a> ABOUT Infocom and the people behind the company. (Dear Holy One - Bet you never thought these words of yours were going to resurface to haunt you again…) The Pope wrote in DECEMBER 1980:</p>
<p class="yellow">"The mention of falling into a lake brings up another possible extension to Zork. Currently players aren't allowed to swim. One reason was to avoid the problems associated with the player's belongings dragging him under. Another is the question of what happens to his belongings. Do they get wet? If so, do they ever dry out again? What about wet matches (to give one example)? Is wet paper still burnable? How long can the player swim? Can he hold his breath and swim underwater? There are any number of questions that have to be considered if such a feature is to be implemented. </p>
<p class="yellow">"Even the addition of a run-of-the-mill object can produce complications. In early versions of Zork, the troll's axe disappeared when he was killed. We finally decided to let the player recover it, as advances in Zork weapons technology removed the reason for destroying it. Unfortunately, we didn't think it through. One of our best play testers, on hearing that "you can finally get the axe," immediately said, "Great, I'm going to go up to the forest and chop down some trees." Oops. We never thought of that, not to mention using the axe to chop through doors, split timbers, and any number of other commonplace uses for something we were thinking of strictly as a weapon."</p>
<p>Now compare this logic (familiar to anyone who ever played DND with a DM who wasn't high on weed, Dr. Pepper, and/or pizza) with EQ.</p>
<p>HAHAHAHAHAHA, that was a good laugh, wasn't it? I could overlook the swimming thing, because Kedge Keep is absolutely the most amazing zone in the game, IMHO. And, giving the devil his due, they do have the whole stamina thing worked out pretty well. However, it seems that worrying about things like added weight from water, water soaked weapons, etc., would have been plain old Too Hard. Why? You use drinking water faster in the desert, so that wasn't too hard. What makes one complex mathematical computation more difficult than others?</p>
<p>Well, that's really just a nit, in what overall happens to be a top notch game environment. They do a kick ass job in so many ways, it almost hurts to be picky. So let's turn to something that I can be justifiably annoyed over.</p>
<p>If the Verant weasels had produced Zork:</p>
<p>They would have made the axe recoverable by the player.<br>
They would have learned in beta testing that players are clever critters who come up with unforeseen uses.<br>
They would have released the item anyway.<br>
They would have nerfed the axe six months later.
</p>
<p>It feels as though what we have here is a company that is strictly reactive in strategy. They release a new item or skill, and if it turns out to have a bigger impact than they planned, they nerf it. They know their ability to hunker in a bunker far outlasts their customers' ability to generate email. Riding out the Teapot Tempest of the Month is apparently more cost effective than doing things right the first time.</p>
<p>Creativity on the part of the customer is invariably crushed - which tells me that not only is logical thinking becoming a lost art, but the ability of a designer to be secure enough to say, gosh, I never thought of that, is fading into history along with moonwalking and jelly bracelets.</p>
<p>The best DM in the sixth grade made a point of considering how a magic ring might affect the overall campaign. Planning for possible repercussions was not this kid's JOB. He was eleven. He got confused by the sex ed video. (He got even more confused when I gave him the run down on the video the girls watched, but that's a little off topic.) There's gotta be someone at these companies whose JOB is to worry about the details.</p>
<p>My point here is that game companies have become far removed from the roots of RPGs. So far, in fact, that the implications of their actions and choices are simply not considered in any depth before implementation. Is there anything we can do as customers to make sure that all future games be more than some accountants "ship by" date? Is there any company out there who is making it their goal to avoid the endless rounds of nerfing and "oops, didn't mean THAT" oozing from updates?</p>
<p>It was understood in NINETEEN FUCKING EIGHTY that beta testing reveals all manner of things not anticipated by the designers. Would some beta testers of Everquest PLEASE post to the message board and tell me how you were told to communicate with the company? I fully expect to hear about Ouija boards and tins cans connected by long bits of string. Damn, I hope I'm wrong.</p>
