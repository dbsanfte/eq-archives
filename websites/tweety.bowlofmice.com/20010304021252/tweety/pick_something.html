<p>I never, ever was tempted to roll a druid. Sure, they're mobile little bastards, what with SoW and porting. Sure, they can kite their way to uberhood without blinking. Sure, they can evac from tough situations. Sure, they've got buffs, nukes, and fun personalities. High level druids face one major problem, however, that my beloved monk class will never face.</p>
<p>"Dude, will you twink me?"</p>
<p>Druids are the absolute best twinkers, bar none. They have chloroplast, thorn shield, healing, invis, port, and snare. If you have a druid by your side at level one, you can be level fifteen before you have to take a bathroom break. If you've played the game enough to know where the best exp is, a druid and three days of uninterrupted play time can get you to planable.</p>
<p>So, if you're a druid and you belong to a guild, chances are good that if your guildmates roll a new character, you're going to be targeted. You'll be happily darting about Norrath, singing tralala or whatever the hell it is druids do when they aren't kiting big fucking giants over the heads of hapless melee classes, and someone will sidle up to you like a flasher in a cheap coat, and ask for a little powerleveling.</p>
<p>Nothing wrong with this! Helping your friends is what the game's all about, except for camping, looting, being repeatedly killed… but I digress. It takes so little time to buff that lowbie into invincibility, that it's completely worth it. The sooner your guildmate is high level, the sooner you can all get to the fun stuff.</p>
<p>Unless they are… THE PERMA LOWBIE. I know you. You get to a certain point with your necro, and you realize that what you REALLY want to be is a monk. You get feign, discover you get lost too easily to be useful in dungeons, and so you switch to a troll shadowknight. Boy, that exp penalty is a bitch, maybe a halfling warrior would be more fun. Gee, everybody laughs at you, maybe an erudite wizard would be more respectful. Hey, nobody ever wants to come over to this completely deserted island, this sucks. How about a half elf warrior starting in Freeport, crossroads of the nation? Whoa, everyone thinks that's even funnier than the halfling. You try a dark elf cleric, and you find out you have PLEASE BEAT ME UP AND TAKE MY LUNCH MONEY stamped on your forehead. You create an ogre warrior, and you learn that Feerott completely blows monkey sperm for leveling. You can level from one to thirty without ever leaving Permafrost, so you try out a barbarian shaman, until you realize that the helpful newbie guards are six zillion miles away from where you're fighting.</p>
<p>Picking a class isn't that hard. Decide what's important to you, roll the character, commence whacking. I can't decide what makes me laugh more, people who change characters more than they change underwear, or people who scientifically analyze spreadsheets and parsers to figure out the class they should choose. Clue train making a whistle stop! The spreadsheets don't analyze "fun," dorks! You wanna swing a sword or blast things to hell? Efficient be damned! Have a good time, for crying out loud!</p>
<p>One player I know claims he switches characters because he likes to hear the little bell ring whenever he levels. Bell ring, dog drool. Other people switch because they are certain that somewhere there exists the perfect class/race combination that doesn't have any drawbacks. Oh, sure, what a good idea that would be for Verant to include - yo, dumbass! If that class existed, don't you think that after a year and a half of release, someone would have noticed that combo? Don't you think there would be a million of those Ultimate Combos racing around? Some people think they're actually helping their guild, because their guild has a shortage of left handed goat lovers or whatever class is trendy. Meanwhile, the guild starts thinking maybe they should put some limits on how much gear they give their perma lowbie, because after outfitting your eight characters, they're completely out of twink gear and you have yet to break thirty five.</p>
<p>Who is the real sufferer here? The druid, that's who. He has followed you through every single rats bats and spiderlings zone in Norrath. So, for the sake of druids everywhere, please do them a favor and get a character over 35, so they can sit and stare and put thorn shield on you in new, more exotic locations.</p>
