<p>Why do people whine about their class? If you wanted to be the main healer, don't be a fucking druid. If you want to be the main assist, don't be a paladin. If you don't know what main assist is, please, for the love of ass monkeys, stop playing the 55th level warrior and get the hell away from all the people who hate you which is the entire server by now. Really. I'm not kidding.</p>
<p>Aside from straight up common sense like that, what on earth is the point in starting a thread on Whineplay to announce how much your chosen class sucks? I'd like to bring your attention to the character selection screen. See all those slots? Fill one with another class if you hate yours so much. Doesn't whining for sixty straight levels annoy you? It's annoying everyone else. I've drawn the conclusion that your helmet blocks out the shrieks of dismay that are actually audible when you type in your Station ID.</p>
<p>But, I understand you. You're just sad. What I don't get are the people achieving warp factor twenty on the pathetic scale - the forty million OTHER (insert class here) who bumped the thread with their identical tales of woe. Helpful hint - if the first poster had a clear, reasonable argument with facts and statistics, please drink a glass of shut the fuck up and limit your comments to "hell yeah" or "right on." If someone on an IDSN connection can't download a single "I SUXXOR AND IT'S VERANT'S FAULT" thread in less time than it takes to fold her entire T-shirt collection, the thread is too fucking long.</p>
<p>I especially like the kids who pipe in say, a druid thread, and say essentially "You guys are so mean, how dare you imply that the classes are not perfectly balanced in every way? I hate you all, I wish you would die. Abashi, I miss you and want to have your children, even though I'm male maybe I could carry your sperm in my mouth and reproduce like those little South American frogs do, those are really cool. Bumpfuzzle!" And then they sign this mass of drivel with something like "Cuddlywabbit, the 45th enchanter of Prehensile Penis Twisters." Aside from my inherent objections to adolescent males wishing to reproduce by drinking Abashi protein shakes, the real question is this - why is an enchanter participating in the druid thread? No, no, the real question is did this Jerry's Kid just not NOTICE that Abashi has a new job now?</p>
<p>And that's just WHINEPLAY. They at least have certain rules, like be a customer before you start shooting off your big honking mouth. "Private" boards have no such rules. (Notice I said private in quotes, we all know you can get your sorry ass in a world of hurt for posting on some obscure message board no one can find without the sekrit password and the burnt offerings.) Thus you find people posting such gems as "I quit four months ago, and these are the things that suck about playing a ranger." GAH. Get a life. Play something. Watch TV. Fuck your hamster. ANYTHING.</p>
<p>I could live with these spunk riders, if they didn't one and all have this enormous sig file that rotates, blinks, plays MIDI "music," and offers you a free blow job with the purchase of any two massage therapies. It's a law of the bulletin board, the more obnoxious the poster, the longer it will take to download their tapdancing signature that plays a slide show of the last time they killed Venril Sathir. Your sig file is at best supposed to be a picture with a cute caption, maybe a couple fades. It's NOT supposed to be your entry at Cannes, goddammit. There's a good reason I have my own forum set with size limits for these monstrosities. It's my moron filter, if your sig file is too big to pass through, you can't play in my sandbox.</p>
<p>Maybe it's just me.</p>
