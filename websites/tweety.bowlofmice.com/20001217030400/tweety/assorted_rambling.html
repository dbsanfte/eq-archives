<p>It's safe to say people play games for the entertainment factor. For the sake of this rant, let's say that the reason people become obsessed with games because the game fulfills some sort of need. Respect, money, power, popularity, a sense of being one who matters - all these can be found in some sort of virtual world available for fifty bucks and a decent net connection. </p>
<p>You don't even need to be a gamer to get away from your less-than-perfect real life. Find a message board, an IRC channel, or a website, and begin establishing the better, smarter YOU. You can flirt, pontificate, argue, and even indulge in the odd form of masturbation known as cybersex. You can be anyone and anything. The comparison of the internet to the American Wild West is overdone (who are the Native Americans?), but there is a remarkable parallel between the internet/WWW and a crazed, anything-goes frontier culture.</p>
<p>Yet I have seen the future of the internet. The wild brothels and conclaves of fierce independence are already giving way to the straightlaced sensibilities of the middle classes. I fully expect the entire roiling cauldron of individuality to give way to planned thoroughfares marked by corporate hosts and "condominiums" with strict community standards like theglobe.com and geocities. Instead of the local site editor or board moderator administering a smackdown as he sees fit, there will be official rules of law invoked by professionals when one citizen is threatening to another. I happen to think this fucking sucks.</p>
<p>This is also where the Wild West parallel falls apart. See, the coming of "modern civilization" to the American Western frontier wasn't all bad for the (white) citizens. Plumbing, for one thing. Access to education and literature. More opportunities for those without any inclination to tame the wilds. Luxury and comfort. Do any of these things apply to the frontier of ideas and independent thinking that the internet represents? The answer is no. Those who do not care for the atmosphere engendered by the free flow of ideas (no matter what kind of idea) have an alternative that the sickly, artistic settlers longing for civilization never had - turn off the fucking computer. By dictating acceptable content, you rule out original ideas that ordinarily would never become known.</p>
<p>Enough set up, I'll try and get to the point, and to keep it simple I'll step back from the internet as a whole and keep to gaming communities. There has been a rumbling in our little subculture for quite a while now regarding safety. Not physical safety, necessarily, although plenty of people foolish enough to release identifying information in their "bios" have learned that a serious loony can follow you from a virtual world to your "real" world. I'm talking about the feeling of security one has when one is loved and surrounded by like-thinking admirers. The basic premise of the rumblers is that "we have a right to feel safe (read: free to say what we want without having to listen to anyone else) online."</p>
<p>That is complete and unadulterated bullshit. You have no such right. By stepping up and creating a persona, you have agreed to participate in a virtual world. Your participation means that you will interact with other people. And THAT means, my little mentally challenged amigo, that sometimes people will not like you. Those people might assume, from your lack of ability to communicate in this type of forum, that you're a moron who should be sterilized for the sake of humanity. You might get your feelings hurt. How do you cope with the slings and arrows of your daily life? "But that's DIFFERENT! I log on to get AWAY from all that!" No, pal, it's not different at all. The only real difference between life and online is that you're judged by how well you express yourself instead of how well you fill out your jeans.</p>
<p>The only exception to my position lies in situations where the one being attacked is unable to protect themselves. I don't mean people who are too pathetic to defend themselves in a war of words and ideas. If all you can do is knit, get off the battlefield. What I mean by exceptions is when an avatar is being followed by a pack of other players who think it's funny when he/she gets upset. This person cannot be reasonably expected to solve the problem. This is where the rest of the community steps in, and enforces some community standards. The solution is NOT to impose a solution from the outside, a solution coming from the minds of people who are not and never will be members of our particular community.</p>
<p>I guess what I'm really asking is that the knitters quit crying when they get hit with a sword, because all the squealing is making it tough to figure out when someone really needs the posse to come in with their guns ablazing.</p>
