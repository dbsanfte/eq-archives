<p>In every battle fought by ground troops, the line has a rallying point. This point is generally a structure with some sort of emotional significance to the contenders, or a geographical point. People are generally not willing to risk themselves if they don't have a clear goal in mind. In the absence of a hill, a fort, or a border, good leaders provide something else for the troops to fight for - a battle flag, or themselves. In a war of ideas, with no land to be taken or defended, the significance of a battle flag or a figurehead is even more important. People are less willing to open their minds to attack than their bodies, because it feels as though to attack what someone believes is to attack who they are as a person. Without a rallying point, the war loses coherence rapidly, degenerating into small insular conclaves that flare up and out with no real damage.</p>
<p>The battle so recently fought over Mystere's banning is a perfect example. Hundreds of people were outraged by what they perceived as a blatant violation of an author's rights. Using Mystere as a rallying point, petitions were organized, letter writing campaigns begun, and the full power of the internet was unleashed. When Mystere stepped forth and said I'm not your martyr, the battle ceased.</p>
<p>I'm not criticizing him for refusing to take the part of the battle flag. The man publicly stated that he had a family to provide and care for. Being our martyr would have meant standing at the front lines, being judged by a story not truly representative of his writing. While those of us screaming for justice vastly outnumbered the VAKs and the small minded who cheered his banning, the fact is that there were people who thought he was sick and dirty. </p>
<p>I know of a family, who has a son. He had several mental illnesses that caused him to be paranoid, and he often told stories about his life at home that had no basis in fact. Despite the fact that his older sibling had no such problems, and described parental discipline as "normal," teachers still believed the boy when he said he was abused at home. Despite the fact that this child was identified as mentally unstable, despite his track record for lying and paranoia, one "responsible" adult called Child Protective Services. On the basis of this ONE complaint, the boy was removed from his home, his parents' EMPLOYERS were notified, and the case went to court. In the process, the boy's parents met many other parents caught up in the same web. More than fifteen years later, the boy's father still has to take lie detector tests, still has to submit to psychological evaluations every year, just to keep his security clearance and his job. </p>
<p>If Mystere had agreed to be our rallying point, what might have happened? I was one of the people urging for the mainstream media to be contacted. Let's say CNN tracked Mystere down. He would have stood there and told his story on national television. Newspapers would have picked it up, and while they wouldn't have posted the "bad" story, they would have printed URLs enabling readers to find it. Let's say his next door neighbor read the story, and like Verant, assumed that dark thoughts inevitably mean dark actions. What if this neighbor called Child Protective Services? Mystere could have lost his children or his job. This is not wild exaggeration. This possible outcome is something I have seen happen.</p>
<p>So, it seems clear that Mystere's best interests did not include being our martyr, and I will not fault someone for choosing his five children over a video game. </p>
<p>The battle was over Mystere - the war is about something else entirely. I should say "things:" Intellectual property, and whether or not customers contribute to the value of that property. Free speech (because although that term as used in the U.S. Constitution means that the government cannot abridge your rights to speak, the fact of the matter is that Americans have come to assume they have the right to state an opinion or idea so long as none are injured by it - and that has legal value. See the Supreme Court and the recent Miranda decision). Consumer rights. Our love for a game that is run by people with no love for us.</p>
<p>The war of ideas is not over, but it will remain dormant until we have a hill to take, a flag to carry, a fortress to storm. Or a martyr to bleed for us.</p>
