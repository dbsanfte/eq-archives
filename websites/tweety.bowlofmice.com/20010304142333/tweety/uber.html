<p>Whatever happened to UBER YOU? This was a cute little web business that promised, for a fee, to hook you up with big guilds for plane runs and dragon raids. And you were GUARENTEED some uber loot. It was a brilliant concept, albeit somewhat disturbing.</p>
<p>I had no problems with the business itself - hey, you see a need, you fill it. It's the American Way, dammit. The guilds on one end of the equation? Had my guildleader been approached, I feel secure in the assumption that he would have a) pissed himself laughing, b) changed his pants because who wants to sit around with a damp ass, c) said, sure, we'll take someone to Hate or Fear with us, as long as he holds still and doesn't talk or ag anything, and d) taken the money for himself and bought some lapdances in Vegas when the guild has their semi-annual reunion.</p>
<p>The people willing to pay money to go on a raid, and essentially admit they had leveled a character up without making or keeping any friends… um, I dunno. I'm not getting into the uber vs. non-uber debate today. I know both sides of the argument - Uber Players are all selfish assholes, Normal Players have written cookbooks on 101 Things To Do With Sour Grapes, blah blah blah. Whatever. Who cares. There's easily three thousand threads on the subject.</p>
<p>Thing is, "uber" often gets defined as "what gear am I wearing." Ebay would not have gotten so popular if it hadn't been for the perception of gear being so crucial. If you feel like you can't play the game without certain pieces of gear, a mentality of "by whatever means necessary" is going to kick in. If you can't get the Breastplate of Super Hooters on your own, and you need it to go to the Plane of Shiny Things, eventually you're going to justify any behavior you adopt in order to get it. Any behavior, including being an asshole, a farmer, or an Ebay Soldier. Or you suck up to GMs….</p>
<p>This gear fixation is the biggest problem in EQ, because it's the one from which most of the other problems spring (problems, that is, that are not related to people just being fucking stupid). Camping, loot whoring, spawn hogging, thirty six hours waiting for the Ancient Cyclops to spawn… all of these things would simply cease to be an issue if X item dropped throughout a certain area. I can see some items being dropped only by certain mobs - like a froglok crown, that really should drop off a king. But the rest could be randomized without doing any harm to the… wait for it… roleplaying. Oh, god, I kill me. I'm so funny when I talk about roleplaying in EQ.</p>
<p>But, hey, it's not going to get fixed. Every new expansion comes out with the same basic flaw, and why is that? Could it be because there are practically no people at Verant who play their own game, untwinked? What does the pain and agony of getting gear matter when you can waltz around wearing guide-caliber equipment without having to claw your miserable way through a forty hour camp? Rumors are flying, and my email box is full about this character on Terris with the most amazing gear - despite not belonging to a guild (or even having friends in any sizable guild) capable of helping him get it. Everyone "knows" this guy must either be a Verant employee or a special friend thereof. Every GM I ever knew (okay, only five of them) told me about Verant employees saying, "Hey, do this for my character Asswhooper, will you?"</p>
<p>Two things about this - one, you don't have to like it, but the fact is the world operates by "it's who you know." You can either spend your life resenting it, or you can move on. The other thing to think about is maybe it's not the gear that makes you "uber." This guy, whoever he is, walks around wearing gear you normally have to guide to wear, and yet not one soul thinks of him as uber-anything, except maybe an ass-kissing loser.</p>
<p>I feel sorry for this person. He's so pathetic that he can't earn his own gear, and can't survive in a video game he may have created without special help. Is his machine set for the handicapped options too? Is the shuttle bus for employees short and yellow?</p>
<p>Does this one idiot getting special favors make him more uber than you?</p>
