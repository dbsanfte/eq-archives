<p>Ah, Whineplay, where the term VAK was coined, where simple relentless whining single celled organisms grew into mighty trolls. Where on a bad day the average reader just came away feeling dirty. Where on a good day you might see a Verant employee posting after knocking back a few beers. Where the "I am your average customer" <a href="/tweety/does_whineplay_make_you_stupid.html">thread</a> grew to 80+ posts before someone at Verant put down the bong and deleted it. Where the mere mention of people who <a href="/tweety/this_time_im_really.html">roleplay dark elves</a> drew instant reactions. Where a hundred people posting about a bug might get some notice assuming it was between two and three AM on the night of a full moon and entrails had been scattered appropriately, but one player cussing drew a ban. It was draconian, it was ridiculous, and it was filled with people whom I prayed would never breed.</p>
<p>Verant being their usual "kill the mosquito with a nuclear missile" selves, wiped out Whineplay with one blow. Public reaction was along the same lines as the people who say one solid nuke to Washington DC would solve the nation's problems. Sure, it's funny to SAY, but you don't really mean it, and if it did happen you'd cry over the damage to the monuments and suburban shopping centers. So even though the scattering of the Whiners is widely held to be for the best, the drawbacks to total annihilation are becoming apparent.</p>
<p>For one thing, remember my mushroom analogy? Crushing a mushroom doesn't really do anything except scatter spores. While stomping on the Whineplay regulars had to have been loads of fun, little bits of fungus are even now spreading out to all the good message boards. The knee jerk VAKs might have some problems, as the dark fecal filled corners of Whineplay was the most nurturing environment for their particular species of toadstool. But think about the creeping mildew that is My Class Is Broken - they can survive in the most hostile environments. Or the deadly nightshade of the I'm Quitting EQ Forever And You Suck If You Don't - is there any board immune from this type? The Jock Itch Of Listen To Me Now Dammit Because My Mom Wouldn't Breastfeed Me has already taken root on several boards I belong to. By taking away Whineplay, Verant burst a dam and now everyone's basement is flooded.</p>
<p>But let's just say for the moment that the sanctity of our player-run communities don't matter a furry rat's ass. Hell, certain people at Verant say it every damn day, I might as well. What about the feedback aspect of Whineplay? The tremendous amount of public pressure that had to be mounted to get the slightest message through was obscene. We all know /feedback doesn't work. We know /bug doesn't work. We know Ester "I hate doing tedious things" the Tester likes to tell us things are working as intended unless someone sits on her goddam desk and forces her to look at it. We know that the powers that be have been trained BY WHINEPLAY to ignore a single person's complaint as statistically insignificant. So how exactly is this new process going to work? Is someone going to keep a tally of how many complaints on a subject get sent in?</p>
<p>As a guide, I never knew if the quests and skills I reported as broken were intentionally disabled or true bugs, since that sort of Secret Information isn't granted unless you're an employee. (You in the back - you don't think some things are intentionally broken? Christ, I'll bet you're the monkey fucker who petitioned me every night for a month to ask when the Tumpy Tonic dude was going to be fixed.) Is that information going to be made public so we'll know if particular issues are on their radar?</p>
<p>The volume of Whineplay was such that two or three people with NOTHING ELSE TO DO couldn't keep up - and now the process is being taken to email? I don't think the trained ferrets that run the server farm are going to be able to handle it. Sorry if I sound suspicious here. Really. Just because a quadrapeligic hamster has a better track record, just because Saddam Hussein has been better at keeping promises, just because Washington lobbyists are more trustworthy, these are no reasons for me to think that the chances of the new Customer Input process being honest are going to be worth less than those of a tissue paper cat being chased by an asbestos dog through hell. I mean, come on! Verant loves their customers! With mustard!</p>
<p>I just don't get it. Reports have been rolling in that the last patch was a true joy. People on regular modems are suddenly able to join their friends on raids, previously vague things like loot sizes are clear, and people who never before saw a waterfall or a monk's bubbles feel like they did when they first started the game. Was someone at Verant afraid they were going to get a good reputation? Did the idea of being customer friendly and responsive to input cause physical pain?</p>
<p>Tell me, did the idea that customers would appreciate server side filtering come from Whineplay, or someone at Verant slogging through sixty untwinked levels and a pickup raid in Chardok?</p>
