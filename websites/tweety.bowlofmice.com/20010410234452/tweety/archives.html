<p>Due to my thinking that no one would care about the inaccurately named "Weekly Updates" until I got email to the contrary, stuff older than 10/17 is lost forever. Since we're talking about a month and a half's worth of
   stuff, this is no great loss.</p>
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE 4/3/01</p>
<p>Man, the Everquest April Fool's joke was pretty good. (For those of you who do not compulsively read websites, the gag appeared to be the removal of /anon and /roleplay from the game "to make it easier for players to locate clerics, druids, and wizards." That was the nerf; the improvement was going to be a little plus or minus sign indicating your willingness to help strangers. The little sign NOT being visible when one typed /who all targetofspam.) What made it such a good stunt? It was entirely plausible. A large percentage of players were willing to believe Verant would put in a completely unwanted, undesirable change that could serve no purpose but to make the players miserable.</p>
<p>Why this is funny escapes me.</p>
<p>Props to Flicker the Mad Coyote for fixing my stupid yellow monitor problem. While many of you kindly emailed me your suggestions and advice, for which I thank you, Flicker's tip on removing the dust from the inside of the monitor was the one that worked. That's a couple hundred bucks I can now spend on cheap wine and cigarettes.</p>
<p>Time to rant! See y'all later on.</p> 
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE - 3/30/01</p>   
<p>When I got back to work after lunch, the usual receptionist wasn't there. She's the source of the plague I was talking about yesterday, and apparently she finally succumbed. Instead, there was a temp. A male temp. With the Lum the Mad page open. I was so damn happy to meet someone who fit my definition of normal I think I scared him. Like all women, I can smell fear on a man, but I acted against instinct and backed away reassuringly. When I wandered past the desk on my way out the door, THE TWEETY page was open. This time I was the scared one, and ran like a rabbit. So, uh, hi a_male_temp00, I hope you were entertained.</p>
<p>For all three of my readers who are not also Lum readers, check out <a href="http://minievil.eviloverlord.com/lists/overlord.html">this link</a>. Screw "The Rules," to hell with "Life's Little Instruction Book," I've found my map to success.</p>
<p>My thinly veiled snicker at UO people having their turn in the barrel was ill timed. Verant, never content with the number two spot in customer service (with service defined as no-lube gang banging), today decided that WE DON'T NEED NO STINKING FEEDBACK. Rant's to your right, and have a good weekend.</p>   
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE - 3/29/01</p>
<p>Reading Lum's the other day, I came across a thread wherein some folks were arguing about grief players. Several of the combatants seemed to be using, as their basic premise, that the vast majority of people will behave with honor in a multiplayer game with no boundaries or enforced rules. They kept talking about the tiny minority of players that ruin the fun for everyone. While I do think the walking fungi who corpse camp, and shriek badly typed expletives every time they gank someone eight levels under them are in fact a minority, I would have said that the vast majority of players aren't so much honorable as they are apathetic. "Hey, it's not happening to me, should I care?" I'd also say that the vast majority of players will in fact occasionally do rude things under the cover of total anonymity. He without sin may cast the first spell.</p>
<p>Regarding the whole UO2 meltdown, I came away from that with one basic observation - while MMOG gamers may form a community, it's by no means homogenous. UO players heard the news, and the gnashing of teeth could be heard all the way on the eleventh floor of my office building. EQ players, on the other hand, pretty much all reacted with either "So?" or "Ha ha, YOUR turn to get completely dicked!" Makes me wonder though - what will happen to EQ2?</p>
<p>Nyeh, ignore me, I'm in a rotten mood. Trying to fend off the newest version of the plague, I've been consuming a lot of liquid. If I were any better hydrated, I'd be a fucking rice paddy. Hoping to finish a rant for tomorrow; see you then.</p>
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE - 3/26/01</p>
<p>I have come to the conclusion that I am old. I was too tired after work on Friday to put in my contact lenses before I went to hang out with friends. After a whole two alcoholic beverages, I stopped drinking because I didn't want to get drunk. At about one AM, I was so damn tired I needed to go to bed. The final touch was when I got home, I realized that the "raucous party" that had so drained me was a couple of friends hanging out in a condo watching Farscape and telling stories. To hell with the calendar, my brain says I'm old. To further cement that realization, I spent the rest of the weekend gardening, discussing the care of iris plants with my neighbor, watching the History channel, and dicking around with computer games. The eighteen year old still living inside my head is thoroughly disgusted with the pedestrian creature I grew up to be.</p>
<p>Long time readers may recall my obsession with the old Infocom games, and my drooling fangirl reaction when one of the original Infocom programmers wrote me a note. (If you're new to Tweety Land, or if you're too young to know what I'm talking about, think Zork. Think Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Think interactive text based games. You know, the dark ages of pre-graphic computer entertainment, which was all of fifteen years ago.)</p>
<p>I enjoy a good laugh at the people who take MMOG entertainment so seriously that they need medication. At the same time, no fan of the genre should do so without realizing that they're laughing at themselves as well. Why? To your right. Enjoy your Monday.</p>
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE - 3/23/01</p>
<p>Do all the small gods of gaming just hate me? My monitor is about to blow up - I'll be typing along, happy as a clam, and then BAM! YELLOW. Instead of white. Of course it's the freaking monitor, you know, the expensive part of a computer. I was going to celebrate getting a permanent job by buying a really big honking monitor, but since I have as yet no reason to celebrate, I get to tolerate the yellow color for a while yet. Funny, it doesn't do this when I'm playing games. I guess it realizes I might put my foot through it if it goes screwy in a game.</p>
<p>My email has gone insane, with a lot of first time readers writing in with their comments. Welcome. Where the hell did you people come from? Just so's you know, I rarely answer email, but I read and appreciate every one. Intelligent counterpoints are always welcome, and occasionally posted.</p>
<p>Man, talk about depressing. The story is on Lum's - EA blew up and fired a ton of people. Does anyone else think cutbacks in MMOG developers is just stupid if there really is going to be a recession? Ragnerok shared a great comment with me: "If any company can be successful in a recession, it's one that makes MMOGs. Think about it - dollar for dollar it is the cheapest entertainment possible, and unemployed people have plenty of time to play them."</p>
<p>No time to rant this week, even if I have plenty to rant about. Instead, have another Brief Aside, and have a good weekend, gang.</p>
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE - 3/20/01</p>
<p>The Navy is currently developing some techniques to use on prisoners of war. It being the US Navy, they've farmed the task of refinement out to contractors. The contractors, knowing that to experiment on citizens of Third World countries would be to bring about international sanction, have hired temps to experiment on. The object is to cause sudden situational psychosis in the victim, so that the victim will say or do anything to make the pain stop. The method? Take five years of memorandums. Pull one from the stack. Fill out a form containing the same information as the memo, attach the two papers, and stack them in a box for someone else to scan into a database. Repeat. For eight hours. In an office building in Crystal City, Virginia, that does not employ a single human being interested in video games, 80s music, or Heinlein novels.</p>
<p>Yeah, I'm still temping.</p>
<p>Moving right along, the latest thing to piss me off is the bad grammar and spelling that creeps its way into our text based entertainment. Today's rant is dedicated to Mrs. Currie, an English teacher in Fairfax County, Virginia. Ah, Fairfax - one of the wealthiest counties in the country, with resources galore. Yet somehow, they've hired the English teacher who tutored Dan Quayle. An English teacher, with a documented inability to spell, or tell the difference between the past and present tenses. Who corrects a student's correctly spelled word by substituting a misspelled version. No wonder the kids can't spell online.<p>    
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE - 3/16/01</p>
<p>Well, Bob Heinlein said it best when he made TANSTAAFL the motto of the future. (It stands for "There ain't no such thing as a free lunch." Fucking heathen. Go read <u>The Moon is a Harsh Mistress</u>.) Following the latest hot trend of implosion comes the EZBoard system, beloved message boards of the teeming masses of gamers due primarily to it being free to anyone with a pulse and a keyboard.</p>
<p>It's not dead yet, but when a board admin starts getting two or three emails a week asking very nicely to please volunteer to send fifteen bucks, well, you know the end is near. Also, the gossip is the folks running EZBoard are telling potential financial partners that the future of EZBoard is pay to play. And you know what? It's fine by me. It's a pain-free message board, with simple tools for internet feebs such as myself, and their customer support is actually useful.</p>
<p>Why is it fine by me? Why am I not screaming my little chirpy lungs out over the AUDACITY of my free message board service eventually asking me for money? To your right. And forgive me, I'm so damn depressed over this "economic slowdown" I could puke, because it's our own fucking fault as consumers with a sense of entitlement.</p> 
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE - 3/8/01</p>
<p>Man. You know how, when you have a bad day, you say to yourself at some point "well, fuck it. Today sucked the sweat off a weasel's balls, but tomorrow is going to be better"? I've had two straight weeks of days like that. The next person who tells me "into each life some rain must fall" is going to get one of these fucking hailstones that keep hitting me in their teeth.</p>
<p>I think yesterday was the low point. I was given an ad to place on various online job boards, and I happened to notice some grammatical and spelling errors. The worst of the latter wasn't really a spelling error, because the word was technically spelled right. The copy read "Does this job peak your interest?" Those of you who do not realize that the proper word is "pique," please shut the fuck up. I made the corrections, and ran my copy past the supervisor. Who promptly said, "No, the word is "peak."" I didn't quite know what to say, because life has taught me that referring to one's supervisor as "braindead moron" is something of a faux pas. I said something along the lines of "Er, it's actually spelled "pique" when used that way," hoping that for the love of assmonkeys the woman would drop it. She said, "Excuse me, but I think I know how to spell. Post it as is, please." I'm thinking to myself, an advertising firm is about to post a job for a copywriter with a blatant error to half a dozen job boards, how ironic. Then I realized the woman probably couldn't spell ironic, let alone define it. I, being the strong minded person you know and love, said, "Sure thing." At five o'clock I was informed that I didn't fit in and was asked not to return. I'd never been fired from a temp job before, and I found it an odd experience.</p>
<p>So this month, I find myself choosing between internet access and other bills. The choice is clear. Who needs running water when you have the internet? Christ, I need to go back to writing porn. That brought in money.</p>
<p>Rant's to your right, have a good weekend, and wherever you are, slug back some cheap wine for me.</p>
