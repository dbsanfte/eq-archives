<p>I'm not one of those neutered idiots who think men and women are exactly the same. If someone with longer arms and better upper body strength wants to carry a huge awkward package for me, and all he wants in return is a smile and a glance at my cleavage, I fail to see how I've gotten the short end of the stick. But anyway. Aside from the obvious differences that can be seen by anyone who logs off the computer long enough to get someone naked, we're different in more subtle ways. I'm going to generalize here, so if you're a kind sensitive male with nothing but love in your heart, please don't write. If you're an evil bitch goddess who can cuss better than any man and you never wear dresses if you can help it, for the love of god, read my site. I believe I realize such women exist. So here goes. Women tend to be more intuitive. Men tend to be more action oriented. Men call truces, women make peace. Women make long term plans more often than their on-the-spot brothers.</p>
<p>Women tend to empathize more than men. We chicks, even us hard nosed types, tend to identify with every fucking thing on the planet. Our dolls and stuffed animals have feelings when we're little - your average girl does not set her action figures on fire to see what will happen. Sure, we'll watch you do it because we're as fascinated by burning stuff as you are, but most of us will not in fact set fire to Barbie, however tempting it is to frag that stupid bitch, because most of us think we can hear her scream.</p>
<p>Get this straight, right now. We are not wimps because we don't like being mean. We are not victims because we don't crush people like bugs. I'm really sick of "pussy" being an insult, and "you've got balls" being a compliment. It takes more balls to be a pussy. To put yourself in the shoes of someone you'd rather set on fire. To be so strong you can set aside your own self for ten minutes and listen to someone. To hear your body parts used as the cruelest insults anyone can muster. To have all your society's heroes be something you biologically can never, ever be.</p>
<p>So of course, with all the prejudices and narrow minded bullshit in our day to day lives, we haul the entire vomitous mass of bile and baggage into our games. Some of it is inflicted on us, such as the default naked elf in a thong look so popular with your basic adolescent still jacking off to comic books. And some of it is entirely self inflicted, like the complaining I've heard over Dark Age of Camelot's character animations. They've done something novel at Mythic - when the female characters run, they don't run like males. They move as though their mass and center of gravity is different. And when they sit, their legs are together and out to the side, with all the weight on one hip. Why do the girls look different from the boys? Copper, World Developer at Mythic Entertainment, says, "[a female friend and colleague] banged and banged on the artists and animators, because [the original models] were not moving in accordance with female anatomy. I know the walking/running/sitting were done to reflect that. It wasn't that the art guys didn't care or didn't want women to wiggle correctly. It was much more that it is HARD to get hip wiggle down right without Mo-cap." But they did it anyway. They busted their butts to go the extra mile in terms of realistic depiction, and the result was… complaining?</p>
<p>What the fuck? It's not like it's going to be a realistic game in all respects! Female avatars are not limited to any certain role or stereotype. They aren't going to be barefoot, pregnant, and limited to weaving while the boys go out storming the castle. Are some of you so bored that you have to get angry about this? I'd like being a feminist to have some fucking credibility. I'd like serious issues to be addressed with a thousand female voices. You know, like being able to work with a male boss without him writing my employee evaluation with his cock. That's an issue. Not getting your panties up your ass so far that your breath smells like your douche because your character's hips swing when you walk. Get a camcorder ladies, your ass does swing when you walk. Get over it.</p>
<p>Why does anyone even care? You don't see males getting all bent because not once in their wildest wettest dreams are they ever going to be as buff as a male human EQ monk. My theory is that most girls never hung out at the arcade or spent entire summers in front of the Nintendo. Our characters are little extensions of us, whereas men grow up having no emotional attachment to their pixellated representation. It embodies nothing beyond two quarters and a joystick.</p>
<p>I understand the concept behind the reaction, of course. The main thing women are sick and tired of is stereotyping, being pigeonholed, and categorized. We get dismissed when we get defined more narrowly than Jesse Helm's mind. We don't want to be forced into thongs, slutty dresses, or ladylike mannerisms. We want to be seen as individuals, who don't have to conform to a role written for us by someone else. We're so sick of it in real life that we react badly when we see it getting forced on us in any situation. And you know, sitting with your legs crossed at the knee is bad for your circulation and makes your crotch sweat. Sitting like that doesn't make me a lady, it makes me an idiot for buying into someone else's definition of a woman. I want to choose how I come across, and have my definition of a woman be as good as the ones inflicted on me. IN MY REAL LIFE. As long as my little pixel pet has some dignity, and armor that might stop more than traffic, I can't bring myself to care.</p>
<p>In the end, it IS about choice. Do you want your bandwidth taken up with seven hundred character animations so your real life baggage doesn't interfere with your gaming, or do you want decent monster AI? What? You think the animations should be the priority? Royal fucking wah.</p>
