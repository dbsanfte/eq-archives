<p>It's been said before, and it bears repeating. PEOPLE ARE BROKEN. Logging on to EQ is like entering a seventh grade cafeteria.</p>
<p>With the exception of Ebay farmers, these games are not jobs. We play them for a variety of reasons, but high on the list is "escape from reality." (Followed closely by "hanging out with people who talk about dragons and elves with a straight face," but I digress.) The only limit to who "you" are is set in your imagination. You, the pussy who worries about minutia like hypodermic needles in change return slots, can be the warrior who says with a mad glint in his eye, "Today is a good day to die." You, the schmuck rolling pennies to pay the pizza guy, can toss priceless gems to a stranger in thanks for a trifle. You, the tone deaf dolt who can't sing along with your Styx collection without making the dog cry, can be the popular bard whose music is in demand for dungeon raids. </p>
<p>So what do these cocksuckers bring into Everquest as they leave their lamerhood behind? Pettiness, insecurity, stupidity, and such a fragile sense of self that they have to denigrate everyone around them so that they can more fully enjoy clicking on a large hairy beetle and punching their hotkeys.</p>
<p>"MY" orc, "MY" crocodile, "MY" aviak - what the fuck? I won't claim I never got worked up when something I had been attacking got "stolen." The difference between you and normal people is that I got over it. One little numbnuts ripped into me because he thought I was someone who had Ksed him in Birdland. Turned out to be a case of mistaken identity, similar name and all that, but imagine my surprise when I typed /who all CheesyDick - a level 41 wizard? I thought maybe it was his twink who'd been done wrong… but it was him. Twenty levels later, this piddling pissant still wasn't over a dispute over a rook. Isn't there medication for that these days?</p>
<p>I don't understand you weenies who feel personally threatened by someone giving you advice in a video game. EQ has been out long enough that there aren't THAT many true newbies left. The odds are good that if the level 20 gnome caster is giving you monk advice, she probably played a human monk up to the high forties, and might have a vague clue as to what she's talking about. So when you start crying about how you don't have to listen to a caster about playing a monk, don't get confused when she bails on your group. That's usually a sign, right there, you clueless fuck. The longer someone has been in Norrath, the less likely they are to stay in a worthless group with a dickless mongoloid for a leader. Also, when the gnome in question calls you a dickless mongoloid, and suggests a protective helmet, you should conclude that she's not going to come back to your group. That means STOP SENDING HER TELLS. Getting overrun by orcs because pulling is too confusing for your lobotomized ass isn't productive or fun.</p>
<p>It's supposed to be all about having fun. Why does it seem like so many people aren't having fun anymore? And instead of just LOGGING OUT, these people look for new and exciting ways to have fun. Like blocking zone lines. The most pathetic newbie knows about the bugged zone line from Qeynos Hills to West Karana. (In case you've never been near that area due to your race - you have to go through one by one. If two people hit the zone at the same time, one of them is going to pop out on the other side and promptly get kicked back to where they came from. Anyone standing just on the other side of the border acts like a pinball bumper.) This isn't a dungeon, where I could understand people clumping up near the zone line. This is possibly the most underpopulated area in the game in terms of monsters. And everyone within /say range can hear the asshole laughing about how the people on the other side of the line probably think the WK zone is down. (Hey, schmuck boy, that level three character that brought the werewolf and all those beetles? That would be me, with every single buff and damage absorber level 50 shamans, clerics, and enchanters can cast. Love ya, mean it!)</p>
<p>Finally, I wish someone could explain "uber" to me. Before my guild got bored with EQ and moved on to new and exciting things like "sex with spouse" and "going to work," I guess we were an "uber" guild. We did dragons and planes without outside help. But maybe we weren't a real uberguild, because we didn't think we had a monopoly on the game (well, and we were too small to sustain the EQ presence after the founders got bored and quit). I never ran around telling people they couldn't camp at a certain spot because my guild had reserved it for leveling me. Unless your guild is based on something besides the level of the characters who are permitted to join it, that tag you wear is meaningless. Walk into any other server, and no one is going to care. Being one of the *Sperm Weasels* does not entitle you to a damn thing. Don't be so arrogant - sperm DIES after it gets jerked out. You can prove this with a simple experiment - does the crust on your hand move on its own at all?</p>
<p>See you in Shadowbane, or whatever game finishes beta first, weasel dick. </p>
