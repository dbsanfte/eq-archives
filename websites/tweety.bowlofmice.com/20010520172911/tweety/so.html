<p>So, you log onto the Qrack, and you're looking for something to do. Let's see, /who all cleric 55-60 is a decent way to find out what's being camped… Hate is camped, first and second floor. Fear got cleaned out this morning by that damn Euro guild. Sky is being raided. Velk's Lab is camped. Seb has how many people? 94? Jesus. Karnor's makes you want to barf. The royal family of Chardok is being assaulted. Howling Stones is being camped in all three wings plus an entry group. Trak is dead. Wuoshi is dead. Venril Sathir is dead. Hell, even Gorenaire is dead. ToV is under attack. Western Wastes is too far to walk. Siren's Grotto is annoying. Dain is going to be dead as soon as that almost uber crew can wake up the fourth cleric. The EFREETI is camped. All the monks have their epics already, the clerics all have twinks in Naggy's lair, and the wizards don't give a damn anymore. Dammit, there's nothing to do.</p>
<p>So you decide to go get some stuff for your pixellated Barbie doll. You don't actually PLAY your twink, but you sure like to dress it up. It's an Iksar. You feel a little silly, because EVERYONE has an Iksar twink, but they're just so damn cute. You look over her toys, and you realize she's still wearing patch hide sleeves. That just won't do! Azure sleeves will do nicely until you can do some research and find out which sleeves would be best.</p>
<p>So you wander down to Lower Guk. You methodically beat your way down to the pat room, and whack everything into pulp. When you bother looting, you destroy everything but the mesh armor, thinking it would be sort of neat to give a full suit of mesh to a newbie, assuming you can find an actual newbie and not someone wearing a fungi tunic wielding a tranquil staff at level six. When the patriarch pops, you swear under your breath when you realize he's wielding a sword, but you nuke him anyway in hopes that it's a fine steel weapon and he also has the coveted sleeves.</p>
<p>So it's not your day, and it's the Ebony Blade of Mediocrity. Ranger only. You chuckle, remembering the Old Days of Everquest, when people actually played rangers as their primaries. You loot the sword, and head back up into Upper Guk.</p>
<p>So you're sauntering past the camp spots of yore, remembering powerlevelling sessions with a fond smile on your face, when someone shouts "camp check." The names scroll across your chat box with nostalgic familiarity. Ancient. Squire. Lord. Spiders. Waterfall. Every single camp is taken, and you take a shot at giving away the sword. Anyone want the ranger weapon off the pat? Free to lowbie.</p>
<p>There is no immediate reply. You almost feel bad, remembering the day when a pat room raid took six or more coordinated, dedicated people, and the sword a much desired item. Some programmer lovingly designed that sword, thinking how happy someone would be to have it drop - the culmination of hard work and skill.</p>
<p>So you're almost happy when you get a tell from the squire room, from someone who wants it. You make your way across the plank bridge, brushing aside the little frogs, until you come face to face with… a single druid. Who is camping the squire for the runed bone fork to give to his warrior twink.</p>
<p>On a whim, you hit enter, backslash, enter. The list of the players in Upper Guk unfurls on your screen.</p>
<p>58 monk<br>
54 necro<br>
60 warrior<br>
59 warrior<br>
49 druid<br>
55 enchanter<br>
9 shadowknight</p>
<p>So you think to yourself - what the hell is that level nine guy doing in Upper Guk, anyway?</p>
