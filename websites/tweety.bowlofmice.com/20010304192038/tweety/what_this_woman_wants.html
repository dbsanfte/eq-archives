<p>All I wanted out of EQ was a piece of shiverback armor. The top piece, specifically, because it showed off the cooleroo tattoo monks have. I have to admit I was pretty happy with my foreman's tunic though, because frankly, as blocky chunks of pixels go, I was pretty stacked. Not once in EQ did I ever face any comments about my honkers more than once from any one cretin. /Ignore is pretty effective, and failing that I had a big flashing guild tag that indicated a fair number of high level characters ready and willing to deliver a lesson in manners. </p>
<p>I really only dealt with the cretins a few times, though. Some of you may have picked up on the fact that I communicate my intent and feelings through written text fairly well. In addition, my personality type is more "one of the boys" than "fair maiden to be pursued and tongue lashed." An absence of flirting from me, a bunch of big tough players at my back (I didn't say males, I said players, because it doesn't matter what the 56th level troll really has for genitalia), and a nasty vengeful temper - they all add up to "total lack of harassment." Thus, in EQ, I was able to display my virtual charms and enjoy the advantages that chicks with big boobies always have with NONE of the drawbacks.</p>
<p>And I am the exception that proves the rule. Between guiding and talking to other female avatars, I heard about harassment, spamming, lewd remarks, and /ignore lists that filled up in a single playing session. Female avatars without big mean guilds found themselves harassed straight out of the game. I would say, based on information I personally have access to, that real life females who admitted being female came in for the worst. It's like the assholes could tell who might be a wee bit sensitive about some subjects, and went out of their way to be as foul as possible. Sure, anyone can pretend they're male in real life, but why should someone have to do that? Why does it seem like saying, "yeah, I'm a real chick" seem to have the same effect as "yeah, I'm a dancing bear"? </p>
<p>(Tweety bonus section: Two points if you can tell me who originally said that "A woman succeeding in business is like a bear winning a dance contest. The wonder is not that the bear won, it's that the bear could dance at all.")</p>
<p>Where do these cretins come from? Oh, boy, I get to go back to my favorite theme - these assholes are, say it with me, not the majority. I had many, many friends in game who would never dream of treating a woman that way, not in real life or virtual. I would say that out of 1800+ regular players on my server, the number of true chauvinist pigs could be counted on my fingers. Some days I had to take my socks off to keep count, but those were rare. No "men are pigs" ranting from me, because that's about as accurate as "women are sows with no math skills."</p>
<p>Bear that in mind when you read the following: Computer games, be they MMORPGs or RTS or FPS or WTF else, are systematically biased against women. I'm not talking about a bunch of fucking pixels, I'm not talking about inane rescue-the-stupid-bitch quests, I'm not even talking about the squealing idiot in the background of Might and Magic ("yes, oh omnipotent one!"). I am referring to the single player games that assume the player is male. I'm talking about cover art better suited to Playboy than WalMart. I'm talking about the condescending, snot nosed attitude that occasionally erupts from GMs (not guides, though - women may only be 7% of the EQ population, but they're 30% of the guides, snicker). An atmosphere which objectifies women is pervasive and encouraged by quests, costume choices, language, and even sound effects - ever wonder why a male human sort of grunts upon receiving a fatal wound, and a female lets out the most annoying squeal ever heard outside a pig sty?</p>
<p>Why does this bias exist? Simple - because women only recently became a presence (and thus an economic factor) in the gaming community. Let's face it, since these games are not marketed to women, women did not until recently purchase these products in a statistically significant number. In addition, women were at first not well represented in the group of people that were "into" computers. I was the only chick in the computer club in junior high. Neither of these factors really apply anymore, but until women are better represented among programmers and techies, the perception of women being computer illiterate and uninterested in computer games will persist.</p>
<p>I avoided the stink over at Lum's largely because by the time I realized there WAS a stink, it had degenerated into the biggest mass of silliness and circle jerking ever seen, complete with four thousand people repeating the same two points instead of nodding to themselves when someone else achieved rationality. Normally those threads are so…intellectual. I assume there were millions of first time visitors. (Hypocrisy alert: I posted for the first time in that thread myself.)</p>
<p>While the way the argument was conducted (between author and readers) left a bit to be desired, the author of the AC's-red-dress-is-bad article WAS misunderstood. Whose fault that was is irrelevant to the topic. She was attempting to say, among other things, that clothing such as a low cut dress contributes to an atmosphere in which women are objectified. Her concern was that the addition of such clothing would thus create such an atmosphere in a game she perceived to be previously devoid of such things. </p>
<p>And people went absolutely fucking rabid. She got called names, she was personally attacked, her sexuality was questioned, her writing skill disparaged. I'll tell you, I completely <b>disagreed</b> with her perception of the dress, and the sweeping generalization she made about women who would choose to wear such a dress. The frothing fuckheads completely missed her real point, however - these games, which are usually played by normal men and women, are often reduced to jackoff material for socially inept bozos because those bozos pay out the money for the longest stretches of time. Just as Verant assumes their customers are morons because all they read is Whineplay, game designers often assume all men want women with huge honkers because those are the people they hear from. Clue train a-coming, dipshits - not all men are obsessed with breasts. Some men are obsessed with asses, too. Not all men even want women at all, if you can catch my drift. I'm not saying that Turbine is creating a poor environment for women, and neither was she. </p>
<p>I would ask future designers not to design a game intended to attract women, but to design a game in which women feel welcome. That means include the slutty dresses (because there's plenty of us who'll wear them), but don't make the default a mostly naked twit. Keep the eye candy evenly distributed between the sexes. Create a zero-tolerance policy towards foul mouthed louts, but hire customer service people who can tell the difference between light hearted teasing and vicious attacks. Don't cater to a female market, because that's in many ways worse than ignoring us. Give us a choice between Laurana the Golden General and Xena Warrior Princess. It's the atmosphere, not the clothes, stupid.</p>
<p>I would ask the following of normal male players, who are by now thinking "what the fuck am I allowed to say without setting off a psychotic episode." Relax and climb down from the defensive tree, for one thing. You haven't done anything wrong. It's been my experience that males who are heavily into computers and games tend to be the nicest, calmest guys in real life, possibly because you blow up pixels instead of beating up people. The secret to communicating with female players is easy - assume that the woman at the other keyboard is your mother, your sister, your girlfriend, or your wife. If you would actually say something like "is ur pussy wet cuz I got a sword 4 it" to any of those women, you deserve the reaming you're about to get from me and the three thousand normal guys who think you're an asshole.</p>
