<p>Hoo boy. Some people collect dippy little Hummel figurines, some people collect Star Trek toys, but I collect signs of the coming apocalypse. I just feel like any reasonable higher power will soon take a plunger to the world and remove the giant hunks of shit blocking up the communication pipes. Anyway, the world of gamers has provided me with another sign for my collection. No, no, not the collectible Everquest toys, although that did make me whip out the holy water. I'm talking about Shadowbane guilds, currently holding practices, discussions, and diving headfirst into the empty swimming pool of guild politics. That's right, you heard me, Shadowbane. The game that doesn't get released until late next spring or early summer.</p>
<p>The argument seems to be that if they've already created a virtual empire, it should translate instantly to the game. By getting people to commit to characters and classes now, these forward thinking creatures think they can avoid the plague of EQ ("We can't do this raid without an enchanter/monk/cleric/leader with balls! Why oh why do we have seven hundred necros and nothing else?"). How many of you figured out what class/race you were born to play the first time you ever rolled a character? Oh, sit down, all four of you. And I'm not talking about long standing player guilds. Guilds consisting of a group of buddies that have played together no matter what the game are very different from these chimpanzees. The idea of slapping up a website, and thinking that's just as good as long term relationships gained from playing together is the most hilarious thing to cross my desktop in weeks. I found five "guilds" with this mentality, and I only made a half assed attempt at finding them.</p>
<p>Some of these testicle twiddlers are missing the point altogether. One application has the line "Please rate yourself as a roleplayer from 1-5, one being pure PVP and five being pure Roleplayer." Huh? Some of the scariest PVP guys I know are some seriously sick and demented roleplayers. How on earth does that question assess any useful skill at all? Judging from the website I found that question on, this group is planning on being Serious Roleplayers. So, with that in mind, they don't seem to want the "1" people on the above scale. In a PVP game. One being marketed at the die hard PVPers who want a challenge.</p>
<p>In case the guys planning Shadowbane guilds with all your close personal friends from the dev boards didn't notice, Shadowbane is going to be a wee bit different from UO and EQ. About the only skills that are going to carry over are your decision making skills, and from the looks of some of these websites, you need to brush those up a smidgen. Pretending you know all there is to know about an unreleased game is not the only problem with virtual organization. Plans are great - until the battle of reality starts up. The best talker on the boards is often the least capable of leading a raid on anything bigger than his fridge. Writing inspiring board posts is great and all, but can you plan a defense?</p>
<p>At least one of these guilds is making no bones about how they plan to achieve everlasting glory in a video game - only applicants with a Shadowbane beta account are welcome. "We only take the elite, the best, the experienced, the wise… oh, and we only take the people who will have a chance to learn the interface before the game opens." Sorry, spanky, but that only means your members will know how to roll a character. You still won't have the faintest fucking clue on how to interact with an entire teeming mass of kill crazy EQ refugees. Your beta strategies are going to be great - for a beta population.</p>
<p>Some of these ninnies are so wrapped up with internal politics that they've even started to ban some of their members for "behavior unbecoming to a member of Dasooper Dumbasses." The hierarchies of the theoretical guilds are adjusting on their… ezboards…as I type this. Others present a "united" front, and take this entire charade to a new low by TROLLING OTHER GUILD BOARDS. My favorite example of this was from a link one of the KAAOS members sent me, alerting me to the presence of some dingbat trolling on his/her board, on how his (currently theoretical) guild was going to completely own KAAOS (a guild that has been around as long as my guild, working on a decade here). The reason given? Because the vaporguild has more Shadowbane beta accounts than the existing guild. Um, yeah. Spending a couple months practicing in a beta environment is TOTALLY going to make up the difference between you and a bunch of people who've been playing together for years. Thank god my crew uses a private email list to communicate. The blood after the older players got done with these nitwits would gross me out.</p>
<p>Finally, the best entertainment comes from people declaring war on other guilds before the game even starts. So, correct me if I'm wrong. A guild that doesn't exist is declaring war on a guild that does exist in a game that doesn't exist using mysterious foresight of how much non-existent power any particular guild will manage to garner in a game in which the guilds starting out with territory have yet to be determined. One of the most hilarious sites has already declared war on three different guilds. </p>
<p>Did anyone think of letting the game get released and seeing what it was like first? Maybe even finding out if you were one of the lucky few to start off with some territory before you started planning your central castle? Proving your skills in Shadowbane (which no one has yet) before you set yourself up as the Biggest Chimp in the Tree? </p>
<p>(I really considered including links to these guys, but then I realized it would be like beating a cripple. Fun for a minute, maybe, but not worth the time it would take to answer all the email from these feebs. I will give you <a href="http://www.fpdoms.com"><span class="greenLink">one funny moment</span></a>, though. I'm pretty sure this site is a joke, but I'm JUST uncertain enough find it hilarious.)</p>
<p>All this, for a game that does not technically exist at this time. Oh, I grant you it will exist, no argument on that point, I'll be playing it myself, but I'm dying to know where the "squads" are "training." I knew those clever devils at Wolfpack were good, but I didn't know the screenshots and rendered art clips were good enough to hold PRACTICES on them. I love people, I really, really do.</p>
