<p>The biggest fiction in Everquest besides "it's a role playing game, we swear," is the "random" spawn timer. Big dragons are on a random timer. Quest mobs for certain camp a thon epic quests are on a random timer. Monsters for the shove-hot-wires-under-your- toenails VP key quest are on a random timer. Heck, even some of the mobs for moving-up-the-chart-with-a-bullet Coldain Ring quest are on a random timer.</p>
<p>WHATEVER. It's true if "random" is defined as "you got a sixty second leeway." To avoid cries for blood and stem cell tissue, Verant must bring down servers for patch day in the wee hours of the morning, Pacific Standard Time. And precisely 18, 36, 14 hours later, people set up camp at the spawn location of Phat Loot Mob X. Precisely that many hours later, the process is repeated, and often the same people are involved. Heck, Lodizal is famous for people making s'mores and singing campfire songs in its vicinity every nineteen hours. The location of little tents in that area is in my opinion some sort of ironic joke on the part of a Verant world builder. You can set your watch by these people. If you die in a zone containing these randomized mobs, no worries! Simply wait for that RANDOM spawn time to roll around, and the place will be crawling with clerics who'll be happy to whack you with the RARE AND SPECIAL rezz stick that NOT EVERYONE IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE. Oh, sorry, different rant intruding there.</p>
<p>I understand the purpose of a random timer. It means that instead of having the same guild farm the same mob over and over, everyone has a chance to camp a twink on the spot and hopefully get lucky and mobilize their guild fast enough to whack it. This is a noble purpose. So why doesn't it work that way?</p>
<p>Is there something inherently difficult about making a spawn time random? I have a very dim memory of the frogs in Lower Guk being changed from a heartbeat steady eighteen minute repop to a slightly more disconcerting 18 to 24 minute cycle. What would be so damn difficult about fixing the Trak Teeth dragon so that he pops anywhere from two hours to thirty-six after his death? Or how about the tried and true placeholder method? Everyone has a happy memory of strolling through the Commons, whacking baby bears, and suddenly a big ass griffin swoops down and knocks you upside the head so hard that half the time you're not even sure what killed you. (In my opinion, a big part of what makes Everquest fun - heart stopping terror - went away when the servers matured. Now you just holler "giant between p1 and dock" and six dozen high levels run over and compete for the one monster that gives exp in the zone.) How hard could it be to make Wuoshi spawn like that?</p>
<p>Dragons like Sushifucker piss me off on general principles anyway. He's a sterling example of Verant tuning all the serious mobs to the specifications of uber guilds. The big, highly organized killing machines come in and decimate all the lovingly crafted Really Big Critters about six years before the designers expect it. After about two months of slaughter, someone quits playing Magic long enough to notice that the Legion of Sperm has outfitted all its warriors in Breastplates of Badassness and all its casters in Rings of Neener Neener I'm Cooler Than You. The Really Big Critter is promptly given unlimited mana, sow, thorns, and a hide with the same qualities as a goddamn M-1 Abrams tank. Now the thing can only die if your clan is wearing the shit that it drops, and all the people who were waiting until the uber guild got bored and went away are more fucked than Stevie Case at a job interview.</p>
<p>I know that the bigger and more multiplayer a game becomes, the more like real life it will be. This comes complete with haves and have nots, wealth and poverty, strong players and weak. Unlike real life, there are things that could be done to even the playing field that don't involve punishing the ubers for having their shit together. I think it's called using a random spawn timer. Duh.</p>
