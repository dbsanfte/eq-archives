<p>Okay, time to start forming my Christmas list for next year.  My first wish: 
<p>I want to be casting director for the series 'Charmed' on WB. 
<p>Of course, that's if I'm good...which I am.  If I'm bad...which I most 
assuredly would be, if given such a situation...I will settle for wardrobe 
assistant.  If anyone working for WB happens to read this, I will happily 
send a resume and work for the union minimum. 
<p>Thank you. 
<p>*** 
<p>I've said it before and I'll say it again.  American news directors are 
playing it all wrong.  They think they need to trump up news stories and hunt 
politicians like desperados to get ratings.  The assumption is incorrect.   
Now the news is not only boring but it's an unheard of combination of boring 
and twisted. 
<p>The answer: 
<p>Babes. 
<p>No, that's not sexist.  The term can be switched universally...I've heard 
women talk about Mel Gibson...don't act innocent. 
<p>More babes.  Put a slinky doe eyes blonde with something fake under 
her sweater two sizes too small, let HER tell us about blue dresses and Oval 
office cigars.  Let Mel Gibson oil up to reenact the stock market movements 
for the ladies.  Ratings would shoot through the roof and as long as the news 
was well written, we'd be one damn well informed nation. 
<p>Even bad news would be better.  I know I wouldn't mind so much if Fluffy 
Halfsweater were tell me how our public officials had been 'naughty' today. 
<p>You'd watch.  You know you would.  Even if you hated it, you'd have to see it 
just to believe it.  Would be more effective than the Emergency Broadcast 
System. 
<p>Mark my words.  Some spunky news director will catch on and make zillions, 
all the while laughing at the free advertising provided by the mad mothers 
out front waving signs about how much they hate young Ms. Halfsweater. (No 
one would protest Gibson...hell even guys like Gibson.  Good fight scenes.) 
<p>(We at Brief Asides have no comment about this aside at this time.  Thank 
you.) 
<p>***
<p>It's Presidents' Day.  A National Holiday.  Did anyone even notice?  Ok, 
other than the people who work at banks and the people who went to cash in on 
the furniture discounts...anyone else? 
<p>This aside has about as much point as the holiday. 
<p>Now before the mad mothers among you start yabbling about how I should 
respect Presidents, even though, in all honesty...no one else does.  Let me 
say that I mean no disrespect to current or past public figures.  I'm just 
talking about the uselessness of the holiday. 
<p>We have far too many holidays as it is, wasting one on a shitty month like 
February when most people don't even take the day off because their saving 
their time off for when the beaches warm up, is annoying.  It's like those 
lame Canada Holidays they always put on our Calendars, but no one really 
notices until three days later when they say "Hey...I had fish on a holiday.   
That's not a sin anymore is it?" Even Cinco De Mayo is more celebrated and 
most Americans (myself included) don't even know what the hell it means. 
<p>I say we move Presidents Day to May 5th, double the party, take the 6th off 
for Veterans Day, and just cut loose.  Not that anyone will heed such fun 
advice.  More likely they will end up moving Labor Day to mid January, just 
in case anyone was considering taking that day off next year, or add Harrison 
and Taft's birthday to the list so they'll have the needed excuse before 
being able to legally teach history in schools. 
<p>((We at brief asides have decided it really does not matter whether Cinco is 
spelled correctly or not, and to hell with the spell checker.  We promise you, life will go on. )) 
<p>((Brief asides are distributed 'as is' and in such circumstance as life not 
going on, in spite of any guarantees contained herein, we offer not 
compensation of any kind and cannot be held accountable.)) 
<p>((So there.)) 
<p>***
<p>Whew. Covered allot in that last one.  May want to take this freebie to 
digest the influx of useless crap I just threw at you. 
<p>No aside here.  Smoke em if you got em. 
<p>*** 
<p>I'm curious. 
<p>What sort of person do you picture when you see this: 
<p>hi.  r u goin 2 sign on? 
<p>What about this: 
<p>WOOOOOOOT 
<p>or this: 
<p>LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL 
<p>I'm not knocking anyone, just am actually curious. 
<p>***
<p>I've decided you can send me E-mail, if you care.  Too many people think I'm 
Tweety (a bizarre thought, if you saw both of us.  The resemblance pretty 
much ends with the fact that we both wear shoes.)  However, be advised that 
anything you send will need to have the phrase "brief aside" or "Tweety" in 
it or I wont recognize it and will simply delete it along with the 
1746456535252 other spam pieces of shit people send me. 
<p>Alyxz@aol.com 
<p>Don't bother looking at the profile.  It's a screen names used for a game 
called 'duel of Swords'.  I resemble it about as much as I resemble an Iksar 
monk. 
<p>***
<p>Since I mentioned it: What are people thinking when they send those 
1746456535252 pieces of spam E-mail every day?  Do I actually share this 
planet with people stupid enough to believe that this E-mail is going to make 
me slobber of the idea of entering their lame ass contest, or visit their web 
site (fully guaranteed to cause my web browser to spontaneously pop 45 brand 
new windows)? 
<p>Even scarier perhaps, is the thought that I share this world with people 
stupid enough to enter the lame ass contest, or visit the lame ass website. 
<p>The latter is more likely, seeing as how even in my own circle of hand picket 
friends I still occasionally get moronic trash promising that Bill Gates will 
send me $1000, or that my computer will self destruct on March 3. 
<p>It all makes me support the NRA.  The gambler in me hopes that some of the 
wackos with guns will at least take out some of the wackos with E-mail when 
they go on their mad killing sprees.  Sure they may hit me on the way down, 
but I live in the boonies of nowhere land so I figure I've got good odds on 
this one. 
<p>***
<p>I saw Disney's 'A Bug's Life' yesterday, for the first time.  The 
movie itself was okay.  Kinda like 'Antz' only the acting/voice work wasn't as 
good.  Still, it wasn't a bad movie.   
<p>The end credits on the other hand were genius.  Out takes.  For a cartoon.   
Ponder this for a moment. 
<p>Genius. 
<p>Things like that make me wish I still did drugs.  I always did like Disney.   
<p>((We at brief asides support Philip Morris in their campaign to keep America 
Drug free.  Any Substance reference was purely for comedic value.  Don't try 
this at home.))
