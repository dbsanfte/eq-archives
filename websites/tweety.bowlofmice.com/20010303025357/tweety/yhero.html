<p>Epic quests. The phrase summons to mind images of the noble dragonslayers of yesteryear. One man, or maid, riding out against the odds. And returning home again, holding aloft the bloody head of a monster, as the minstrels of the land roam the countryside to spread the tale. The tale itself stirs the blood, and children go to their beds dreaming of becoming brave, noble… kill stealing assholes willing to sacrifice every last shred of self respect just so they can quit camping the rare mob that doesn't even drop experience let alone the goddamn Foreskin of Fabulousness.</p>
<p>The epic quests were designed to be diabolically difficult, requiring patience and teamwork. You're free to start your very own epic quest whenever you like, but it's obviously intended to be part of the "endgame," since every class needs to hit at least one of the planes for a piece. Usually the Plane of Sky, since the quest designers know it's exactly like the sky here in Reality Land - big, and empty of people except for tightly controlled flights.</p>
<p>The logic behind these epic quests seems obvious - give the highest level players in the uber guilds something to do. Remember the old days before any expansion sets had been released? You could saunter through Lower Guk, at level 2, naked, smeared in female frog hormone, and survive the journey without a single scratch because every spawn's lifespan was measured in milliseconds.</p>
<p>And then came Kunark. I remember watching TV a week after Kunark was released, and my roommate came flying up the stairs. He looked at me, and said "There are twenty three people in Lower Guk." That was all he said, and our asses were in the king room ten minutes later. THAT was apparently the goal behind the epic quests. Get people out of Lower Guk: The Next Generation, I mean Seb, and into some underutilized zones. Spread out the clumping. Get people into Sky, Chardok, and Permafrost. When the expansions were released, there was an immediate release in the pressure on "old" zones, that still had desirable gear and experience, and the midlevel players in smaller guilds finally had a shot at doing "big stuff."</p>
<p>The epic quests had no such effect. "Uber guilds" that had long since left Hate and Fear behind were suddenly hogging all the gods again, for one thing, and smaller guilds found themselves shoved aside yet again. Guilds not quite capable of getting red dragon scales from Skyfire began powerleveling twinks to flatten Naggy with. What's sad is these megaguilds with their serious "it's not a game, it's a job" attitude don't even WANT to be hogging the planes and the dragons. They'd be just as happy to leave the old world behind and concentrate on Western Wastes, Veeshan's Peak and Temple, Sleeper's Tomb, and all the big stuff. Nobody wants them to be in Fear night after night, least of all them.</p>
<p>Furthermore, unlike expansion releases, which more or less merely provided more options, the epic quests represented a goal that every player wanted. With the party line from Verant being "They're EPIC, not everyone is going to have one," the large guilds began to take the attitude that unless you belonged to a power guild, you didn't "deserve" to have the hand of Maestro or Cazic's skin, because without an enormous guild you stood no chance of actually finishing your epic quest. And while it's true that without a lot of backup you can't finish this quest, no one likes being told that they can't be the hero or the star of the show - not in a fantasy game. Let's take a poll! If life were like the Princess Bride, would you rather be the Dread Pirate Roberts, or the DPR's bitch? Tensions rose, they haven't stopped rising, and they won't as long as players are made to feel resentful.</p>
<p>Verant's completely incompentent handling of loot tables is also to blame for some of the tension. It's a well known cliché in EQ that immediately after a zone is tweaked, the drops are fast and furious. Guilds capable of exploiting a zone without a lot of preparation tend to score a great deal of gear very quickly. The powers that be behind the game see this, and adjust the drop rates downward. Thus, the guilds who already have an advantage by virtue of their size are often the best equipped as well.  And they got many of their epic components early on. Everyone else is out of luck, and in for weeks of camping.  (You don't believe me? Plane of Growth, when it first opened, dropped piles and piles of nifty gear. The first guilds in wound up with all sorts of toys. Now you might see two pieces after ten hours of raiding. The first people to camp the Warlord Room in Karnor's for the monk epic component would see two or three pawbusters in four hours. Now it's possible to camp the room in shifts for over a hundred hours without seeing a single one. Verant reacts to too many drops in a matter of minutes. Too few drops can take six months to correct.)</p>
<p>But never mind how every non-uber player got fucked, let's talk about the class that took it up the ass so far their lungs are bleeding. The dubious honor goes to wizards. They need a skin of Cazic. An ultra rare drop. Off a god. In a plane that most of the epic questing wizards abandoned ten levels ago. And after all the camping, the accusations of greed and KSing, the mindless staring, the screaming, the whining, and herding your guild into things they don't want to do, what do get? A powerful mana-free nuke? Maybe a translocate stick? Nah - you get a free clickable damage absorber with some kickass stats. Nice item, but worth sitting around for a one in thirty drop off a mob who dies the minute a server comes up after patch day? According to the dozen wizards GAME WIDE who have bothered, not really. The risk is not worth the reward. Not like the cleric epic, where the proud owner prances through fields of corpses, tapping people like a fairy godmother to bring them back to life. As if clerics didn't already get regular offers to have their scrotums licked clean, their epic is actually of epic proportions.</p>
<p>Hey, clue train coming by you, game designers. Everyone wants to be the hero of a quest. Being the poor schmuck cleaning up leftovers and waiting for scraps is called "our real lives," not our fantasy.</p>
