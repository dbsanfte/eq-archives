<p>Due to my thinking that no one would care about the inaccurately named "Weekly Updates" until I got email to the contrary, stuff older than 10/17 is lost forever. Since we're talking about a month and a half's worth of
   stuff, this is no great loss.</p>
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE - 2/23/01
<p>Boy, that patch yesterday was a doozy! (And uh, love y'all, I mean it, but you don't need to email me the patch message, my guild email list provides it to me, not to mention every message board and fansite on the planet.) Possibly the most contentious aspects were the changes to the cleric class. My reaction was unprintable, but a nicely stated opinion came over an email list I belong to. From Ronnie, who possesses a level 60 character and is thus entitled to an opinion, I think:</p>
<p>"The problem isn't that they're "fixing agro for heals" per se, it's that they're choosing to do it NOW. [A guild wizard] made the point that controlling agro is something wizards have had to do forever. Read it again, it's something wizards have had to do FOREVER. The difference between a good cleric and a great cleric is knowing when to heal, when not to heal, and how to do both efficiently. All of a sudden, the 60 levels, the 130 days played, and all the tactics you picked up in your 2 years of playing mean nothing. It's as if Verant decided that Ebayers were the newest charity case and they needed to level the playing field for those poor wretched clueless fucks out there. Funny how rogues got a warning about the evade nerf, and clerics were asked to bend over and take that red hot poker up the ass."
<p>Amen sister. Anyway, here's a new Brief Aside, and y'all have a good weekend.</p>
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE - 2/21/01
<p>You know, I only have one thing to say about boob oriented marketing. It's fine, in small doses, "sex sells" and all that. But how come marketing people have figured out how to sell, say, CARS to both men and women, and yet it can't be done for say, GAMES? The guys who depend solely on tits and ass to sell their products are the same dorks that hang out in IRC whining about how there aren't enough girls in gaming. You think there might be a connection? I play games because once I toss the completely irrelevant box art in the trash, the actual game is usually not offensive or annoying. You want chicks to walk by the store display and pick it up on a whim? Take the naked chick off the box. Duh. At the bare minimum, no pun intended, don't release calendars that fall somewhere between Penthouse and Big Jugs of Cream on the taste meter. Morons.</p>
<p>It's not just gaming boobies that strike me as odd. Porn pictorials in general kinda confuse me. One of my best friend's husbands works as a web editor in the adult entertainment industry, and I was privileged to view his art the other day. While the equipment that can handle three foot long cucumbers is impressive, and indeed, the ability to pick up a can of beer with no hands is certainly a talent of sorts, I don't see the erotic implications. Whenever I meet a man shaped like the aforementioned mutant vegetable, I run screaming from the room. I also don't get why a man would be interested in a woman proportioned in such a way. As the Brief Aside guy says, who'd want to be a pencil in a pail?</p>
<p>Oh, well, today's bitching and moaning is also of epic proportions. See you kids around the barnyard.</p>   
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE - 2/14/01
<p>I'm still job hunting, but now I'm temping as well. My current assignment is a barrel of laughs - I have an inch thick printout of names and addresses, and my task is to call each and every one to verify contact information. I'm getting a bird's eye view of the dot com revolution's bloody underbelly - "He's not here anymore." "May I ask who replaced him?" "Nobody." As I am a temp, and therefore worth something less than well gnawed bubble gum, they have me in a storage room and situated so that my back is to the door. It's about as psychologically comfortable as being naked in a women's prison.</p>
<p>No rant today, I was at Mythic Entertainment Tuesday evening (just barely made it back for Dark Angel - mmm, Logan…) getting all the dirt on DAoC, and I should really post an article on the Corp or something.</p>
<p>For the benefit of all the gaming boys out there who have managed to miss the advertising blitzes, it's Valentine's Day. Don't thank me, just go out and buy something now and pretend you didn't forget. Personally, I'm planning on playing video games and drinking cheap wine with my roommates tonight. For all the gamers reading this who don't need to sweat buying gifts today - remember that love takes a lot of forms. Don't miss what's under your nose because you're crying for the moon.</p>
<p>Special valentine to my roommates, the Tarsis Shriners, and my site regulars. I love you, man!</p>
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE - 2/12/01
<p>Ah, the Test of Tactics, otherwise known as Test of Who Can Stay Connected and Beat Each Other To Death. I love the rules - no clickable items, no charm or fear unless it's on a pet, and other fun bits. In other words, nothing creative allowed at all. I watch the Erollisi Marr ToT over the shoulder of my roommate, who was on a squad. First, I had a good chuckle over the announcement that "the use of a bug or an exploit will result in disqualification and possible action taken against your account." Then, I was thoroughly disgusted when a player suggested that spectators be moved away from the fighting, to lower packet loss and lag - the GM's response was "good idea, but I won't do it at this time." Then I just shook my head when a player went LD during the buffing period. One GM present ruled that the team alternate could not replace the LD player. The other GM said it was okay, but Mr. Negativity won the day. Then, after this team fought with one fewer person for half the battle, the LD player came back in - and the GM stopped the fight because suddenly, it was unfair. Cute. Real consistent. Congrats to all winners across the servers though, because if you can win a contest in that sort of environment, if nothing else you've proved you can survive an insane and incoherent system. That, and your main assist can use mouselook.
<p>Anyway, have a rant, and have a good Monday, gang.
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE - 2/6/01
<p>Job hunting is a WHORE. The wonderful world of freelance writing and editing is tremendously satisfying. I work more hours now than I ever did as a corporate whore, but it's for me, not some idiot in a fugly taupe suit. What is it with corporate women wearing taupe? When my dog throws up, it's that exact color. I guess the freaks wearing it don't own dogs. But I digress. Regretfully, while I find great personal fulfillment in my chosen field, I am out of money. Hint to aspiring writers - when an editor says they pay on publication, be sure to ask what date they intend to publish, and do not quit your day job until that date rolls around. In my case, I've sold enough drivel to feed myself very well… in June. It is February. This is a problem.
<p>Another small problem is Big Bird, my large yellow station wagon, is dead. Pretending the billowing white steam/smoke was the breath of a dragon was fun until it sunk into my head that "blown head gasket" was the truly fearful truth. Now, while I'm a huge fan of public transportation, being a treehugger and all, the fact is that buses are about as reliable as Arafat committing to the peace process. Here in the DC area, I know the train will show up on time, barring explosions. I also know the bus has a 50 50 chance of leaving me standing like a moron hailing a way too expensive cab. So unless I score a signing bonus of around 15K, I need to be able to take a train to work.
<p>So anyway, sorry about the lack of rant, Tweety's been trying to figure out how to put her site on her resume without sending blue haired old women and men in suits into coronary arrest. Got one for tomorrow, though. Have some fresh Brief Aside until then.
<p class="yellow">WEEKLY UPDATE - 2/1/01
<p>Mixed bag of update today. Do not continue if you're one of the people who believe in total consistency. I love y'all more than my luggage, but no, I have no plans to post the photos from the Lost Weekend for public consumption. As I have previously stated, I don't show up on film, so sorry.
<p>Some sad news for players on the Nameless server, if you knew a dark elf cleric named Dovare. The player behind the character died of an asthma attack a few weeks ago. He'll be missed by his family and friends.
<p>Moving on to the "I agreed to do WHAT" category, at some point during the weekend I, and the barbarian hordes in my basement, all signed my copy of Panty Raider with a magic marker. If you for some unknown reason would like to own an autographed Panty Raider game, we're ebaying the thing as a fundraiser (since as of today, Corpnews is without ad sponsorship until our network gets their act together). Go <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=1211880453">here</a> to bid. 
<p>The rant for the day is on a favorite topic of my loyal correspondents, the dreaded lag monster. Check it out, and y'all have a good weekend.
