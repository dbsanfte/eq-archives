<p>Deciding what cartoon avatar you want to represent you is a major decision in our lives, right up there with "takeout Chinese or pizza" in the range of choices available to us middle-class Americans. In times of uncertainty and chaos, we care even more about this decision, because by god it is totally within our sphere of influence.</p>
<p>Human is a good default choice. We ARE human, after all, We know how it should act. How it dresses, what it says, how it moves - this is all familiar territory. Well… for most people. Us exceptions know who we are. Anyway, I can be me, but better. As an actual human, I do stupid shit. For instance, I have been attempting to dye my hair red since I was fifteen, but my dark brown tresses don't take dye well. I've always bought the shiniest copper red possible, and achieved nothing more than glints. I finally gave up on it ten years ago. Well, not quite - the other day, I bought the copper red dye, figuring I needed some highlights, and smeared it on. In case you didn't know, the hair dye formulas have been improved in the last decade. Drastically. They now work on even dark brown hair. Not ALL of the dark brown hair, mind you, just the strip along the top of my head. I looked like a cross between a leprechaun and a skunk. With eyebrows that no longer matched my head. But a toon human? Red hair is a click away. If it ends up looking hideous and you don't know whether you're impersonating Groucho Marx or the Lucky Charms moron? Buy a hooded cape and a nice helm and call it a day.</p>
<p>For some reason, a large number of people are into elves. I mean, frighteningly into elves. The same people dress up as Vulcans at the sci-fi conventions, because it's yet another justification for putting on the pointy ears. Is it some kind of sexual fetish with these people? I'm not mocking anybody, I had one of those little "Starfleet communicator" dealies that made the twitter noise when I pressed it (and boy did I press it, I went through three watch batteries), and a couple times I even sunk so low as to pretend to talk to it. (In my defense, both times I was trying to get away from someone a little too far into the Klingon roleplay persona - no, you latex-encased creep, I wouldn't want to have normal sex with you, let alone indulge in the Klingon mating ritual. When "I don't date outside my species" fails to impart my message, I "answer the beep" from my "commanding officer" and "head for the bridge." Sue me.) Anyway. Elves are lithe, graceful, intelligent, and charming. Thus says the roomful of paperback novels that I have accumulated in the last fifteen years, anyway. So, even though I rather prefer Terry Pratchett's vision of "evil little bastards" I can understand the desire to play such ethereal, magical creatures that are like humans, but better. Way better. Definitely more sexually desirable. Try putting on the ears next time your special friend says they aren't in the mood for love. Blame me if he/she/it cackles at you.</p>
<p>Dwarves are another option. Short, strong, with lots of fictional precedent for slugging back booze and being argumentative. Not a lot of work in roleplaying a dwarf on the simplest level. Of course, there's a downside. Every player driving a tall race suffers from the delusion that they are the FIRST PERSON EVER to come up with the clever visual gag of rubbing their virtual crotch in the face of a dwarf. I've found that these people are easily repulsed with equally original comments about the smell of fish. There's something I don't get. I asked a gynecologist a few months ago if she'd ever encountered an actual fish smell. She said no, although she'd seen a few private bits that could make Don Juan into a monk. So what's with the fish jokes? Is there a particular kind of fish it smells like? If yes, what on earth convinced someone to eat a nasty fish that smelled like that? I've been hungry enough to eat ramen without bothering to cook the noodles, but I've never been THAT freaking hungry.</p>
<p>Kender/kobolds/gnomes/halflings/whatever are sort of like dwarves. They get all the same retarded crotch level humor, but with an added benefit of being expected to act like hyperactive five year olds. I have seen otherwise normal, stable adults start off playing a kender-type character as little more than extensions of themselves, and yet eventually find themselves utterly taken over by the power of the kender. They babble. They prance. They laugh insanely at everything. Frankly, I'd like to say something cynical and bitter here, but I can't. They're so damn fun to have around. An actual hyperactive five year old I find myself wanting to club like a baby seal. Someone acting like a hyperactive five year old is just a hoot. I guess this means my biological clock isn't ticking yet. Actually, I know it's not. A friend at work just became a new parent, but I refuse to look at the pictures yet. I'm sorry, a brand new human is wrinkly, oozing fluid from all available orifices, and covered in mucus. You cannot possibly expect me to coo over that. Call me when its eyes are open and it's housebroken.</p>
<p>I guess you're wondering by now what I chose to play. One of my alts is a troll in my new game. There's no deep-seated psychological reason. It's just that after two plus years of playing a human in EQ, I am sick to freaking death of looking at troll ass during raids. They can all look at my ass for a change.</p>
