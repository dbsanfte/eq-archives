<p>Dear Santa Claus,</p>
<p>It's been awhile since I wrote to you, big guy, and I'm really sorry. Ever since I stopped, I've been getting things like bath and beauty products. ME. The one who wrote and asked you for a Nintendo, the space station Lego set, and a working catapult. Santa, dude, this sucks - why couldn't you have told the grownup version of Santa that smelly soaps give me a rash?</p>
<p>Anyway, I don't play with Legos anymore, but I do play video games. And this is what I want for the holidays.</p>
<p>1. Dark Age of Camelot. I don't need too many changes to this one, Santa, it looks really nice. But could you make the producer stop comparing it to EQ? It's so much more than "EQ without the sucky bits" that he's limiting himself and his market by mentioning EQ whenever he talks about his beautiful and fascinating game.</p>
<p>2. Shadowbane. Could you make it come out SOON, please? My whole guild is planning to invade at the same time, and we're totally excited. Trouble is, we've been waiting so long and with so much excitement that I don't think it's going to be able to live up to our expectations. I don't think ANYTHING could live up to our expectations at this point, and we keep dreaming of more and more with each delayed beta date.</p>
<p>3. Trade skills. No matter what game, it would be neat if I could get experience towards leveling when I work on a trade skill.</p>
<p>4. Melee binding in EQ. After 50, the classes are so interdependent that there is NO EARTHLY REASON to continue to punish the fighters by making them depend on a rezz spell. Couldn't melee binding be put in for the high level players? The ones that must fight ten zones away from a town to get experience?</p>
<p>5. Customer Service. Could I have just one game where the CS staff doesn't automatically assume I'm a lying cheating whore out to fuck them in the goat ass?</p>
<p>6. Anal Retentive Goobers. I remember these guys from AD&amp;D. If we had seven hours to play, they'd spend five of them poring over stat sheets and playing with those damn dice. Now they're spending years screwing with log parsers and spreadsheets, arguing endlessly bloodpoints vs. lams, or sucking vs. blowing, blah blah BLAH. I like to nitpick and bitch and moan, but these guys don't seem like they're having any fun UNLESS they are nitpicking and bitching. Could you show them how to have fun actually playing the game, Santa?</p>
<p>7. Kewl d00dz. If you can't kill them, if you can't make their mothers put them to bed before I log in, could you send me a decoder ring and them some typing lessons? I'm really fucking tired of trying to figure out what the hell they're talking about when they mash keys at random and then they get all traumatized when I don't instantly respond to them.</p>
<p>8. My computer. I have 128 MB of RAM, a 32 MB Maxi Gamer Cougar video card, and an ISDN connection, and I still can't play video games as fast as my favorite games require.  What the hell do I need, a supercomputer? And I don't even like computers. I'd still be using an IBM clone from 1986 if I could. My current machine is a computer McNugget, I CAN'T update the damn thing anymore. So many areas of various games I play are so laggy as to be unplayable.</p>
<p>9. Quality Assurance. I want some. That is all.</p>
<p>10. Peace on earth, good will to men, women, and rant site writers. I figured I might as well throw that in here since I was already asking for the impossible.</p>
<p>Thanks, Santa. You the man. I'm leaving you a beer this year, and I hope that improves my faction with you. You've been glowering at me dubiously since I stopped believing, and it's kinda upsetting me.</p>
