<p>Two incidents:<br> 
  So I'm guiding, and some poor turkey steps through the ceiling in Hate. He can't return to the group, for those of you
  who don't know about that little feature. I go up and fish him out of the ceiling. While I'm there, another petition
  comes through from the Hate raiders. Someone died, and his body warped halfway across the zone. Since I was
  there, and can verify that he did in fact die with his group and not halfway across the zone, I know he's not cheating. I
  also know about that particular warp bug. His corpse is on the landing pad for those bug deaths.</p>
<p>So I'm playing, and I get a tell - can you come to Fear? A body warped across the zone, and the raiders up there
  don't have the juice to fetch it. The guide they contacted said, "I'm truly sorry, but I can only do certain things in the
  planes and that's not one of them." The raiders are contacting every 46+ they can see online, in hopes that someone
  will be willing to help. I'm too busy, and the nasty selfish part of me is glad, because I don't know the planes very
  well and it's a sure thing I would die and die often. I can't bind by the portal either - those deaths would mean lots of
  walking.</p>
<p>Why the fuck can't guides help? Here it is straight from the guide rulebook:</p>
<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><b style="font-size:14px;">5.6 Customer Service Limited Zones</b><br>
Some zones in EQ have been designed with extreme rewards and risks. Because of design and tuning issues,
  Customer Service intervention in these zones is restricted. </p>
<p><b style="font-size:14px;">5.6.1 List of Customer Service Limited Zones</b><br>
 Fear, Hate, Sky, Veeshan's Peak</p>
<p><b style="font-size:14px;">5.6.2 Acceptable CSRep Presence in Customer Service Limited Zones</b><br>
The presence of Customer Service Representatives in Customer Service Limited Zones creates two undesired
  situations. First, players are more likely to ask for assistance in gameplay issues from the CS staff if a CS Rep is in
  the zone. Second, players are more likely to blame CS Representatives for any inconvenience they may experience if
  a CS Rep is in the zone. For these reasons mentioned above CS Reps must not be in Customer Service Limited
  Zones except under the following conditions:
  <ul>
  <li>They are investigating a possible Exception Incident (Abuse, Disruption, or Exploitation) at the request of a player.</li>
  <li>They are investigating a possible bug at the request of a player for documentation purposes.</li>
  <li>They are removing a corpse from an object such as the ground, a wall, a tree, etc. according to Corpse Recovery
  Procedure (See 7.3 Corpse Recovery)</li>
  <li>They are unsticking a player stuck on the geometry (in an object, in a wall, etc). The player should be moved the
  minimum amount of distance necessary to unstick them from the geometry.</li>
  <li>They are summoning a corpse from a verified inaccessible area listed in 5.6.2.1 to a position of the player's choice
  within the zone.</li>
  <li> They are summoning a player from a verified inaccessible area listed in 5.6.2.1 in the Customer Service Limited
  Zone to a non-PvP area of Arena and then back to either the zone-in point of the Customer Service Limited Zone or
  to another player of the player's choice in the Customer Service Limited Zone.</li>
  <li>They are following Policy and Procedures concerning an Under the World Case. (See 7.13)</li>		  
   </p> 
<p><b style="font-size:14px;">5.6.2.1 Inaccessible Areas in Customer Service Limited Zones</b><br>
Currently the only verified inaccessible are in a CS Limited zone is caused through an anomaly that often occurs
  when a player has gone linkdead in the Plane of Hate. When this anomaly happens a player can become stuck in an
  inaccessible area of the second floor of the Plane of Hate. As mobs can also sometimes become stuck in the area,
  players can also die here. This area can be verified by using the /loc command. The z coordinate of this area is
  approximately 110.</p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>There you have it, boys and girls. By the rules, I can't even fish you out of the Hate ceiling unless you've gone
  linkdead. (Linkdead - as if you can't just step through it.) There are NO verifiable bugs in Fear, Sky, or VP, and
  besides the ceiling, nothing I can do in Hate. </p>
<p>Did you like the part about verifying a bug at the player's request? Forget that, the above comes from the August 7th
  edition, the second full policy manual to be released since I started guiding, and there have been no updates at all.</p>
<p>What in the FUCK were they thinking? Let's release a bunch of zones that are so crap ridden, so buggy, and so
  screwed in pathing that it makes people crazy. Let's make it one of the only outlets (pre-Kunark) for high level
  players. And just for shits and giggles, let's refuse to help anyone in there. And let's DISMISS any guide who helps
  anyway! YAY! What sort of ignorant nutlicker comes up with this bullshit?</p>
<p>I'm sick of taking it. I fetched the poor son of a bitch in scenario #1, in case you're wondering. What I want from you
  guys is a list of known bugs in the planes I can use. With some obvious exceptions LEAPING to the top of my mind,
  I don't think there are too many exploiting dewds posting here. (Oh, and by the way exception boy, please crawl
  back under your rock. I can't have been the only one noticing you killing guards in Freeport, you dumb fuck. The
  number of hours you play, you'd think you could level by just killing the usual shit. Lifeless loser. Go find a woman.)</p>
