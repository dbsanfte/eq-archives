<p>I come from a rather mixed background. New England Yankee farmer blood flows side by side with Russian Jew, passing by Native American in my veins, pumping past Mexican and French and Dutch. Proud landowners mix it up with bootleggers, and pillars of their communities mingle with what is delicately referred to in Appalachian circles as "hill trash." My ancestors have jack shit in common with each other, except for maybe a desire to kick each other's asses in a bar fight. And one other thing - on all sides, when a war broke out, they all served their nation in times of war. They defended their ideals and their communities with force. No one, in any of the forked and twisted brambles of my family tree, has ever waited to be drafted.</p>
<p>Look at the military. Don't think about the policy makers, the political machinations behind the campaigns, the presidential motivations that send people away from home with guns in hand. Look at the military itself, and the people who choose to serve their country. They do a job with more red tape and forms than the IRS, that pays less than what a plumber makes, that earns them less respect than your average gangbanger gets. They do their job twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. When the rest of us are eating Thanksgiving dinner, or shooting bottle rockets at each other in July, or recovering from nasty hangovers on New Year's day, there's some kid holding his gun on guard duty, or taking his turn on watch, or even sitting in some squalid Arlington, Virginia cubicle processing paperwork for a new AEGIS destroyer. And I say kid, because throughout history most of the armed forces are made up of the same people in the gamer demographic. People our age have fought the wars in the past century, and I daresay wars in general.</p>
<p>Nobody has to put themselves in harm's way. Even when there's a draft, you can always leave the country, or serve in a non-combat capacity. No one joins the military so they can go off to die. They join for money, for travel, for excitement, for job skills, for security, for family tradition, or even sometimes a sense of duty. The hazard to this job is that occasionally other people try to kill you. And sometimes, people die.</p>
<p>Sometimes people die in wars with clearly defined causes, and the folks back home salute the fallen, and chisel their names onto statues and say, "This person died saving the world from the Nazis" or "This person died defending democracy" or "This person died defending his homeland." Sometimes people die in wars that don't make a lot of sense, and they don't get statues until long afterwards. They get dismissed as fools for serving a country that shouldn't have sent them off to die. They are mocked for their naiveté, for keeping their oaths to serve a nation that doesn't even know what it wants. Patriotism, duty, obligation, honor, these are the vestigial remnants of a backwards age, right? Why die for something so meaningless as oil, or pineapples, or cocaine, or worthless land no one actually wants the trouble of governing?</p>
<p>Sometimes the people who claim to be public servants, with their inflated salaries and egos, decide that their interests are important enough to be defended with the blood of soldiers. They choose to send invading forces, because the people of some country or another democratically elect a socialist. Sometimes the people with nothing more to their name but an inbred pedigree and a reserved parking space at National Airport stand up and declare that American soldiers should be willing to die for whatever strikes a chord with voters in an election year. American people (being as a general rule ill-informed boobs more concerned with their dicks and their checkbooks than with global politics) tend to vilify the soldier when they discover the uselessness of certain wars. Never the person who sent them to die, always the person who actually took the risk.</p>
<p>Out of all the blame and second-guessing, the fallen serviceman gets one single day. Monday is Memorial Day, a day to remember those who died in service of their country. How do we commemorate this day? We drink beer, we buy cars, and we sit in traffic heading for the beach. We listen to the same stupid mattress sale ad over and over until we swear by all that's holy that we will sleep on cactus spines before we ever buy a mattress from that screaming idiot.</p>
<p>You know something? It's more than a goddamn mattress sale. People our age went out and died because they believed that whether the United States was right, wrong, or merely misguided, it was still worth defending and dying for. If we don't spare so much as a minute from our precious three-day weekend to think about the people who gave their lives so that the world could be a better place, maybe we don't deserve that kind of sacrifice.</p>
<p>At 3:00 PM on Monday, <a href="http://www.remember.gov">please stop for sixty seconds</a> and offer a salute in your heart to those who died for their country. Spare a thought for the people out there right now doing a job you and I don't ever want to do ourselves. Go ahead and have a beer, but first offer up a toast to the people who gave everything they had so that you wouldn't have to have a care in the world while you drink it. Remember that there are ideals worth dying for, and that there are people who have done so.</p>
