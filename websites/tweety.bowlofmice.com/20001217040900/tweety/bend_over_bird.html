<p>So, at this time my account has been banned. Just in case anyone thinks I'm always as psychotic as I am when I rant, please feel free to read the following emails. I had hoped I would not need to post these. It is my feeling, however, that rolling over and taking it without any lubrication is not acceptable.</p>

<a href="/tweety/1_and_2.html">Email #1 and #2</a><br>

<p>Many of you have written with your support, and I thank you. Two of you have written with obvious personal problems, for which I also say thank you, because my trash file was hungry. (By the way, precisely what do my tits have to do with my ability to make a reasoned argument? You were a bottle baby, I can tell. Love ya, mean it!) My strongest thanks go to the small handful of people who wrote with logic and reason, to criticize my actions. Anything that can force someone as hard headed as I am to step back and think is pretty good stuff.</p>
<p>Let me say this - I have never stated that my removal from the guide program was anyone's fault but mine. The original, anonymous rant got linked, posted, printed out, and scribbled on bathroom walls at AOL. All I can say in my own defense is it was intended for a small audience, and I was tired and angry at the time that I wrote it. My personal friends among my fellow guide team members had quit long ago. In a fit of temper, I complained to a group of people I've "known" for nearly a year. It was my error in judgment, and mine alone. As for this website... the initial set up was a gift from a friend, and I, as an aspiring writer, was flattered that so many would want to read some half assed commentary. A further error in judgment, I concede. For this, I should be crucified? I was not caught exploiting, or being abusive. Several ex-guides have written me to say their final act as a guide was to summon and "kill" a particularly obnoxious player. My last act as a guide was to rezz someone who fell for 10K. My account is banned, and they still play? Excuse me? The only difference I see is that I publicly stated my loathing of kewl d00dz and senseless rules.</p>
<p>For this, I have lost an account that I put a year's worth of work into. My /played time was absolutely obscene. (Oh, by the way, my home does not have "cat ass syndrome." I'm a reasonably productive member of society. Y'all don't get updates on a regular basis because I leave the computer on a regular basis.) For this I lost contact with a community of friends. Yes, yes, I can go buy the game again. So, quick poll, raise your hands if you feel like redoing a 48th level character from scratch? Thought so. Also, if they don't give me my account back, why on earth would I want to give them more money? Finally, I am not the only person being affected here. My roommate's credit card paid for several accounts. Is he to be banned as well, for the simple act of living with me? What about the three other accounts who have the same IP address as I do? As for those of you whining that if I hate the game so much, I shouldn't play - I don't hate the game. I thought that was clear. I ENJOY the game. I hate a minority of players. A LOT.</p>
<p>Verant does not allow me to rant on the private, password-protected guide site. I have no relationship with the people "above" me in the chain of command. The guide liason, who works for Verant, has a long, documented track record of not wanting to hear anything that isn't enthusiastic about the program. The seniors are instructed to hear you out and tell you to consider leaving if you have negative feelings.</p>
<p>Here's the reason I think you folks should be concerned. It is a very small step from banning an account (because the player turned out to be an "unfit" guide) to the next level (banning an account due to criticism of some aspect of the game). As it is, the rules have been adjusted to state that ranting on Whineplay can get you banned. There is NO process by which a player banned in this fashion can appeal, besides ranting and screaming. If there is one, it is not publicly known. If history serves as any example, I can only play the game again if a statistically significant number of players express their displeasure with Verant on my behalf. I see this as unlikely, since the plain fact is most people are too busy to do so. There's a petition on Whineplay right now, if it hasn't already scrolled off the bottom of the page.</p>
<p>Any and every currently active guide who still wishes to play needs to take note of my example. You should just quit, if you ever have so much as a mood where you're unhappy enough to post. Regular players should take note and NEVER post any identifying information that can attract notice.</p>
<p>This whole thing, I think, was a response from the gods, over my "Wrongfully Banned" rant. It seems that you can in fact be banned for anonymous ranting.</p>
