<p>Some of my best friends are roleplayers, but I wouldn't want my daughter to marry one.</p>
<p>I play on a carebear server primarily. With the game being so loot-centric, and plat
    being one of the ways you acquire loot, I can't justify losing any of it (and thus the fruits
    of millions of camping hours) to the plain fact that I suck at PVP. But, being the
    bloodthirsty kill crazy bitch that I am, I have a character on the coin-loot only server,
    Tallon Zek. I'm here to tell you peasants sending yearning glances at the PVP server,
    The Carebear Crew does not have a lock on fucking morons and masturbatory
    behavior.</p>
<p>It's WORSE on a PVP server, actually. All the Quake refugees with basic reading
    ability realized right off they belonged in a PVP world as opposed to PVE, so there's a
    tremendous amount of "blow shit up" testosterone floating around. I can tolerate those
    guys. I expect to find them in a PVP world. What I cannot fucking stand are the roleplay
    police.</p>
<p>Anyone ever belong to the Society for Creative Anachronism? These guys make their
    own armor and beat each other silly in organized combat. Around that basic core has
    grown an active group of artisans and other folks that like to dress up in medieval
    clothes, eat with their fingers, quaff ("like drinking, only messier") period booze, and do
    really amazing things with illumination and needlework. Anyway, two types of people
    join the SCA - the fun people and the period police. Fun people make a tunic, cape,
    and put on the knee high moccasins and start quaffing. The period police get in fun
    people's faces and demand, with a superior smirk, to know precisely what decade
    THAT monstrosity of a costume came from. Most members, being human, fall between
    the two extremes.</p>
<p>Roleplayers also fit those two descriptions. You got your "Hail fellow, well met! Care to
    slaughter some light races with my band? Toss me a sow, please" guys, and then you
    have the turkeys who respond with "Sow? I know not what this "sow" is. If thou
    meanest thy wish is for a casting of a Spirit of the Wolf, thou must request this in
    language I comprehend, thou villain." UM. Does anyone else meet these bozos and
    think, fuck if I'd ever take this dipshit on a plane raid? What are they going to type, "My
    Lord Cazic-Thule appears to be approaching yonder! Pray cast thy mystic portal and
    remove us from" *SPLAT*</p>
<p>I don't mind a little roleplay, it spices things up. What I loathe are the cretins who try to
    inflict their worldview on everyone else. Like the warrior who wandered up to my little
    Teir'Dal cleric and demanded healing "for that 'tis thy duty." Excuse me? Does turning on
    your roleplay flag turn off your brain? I'm a DARK ELF CLERIC. I serve the GOD OF
    HATE. I chose this class because I DON'T LIKE PEOPLE (well, and for the emotional
    satisfaction of crushing halflings and gnomes). I heal people (outside my group) because
    they might GIVE ME STUFF.</p>
<p>There are limits to RPing, too. Because you chose an evil race doesn't give you a license
    to be an asshole. Training, slumming, and repeated KSing don't make you a better dark
    elf, troll, ogre, whatever. If you were really roleplaying anything besides a psychopathic
    murderer, you wouldn't be in the equivalent of the grade school sandbox taking
    someone's toy rat. Are you really so pathetic and ignorant that the only application you
    can think of for evil is to be the neighborhood bully? That isn't evil. That's indicative of
    weakness and a very small nutsack. Go reread some Dragonlance and check out Kitiara
    and Raistlin (but for chrissake don't give your character those names, everyone else
    thinks you're either pretentious or stupid). And before I get deluged with mail saying "but
    I AM roleplaying a psychopathic murderer" - no, you aren't. Even pyschopaths have
    certain patterns, obsessions, and goals. All you're doing is ripping the wings off flies and
    pissing in the drinking fountain.</p>
<p>This is technically a roleplaying game. It means Pokemon, the recent Survivor episode,
    and the size of your real life dick are things best left in /tell or /guildsay. Everyone needs
    to pretend like there's a world to interact with. But listen up, roleplay police: Go back in
    memory to your D&D days, and think about how your best friend would have decked
    you if you spent seven hours in character, eventually saying shit like "Pizza Hut? I know
    not where this domicile is found, verily, I know only of the hermit's hut." This is not your
    own personal universe, and you'll just have to cope.</p>
