<br>
I have a problem with my character that needs to be addressed.  Let me explain the situation.  Samerrin was one of my first characters.  She was created well over a year ago, and at that time, I did not know that wis = mana.  I had not read all the character creation info available....and I made her wrong...Really wrong.  Just going by what Verant says is most important stats for a cleric (those in yellow at creation) str, sta and wis, I divided up my points.  Sam's base str is 90, her base sta is 90 and her base wis is 90.  Yes 90.<br>
<br>
I did not discover my error til much much later, and by that time I had leveled up into my 30s.  At that point it didnt seem as though the wis deficit would be insurmountable and was not presenting much of a problem, so I kept playing her.<br>
<br>
However, by the time I hit my 40s the wis deficit was starting to be noticable.  While other clerics my level were able to start trading out wis items for ac/other stats, I was still struggling to get my wis up to 200. This is an ongoing battle.<br>
<br>
My gear does not suck.  I am not saying that it does.  But I dont have any really nice wis items, none that would get my wis to an acceptable point for my level.  Sam's current wis is 170.  And short of planes gear, velious quest gear, and guardian legs....ge boots...sebilis scale...I have no idea how to get her wis up any higher.<br>
<br>
I am not rich.  With 170 wis, I feel like I am a liability in an Old Seb group or any of the other tough 50+ dungeons.  So, I am stuck.  I cannot afford to buy the sebilis scale bp, seb scale legs, froglock scale bp, ge boots.  And I have had hellishly poor luck winning the roll on guardian legs, and EM legs (which I have only seen drop once in 5 trips to Hate).<br>
<br>
Right now I have no wis on my bp, legs, boots.  I have a nice shield I cant use cuz I cant forfeit the 5 wis I'd have to give up to use it.<br>
<br>
So what I'm asking is...can you guys help me out?  Some ge boots would help my cause greatly.  Do you think we could raid Efreeti again some time soon? I know I am not the only one that needs ge boots still.  I know we have been in Skyshrine a lot lately, and quite frankly...I am getting frustrated.  I have seen guardian legs drop very very rarely....only twice when I've been on, but I know we have several guildies that have them.  And I have logged a LOT of hours in SS.  <br>
<br>
Btw: I am wearing 8 wis veil and 7 wis rings already.  7 wis on shoulders, 4 wis on back, 5 wis on head, 3 wis 20 mana on neck, 4 wis on hands, and 5 wis on each wrist.....I think that covers it.  <br>
<br>
If anyone has any ideas on other places where we as a guild might possibly be able to attain some better wis stuff for me and other wis casters, please help me get a raid organized for it.  <br>
<br>
Please please help....I dont wanna shelve Sam, but 170 wis at lvl 54 is laughable (and incredibly embarrasing for me)...and I am losing my motivation to continue to try to get the wis items I need....its just damn hard.<br>
<br>
Thanks, Sam <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#110d03><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub33.ezboard.com/uyvonnspiritwalker.showPublicProfile?language=EN>YvonnSpiritWalker</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 28<br> <font color=#cc9933>(6/13/01 11:31:32 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: I Need Help Please</span><hr size=1> Hey Sam, sorry to hear about your prob there...I also did the same thing with Yvoon...she used to be Yvonne :P but at level 19 I was with Donatello, Demeni and Jal when we where in the Sanguine and they convinced me to start her over, so I did..but I take it at 54 the last thing you want to hear is to start over, but it may be a thought, I have a char that is level 1 cleric that I have not played yet and a rogue level 14, I know Sakko has a low level as well..so it may be fun to start over..however..I would do what I can to help!!!<br>

There is a totem that drops in Dagnors Cauldron, the Pearl Kedge Totem.  It has +18 wis, but at a cost of -9 str.  Not a bad trade off if you put some points into str that you should have put in wis upon character creation.  Here's a link to this item at Allakhazams.  <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://eqdb.allakhazam.com/item.html?item=2318">Pearl Kedge Totem</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->  I think it is a fairly rare spawn that drops it, and according to the site is a very rare item.  It is dropped by a lvl 30 mob, and Dagnors Cauldron is listed as a 15-25 zone, so maybe we can have a raid for the lower level characters, and the higher level characters who are in need of this item can come by to assist them.  Also, here is the chart from EQCasters Realm for jewelry.  <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/misc/jewellery/jewel_table.asp">Jewelcraft Chart</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->  Maybe you can look it over and find a point or two of wis through buying some jewelry.  I know Ysall has VERY reasonable prices for guildies, and if you need some pp for jewelry, I'm sure someone would loan it to you, as it is for the good of the guild that you have as high a wis as you can.  Of course, there is no substitute for raiding to get the best you can get.  Here is a list of cleric items from EQCasters Realm, maybe you can find something that is a dropped item, and let the guild know.  I am sure we can get some peeps together to help you get a few dropped items if need be.  <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/data/items.asp?Action=ClassSelect&amp;ClassSelect=Cleric">Cleric Items</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->  Send me a tell in game if you need any help, and I will do my best to assist you =)<br>

I have enough wis gear to put any normal druid over 200 wis. However, Panidwen was created nearly 2 years ago and was my first character. His base wisdom is 75 points. Depending on which items I have mounted I can get roughly 160 wisdom. <br>
It still is possible to get 200 wis it just is a little more expensive. GEB's are a good place to start and some of the velious stuff has some good wis as well. <br>

But he fares well, and he has always upgraded to better stuff as he hunted in some spots, he never stopped to go camp lower lvl stuff to get stats...and he still got to lvl 58...not saying this to push you 'round sam..as i said i have 90 base wis too, im at 165 wis unbuffed, and just yesterday, i got laughed at by another of my best friends who jes twinked his shaman oge(less than 90 wis base) to about 178...its all about getting those points...<br>
<br>
You didnt mention anything for range, so i'd suggest at least a medicine totem..5 ac 5 wis, is an hella easy camp for a guild such as us, and is situated in FM...<br>
<br>
For legs, even if a bit low end for you, try to get gatorscale legs, its still 7 ac 4 wis(i think..).  Other than that just like i said..try your luck in seb...i'm sure you wouldnt regret it...it would take a few to get the items tho, as randoms can be a bitch...<br>
<br>
Anyhow i need GEBs too, thought my sow boots would be better, but they are only 3 wis...could use the 6 pts boost..so if you guys do mount an efreeti raid, count on me for being there ;P<br>

<br>
OK, so summary:<br>
<br>
FM: do the cycle for the medicine totem..??...I have heard about it, and I really know very little on how to get the mob that drops it to spawn, but I will do some checking.  This sounds like a lot of fun.  And a decent range item would certainly help.<br>
<br>
SolB: Efreeti.  Anytime guys.....I'm up for it =)<br>
<br>
Dagnor's: PKT.  I'll do some checking on this...If I remember right, its a rare drop off a rare spawn, so not sure if this would be something we want to mess with guildwide or not.  Probably be a very long, very boring camp, but I will also do some checking on that too.<br>
<br>
Thank you so much for the information....Will do a post soon with more specifics on these areas...Lets get some wis gear for our wis casters!<br>

So i never really have a stat at a constant number or try to max out any one stat, but try to make my gear fit for different situations.<br>

Having 200+ wis is nice i guess but its at the expense of AC which is darn important for us ( for such things as complete heal or AoE heal where it aggros everything ) Im pretty darn happy with having 188 wisdom and higher AC. <br>
1 wisdom alone doesnt actually add as much as you may think.....1 wis = approx 10 mana (APPROX) <br>
<br>
so if you think that maybe an extra 10 wis = maybe approx 110 mana....hell you can get +50 mana on some items <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

SO maybe you should think about items that have +mana also.<br>

<br>
As far as GEB's go I'm all in. Last time I checked Calissandrya still needs her's to.<br>
<br>
Also would appreciate any help I could get obtaining a Shrowd of Nature, Need to get rid of this foreman's tunic I've had since 15. :-P<br>

Pandiwen also needs the same upgrade.<br>
<br>
Whenever you see me on just gimme a holler. I'll be glad to help.<br>

So I guess I'm putting in 4cp..hehe<br>
<br>
From the looks of things, a lot of the Relmer's have rounded stats on their characters, and amazingly enough this seems the way to go.<br>
<br>
I've seen the Relm do things at lower levels and with less people than some of the other so called UBER-Guilds do.<br>
<br>
We have some of the best players I have ever seen. We have Clerics that can tank mobs, how often do you see that !! <br>

What I'm getting at is, I don't think fretting over stats is that important. We need to concentrate on keeping the excellent leadership and originality this guild has and the gear will come. )))<br>

We are able to do these things because we have a mutual desire to make the RoN a force to be reckoned with.  Ownage isnt everything in EQ, sometimes it is better to take your time and develop strong friendships here.  One thing that helps us is we have so many friends that are used to each others playing styles.  Take Cali and I for instance.  When she and I are grouped, i dont watch my life bar, i just focus on the mob.....I know that I wont die, unless it is a catastrophic breakdown, and we all die.  Therefore, without worrying about my life, I can fight the mob fearlessly, and with 100 percent concentration.  I'm sure that there are other people in our guild that are the same way with someone.  That is what makes us strong.  Trust and friendship make us strong.   Just some food for thought.  Remember that RoN is a family, and treat all members as such.  Without that, we'll all die too easily.  See you in game, family. <p><BR>

I awoke one morning from a fitful sleep.  It was then that I realized the true meaning of life.  Life is a series of obstacles, and the only question that remains is this.....are you willing to take the challenge and overcome these obstacles?</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub33.ezboard.com/uprincessrazz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>PrincessRazz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Zeros</span><br>  Posts: 117<br> <font color=#cc9933>(6/17/01 3:31:03 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: I Need Help Please</span><hr size=1> Well wisdom for a cleric is very important, now that i have my wisdom over 200 i see a big differnce in how fast i med and how ofton i go OOM. Mana items really only take effect after you get your wisdom to 200. And having this will save a life. The Pearl Kedge Totum is cool but can only go in main slot and is very rare, i am all for helping out on that camp. And camping gebs as well. Just let me know. And when  you get your wisdom to 200+ its not to hard working on your ac, and a lot of our cleric stuff comes with pretty good ac. So just let me know if you need help.<br>

This weekend coming up we've got PoS,  PoH,  etc etc,   so it doesnt sound like the best time to oWnZ fREeTi,  but any time next week,  or the next weekend,  im all for a fREeTi extraviganza.   <br>
<br>
A couple of you may not know..... but GEBs arent lore ^_^  Which means that one group could sit there even if they all have em, and keep pharming.  <br>
<br>
And after looking at the turnout for IWK and SS every night (SS not even having been a Zone of the Week),  what would everyone say to clearing FG's a couple times if SolB became zone of the week.   If you are unfamiliar with the loot from FG's,  you should really check it out.    Even tho its old skool,  the hybrid version of Tobrin's eyepatch drops for thier neck slot (polished mithril torque 7ac 13wis 13int),  which i would die for.   Tranix crown drops which is a killer monk or enchy item  (0.1 weight,   13ac 15char 20MR effect serpant sight,  head slot)   We have Mithril Arms,  Mithril legs,   and some caster items drops off of the Fire Giant Magus that i dont know about,  and is supposed to be quite uber.    The list goes on,  the exp is great (which is why Razz can quite often be found here),   and we can finally have a zone of the week where nobody disagree's that there is something for absolutely everyone.<br>
<br>
If freeti boots drop as often as the FBSS (and it bet its more often since the boots are the common drop),  and RoN ownzed that camp for an entire week,  we'd get <b>everyone</b> a pair of boots =)  Not just the casters, mind you.  The tanks would have a pair too for selling or whatever they want.<br>
<br>
Something that would make this 10x easier:   A level 55+ mage.  Fighting TO freeti takes two groups,   fighting AT freeti takes one group.  If we could CotH people down to Freeti,  it would make things a lot simpler than fighting back there every time someone has to leave.   Two classes we are really short of in RoN is mages and wizzies (wizzies to TL the poor unfortunate tanks out)   Everyone should keep an eye out for these classes (especially higher level ones) who arent guilded,  or who are unhappy with thier guild.  (and are RoN pedigree)  I think we have two 50+ wizzies, and two 50+ mages.  <br>
<br>
Just some idea's.   If any of my info is wrong,  ill tell you now that im a SolB newbie.  Ive been there twice for Naggie, and didnt really stop to look where i was going,... jez followed everyone else.   Ive never done Freeti,  but if SS and IWK are any indication,  i shouldnt have too hard a time getting it right. <p>-Asti Spumate, Baby.</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub33.ezboard.com/umoongaden.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Moongaden</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0> at: 6/22/01 8:49:03 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub33.ezboard.com/uvladatoth.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vladatoth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 68<br> <font color=#cc9933>(6/19/01 12:54:08 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: I'll throw something out there</span><hr size=1> Efreeti can be taken with one good group.

Things didnt go well for RoN to start off with.... Vlad's Hate raid didnt go well due to no fault of his own.  He lost the roll on the cleric bp.  Spirits in Sky were good even though some of us remember smoother happenings up there.  Only made it to 3rd isle.  I lived through tanking a Gorgalisk, and i copied down each and every hit to find out how much damage i took.... 8885 damage exactly =)   Any warrior can outdo me,  but thats the second most damage ive taken from a planar mob.  (1st was CT doing 14k hp worth of damage before i died)<br>
<br>
So eventaully we all jumped off the island and Sam and i got together in Freeport and she asked me what i wanted to do.  Welllllll.... i told her i wanted to get her some Golden Ifreeti Boots.  She didnt argue much =) <br>
<br>
So off to SolB we went, and luckily Freeti wasnt camped.  Eventually enough RoN came (Linweilu,  Snaydar, Donatellos, Demeni,  Capo,  Kaytlin) and we headed over to Freeti.   I must say,  Snaydar did (as always) an amazing job at Nchi stuff, and kept us all alive.   And we got to Freeti.  PH was up, but that was kewl,  we took the room easily.  First spawn after that... Freeti pops, and GEBs drop.  Bang, Sam has her boots.  WOOT!!~ Samerrin!!!<br>
<br>
But did RoN stop there?  Oh no... oh no.    Next spawn,  Freeti again!  Woot!  Ring drops,  Donatellos gets.  Woot Doni!!  RoN oWnZ fREeTi.... but did we stop there?  Oh no,  oh no.<br>
<br>
Third spawn.   Freeti again!!!!!!!!!!!  GEBs drop.   Demeni wins the random.  WOOT!!~ Demeni.  Did RoN stop there?  Oh no, oh no.<br>
<br>
Two PH's later,  Freeti pops.  We're beside ourselves.  GEBs drop,  Kayt gets.  WOOT!!~ Kaytlin!!!!!   But did RoN stop there?  Oh no... oh no...<br>
<br>
Two more PHs go by, and we're joined by 4 more RoN members.  Kuros,  Racklin (sp?),  Juzu's 00ber warrior twink, and Corpuss.... and oh is Corpuss glad he came...<br>
<br>
Freeti spawns, GEBs drop,  Corpuss gets.  WOOT!!~ Corpuss.  WOOT!!~ RoN!!!!!   4 GEBs, and a Ring!!!!!<br>
<br>
Gratz all on great loot, and great times.  I had a blast.   Hopefully a lot of you will get a chance to read this, cause we're going back tomorrow night.  Mialee is in desperate need of new booties, as well as numerous other RoN members.  YOU are encouraged to come =)    And if all the casters have thier booties,  and you arent a caster,  you get to roll on em =)  <br>
<br>
See yas all tomorrow night at 8pm est =)  /pray camp not taken <p>-Asti Spumate, Baby.</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub33.ezboard.com/umoongaden.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Moongaden</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0> at: 6/24/01 12:07:49 am<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub33.ezboard.com/fdenofiniquityfrm1.showMessage?topicID=130.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub33.ezboard.com/fdenofiniquityfrm1.showMessage?topicID=131.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub33.ezboard.com/fdenofiniquityfrm1.emailToFriend?topicID=134.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub33.ezboard.com/fdenofiniquityfrm1.threadControl?topicID=134.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/sunset/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub33.ezboard.com/fdenofiniquityfrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=134.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub33.ezboard.com/fdenofiniquityfrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=134.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub33.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="denofiniquityfrm1">Stuff<option value="denofiniquityfrm2">Event Stuff<option value="denofiniquityfrm9">Board of Trade<option value="denofiniquityfrm3">Frying Pan<option value="denofiniquityfrm8">Write Only<option value="denofiniquityfrm6">O-Zone<option value="denofiniquityfrm7">Members Only</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#cc9933>- </font><a href=http://pub33.ezboard.com/bdenofiniquity>Den of Iniquity</a><font color=#cc9933> - </font><a href=http://pub33.ezboard.com/fdenofiniquityfrm1>Stuff</a> <font color=#cc9933> - </font><a href="http://relmofnine.freeservers.com/">Home</a><font color=#cc9933> - </font> <P></P>
