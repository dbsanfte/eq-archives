A woman was lying in her hospital bed recuperating after an intense<br>
12 hour delivery of a bouncing baby boy.<br>
<br>
Moments later the hospital room door opened, and in walked<br>
the delivery nurse carrying the baby boy ....<br>
<br>
SUDDENLY the nurse THROWS the baby on the floor, kicks it up<br>
against the wall, picks it up and TWIRLS it around several times<br>
and THROWS it against the wall....<br>
<br>
Well, just bewildered, the woman gives out a loud SHREEEK and<br>
hollers MY GOD ..... WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO MY BABY ??????<br>
<br>
The Nurse chuckles a little to herself 'April Fools', she says...<br>
He was ALREADY DEAD !!!!!!!!!!<br>

with a sad voice I am sorry, but your baby is stillborn.<br>

MAD with sorrow the mother THROWS the baby on the floor, kicks it up<br>
against the wall, picks it up and TWIRLS it around several times<br>

Jerry Rice is walking down the streets of San Francisco when all of a<br>
sudden he hears sirens coming from the next street down.  He hurries<br>
down the road to see what's happening and sees a huge fire engulfing<br>
a 10 story building.  And on the top floor, a lady is leaning out the<br>
window shouting to the firemen below.<br>
<br>
FIREMAN:  Come on, lady, jump.  We have the tarp here, we'll be able<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   to catch you.<br>
LADY:     No....I can't.  My baby, my baby is up here.<br>
FIREMAN:  Throw the baby down, we'll catch him.<br>
LADY:     No, you'll miss.  I can't leave my baby.<br>
<br>
Jerry sees this and steps forward.  &quot;Hey, I think I can help.  Let me<br>
have the bullhorn.&quot;<br>
<br>
JERRY:    Hey lady, I'm Jerry Rice, the wide receiver for the San Francisco<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   49er's.  I'm the best wide receiver in the game, throw your baby<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   down and I'll catch him, this is what I do for a living.<br>
<br>
Being a 49er fan herself, the lady recognizes Jerry and throws her baby<br>
down to him.  Just as she throws it though, a huge gust of wind comes<br>
and takes the baby and starts to blow him off course.  Jerry sees this<br>
and takes off after the baby.  He hurdles the line closing off the area,<br>
fights through the crowd, dodges a couple of fire fighters, jumps over<br>
the car,  and dives forward, just making a fingertip catch of the baby.<br>
The crowd around him goes wild and starts cheering his amazing catch.<br>
So Jerry jumps to his feet, raises his finger into the air, does a two<br>
step and then spikes the baby.<br>
