<br>
Women love to shop. It is the one area of the world where <br>
they feel like they're actually in control. <br>
 <br>
Women especially love a bargain. The question of 'need' is <br>
irrelevant; so don't bother pointing  it out. Anything on <br>
sale is fair game. <br>
 <br>
Women never have anything to wear. Don't question the racks <br>
of clothes in the closet; you 'just don't understand'. <br>
 <br>
Women need to cry. And they won't do it alone unless they <br>
know you can hear them. <br>
 <br>
Women will always ask questions that have no right answer, in <br>
an effort to trap you into feeling guilty.  <br>
 <br>
Women love to talk. Silence intimidates them and they feel a <br>
need to fill it, even if they have nothing to say. <br>
 <br>
Women need to feel like there are people worse off than they <br>
are. That's why soap operas and Oprah Winfrey-type shows are <br>
so successful. <br>
 <br>
Women hate bugs. Even the strong-willed ones need a man <br>
around when there's a spider or a wasp involved. <br>
 <br>
Women can't keep secrets. They eat away at them from the <br>
inside. And they don't view it as being untrustworthy, <br>
providing they only tell two or three people. <br>
 <br>
Women always go to public restrooms in groups. It gives them <br>
a chance to gossip. <br>
 <br>
Women can't refuse to answer a ringing phone, no matter what <br>
she's doing. It might be the lottery calling. <br>
 <br>
Women never understand why men love toys. Men understand that <br>
they wouldn't need toys if women had an 'on/off' switch. <br>
 <br>
Women think all beer is the same. <br>
<br>
Women keep three different shampoos and two different <br>
conditioners in the shower. After a woman showers, the <br>
bathroom will smell like a tropical rain forest. <br>
 <br>
Women don't understand the appeal of sports. Men seek <br>
entertainment that allows them to escape reality. Women seek <br>
entertainment that reminds them of how horrible things could <br>
be.  <br>
 <br>
If a man goes on a seven-day trip, he'll pack five days worth <br>
of clothes and will wear some things twice; if a woman goes <br>
on a seven-day trip she'll pack 21 outfits because she <br>
doesn't know what she'll feel like wearing each day. <br>
 <br>
Women brush their hair before bed. <br>
 <br>
Women are paid less than men, except for one  <br>
field: Modeling. <br>
 <br>
Women are never wrong. Apologizing is the man's <br>
responsibility, 'It's there in the Bible'. Hmmm, who was it <br>
that gave Adam the apple? <br>
 <br>
Women do not know anything about cars. 'Oil-stick, oil <br>
doesn't stick?' <br>
 <br>
Women have better restrooms. They get the nice chairs and red <br>
carpet. Men just get a large bowl to share.  <br>
 <br>
The average number of items in a typical woman's bathroom is <br>
437. A man would not be able to identify most of these items. <br>
 <br>
Women love cats. Men say they love cats, but when women <br>
aren't looking, men kick cats. <br>
<br>
********************************************<br>
Things You Should Know About Women Part II:<br>
<br>
Women love to talk on the phone. A woman can  <br>
visit her girlfriend for two weeks, and upon  <br>
returning home, she will call the same friend and  <br>
they will talk for three hours. <br>
 <br>
A woman will dress up to go shopping, water  <br>
the plants, empty the garbage, answer the phone,  <br>
read a book, or get the mail.  <br>
 <br>
Women will drive miles out of their way to  <br>
avoid the possibility of getting lost using a  <br>
shortcut. <br>
 <br>
Women do NOT want an honest answer to the  <br>
question, 'How do I look?' <br>
 <br>
PMS stands for: Permissible Man-Slaughter<br>
(or at least men think it means that). PMS also  <br>
stands for Preposterous Mood Swings and Punish My  <br>
Spouse. <br>
 <br>
The first naked man a woman sees is 'Ken'. <br>
 <br>
Women will make three right-hand turns to  <br>
avoid making one left-hand turn.  <br>
 <br>
'Oh, nothing,' has an entirely different  <br>
meaning in woman-language than it does in man- <br>
language. <br>
 <br>
Lewis Carroll's Caterpillar had nothing on  <br>
women. <br>
 <br>
Women cannot use a map without turning the map  <br>
to correspond to the direction that they are  <br>
heading. <br>
 <br>
All women are overweight by definition; don't  <br>
agree with them about it. Women always have 5  <br>
pounds to lose, but don't bring this up unless  <br>
they really have 5 pounds to gain. <br>
 <br>
If it is not Valentine's Day and you see a man  <br>
in a flower shop, you can probably start up a  <br>
conversation by asking, 'What did you do?' <br>
 <br>
Only women understand the reason for 'guest  <br>
towels' and the 'good china'. <br>
 <br>
Women want equal rights, but you rarely hear  <br>
them clamoring to be let into the draft to cover  <br>
the responsibilities that go with those rights.  <br>
All women seek equality with men until it comes to  <br>
sharing the closet, taking out the trash, and  <br>
picking up the check. <br>
 <br>
If a man ticks off a woman she will often  <br>
respond by getting a fuzzy toilet cover which  <br>
warms their rear, but makes it impossible for the  <br>
lid to stay up thus it constantly gets peed on by  <br>
the guys (which gets them in More trouble). <br>
 <br>
Women never check to see if the lid is up.  <br>
They seem to prefer taking a flying butt leap  <br>
towards the bowl and then chewing men out because  <br>
they 'left the seat up' instead of taking two  <br>
seconds and lowering it themselves. <br>
 <br>
Women can get out of speeding tickets by  <br>
pouting. This will get men arrested. <br>
 <br>
Women don't really care about a sense of humor  <br>
in a guy despite claims to the contrary. You don't  <br>
see women trampling over Tom Cruise to get to  <br>
Gilbert Gottfried, do you? <br>
 <br>
It's okay for women to dance with each other, but<br>
you don't see men dancing together. <br>
 <br>
Women will spend hours dressing up to go out,  <br>
and then they'll go out and spend more time  <br>
checking out other women. Men can never catch  <br>
women checking out other men; women will always  <br>
catch men checking out other women. <br>
 <br>
The most embarrassing thing for women is to  <br>
find another woman wearing the same dress at a  <br>
formal party. You don't hear men say, 'Oh-my GOD, there's <br>
another man wearing a black tux, get me outta here!'<br>
