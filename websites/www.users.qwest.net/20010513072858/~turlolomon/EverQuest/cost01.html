</B></FONT><P>The magic of numbers. Isn't this what Cost Analysis is all about? Finally, I found a game where I can put my Accounting degree to some use. It's about time too...I haven't used it for years. Now, let's break down the magic behind my spreadsheet. First, we need to know the cost of the raw components utilized in the recipe. If something is not used up during the process, I do not add it in. However, if an item is only used on successful completion...well, I have only found one recipe so far that does that, and I am still working on crunching that into my calculations. Ok, so, for the cost of raw materials, here is the basic formula.</P>
<FONT COLOR="#ffffff"><P>X + Y = Z</P>
</FONT><P>It's that easy! So, if one item costs 1 gp, and the second costs 1 sp, then the total cost of the item would be 1 gp 1 sp. This should not be the case though. What about the chance of failure. Some people believe failure should be sucked up by the tradesman. I disagree. That is not how real business works. Sure, they have over head and such, paying for employees, etc. But in EverQuest, we can't charge per hour (well, we could, but how do you document it?) so the failure rate is critical for this calculation. Besides, in RL, they do add that to the price as well. Now, what is the formula? After endless hours of repetitive work and research, I believe I have cracked it.  Browsing through the various websites, I came across the following from the official board.</P>
<FONT COLOR="#ffff00"><P>Q: How do spell fizzles (and missed notes on songs) work? </P>
<P>A: When you cast a spell, we call a fizzle check. There is always a 5% chance of succeeding (regardless of how low your appropriate skill is) and a 5% chance of failure (regardless of how high your appropriate skill is). What modifies a fizzle check are (a) your appropriate skill (Abjuration, Evocation, Brass, Wind, etc.) (b) your primary statistic (Intelligence for Magi, Wisdom for Priests, Dexterity and Charisma for Bards) (c) the difficulty of the spell and (d) the level of the spell.</P>
<P>When you gain a new rank of spells, any spell that you cast of that rank has a 20% chance of fizzling. This assumes that (a) your appropriate skill (Evocation, for example) is at its maximum value (b) that you have a minimum of 75 in your appropriate statistic (Intelligence, etc.) and (c) that we did not set the difficulty of the spell to less then average (some spells we assign a lower difficulty, making them easier to cast - to date, we have not made any spells with higher difficulty). </P>
<P>If your appropriate statistic is greater then 75 (Intelligence, Wisdom, etc.), we reduce your fizzle percent by 1% for every X points of your statistic above 75. </P>
<P>Each spell assumes that you have a skill equal to (5 * level you go the spell). A Wizard getting Bind Affinity (Wizard gets her 4th rank spells at level 12, so 5 * 12 =60) would have that spell assuming that she had a 60 Alteration skill for purposes of casting. With a 60 skill in Alteration (the appropriate skill) and a 75 intelligence, our wizard would have an 80% chance of successfully casting Bind Affinity. For every skill point that our Wizard has above 60, the percent chance of fizzling goes down by 1%, to a minimum of a 5% chance of fizzling. Thus, three levels (15 skill points) after our Wizard gets Bind Affinity, she will be able to max out her Alteration and have a mere 5% chance of fizzling the spell. </P>
<P>A high intelligence would help her to max out her ability to cast Bind Affinity without fizzling earlier.</FONT> </P>
<P>I don't play a caster, so how is this relevant?  In my experience, both in the business world, and in the MUD world, programmers try to have consistency in their formulas.  This is mostly to simplify the programs, but I suppose laziness can be taken into account as well.  So, the basis of my formula.</P>
<FONT COLOR="#ffffff"><P>(% of Success) @ Trivial Level = 80%</P>
</FONT><P>Try making a few hundred metal bits right when they hit trivial. I found that the numbers matched within 1%. A very good ratio! Now, the last part of the formula threw me off a bit. I believe I have cracked it based on observing other skills in the game, and so far, the numbers seem pretty accurate.</P>
<FONT COLOR="#ffffff"><P>{ [ (Current Skill) - (Trivial Level) ] + (Wisdom - 75) / 5} / 100 = (% of Success)</P>
</FONT><P>So far, this seems to be accurate. However, it also seems to top off at about 95%. Now, if anyone disagrees with the <FONT COLOR="#ffffff">divide by 5</FONT> part, please let me know how your numbers seem to crunch out. So far, it has at least been in the ballpark for me, but I no longer work on trivial skills as often as I used to. Now, the to calculate the true cost.</P>
<FONT COLOR="#ffffff"><P>[ X + Y ] / { { [ (Current Skill) - (Trivial Level) ] + (Wisdom - 75) / 5} / 100 } = (Adjusted Cost)</P>
</FONT><P>Now, why are we dividing by this formula? It is quite simple. <FONT COLOR="#ffffff">X</FONT> plus <FONT COLOR="#ffffff">Y</FONT> result in product <FONT COLOR="#ffffff">Z</FONT>, with a unit of one (usually). Now, extrapolate this out to 100 units. Of those 100 units, you will successfully make <FONT COLOR="#ffffff">(% of Success)</FONT>. This ratio would be the same for one unit, if you made only one at a time. So, the formula for proving this would be a simple ratio.</P>
<FONT COLOR="#ffffff"><P>100 / (% of Success) = 1 / (% of Success)</P>
</FONT><P>Now, with all the difficult formulas out of the way, let's go to the one that makes the most sense of them all.</P>
<FONT COLOR="#ffffff"><P>(Adjusted Cost) + Markup = (Selling Price)</P>
</FONT><P>What? You don't think I should make SOME profit?!? Actually, I don't really make items for profit (usually), but I do round up to the nearest whole coin (ok, ok, in some cases it is no near - deal). However, you should use your own judgement. If you feel an item is worth more than the adjusted cost suggests (called Added Value in Accounting), charge appropriately.</P>
