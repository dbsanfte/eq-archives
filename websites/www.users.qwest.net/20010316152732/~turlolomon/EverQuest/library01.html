<FONT COLOR="#ffffff"><P>I have fought many duels in EverQuest, and have accomplished a significant win ratio of over 90%. This includes people who were higher level than me, in some cases as much as five. Now, please note, I do not like dueling outside of tournaments. In most of these cases, I was the person who was challenged, which means I would use ever trick up my sleeve to win. Here are some of the most colorful examples. I deleted the names to protect the stupid.</P>
</FONT><P>#1) A monk challenged me to a friendly duel right outside Befallen. He was only two levels above me, so I thought I would give it a shot. We were supposed to duel down to two bubbles. Because of his mend wound ability, I reached the two bubble mark first. I told him that I yield, and he continued to fight, making it very clear he wanted to kill me. I had no desire to die, as it would mean a lengthy time spent running back to my corpse. I ran into Befallen, around the corner, right up to the zone line and immediately hit Hide. The monk, without thinking ran right after me and zoned.</P>

</FONT><P>#2) A necromancer got a bit upset with me after I fooled him with a pickpocket emote. He insisted that I really stole money from him. I tried to talk to him, but it just made him angry, so I walked off. While I was fighting, I received a duel challenge from him, and was immediately slammed by spells. Luckily, the "but you are protected" message put my mind at ease. After the fight, I walked up to him, asked what his problem was, to which he started to ignore me. I walked away, then hit hide again, just on the border of the campsite. The necromancer had his turn, got beat up quite a bit, and was out of mana. He came back, and sat down right in front of me. The next thing he saw was "Turlo has accepted your challenge." And "Turlo backstabs you for 76 damage." All hell broke loose. Three people tried to heal the necromancer, but to no avail. I offered him a chance to yield at 1/2 bubble, but he asked me to kill him. One more strike and it was over.</P>

<FONT COLOR="#ffff00"><P>Lesson: Always let your opponent issue the duel challenge.</P>
</FONT><P>#2-A) After the duel, a friend of the necromancer came to challenge me. He was a monk two levels higher than me. I really didn't feel like dueling someone again so soon, so I explained to him the reasons why I must decline. First, he challenged me. Second, he at first tried to attack me in an unfair situation (not realizing it would not work). Third, he had three people healing him, where I had none. Fourth, I offered him a chance to yield. Finally, I am a rogue. You expected me to fight fair? These reasons satisfied the monk, and he backed down, offering his hand in friendship.</P>
<FONT COLOR="#ffff00"><P>Lesson: Learn to pick your fights.</P>
</FONT><P>#2-B) Later that night, I came across the necromancer again screaming for help because a giant spider was gnawing on his leg. I jumped in and saved his life. He was very confused why I helped him. I explained that I had no hard feelings, the duel took care of all of that. He told me that he had a lot to think about with the way he acted, and offered his hand to me in friendship. I took it.</P>
<FONT COLOR="#ffff00"><P>Lesson: Don't make enemies where it is just as easy to make a friend.</P>
</FONT><P>#3) I was talked into dueling a druid two levels above me by a group of people. Peer pressure. Got to love it. Several people observed this fight, and couldn't believe the results. According to several witnesses, the druid played it by the numbers. Snare then blast. Snare one, I resist. Snare two, I resist. Snare three sticks, but then I start jumping. Once I was in melee range, the fight was over, snare or not.</P>

<FONT COLOR="#ffff00"><P>Lesson: Know your enemies strengths, and weaknesses, and how to exploit both.</P>
</FONT><P>#4) A necromancer two levels above me who has been wanting a piece of me for a long time issued a challenge to me in Lower Guk. Now, Lower Guk is not exactly the best place to have a duel. I did not accept. I told him to watch his back. Then, I waited. Not five minutes, not ten. I waited for one hour, and observed that he was AFK. That is when I attacked him. Was it fair? He did issue the challenge.</P>

</FONT><P>#5) I am not sure how it built up, but a dwarven warrior challenged me to a duel in Blackburrow while I was waiting for a Blackburrow Cask to drop. We decided to fight on the bridge over the rock below. Since this was a friendly duel, it was not meant to be to the death. We stopped at two bubbles several times through the night, the dwarf amazed at how fast I was taking him down. He got smart though. During our last bought, which was to the death, he put his back to the edge of the bridge so I couldn't get behind him. I ran, jumped, spun around, and backstabbed him on the way down. I landed unharmed at the bottom, and was ready to pound him some more.</P>

<FONT COLOR="#ffff00"><P>Lesson: Remember safefall, and use it to your advantage.</P>
</FONT><P>#6) A ranger decided to attempt to duel me in Misty Thicket. The fight was long, bloody, and very evenly matched. I thought I was done for when he knocked me unconcious. He then backed off and started healing himself. The target was off me at that point. I gained conciousness then immediately hit hide. Sure, he was healing himself up, but I was bandaging like a madman. We both ended up with half health. The fight continued, initiated by a backstab from behind. Once again, it was evenly matched. At the final moment, the ranger got cocky and decided to finish me off with a spell. That was his undoing. While his hands waved in the air, a dagger in his back silenced him.</P>

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ffffff"><P>I hope this will help you in the future with your own duels.  As I come up with new lessons, they will be added.  Feel free to send me your own devious ideas.  I will give you credit, and you can share with the world just what a rogue is capable of.  Muhahahaha!</P>
