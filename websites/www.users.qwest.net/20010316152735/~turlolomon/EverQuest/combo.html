Combo meals.  What are they?  How did they come to my attention?  It is quite simple, actually.  Quite awhile ago, I was perusing the websites dealing with EverQuest.  I came across more than a few that went back to the good ol' beta days.  On one of these websites, I came across rumors about baking foodstuffs that have special powers.  After doing a little more digging, I have uncovered the following.  Mind you, none of this is official and I have not been able to very any of it.</P>
<P>In almost every baking book, there are references to what an item goes best with.  Looking at those particulars, it seemed that there was a recipe being given.  Could these be the secret to grand mastery of baking?  What is the missing part?  I have a theory on that as well, but more on that later.  When these special meals were created, you would gain a specific spell effect on your body.  For example, a fisherman's platter would give you enduring breath.</P>
<P>Possible theory number one.  When items are eaten in a particular order in your inventory, then the beverage, if alcoholic in nature, was immediately right clicked, you would gain the benefit.  Now, although this would interrupt exactly what was given quite literately, it would be cumbersome in play unless food was eaten manually.  Although EverQuest is based on MUD code, that particular feature did not carry over.  So, this theory seems to be a wash.</P>
<P>Theory number two.  Those items are combined in an oven.  I tried this.  It doesn't work.  However, what if they need to be combined with an additional item?  Oh, for example, a bowl.  Yes, a bowl.  Something that is made with pottery and has absolutely no use in the game.  Well, I tried it with medium bowls.  I tried it with large bowls.  Wait, I can try it with small bowls.  Oh, those are disabled?  I wonder why.  That is my current theory.  No basis on fact, just rumor.  But think about it.  It would explain why bowls were added into the game in the first place, and also explain why the small bowl doesn't work.</P>
<P>For your perusal, I have compiled all the combo recipes listed in every cookbook.  Enjoy.</P>
