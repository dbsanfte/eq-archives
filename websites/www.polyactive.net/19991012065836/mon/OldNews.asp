				<B>Freeport Bazaar - Thanks for coming!</B><BR>
				We had a huge turnout to our bazaar in the tunnel to North Ro.  Thank you to everyone who showed up to buy and sell!
				<P>
				We were somewhat disappointed by the turnout for the scavenger hunt afterwards.  Perhaps it was because we let too much time lapse between the bazaar and hunt, or maybe it was not advertised enough.  The winner of the 20 platinum price only return 7 fire beetle eyes and a rat ear.  In the time that was given, anyone should have been able to scavenge more items than this.  Perhaps next time we'll see a better turnout.

				A welcome goes out to Longleaf, our latest member.  He was initiated in Kelethin after a long day of trading.  We're glad to have you!

				<B>The Traveling Bazaar was a Success!</B><BR>
				The traveling bazaar yesterday was a great success.  We had a little trouble in the beginning with Halas.  This was due largely in part to people waiting until the last minute to get there.  In the future I'd highly suggest getting to the starting destination the night before.  Once we got started though, the bazaar was terrific.  A few items were sold in Halas.  The next stop was Qeynos.  We were a hit there and many items auctioned.  Some items brought prices that surprised everyone.  After Qeynos we headed to the wood bridge in the Karanas.  Not as much business was done here due to the lack of a close bank, but many people followed us to Rivervale for the next bazaar.  The Rivervale bazaar went very well and we had a large turnout.  Next we moved to the tunnel between North Ro and East Commons.  This was our largest turnout of the day.  Despite the large group of people, things were pretty organized and many items changed hands.  
				<BR>
				As the bazaar ended, a quest unfolded with the theft of Typhanie's engagement ring.  Koru, a local rogue, stole the ring and retreated to freeport where people hunted him for half an hour.  When he was spotted behind the warrior guild by Banadin he retreated to the arena where the final battle took place.  Koru did very well at defending himself but was eventually laid to rest.  With the ring recovered by Banadin, he was presented with a 15pp reward from Typhanie.
				<BR>
				Next, we hopped the boat and headed to Kelethin.  Running about 15 minutes late, we arrived and the bazaar began.  Being the last stop, we auctioned items for almost two hours here.  Most of our inventory was depleted and we resorted to a few product blowouts to get rid of items we no longer carried.
				<BR>
				A hint to people who want to attend the next traveling bazaar.  If you want hard-to-find items, be sure to show up at our first stop.  The good items go quickly.  If you want unbeatable prices, be at the last leg of our journey.
				<P>
				We'll be discussing changes to the next bazaar to make it better.  First off I think we all agree that we need more than 30 minutes at each stop.  This event already lasted 8 hours, so we'll need to find a way to make up for the extended stops.  What I thought was really cool was the people that followed us from place to place.  Next time maybe we can organize the traveling a little better so we all stay together.
				<BR>
				Pictures from the bazaar will be posted in the photo album soon!

				<B>Cbus gets what he deserves!</B><BR>
				If you've ever hunted in North Ro, you've probably heard of Cbus.  He is the worst kill stealer that I have come in contact with since I started playing the game in Phase 4.
				<BR>
				Several days ago we dueled and I forced him to flee.  His tactic is to target someone and then keep running around so you can't find him.  Fortunately I had track and it didnt work with me.
				Later that night he was <A HREF="http://www.polyactive.net/mon/images/Cbus1.jpg">stealing my kills</A> and made no bones about it. 
				<BR>
				Well, today Cbus was back to his <A HREF="http://www.polyactive.net/mon/images/Cbus2.jpg">normal tricks</A>.  This time he stole one kill too many and got in <A HREF="http://www.polyactive.net/mon/images/Cbus3.jpg">over his head</A>.  When it became apparent that he could not outrun the dervish he <A HREF="http://www.polyactive.net/mon/images/Cbus4.jpg">turned to fight</a>.  A crowd gathered to watch the battle, but amazingly enough, only 1 person offered help (he didnt know Cbus).  <A HREF="http://www.polyactive.net/mon/images/Cbus5.jpg">Poor Cbus</A>.

				<B>Travelling Bazaar</B><BR>
				Guild registration will take place soon and I'd like to start planning our first event.  I think the travelling bazaar would be a great one to start off with.  Keep it in mind and start thinking about what you'd like to bring to sell or auction.  You'll also want to save cash as I'm sure certain items will be bargains in certain parts of the world.  We could plan the bazaar to travel the continent in a single day, or stretch it out over a week or more.  If you have ideas for times, routes or locations please let me know!
				<P>
				<B>Guild Hunt</B><BR>
				In order for the bazaar to be a success, we should have some hard to find items.  One of the newest items which hasn't even really hit the market yet is the new Hand-made Backpack with 10 slots.  Only a couple people have made them, but there are a lot of people out there that would like to own them.  In order to make one of these packs, we need a High Quality Bear Pelt found on the bears around Qeynos and the Karanas.  I propose we schedule a hunt to collect as many of these pelts as we can in preparation for the bazaar.  All proceeds from the pack sales should go to the guild treasury.
				<P>
				<B>Guild Meeting</B><BR>
				We'll discuss these topics in our first guild meeting, but in the meantime feel free to email me your comments.  I'm suggesting that the first guild meeting be held in Freeport this coming weekend regardless of our registration status.  Please let me know what days and times will be best for you to attend so I dont have to pick one from thin air.

				<B>Registration</B><BR>
				The guild registration email was sent to Verant and now we wait for a reply.  Hopefully it wont be long.  I suspect each member will still have to send an email to Verant letting them know they wish to join the guild.  I'll let everyone know if this is the case.
