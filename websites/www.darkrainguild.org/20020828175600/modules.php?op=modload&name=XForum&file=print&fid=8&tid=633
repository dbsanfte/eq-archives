<p>I am at the point that I feel like I am going to decline to go kill the next lodi or whatever, if I feel like I will have to handle loot at all.<br />
<br />
I think the next time something like that happens, I am going to be saying: look if I handle loot, we are going to /random by need on everyfuckingthing that drops.  If I am not handling loot, you better decide who is, because unless you decide in advance, Im not wasting my time.<br />
<br />
Basically, we got ninja'd because I was thinking "oh great here we go again, how are we supposed to do this?" while I should have been thinking "lock the corpse, and /2 tell me if you want shield OR eyepatch for upgrades and which one you'd like to roll for."<br />
<br />
I hate GD random too.  Look at Elbin.  Thx Lodi!  Nice Shield, Eyepatch, and Belt!  We have killed Lodi, what, 3 times? maybe 4? and Elbin has 3 loots from him.  Yeah random is sooo fair.<br />
<br />
I had an idea once... tho it would be a major pain to maintain it.  I was thinking of doing a master /random list.  Say we get everyone to do a /rand 1000.  And we keep a list in order like this.<br />
<br />
Name |  Roll  |<br />
<br />
Melee1   975  <br />
Priest1   654 <br />
Melee2   523 <br />
Caster1  319 <br />
Priest2   276 <br />
Caster2  111<br />
<br />
Every time you are awarded loot, you lose 1000 off your roll.  Every time you attend a "RAID" you get say 300 or so added to your roll.  So winning essentially puts you at the bottom of the list, while attending raids helps you rise up the list.  Basically, even if you rolled the 111, you will be sitting above someone that has not attended the last 3 raids if you have.<br />
<br />
I know this is just a points system =(  But loot sucks sooo bad anyway.  The way I see it, the system awards participation, while keeping the same people from winning ALL the time.  If needed, we can make UBBER items, say dragon haste for example, cost 2000 off your roll.  Target of opportunity raids may only cost 600 if you win a drop.  The numbers can be tweaked if they prove to be unbalanced.<br />
<br />
This kinda helps monks too... who help on raids like arena where only a FEW decent monk items drop.  They would be building points up for something that would really help them, like a Umbral bracer.<br />
<br />
Truthfully, I would not have a problem with loot at all if Bem was there to lay down the law every time.  And I am just shooting from the hip with my points idea, im not particulary attached to it.<br />
<br />
Any advice or feedback?</p>

<p>I'd like to post about this, but I'm not sure what to say or how to say it right.  I'll think about it today and try to get it right before I come blabbing on here.  Just wanted you to know I read this KD.</p>

<p>Lots of points here I want to look over - but first, Im going to lunch <img src="modules/XForum/images/smilies/wink.gif" border=0><br />
<br />
Real quick though- you really think this point system is less complicated than saying "Shield- tell me if you want it" and then picking peopl to roll for it?<br />
<br />
On the other hand, if we want to have the guild be more independant and do raids without us, they need a clear black and white loot rule set. <br />
<br />
Ok - Ill think of this over lunch and get back to you....<br />

<p>I think that some of this is once again what Bem said, our loot rules are only as good as we make them.  Random is only as good as we make it.  Yeah Elbin has won a random on 2 things that Lodi has dropped.  But what did we say when rolling for the belt?  If you will use it for your main and it's an upgrade, /ran now.  The belt was an upgrade for him, just as it would have been for Tanean or Leaas had they won.  What if we could instead sent Elbin a tell asking him not to roll since he had won an item on the last Lodi kill?  Since I know Elbin, I know he wouldn't have been upset at that in the least.  He wants what's fair for the guild too.  But on the other hand, if we say "roll if it will upgrade your main" and it upgrades his main, he's gonna roll.  If WE want things to turn out differently, we have to make it happen.  I don't want this to look like I'm defending Elbin.  I can't believe he has won 2 things on /ran and a quest piece either.  But I don't necessarily think it's his fault.  We told him he could roll, and /ran is random!  When I /ran I assume I will lose, since 98% of the time I do.  <img src="modules/XForum/images/smilies/wink.gif" border=0>  Elbin rolled assuming he would lose too.  But he happened to win.  Would we be this upset over this if Leaas had won one thing, Elbin had won one thing, Bustyn had won one thing, etc?  No, that "looks" more fair, and it may be because everyone gets something, but different people show up each time.  How can we pass loot out fairly so that everyone gets something eventually when we don't even know who will be available to show up for the next one?<br />
<br />
As for the points thing... you all know how I LOVE points systems!  <img src="modules/XForum/images/smilies/wink.gif" border=0>  The part I don't really understand is why do you /ran to get your first number?  Wouldn't it be easier to start everyone out with 1000pts?  or 0pts?  I guess the /ran just doesn't make sense to me.  Would people get points for coming to kill lodi?  Or only for raids that are planned like Kael, WW, Fri and Sat?  What if you get a drop that's a quest item?  Does that cost points too?  Say Dae and Leris both needed the same idol that dropped in KAel for the Tunare bracer (I know Dae already has it)  Do they spend points to get it?  Do they roll and whoever wins spends points on it? Would points count for everything?  Like what if Lluweni leads to groups to Kael and no officers are on?  Do they get points for that?  How do they award loot with no officers there to tell them what points they have?  I'm probably asking really dumb questions, but points are really confusing to me, and I'm not sure how or who would keep track of them and have them available and updated all the time.<br />
<br />
I agree, a simple solution would be less of a headache for us, but what if there isn't a simple solution?  What do we do?  Loot is just another reason why I HATE the "higher" end game.  Ahh for the simple days of exp groups and killing.  Where I was really excited to win a forest loop in a /ran in FM.  <img src="modules/XForum/images/smilies/wink.gif" border=0>  Loot, Rage, guild relations..... I find myself loggin on less and less and less.<br />
<br />
Sorry for my rambling.  Tell me what to do so I can help with a solution instead of being a problem.<br />

<p>Loot issue aside for a moment, one thing here kinda bothers me. <br />
In my head, each officer acts as Leader of the Guild at several times during the course of play. Each of you should feel confident enough to make these decisions in my absence and know i will back you up regardless of if I agree or not (unless it is WAY off base - like something none of us have ever done and I dont even worry about). <br />
To the guild, I will support you and your decision - we may talk about it here, but The Guild sees us as of one mind about such things. <br />
So when you do Lodi, or any other situation like that, use the rules we have to make the decision, act on it, and we all move on. If you interrupt a rule differently than I do, great - there is an opportunity for us to clarify something for the future. <br />
I have said this before, and I truly believe it. <br />
Our loot system is a good one. The system isnt failing us, we are not using it properly.<br />
<br />
Maybe I have failed you by not supporting you as I should. <br />
Maybe I have unreasonable expectations of what each of you are comfortable doing. <br />
<br />
Yes, Loot is a pain, but I see that we are all distracted by littel loot issues and missing what's truly important here. Let's ease up on ourselves for once. If we feel someone gets too much Lodi loot, ask them in tells to not roll, if they chose to roll anyway, then we have done our part and can't force them. I certainly don't want to decide loot - let the roll do it. Is it fair? Not always - after all, its /random 100 - not /fair 100. <br />
No matter how fair we think we are being, someone always disagrees. We can't make everyone happy. <br />
A friend once told me everyone is responsible for their own happiness - you cant MAKE anyone happy or unhappy - they do it to themselves. <br />
<br />
We need to take that attitude more often - we do what we feel is right and let everyone else worry if they are happy. <br />
<br />
We let the /ran decide most loot - we just guide and decide who can /ran. <br />
<br />
This make any sense?</p>

<p>First of all, I have nothing against Elb... Just used him as an example to outline the problem that I have been having with loot.  Every time I ask disco for advice, there is dead silence it seems.  I don't want to keep track of everything that someone has won and try to determine if they should get a roll or not.<br />
<br />
Bem, I guess I am not comfortable with whatever the "guild-guidelines" are.  I really don't mind how YOU do loot, but I am not you and thus unless you can explain exaclty what you do, I wont be able to emulate you.  Frankly, I feel you decide on the fly on a case by case basis, and you would problably handle each case differently than I.  There are some very broad guidelines, but they are not enough to bolster my confidence.<br />
<br />
And Bustyn, for every question you raise on any point system, I can raise 2 more with how awarded loot is assigned or how people are hand picked to /random.  How much is raid attendence a factor?  How much is being a hydra a factor?  How much is level and class a factor?  How do you choose (like in the case of the chain BP we got) who gets something when BOTH or multiple people deserve it?  What if someone has already won today, or the last time we killed Lodi?<br />
<br />
As far as my proposed system, the /rand thing is to establish an initial loot order.  When something drops, people on the top have first rights if they wish to loot.  I *still* think certain things like breastplates, post epic weapons, and similar mega-items be awarded.<br />
<br />
Anyway... the point is I do not feel confident or competent awarding loot.  Perhaps the true solution is that I refrain from being involved in it.  Sure I will offer my viewpoint when neccesary, but I will not go as far as deciding who gets what.  I'm saying that because I don't want to across like I am trying to force a change.  I am only trying to say that I am not personally comfortable handling these things under the current system, and offering suggestion on what I feel would help.<br />
<br />
Maybe all we need are some WRITTEN guidelines that we can all look over?  I think that may put me at rest anyway.</p>

<font size="2"><b>Assassin</b></font> - <font size="1">7/21/2002 at 05:16 AM</font>
<p>Yeah, there's really no reason why we can't make a guideline. I'm tired of loot discussions turning into pointless arguments.</p>

<p>The way my guild does loot (OoP), is IMO one of the best ways, other then a DKP system (too complicated hehe)<br />
<br />
They have a table with each member's name and loot they aquired the whole time they been in the guild. when a loot item drops, an officer with a 2nd computer will check the table list, and see who has the least amount of loot, if the item will be an upgrade for them, and how many raids they attended. The officer then relays the info back to the other officers, and then they vote on who should receive the item in question.<br />
The player with the most votes, obviously gets the item. Once that happens, they put  the item, and the day they got the item in the table list, so that person won't get 2 items in a row (unless it was gonna rot)<br />
Their order of preference is as follows (don;t quote me on this, I could be wrong)<br />
1.) Is it for a main or a twink.<br />
2.) Will it benefit the guild as a whole.<br />
3.) Have they attended a good amount of raids required for the item that dropped.<br />
4.) How long have they been in the guild<br />
5.) How long has it been since they last got a loot drop.<br />
6.) Is the item gonna be used as an upgrade, or a "toy"<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm sure theres more, but thats all I know about their loot policy. Now, you're prolly asking yourself how I know all this, and I'm not even an officer in OoP.<br />
Lets just say I have a lot of good friends in the guild that tell me things =p<br />
<br />
You should also try www.guildboss.com ,<br />
It's guild management software, helps you keep track of things like raid attendance, loot distribution, meetings, etc..  I think it costs like $30, but its well worth the money, and I'm sure if you searched around, you could find a warez version of it =p<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<p>Yeah, that's the kind of thing I wanted, Venerial.</p>

<font size="2"><b>Bemeni</b></font> - <font size="1">7/21/2002 at 03:58 PM</font>
<p>Isn't this what we do now except that we don't have a spreadsheet and some items random? <br />
<br />
Maybe I'm so confused because I think our system has all these things you are saying you want.<br />
<br />
I'll look again through some posts - I know I saw a program either here or someone sne tme that can do this stuff. Maybe we need to use that. <br />

I let Elb get 3 lodi loots in 3 lodi kills!<br />
