<p>I'd like to make Tabber Druid class officer - with hopes of making him a full officer soon. <br />
<br />
He'd mostly hold spells, coordinate druid stuff during raids, help set the policies liek last call for port, etc. <br />
<br />
Most of our druids are alreayd epic, so he wouldn't have much to do there. but if we did need more druid epics, he would help on those. <br />
<br />
I'd also liek Jehm to be a class officer, but I need to have a long logn talk with him first. My main concern with jehm is his blatant disregard for rules he doenst agree with. <br />
<br />
Any objections to either one of them? As class officers, they wouldn't be in the officer channel - but would have officer tags. They couldn't tag anyone of course, and they wouldnt have to yell at anyone or anything like we do. Class Officers do not have the power to remove members. <br />
<br />
Thoughts? Other recommendations?</p>

<p>I like Tabber, he has several times dropped what he was doing and was at a place where I needed help 20 minutes before everyone else.<br />
<br />
As for Jehm, I like him, he's funny, but I don't know about that.<br />
<br />
I have to say that I am not all over this whole "class officers" things. When I need help as a Shaman, I know bustyn will do what she can to help me. If I need help as a monk, I know kaedo will give superb advice.<br />
<br />
Also, I even more strongly disagree with officer tags for class officers. I'd rather not have 18 officers in this guild, to be quite honest. Whether or not they have power over anything. An officer tag is easily abused.<br />
<br />
In addition to that, it causes confusion in authority among those outside the guild. When I get into a sticky situation with a guild outside mine, I /guildstatus them, find the officer, if any, and talk to them. I can easily see how an Class Officer will try to step in and be the problem solver, and quite possibly make things worse.<br />
<br />
But if we are going to do the Class Officer thing anyway, we could just call them the officers, give them the title of officer on boards, and refer everyone to them.<br />
<br />
I'm not trying to pick a fight or anything, I could be wrong, or my thoughts may be irrevelant, but just thought I should mention it.<br />
<br />
Now, for Tabber as a normal officer, I dont think I have any problems with that, he has shown many times his loyalty to the guild and determination to help them. I have heard of his /tells to other members talking of how unfair our loot decisions are sometimes, but I believe after a few weeks in officer chat, he will understand things better and become a better leader.<br />
<br />
I think that's all I have to say hehe.</p>

<p>Like every member in MV was an officer, eventually =b.  Silly but true.  I think the absolute power of an officer should not be taken lightly.  We really need an alternative way to appreciate those members that are truly dedicated to the guild.<br />
<br />
With that said, you mentioned they would really only be figure-head "officers."  I personally don't have a problem with that, until someone abuses their power.  I would only ask you make it very clear that there will be consequences for abusing their officer powers.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, I am ALL FOR delegating some responsibilty out.  Bem you shoulder way too much, we really need to work together as leaders and spread the load out a bit.<br />
<br />
As far as Tabber as a full officer... I am only concerned that a change may disrupt the continuity? that we currently share.  Maybe I am reading too far into what little I have read or heard from Tabber.  But I am not sure he would "fit in" so to speak.  I just figure that all the officers we currently have are pretty close friends, and outside of raid chatter, I don't know Tabber from Adam.</p>
