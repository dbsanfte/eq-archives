<p>Friday, 6 pm eastern, Kaedo will lead us closer to Zorgar's epic!<br />
Starts in Plane of Air -only 2 groups will be going on due to costs associated with ports. Then we will kill as many mobs as we need to get another epic monk!!</p>

<p>Actually!<br />
<br />
Start with Eejag, who is a quickie kill unless hes not up.  Then to Gwan, and to Trunt if we have time / numbers.<br />
<br />
If we get finished soon enough, and have time to wait for Zorg to cycle Trunts head to the right peoples, we may try to make him epic in one night.  Don't hold your breath tho Zorg   <img src="modules/XForum/images/smilies/wink.gif" border=0></p>

<p>Well I was hoping to be on to help with this, but I got a big factiopn hit with the wife (sounds strange to say  <img src="modules/XForum/images/smilies/smile.gif" border=0>) for staying up to participate in the events in Qeynos Hills.  So I will be trying to repair that faction on friday night instead.  Will still be there for HoT on Saturday since she will be away all day.</p>

<p>Opps, well I thought there was something going on this friday that I wanted to help with.  Maybe it was the shawl war that we were going to do.  Anyway see you all Saturday</p>
