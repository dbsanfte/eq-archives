<p>OK - I am ready to go to Hate again. I have talked to a few of you to make sure we have key classes (cleric, enchanter, etc), Kaedo has graciously offered to pull for us, and I think we are ready! All DR members are welcome, BUT we are going to keep this a guild only raid. We want to try and beat the rush, so we are heading up at 9 am EST. Plan for about 6 hours, bring plenty of food and water. <br />
<br />
Dark Rain has attempted Hate before and Failed. We have learned from our mistakes and think we are ready to go up successful. <br />
<br />
Here's what you can do to help us succeed:<br />
Know your Mobs -See below<br />
Know the Zone - I posted a map <img src="modules/XForum/images/smilies/smile.gif" border=0><br />
Pay Attention - You standing in the wrong place for 5 seconds is enough to aggro the second floor and wipe us out. Be Alert!<br />
NO AoE - No DOTS<br />
<br />
Mobs of Hate: <br />
<br />
MOST RESISTANT: Spite Golem, mini-bosses<br />
VERY RESISTANT: Ashenbone Drake, Scorn Banshee, Forsaken Revenants<br />
MEDIUM RESIST.: Cleric of Innoruuk, Loathing Lich, Kiraikuei<br />
LOW RESISTANT: Abhorrent, Ire Ghast, Revultant Rat<br />
<br />
Cleric of Innoruuk - Cleric - They look like a Dark Elf guard. They have high magic resist, so harder to mez, and they love to complete heal. They also buff the mobs they pass with cleric buffs. Keep them stunned (bash/ slam) while fighting and kill them fast. They drop cleric gear. They do not see rogues or even normal invisible. They have a normal aggro range.<br />
<br />
Ire Ghast - undead Shadow Knight - They look like a ghoul and have low magic resist, so easy to mez, but love to HarmTouch, and do it a lot. Undead magic works on them. They drop some Paladin weapons (mace and sword) and a shield, and can also drop the druid shield, though extremely rare. They do not see rogues, but do see normal player invisible (although invis to undead would work). They have a small aggro range.<br />
<br />
Revultant Rat - Warrior - They look like a giant diseased rat and have low magic resist, but proc Deadly Poison. Only drop is a Ranger Whip. They do not see rogues, but may or may not see normal invis (some do, some don't). They have a small aggro range.<br />
<br />
Spite Golem - Shaman - They look like a rock golem. They have insane magic resist (although poison, disease, and the wizard Lure spells will usually stick). This is the most important target most times. If you get 2, one warrior, usually the backup assist, will keep second one busy while the group kills number 1. It is possible to kill several, but very, very tough, so be careful. They love to cast SoW and other Alacrity on everything close to them. They drop shaman armor including a shield, and a druid shield. They do not see a rogue, but see everything else. They have a large aggro range.<br />
<br />
Loathing Lich - undead Wizard - They look like a spectre and have very low magic resist but more hp than most mobs in Hate, plus are undead so undead magic works well, so usually easy kills. But they will cast the wizard damage shield (the annoying 2 damage spam shield). They drop a Necromancer rod. They DO see a rogue as well as anything else. *** BE CAREFUL *** They have a small self-aggro range, but will pass chain-aggro other mobs a very large range.<br />
<br />
Abhorrent - Rogue - They look like gargoyles and have very low magic resist, but love to backstab, so make sure the puller is careful pulling them. They drop rogue gear. They do not see rogues or normal invisible. They have a small aggro range.<br />
<br />
Haunted Chest - Warrior - They look like a bog box with teeth. They will proc a Nullify Magic, so they will strip your buffs. They can drop any armor item from the Planes of Fear, and possibly from Hate. They do not see a rogue, but do see others. They have an extremely small aggro range and are very slow. When pulling, the puller has to stay close, or the box will forget and go home. They even aggro other mobs at a very short range. Boxes spawn only in fixed locations. They are not on any other spawn table.<br />
<br />
Kiraikueis - undead Monk - They look like a mummy and have low magic resist. They will proc Strong Disease. They are undead, so undead magic works well on them. They drop warrior gear and a monk Shuriken. They do not see rogues, but do see normal invis, though invis to undead would work. They have a very large aggro range, but a small pass-on range, so they will aggro with anything close, but not aggro the mobs around them... usually.<br />
<br />
Scorn Banshee - undead Warrior - They look like a female zombie and have low magic resist, but proc Strong Disease and hit a ton. But undead magic works. They drop Bard gear. They DO see rogues and all invis, including invis to undead, regardless of what con says. *** BE CAREFUL *** They do have a small aggro range, though.<br />
<br />
Forsaken Revanant, Male - undead Magician - They look like male vampires and have normal magic resistance. They also cast a mean damage shield and nasty AE direct damage. Undead magic does work. They drop mage gear. They do not see rogues, but do see normal invis. They have normal aggro range.<br />
<br />
Forsaken Revanant, Female - undead Enchanter - They look like female vampires and have high magic resistance, but they do not cast charm. They do cast a damage shield, though. Undead magic works. They drop Enchanter gear. They do not see rogues but do see normal invis. They have normal aggro range.<br />
<br />
Ashenbone Drake - Necromancer - Looks like a skeletal dragon or a small DracoLiche from Fear. They have high magic resist and love to cast Fear, plus they hit like a tank. They drop a tank axe or a Shadow Knight shield or weapon. They do not see rogues, but do see normal invis. They have an insane aggro range and have been known to aggro stuff across the zone. Be extremely careful on this one's aggro.<br />
<br />
Maestro of Rancor - Bard - Looks like Lord Mistmoore, but since he hasn't been seen in a long time, I guess Mistmoore looks like Maestro. He is a Bard, but since NPCs do not use BardSong, you could say he's a warrior. He hits a TON and has an ae lifetap on everything in melee range. And if he has dual weapons, he hits extremely fast. He normally drops 2 items, mostly Bard stuff, though a few monk items and a nice dropable shield. He sees rogues and all normal invis, but his back is usually to the door so no problem. He is the lesser boss of Hate.<br />
<br />
Innoruuk - god - He looks like Innoruuk, no other way to say it. He does a DeathTouch every 30 seconds or so of the fight and loves to cast gravity flux. He has a long list of drops, and most of it nice. He sees rogues and will DeathTouch you in a heart-beat.<br />
<br />

<p>Couple of points of clarification:<br />
<br />
Not sure if we are going to kill any boss or sub-boss - I just wanted you to have ALL the info. <br />
<br />
Map references a camp spot in the corner -again,  it doesn't mean we will go there right away or even at all - It just happens to be a nice map. <br />
<br />
We have many people that this will be their first plane raid. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE help each other so no one is confused or lost. I will designate point people to answer questions while we are there, so that your questions can be answered and we do this with as few deaths as possible. <br />
<br />
I AM SO EXCITED!!!</p>
