<p>Editors note: One way to speed up this quest is to move the quest npc's right next to eachother by having a monk attack one...run to the place with the other NPC and feign and quit out. That way they are right next to each other.<br>

Let me start by saying that to repair Freeport Militia faction is extremely difficult. If you want to repair this faction you better be prepared to spend between 12 to 18 hours doing mindless clicking (similar to any trade skill ).<br>
<br>
The basis for repairing this faction rests on the Inert Potion quest in Erudin. Ill repost it again just to have it all complete in one messages.<br>
<br>
-- START QUOTE --<br>
On the third floor of the castle, Toresian Fhabel is waiting for someone to take an inert potion down to Vials of Vitality, on the first floor of the castle, and give it to Slansin. There are two people who you can give the potion to. Some times the correct person (with a single name, not a surname) 'spawns' in the shop and if you hand the bottle to him, you gain with several Erudin Factions. Usually (it may now be always) if you run this quest then "A Gate Bandit", [now also named Slansin?] will spawn in place of the person you are supposed to give the bottle to. If you hand the bottle to the bandit, the following factions go up: Coalition of Trade Folk Ill, Coalition of Tradefolk, Carson McCabe, Corrupt Qeynos Guards and The Freeport Militia. The best part of these faction changes is that it raises lots of hard to raise factions without lowering any others. You can do this over and over again to improve all these factions at once. This bandit is about L10 or 11, and it is possible that killing him starts a new quest by talking to one of the NPC's in the shop. Also, the bandit tells you that a friend will avenge his death [of course that is standard language], and if you take the boat to Qeynos after doing the quest, a guard will sometimes attack you when you get off. I don't know what happens if you defeat the guard.&nbsp;<br>

The faction changes that occur from this one are:<br>
<br>
[Fri Jul 14 01:30:48 200 Your faction standing with CoalitionofTradeFolkIll got better<br>
[Fri Jul 14 01:30:48 200 Your faction standing with CoalitionofTradefolk got better<br>
[Fri Jul 14 01:30:48 200 Your faction standing with CarsonMcCabe got better<br>
[Fri Jul 14 01:30:48 200 Your faction standing with CorruptQeynosGuards got better<br>
[Fri Jul 14 01:30:48 200 Your faction standing with TheFreeportMilitia got better<br>
<br>
It is important to recognise that the primary faction is the first faction listed. We are going to take advantage of this.<br>
<br>
Killing Lucan is probably a -1000 hit to TheFreeportMilitia faction. Kill him 3 times and you are pretty much at the lowest faction point (My guess around -3000 or -3500).<br>
<br>
You really are going to have to do this quest a LOT of times. We are talking around 1500 times. If you try to run from the third floor to the ground floor and back its going to take you at best 40 seconds. I timed it and I knew that would be a serious problem. Time to improvise.<br>
<br>
Conning Toresian shows hes red. Leave him well alone. However to a level 55 paladin, Slansin was green. Hes extremely low green actually. You'll need to call a friend in or have another machine handy at this point. Give Slansin a gentle stun and then run upstairs and stand next to Toresian. Let Slansin burn all his mana, root him, and then camp out. In the meantime, have a friend hailing him.<br>
<br>
As you can guess when you come back he will be standing next to Toresian. We've suddenly reduced this quest from 40 seconds down to around 2 seconds. Hope at last!<br>
<br>
Set up a hotkey with a say "I wish to assist Toresian." Ok now its going to get a bit painful. You select Toresian, click the button, drop the potion onto Slansin and hit trade. Now you also need to Hail Slansin so he doesnt wander off. Now just repeat this. Con him every now and again and see how your faction looks. The lower the faction you start with, the more chance you wont have to do the next bit. You will probably have to do the quest 900 times to get maximum faction.<br>
<br>
The problem I faced is that I got maximum faction with CoalitionofTradeFolkIll well before I reached dubious with TheFreeportMilitia. The way to know you got maximum faction is that the only faction listed will be CoalitionofTradeFolkIll. Its actually showing an increase but its reached cap.<br>
<br>
I needed a way to lower CoalitionofTradeFolkIll. Bit of searching on Allakhazam and I found the perfect quest.<br>
<br>
The quest is done in Misty Thicket. The quest is printed below:<br>
<br>
-- START QUOTE --<br>
The Honeybugger brother's hand is hurt because he was swarmed by bixies while seeking honeycombs for his employer. Give him a bandage, and he'll thank you with some XP and the following faction: Merchants of Rivervale, Deep pockets, Guardians of the Vale and Mayor Gubbin get better and Coalition of Tradesfolk III get worse.<br>
-- END QUOTE --<br>
<br>
The faction changes that occur from this one are:<br>
<br>
[Sat Jul 29 19:31:10 200 Your faction standing with MerchantsofRiverVale got better<br>
[Sat Jul 29 19:31:10 200 Your faction standing with Deeppockets got better<br>
[Sat Jul 29 19:31:10 200 Your faction standing with GuardiansoftheVale got better<br>
[Sat Jul 29 19:31:10 200 Your faction standing with MayorGubbin got better<br>
[Sat Jul 29 19:31:10 200 Your faction standing with CoalitionofTradeFolkIll got worse<br>
<br>
Every faction goes up except the one we want to go down. How perfect can it be! The lower your faction with MerchantsofRiverVale the better.<br>
<br>
Remember, you do the Inert Potion quest first, then do this one. You want to get maximum use of the CoalitionofTradeFolkIll faction.<br>
<br>
You'll need around 2000-2500 bandages to get from dubious to maximum warmly. I bought 500 at a time and cost me around 35pp for those 500. Cost of this section probably will be 150pp. Not a big deal.<br>
<br>
You can shovel 4 stacks containing 4 bandages to Honeybugger at a time. Gives 16 faction increases per trade. Very fast and effecient. You will want to do this quest until you have maximum warmly faction. You can use the single faction line to tell you have it capped out.<br>
<br>
Once you've done that head back to Erudin and do the Inert Potion quest again till you have reached the cap. This will probably require around 600 times.<br>
<br>
Now its time to take a run to Freeport and do the dreaded con. With luck you should be indifferent.<br>
<br>
The side effects of this questing faction wise are:<br>
<br>
Increased factions:<br>
CoalitionofTradeFolkIll<br>
CoalitionofTradefolk<br>
CarsonMcCabe<br>
CorruptQeynosGuards<br>
TheFreeportMilitia<br>
MerchantsofRiverVale<br>
Deeppockets<br>
GuardiansoftheVale<br>
MayorGubbin<br>
<br>
Decreased factions:<br>
NONE!<br>
<br>
Most of these factions will be maximum warmly or high warmly. These are normally extremely difficult to get factions too. I was warmly with the Dark Elves in South Ro. I was actually able to trade with them. That had me very surprised.<br>
<br>
From a roleplaying perspective there is nothing wrong with being non KOS with Freeport Militia. You might hate them but they dont mind you. I can live with that&nbsp;<br>
<br>
I take no responsibility for any arm or hand injuries! This quest is really going to require lots of clicking and mouse moving. I recommend you take a break every hour or so. You will get tired doing it.<br>
<br>
I hope the information I provided allows people who want to repair their faction to do so. I would love to hear from people who try this and also any information to let us speed up the process.<br>
<br>
Thanks to all the people who provided information in the thread. It gave me a lot of ideas and saved me a lot of time as well. Thanks!<br>
<br>
Good luck!<br>
