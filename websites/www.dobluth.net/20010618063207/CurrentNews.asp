We simply cannot stop when we are so close. I know many people cannot make it back tonight and that is understandable, however, if you can make it, <b> please sign up on the raid planner for tonight </b> to let Vinadin know who is comin and how to group. I believe that we are persuing additional help to clear isle 6 and then isle 7 is easy enough to deal with. If you know anyone that would be will to join us tonight, they can get summoned up to 6 and grouped before we start. We will need LOTS of people to do this island.</td>

Then it will show up in the item list off of the raid planner the next time you click it. <BR><BR>This process provides you a nice interface for viewing possible loot on raids and gives the loot council better tools for making the right decisions as they will now have a database of who has received which items and who is interested in which items. This was previously extremely tedious and done manually.<BR><BR>I hope this tool helps everyone and as always suggestions are always welcome.</td>
