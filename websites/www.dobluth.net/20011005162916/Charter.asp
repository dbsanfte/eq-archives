<span class="charterCaps">I</span>n the beginning, there were many valiant and fearless adventurers who explored 
dark and mystical places in search of knowledge, truth, and magic. Everywhere 
they turned in the land of Norrath, they met with dangerous tests of their 
skills as was expected. What was not expected, but soon well understood, was 
that the land was not only full of fantastic beasts, but sneaky, ruthless people 
as well. They began to feel a drive inside, a new quest.. a quest for 
brotherhood.
<br><br>
<span class="charterCaps">T</span>his drive arises when one adventurer reaches out for help and gets none, when he 
fearlessly places himself in danger for no reward yet receives no gratitude, or 
when he calls for unity amongst others to conquer vile beasts and hears no echo. 
Their character is built from these experiences and now resembles the greatest 
of knights and kings, not in attire, but in poise. They learn to live to a code 
that speaks honor, dignity, loyalty, and truth. They shout of valor, might, and 
brotherhood. They repel the most devilish beast with vulgarity and speak as 
pristinely as a young child to passers-by. The very resonance of their battle 
cries strike fear in to the hearts of their prey and awe in to the hearts of all 
who can hear.
<br><br>
<span class="charterCaps">N</span>ow is the time when these adventurers have found a home. A place like no other, 
where they can share ideas and experiences, where they can lend their service or 
swords for the gratitude of a brother, where they can always find a friend to 
plot and explore, and where there is always someone close by to assist them in 
their times of need. They have all ventured to the house of the 
outcasts....
