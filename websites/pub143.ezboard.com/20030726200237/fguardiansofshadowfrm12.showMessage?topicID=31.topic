<br>
“She was just standing here one moment and on the floor the next.” Over and over the horrified women had repeated to Pequil and Alamathea. And over and over they were looking to the ill woman on the wide bed she and Lanadan had shared for many years now.<br>
The sniffles that often came with the changing of the seasons had been with Illiysha for several days now, but she had paid them no attention until her collapse. She had believed it was simply another passing cold, and the little ones were gathering the first sniffles of the season.<br>
Illiysha was also cold, cold from within despite the blankets and the fire Lanadan had made in the grate beside her. She was complaining that she was cold, that her fingers were numb and she could not stop twitching.<br>
Pequil had been summoned first, having been in the Healer Hall, gathering up supplies for those in the tunnels for the coming months of sniffles, sneezes and, as always, a healthy supply of bandages. She had nearly run down the girl who had come seeking her and had taken her hand firmly. That Lanadan had sent a child to seek her spoke of the moment, and she left what she was doing to find one of Lanadan’s sons in front of the Guild Hall.<br>
Roderick was already storming about the main area, trying to appear brave and without emotion, but his face was ashen and he gave his sister a kiss on the head and ordered her back to the family quarters.<br>
“Roderick, what happened to her?”<br>
“The cooks sent for Father when she collapsed and we took her up to her bed, but she keep saying that she’ss cold, Pequil, and she’s mumbling a lot.”<br>
She patted his hand and followed him to see Illiysha, not at all startled when Lanadan and Alamathea were pressing warm towels onto the older woman’s forehead and inner arms to keep her warm. That a man’s mother, another’s wife was ill, and neither could do anything but stand and watch and no way to assist her was, perhaps, one of the many debilitating things that age brought into the laps of the unsuspecting.<br>
The roar from Roderick when he saw his father’s companion probably shook the entire Guild Hall, and Alamathea ignored him, stating in a rather dictatorial tone that if she was not allowed to help the immediate family then what was the point of being a True Healer? And with that she had turned her back on him and motioned to Pequil to come forward, banishing Lanadan back to his chair.<br>
To Pequil, Lanadan’s voice was somewhat subdued, rather grave as he motioned to the desk behind him. Two scrolls had come for Illiysha that afternoon, to no one’s surprise as she was the Guild Lady of Qeynos, though the one with Tallik’s seal was opened by a white-knuckled Lanadan who told the people gathered in the sleeping room that Tallik, also, was ill and Mylissyl was doing what she could to keep things in perspective and moving. The illness was moving slowly through the city, and Tallik had not thought to protect himself from the sniffles, though when he collapsed while giving the daily assignments the whole Guild Hall had taken notice of what was happening to the city.<br>
Tallik’s scroll told of frustration, the absolute disbelief in things that were happening in the city. And, still, that the Healer Hall would not re-enter the city. They could not; it was pride, in some human sense, but it was also law now, that they would not enter. Indeed, people were flocking out of the city to their care by the hour, then drifting back into the city, past the guards who had orders to detain and wrap chains around the legs of any healers who attempted to enter the gates. Despite the fact that few knew the Lord of Freeport was dead and there was, in effect, no one to rule the city for a successor had not been chosen....and no one to repeal the writ against the Healer Hall of Freeport now.<br>
The second was from an unknown person, no doubt someone in the Guild Hall from the seal on the scroll and the haste with which it and Tallik’s had come to Qeynos. Whomever it was had reported that Mylissyl was also, at the time of writing, ill herself and that people were seeking their beds in the Guild Hall, as well as the city, faster than they could flee it to seek those with a healing touch outside it. <br>
The Lord of Qeynos was informed, in rather somber tones in a scroll, that Illiysha was ill, and that Lanadan felt he had no choice but to prevent anyone from further seeing his ill wife, save Pequil and Alamathea, until it was determined what was wrong with her, and what it was. Many were asking questions of her health, of what they could do to, perhaps, watch for the signs of this illness, and Lanadan had spoken what he knew.<br>
It had been a single sentence of information; if you felt ill, report it to Pequil or Alamathea.<br>
But that did not stop Illiysha from being ill, or people from beginning to be fearful and wanting to seek other shelter.<br>
Just before the evening meal, the Guild Hall of the Knights, Qeynos, was a somewhat somber place as those who remained within were wondering if they should have. Many had, in fear, gone to the homes of their Blood in the city, or had been told that there was no shame if they asked for duty elsewhere for a while. Lanadan had given the roster of places that Knights were required to be, and had sent out, for the first time he could recall, men and women to fill all the available open areas that were under his jurisdiction, as well as to trainings in Felwithe, Kaladim and the Outpost. Erudin already had its quota of Knights from all areas, thanks to Tiabrin’s memory, and asked no more sent there unless they were of exceptional note.<br>
Alamathea and Pequil forced Illiysha to drink what they could get her to take, forcing tea and warm liquids into her, broth from the meal she had been preparing and it was a moment’s laughter when Alamathea asked if the gigglers and those who remained in the Guild Hall had been fed...and all of them looked to Illiysha in that she was the ultimate timer on the serving of all meals.<br>
It made sense to leave Alamathea, as she was already exhausted from moving around the room tending to Illiysha and going down the several flights of stairs would probably do her in for longer than they could spare her. Pequil left her with Illiysha and a promise she would return soon with supplies of water, cloths and wrappings, taking Lanadan and Roderick with her to help with the meal. The twins girls that Illiysha was thrusting into any single male’s face of late were also summoned to help with the meal to be brought up the family quarters.<br>
When questioned if their mother would be joining them, Lanadan did not know what to say, other than not tonight.<br>
Roderick took it on himself to serve his sisters, Lanadan taking the reins of the Guild Hall and those that had remained to calm them as best he could with his presence. All total, much to his fears, only about three hundred had remained. This was the month when most were visiting their folk in the city or abroad, a traditional holiday for generations, and he was concerned that when they returned they would find the Guild Hall closed to them. Those whom he had sent abroad on assignments, with luck, would be safe, as well as reassure those they were going to assist.<br>
The conversation was somewhat somber, though he kept it going as best as he could, stating what he knew of Illiysha’s illness and answering what he could and that, to the relief of everyone, yes, Alamathea had remained in the Guild Hall. Though they were only a few streets from the Healer Hall, Lanadan was concerned for Alamathea’s health, and wished in hind sight that he had sought them for their advice on herbs and such things before his talented daughter-in-law had been summoned by Pequil. He worried for his wife, he was a bit more concerned for Alamathea’s life as she was a True Healer, and if there were truly something amiss here, they would need her skills and be hard-pressed if something were to happen to her. A pregnant, already overly-exhausted woman was not going to do them any good if she was too tired to care for herself, let alone help battle Illiysha’s illness and that of others.<br>
That Roderick’s wife was in the Guild Hall with them all seemed to soothe those who remained more than Lanadan’s presence, and he felt a moment’s spurt of jealousy that they were more concerned with her than he, their Guild Knight. But it was irrational, and he pushed it aside. Alamathea was the person they would want to seek first if something went amiss, and he told them all many times that if they felt the slightest feeling of ill, to speak to either she or Pequil of what was happening.<br>
One of the gigglers found him at dinner, skipping in as if nothing were wrong and looking up at him from the side of his chair mournfully until he patted her head. With some of his usual humor, he looked around the tables and asked if anyone had a bid to make on a young pair of idle hands and was met with laughter. The usual calls that the girl was a bit young, and that everyone knew Illiysha had already married them all off, it only took the dragging of the groom to the Lord of Qeynos to make it official. The laughter was a bit nervous at first, but reassuring at least in that they had not forgotten how to.<br>
The girl was happy to sit in her father’s lap and stare at those at the tables, waving as best she would, though Lanadan caught her arm and noted that she had bruises on it and chided her for not being more careful. She swore to him that they had appeared that morning without her bumping into anything and she was careful because she was in one of her good gowns that Illiysha let her wear when one of the unmarried ones was expected in the Guild Hall.<br>
He chided her for lying to him, setting her down with another pat to her head and told her to go tell her sisters that they were to clean the plates as always before they were brought down to the kitchens. Her look was a pert one at him, but she skipped off to the stairs she had come down, leaving Lanadan to deal with the usual jokes about whom Illiysha had the child dolled up for.<br>
She ascended the stairs, meeting Roderick coming down who promptly picked her up and brought her back up to the family quarters with a shake of his head. “Can’t keep an eye on you for more than half an hour without you wandering, can I?”<br>
They were all under his care, and even his sons were feeling the tension, though Dyrik and Laran were more complaining about the lack of their mother’s care than the tension around them. Roderick knew, at some point, he would need to take them to Alamathea, but despite the hour he was already sending them to change for bed and not taking any further discussion from the older ones who demanded to see their mother and they were not babies to be put to bed early. In that, he agreed with them, and sent them down with the dirty dishes to the kitchens to help with the cleanup of the meal.<br>
He tried not to chuckle too harshly at their complaints, grinning to himself that he had come up with such an easy way to get them out of his hair. Though the nanny that Illiysha had picked so long ago was more than eager to take them all under her wing, as well as Tial and Brind, admonishing the first that she was not going to carry him, and to the second that if he so much as looked cross-eyed at an ink pot he was going to be dumped into the nearest basin for a bath.<br>
Horror of horrors...even Roderick was smirking at her tone and left them to her care. Poor mites would be horrified forever of water he feared, but it would do them well for now.<br>
Pequil looked up as he came through the door, checking on Illiysha and curious as to Alamathea’s health also now, doubly concerned but knowing, despite all he wanted to do for her, that his wife would not leave Illiysha until she knew what was causing this. Even now, she was sitting on the bed beside Illiysha, holding her hand and squeezing it gently every now and then, her other hand touching the woman’s forehead and, on occasion, there was a flare along her hand, the skin glowing momentarily with a flare of magick that paled her face, but Illiysha looked less pale for a moment.<br>
He knew he should say something to her, stop her from healing his stepmother, but he knew to do so would probably bring about another war of words that neither of them would have the heart to engage in. And if she felt it was making a difference to Illiysha, perhaps it was something that needed to be done. So he took the seat across from the fire near Pequil, asking her what they knew so far about this illness, and if his father was acting prematurely.<br>
For Pequil, having seen many centuries, this was not something she had seen before. That people got the sniffles was a common occurance, but that people sought their beds due to it, fell in their kitchens, died from this...that she had nothing to comment on, as she did not know. She wished Waylar were here, but she feared that things would probably be worse if she left the Guild Hall to seek him out in Freeport now.<br>
Alamathea was resting against the wall, eyes closed and gathering her own strength, her fingers rubbing her belly unconsciously, as she had done in the times before with her sons before they had been born, and would not release Illiysha’s hand from her own. “She’s running a fever.”<br>
“Perhaps she’ll throw it off soon, and it’s just worry over what’s happening in Freeport.”<br>
“Perhaps,” Alamathea replied, opening her eyes slowly to Roderick and Pequil. “But whatever this is, it is fighting my healings, and it casts them off as if I’m not doing them.”<br>
“Even yours?”<br>
Her somber face nodded, and she looked to Roderick with more concern than he imagined she could show. That she was showing it frightened him, at last, as to what was happening in so short a time, and her face was nearly white, and he noted she was looking more exhausted than before he had gone to eat with the children. “We need to send scrolls to the other cities, and warn them to watch for this.”<br>
“Watch for what, love? We don’t even know what this is...she was bustling about most of the day until she collapsed. Everyone admits to seeing her at some point as they always do, and she never complained about the sniffles.”<br>
“Probably she never thought to protect herself from them,” Alamathea said, pushing the woman’s long, gray-black braid over her head rest and touching her fevered cheek. “But if she has it, Roderick, how many others do? And how are people coming into it?”<br>
To that, he had no answers, and found that Alamathea was pensive again, staring at the fire, eyes unfocused and then she shook her head and looked to Pequil. “It’s probably time to change the cloths again to keep her warm. Could you find some more cloths for us?” Roderick nodded to her, though the kiss he set against her forehead was more for her reassurance than his own. Had only four hours passed since Illiysha had fallen in the kitchen?<br>
The supplies Pequil had brought up had been quickly exhausted, as Alamathea had given a strange order and demanded they be burned in the fire grate as they were used. Pequil had given her a strange look, but had nodded after a moment and done as the younger woman asked. Roderick was off to find more, and Lanadan was off soothing concerned men and women below in the halls.<br>
When Roderick returned nearly an hour later with Lanadan, they found Pequil keeping vigil, and her finger to her lips, motioning to the bed. Illiysha was still feverish, Alamathea asleep beside her, clutching the woman’s hand still and there was a triumphant look from Pequil. “Pity she didn’t question my passing her the tea, and she didn’t smell it beforehand.”<br>
“That won’t hurt the babies?”<br>
Pequil’s dark eyes looked to Roderick, then to Lanadan, with all seriousness. “If she doesn’t lose them from exhaustion, I’m not certain if she’ll be able to birth them easily if she’s this exhausted when the time comes. She has to get her strength back.”<br>
“It’s not her nature to leave someone ill, Peekie.”<br>
She smiled to that, touching Roderick’s hand and pushing him Alamathea’s own cup. “It’s nothing more than a few herbs we use with the children when they have colic, Roderick. She’ll sleep a few hours and wake somewhat refreshed, though she may sleep longer than I want her to due to she needs it.”<br>
Lanadan put down the supplies he had brought up, raising an eyebrow as Pequil took some of the old cloths and sent them to the flames. Pequil shrugged at that. “Alamathea asked it done, and at this moment I’d trust her judgement as it is, even exhausted as she is.”<br>
“A strange request....”<br>
Pequil watched them burning, then looked up with a shrug. “Who can say what she truly understands. Do any of us undertand when we come into our magick, she more than others because of what she’s become? And how much of what she’s doing is residue from the spell that brought her back?”<br>
Roderick was staring down at Illiysha and his sleeping wife, touching her hair gently and startled when her hand closed over his. “You need to rest, love.” To that, Alamathea shook her head, rubbing her eyes and sitting up slowly, looking around with confusion.<br>
There was no hesitation; Roderick took her into his arms and took her from the room, which Lanadan closed once again and took the seat Pequil had vacated. “Will she sleep?”<br>
“Perhaps he can see that she sleeps for a while.”<br>
“We fed the twins...I can’t ever seem to remember babies being that...sloppy.”<br>
There was a slight noise of what might have been stifled laughter, and Lanadan smiled at the Teir`Dal. “Babies are always sloppy, Lanadan, when away from their mothers. Waylar can attest to my leaving the room and every one of the children flashing him a delighted, oh so warm smile and needing their wrapping changed, despite perhaps being changed just before the door closed behind me.”<br>
They shared a moment, looking to Illiysha as she slept restlessly.<br>
“She’s not going to keep the twins much longer, is she?”<br>
Pequil was touching Illiysha’s face and gently patting it with a damp cloth. “You have other matters now, Lanadan.”<br>
“That concerns me because if it happens, morale’s going to be lower than your own quarters below the city. They revere her, and to watch her demoralized...”<br>
“Women loose babies often, Lanadan,” she said, touching his hand with her own. “If it happens, there is nothing you can do about it. She knew the risks of quickening so close after a birthing, as well as every woman knows the risks of simply bearing. But right now, you must care for her,” she said, taking his hand and laying on Illiysha’s arm. “She needs you now more than your precious daughter-in-law the True Healer. Alamathea’s husband will take care of her...it’s Illiysha’s husband I need now to help me with her illness.”<br>
It might have been the heat of the room that made Lanadan rub at an eye, and then he gave a deep sigh and took up the small bowl of cool water from the window and brought some dry cloths over to Pequil.<br>
“And now, we wait,” Pequil said softly, taking another cloth from Lanadan and giving him the few others to the flames.<br>
<br>
<br>
Before the first roosters were crowing down near the egg pens, the Lord of Qeynos was already seeing to the matter of a spreading illness. Two messengers in his own court had taken ill the previous day, having fallen to the same momentarily fainting that had taken Illiysha. By the first signs of stirring at the docks of the city, four more were officially known to have taken ill, and another dozen more perhaps ill, perhaps not, but taking to their beds in any case.<br>
Upon sending to the Guild Hall for the True Healer, he was informed she was unavilable...a rather strange thing to say to one’s city liege, however, when confronted with Lanadan and Pequil, the Lord of Qeynos withdrew and took Lanadan with him instead to investigate the illnesses in his own domain. Pequil remained...not for the obvious reason of she did not enjoy travelling in the city proper because of her skin...but for the fact that Alamathea was ill herself from exhaustion and Illiysha was still feverish, and someone had to keep the pair of them.<br>
Mid-morning saw the first of the usual stream of boats from Odus, Chathak’s long lines of seed, supplies and young men and women coming as they always did early in the morning, and boats heading back there with supplies and scrolls of their own. The Lord of Qeynos held one particular boat for a message for Chathak himself, with Lanadan’s seal upon it, to be read by Chathak himself and not a scribe.<br>
But what did they say? Illiysha was ill from something they knew not what? Alamathea was in a drugged sleep to help her regain her own strength that the twins were taking from her? And Freeport was in a worse mess as there was no longer any scrolls from that city. Several hours waiting had produced no runners from there, nothing, and the Lord of Qeynos and Lord Lanadan stood on the ramparts, watching the hills for the morning runners and seeing nothing but the usual activites of planting and people moving here and there.<br>
Pequil ordered Roderick out of her sight near noon, locking the door behind her and in a near rage, taking Illiysha’s eldest twins into the room with her and the one Healer she had been able to wheedle out of the Healer Halls. In the room, what happened with both Illiysha and Alamathea was anyone’s speculation, though one of the twins was often seen releasing a bird on occasion with a note tied to its leg. Pequil had gone beyond the route of human messengers and knew what was happening was quickly growing out of her control.<br>
By mid-afternoon, eleven more cases, including one who had fallen into the harbor and had to be fished out before he drowned, had been identified, as well as another nearly twenty who were either ill of the sniffles or something else. One of Illisyha and Lanadan’s own was also ill, having been complaining of bruises during the week and barely able to get out of her own bed come morning. She was brought up into her mother’s quarters in mid-afternoon by Pequil herself, whose only comment to Lanadan, Roderick, and the others standing outside the room was to let her pass and let her do her duty.<br>
The evening meal saw a growing dread forming around the circles of Qeynos’s both upper and lower quarters, and birds continued to come and go from the upper windows of Lanadan and Illiysha’s living quarters throughout the afternoon into the evening from the room. With the assistance of a wizard unafraid of the threat, or perhaps not told, no one was ever quite certain either way, Waylar sent his son, Arton, and another Teir`Dal up to Qeynos, along with Arton’s young son with strict instructions to keep Kerlin with the gaggle of gigglers and OUT of Arton’s way.<br>
Pequil only shook her head, until she saw Arton, Firatha, and Kerlin appear with the elven wizard, her son’s robes a motley of bright yellows, oranges and reds with just a hint of green along some of the sigils on the right hemline.<br>
Definitely not becoming of a Child of Darkness....though Kerlin toddled over and was very adamant that Gamma note what a lovely job he had done to his father’s robes to brighten his father’s day. Gamma, also known as Pequil, regarded her stiff-faced son, her fellow Teir`Dal, and Kerlin, as well as the Lord of Qeynos, to whom some messages were for, and then Lanadan, and knew that if a minute hint of laughter appeared on her face she would probably be blasted by a spell from her own son.<br>
In the tradition of all Gammas, Pequil gave her grandson a well-deserved pat on the head, a kiss on that same head, and a rather bear of a hug, saying it was a very lovely job indeed and that her son had needed some sunny colors in his musty old bookshop.<br>
Arton’s sneer as she turned from him was reflected in her trying not to laugh, and passing Kerlin to Lanadan, who was also having a bit of a time facing Arton and keeping a rather dignified position, and the Lord of Qeynos himself was also looking about at anything but the man in the multi-colored robes.<br>
The very short, robed figure beside Arton, however, was darting all around, hidden beneath her cowl, though the Lord of Qeynos had had many years of dealing with Pequil not to be wholly prejudiced against Teir`Dal...at least, not as the Lord of Freeport was, who dealt with them on a daily basis. Arton took hold of her gloved hand and made the introductions for himself and Firatha to the Lord of Qeynos, who was more and overjoyed at seeing Arton again as they had been in several sessions in the past for tutoring and seminars. Firatha was obviously nervous, though when the Lord of Qeynos took her hand to his forehead, as a gesture of welcome, she fought the visible urge to flee in terror.<br>
Kerlin was also very delighted to be in a new place, with many, many sights to explore and many, many more things to get into trouble with, though Firatha took him at her side when Pequil needed to set him down because of his squirming. She also noted that Arton was desperately too protective of the girl and simply needed to do something soon before Kerlin said something and startled them all, as children often do. But Kerlin stopped most of his fussing as he held Firatha’s hand and watched all the happenings around him with substantial, two-year-old awe.<br>
That is, until Lanadan brought Tial and Brind out of the Guild Hall with him, who were more than delighted to have another boy to play with.<br>
The walk back to the Guild Hall, however, was met with more than one dire look, and Pequil and Lanadan were confronted with two more cases of the illness, one of them having fallen simply dead on their way to morning practice. And one of the twins, Pequil could never tell which, was waiting for her at the door, saying that Roderick had gotten into the room and was in a rather heated argument with Alamathea about her health.<br>
A communal sigh, and Pequil, Lanadan, and the Lord of Qeynos looked to Arton and Firatha. Pequil left them to go up to the rooms again, and Lanadan brought the newcomers into the Guild Hall to oversee the caring of the body as well as if there were any others who felt ill. The Lord of Qeynos offered what he could, and Firatha, they all noted, kept a firm control on the three boys as if she were their mother and not a watcher.<br>
It was a stiff-legged Roderick who stomped down the stairs, soaked from hair to booted heels and smelling of a floral fragrance and mumbling something under his breath as he headed to the communal baths. The scent was one Alamathea’s favorites, and it had been a rather large bottle of scent to last her quite a very long time. He dared anyone to say a word, then looked at Arton’s robe and tossed a towel at him. “Baths are this way, WITHOUT WOMEN,” he snarled, stomping off with his own towel and a fresh change of clothing and Arton tried not to chuckle.<br>
“Ahh...I believe I need to freshen up myself.”<br>
“Please do,” Lanadan tried to say with a straight face, though Firatha was staring at Roderick with obvious horror, then looked up to Arton after smelling the air deeply.<br>
“Wasn’t that a lady’s scent he was wearing? And why was he wearing it and not with a lady?”<br>
A moment’s horrified silence...and there was no holding back the laughter. People were ill, some were dying, Freeport was in a chaos none of them knew about as yet, Qeynos was feeling the first pangs of the disease, the Guild Lady was ill, the True Healer was ill and dangerously pregnant...and they all shook with laughter.<br>
It was all they could do when the word came that evening that Freeport had no Law, people were running rampant and that now even the Healers were falling ill.<br>
And the fifth recorded death from the illness claimed Illiysha and Lanadan’s daughter...the sixth was the Lady of Qeynos who fell dead of the strange illness walking her children along the waterfront as she always did.<br>
<br>
