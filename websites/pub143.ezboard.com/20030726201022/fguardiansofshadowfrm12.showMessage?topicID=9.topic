General Roderick Peacekeeper's so-called abduction of Lady Alamathea Hopeseeker, Daughter of Lord Antonanth Hopeseeker of Freeport, had, indeed, brought all of the Guild home to their respective Halls...<br>
And the Charges, when laid wide open by Lord Antonanth himself, had split the Guild apart.<br>
Roderick's own Sire, Lanadan Peacekeeper of Qeynos and current holder of the Lady's Key, as well as the ruling Knight of Qeynos Guild Hall, had been summoned even despite the attack on his own city. A trustworthy wizard had been summoned from the tower and sent him to Freeport to meet the Charges, and his son, and determine blame, if any, truly existed.<br>
For Roderick, there was no greater shame than returning to Freeport, ringed by seven Dwarven guards, Tallik on one side and Lady Alamathea leading them towards the gates.<br>
Of the young girl he had once watched growing in the shelter of the library, there was nothing left but a raging woman, walking with determined steps far in front of them to stop at the gates of Freeport, staring at the Guild representatives.<br>
It was noted that her own Sire was not present, but waiting in the Guild Hall for her.<br>
Faces that only eight days earlier had been concerned for her welfare were now sympathetic, overjoyed to see her, and Roderick hoped, for her Name and her safety, she would keep her silence.<br>
Then again, he, too, had once been young...and a dreamer of heart.<br>
Her arguments began in front of Lord Narson, who took her by the arm, gentle, aged words soothing her, but she would not be placated. Her fingers were pointing back to Roderick, to the wounds on her neck still un-healed, to the three random men she had chosen to come with her who had been with Roderick since leaving Freeport, and had not spoken to him since that morning in Felwithe...which was now Freeport's morning half a world away.<br>
Lord Narson took her into the city, welcoming Roderick with a look of pity that the younger man knew meant things were dire indeed.<br>
When one was Charged with something, it was customary, required, for them to be met by their accuser at the gates of the city. Lord Antonanth was waiting in the Guild Hall, which meant that he was foregoing any courtesies to the city's officials, as well as to his own brethren Knights.<br>
The Guild Hall was lit up, every window seemingly having someone hanging from it with several guests or simply the faces, the multitude of faces staring at him. He felt a deep shame, not so much for himself, but for Tallik, his three men, and for the young woman raising the stormclouds ahead of him with Lord Narson's ears. They would be the ones, if he was found guilty some how, to bear the burdens of the aftermath.<br>
The Guild Hall was simply that, a warrens of rooms, teaching studios, training areas, sparring quarters, barracks, and, above it all, the large Prayer Hall, where nearly four hundred could be seated at one time, or several hundred standing.<br>
Roderick noted that there was not even standing room left, and the Hall was in dire condition indeed.<br>
He saw people with whom he had fought battles with, investigated matters, helped through trials and taught swordplay and the rigors of study. Their faces were on his left. Those on the right he did not recognize, though there were often many in and out of the Guild Hall whom he did not know by name.<br>
Lady Alamathea took several steps from Lord Narson, leaving the elderly man behind her to stare up at the raised chairs, nine in all, and to the man standing, staring down at she and Lord Narson.<br>
His arms were outstretched to her, welcoming her home, and he came down the steps to embrace her, holding her tightly as if she had been gone years and not days.<br>
Alamathea, pulling away from her sire, stared at him with the ruthless glare of the very young. &quot;You have accused Roderick of my abduction? What judgement is this?&quot;<br>
Lord Antonanth took her arm, leading her to a seat, obviously reserved for her, to which she dug in her heels to the stones beneath her steel-booted feet. &quot;You will explain to me why you have accused him of a falsehood! And now! I was not taken by him from the sands near the oasis, I was taken by a being without a name!&quot;<br>
Lord Antonanth looked beyond his daughter, to Tallik and the three men, being brought forward. To Roderick, with the guards still around him, being led to the center of the open area and staring at the man.<br>
Graying hair was a sign of becoming elder, though Lord Antonanth had none on his head, nor were his eyes anything but aged. Long had he been known for keeping his youthful appearance, as well as appearances with those whom he needed the most. He was well known for charming stubbornness and harder political foes, and his swordarm, if not growing a bit wiry, was still true, or so it was said.<br>
His look upon Roderick now could only be taken for pure malice...rage and anger directed at a human foe.<br>
The look turned to a melting smile, to which he turned to his daughter. &quot;I have received proof that you were led out of the city, to be taken hostage for a ransom, and that one of our own was the instigator.&quot;<br>
Her eyes were flashing a dark look of rage back in his direction. &quot;Your proof consists of bringing us back when Felwithe needed us, as did Kaladim, and we hadn't even scouted into the ruins to search for survivors of Kelethin.&quot;<br>
&quot;You were hurt?&quot; He took in her burned hair, her bloodstained fingers, her dented armor and his look turned to one of concern.<br>
Her head shook, slowly, motioning to Roderick. &quot;They found me in the castle and helped me escape.&quot; What more was there to say that was not on record in the Guild Hall in Kaladim now? She did not want to bring up the knowledge that she had no memory of what had truly happened after her abduction. It was a blank, a haze of blackness she could not penetrate even through the most silent of meditations.<br>
&quot;They were paid to find you there.&quot;<br>
&quot;They were sent there,&quot; she corrected him, &quot;By your wizard, whom I'm told did not send you with them to search for me.&quot;<br>
&quot;We searched the sands and found nothing but your glove.&quot;<br>
She pointed to Tallik. &quot;HE found the glove...you were given it...&quot;<br>
&quot;Who has been corrupting you with lies?&quot; Alamathea's wince at Lord Antonanth's tone was, if anything, visible even to those who were further back and could understand nothing being said.<br>
The booming voice of a father to a child, long the scourge of any youngster trying to make a parent see reason for an idea or a cause...it was a tone and words made to end the matter.<br>
Lady Alamathea stared at Lord Antonanth, afraid suddenly of something she could not name. There was a strange feeling on her throat and she reached up to itch the wounds, only to find they were bleeding down her throat.<br>
&quot;No one has been corrupting me with lies...other than I wish to know why you sent them, without yourself, and did not attempt to follow? Why weren't you with them when they found me? Why did you remain here?&quot;<br>
&quot;Enough.&quot; Lord Antonanth's hands cut through the air, and he turned to Roderick.<br>
The hand that turned him, forcefully, was not expected.<br>
&quot;You'll answer me, as I am due one. You let them be 'ported out, and did not go with them?&quot;<br>
&quot;Take her out,&quot; was all she was hearing, two guards on either side of her and she looked to them with more irritation.<br>
&quot;Silencing me so that I won't know the answers?&quot;<br>
&quot;You ask things that have no bearing on what is to happen! Roderick Peacekeeper of Qeynos stands accused of your abduction.&quot;<br>
&quot;It was Roderick who found me in the castle...who took me to Kaladim after our escape and gave me to Shesa Rubblewalker. It was Roderick who was questioned by the Guild Council in Kaladim as to what had happened to me, and it was Roderick's men who were questioned, one by one, to determine any falsities of this.&quot;<br>
Her voice continued, clear and hard, cold. &quot;Roderick was one of the first to leave Kaladim when the messengers went out that Felwithe was burning, and he came to assist how he could, as a Knight must. His hands were burned as the rest of ours were, and when Faydark burned, he was the one who led us inside to be safe. He organized the movement of the injured to Kaladim, and was about to move the third group out when your Charges were laid against him.<br>
&quot;If you have proof that he was the one who abducted me, killed four of his own men to do so, took his own battalion into an unknown area, loosing more to come to a castle unknown and a host dire, rescuing me and taking me to Kaladim for safety...then I will hear it now, as a Child of the Guild...I will hear the proof now.<br>
&quot;I call Witness, and I demand it.&quot;<br>
It was seldom done...and often times the downfall to many a political move or investigation. Witness was simply that...the person accusing another had to bring forth undeniable proof of guilt, of treason, with five witnesses and all the documentation that could be uncovered.<br>
Lady Alamathea stood, breathing steady and her eyes never leaving her sire's.<br>
&quot;You are too young to call Witness...&quot;<br>
&quot;I am a Child of the Guild, Rodcet's Own, and have the right to this. I call Witness and demand it now.&quot;<br>
Lord Antonanth looked to Lord Narson, who was, strangely now, looking to him.<br>
Lord Narson was nearing his mid seventies, having led a healthy, long life of battles and children and training and teaching. He had allowed the Charges to be filed...though even the Guild Hall had run with how quickly they had been uncovered.<br>
His aged, wrinkled hands moved slowly, but his eyes were still strong. &quot;Let Witness be Called and brought forth,&quot; he said.<br>
Lord Antonanth's calm facade dropped slightly, but for a moment, Lord Narson moving past him to take his seat once again in the middle of the others and await the hearing.<br>
His gaze followed Lord Narson's...to his own daughter. &quot;Do you, calling Witness, have enough for your stand?&quot;<br>
She nodded, pointing to Tallik, the three men and then herself. &quot;We represent the required five for Witness.&quot;<br>
&quot;Speak then, and let us hear your words.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
------------------------<br>
<br>
Confined to his quarters after having listened to nearly four hours worth of testimony, questioning, examining armor, wounds, having others brought in from Kaladim as they could be found, Roderick was not certain if he wanted to sleep, or if he should.<br>
Lord Narson was a canny man, knowing campaigns could be won or lost by a single motion, a word, a cloud in the sky, and how to best plan on the victory through the fire. He had questioned Tallik first, then the three men, ending with Lady Alamathea herself, who had stepped down to be the first to be questioned.<br>
He had watched his own men struggling against their beliefs that he was innocent, trying to make certain everything they said, they had done, was spoken and what few wrongs there had been were noted.<br>
Tallik had been curt and answering what he was asked, giving little else to Lord Antonanth, but answering steadily to Lord Narson. He was Roderick's sub-commander, and, hence, his own duties of the battalion stood on the block, for if Roderick were charged with the accusation, Tallik would find himself the new general.<br>
And then there was Lady Alamathea.<br>
Roderick tried to close his eyes again, but sleep would not come. There were too many voices swimming in his head, too many questions he had to answer and could not. Too many things that were happening too quickly for him to sort through.<br>
He was not surprised at the door opening after a slight knock, expecting the knock, as he knew her too well, but coming to his feet to see his Sire, Lanadan, along with Lady Alamathea.<br>
The look on her face was anything but revealing, and he wondered how long she had been working on that blank, mask-like expression. <br>
His own Sire's was one of barely concealed rage, but Roderick offered him a chair. He deferred, giving it to Alamathea, who took it with all the courtesy of her rank and sat between them. Only then did Lanadan take a seat on the armor bunk, Roderick sitting down on the bed again to watch them.<br>
His Sire looked old...hair finally having turned a silvery-white, his blue eyes taking in the room with its sparce decor and hangings. Indeed, most of what was in it consisted of armor, weapons training tomes, diagrams from past battles to be studied, and tubes and tubes of old scrolls and new.<br>
&quot;You are to be asked to leave the city....until the Charges are fully investigated...and I need you in Qeynos.&quot;<br>
&quot;What's happened?&quot;<br>
Lanadan shook his head to that. &quot;Qeynos came under seige by an army of dark elves, who didn't succeed in entering the city, but came rather close.&quot;<br>
&quot;How?&quot;<br>
&quot;Ships...we thought they were the grain shipment we expect on a weekly basis. There were four of them, loaded to the decks with them. They got two ships unloaded before we blew the other two, and sank most of the docks where we'd driven them.&quot; Lanadan had to laugh to himself, looking to Roderick and Alamathea with amusement. &quot;I do believe it the first, and probably last, time that the Necromancer's Guild...which doesn't exist, of course,&quot; he smiled to Alamathea's concerned look. &quot;I believe it was the first and only time they assisted us in city matters.&quot;<br>
Alamathea was no stranger to what lay beneath the city. She knew the tales, as did any Guild Hall dweller...the lower areas of the Guild Halls contained nothing of value, only the dining areas, gathering halls for morning prayers and shared information with other Halls such as the mages, druids and so forth.<br>
It was too easy for one to cut a hole through the stones, create another sewer opening, and raid things. She knew the tales, and said nothing. Freeport had its own dark arts children, and she hoped she would never have to encounter one. Taking the life of another was unbearable enough without having to do so to another living being who did so to others.<br>
&quot;Is the city alright?&quot;<br>
&quot;It's survived, though we're short on supplies right now, and good humor.&quot;<br>
&quot;So I'm to be sent home...until they decide?&quot;<br>
Lanadan looked to Alamathea, who was staring at her hands in her lap, saying nothing. She who had long had an interest in his room, for reasons known only to her, was finally here, and looking at nothing but her hands.<br>
&quot;It would be best if you came home to Qeynos until this is decided, as I can use your wits. And matters here seem...touchy at the immediate moment.&quot;<br>
That brought a flinch from the young woman, but nothing more, and Roderick looked to his sire, who shook his head warningly. The door was left open also, the two guards and a witness to the conversation watching and listening.<br>
&quot;When do we leave?&quot;<br>
&quot;Now,&quot; Lanadan said, looking at Alamathea, who finally lifted her head, nodding slightly at the floor and then standing again to move to the doorway.<br>
Tallik was there, as were his three men, and Roderick gave each of them a look of both gratitude and fear. If they were to come with him, if he was found guilty, they were all doomed to the Guild Halls now. But they had obviously made their choice when they came to his room, and he thanked them with his eyes for it.<br>
&quot;How are we returning to the city?&quot;<br>
&quot;There is a wizard waiting on us.&quot;<br>
Roderick's Sire helped him gather up his armor, what few possessions he felt he would need. The room, he locked himself behind him, and broke the key in the lock to assure that no one would enter. The guards glared at him for doing so, but he only smiled at them. He had seen charges before bring out the worst of a man's past, things that none should know of privacy and lovers. He was not about to fall into that trap, even if he had nothing to hide.<br>
Lady Alamathea was silent, however, which unnerved him, but Tallik was whispering that Lord Antonanth seemed to have some information that he was not divulging as yet, but promised that Roderick was guilty.<br>
Lord Narson stood waiting for them beside a robed caster, taking Lord Laradan's arm once again in a firm handshake and promising a swift end to the whole matter, good or bad, and trying to be of good cheer. Lord Laradan, understanding there were ears and eyes nearby, as also knowing politics as he did, did the same and wished him well.<br>
They stepped back from Lord Narson, and it was then that Roderick noticed Alamathea was not with them, but standing off near the wall, watching them in silence. He motioned his sire and the men away for a moment, coming to stand in front of her.<br>
&quot;You have something to say to me.&quot;<br>
Her eyes looked to him, her head shaking very slowly. He noticed she had been crying, and there was a bruise rising on her cheek as if she had been struck. &quot;There is nothing left to say until they decide.&quot;<br>
&quot;What will you do while I'm gone?&quot;<br>
To that, she gave a shrug. &quot;They have other assignments that I was due to perform after I returned from the desert, but now it seems as if Sire has other plans for me.&quot;<br>
&quot;Other plans?&quot;<br>
She nodded, avoiding his eyes.<br>
&quot;What do these other plans involve? Teaching? Training others to heal, perhaps?&quot;<br>
She shook her head, tears beginning again and looking away from him, to Lord Narson and then away again to Roderick. &quot;They will find you guilty...and you will not be allowed to return.&quot;<br>
He moved closer, staring down at her. &quot;How do you know this?&quot;<br>
&quot;It is politics...if you return, or attempt to, you will be hanged...or worse. You will be Banished from the Guild Halls when they are finished investigating.&quot;<br>
&quot;Who?&quot;<br>
She winced at his tone, fingers gripping into her palms and drawing blood there on the left one. He wanted to reach for it, stare at the injury and he could only stand at a distance and stare down at her. &quot;What is being done to you?&quot;<br>
The wounds on her neck were bleeding freely again, he noted, as they had not done since her arrival in Kaladim. But her voice was unsteady, cracking and rising with hysteria as she spoke.<br>
&quot;An Alliance for your guilt...&quot;<br>
He needed to know no more, closing his eyes and opening them slowly. Alliances, for a male, were simply one more reason to be out in the Field as often as you could, or in the Guild Halls. Alliances were marriages on convenience and higher ranking within a city. A man could have several Alliances in a city without breaking the true bonds of his original Vows to his first wife. Many did, in multiple cities, that knew knew of in Freeport alone.<br>
Alliances for a woman...there was nothing in an Alliance that gave a woman a chance to speak up if she wished it or not.<br>
&quot;Who,&quot; he demanded in a voice not his own. He wanted to touch her, just for a moment, to soothe her fears, wipe her eyes and tell her it would be alright, if she could just be quiet for a moment. But the bruise on her face told him otherwise, and he knew there were men in the city who would not see above beating one of their own because they were of their seed than doing so to a servant.<br>
&quot;Lord Narson,&quot; she whispered between sobs, and Roderick sighed. Lord Narson, a patriarch of them all whom they had all seen as above the city's politics, above the treachery and the backfighting, the scowling faces.<br>
Lord Antonanth was giving his daughter to a man in his seventies, to win his ruling against Roderick.<br>
He had no doubt she believed her world had come to an end, for as the Guild's Lady, she would forever be in charge of the supervision of the hall and all its doings. It was a hand-in-hand duty with whomever had the duties of Guild Knight...Roderick's own Sire and his present mother had been doing so jointly for many, many years now.<br>
It would kill her, being contained in a city. She was not one to be content with just playing maid to the constant flow of young people into the Guild Halls and their ranks, and the outflowing of those going into the Field for testing as well as leaving the world ultimately in spirit. She was young, young enough to still feel the wanderlust of wanting to know, needing to search and scout and scour for one object or another that simply must be found.<br>
Roderick turned from her abruptly, for there was nothing he could say, or do. What his Sire knew, he dared not ask in front of Lord Narson, but if Alamathea knew, then it was already a probable deal, with the scrolls just waiting to go out the moment he was 'ported to Qeynos.<br>
Qeynos knew him, knew his actions, and they long knew he would, in all likelihood, assume the title of Guild Knight when Lord Lanadan stepped down, if he ever did and death took him first. None of his other sons had wanted it, and Roderick had been groomed for it for many, many years without his ever knowing it.<br>
He realized it now, afraid of finally seeing why his Sire had wanted him to know all aspects of ruling...but this? He was returning home in disgrace...banished from Freeport, ready to be 'ported back to his home with his Sire and his trusted men.<br>
Leaving behind a weeping young woman, who would probably die not long after she was wedded. Lord Narson would be fair to her...but Lady Alamathea was not one to be caged for long before confinement killed her by her own hands.<br>
He looked to Tallik, the pair knowing one another of old, then to the wizard and his sub-commander's eyes widened in alarm, but he would obey. He looked to the wizard, beginning to speak something, and Roderick approached slowly, leading Alamathea, as if bringing her back to Lord Narson for safekeeping.<br>
The spell began to cast, and Roderick heard Tallik suddenly give a gasp, pointing to something behind them all. As one, they all turned, Lord Narson turning fully to stare at whatever it was that had been pointed at.<br>
The wizard, his silver-gold hair gleaming in the light, only smiled. Lady Alamathea stared at Roderick, gripping his hand tightly as the magick surged, sending eight of them to Qeynos, into the darkness of full night and second watch.<br>
Lord Lanadan's shock at finding themselves in Qeynos, Lady Alamathea clutching the hand of his own son, was more than enough. The look on her face, the bruise, he knew had come from when her sire had struck her several times for speaking to the Council.<br>
Her silent words, the tears in her eyes as she stood beside Roderick, whose quiet tones asked her to repeat what she had learned, burned into his belly as no sword could have.<br>
&quot;You are to be Banished? For an Alliance? What treachery is this?&quot;<br>
She was apologizing, over and over saying she was sorry to them all, and Roderick had an arm around her shoulders at last to calm her, Tallik and one of the younger men trying to explain that she had not been the one to do this to them, they had all come of their free will.<br>
Only Roderick understood, as perhaps, in a younger age, his own Sire would have, who was staring at him now with a knowing expression, and a deeper sigh of resignation.<br>
To Roderick, Lord Lanadan's eyes came to rest. &quot;Qeynos will be searched, you realize? Until she is found? The Charges, now, are true charges of abduction.&quot;<br>
She shook her head, the horror of her own actions coming forth and she was white, but Roderick was shaking his head. &quot;She is to be sent back...I can't have her involved.&quot;<br>
Her own voice was countermanding his words. &quot;If you stay, I stay. I won't return...I'll sooner run back to Felwithe and find the dark elves before they make me return.&quot;<br>
He clamped a hand over her mouth, as if she'd cursed, which for now it was for all they knew. &quot;Never again repeat that...we do not need to remember that now.&quot;<br>
&quot;Have the wizard bring her back,&quot; Tallik suggested, the seven of them staring around at one another and nodding.<br>
But of the wizard...there was no sign. He had been beside Lord Lanadan and the youngest of the three men...there was no one there now, and if he had moved, they would certainly have seen him.<br>
It was only then that Tallik, and Roderick, stared at one another. &quot;Was that....&quot;<br>
&quot;He had the hair...&quot;<br>
&quot;Eyes dark and glowing...&quot;<br>
They looked to Lord Lanadan, concerned. &quot;We were just 'ported here by the same man who originally ported us to the Faydwer.&quot;<br>
&quot;HIM?!&quot; Lord Lanadan's voice rang along the stones, turning to stare at the gates of the city where they had arrived and frowning. &quot;How?&quot;<br>
&quot;I don't know how...but someone, obviously, is one step ahead of us in anticpating what we're going to be doing.&quot; Between his scarred fingers, Lady Alamathea's hand was warm, shivering from fear and regret, but warm. He did not want to release it.<br>
From one of the upper areas, the voices were ringing out. His own younger siblings, the eldest of this particular bunch just nearing the teens, and suitable marriage ages, and they were all racing down the stairs towards their Sire and brother.<br>
Roderick looked to Alamathea, the fright in her face as she stared at the gates of Qeynos and then up at him. The regret of what she had done...that someone had manipulated her into making the Charges reality, weighed upon her expression. He could not recall seeing her face as ashen as it was now.<br>
Behind his siblings...there was his mother, to which he gave a groan as she came to stop, bustling with added weight and a shifting of dress hems.<br>
Her eyes, as always, were firstly for her husband, with whom she kissed his cheek and looked to Roderick...<br>
Staring at his hand, holding Lady Alamathea's, and then she regarded him with a widening smile.<br>
Behind him, Tallik began to groan.<br>
Sleep, again, would not come this night. Roderick could feel it in his bones.<br>
As was just as well, for when the attack came, he was well prepared with his armor and his weapons to help defend the city against it.<br>

It should take you, maybe 5 minutes.  If there is enough demand I can put a link to it up on our guild webspace (I have 10megs available for screen shots and the like or more if I want to host on my personal computer).<br>
