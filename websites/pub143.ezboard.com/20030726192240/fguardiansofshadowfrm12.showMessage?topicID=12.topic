&quot;You're sending me away,&quot; she had whispered to Roderick, eyes wide with fright and horror.<br>
His fingers had been gentle on her arm, and then on her hand. &quot;No, I'm not sending you away...you're going two streets north of here to another Guild Hall where you'll be safe. And perhaps someone will take the time to finally Train you in what has been neglected so far.&quot;<br>
&quot;Which is?&quot;<br>
&quot;Your healing skills.&quot;<br>
She had only stood at the gateway to the Healer Halls, staring at him with wide, hurt eyes and there had been nothing to say to her, nothing he could possibly say to make her feel any less betrayed.<br>
Two hours after leaving her in the safety of the healers of Rodcet Nife, they knew little more than they did when she had been there, but Roderick felt safer than before.<br>
One of his sisters, about Lady Alamathea's size, had been brought in to mimic that she was, truly, still in the Guild Hall and had not vanished. He worried for his sister, should an attack come, but he worried more for the young woman whom he had escorted, literally, out of his care in the Guild Halls into the care of another.<br>
Roderick detested when his feelings betrayed him in any matter, this one worst of all to date.<br>
Lanadan had brought in Belerak Rubblewalker from Kaladim once again, to testify before the Qeynos Lord and Lanadan's own Council over what had happened upon the arrival of Roderick in Kaladim. It was a recounting of much of what his son had already stated, and Belerak felt more shame at having to tell his equal that his own son had been chosen to bring Roderick back in shame.<br>
&quot;Betta we knew whats goin on n'sendin kin t'die.&quot;<br>
&quot;Better still we understood how far this betrayal goes.&quot;<br>
Belerak had left Shesa in charge of the Guild Halls in his absence. Fearing, still, more attacks as had felled Kelethin and Felwithe, Kaladim was still barring all visitors as well as forbidding any to leave its walls without magickal 'portaion. Daliea, it was said, had brought her wave of refugees to Kaladim and then gone back to search for her mate.<br>
To date, she had, as yet, not returned.<br>
Lanadan waited in personal agony, ticking off the hours until he knew the scrolls would reach their desinations. He had timed them that Kaladim, the Outpost and Highhold Keep would receive theirs first...there being a rather large number of Knights currently gathered in Highhold for a celebration of both age and marriage of two Noble Houses from Felwithe of all places...all gathered more than stunned that what had originally be scoffed at for being so far from their homes was now seen as salvation that they were alive at all.<br>
Of Freeport...that scroll would arrive last. It had been planned that way, and the young man deliving it was to have the Lord of Freeport in attendance when he delivered it to the Guild Hall. There needed to be some witnesses to the deed...at least, he hoped there would be.<br>
The reaction from the Outpost was instantaneous...fourteen druids 'ported into Qeynos' nearest neighboring city, Jaggedpine Forest and Surefall Glade, and made themselves available to Lord Lanadan's service. With them, they had the sealed scrolls of Yveaa, the Guild Knight of the Firiona Vie Outpost, with his promise that the druids had only to be asked, and they would take as many out of Qeynos to the safety of the Outpost...guild or otherwise.<br>
From Kaladim, Belerak was stunned to see one of the two elvish wizards, twins of a great age for their hair was the deep, burnished white of falling snow, and he knew them personally...one of them had been his own tutor in the ways of magick.<br>
One of them, it was never known which, was also now dead.<br>
Kaladim had offered both sword and stone to be raised against such a betrayer of the Knighthood. Whatever could be promised or asked would be done against such a foe as the Lord of Mistmoore...and Lord Antonanth Hopeseeker.<br>
The shock of a Noble House's Lord and a fellow Knight joined with the forces of evil was, in effect, racing faster through the Qeynos Guild Hall than Illiysha's desserts on the table. No one knew what to say, but all could look in some direction of Qeynos and see the devastation, the ruins of some of the great parts of the town, and see for themselves what was happening.<br>
The young Teir`Dal...of his fate, sadly, none truly knew what to do about him. Not a prisoner, though in some ways he was. Not a spy, for he had nothing to hide, nor any way to return to his lands other than a ruthless journey. And certainly he was not in collusion with the nameless wizard, still at large in Qeynos, whom Roderick and Lanadan, half the city it seemed wanted to know who he was, and where he was.<br>
It all came down to why...the whys were overwhelming. Why had Lord Antonanth sought a pact with darkness, when he himself was in line for the next Guild Knight position, then Lord Narson himself gave it up, or perished?<br>
It was the boy who finally pointed out the obvious.<br>
In a flurry of words and gestures, the Necromancer guarding him spoke up in hollow tones to Lord Lanadan.<br>
&quot;He asks if Lord Antonanth has aged lately.&quot;<br>
The answer was clear, suddenly...<br>
Eternal life.<br>
What other could have been promised than that?<br>
If he were Guild Knight of Freeport, it was a title that was handed on only after death...or debilitation. In rare instances did one step down from it, though one would be well cared for if they did. Most kept it until their death, their successor Named many years in advance and known to the Guild Halls. In the event of a sudden death, the Council voted on a successor.<br>
If Lord Antonanth was now, also, of the undead...in some way that he appeared human still and had fooled them all, he would be Guild Knight forever...long after all of them had gone to dust and sand in the gave.<br>
They spoke, those from Freeport, of knowing he was ageless to begin with, and fifty years would have given him considerable time to have built up such a network of spies, secret armies, diversions.<br>
Roderick himself took his sire and Tallik back to the Healers Halls of Rodcet Nife, seeking Lady Alamathea for more questions and answers that she, as a daughter, could provide.<br>
They were greeted, once again, by the Guild Healer, Jysyntal, a man of years and honor as Lord Laradan was, though devoted to healing, and nothing more.<br>
He took them to Lady Alamathea's assigned rooms. Knowing that all students do best in small rooms, for they, upon entering the Guild, had no personal possessions save their clothing, perhaps a book or two, and what few items they would need for learning, and knowing that Lady Alamathea was not a beginning student, he had given her one of the guest rooms for now. He knew she would be often attending guests as well as witnesses, and he had had the foresight to give her a rather large one, with two seperate rooms for guests to bed down in, as well as her own private sleeping room and bath.<br>
Of the Lady Alamathea...as usual, to rid herself of unwanted thinking, she had sent her nose into the nearest book, and this particular guest room was full of many, many fine books on healing.<br>
She had been searching for something so intently that she was presently dozing, her head to one side on an open book, breath even and her eyes closed tightly. She had neglected to even take off the cloak she had been brought in, such must have been her irritation...and her dismay at having been brought here.<br>
Roderick watched her sleeping, the urge to send her to her bed and be with her warring, as it always seemed to be lately, with the need to have her awake and answering the endless questions that seemed to be streaming behind her like ribbons in her hair.<br>
Illiysha had no compunctions that neither Lady Alamathea, nor Roderick, had slept much over the past few days, and her hand was gentle, as was her voice, but she was insistent the young woman wake and answer some more questions.<br>
She was a heavy sleeper on her own, Illiysha having to nearly sit her back into the chair to wake her from slumber and only then brushing back hair from her eyes that had fallen there, soothing her suddenly raw nerves and pointing to Lanadan and Jysyntal and then saying more questions were needed answers to.<br>
Her voice was weary...even Roderick could hear it, knowing her reserves of strength and energy that they all took during battle and healing. But she was tired, as was he, as were they all, nor would there be sleep coming anytime soon.<br>
Lady Alamathea tried to remember the last time she had seen her sire aging, were there any old portraits of him from her birthing, perhaps those of her elder siblings? Reminding her that, somehow, she was the last child alive, brought a pursing of her lips and even Roderick felt her pain. He had not even considered looking at the Death Lists to see how many of her siblings had gone to their deaths.<br>
More questions, more answers needed. Had Lord Antonanth entertained guests, and if so when, and how many? Did she remember what they spoke of, how long they spoke, perhaps how long they remained in the guest rooms of her family's House in Freeport? There seemed to be no ending, for once one was answered, three more questions came up into the fray to be asked.<br>
Illiysha was the one to finally call a end to them, her patience worn thin by even some of the most trivial details, and knowing some questions had been asked of Lady Alamathea before. For justification of her innocence, they were asked again now and then, and Illiysha had finally had enough of the whole matter. The young woman was obviously exhausted, her son was about to fall before them all, and she was tired watching the pair of them try to keep awake.<br>
Off they marched, out off Lady Alamathea's quarters, though Jysyntal offered them the hospitalities of other guest quarters. Lanadan refused, though he ordered his wife, son, Tallik and two others to sleep while they could. He left with Jysyntal and the Necromancers who had come in the middle of the session to add their questions.<br>
Illiysha took the other room, Roderick and Tallik offered other quarters with the men, though Tallik was dismissed into one of them, Roderick taking the other empty guest room off of Lady Alamathea's personal study room. He wanted to ensure she slept...which they all did...even with Jysyntal's healing assistance, Lady Alamathea slept the rest of the day, a night and a third of a day away. Roderick himself the same, though Illiysha woke him briefly to ensure he wasn't dead from some pestilence or something. She blamed Lanadan for making all of his children sleep as the dead.<br>
Upon waking, for there was much still to do, Roderick found that matters had been moving of their own accord towards a showdown between the Guild and Lord Antonanth. Scrolls had finally reached Freeport, and the messenger had been given an audience with the Lord of Freeport. Escorted to the Guild Hall with the man, Lord Narson had listened as the Charges against Lord Antonanth of Freeport were listed out, one by one, and the blasphemy that he had done and must atone for.<br>
Of course, Lord Antonanth denied everything, and countered that Lord Lanadan's own son had started the whole mess by abducting his daughter. The proof was presented in a long run of druids porting from one city to the other with various witnesses, scrolls, other proofs...though of all of these, Roderick was not presented, nor was Lady Alamathea. Lanadan knew if he let either out of his sight now, or the Teir`Dal boy, that he might not see them again for quite some time.<br>
In the end, it had come to Lord Narson having no choice but to call a Great Council of the remaining ones left...Kaladim, Qeynos, and the Outpost would send their own to Freeport, as well as the three from Highhold who had sat upon the Felwithe Council and were still alive. Lord Lanadan knew doing so was politics, that Lord Narson could surely have come to Qeynos to do such a thing, and he stated so in a scroll. Why move everyone and the evidence when it was in Qeynos? Which would also weaken Lord Antonanth's position as he had no power in Qeynos other than he was a Knight, and his first wife had been from there.<br>
So Kaladim stated they were coming to Qeynos, as Belerak was already there to begin with, and only his most trusted would come to join. The Outpost was sending its representatives, and those in Highhold were coming down to join in the acusations. Freeport had its hands tied, and Lord Narson had no choice but to bow to the greater force and tell Lord Antonanth he would accompany them, under suspicion, to Qeynos for questioning before the Great Council.<br>
Roderick's estimation of two days before their arrival, for the Freeport contingent was meeting with the Highhold one and both moving at once from there, was an accurate one. Lord Lanadan had ordered the Guild Hall cleaned beyond all times past, and Qeynos' Lord realized what was happening within one of his temples and did exactly the opposite...he left the ruins as they were to demonstrate what had happened, and to show Lord Antonanth that his city would not fall to a mere siege.<br>
Of Lady Alamathea, she secluded herself to her quarters, surrounded day and night by two Necromancers trained to smell the lightest of magicks not her own. Roderick was not the only one to fear for what was coming, and the repercussions coming to rest on the head of her sire, and her own. In some strange way, he knew that she realized this, but she continued to remain silent about it. She answered what questions were asked of her, ate when the healers told her to and studied, studied, studied as never before.<br>
On the eve of the arrival of the Freeport and Highhold groups, for they had been sighted on the road in Qeynos Hills and runners sent out to greet them, Roderick had gone to Lady Alamathea's rooms.<br>
She was staring out the window, out to the east, to the roads she knew were there but she could not see them.<br>
He came up behind her, his arms on her shoulders in an uncharacteristic gesture, and she touched them with her own.<br>
&quot;So...he is coming at last.&quot;<br>
&quot;We assume he's coming.&quot;<br>
&quot;To what end?'<br>
&quot;To THE end of the matter...and an end to all that might have happened and more.&quot;<br>
She looked up to him, older than she had been two weeks earlier. Her eyes were haunted and ringed with lack of sleep, despite nearly two days worth. Her fingers were stained with ink from writing down all she knew of what had happened from the day she had set out from Freeport in search of the glowing tower in the desert with four of Roderick's most trusted men.<br>
It all seemed a lifetime ago.<br>
&quot;He will take me away...and he won't allow me to return here.&quot;<br>
&quot;No one is taking you here against your will.&quot;<br>
Her head shook slightly. He did not understand. &quot;You are not female...under the restrictions of a sire and a lord.&quot;<br>
It was a slight nod he gave her, though the touching of his lips to her own briefly brought some color back to her pale skin. &quot;No, I'm far from female...and Lord Antonanth may attempt, I stress attempt, to take you from Qeynos now, and the city will, in all estimations, rise against him as never before.&quot;<br>
He took her hand, spinning her from the window and towards the door. It was good to finally see her unsettled again, but for reasons other than her sire's treachery. Pity he'd not listened to Tallik days earlier...perhaps she might have slept easier.<br>
He stood just at the treshhold of the door to her personal quarters, motioning her inside with his fingers. &quot;Now you...you go do whatever it is young ladies do when they must get themselves into formal gowns.&quot;<br>
To that, she laughed...the laugh he was used to, giggling and sincere and full of energy. &quot;We require ladies in waiting to attend us when we must be formally gowned.&quot;<br>
There was a moment's pause, and he was tempted, sorely tempted to call her bluff..and other matters...and her eyes were waiting for him to do so.<br>
But now was not the time for such things, and they both knew it, though the moment remained, and Roderick both cursed himself for the dictates of Duty and Honor and his own personal beliefs.<br>
&quot;I'll have someone sent up to assist you, then.&quot;<br>
&quot;And quickly,&quot; she laughed back, though she was still smiling when he pulled the door closed, and the two Necromancers went to either side of it.<br>
Pity he had not had the chance to tell her that she was probably going to be finished with the guild, no matter the outcome of the trial against her sire. He wondered what she would do then...what they would all do without her.<br>
