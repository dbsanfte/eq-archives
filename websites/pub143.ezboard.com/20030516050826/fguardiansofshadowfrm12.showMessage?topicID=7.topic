<br>
If he never lived a century, if there had ever been a trial or an argument he wished had never come to be, if there had been a way to stop the sun from rising just once at the expensive of his own life, he called upon the Lightbringer to, perhaps, one day, dull the visions of what came upon him late that morning.<br>
It was a jumble of rising bodies, fearful looks and hastily put together battalions. In the end, it was simply one massive group of men, women and all the assistance they could muster to head to Felwithe across the Butcherblock Mountain range.<br>
The smoke was seen ahead of them, despite the trees, for several leagues. Even with the aid of tracking wolves and the druid scouts who came reporting horror after horror, they could only reach the city by mid-morning....<br>
What was left of it, of course.<br>
Built of magick and of stone time innumerable ago, even the eldest of the elves long turned to dust now who could have spoken of its infancy.<br>
Felwithe's stonework, a mastery of marble and of magick, lay blackened....bloodied and, as one, the horrors of the undead were leeching it of what little life remained.<br>
From the scouts, it was learned that a messenger had come in the form of a young elven wizard, claiming to have returned from Freeport on a journey for the Guild Hall there and wanting to rest a night in his Homeland. The first deaths, it was pieced together later, began there, as did the portal for the invading force of Teir`Dal who started their way into the homes of those sleeping, and easily, through sheer numbers, overwhelmed any who might have stood against them.<br>
The few who had been out in the darkness...whether it be for a tryst with a lover, gazing at the trees, meditation, contemplation of something or someone, those few were the ones who brought back the horrors, and returned to see their homeland burning.<br>
Felwithe...there was little to do but clean up what was left of the horrors and bury the dead.<br>
But the noise was intense...the sounds of the dying, smoke and flames inhaled until one felt there was nothing else in the world but coughing, choking on one's own lungs. And the smells...rotting food too close to flames, burning wood, the stenches of battle...and bodies, so many bodies to be found.<br>
Roderick ignored it all, concentrating, as he knew he must, on the task at hand.<br>
Felwithe, when they arrived, was empty of all but a few Teir`Dal bodies who had, somehow, been slain. He ordered them into stasis...the few druids who could be convinced to do to ordered to take the bodies to Qeynos, not to Freeport, to perhaps understand what had happened and how they had gained entry without being noticed by the magickal marble stones that, in their own way, protected the city.<br>
To those who had come on foot with him, Roderick ordered them into groups of twenty, sending each into a district to search, perhaps, in the vain hope for survivors, perhaps wounded...or, at least, to get a body count. There were lengthy lists of those who dwelled in the city, and names...what would soon be whole Houses in some instances...they would be tallied off as they were discovered.<br>
Those from afar, having felt the weeping of the marble, had come as quickly as they could, arriving in small groups, singles, coming through the trees in a daze of crystalline tears of silence. It was they who began to organize and establish whom had been where, what family this was in this house, and so forth. Little had burned but mostly personal belongings and houses, but the blocks were still no longer white.<br>
This, to those elves who remained, and to Roderick...it was a sign that high magick was being used...and not a healthy sign at that.<br>
But...first, foremost, after the bodies and the wounded and comforting those men who had never seen a battle before was the horrible notion that the Teir`Dal were still here, somewhere. For as many dead as there were accounted for in the end, he estimated the force of nearly four hundred must have come through a portal to do such damage...<br>
Or one great magick user with an unrivaled power.<br>
Roderick split up the groups as well, older, experienced men with younger ones, who knew what battle was and how to deal with the horrors of what would be found inside the ruined homes.<br>
Roderick also had Daliea with him, as well as Shesa, whose husband had remained behind to keep Kaladim's own walls guarded in case of attack while the bulk of the force was gone to Felwithe.<br>
Other matters weighed on his mind, but he had little time to ponder them. Matters were piling up, strange things had happened, and above it all, the strange smell, the smoke, the other scents bringing him constantly to reality and wishing, again and again and again, perhaps, he had not sent Alamathea out of the room, in that, now, he might know where she was and not concerned for her safety.<br>
He knew battle, he knew death and dying were all part of the journey to meet the Lightbringer. If one lived the day, one gave thanks to Him...if one fell, others would help the soul journey into His realm. He knew the elves looked to Tunare, who was a gentle goddess of green and of peace, with a touch, on occasion, of the irritated. What She might think of this ultimate snub against Her Children was anyone's guess.<br>
Roderick determined that, sometimes, it was very good to be the follower of Mithaniel than Tunare...men knew how to handle such things...goddesses seemed just to want revenge.<br>
Then again, looking up for a moment, covered in blood and smoke, armor dented in some places from pushing aside burning timbers, plates of stone, metalworks...sometimes that could be for the better...nor would he blame Tunare if She sought retribution for this.<br>
It was the absence of the Teir`Dal that worried him the most, and the noise...a far off, almost rustling, a growing wind that reminded him of something he could not place, and yet, he knew he had to...but could not.<br>
Nothing was harming Felwithe now. Indeed, other than the blackened outside marble facade, it looked as if there was nothing amiss...until one stepped through the tunnel into the city itself, and was blinded, not by the whiteness of the marble and the elves themselves, but by the sights and sounds one could not possibly take in at once without closing one's eyes to it all.<br>
Roderick got reports in as best he could, noting that Shesa had taken Daliea with her to examine the most critical of the wounded and healing as best they could. They were fighting a loosing battle, for many had been left to die purposely, bringing tales of the horrors to the ears of the living, and then leaving them to imagine, in their minds, what had been.<br>
He felt a horror that no one had been able to find Daliea's mate, and there was still no word from Kaladim of Alamathea, of whom he believed he had been the last one to see her before she vanished again.<br>
He wanted to rub his eyes against the growing ache there, but his gloved hands were coated with ash and blood and other things...his hands would probably be the same.<br>
It was mid-afternoon, most of the men taking the bodies outside the city walls as they were identified, when Tallik caught his arm and motioned him, cautiously, as if they were conferring about the weather, outside to the city's ruined gates.<br>
Roderick stared at his old friend, at his companion, who was supervising the laying out of the dead. &quot;There is something amiss in the forest.&quot;<br>
&quot;Such as?&quot;<br>
Tallik shook his head, not knowing, but having something itching against his spine, something not quite right. &quot;Don't know, but the men are nervous. They say the animals are coming from that direction, and passing on in terror.&quot;<br>
&quot;Teir`Dal?&quot;<br>
Tallik shook his head. &quot;Would they let the animals live? No, they'd be slaughtering as they moved...and they can keep us holed in here for months. Daliea showed us where the hidden storehouses are.&quot;<br>
The noise was getting louder, as was the smoke, but Roderick was not certain. The sound...it was not the sound of battle-mail on shoulders and knees rubbing against one plate and another. It was something else, a low howling? No...a hissing...no, not that either.<br>
He could not see the sky unless he was in Felwithe, for the city's few tress had been burned, and beyond the high elves treasured marble walls lay the depths of Faydark itself, peaceful and somewhat wild, with the wood elves several leagues away in their city in the trees.<br>
Trees...a memory, gone before he could catch it, and he sighed, rubbing his forehead with the back of his glove. &quot;Keep the men moving. The more they have to do, the less they'll think about what they're doing.&quot;<br>
Tallik's quick nod sent Roderick back to the gates, pausing for a moment, then sighing. It would come to him eventually, but the noise was not an army coming.<br>
He paused, looking up in the black clouds and trying not to cough again. The great pools where the elves had once walked in peace and silence were defiled now, and Daliea had cried when she had seen them. Her first admission had been that they must be drained, purified, and, perhaps, in another generation, refilled...if it could be done in that short a span of time.<br>
Roderick was looking at the pools, to the reflection in their oily waters that had been blue and bottomless only the day before. The last of the floating wreckage would be cleared from it later in the afternoon, as the water was needed to put out the growing fires and it could not be done with all the floating things in it.<br>
His eyes suddenly widened, looking up slowly from the fouled waters to the black, roiling clouds moving over the city where, earlier, there had been blue skies.<br>
No...not rain clouds...<br>
He turned, remembering later that his voice had boomed along the marble walls, and nearly every man, woman and spirit had turned to look for him and respond to the voice.<br>
Many dozens, later, attributed their lives to their curiosity, their Duty to find him and see what was wrong. And being he was near the pools, far away from the city's gates, saved more lives than he would know.<br>
Tallik was running into the gates, he saw, ahead of something flaring, a flush of red-orange-gold mated with yellow, dancing as the wind takes a sheet of silk and plays with it harmlessly.<br>
The sheets were not silk...they were fire...<br>
Faydark itself was on fire...burning itself from one end of the forest to the other.<br>
The sound had been the distant fires, the flames licking at the crowns of the mighty trees, and Roderick could only stare at the few men who made it into the tunnel before the air within it turned the tunnel to the gates into a vortex of air and flames.<br>
Beyond it, he did not want to comprehend what was happening to the forest...and those within it. He could only find himself on his knees, asking the Lightbringer to take few souls, and to spare those who were needed for the coming cause.<br>
And a cause it was becoming...a cause that he would, later, find had taken more than Faydark's greatest cities.<br>
<br>
---------------------<br>
<br>
A day after the firestorm, Roderick, Tallik and Shesa ventured through the now fire-scorched tunnel of Felwithe to stare out at the ruins of the forest.<br>
Faydark's greatest pride...its trees...for the first time in probably more generations than Felwithe had been a home to the elves...light was falling on the ground.<br>
There were no trees to block the sunlight.<br>
There were no trees left to even attempt it.<br>
The fire had been set near the castle, Roderick later learned, fanned by winds of magick, and magickal flames that created their own winds. The roar he had been hearing from afar had been, in part, the trees releasing their leaves to the flames...<br>
And Kelethin burning, with nearly a total loss of life. Those few druids, trackers and a score of others who were scattered on various journeys, missions and other matters...if they knew of what had happened, they were probably useless beings, wrecked with mental horror. For those who would not know by anything other than rumor, he pitied those folk more.<br>
Felwithe stood, but without its people. Kelethin had been razed, along the the forest, for refusing to yield to Lord Mayong's demands of turning the city over to his minions. Roderick only hoped that Kaladim still stood...there was no word from the gnome city, as a mountain range partially sheltered them from the greater bulk of Faydark's mighty greeneries.<br>
Roderick himself had looked out onto the ruined stumps of trees, to the ruins of league upon league of blackness and ash, and had felt the weariness of years upon him. Middle age was a time for most in the Guild Halls to begin preparations for what they wished to do when they were officially taken off the Field list and put into the Hall listings to teach, lecture and, perhaps, assume greater duties.<br>
Roderick was not middle age...coming fast as the years did to all, but he felt greater than even the elderlies as he stared out. There was no way to return to Kaladim until the heat leached from the soil...baked in some places it looked, logs still steaming from the firestorm.<br>
Daliea had been put into a healing sleep by Shesa after she had come around the corner of a house to stare at the flames coming out of the tunnel. There was nothing left to burn near the tunnel, or the city itself would have gone up in flames also. She had made a choking noise and collapsed, and Shesa had only moved her closer to the pools to heal herself with sleep.<br>
Roderick felt old...he could see it in Tallik's face, in Shesa's rounded shoulders, defeated in ways none could speak of, and yet, they all knew they must talk of it or they would truly all go mad.<br>
Roderick's men, however, were exhausted. They needed sleep, and he bade them get it while they could. They drew numbers to see who would take watches, promising as best he could, another attack withstanding, that they would all sleep as long as he could allow them to.<br>
They were afraid to light torches due to the remains of Faydark's forest, as well as the still, in places, smouldering remains of Felwithe. Cook fires were carefully made on the marble tiles in the center of the city, where nothing flammable could be nearby even with the strongest winds. And Roderick had left explicit orders that the first one to set a fire in the city would be hanged as an example to the others.<br>
He felt old...he was tired to his bones, and he looked down to the hand on his arm, bare, fine, well-formed fingers making clean indentations on the blood and ash coating his armor. There should have been a glove there, but he had, sadly, given it to the elf wizard many days earlier.<br>
&quot;Where have you been?&quot;<br>
Sad eyes looked at him, to the devastation beyond, and her head shook. &quot;I didn't want to hear any more about Sire...and you wouldn't tell me any more...so I came here last night....&quot;<br>
&quot;The people were being slaughtered last night, you could not have been here.&quot;<br>
Shesa and Tallik, for some reason gone, though only the Lightbringer knew why. He was left with her as she turned him from the ruined trees, leading him up into the minarets of the castle's outer walls.<br>
She stopped abruptly, making a strange gesture, and the wall opening, and leading him inside, closed it behind her with the same magick. &quot;Daliea showed me this many, many years ago, when I was a child. She was trying to show me places where I could go to hide from my nanny, who she thought was too strict with me.&quot;<br>
The room was sparse...pallets laid out for five people, supplies in a corner in wrapped burlap bags, whispering with magick to ward away decay and insects. There were blankets, clothing, all necessary items for one needing to escape or to simply hide.<br>
The windows, one that looked out to the Faydark, the other that looked into Felwithe, offered him a better view of the devastation...a view he found she was standing beside him to look at.<br>
&quot;I Healed who I could...but I couldn't do it alone. They came in a tide of blackness...it was a spell of some sort that...&quot;<br>
Her fear at his hand on her throat, being pressed against the wall of marble and staring up into his hard eyes. Even his voice was low, menacing.<br>
&quot;There is no way you could have escaped last night. Even the children were injured, or worse. Why would they have left you alone?&quot;<br>
She was shivering, eyes nearly crying with fear, head shaking very slowly. &quot;You don't think I did this?&quot;<br>
&quot;Your Sire is about to stand Treason for sending my battalion into an unknown area, without backup and without warning that he was neither coming nor coming to assist at all. That makes you either an accomplice or a victim. Which shall we write you as, and then investigate that?&quot;<br>
Her horror reflected in her eyes, and it hurt him, twisted his innards to force it on her. But she was of a Noble House, one of the oldest ones in Freeport, a long line of Knights and Healers who dedicated themselves, their lives, and their souls to others. She had been in the Guild Halls long enough that she understood she had come from a sheltered existence, though she was not as pampered as some, having been raised nearly all her life in the Guild Halls.<br>
And now, he was accusing her of the same Treason they were going to bring down on her sire's Name. And she had nothing to say, nothing but to stare at him, open-mouthed and head shaking slowly. Her face was ashen, her tan finally beginning to fade and he thought she looked no more beautiful in her bloody armor, right glove missing and the left tucked into the corner of her waist.<br>
&quot;You cannot believe...I did not do this...&quot;<br>
He released her, walking to one of the pallets and stripping of his armor. Exhaustion, he knew it was taking its toll, and there would be no way Tallik or Shesa would know where he was if an emergency arose.<br>
Fingers were helping him with the straps to his breastplate, removing it clumsily and then standing back as he took off the rest, setting it in a pile of clanks and clouds of ash as he collapsed in his tunic and leggins on the nearest pallet and sighed.<br>
She was staring down at him, face a mask of betrayal to the one person whose Honor and kind words she had most often sought out in the Guild Halls. He thought of the journal...the General's Woman. What would they think to find him here, in a spire above the city, hidden behind marble and stone, alone in a room with the most beautiful view...or what had been...and with a lovely young woman who he knew was innocent, but was forcing her to reveal her actions.<br>
&quot;If you're going to pout, do so quietly. I want to sleep.&quot; He shut his eyes tightly, giving a sigh and trying to put the visions of the whole day away from him.<br>
The fingers against his shoulders were gentle, finding every knot in his muscles as he nearly leapt out of his tunic in fright. &quot;WHAT are you doing?&quot;<br>
Lady Alamathea simply stared at him as if burned herself, and he finally looked at her, seeing her at last.<br>
Her hair, burned to just below her ears and singed on the left side, one eyebrow smudged to a rusty-tone from a bloodstain that ran up into her hair where she had probably attempted to push it from her eyes before it had burned away. Her fingers were stained in blood also, circles beneath her own eyes and her face ashen, not simply by his words but from the day's horrors.<br>
She had been here, that much he could see from her armor, from her body language and her eyes. Her eyes were aged now, as his had been that first battle when he had been given a choice: fight and defend or die and let others take up the sword.<br>
He helped her out of her armor, the tunic still to large for her and held her, back against the marble that, perhaps, was one of the last remaining white spots in the city. In the corner of the room, her head tucked beneath his chin, he held her, letting her cry as he had once done in the silence of his own room.<br>
When sleep finally took her from emotional exhaustion, he too, slept, listening to the claws of the birds on the roof above them as they scrabbled for a place to perch and he fell into a slumber.<br>
Eyes closed against the menace of flying things, watching him, watching the city, and flying back to the castle to report all.<br>
