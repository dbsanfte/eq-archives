Well, a rather successful two years for himself, as he could only speak for himself and his family, and he could not find any true complaints to be had on Solstice that needed to be aired to anyone around him.<br>
Tiabrin’s ultimate sacrifice for Alamathea’s life had stunned both the Guild as well as those who learned the news, and the Healers in Erudin had confirmed what her own Blood Brother had not been privy to...the woman had been dying, in her prime, and would not have lived to birth the child, let alone have survived the bearing process to raise the child or produced a healthy child at all. Whatever had been consuming her, she had shared with Lady Alamathea, who, in her search for a possible way to defeat Lord Mistmoore, had also been searching for a cure.<br>
A cure, sadly, that had been not found, and the option for her to find one and test it had been taken from her. She had been too weak on the table to fight Tiabrin’s choice, and by the time she had been conscious enough to do so, it had been beyond the time to go back.<br>
Tiabrin had quickly been honored with nearly a dozen people in any given city naming their daughters for her, as well as a book or two given to her short lifetime and her actions, few outside of Erudin though they had been. Scribes were ink-deep in messages from city to city, and Erudin found itself besieged by people wanting to know more about her, and of her quiet strength and where it had come from. Chathal found himself not so much sunk in grief for not seeing his own Blood Sister’s illness, but for the great interest in Healers and his city that it brought, and he was carried along with endless questions and details that, as Roderick had been done to, kept him going through the time of mourning.<br>
Tallik had been taken by grief for having been part of her death, but Illiysha had been standing right behind him, giving him no time to wallow in pity when she got two of her own sons to get him drunk and take one of her daughters to bed with him one night. A rather nasty trick on Illiysha’s part, but the daughter in question had often been singled out by the man when he came to Qeynos with Roderick.<br>
Of course, Mylissyl had not been Illiysha’s first choice for a wife for him, but she would do...she would do.<br>
Tallik himself, sought with the horror of what he had done the morning after, had had no choice but to bring the young woman to Illiysha and confess she was no longer chaste, and that as a Knight he had no choice but to offer for her hand.<br>
With all the mock horror and feigned embarrassment she could gather to her being, Illiysha sadly accepted this, but Lord Lanadan did not. Only if Tallik assumed the Guild Knight position of Freeport would he be absolved of all wrongs. Roderick had only chuckled behind the back of his friend, sensing a setup as never before, and knowing that his sister had long chased after Tallik when he went to Qeynos. Mylissyl was rather smug that she had gotten what she wanted, and she noted that afternoon that they were wed that he was going to be rather easy to manage, and Illiysha had only grinned back with a knowing look.<br>
Manage what, however, Roderick had turned away from, grinning. Tallik had a rather long haul ahead of him, despite literally losing a potential wife and unborn child one day and two days later finding himself before the Lord of Qeynos to be married to another and the future Guild Knight of Freeport. It seemed he was suddenly being thrown out from the ash pit and back into the fire, such seemed the road ahead of him. And no easy one if ever there had been a tangle of knots and deception to be worked out at Freeport’s Guild.<br>
The Lord of Freeport had demanded that if the Guild were to continue within the walls of his city, then Lord Narson must be removed. Vreaa, Belerak, Chathal, Lanadan and Roderick had come, demanding the man step down and only after he had been holed in his private quarters for a day, realizing that none were going to assist him, not even those he had bribed, he finally opened the doors and gave in to the charges laid against him by both the Guild and the Lord of Freeport. It would be many, many years before he was entrusted with anything outside raising simple crops on the penal colony on one of the islands in the Ocean of Tears.<br>
Tallik had become Guild Knight of Freeport within a week of the spell, not without balking of course, but only to look at Lanadan and then to the young woman at his side and nod and sigh with defeat. He had been set up, he obviously saw that in hindsight at some point, and there was nothing more to be done about it than accept it and work with what was at hand.<br>
Roderick was more startled that Mylissyl had become such an organizer, for there had been no Guild Lady in Freeport in quite some time, and it was in complete disarray, or so she often wailed to Illiysha in long scrolls. Illiysha left her home to meet Gynath and Vreaa’s mate in Freeport to see what needed to be done. And only after three months of burning many candles for inventory, seeking new homes for some items, or simply disposing of them in the market was it up to Illiysha’s strong sense of “clean”...or at least, on the road to it.<br>
Mylissyl took hold of Freeport’s duties with a good, firm hand, and Tallik had no choice but to follow the example, no less famous figures than Lanadan and Vreaa aiding him, as well as Lord Dryl, who had assumed the Guild Knight in Felwithe upon being voted unanimously. He had been at the Outpost during the destruction of his homeland, and was being assisted as best he could with the reconstruction.<br>
Of Felwithe, however, there was little to be done. The city’s wooden remains had been burned, for there was little to reconstruct until new was brought in. Erudin and the Outpost sent most of the wood, and Kaladim lent its masons to repair what they could to the marble and stonework. Felwithe would never be the grand city that it had been, but in generations, it would once again be a sight to behold again. Families were moving back slowly, bringing what they had had with them, what might have been salvaged before the second burning of the city, where the Souls of the Dead were Honored. It would be a long time before the elves stopped weeping it was said.<br>
The trees had been furiously replanted with the help of the druids and the few remaining fairies who had survived the burning of Faydwer. Sprouts were sent in from all cities, fast growing and slow growing planted in stands to help the soil recover itself, as well as smaller plants to help the soil remain where it was. Lord Dryl was open to any assistance that could be had, and Tallik often sent young squires and Knights there to prove that they were trustworthy and could prove themselves again. He also sent strict words to Lord Dryl that anyone who was even the slightest bit inclined to anything that was not the duty of a Knight, they were to be returned to Freeport and investigated immediately.<br>
Freeport itself was also, slowly, coming back to what it had been...or, more precisely, what it had once been before Antonanth’s grab for power. Tallik and Mylissyl knew there would be many years ahead of them struggling, but what they accomplished in the first few months of taking over in Freeport was well received by all.<br>
And receiving was something Freeport, and Qeynos, knew how to do well.<br>
The Lord of Qeynos had learned of Lady Alamathea’s abduction on Solstice Eve, and had been determined, through various sources, that it would have been a welcome night. In celebration of the lack of there having been a joyous Solstice in his own city, the Lord had called upon a Solstice Celebration, and had the city decked out in finery as if it were that time of season once again.<br>
For Illiysha, it was the most smug day she could remember in many, many years, and even the kitchen staff in the Guild had noted that, for once, she was not overseeing their duties..she was baking them herself from her own mother’s books.<br>
Beneath the moon as full as it would have been on Solstice Eve, gathered by the waterfront that was slowly being rebuilt from the attacks, Roderick Peacekeeper of Qeynos, General and Knight of the Guild of Duty and Honor, brought out the ring of pre-nuptuals that he had chosen in Erudin for Lady Alamathea Hopeseeker of Freeport, True Healer of the Lands, and with her permission as he knelt before her, slid it on her finger with a roaring cheer of both family and friends as Witness.<br>
The Guild that had Charged Roderick with Abduction had, somehow, come to realize that the Charges had been brought to hide Antonanth’s wrongdoing, and they had been dropped with a formal agreement of the Guild Council. The happenings in Freeport were left behind, not forgotten, for such records were always kept, good or bad, and the lesson of example made to the young squires that greed must always be forsaken for the good of others. Those of Qeynos had only to stare at the young woman in the white, hooded cloak to know it for a truth.<br>
If Tiabrin’s sacrifice had been one of ultimate proof that there was still good in the world, the Guild Hall of Qeynos had re-found its soul in Roderick’s young wife.<br>
Lady Alamathea Hopeseeker, True Healer of the Lands, was simply now Alamathea Peacekeeper to those close to her, or Thea to a close few, though Roderick had taken to calling her something else when they were alone, was recovering slowly from the resurrection that had restored her to health and life. She had been told it might take upwards of a year to regain her full strength, not that Roderick was going to allow her anywhere outside of his sight for a rather long time. The wounds upon her neck had been healed, though they would leave permanent scars that would be with her for the remainder of her living days. She was often seen raising a hand to them, to perhaps absently check for scabs or blood, and always doing so when Roderick was away from her, as if in fear it might happen again.<br>
There were many mornings she was asleep at the table of the small room Illiysha had given her until the wedding, exhaustion leaching many of the things she had previously done from her bones, though she was often examined and found that she was regaining muscle tone as well as some weight. And hearing that she was horribly underfed from the spell was only one more reason Illiysha was in the kitchens on a near daily basis now, bringing up her finest tray to set before the young woman and the pair chattering away for hours as Illiysha’s young gaggle of gigglers did.<br>
Illiysha and Lanadan had been generous with gifts of their own to the couple, Roderick being the last of the sons to be married off, though certainly not the last child, though the only one who had even hinted he had wished the Guild Knightship. Tallik had grinned to his friend that there were a few promising young men in Freeport who might be taken with Illiysha’s gaggle of gigglers...a joke he rather regretted later that year when no less than all seven of the young women were sent to Freeport to assist their married sister. Assist in the sense of they were Tallik’s problem for several months, and Mylissyl only grinned when many of the Guild’s young men came courting at all hours of the day.<br>
Alamathea had asked for nothing for the wedding, despite it was tradition that the bride could ask one thing, within reason, of the future husband’s family. Lanadan had been kind to ask this of her, with Illiysha and Roderick alone as Witness, and had said that if she could not decide now, perhaps at another time, even after the wedding if it came to her. The offer stood that he would not refuse any request, within reason, that she made upon him, a sincerely generous offer, for all that she had lost and could not reclaim, ultimately, could have been Lanadan’s and Roderick’s upon the marriage if they had demanded it in retribution of the Charges against Roderick. The offer had been made, and with a quiet nod she had said nothing in return, and never would in the matter.<br>
Vreaa had come from the Outpost with several scrolls listing out what remained in his safeholding, only after consulting with Roderick first that Alamathea was strong enough to bear the news of what there was. She had scanned the list of what remained for items, instructing that everything be sold off save for the few items she claimed belonged to her mother, and that they be brought to Qeynos when there might be a ship coming that way. Vreaa had commented that the sale of so many items would bring a rather considerable dowry, as which, he courteously mentioned she had no official one to bring to the wedding ceremony.<br>
The money issue she had regarded with sad eyes from beneath the thick cowl of her brilliant white, hooded robes, for she felt secure in them, and Roderick knew she kept the hood up these days to hide what she looked like, pale and fragile and not wanting pity from anyone until she was well again. Her well-trained eyes had glanced at the scrolls, and then she had passed them to Roderick, stating that as her future husband, it would be his duty to attempt to find out whom in Freeport was owed what. If no records could be found, what belonged to her mother, now rightfully hers, would be her dowry, and the monies were to be given to Freeport’s Guild for damages of the past. Vreaa only nodded as she stood and left the room, noting with Roderick that the money would be held in a fund, and if it was ever needed, it would be available, and at her death, would be handed over to Freeport in her memory as a donation, and none the wiser.<br>
The wedding, three months after the resurrection, for that was how long it was taking to arrange the silly thing, or so Roderick was often heard cursing, turned from a close gathering of friends, when Alamathea had planned it, to basically the entire city being Witness to it and the Lady of Qeynos opening up the Great Hall in the center of Qeynos, normally saved only for Solstice and Birthing Day celebrations.<br>
Alamathea had received the two chests of items, which contained things her own mother had kept treasured, and found, sadly, that the two chests were not items of her mother and were items that had been saved, perhaps, for shipment elsewhere, possibly into the lower markets for easy money. The pain of having lost not only her Name in Freeport due to her sire’s actions, but also the things she remembered her mother having, saved from her own wedding, weighed heavily on her as Roderick’s brother’s wives spoke of their own dowries and their keepsakes.<br>
But Illiysha was not the Guild Lady of Qeynos for not hearing rumors, even if the rumors were direct pleas from Roderick himself. Illiysha spoke with Gynath, who was more than ecstatic to assist in the plot, as well as Vreaa’s own mate, who had nothing more pressing to do with herself and was looking for some mischief to involve herself in, and Dryl’s mate, of whom they must get to know as she was new to them and did she like tea? It was all a farce when Roderick joked with Tallik about it afterwards, having come to the dining area often nights to find Illiysha and the other women, and Alamathea secure within their clutches, at their own table, discussing patterns, weaves, skirts, sleeves, and Alamathea looking up to Roderick with a silent plea for escape.<br>
He had only grinned at her, and left her to her doom, taking his usual seat beside Lanadan, the two giving one another a knowing smirk.<br>
Roderick was rather drunk on many nights before the wedding, having attended the whirlwind affair of his sister and Tallik in one day’s time, who had not been given preparation, but there had been Illiysha’s hand involved there, and Mylissyl’s gown had somehow been ready and in her size for the day’s events. But Roderick had wanted to see Alamathea in something that she wanted, not something his mother dressed his sisters in like dolls.<br>
In spite of the many fine ones in Qeynos, Gynath had opened up Erudin to Illiysha’s ruling hand, the finest seamstresses coming to make the gown, and only on the day of the wedding did Roderick get to see what had been created just for the day...as well as enduring the quiet jests of what had been put beneath it for that night. Though Illiysha was loud enough to comment that it hardly mattered as that particular matter had already been seen to before Alamathea had walked out of the spell room on her own, and she was rather dark with her glare at her son when that matter was brought up.<br>
He did only as a good son could do in penance to that matter...he said “I do” to Alamathea, and by doing so, gave his mother another “daughter” to dress up in doll clothing, or so he joked to her.<br>
The wedding had brought about one another surprise, one to which, as the True Healer she had been there to officiate, when Lord Lanadan officially Named Roderick his successor for the Title of Guild Knight. He was no where close to stepping down, though there would be no discussion in the matter as he had Named Roderick early, and those of Qeynos could begin to get to know him now for later matters.<br>
Tallik had said it was about dammed time that someone else had been chained to a desk.<br>
Roderick and Alamathea had been left to their own for two days before taking themselves to Erudin to see to the erecting of a room in Tiabrin’s honor there, as well as time for Alamathea to see what had happened there after her abduction. Chathal and Gynath were welcome to the couple, and the city opening its arms to the young woman they had helped fight so desperately for, now dedicated to Healing and the only True Healer within the realms. It was only the quiet, strong words of Gynath, reminding many of the folk that this was their wedding celebration, and not a journey of Healing matters, that Alamathea had come to their city.<br>
It was, Roderick noted, something that he rather suspected was only the beginning of a quiet tide of folk to see his young wife. There had not been a True Healer in centuries, and the tales of her going against Lord Mistmoore...some were saying she had defeated him bare-handed, near death and spell after spell, and Roderick could only smile. He had been there, he knew what had happened, and she was his for eternity now. The triumph had been the Healers and the Necromancers bringing her back with Tiabrin’s sacrifice, but it had, ultimately, been his love for her that had given them the reason to bring her back, let alone she being a True Healer.<br>
Their return to Qeynos was a rather scheming one, Alamathea having stared many long hours out at the waters on the docks of Erudin, her feet dangling over the side and watching the ships come for more supplies. Roderick’s teasing question of taking one back had brought Gynath’s laughter that evening, and passage under assumed names was made for them<br>
For the future Guild Knight, the only True Healer alive, to be stealing back quietly on a ship instead of ‘porting in and giggling the whole way...Illiysha would have been scandalized...for probably about ten minutes, anyway, or so Roderick grinned at Chathal.<br>
When they had quietly appeared that next morning for the meal with the family, there were more startled faces and more laughter than had been when they snuck back into the city. The startled captain had been near giving the entire boat’s helm to Roderick when he discovered exactly whom they were waiting on from Erudin and nearly missing the outgoing tide.<br>
And so no egos were too bruised, there had been gifts for the gaggle of gigglers, as well as quiet words for Lanadan and a rather interested, surprised look from Illiysha, who had come to Alamathea in silence and taken her hands. When it was announced with a lengthy blush and a quiet voice over the morning meal that there were three of them who had snuck back on the boat, and not longer merely two, the Guild Halls had echoed with Illiysha’s squeal of delight and triumph. This, of course, bringing many up to the family quarters to find the news, and the Lord of Qeynos knew within an hour and sent his own words of congratulation...some claimed he had known of Alamathea’s condition faster than he had known his own city had been under siege.<br>
Despite the jokes Roderick received from his brothers and Tallik in a scroll, the Guild Hall once again became Alamathea’s home, despite her being a True Healer, and books were sent from the Healers Halls daily at her request for study. The Guild that had raised her, still, even despite some having barred her from her true calling as a child, and all that had happened in Freeport, it was still that...the Guild and her home, and she was not easily going to be wrested from them merely because she was something more now.<br>
Illiysha, after her initial delight at, finally, having a daughter pregnant within her grasp, was often commenting quietly that because of the spell and the heavy magicks worked, that Alamathea might not be easily birthing the child, and travel might be declined due to it. Roderick and Lanadan also took up the cause and the faces who came from great distances to, perhaps, be seen by the True Healer were judged first by the Healers Halls, and only if their illness was great, were they shown to Alamathea’s quiet little study with her endless books and ink pots, beside Illiysha’s own so that she could see who was coming and going of course, the door having long been taken off.<br>
Her reasoning had been terribly courteous, but also horribly blunt when asked why the door was gone. If there was a door, someone might accidentally close it, and where would she get her gossip from then? And certainly someone had to entertain the guests when Alamathea took her afternoon nap...no...doors were just not good things for one who had her fingers in nearly everyone’s lives so accurately.<br>
Alamathea had only been given a moment to nod, and then shuffled back to her study to do just that, Illiysha chuckling silently behind her back.<br>
True Solstice, however, found Roderick taking charge of many of the duties of the Guild in Qeynos, as Lanadan and Illiysha went to Freeport to help Tallik and Mylissyl with the celebrations, neither had ever prepared for such an affair without assistance. So Roderick and Alamathea took the duties of decorating the Guild Halls, though Roderick was careful not to let her far out of his sight, so close to her own birthing time as she was. Mylissyl had given Tallik a daughter earlier that fall, all jokes about another gaggle of gigglers arising over dinner conversation, though Tallik found himself utterly smitten with his daughter, despite his wife joking that she had gone to all that trouble and was now expected to cough up four more for his pleasure. There were already rumors that she had quickened again, though Mylissyl kept her own silent council until she was certain.<br>
Roderick had taken his duties of husband and lord to Alamathea one step further than he possibly should have, assigning a Knight to be within visual sight of her at all times he was not allowed to be at her side. Due to some of Lanadan’s needs, he was away from Qeynos often discussing matters with other Guild Knights, as well as in Freeport closing his own rooms there and assisting with the weeding out of the bad ones. Lanadan was also careful to keep a druid at Alamathea’s call at all times, should Roderick need to be summoned, and knew that Illiysha would keep her safe if something did go amiss. The duty of watching Alamathea became the duty of choice for Knights as she was often having them join her for meals, discuss matters of healing and Guild politics as well as, sometimes, invited to occasions she might be hosting. When a Knight was assigned the duty for a week, as was the policy Roderick had requested, they were often in awe of both the woman and her husband.<br>
Solstice Eve brought the Guild Knights to Qeynos, for Alamathea could not travel due to the child nor would Roderick allow it, but the gathering of so many Guild Knights also brought a visit from the Lord of Qeynos, adding his own promise that if they required anything in the future, in any city, to merely ask. The past would not be repeated, not in his lifetime, nor that of his children, of that, there were many assurances of.<br>
Chathal and Gynath, Vreaa and his mate, Dryl and his mate, Tallik and Mylissyl and the others came as they could for Solstice in Qeynos. Shesa and Belerak came late, as they always seemed to be doing, barely ‘porting in before dusk, making their way to the Guild Hall, only to find the commotion of Roderick nearly beside himself with fear and Alamathea feeling the first pains of coming birth.<br>
It had been a gentle kiss that reassured him, a look of knowing and a hand she had pulled against her lips, silencing him. “Now go wait as all men do,” she had shooed him off with a knowing look to Lanadan, ushered off by Illiysha and the women with a grin.<br>
Solstice, near sunrise, saw the birth of Roderick’s first sons....Tial and Brind. How she had hidden it from him, he would never know, but Illiysha had been grinning from ear to ear with the news and the two bundled babies, strutting through the city with them and announcing their birth to anyone who would give her a moment’s glance. It was often joked that Roderick only got to see his sons when Illiysha was finally stripped of the children by the Lady of Qeynos and they were returned to Alamathea to rest...several hours later that was and many, many streets from the Guild Hall.<br>
Roderick had not known whether to beat Alamathea for keeping such a thing from him, or to merely attempt it again, and the gentle look of her eyes was more laughter than it was indignation when Illiysha joked about turning her into a broodmare.<br>
Alamathea’s plate was often full, both of food and duties, the twins eating much of her time as babies often did, both settled by her desk in the study in small baskets to sleep and always within a finger’s touch if they fussed. Even with people coming and going for Healings they were with her, though they were, at times, moved to Illiysha’s study if the Healings would require a possibly infectious disease, or Alamathea did the Healings in the Healer Halls if there was too great a risk.<br>
The Lady of Qeynos, also finding Alamathea a charming guest, had her up in her chambers often, speaking of matters and such, for they were near the same age, she having been the Lord’s new wife just before the siege had occurred. She and Alamathea were often seen walking their children along the docks in the afternoons speaking of whatever came to mind.<br>
Illiysha often commented that between the pair of them, she truly did not know how they found time to spend with one another, and Roderick only grinned when Alamathea gave him twin sons, again, near the summer of the second year after the siege, Illiysha baffled that this time she had not seen it coming, and Roderick giving his mother a rare kiss on the cheek with an “i win” look on his face. Alamathea had merely given a lady-like blush and gone about her studies, making certain that Brind would keep out of the inkpots this time, and that Tial might perhaps learn to eat with a spoon of his own soon.<br>
Qeynos was prospering, Erudin’s Library had been repaired and Felwithe was finally beginning to see some life restored within, and without, of its marble walls. Some spots, the blackened fire marks would never truly fade, and Lord Dryl had ordered them left there, as a reminder to all, of what the greed of one man could do to many.<br>
Felwithe had only to see its own arrogance in the Mages Hall, if one dared enter it, and to look upon the frozen face of the Lord of Mistmoore, to see true greed. Bound by the Mages for an unknown time, bringing him there had been, at first, a horror to all, and had been rejected by many. But Lord Dryl had insisted, stating that, perhaps, if his own people had been a bit more open with their ways, a bit less arrogant to the younger races, perhaps more open-minded at the hints and pieces, even years later, that were coming to light of the treachery...perhaps if they had been less elven, their lands might not have been scourged. Lord Mayong Mistmoore remained in Felwithe, checked several times daily and nightly for his bindings, his crimson eyes watching all with a burning hate and no control of his body, waiting for another chance to arise once again and reclaim his lands.<br>
Lord Dryl knew the day would come when the bindings would weaken, but he also pledged that, perhaps, on that day, another True Healer would be alive to learn from the past, and end it for an eternity.<br>
Alamathea had been asked to do the duty of destroying Lord Mistmoore, either by spell or some other means of magick or otherwise when she was stronger, and it had been a great honor, the Guild Knights coming to Council in Felwithe to discuss it, and she with them as the True Healer and an advisor to them now.<br>
Roderick had said nothing, wanting his own revenge on the man for what he had done to his wife, and on Antonanth, who had broken his bindings somehow and taken his own life as they had been casting the spell in Qeynos on his one-time daughter. The choice was that of his wife, and he would stand beside her, in whatever she chose to do.<br>
In calm, nearly whispered words at first, Alamathea had refused the offer, stating that what lived, held by magick, would be more a reminder than words on a page to the young ones. Were Lord Mistmoore kept alive, it would be the greater show that such things must be avoided, and that there must be Duty and Honor in all, or such chaos would, again, prevail. The next time, she also warned, as the pages kept the log of the meeting, the next time there might not be a True Healer...and the Mages might not be able to bind him as they had this time. They must be prepared, and they must always be ready for the day when he escaped.<br>
She had been given the opportunity to see him, in the Mages Hall, and had quietly refused, head looking away from the Council from beneath her hooded robes and Roderick’s hand gripping her own tightly. Of the horrors she had seen, twice, in the castle, she would not speak of it to him, or to anyone. He had seen some of them, returning to the castle to help clean up what remained of the undead. It haunted him now, and he knew, sometimes, when he held her after a nightmare, that it haunted her more for not having the hardening of battle behind it that he did.<br>
Lord Mistmoore’s reign over his castle, again, had come to an ending of both death and renewal, but it was an ending.<br>
For now.<br>
The second Solstice after the Siege of Qeynos found them enjoying a time of peace, for the moment. Peace being a relative word, in all sense of it, as Illiysha was never happier about finally having a woman stay in one spot where she could coddle grandchildren all day long. And Lanadan was often finding ways to roam the halls towards Alamathea’s study, himself finding great delight in bouncing a grandson on his knee or the pure delight of assisting with one’s first steps from one edge of the study to the other.<br>
Scandalous...simply scandalous Roderick thought of it all...to think something so small could drive them all to distraction with a single shriek and twenty minutes later be in the most sound sleep that even an explosion could not wake them from. And always, always giving him that lovely smile as he entered the room, tiny fingers and stained fingers always wanting up into his arms, though there was another smile he was always searching for first.<br>
Already growing round with another child, despite Illiysha’s warnings about spacing them too closely, though Gynath had chided Illiysha that the young woman...young mother now she corrected herself...was a True Healer and would know her limitations. Roderick already knew it would be another set of twins, for it seemed to be the only thing she could produce, much to both his grinning enjoyment and the giggling of his sisters and the Guild. Though he had strictly informed her that after six sons, they would be waiting a while on another set due to he would have no where to place them all if she continued throwing them in pairs.<br>
Alamathea had only grinned back at him, stating that if the Guild ranks were low, what better way to fill them than with the future. Roderick had just laughed at first and relieved her of her duties of study, giving her many reasons to remember why he had rescued her, and why the Guild Halls were swelling with young men and women.<br>
Tallik would be at the Solstice festivities in several hours, coming with his own growing brood of a daughter and a newborn son, as well as several adopted children. He would also be bearing the company of a young Knight who was soon to pledge his Name to another of Illiysha’s gaggle of gigglers, though she would find out about that later than the rest of them.<br>
To have kept a secret from his mother for nearly a week...thanks to Alamathea, it had been done, and he was more amazed than Lanadan that Alamathea had kept the silence up for so long on the matter.<br>
Baffling...simply baffling that someone could out-wit his mother at the game after so short a time.<br>
He wanted nothing more than to revel in it forever. Though he had met with young Knight previously, nothing official of course, when it had been mentioned of his interest in one of the gigglers, and Roderick had given his own nod to the union. He was a kind man with a long line of Knights in his family, as well as he also adored his sister despite her faults of being his sister to begin with.<br>
Sitting quietly before the festivities in their room, looking out over the city at the setting sun over the waters, Roderick and Alamathea held their glasses high to one another after exchanging simple gifts, more formal ones to follow as was the custom and lightly drinking before it all. They toasted one another, as all did, to health, to happiness, and to peace.<br>
Peace, as they understood it now, as their names were shared, having taken a new meaning as Brind came in proudly, having found another of his mother’s endless supply of ink pots and displayed the now-empty pot happily above his head... his works of finger art all over himself, his clothing, and the bed he had supposedly been napping in.<br>
Roderick had found happiness, not as he had imagined it on the sands of the desert, and had only chuckled as Alamathea’s groan echoed through the rooms, a fair hand to her eyes to rub them and, again, curse that she was to give him another set of boys to torment her. That they were only taking after him as a curse to her for something she herself had tormented her own mother over.<br>
He answered her as only a husband and father could, laughing later as they escorted their young sons to the celebrations near the docks, all four sleeping soundly long before the stroke of midnight marking Solstice as truly there.<br>
With family, with Tallik and Mylissyl and Illiysha and Lanadan and the gaggle of gigglers, one rather stealthily hanging back near a certain young Knight and asking his opinion on the wine rather often to hide a sneaked kiss while the others giggled knowingly, Roderick and Alamathea Peacekeeper raised their glasses in toast with the Lord and Lady of Qeynos, as did the others at the stroke of midnight, with the moon rising behind them, and the world, once again, as best it could be, upheld with Duty and Honor, Norrath basking beneath the hands of the Gods above. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub143.ezboard.com/fguardiansofshadowfrm12.showPrevMessage?topicID=19.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub143.ezboard.com/fguardiansofshadowfrm12.showNextMessage?topicID=19.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub143.ezboard.com/fguardiansofshadowfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19.topic&index=2><img src=http://georgiascreations.homestead.com/files/forestreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub143.ezboard.com/fguardiansofshadowfrm12.emailToFriend?topicID=19.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub143.ezboard.com/fguardiansofshadowfrm12.threadControl?topicID=19.topic><img src=http://georgiascreations.homestead.com/files/forestclose.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub143.ezboard.com/fguardiansofshadowfrm12.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=19.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub143.ezboard.com/fguardiansofshadowfrm12.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=19.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub143.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="guardiansofshadowfrm10">Guild Bylaws & Rules<option value="guardiansofshadowfrm1">General Discussion<option value="guardiansofshadowfrm4">Public Raids<option value="guardiansofshadowfrm9">Special Events, Etc.<option value="guardiansofshadowfrm3">General Chat<option value="guardiansofshadowfrm5">Guild only Raids<option value="guardiansofshadowfrm6">Guild Roster<option value="guardiansofshadowfrm7">Trade Skills<option value="guardiansofshadowfrm8">Guild Bank<option value="guardiansofshadowfrm2">Officers Chat<option value="guardiansofshadowfrm11">The Flame Room<option value="guardiansofshadowfrm12">Glories Of Old<option value="guardiansofshadowfrm13">epics<option value="guardiansofshadowfrm14">Quests</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#98FB98>- </font><a href=http://pub143.ezboard.com/bguardiansofshadow>Guardians of Shadow</a><font color=#98FB98> - </font><a href=http://pub143.ezboard.com/fguardiansofshadowfrm12>Glories Of Old</a> <font color=#98FB98> - </font><a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~guardiansofshadow/">Guardians of Shadow - Home</a><font color=#98FB98> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.240<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
