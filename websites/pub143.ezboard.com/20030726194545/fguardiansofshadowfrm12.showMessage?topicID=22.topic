<br>
They simply called her Mouse, because it fit her, and for no other reason than the younglings skittering about in the tunnels thought she was one.<br>
Dark of skin and half-hidden by nature, one could look up for a moment and see a head of white hair over the table, perhaps in front of a bookcase, rounding the corner from the kitchens or merely sitting quietly listening to the flute being played, as it always was, for special occasions or for wake up and sundown gatherings.<br>
Mice were known to simply look and be gone if there was danger, and she was no exception.<br>
So Mouse she was, affectionately, named by Arton.<br>
Elder Waylar was consistently with her those first few days in the tunnels beneath the city, a hand always at her hair or her shoulder as if she were one of his own children.<br>
In the way of their magick, she was.<br>
He brought her into the main meeting area when the flute, to her delight, beckoned them there, and with a gentle, papery voice but with steel behind it, he presented her to those around him, in robes and in steel, and said she was to be welcomed as one of his own Blood.<br>
The moment of nervousness had been broken, of all things, by one of the youngest human children she had ever seen toddling up to her on chubby, unsteady legs and reaching out for her own legs for balance, to the robe that covered them and nearly upsetting her into Waylar behind her.<br>
But the child's fascinated brown eyes looked up at her, wondrous and intent, even with her bending down to return his look of wonder, and he reached up a finger to her nose and poked it, drawing it back with a look of utter frustration.<br>
She was, sadly, not covered with either frosting from the cakes he enjoyed, nor with chocolate...sadly, again, to his dismay.<br>
Arton had put her in charge of his toddling son instantly, having lost his wife to the child's birth several months earlier and, as Recordkeeper, having little time for him, sadly. Firatha was captivated by his chubby hands demanding to inspect her hair.<br>
Elder Waylar and his sons, Arton and the man in steel who had taken the book down for Firatha, name of Drathyl, were both adamant that should she need something, anything, and if there was the slightest hesitation of it being given, to come to them. She knew little of the policies of the people in the tunnels, nor was she very familiar with anything other than the intrigue of her own city.<br>
She was embarrassed, suddenly, before the assembled faces welcoming her, that all she owned had been taken from her, and the simple gown she was in belonged to another.<br>
Supplies were overflowing, though, Waylar had comforted her when the pleasantries were exchanged. His two sons kindly said that all she had to do was ask them and, if it was within their storerooms, she was welcome to it. They had few newcomers lately due to the happenings in Felwithe and were keeping to themselves, hence little pockets were still hidden in and around the city, afraid to return home as yet for fear of exposing the whole. Arton spoke that their numbers were close to five thousand beneath this city alone, but so many came and went from city to city and then searching for knowledge, it was difficult to keep them all within wraps, until the Solstice celebrations that is. Then nearly everyone came back to their city of birthing to enjoy the day.<br>
Firatha was taken by Drathyl, Knight of Shadow and Darkness, with the same gentle touch to her shoulder that his own sire had done to her, and she was presented before his wife, Chiral, to be properly fitted for clothing. As Drathyl joked, his wife was Keeper of the Goods...that being she knew, within several inches, where everything was stored as well as having a very good guess who might had taken it if it was missing.<br>
Chiral reeked of magick, a magick Firatha could not understand at first, but the woman's robes revealed her pregnancy after she stood with Drathyl's help from her chair. Chiral's Necromantic magick was not the true magick of disease and darkness, but a lighter one of poisons and the study of how they worked. It was a beaming Drathyl who informed Firatha that this would be their first child, and that if Arton might not mind, would she be entertained watching the children to help Chiral?<br>
Fascinated, wholly entranced, she said she could, having watched her own siblings and her cousins many times, for there had been little else to do with her when Healings had been needed, and her Blood did not want her there to alter what they had done.<br>
Left with Chiral in the storerooms, Drathyl leaving a quick kiss against his wife's lips and then a pat to Firatha's head, the Teir`Dal found herself confronted with lists and questions and things she had never found herself lacking, but suddenly, as she had nothing, not even a comb for her hair or another gown, she was at Chiral's mercy.<br>
Chiral, a lovely woman with deep golden hair and a light laugh, only smiled and sat her down at a smaller table in a rather cluttered room outside the storerooms. Firatha later came to understand the clutter was simply not true clutter but the toys of the children Chiral watched in her spare time, and that, currently, they were napping in another room with the door closed for quiet. The children's table was still a bit small for Firatha, but much easier for her to examine the paper Chiral was scratching on.<br>
Undergarments, robes, combs, hair pieces, sheets, wallhangings...Firatha felt the horrors of suddenly confronted with what her sires had been doing for their children, or, at least, their servants had been for many, many centuries. She had no concept of worth, of goods and of where things came from. It had all been provided for her in the past, and now, seeing as she had nothing and needed everything, she was consciously aware that for all their kindness, these people were giving her out of generosity, for she had nothing.<br>
Within her boxed soul, she vowed to find a way to return what she had borrowed. Despite Chiral's kind words that the storerooms were coming and going with items always and that no one was ever in need.<br>
Two stronger, elder children were brought in by Arton later, with a kiss against his sister-in-law's cheek and inquiring of her health, and Arton's son was left in her care, once again, with a sigh of dismay and a shuffling of robes.<br>
&quot;He's got anger towards his son because he thinks the baby killed his wife,&quot; Chiral told her after the man had departed, taking the chubby child into her swollen lap and teasing his fingers with the end of the quill she was using to write down Firatha's needs.<br>
Never before confronted with such things, Firatha could only stare, and Chiral's quiet words took most of what remained of the time between the introductions before the mid-morning meal and the evening one. Chiral spoke of what they did beneath the city, of how goods were obtained and how people came to live there through their own wits or though the goodness of others...or worse cases, such as Firatha's, where it was a last moment's effort to save a life before it was extinguished.<br>
It was the beginning of a very long, long endless time of learning, re-learning, all that she had thought she had known about the world around her.<br>
Chiral had the elder boys send what Firatha needed to the room she had woken in, stating that the room had been empty for quite some time, and if she wished a smaller bed, one could be found for her. The books were for learning, for reading, and Chiral warned her that the books would let her know if she would be allowed to read them. Just as a library has sections, she explained to Firatha, so did they beneath the city, and no one person needed to, or could, know everything.<br>
Baffled with a head swirling full of new knowledge, Chiral let the two boys take Firatha back to her room to rest, Chiral herself requiring a nap and taking Arton's son with her to perhaps calm him down. Left alone in the room again, Firatha was confronted with the silence of re-counting all that she had learned in a very short time, and what she had discovered of herself.<br>
And there were some things, over the course of several weeks, it was discovered about her that made others grin to themselves.<br>
Suddenly confronted with human comforts, Firatha fell in love with the fluffy, stuffed pillows for her head, and there already having been four of them on the bed when she woke that first time, she had assumed that was the correct number to be had. Each night she slept on them, four of them just the right length to keep her in ultimate comfort. One of the night watch had been checking rooms, as was the custom when matters above in the city were uncertain, and Arton had been called to assure that Firatha understood that pillows were for her head, not for sleeping on.<br>
Chiral had giggled when Drathyl told her, and the pair giving Firatha a winning smile when she came for her lessons with the children, both trying with great dignity not to smile too hard with laughter.<br>
And she loved other things...stranger things. Arton's son had brought up the subject of sweets and desserts, something Firatha had no idea of what the words meant. Chiral had asked for a plate of delicacies one afternoon to be brought to the children, numbering nearly fourty and astonishing Firatha that one lone woman was in charge of so many. Chiral's two assistants, she was told, were in hiding currently due to they had been abroad when Felwithe had been attacked, and had sent word they could not, safely or with good heart, return to the city for fear of being seen.<br>
Firatha had offered, and Chiral had welcomed the assistance, all the while grinning when Firatha's eyes widened at the first tastes of chocolate, of pastries and sweets and Chiral had laughed at last at the facial expressions as all the children were staring at Firatha in silent wonder.<br>
Someone who had never had chocolate before...Chiral was nearly doubled over in laughter that night explaining it to Drathyl.<br>
More serious matters, however, had sent Firatha to Chiral despite what had seemed, at first, as a coincidence. Firatha was, despite her Teir`Dal age, quite young, a teenager of sorts, without nearly a century of training in what she was and, even greater, what she could do. Chiral's gentle lessons to the young ones, arranged by ages or by learning abilities, also enveloped Firatha as deeply as it did the young ones.<br>
Waylar himself was kept abreast of Firatha's developments, having gone to Qeynos himself for reasons known only to himself, but in later weeks came to play heavily with the powers that be. Letters were sent as they always were, until the day they stopped suddenly, and the first news that Qeynos was under siege brought Drathyl into the small room, looking with anguish to his wife and the children and Firatha.<br>
They were being sent to assist with what was happening in Qeynos...the Necromancers were helping the citizens of the city. Drathyl had never heard of anything like it in the past, but his sire had asked for the assistance, and he had nothing more pressing to do at the moment.<br>
Firatha watched the separation with eyes that were, slowly, being opened to the world around her. Chiral, nearing her time with each passing day, and Drathyl, not wanting to leave but unable to find a plausible excuse other than her condition, had nothing else to do but accept the separation for the time being.<br>
Drathyl had not been gone more than two ticks of the sand timers when Chiral asked if she could watch the children for a while as she needed to sleep. Perhaps they all might like an early nap, and Firatha nodded, unable to say anything in sadness, and watching the woman slowly walk out of the room, robes slowly stroking the stones as she went out.<br>
Nearly fourty young eyes looked at her now, waiting, and Firatha, to a horror, found she had nothing to do but stare back at them.<br>
Arton, usually bringing his son in the afternoons to be watched by Chiral's guiding hands, found all of them in two circles tossing balls to one another by magickal levitation, Firatha guiding them as best she could with one of the earliest teachings she could remember her own sires doing to she and her siblings. It was a test of magicks, and she was mentally noting who, if Chiral had not seen it, would require more work and whom might be a bit further ahead, or much stronger, than previously known.<br>
The entire room had silenced itself when seeing Arton and his son, and Firatha had explained that Chiral had gone to rest after Drathyl's departure, a departure that Arton himself had not been informed of. But the chubby baby in his arms wanted down and was set there, toddling with growing precision...whoops...no, landing in the lap of one of the older children, and then reaching out his familiar arms to Firatha's. She gladly took him on her hip, as she had seen Chiral doing, for Arton's son was the youngest of them all.<br>
Also, she noted, the one who received nothing in regards to praise or gratitude for the small steps he was taking to a greater life.<br>
A collective sigh rang through the two circles then, and Firatha deemed it time for sleeping, shooing the younger ones to their mats and the elder ones to quietly sit with her if they chose and perhaps play one of the many games set around the room.<br>
She never remembered when Arton's son fell asleep in her lap...only the sadness of having to give him to Chiral when she returned, for she needed to feed him his broth and vegetables. And, as his aunt, she felt it was her duty to at  least, in memory of the child's dead mother, raise him as best she could.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The Mouse loved sweets, she loved sleeping on pillows and burying herself under the sheets as if she were going to suffocate. She was often seen going from the many bookcases, neatly moving her hand from spine to spine, waiting for one to silently touch back and she would take it down, or wait until someone was near enough to do so for her.<br>
She was told, later, that nearly a year had passed since she had been captured by the guards and put in the cell. Not that time truly meant much down here, with the artificial lights and the many people coming and going, only Solstice the true test of time, or when people went above for goods and simply to get away for a while.<br>
Drathyl and Chiral had been blessed with a son of their own, much to Firatha's delight, as during the woman's convalescence, she was put in charge of the nursery, the two assistants having since come back to help with the younglings.<br>
Arton's son, now chattering and feeding himself, and always underfoot when Firatha was around, was also growing, though the distance between sire and son, she knew, was vaster than her own was if she were to have returned to her homeland and asked to be reunited with her Blood. She pitied the child and gave him extra hugs when she could, for they were new to her.<br>
She had never hugged anyone before, at least, not in the sense of what humans used them for. Hugs were to hold someone until another could either gut them or they could be taken for interrogation. The first time Arton's son had hugged her leg, she had had to bite back the instinctive fear that someone was trying to kill her. But the baby's arms had been too small to wield knife or poison, but they had not been small enough not to find the bowl of applesauce she had been going to feed him...the same bowl of applesauce that drenched him from hairline to grubby toes.<br>
Chiral often stated that Arton's son would not rest until Firatha gave him a kiss and told him it was time to sleep. The concerns she kept to herself, having her own newborn to attend to, and knowing Waylar would not have entrusted, or allowed, the children to contact with Firatha if he himself had not trusted her.<br>
The Recordkeeper himself, however, was also interested, as everyone else was, in hearing of Firatha's lands and what happened there from day to day.<br>
With his son in Chiral's keeping for a time, he had sat her down with a healthy meal between them, inquiring of what went on from sunup to sundown and all that happened in between that she could reveal to him. The daily routines she remembered all too well, and he was polite in asking what she could tell him of their Training, as well as how they chose their children for what magickal duties.<br>
To that, she had laughed, remembering her attempts at Healing and what had come of it, and shaking her head at him at her own private joke.<br>
Chiral's little hellions and their endless childish questions of why she was always covered with frosting were nothing compared to Arton's, and Drathyl's, questioning about her homeland. Their assurances of nothing she said, to the best of their knowledge, would be used against their lands was taken with a great deal of fear on her part, and only Elder Waylar, after several months of furious passing of scrolls from the siege of the city and the aftermath, had personally come to state the same.<br>
Firatha spoke of what she had done from waking to sleeping in quiet tones, Arton himself scribing and not including any younglings in the sessions, Drathyl sitting in on times when something of a militaristic sense might come into play. He was intenstly curious about how the Knights of Shadow of her lands conducted themselves in comparison to his own ranks.<br>
Little things caught Arton's interest...how they had known that their Blood were inclined to be people who healed and how could they know that every child that was produced in that Bloodline would be one also? As Firatha was obvious proof, if there was a failure in the Blood, it was not corrected. She did not speculate what would, eventually, have come about of her demise. How long she had been hidden from others, though, she was now wondering. And how long those of Darkness might have been watching her, waiting for their chance to invite her into their ranks, perhaps that also she did not want to know.<br>
Arton was a strong Necromancer, much stronger than Chiral, for he noted that men were stronger in magicks because theirs was simply for that...magick, and it was not divided at times for children. During times when he had meals sent into his domain in the Record Rooms, he often worked small magicks for Firatha, demonstrating through book and word and motion how things were done. That she had received training in the wrong area, but with no less furvor to succeed, only strengthened his attempts at showing her how to be more for herself. And her quiet, slow lessons with Chiral and the children were growing her magicks also.<br>
Arton's magicks, however, were showing her exactly what the Children of Darkness could truly do.<br>
One afternoon, he took her from Chiral and his son and into a previously unexplored area she had not been taken to. It was plain, the stone walls empty of everything, and for a moment, in her white tunic and belted leggins, she had feared becoming an unknown sacrifice to Arton's ways and had looked at Chiral in fear.<br>
But the walls echoed of magick, they reeked of it as Chiral had before her son had been born...old magick, new magick, magick that simply was waiting to be tapped. Arton had looked around the room with a deep pride and smile, then touching her hair as Waylar had done. &quot;This is where we work our magicks, Firatha, and where we go when we simply want to use them and see what we have learned.&quot;<br>
His eyes had been gentle as they looked down at her. &quot;Would you like to show me what you think you've learned so far?&quot;<br>
Would she?<br>
The temptation to smile, something never done before, had, she heard people snickering about later...Arton had spoken to Chiral that her entire face had gone a deep gray with embarrassment, and then turned its normal dark shades and her eyes had brightened with delight.<br>
Arton had brought out a small box from one area of the large, round room, setting a pile of bones in the middle of the room and stepping back, offering her with great dignity to show him what she knew.<br>
Drathyl found them near the midnight hour, still casting and both grinning, deep in study being watched over by summoned skeletons and debating some matter with delight. Mouse and Musty, Drathyl had grinned to his wife later that morning, as he often called his brother...it was good that his brother had finally met something to occupy his time.<br>
Firatha was told very little of Arton's dead wife, only that it had been a late marriage for the both of them, she wanting children and Arton not caring either way. She had been one of seven who had gone up into the city to trade for goods near the river quarter when someone had made an attempt on the life of the Lord of Freeport. Arton's mate had not been wounded in the fray, though the assistance she had given to the injured men in the aftermath had, eventually, been her undoing. Half-hidden by her neutral robes of a dull green, her magick had shown instantly when she had tried to capture, successfully, one of the two culprits and had held him with magick until others could arrive.<br>
Arton's wife had, ultimately, been poisoned in her food slowly, it was later determined, and the child had been the final blow to her health. Despite knowing the events, he could not find any other fault but that of his son for taking the life of his wife. Even Chiral had commented that it had not been a pleasant marriage, one more of duty in that Waylar had been inquiring of when he might form a union. Chiral was often quietly wondering, and Firatha listening now and then, if Waylar regretted pushing his son into a marriage that had ended in disaster.<br>
Arton's son, often watching the magickal inquisitiveness of the other children in Chiral's nursery, was also curious himself. Firatha often had him working on something with his hands, something always occupying his mind and his attention, though he demanded that she stay within touching distance. He never wanted, in his waking hours in the nursery, to be without her closeness. And Chiral was often joking, as Firatha helped her son with his first steps across the nursery, that Arton's son was more and more attached to her every day as a mother should be.<br>
Firatha had remained up that whole night, stretched out on her pillows on the huge bed, staring at the bookcases, mostly filled now with books that were her own to read and she had chosen. She could not sleep that night, after Chiral's hearty words, and the next morning, rising to the pleasant tones of the flute, had gone to Drathyl and asked if there might be something she could learn of warfare.<br>
If Chiral had understood Firatha's fears when she had been told the Teir`Dal was with her husband's men, learning to use a staff and a knife, she made no mention of them in public. But she had an idea of why Firatha had run, though it made the situation no less easy when Arton's son did nothing but cry the entire time in the nursery, setting off other children as well.<br>
It was not the best of days for anyone...Arton also, who was called after a few hours to come get his son and take him to his quarters.<br>
He had done what any respectful man would have done himself, saddled with such a responsibility. He marched his crying son up to the training area, staring at his brother's friends and his brother's commander and the lot of them staring at him in return. Firatha, breathing heavily and in a short tunic and half-leggins, had stared at Arton and the child in his hands, who demanded DOWN and ran across the sands to hug her legs.<br>
Drathyl had watched, having nothing to say himself, for he knew the signs, and had somehow coaxed the child off the sands for a few minutes while Firatha finished learning to spar with a knife against his commander. Arton had given no words, only leaving the child and departing in a flurry of robes and anger.<br>
The rest of the afternoon, Firatha had sat on the sands, amusing Kerlin with a toy sword and very, very quiet.<br>
Drathyl's midnight scroll to Waylar in Qeynos came as no surprise to Chiral, though it was with heavy heart that she added, as did two others, their concerns of what was happening with Arton's son.<br>
As a grown man, Waylar had no true control over him, but in the name of his grandson's welfare, they were all concerned that Firatha was becoming mother to the child, and being taken from duties they had to instruct her in before she could decide to remain with them or go on her own. It was their duty to her, at least, to show her how to work her magick as best they could in a very short time. The rest would lie in her hands.<br>
But, she could not do it with Arton's son hanging around her neck every day.<br>
So for the sake of records, new events that had shaped Qeynos, Waylar sent for his son and his grandson to come to that city to record what was happening, leaving Chiral to instruct Firatha quietly with the children, Drathyl to show her the ways to defend herself within the robes, it was stated, she would begin to wear before the year was out, such was her magick progressing rather at a breathless pace.<br>
So came Solstice, two years after her coming to the city by force, and when she was awaiting the arrival of Waylar and Arton with Kerlin. It was rumored they had great news, as well as assignments for some of the younglings to accomplish. Firatha was looking forward to seeing him again, having found her own ways out of the tunnels long, long ago in sleepless nights with some of the more adventurous older children. The little she had been returning to the storerooms from the city above, if Chiral had known whom was doing it, she had never spoken it in anger.<br>
It was a Solstice that would change them all forever.<br>
