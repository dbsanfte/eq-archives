Barak...the legend, the man, the one whom all her cousins had emulated themselves after...was it possible he was alive?<br>
The news from Gretta that the legendary Grand Master Knight, missing for many, many years before Firatha’s birth, now presumed dead honorably in some battle with his men, the Lost Mission of tales of glory and greatness and unknown bloodshed...the news that he was alive, was it possible? How had anything such as that happened, to even begin to dream that the great Grand Master Knight Barak was alive...and in Freeport...<br>
And the missing Grand Master Knight was alive, and he was married to a human?<br>
Firatha's mind was tumbling over and over again, as her heart was falling at the same rate. The dizziness she had originally felt when Arton had taken her from the tunnels to Gretta's clutches had only increased, and she had no idea of what direction anything was coming at her now.<br>
Barak was alive...and he had been avoiding her.<br>
Why?<br>
Arton had taken her back to the tunnels not long after finishing her ice cream, more cream than ice when Gretta was finished catching up on matters with her brother, and Kerlin was grumpy at being woken up early from his nap and fussed the way back, giving Firatha a welcome distraction at having to speak of everything she had been told.<br>
Been told? Been neglected from, perhaps? By whose choosing though? For her own good or at the request of others? And what more did she not know about matters in the tunnels, or was it even her concern to think of them now?<br>
Kerlin was left with Chiral once again, as was Firatha, both bewildered but back in familiar spaces and, it was hoped, to mull over what had happened before the evening meal. For Kerlin was always hungry, the little ball of energy eating twice what Firatha could possibly at one sitting, and no more than an hour later looking for more. The child's baby fat was quickly turning into lean muscle, and Chiral had often commented that Kerlin would be much like his father...tall and lean and with a head full of curling hair in all the wrong places over the eyes...but that there was no way to escape Kerlin’s eyes, the eyes of his dead mother, the ones that had always haunted Arton when he looked at his son.<br>
Firatha was no more startled when Waylar himself came to the nursery, as she and Chiral were gathering up the children to take them to the evening meal, and asked for her presence with him. A courteous request, but one she felt, in good curious consciousness, she dared not refuse. She had nothing pressing that evening to do, and Arton had not offered for their normal magickal sparring as he normally did when he left Kerlin in her care.<br>
Waylar took her to an area of the tunnels she had not previously been into...the realm of the Knights of Shadow, housed in a rather larger area of the tunnels due to the needs for armor and training and the smell of molten steel being worked and sweating bodies that would require more ventilation than the smaller areas could provide. She learned, later, that the Knights were directly below an arena in Freeport that was often used for wrestling, sparring, and the showing of fine racing animals when the Lord of the city was in a generous mood.<br>
To the assemblage gathered on the sands of the much larger ground than she had been to weeks earlier, Firatha was escorted onto the sands with Waylar’s gentle touch to her shoulder, her formal robes shusshing along the stones and her light sandals making no noise as was the custom of her people. She had not been given time to change from her time in the markets in the city above, and felt rather out of place in them, for she had not, as yet, been given the time, nor the right, to begin work on the personal sigils to mark the robes as her own.<br>
There, in a circle of loose faces, of steel and sword and helms upon their heads, Waylar paused before five arranged on the sands before he and Firatha, giving them a deep bow she had never seen him do before. It was a bow of respect she had never seen him give to anyone, but that all gave to him upon his entrance into a room or a conversation.<br>
As a one, however, the five bowed in return from the waist in respect, and as a one, they removed their helms, Firatha's own cry of fear turning to a look of awe when the five heads of white hair confronted her, the dark skinned faces smiling at her as gently as they could.<br>
In the center, Grand Master Knight Barak with his four missing men from the Lost Mission, his arrogant face not holding the arrogance she recalled from the many paintings that had been done of him in her former lands. His eyes were older, as was his skin a richer, deeper blue than it had been, for Teir`Dal skin darkened in middle age, and with the progression of the ages, eventually lightened to a sold gray with the coming of elderly status, and then in decline moved towards the white of death.<br>
Barak, Grand Master Knight of fame and times before her birth...he was staring down at her without malice, without the arrogance she would have expected from one so well known and so admired in the Teir`Dal lands...and he was certainly watching her with much personal amusement on his behalf, for he was smiling at her, a strange expression on the face of one whose job it was to kill others.<br>
Firatha sniffed lightly...something she found she had not done in many, many months now, not since her inclusion in the lives of those of Darkness in the tunnels. The smells of the tunnels ran into one another, but with her enhanced smell, she could smell the spices that Gretta loved to put in her sausages. The faint touch of the bread, and she knew he had only come recently from there, from his wife and his children and the shop on the waterfront.<br>
He was here. Something had brought him here, from the very place she herself had been brought to and then taken from after the meal...he had come here to see her.<br>
Face as scarred as the tales had told, having taken the edge of a blade against his ear and down along chin and throat to protect another's life, his hair was much longer now than it should have been, held back with a delicate gold wrap that sang of magick she had not felt before.<br>
Human magick wrapped with Teir`Dal magick...she should have guessed Gretta would have had some magick within her, but she had not even bothered to smell it.<br>
Waylar’s papery-strong voice inquired of Barak's health, and of his children, and the two were exchanging updates while Firatha stared at the men, looking from one face to the other and meeting their eyes in surprise, and finding them as equally meeting her own with not arrogance, but with amusement, perhaps just a touch of preening for a moment, a thrust out chest for a moment in pride of what they were. Her eyes finally ended, again, at Barak and found herself sinking again into a realm she could not return from.<br>
Five Teir`Dal had been here longer than she had...and she had not smelled nor known nor heard them.<br>
Waylar's hand on her shoulder held her up, and his gentle smile down at her as he squeezed her hand and drew her to one side was reassuring. &quot;Firatha, I believe that you may remember the tales of Grand Master Knight Barak, Knight of Shadow? He is our present Swordmaster here in Freeport if no one has introduced the two of you before now.&quot;<br>
Swordmaster...he was Drathyl’s commander...had he been in the march to Qeynos to assist with the siege there, she wondered, wondering what she she did not know because she had lived up to her being Mouse to keep herself safe from anything that might befall her?<br>
She nodded slowly to the question, her eyes unable to leave Barak’s grinning face, something else coming from behind the men, something in robes and moving slowly with age and with the weight of years.<br>
Waylar moved from Firatha's side, Barak also moving to escort the coming robed one, each man coming to a side and taking an arm as a chair was courteously brought up for them to seat themselves.<br>
The heavy formal robes were drowning Firatha, but drowning the other person also, now seated between Barak and Waylar. And the gloved hands that moved up to remove the cowl...no..not gloved...they were a deep blue-gray, turning more gray it looked than blue. Firatha was trying to still her heart from racing out of her own ribcage and trying to stop from drowning in what she had been brought into.<br>
She was ancient, this woman from whom the cowl fell back from her white hair, and her magick reeked of years and of time and of other things...the sugar in her system, the flowers that had been sent to her upon her arrival, the gentle scent that she wore on her wrists and her throat from her husband, the smell of children and their wraps and their meals. Firatha smelled it all, smelled the greatness of a magick at peace with itself from destruction and decay and all that comes with death...all that her people embraced.<br>
All that Waylar's Teir`Dal wife had shunned nearly six centuries earlier when she had left the Teir`Dal lands in search of freedom, as Firatha had...knowing her magick was not one of sword and blood.<br>
Waylar’s voice was softer than she could ever recall it being...soft and caring and for a Necromancer of great status and standing...she felt tears in her eyes at the tone of it, such was his affection for this woman sitting before him.<br>
&quot;Firatha, may I have the pleasure of introducing my wife, Pequil.&quot;<br>
Calm, matronly eyes looked to Firatha, eyes of one who had seen a lifetime, or, at least, enough generosity and kindness to have erased most of the anger lines that her people so often welcomed as gifts of time. Pequil was not so old that she could not move, but she had not made such a journey out of Qeynos since the birth of her second child, and she was somewhat winded from it all still and begged forgiveness if she was short on breath.<br>
She spoke Firatha's Teir`Dal Name in their liquid language, Barak also bowing to Firatha and repeating a more formal welcome, as did the other four, and Waylar also. It was the first time she had even guessed that they knew her Name, the only time she could ever recall anyone bothering to have asked it. She had been Firatha when they had rescued her from the cell, and Mouse for many, many seasons now to them all.<br>
Her robes were drowning her again, threatening to pull her down to the sands beneath her feet and hold her there.<br>
&quot;How do you know me?&quot;<br>
Pequil's smile was a gracious one, having been cultivated through years and years of having close association with humans who saw through her skin, or were proven wrong after knowing her of their own prejudices. She tapped her forehead with a gentle finger, and an even more gentle, chiding in a way smile. &quot;Child, have you forgotten how we speak?&quot;<br>
A guilty look to them all, and then a silent, even more penitent :No: she passed into their heads, all of them nodding that they had heard her.<br>
&quot;We are mind speakers in the lands of the Teir`Dal, and those humans who can understand us in times of need.&quot; She was looking up to Waylar, with a gentle grin and he gave her shoulder an affectionate squeeze. Some private joke, Firatha guessed, for there was a silent time when they were grinning at one another as new lovers often do.<br>
&quot;I was brought here at Waylar's request to speak to you of options, Firatha, as well as your future here in Freeport. No, no, Child...no...we are not sending you away. Here, come, take my hands, Child, you know I can't lie to you if you grip them.&quot;<br>
It was an old tactic, one often used in the lands during times of true crisis. One Teir`Dal could not lie to another if they were touching due to a smell that they gave off that only another Teir`Dal could detect. Those coupled off with one another would often touch during the early days, when they feared others, or after long centuries, fearing a softening of the relationship and straying eyes. It was the ultimate test of truth, one used on the fighters often to see what they had done on their journeys and how many they had truly killed.<br>
Firatha took Pequil's age-weathered hand in one of hers, and was startled then Barak took the other, with a formal bow again and her hand to his forehead in reverence...one did not kiss the hand of a woman unless you were mated to them. It was not done in the lands, humans or no humans.<br>
Between Pequil and Barak, with four Teir`Dal around her and Waylar just to the side of the elder woman's chair, Firatha felt their emotions, felt the curiosity they felt towards her, and she felt it in return. They felt her betrayal at having not been informed of this, of the fears of suddenly being sent out of the tunnels or worse and their reassuring squeezes on her hands and against her mind were calming her slowly.<br>
Pequil spoke of how she had left the lands much younger than Firatha had been. Her Blood were long known as Knights of Darkness, with sword and blood and bodies in their wake. She had not been of that...she had been the opposite, one who had magicks that did not draw up skeletal warders to assist with battle, but she healed those who were in the sparring matches with her instinctively.<br>
Her Blood was shamed that they had cast a bad seed into life with her. Pequil had known this for many years before escaping with the help of a friend who had died for her to run beyond the forest and into the human lands. She had avoided capture until she reached the mountains, not knowing how far she had had to run to be far enough away from the Teir`Dal lands.<br>
Captured being relative, for she had been found in the woods surrounding the mountains leading to the High Keep. Young Necromancers casting spells at one another in the relative safety that no one would bother them, until one of them kept questioning why his pet was winning the matches and how was it healing itself?<br>
That it had been a much younger Waylar was no more startling than Firatha wanted to believe. Teir`Dal magicks could prolong life, that she knew, for there were many, many humans who came to the lands begging for it. She did not want to speak of what became of them...her own Blood had kept some in the cells below their dwelling for practice.<br>
Pequil had been a novelty to them at first, something forbidden, something new and something feared. But they recognized her for a Healer, which she was, and were now faced with what to do with her. Leaving her was not something that they, despite their youthful ages, could do in good conscience. So they robed her heavily, taking an extra day of travel to send someone under stealth into the Keep itself to find gloves and a veil for her. It was all a farce when they reached the Keep and asked permission to pass through it, Pequil being introduced as the voiceless wife of Waylar.<br>
She joked with a wide smile that he had drawn the short straw in the matter and gotten saddled with her for the duty.<br>
Waylar replied that it was the luckiest loss he had ever taken in his life.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
They had easily snuck Pequil into Qeynos’ Aquaduct System, the Children of Darkness dwelling there all but roaring when they discovered what had been brought into their midst and nearly taking Pequil's head from her shoulders till more sane heads prevailed. Waylar and some of the men who had been journeying ensured that there was always one of their number awake with her in her room. They feared she would be poisoned, or worse, and kept vigil through sleep or wakefullness.<br>
Pequil's healing skills, however, were insanely acurate when she would speak of people walking by her room, stating what might be wrong with them, and Waylar writing down these facts after several days. She could identify what ailed someone and what had caused it, as well as what needed to be done about it. And even after two months, they had no choice but to finally accept, through no asking, that she was right in all her statements. Such was the way her magick worked for her, and such was its price that even those afflicted, not having spoken to her to begin with, they had to admit her truth, and that she had nothing to gain by speaking of them.<br>
Healers were brought in from other tunnel warrens to investigate the oddity that she was...Teir`Dal, and alive, and a Healer. Her magicks were strange to them, but they were still those of a Healer, and in the aqueducts beneath Qeynos, anyone who could do more than bandage a wound was more than welcome. Doubly welcome, for the city was sending people to war at the current time on campaigns on a near-daily basis as people could be Trained and sent out, returning with wounds, illness and sickness of heard and soul, as well as other maladies.<br>
Having gotten her first taste of wine one night, four months after her arrival, and ending up in the same bed with Waylar had not helped the matter. His sense of duty had prompted him to ask for her hand the morning after, to which she had declined, stating she had not sent him away as she should have. Courtesy dictated that he at least provide for her child, if there one came of the union, to which she also stated there were ways to prevent such things and did he not realize she knew all this? It was all another farce, looking back at it, more a dare that Waylar had been put forth to do that had gone from curiosity to fascination to downright how could he possibly be without her?<br>
Pequil's voice was still strong as it filled Firatha’s ears, and Waylar's affection for her very obvious, though Firatha listened with half an ear, afraid she was going to somehow fall into another faint and wake up in a cell again. Pequil...a name she had never heard of, and there was no possible way for her to return to her lands and check with the birth records to determine her story. But her fingers were not glowing with the taint of lies in Firatha’s, nor were those of the Grand Master Knight holding the other hand, nor his men, nor Waylar.<br>
She came to mention that rumors had been coming from the Teir`Dal lands nearly a century earlier, of a Teir`Dal man trying to prove himself by going against the Knights of Shadow of Freeport in a bold move to prove himself Champion over their own as well as his own blood brotherhood.<br>
Not the brighest move of his short lifetime, compared to Pequil’s, Barak noted with a surprisingly light tone for such a legend, and he was grinning as he gave Firatha’s hand another squeeze. But he had left the Teir`Dal lands, somehow finding the tunnels and startling those who dwelled there out of their skull as he appeared before them, leaving the note of Challenge and then vanishing before they could determine how he go in, and before they could find someone who could translate the message. The panic that ensued beneath Freeport for several days was something even Waylar was chuckling over. “Even the Guild was willing to help us exterminate him when they learned a Teir`Dal had been into THEIR city.”<br>
Barak had kept he and his men, numbering nine in all, outside of the tunnels and hidden in the city when the first hints of illness struck them. As with most Teir`Dal, coming into contact with humans was deadly at times, and his men began succumbing to the human diseases. Waylar had been searching for Barak’s hiding place, and two of his own had found it as the Teir`Dal had been weak with fever and shock at having no defense against the unseen. It had been easily done to have a missal sent to Pequil, who returned her own theories for the illness, and ordered that Barak and his men immediately be taken into the tunnels for their safety. And only through Waylar’s influence as an Elder Necromancer did that occur before swords brought an early end to most of them.<br>
They managed to save four men, and Barak, before the illness finally finished its grip on them. Pequil’s missals between Freeport and Qeynos were reported to be moving faster than the normal gossip news network of matrons and small children. Barak’s initial disgust at having both been rescued from illness and then cared for by humans had been more than enough to delay the Challenge, for the time being he threatened, of course.<br>
Waylar recalled, in a rather dry and still amused tone all the same, that Gretta, the youngest of the children in the tunnels at that time who could speak, had walked in on the men on their beds and simply asked, in the hushed tone of children that can wake the dead, why Barak was going to kill her brothers.<br>
Curiosity, and a bit of ribbing, got Barak to speak to her. Despite his Teir`Dal background, his being raised as a killer, one did not take the lives of children...unless they were at true War, and then there were no prisoners, no witnesses. And Gretta, being as children are, would not leave until he gave her a direct answer, to which the usual “why” was asked, and from there it became a moot point as he was uncertain, having no children of his own personally, as to how he could possibly get out of the conversation.<br>
That she snuck back the next day, Gretta gave more to childish curiosity more than anything, or so she said in later years. Barak claimed she was just too smitten by his handsome face and the mind-stunning fact that he enjoyed eating his vegetables. Weren’t they yucky, and wasn’t he proof that if she ate them, the rumors circulating within the children’s ranks would come true and she would turn into one of them?<br>
The Children of Darkness were fascinated suddenly, going from fear of seige to fear of illness to finally fear of lack of knowledge of the Teir`Dal Knights of Shadow. It became a game daily for people to come and speak of what happened there as opposed to what was done in Freeport. Gretta, he recalled, came more often than she probably should have, being much better at sneaking into the room in plain sight and, so Barak claimed, having given him his first taste of berry pie that she had snuck out of the dining area and, not without much mess, brought it to he and his men, for they had none.<br>
Fright went to curiosity then to hard interest, and rumors began floating that the Grand Master Knight had perished on some mission against Freeport, the body never to be found. Barak had spent many long hours debating this with himself and with his men, both in Teir`Dal and in meditation, as to what to do now. To return alive would bring up questions of where they had been, and the first to grip his hand under question would determine they had been saved by humans and with them for a rather lengthy period of time.<br>
Barak was offered a choice...continue with his original Challenge and his men would go free as they pleased, or perish, as that was also an option....however, would they not be more at ease showing some of the younger men how to do that trick with the sword? How to do that vanishing move from one shadow to another? Who, Barak asked, would not have wanted the chance to show others what was easily done from birth? Though it was many long hours of understand what humans could and could not do with their own magick of war and of internal gift.<br>
Hours turned to days and turned to weeks and finally seasons, and Barak and his four remaining men, returned to health and to sword, were more or less a permanence in the tunnels beneath Freeport. It was they who went out with the young Knights of Shadow, testing them in the lands around the city and beyond, returning as they could without a loss by some unknown means that he was also given the title Swordmaster of Shadow, a rank that was somewhat less to his Teir`Dal status, but for him to have returned from so many campaigns without a death, it was of a higher regard now than Grand Master Knight.<br>
As well as coming back without a death meant that he must return the favor that had been glued to his armor by a young woman who caught his fancy. She had assumed the business that her family had left to her after an accidental fire had destroyed most of the docks in Freeport, a careless unloading of a ship bringing death and flames and she had profited by rebuilding under a rather large sum of funds and goods of settlement with the Lord of the city. Gretta’s cooking was already well known in the tunnels, but above, she was hard pressed to keep the business open due to she could not cook and care for the tables and greet each person and did they enjoy dry or wet for their choice of wine?<br>
Barak simply gave her an option...would she like more assistance with the business, something that, in the years to come, would benefit both she and it and help it to prosper? Her reply had been nothing more than setting down her spoon, in the middle of the busy kitchen and staring at him in his armor and sweat and his fingers returning the favor she had given him for another journey.<br>
She had, somehow, missed catching it, and it fell with a rather metallic clang to her feet. The ring attached, as he knew humans held unions, had been the final blow. “Children are assumed to take over the business of the sire and matriarch, no? Have I learned this incorrectly?”<br>
It was the first afternoon she had ever not been in the kitchens or in the guest areas with the many tables, and several from the tunnels were cackling over serving and cooking with the guests that Gretta was indisposed upstairs starting the future owners of the business. She had rapped many a knuckle with her spoon after that, upon hearing it, but with no less well-wishing when it was learned she was rather fertile.<br>
Grand Master Knight Barak....Pequil...the men who had come to fill the ranks beneath Freeport with skin of shadow and with their own blend of swordsmanship and duty. They had been here all along, and Firatha had known nothing.<br>
Pequil’s fingers squeezed hers, and she turned to the matron, to her still kind face and her gentle eyes. “And now, Child, you know about us, and you know there are still some secrets left we can’t speak to you, not fully, until you decide.”<br>
“Decide?”<br>
She motioned up to Waylar. “You have more his magick than mine or Barak’s, for the sword falls from your hands, when it isn’t knocking you backwards with its weight. The robes fit you, Child, and you feel their weight, you think you’re drowning as we all do. The years will take that from you, as they always do. When you become my age, you’ll welcome them for being worn in and rather soft in the bottom when you sit in the libraries to study new spells.<br>
“But your decision must come soon, Child, for we have a problem to date, hence my arrival here, and Barak’s return from abroad. Your people know of you...and they suspect of Barak’s life now, and no we’re not turning you to the wolves, but if it comes to a War, Child, allegiances are going to be asked of you. And it’s our duty to know where each person beneath the city stands, so that we may give them freedom to flee or the duty of defense.”<br>
Defense? Freedom to run? Firatha’s eyes were wild, and she caught Waylar’s glance, his sad look and his nod. “Your brother left our party on our way back to Qeynos, Child, and is missing. The scroll we received, here, not only hours earlier from the lands you escaped from details that there are many who wish War, and want it badly. And they know Qeynos did not fall to the siege, but that doesn’t mean another can’t. They want revenge, and they taste its coming soon.”<br>
“Attack the city? For me?”<br>
“For an ideal, Child, because it is here....and not much else. You would merely be a side event on it.”<br>
Her brother’s words rang in her head again and she felt Pequil’s reassuring squeeze, but it was Barak who was speaking.<br>
“The Knights here have been given my resignation, as I’ve stated that I won’t place any of them in a position of danger. They refused it and said we fall as one, we retreat as one.”<br>
“Despite your skin?”<br>
Barak nodded to her, all seriousness in his eyes now as he looked down to her. “Firatha, you know as well as I do that men will die for a cause they believe just and true, die for something that they believe so heartily that it consumes them, it pushes aside everything else but breathing and sometimes even sleep.<br>
“The destruction of Felwithe, yes, we had a hand in that. I can’t say I’m proud of it, but sadly, I Trained men and women to go there by ultimately doing what I do best...teaching others. I have to live with that for a very, very long lifespan when I try to close my eyes. But they’re hungry, Firatha, hungry for a victory instead of another defeat. Faydwer gave them a taste of victory they should have been content with for centuries, for longer than you and I would be alive, such should’ve been its sweetness.<br>
“But they’re restless again. I have my thoughts as to why, but they’re wanting more. Felwithe has long been an enemy to us...but the human cities have, at least in some small way, accepted that we exist and that if we avoid them, they avoid us. A rather “we know you’re there but if you keep to your city we’ll leave you alone” game of cat and mouse with small skirmishes of one on one when we run into one another in the forests.<br>
“No longer, Firatha. If they sent a direct missal here, to us in the tunnels, they have an idea of our numbers, of what we’re doing, and that there ARE Teir`Dal defectors beneath Freeport. That in itself would probably give them enough incensed anger to want more victories..but something is fanning the flames, and I’ve yet to understand, or possibly guess, who’s doing it. And if my guess is correct, we have a very large problem building.”<br>
“It’s someone who knows, in detail, how many are in the Knights Brotherhood, how many of the Necromancers we have beneath the city, how many are abroad, how many tunnels lead up into the city and where, how many allies we have up there...the letter was very detailed, Child, and we have a just cause to start sending people away in fear of attack.” Waylar’s voice was heavy now, the heavy voice she would have expected from one so old for a human.<br>
That Pequil was squeezing her hand tightly, her eyes sad, glancing from Barak to her husband to the gathered men around them all and then looked to Firatha.<br>
“Child, many things have happened in the lands you fled nearly two years earlier, many things we chose not to tell you, things we have to make you understand now, in a very short time, and I’m sorry for this. Perhaps, one day, you may find it in your heart to forgive us...that will be your own choosing.<br>
“But you must understand that the missal demanded your return for Blood Execution, and it was signed by your sire, who somehow has become ruler of the city we’ve all fled through some devious scheme we’re only beginning to hear wind of. But they demand you be returned for trial and execution...I doubt it would be much of a trial, Child, if you even made it to the city alive. They want you back...you have become the cause of the fires in their soul for some reason we’re not certain of, but mindless causes seem to, of late, be roaming the lands.”<br>
Waylar gave a strange look to that, to which Pequil craned her head backwards and touched his face with a gentle hand and a loving look. “Now stop being all formal with us and tell us what you proposed earlier...she has the right to know what we must do.”<br>
Waylar’s eyes, so kind and still so full of steel after so long. Firatha wondered of the affection shared between them...how long Pequil had waited to cast the sigils on this man to keep him alive for so long and by her side. And Gretta and Barak...it was all something she had never imagined might fire something more than a battle, and the talk of what had happened in Qeynos was legend now, greater in the retelling than it was an hour before...if you could possibly get the whole tale into something less than an hour’s understanding.<br>
“Child....Firatha...you know you are a Child of Darkness...there has been no question of it from Arton, who has been silently overseeing the secondary Training in your magicks. What you perhaps don’t understand was that he was also Testing you for your abilities, and your Training would soon fall onto my shoulders, as well as Pequil’s, due to its strength. Do you have a hint of your power, Firatha? Anything that might tell you that the time has come to decide to remain here with us and defend the tunnels, if it comes to that, or take up your own private war against your former lands?”<br>
He was talking nonsense...Arton had often commented she knew nothing of how he did his magick, that hers came from other means. He often had her simply destroying pet after pet after pet with different spells...from attacks to possible assassinations to smelling poisons to what diseases could be cast without thinking of their consequences.<br>
Arton had been Testing her all along?<br>
Waylar reached over to squeeze her shoulder. “Firatha, with time you may surpass me as an Elder, but for now, as a child and a student of ours, your time being Trained is shortly coming to an end here. There is little Freeport, as the younger of the two cities, tunnel-wise, can do for you other than shelter you. Chiral would be crushed if you abandoned her from the nursery, mind you, but answers are soon going to be asked of you. Loyalties as to which side, if we seal the tunnels for attack, you choose to be on.”<br>
She could only nod, nodding her head over and over and saying nothing, so lost in it all that when she finally fainted with all the possibilities running through her head and fell to the sands, Barak and Pequil were the only things hold her up. And apparently they had been for quite some time when she reflected upon it all later.<br>
But the horror remained...Neriak had sent a scroll, a warning, a demand, to the tunnels beneath Freeport. Even after collapsing, she found she could not sleep. There was no sleep to be found, even after the comforting pillows had been arranged in her room and she summoned a pet to keep guard over her for security of mind.<br>
Sleep would not come. Smelling the tunnels gently as she lay there, eyes staring at the bookcases, she smelled rising tension as others could not sleep.<br>
