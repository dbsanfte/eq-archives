<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1) Travel to North Kaladim and locate Founy Jestands at location +520, +307, -35. Pick pocket the &quot;stained parchment top&quot; from him. He is a rogue GM near the bank.<br>
<br>
– He will despawn at 8 a.m. game time and respawn at 10 a.m.<br>
– He will NOT always spawn with the parchment piece.<br>
– If you get caught while PPing then zone ASAP - the zone is close. <br>
<br>
2) Travel to Neriak 3rd Gate and locate Tani N'Mar at location +650, -1300. Pick pocket the &quot;stained parchment bottom&quot; from him.  He is a rogue GM in the rogue guild hall.<br>
<br>
– He will NOT always spawn with the parchment piece.<br>
<br>
3) Find Stanos Herkanor in Highpass Hold (in secret smugglers camp - must go through underwater tunnel) at location +10, +325,+45. Give him both the &quot;stained parchment top&quot; and the &quot;stained parchment bottom&quot; at the same time to receive the &quot;Combined Parchment.&quot;<br>
<br>
- Stanos was found to have spawned after saying to Anson that &quot;I need to see Stanos.&quot; He will say it better be important and Stanos will spawn if you are not standing on his spawn point. NOTE: you may have to do the pouch method first time though, because you may need high faction for this. <br>
<br>
4) Travel to Lake Rathetear and locate Eldreth in the island tower at location +2600, -550. Hand Eldreth the &quot;Combined Parchment,&quot; 100 platinum, and 2 bottles (unstacked) of milk all at once to receive the &quot;Scribbled Parchment.&quot; If you don't have at least indifferent faction with him, SNEAK when turning in the items. Eldreth will then despawn.<br>
<br>
- Eldreth is a totally rondom spawn spanning anywhere from many hours to a few days (Real Life Time). <br>
<br>
5) Travel to the Plane of Hate to pick up the &quot;Book of Souls.&quot; Located at location -60, +320, the spawn time is 10 hours. The book spawns on the bedside night stand in the bedroom located in the top floor of Maestro of Rancor's building. <br>
<br>
6a) Travel to the Steamfont Mountains and locate Yendar Starpyre (a gnome in an SMR.)<br>
<br>
– Yendar wanders the entire zone so have a tracker.<br>
- Yendar is a totally rondom spawn spanning anywhere from many hours to a few days (Real Life Time).<br>
<br>
After he has been located hail him to keep him from running (saying &quot;book&quot; also stops him) and give him the &quot;Scribbled Parchment&quot;<br>
you received from Eldreth. He in turn will give you another note called a &quot;Tattered Parchment&quot;. NOTE: Yendar no longer despawns after giving him the scribbled parchment. <br>
<br>
6b) After you locate him a second time give him the &quot;Tattered Parchment&quot; and the &quot;Book of Souls&quot; at the same time. He will then despawn and a level 50 female human rogue named Renux Herkanor will spawn nearby (she quads for 200+ and wields a weapon which procs clockwork poison - a spinning stun spell.) <br>
<br>
Quickly engage combat or she will despawn in a short period of time. <br>
<br>
After Renux has been killed, loot the &quot;Jagged Diamond Dagger&quot; and the &quot;Translated Parchment&quot; from her. <br>
<br>
– The &quot;Jagged Diamond Dagger&quot; can also be obtained through a side-quest involving Vilinus the Small (See Side Quests below.)<br>
<br>
<br>
7) Return to Highpass Hold and re-locate Stanos (if he is not up see #3 above) in the smuggler's camp. Give him the &quot;Translated Parchment&quot; you looted from Renux and in turn you will receive &quot;a sealed box.&quot; <br>
<br>
Travel to Kithicor Forest and locate the Dark Elf House at location +800, +2400. Give the box to any one of the night spawns there to spawn General V'Ghera. Pull the General to a safe spot and kill him. Once he has fallen, loot the &quot;General's Pouch&quot; from him.<br>
Also, if he dropped the rare &quot;Cazic Quill&quot; loot this item as well.<br>
<br>
– If he did not drop the &quot;Cazic Quill&quot; you must obtain it through a side quest involving Vilinus the Small (See Side Quests.) <br>
<br>
9) After you have obtained the &quot;Jagged Diamond Dagger,&quot; the &quot;Cazic Quill,&quot; and the &quot;General's Pouch,&quot; travel to Highpass Hold and give them all at once to Stanos to receive the Ragebringer. (If Stanos is not in the camp, see #3 above.)<br>
<br>
<br>
SIDE QUESTS<br>
-------------<br>
<br>
These three side quests involve an NPC named Vilinus the Small. He can be located in Western Karanas in the bandit camp at location +340, -6700. Making him spawn will take some work. First, be sure all bandits are in the camp. You must kill and continue to kill the bandit which runs from the camp to the top of the hill until the &quot;brigand&quot; spawns. The &quot;brigand&quot; is an ultra-rare spawn.<br>
Leave the &quot;brigand&quot; alone, and at 11 p.m. game time Vilinus the Small will spawn in his place. From here, there are 3 sub-quests you are able to complete all of which earn you a different item.<br>
<br>
– The first sub quest will result in the &quot;Jagged Diamond Dagger.&quot; Return to Vilinus the Small all at once <br>
<br>
a &quot;Fleshripper&quot; (from the &quot;Kobold King&quot; in Sol B),<br>
a &quot;Painbringer&quot; (from the &quot;Kobold Champion&quot; in Sol B),<br>
a &quot;Mithril Two-Handed Sword&quot; (from the &quot;Froglok King&quot; in Lower Guk - live side), <br>
a &quot;Gigantic Zwiehander&quot; (from &quot;Karg Icebear&quot; in Everfrost Peaks.) <br>
<br>
– The second quest results in a &quot;Cazic Quill.&quot; Return to Vilinus the Small all at once:<br>
<br>
a &quot;Robe of the Kedge&quot; (from &quot;Phinigel Autropos&quot; in Kedge Keep OR the &quot;Coercer&quot; in Kithicor Forest),<br>
<br>
a &quot;Robe of Ishva&quot; (from the &quot;Coercer&quot; in Kithicor Forest), <br>
<br>
a &quot;Shiny Metallic Robes&quot; (from the &quot;Ghoul Arch Magi&quot; in Lower Guk),<br>
<br>
a &quot;Robe of the Oracle&quot; (from the Oracle in the Ocean of Tears.)<br>
<br>
Note: There is no real reason to do the third quest)<br>
<br>
NOTE: Although the &quot;Side Quests&quot; yield many of the same items as the quest needs, it soley cannot be done to complete the quest. Renux drops the &quot;Jagged Diamond Dagger,&quot; Malka Rale gives you &quot;Stanos' Pouch,&quot; and the General drops the &quot;Cazic Quill,&quot; although the Quill is VERY rare and will most likely have to be obtained though the side quest with the midgit. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub143.ezboard.com/fguardiansofshadowfrm13.showPrevMessage?topicID=13.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub143.ezboard.com/fguardiansofshadowfrm13.showNextMessage?topicID=13.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub143.ezboard.com/fguardiansofshadowfrm13.emailToFriend?topicID=13.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub143.ezboard.com/fguardiansofshadowfrm13.threadControl?topicID=13.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub143.ezboard.com/fguardiansofshadowfrm13.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=13.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub143.ezboard.com/fguardiansofshadowfrm13.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=13.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub143.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="guardiansofshadowfrm10">Guild Bylaws & Rules<option value="guardiansofshadowfrm1">General Discussion<option value="guardiansofshadowfrm4">Public Raids<option value="guardiansofshadowfrm9">Special Events, Etc.<option value="guardiansofshadowfrm3">General Chat<option value="guardiansofshadowfrm5">Guild only Raids<option value="guardiansofshadowfrm6">Guild Roster<option value="guardiansofshadowfrm7">Trade Skills<option value="guardiansofshadowfrm8">Guild Bank<option value="guardiansofshadowfrm2">Officers Chat<option value="guardiansofshadowfrm11">The Flame Room<option value="guardiansofshadowfrm12">Glories Of Old<option value="guardiansofshadowfrm13">epics<option value="guardiansofshadowfrm14">Quests</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#98FB98>- </font><a href=http://pub143.ezboard.com/bguardiansofshadow>Guardians of Shadow</a><font color=#98FB98> - </font><a href=http://pub143.ezboard.com/fguardiansofshadowfrm13>epics</a> <font color=#98FB98> - </font><a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~guardiansofshadow/">Guardians of Shadow - Home</a><font color=#98FB98> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.240<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
