<br>
It was going from the coolness of the tunnels to the instantaneous sweat bath surround the volcano, of blowing ash and sulfur biting at one’s lungs and the heat, the heat surrounding one, crawling beneath armor and robes and the ash settling over everything.<br>
More than one person was suddenly struck senseless with the fact of simply being there, one moment at the tunnels, the next standing in the middle of a bath of heat and fire, the volcano stunning all who had come to witness it, and go beyond it.<br>
Firatha stared at it with little remorse, remembering the times she had been brought here by her Blood to Witness the Rites of Justice...when people were given the choice of suicide in the hopes of redemption to their Blood. Choices, now, she debated mentally, being the choice of one’s parentage and none other and there was no other trial.<br>
She would have come here, eventually, and she tried not to think of that pain of return. She wondered what her brother would have done, and looked impassively at the swirling maelstrom of lava and turned from it.<br>
For Waylar and Pequil, in the lead with Barak, it was a moment of...something more than the visual. For Pequil, gone centuries from the land that had birthed her, it was a homecoming with both a husband and children of both good fortune and kindness of time. What she was thinking, Firatha could only imagine. Several were gathered around them, Arton one of them, in his dark robes and looking around nervously, as if he were seeking the shelter of his library once again and finding it lost to him. She felt pity for them all.<br>
Pequil was standing at the rim of the volcano, closer than probably even Waylar might have wished her, and she was staring down into the red horror that had ended many lives over many many eons. Perhaps she had thought it had gone away, perhaps she had imagined it had, but it was still there, and what she was staring at it, and thinking about it, none could know, for her mind was tight against Firatha and, she noted, probably to Waylar, who was looking to her with concern.<br>
Drathyl moved most of the people away from the crater’s rim, looking around until Firatha started down the nearly buried path, ashes whirling up from the hem of her robes as she went down as she had so many times before. She heard them behind her, in an endless chunk chunk of moving steel and the whisper of robes on ash. Many of the men in armor were itching, hands constantly moving over their armor to perhaps ease the itch of sweat and the heat itself. Drathyl would not allow anyone to remove their armor for fear of scouts nearby and attack. But even he was suffering, and Firatha herself wiped sweat from her forehead.<br>
The base of the crater was, as always, lined with skulls of those who had not wanted to go into the fires and bring Justice to their Blood, to redeem their Names and, perhaps, one day, mentioned again without shame. Firatha stared at them, wondering where her head would have been and wondering how the first one had been placed there to stare out at the living who passed by.<br>
Waylar and Pequil were coming down the crater slowly, several of their children around them. Firatha got her first look at many of them now, some in hoods, some in armor and all looking around with more interest than the others at the bottom. These were her children, denied much of the past of their mother because she refused to speak it, and suddenly they were here, within sight of the forest at the edge of the destruction from heat and ash and flame. What a sight this must be for them, and Firatha, again, wished she knew what Pequil were thinking.<br>
She was startled, however, when Barak met up with Drathyl and those in armor and they waited for Pequil to come to the front. Firatha was staring at the piles of skulls still, to the words she had often heard repeated as curses and enraged shouts...the cries of the damned. The volcano, for all its heat and oppression, was a lovely thing, or, at least, she believed it was, for there was none other that she knew of near Freeport. She had been told by Chiral that, to the known knowledge, there was no well-documented information on volcanoes save for in the halls of the Teir`Dal, and what they knew, they were not stating.<br>
A hand caught at her robe from below, and she looked down for Kerlin and found another child. There had been many, many children running around, and the horror of bringing them had weighed on her, until she now looked down and came into the ageless gaze of a hairless man with a bulbous nose watching up at her. He barely reached her knees, and what she had thought a child was actually a rather old man of such a short stature she wanted to laugh.<br>
“Are you excited about conquering your old city?”<br>
Conquer?<br>
Firatha stared down at the little man, feeling the flush of color against her dark skin, knowing it was lightening with embarrassment and not knowing what to say.<br>
Conquer.<br>
Well...was that not the ultimate goal of every Teir`Dal when they came to true consciousness? That the entire world must be cleansed of all but themselves? It was a rather strange shock to her, suddenly, to remember the words of death and slaughter and maim and how to keep a person alive through light torture...all in the name of a cause to exterminate others, and why?<br>
Conquer?<br>
Oh, yes, her Blood would have wished nothing else but to have the entire city cleansed of anyone non-Teir`Dal. For an insane moment, she thought of the tiger in its cage, and she wondered what might be thought of it. Would they, perhaps, spare it, if they could have? <br>
Irrational thoughts of her own upbringing, of darkness and of the endless cycle of waking, ensuring others were in pain, and then going about the business of bringing it to others, and she was standing so long that Arton finally lifted her up and tossed her against his shoulder as he would have Kerlin.<br>
Firatha’s startled blink, and a moment’s chuckle from Drathyl’s direction, brought her out of her mental misery, and she was deposited near Barak’s men and Arton’s parents.<br>
“Pity you didn’t take her further, Arton, you might have gotten lucky for once.” That from Barak, suddenly agrin with a look that Firatha could not place, and she looked around the ash-strewn land. Where else would he take her? It made no sense to her, and she looked up with a nearly-white face with embarrassment and Pequil’s soft hands touched her hair.<br>
“You’re restless, child.”<br>
She nodded, for there might have been hiding from Arton, but there would be no hiding from Pequil, not with such a powerful mind.<br>
“Into the unknown...nothing more frightening than that to us all.” She noted, though, Waylar’s hand was on Pequil’s shoulder, reassuring her with a gentle presence, and that Pequil’s own words were lighter than normal, or were they simply filled with such a fear that she could not physically put into words before husband and children?<br>
For her children, this was, at last, a homecoming for them. To see what she could not speak to them of, the places she had described on those ultra-rare occasions when she had deemed them old enough to understand something enough for her to state why it was important to her memories to keep them alive. Such a place of death was not one of them, though they were all aware of the volcano because Waylar had teased several on occasion until Pequil learned he was doing it, and it had abruptly stopped.<br>
Another pat from Pequil and she pulled back into her soft robes, looking around her, robes filthy with ashes and hair coated with it and then stopping, staring at the remains of the trees that had not been burned to ash from the volcano’s head, near the entrance to what remained of the forest surrounding the Teir`Dal city.<br>
And she inhaled.<br>
From the pain on her face, she had not done this in a very long time, and her head moved almost without her willing it towards the forest proper, her eyes opening after a long moment and then sightless...then emotionless.<br>
Pequil nodded towards the forest. “The scent goes that way.”<br>
“Then we march to the forest,” Barak replied, moving past Pequil with his four men and then Drathyl beginning to move the others.<br>
Firatha did not want to be in among the armor, for the men were very sweaty and stank of...of maleness and femaleness and of steel and their thoughts were on what would happen if they were ambushed. She remained with Pequil and Waylar who were speaking to their children in hushed tones.<br>
Another hand on her hair and she found a hand tugging at her sleeve. Arton was staring at her, his robes nearly gray, the bright sigils on the hems nearly invisible save for the occasional glow of one or two of them. “You’re uncertain about what we’re doing.”<br>
She nodded, but looked up at him now. “They are all happy to be here...to conquer these lands. Are they that hungry for blood that I brought them here to murder?”<br>
Arton’s eyes watched her, and the sigh that he exhaled was a deep one. He gave Firatha’s hands a squeeze, however, as best he could. “Firatha, Teir`Dal would gladly take everyone, and everything, Freeport has to offer and turn it into a blood bath. You know this, you were there enough days to realize this, if you want to remember. And I know you don’t...I don’t believe I would either.<br>
“But yes...they want some form of justice. Freeport wasn’t the city attacked when Faydwer was involved, and many of them never saw battle in either Faydwer or Qeynos during the siege, but they’re young enough to want it. To want the taste of it and say they’ve been there, without knowing the price of what they ask.<br>
“Do you understand what I’m saying?”<br>
She nodded, but his eyes were still sad.<br>
“Knowing what others want, and knowing what is going to happen, doesn’t make a situation right. Even for Teir`Dal...or humans. And I fear they’re going to get their taste of battle, whether they want it or not. It’d be foolish of us to just think no one’s watching us here.”<br>
She looked around, ashamed, again, at not having searched for others of her own race. They were in the open now, between the volcano and the forest, in the most vulnerable place they could be, and she looked around with fear, and Arton’s grin angered her.<br>
“Barak’s got his men keeping track of any scouts. But do you understand what may happen here? There is probably going to be a battle, there’s nothing we can do about this until we understand why Brisa’s been taken. And where she’s been taken...between you and Barak we only understand half of the city, because for some reason Teir`Dal do not associate with other ranks of their own kind. That is going to be a problem, and how we deal with it...” He gave a shrug, and set a kiss against her forehead before she could do anything about it.<br>
His eyes were kind as they looked down at her again, and before she could speak again, he gave her hands another squeeze and her name spilled from his lips in her own language of darkness and of liquid speech and sound. And he was gone, back to his parents and to his siblings and watching the area as they were as those in armor marched towards the forest.<br>
How had Arton known her Name? Whom else knew it? She was afraid now, but another irrational part of her knew that was silly. Pequil was here, Barak was here, they would have known her Name if they had felt her mind. It was strange to hear it after so long of being “mouse” and “firatha” to them, and she looked up in surprise to Pequil’s voice and her name.<br>
“Are you remaining here or coming with us?”<br>
Embarrassed again, she followed as a child would, looking around as if everything were new and following at Pequil’s side.<br>
Barak’s troops were nearly at the forest when they stopped. The air was a bit cooler here, though the ash was still beating into people’s lungs. Many had tied bandages around their helms and faces to ward off the ash and breathe easier and Firatha tried not to laugh at them, looking all like bandits, especially those in the robes.<br>
She took a tenative sniff, and, yes, the smell was this way. Pequil’s nervous look to everyone was reflected in Firatha’s eyes, and she noted that Barak was also looking rather concerned.<br>
At her height, she had not seen the two Teir`Dal coming from the forest, not over the wide sea of armor and the puddles of robes mixed in with them. That she suddenly was aware of them, however, when Barak called for a halt to the march, and Waylar had his arm on Pequil’s to stop her, almost to hide her it seemed. But her look to Waylar was soft, if not tolerant, and she patted his hand on her arm and looked to Firatha. “Come, child, we have work to do.”<br>
She took Pequil’s soft hand, walking to where Barak stood, the two emissaries from the forest standing at just five paces away. Not a great distance, but it would be enough for them to recognize Firatha at least.<br>
Pequil’s cowl still hid whom she was, but Firatha’s was back and the look they cast her was not one of pleasure.<br>
“Bringing one of our own back for redemption?”<br>
Barak was chuckling. Even he was falling into the old habits, and he reached for the straps holding his helm down, removing it and tucking it beneath one arm. If he had wanted the attention of the two scouts, he had it. If he had wanted to startle them, he had done so. If his intention had been otherwise, Firatha did not want to guess...but the effect on their faces was no less amusing.<br>
“You will respect whom and what I am, for there cannot be another with my Rank and Title until my death.”<br>
“And you are?”<br>
“Grand Master Knight Barak, Sired by Faellok, Trained by Rikyl.”<br>
“So she was correct.”<br>
Barak watched the pair with interest, though all could see the elder of the two was caught between the Laws of bowing to an Elder, especially one with a Rank and Title that had not been seen in several generations. “And she is here?”<br>
The younger nodded to Barak. “She came here to be with her mate. The Elder Council may have allowed her to live for questioning.”<br>
“Now that you’ve horrifed those behind me, you will bring Brisa here, as her Sire, that is owed to me.”<br>
“Nothing is owed to you but death.”<br>
Barak’s quiet chuckle brought more tension than it had meant to. “Come, sprig, fight me at your own peril. You know who I am, and as Brisa is here, for I smell her scent having passed here, then you know what I am. If you have nothing left, come, let us settle this here before these witnesses. If you honor your Sire, return to the Council and tell them Brisa is not yet of an age to be allowed alone, and they know this. Now be gone with you. We wait here for your return.”<br>
To that, Barak turned to the two men, a move that frightened more than one ashen face, but he moved to Waylar, ancient and imposing. It was something that those not Teir`Dal would not have understood, and Pequil’s hand was still on her shoulder, to keep her from running. Had she been more astute, she might have felt the elder woman’s own fingers shaking.<br>
The others who came out from the forest, however, tightened the grip on Firatha’s shoulder, and she tried not to show her own fear at the show of strength coming towards her.<br>
There were nearly a hundred of them, armed and robed as those following Barak and Waylar were, coming to stand in a single, unbroken line between the ruins of the ash field and the forest’s inviting greenery behind them. Robes and armor, robes and armor, on and on and on it went until they were all lined up neatly, as if this had somehow been planned.<br>
Pequil’s hand left Firatha’s shoulder when two elder Teir`Dal came forward from the line, the two scouts taking their places in the gap left. That Brisa was with them was not such a surprise to anyone more than Barak, for she was in the dress of those dwelling in Neriak, with the sweeping tatters of clothing to expose oneself to their dark hearts and to show they were unafraid of others and try your best for the heart with the first blow.<br>
Brisa, however, had changed in two days, even Firatha could see it. She was not as tall as she had been during the dinner in Freeport at her parents house, during the romp through the city she and Firatha had taken and seen the tiger and all the smells and sights. If anything, she seemed to have shrunk into herself somehow, and her eyes seemed luminescent. Her skin would always have the appearance of being darker than others, a gift from her mother but always sensitive to too much sunlight, as her father was. She was wearing neither robe nor armor, simply standing between two elders, dressed in what would have better suited one of the courtesans in the Lord’s court after the brandy had been finished.<br>
“Sire,” was all she said, staring at Barak as if she were meeting him for the first time.<br>
“I have another Title to you, Brisa, one somewhat a bit less...formal. And whom am I to give the rights of your deflowering to?”<br>
“That would be me,” came from one of the robed ones, stepping forward with a scarred face and a hard look to Barak. “She has been with me the past two cycles on and off, and decided to finally join with me here.”<br>
The look on Barak’s face was reflected on those lined as a defense of the forest. His words were chosen carefully, if a bit strained. “You have been bedding my daughter for the last two years, without acession of her Sire, myself, nor the blessing of the Elder Council for what is surely an act of Betrayal?”<br>
The dry laugh crushed Barak as no sword blow could have. “We have a son to prove the union already.”<br>
Barak’s eyes looked to Brisa, to his eldest child, his oldest daughter, the one who had come climbing into his lap despite his armor and his skin and demanded to be up because she wanted to be held by him when she was toddling on new-found feet. “I am a grandsire now?”<br>
Brisa’s eyes were hard, but she said nothing. The one in the robes was continuing to answer for her. “He is nearly two cycles now, reared here as should be.”<br>
“You’ve been seeing a Teir`Dal for two YEARS?! You got pregnant by one?”<br>
The man’s chuckle was echoed around the line. “And you have done differently with your human whore over the cycles? My mate’s Blood is a bit thinned, but our children will be full of Blood and of future deeds.”<br>
“Death, poison, black deeds...I know the litany,” Barak replied in a harsh tone. “But the matter remains...under your own Council Laws, a Teir`Dal may not consort without the permission of her Sire for the sake of Bloodlines.”<br>
“Yes, but a halfblood is not a full Teir`Dal, and does not fall under those qualifications.” That from one of the elders, watching Barak with laughing eyes. “The Laws state justly, as you have thrown back upon our ears, but your daughter is half of our precious Blood, and half scarred with the other blood within her. We are attempting to cleanse her as we can.”<br>
Waylar came to stand beside his son-in-law, looking at the line and giving them a long look before speaking. “I am known to your Blood and your People.”<br>
The elder nodded to that, for Waylar, despite being a Necromancer, the ultimate bane of the Knights of both Qeynos and Freeport, of anyone who stood for the Light...he was also a caster to be respected, for he was a representative for the Children of Darkness, as well as simply just a man trying to help his granddaughter.<br>
“I am immensely curious, as all humans are, as to why Brisa came here, to your People, without informing anyone. She is of the age we all were, and wanting the caress of a male, but is this something she wishes? No,” he said, his voice commanding when the scarred one in the robes opened his mouth to speak. “Brisa is part of my Blood also, she is part of me in some sense, for without my seed, she would not have come to be through other unions.”<br>
He looked directly to the young woman, her dark hair shrouded with a white veil. “Brisa, this is your grandfather, the one who bounced you on his knee, the one who changed your wraps when you were no more than a hands-span long, who gave you your first puppy and dried your eyes when you fell on the stones in Qeynos. Is this what you wish? To remain here, with this Teir`Dal, and the son you’ve produced between the two of you?<br>
“Before all as Witness, is this what you wish?”<br>
Brisa’s head turned slightly, still staring at Barak, and she looked to Waylar. Her glance to the robed man behind her was not missed by any, and with a haughty toss of her head as any teenager would do, she met her grandfather’s eyes. “I don’t want to be human, I want to be Teir`Dal and stay with Grath.”<br>
“You fully understand, that by doing so, you turn your back on those who brought you life, and cared for you? There will be no leaving the city of Neriak once you turn from us here and follow the man who gave you a son?”<br>
She nodded without hesitation, and Pequil was beside Barak. The man was barely breathing, so stunned, his face coated with ash and sickly white-gray from shock.<br>
“You have been made aware of what may happen to you, eventually, in Neriak? That you are not a true Teir`Dal...and will never be?”<br>
Her chin rose a bit at that, defiant eyes looking to the elder Necromancer. “I know what I’m doing...I’ve been doing it for nearly three years now, and no one needed to know what I was doing but me. I can take care of myself.”<br>
Waylar gave a dark sigh, but nodded. “You are Grath?” The one in the robes with the scarred face nodded to Waylar. “You understand what you are about to do to her?”<br>
“She knows the risks.”<br>
There seemed no more to say, and Barak was staring at his daughter, his eyes asking the silent questions his voice could not. Brisa, for her part, was saying little, but her whole attitude of uncaring, of nonchalance and of arrogance was choking her father. All children must grow up, and the last to know are their parents, but the ultimate grief of every parent to know their child has made a choice that will doom them somehow...the decision to let them to their fate takes years from lives.<br>
Brisa was staring at him also, eyes hard. “Why did I do it? You didn’t think I’d ever find anyone who would want me for a wife? Anyone who’d give me the time of day without being afraid of who you are? No men coming up to me wanting to lay with me because they want to know if a Teir`Dal woman can pleasure them easier than a human can? I wanted this...I asked for it...and it’s what I’m going to do.”<br>
“Then you are my Blood no more,” Barak was saying, his voice steel-strong, the anger coming to crest at last. “You have chosen, you have proved, and you have become anew...” The words, after so long, so many cycles away from the city where he had lived and trained and killed...the words were still beaten into his mind and on his lips. “You are no longer Blood of my Blood...you have become one with another.”<br>
He gave her a harsh salute, eyes dead, and turned from her, giving her his back, as those who were shunned were given in a final tribute before they were told to seek the volcano, or worse. But those staring at Barak for that moment saw the tears he was fighting back, the choking, crumbling emotions on his face he was struggling to keep behind his mask of steel facial muscles and duty.<br>
Brisa was no more staring at her father in shock then those around them who had come to rescue her and return her to Freeport. “You can’t shun me! I’m your daughter!”<br>
The elder was looking up at her, eyes amused. “You ceased to be his Blood when you came to be with us. It was explained to you.”<br>
“He can’t just tell me he’s not my father!”<br>
The elder was laughing at her now. “He just shunned you from both his Blood and his dwelling. Witnessed before us, and we do not forget.”<br>
Her eyes were staring at her father’s armored back, to the robed man behind her in the line of Teir`Dal and then to those who had come wanting to find her. “He can’t do that..he’s my father.”<br>
“You have no Sire...you are one of our Blood now.”<br>
Barak was moving, having slammed his helm back on his head and moving back towards the volcano, calling out to his men that their business here was done and they were to return when the casters could arrange their safe transport.<br>
Brisa watched him going, stunned, unable to move and finding herself held by a spell, looking back at the Teir`Dal behind her and then to the people before her, Human and Teir`Dal and Gnome and the infamous Erudites...they were all looking to her for a moment then, as commanded, they started moving towards Barak.<br>
Waylar gave the two elders a moment’s nod of his head, if for nothing more than respect for their status, and turned, taking Pequil’s arm and leading her towards Barak.<br>
The hiss behind them brought them all to a halt. “YOU! You LIVE?!”<br>
They turned, Waylar and Pequil, to the elder, human and dark elf looking to him, as he had finally taken a step from Brisa. They noted, in some strange conversations later, trying to piece it all into one motion, that Firatha was near one of the gnome casters, speaking to him quickly, and Arton was with her.<br>
Lifting himself taller, Waylar looked at the elder. “I have been alive for many cycles.”<br>
“HER!” The elder’s finger stabbed out from his ceremonial robes covering his armor, to Pequil, who was smiling wickedly at him. With slow movements, she pushed her hood back from her hair, revealing herself, and was smiling at the elder.<br>
It was a triumphant, slow smile that she gave the robed one. “I am alive, yes, did you believe me dead, Rikyl? Perhaps a bit less swordplay and you may know where all the children you’ve sired are.”<br>
Barak was staring at her, at the man he had not recognized as his own Swordmaster. But that he had recognized the hooded, robed Pequil...as his own child? Gretta’s mother had been Sired by the Swordmaster, the one who had given Barak the Title of Grand Master Knight in forfeit for his life that he could continue to train the young ones? No wonder Brisa had been easily coerced, for she was partly his Blood also; it made sense now.<br>
Waylar was staring at the elder also, his hand on Pequil’s arm protectively. “You are the Swordmaster?”<br>
“I am her Sire.”<br>
Pequil was shaking her head, smiling at him. “You are no sire of mine...once Banished, there is no going back. To take credit for what I’ve done so far, you have no right to anything. You are not of my Blood.” To Waylar, she looked up with a loving face and took his hand, turning back to the elder. “I have Blood, I have made Blood with Waylar’s seed, and I have Life. I am Pequil, and I am wife to Waylar, mother to many, and no child of the Teir`Dal no longer.”<br>
The spell was cast before anyone could move, a haze of green and choking and lack of air and burning lungs. Several others were casting as the poisons were unleashed, many rushing to the nearest caster and going close as swords began to be drawn and the confrontation deteriorated.<br>
In the middle of the chaos was Barak, suddenly protecting his wife’s parents and their children and where were Arton and Firatha?<br>
The little gnome who opened a portal for them ignored Barak’s roar that they were forgetting people, that others were being left behind for their safety. But there was a moment’s look, at spells being cast upon the Teir`Dal, choking themselves, some crouching down as if seized by a hand and slammed down, others falling from an unseen foe.<br>
The familiar halls of Freeport came around them, the guild of the Casters surrounding them, and they were moving, as others were appearing around them. Barak immediately started looking, counting heads, demanding Drathyl find everyone who had gone with them.<br>
They were missing three...who appeared only after the little gnome could finally remember the spell to get Arton, Firatha, and himself back to the city. Choking, coughing people were all around the room, and windows were opened insantly to let fresh air in.<br>
In the middle of it all, Barak finally found a chair and fell into it, sword clattering to the floor and his helm nearly cracking the marble flooring, closing his eyes and setting it in his hands, wondering what he had done, as a father, to have lost one of his children so early in life.<br>
