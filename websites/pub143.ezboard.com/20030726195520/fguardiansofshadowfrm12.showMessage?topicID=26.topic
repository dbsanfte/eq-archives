<br>
Drathyl took over the duties of having to search for Brisa, as Barak, stunned with the fact that his eldest daughter was missing and even he could not determine where she went...Barak turned from Grand Master Knight into a simply stunned father sitting in a chair shaking his head often to himself.<br>
Brisa was a beautiful young woman for half Teir`Dal and half human, and Firatha heard many of the men noting, out of ear-shot of Drathyl and Barak and Waylar and anyone with authority, that she was probably doing her usual and snuck out with her latest man. What that meant to Firatha was certainly not what it meant to the men, and having no idea of what it meant she sought out Chiral in the nursery as people assembled to search for the missing young woman.<br>
The nursery was in a state of near chaos for nearly all the parents of children of any age below twelve had been left there with Chiral and her two helpers, anyone over the age twelve asked to assist in the search any way they could. Children, it was often known, heard things, could see things adults missed, and Chiral’s look of gratitude that Firatha came to the room was more than she could bear to abandon.<br>
The children swelled the room, and some were in the storerooms themselves, amusing themselves with what they could reach and Firatha was assigned to a large group to keep them entertained while men and women outside the door ran, walked quickly, spoke in strong terms and loudly whispered voices that Firatha could understand everything. Sometimes it did not help that she could hear them all, smell their fear and their emotions.<br>
Kerlin had been at Gretta and Barak’s, brought back to the tunnels with Arton and, as she had expected, left in her care...or so she had thought he would be. Where Arton took his young son other than the nursery, Firatha assumed to herself that it was his choice as he was Kerlin’s father, but it was strange. She found herself missing the little fingers tugging at her robes, though there were enough little fingers doing that in the nursery anyway.<br>
Gretta was in the tunnels, not Barak. She had left her husband with the children in his state of shock and come to help. She brought some of Brisa’s clothing for the dogs to sniff, as well as over and over and over again re-counted what she had done after the evening meal with her eldest child and had wished her to bed. With a painful voice, she stated that she had not checked on Brisa, for it had been assumed she was sleeping. When she had gone missing was within a matter of hours now and not a handful of events sadly.<br>
Waylar and Pequil helped keep their daughter’s sanity as best they could, and Arton was with his sister for whatever she needed, for this was their granddaughter, their niece who was missing and of their Blood. It hurt something within Firatha to watch Gretta crying against Waylar’s robes when they thought no one could see her doing so, and Pequil moving closer to hide her daughter’s tears from others, even though everyone knew it was healthy to cry.<br>
Towards the noon hour, Arton came searching for Firatha in the nursery, apologizing desperately with Chiral, but stating that Firatha was needed. Chiral could not, within good conscience, hold Firatha in the nursery and nodded, gripping Arton’s hand in hers with a brief embrace and his pained face looked aged.<br>
So Firatha came to stand with Drathyl, with the four men she had met the previous day, Barak’s Teir`Dal men, and looked up at Pequil who was standing in her formal robes and looking at them all.<br>
Drathyl’s voice was unsteady to them all. “The dogs haven’t found anything, so we’re turning to you, who have better noses, especially you, Firatha, as you remember the route you both took through the market, which isn’t helping with the search, as you both wandered far. We need any lead you can possibly provide us, any of you. Anything, any possible new scent would help, something out of place, something that may tell us did she leave on her own, was it magick, did she run into something? We’ve checked the cells, but she’s not there in the city above us, so we know they haven’t taken her.”<br>
“We need something more than the dogs, which don’t have the mind to check for more clues than a simple scent,” Pequil was saying softly. “The dogs know where you both went yesterday, Firatha, as well as she was in the house, but as to what happened after that, we don’t know if she left on her own, as sometimes young children do in rebellion, or she is truly in danger to herself from another’s actions.”<br>
Firatha was assigned to the area beneath Barak and Gretta’s eating business, for of them all, she had known where Brisa and she had wandered in the city physically. The dogs had traced most of their route, though, she noted, their journey towards the Lord’s residence was missing, and she noted it to Drathyl and Pequil before she went off to search. Her vivid memory of the tiger on display was too graphic for her to forget it.<br>
She moved into the shadows between torches and mage-summoned lights, closing her eyes and taking on the mantle of her Blood, the world-reknown skill of being able to smell, to sense anything for leagues at times if the wind was blowing in the right direction. But here, in a city, there were too many scents for even the dogs to keep an accurate trail until Firatha had mentioned some places they had stopped the previous day.<br>
The Mouse closed her eyes, breathing deeply, inhaling shallow and then very deeply as she had been taught, concentrating with both memory of scent and light magick that was long bred into her Blood.<br>
She turned in a brief circle, staring at the wall in front of her, and taking a deep breath. If she was truly a Necromancer as they had Trained her to be, it was time to become one. She took the bones from her waist pouch, summoning the skeleton with ease and knowing she had already broken the most sacred rule when smelling for someone...make no noise.<br>
She moved in near-silence, the skeleton a whisper behind her as she turned east, heading through the tunnels after the scent of the dessert she knew Brisa had had two bites of because Gretta had demanded it of her daughter. No one else had been given the turnovers, for Gretta had baked them especially for the family’s consumption, and that was the last thing, anyone knew, Brisa had eaten before being sent to sleep.<br>
Travelling without care, for she could easily find her way back to the main tunnels, Firatha became her namesake, moving fast without sound and seen briefly by none save for a whisper of air that one search group probably felt against their skin. Let them wonder, she would berate them later for their noise.<br>
The scent changed, however, the scent of berries and hand-made sugar pastry and Firatha stopped at last to look around her. The tunnel had come to an end, but the scent was still faint. She touched the stones, holding her gasp when they swallowed her hand and she pulled it back as if from a water barrel.<br>
A false wall...leading where, she wondered? There was no one with her to second guess her judgement, and she gathered herself within her robes, casting the breathing spell should she require it and looking nervously to her pet. She walked through the liquid wall, coming into being, of all places, into familiar territory.<br>
Into horribly familiar territory.<br>
Long thought to be the birthplace of the god her Blood revered and sought to kill for, the volcano several leagues from the city was a place of testing for young Teir`Dal with their skills when it was felt they were ready to risk death. The stench of minerals caught her nose and she gagged, though she knew she could breathe freely with the spell on her being. The pet, she noted, had followed her, but for what purpose?<br>
There was a portation wall beneath Freeport....to the lava pit? Why? Why here of all places, because there was no free passage from the volcano but through the Teir`Dal lands which were heavily guarded and murky with fog and lack of light.<br>
The scent of berries and sugar pastry, however, was here. The need to find Brisa was overwhelmed, however, by the need to bring others. If something had taken her to the Teir`Dal lands, Firatha was not safe to go there on her own, not to survive anyway. She dismissed her pet with a quiet spell, gathering up the bones again and sending herself back to her familiar room in the tunnels and startling Pequil and Gretta who were there in a quiet area consoling one another.<br>
That there was a portal wall was no more startling to Waylar and Drathyl than the notion that it led to the volcano’s flanks, but where it was drained the color from Gretta’s face. Someone was sent to bring Barak to the tunnels, as they would require his assistance now, and the searching parties were being called back also. Someone, Arton of all people, brought something for Firatha during the mess, taking her to a corner of her own room and seating her with a tray of salad and some ice cream and stating she needed to eat something before she continued. The concern in his voice was full of pain and gratitude at the same time, and she noted he had his own tray to eat with her so she was not alone in doing so.<br>
Barak’s appearance with his four Teir`Dal men brought more tears to Gretta’s eyes and he gripped her hand tightly, stating that the children were in the nursery beneath the tunnels and that the business was in the hands of two able women who would run it as if Gretta were there herself. His eyes met Firatha’s though over her bowl of salad, sitting beside Arton in the corner, and he was pained as he looked to her.<br>
“Were that she’d been out with one of her beaus last night as usual,” he cursed in a hollow voice to the family and friends gathered there. “But now we have a direction to go in.” He thanked Firatha for the lead she had given them, though she noted the worry on his face, as that of the men surrounding him, as she felt the fear in her own heart. To return to the lands they had all escaped from was a death sentence if they were discovered, and only by entering the city would they know what had happened to Brisa. To be father and leader of the search party...Firatha did not think she could ever be that strong to offer to do so.<br>
Arton pointed out that she had not even touched her salad, and that her ice cream was cream and nearly overflowing the edges of the bowl now. Firatha looked to his teasing tone and gave a reluctant nod, for she was hungry, and she forced herself to eat, for she also knew there would be no rest anytime soon, not with all these people in her room, in whatever free room could be found it seemed, trying to hope for something positive to be found of Brisa.<br>
Barak and his four men volunteered to go alone, though Firatha stated they would need her as none of them had been to the city in several decades.<br>
To her utter shock, however, Pequil stated she was coming also, a statement that they all noted brought a whiteness to Waylar’s face that matched his hair. “They can’t heal themselves, Waylar, and I am Teir`Dal other than wife and mother. This is my granddaughter, and it’s my right to know why her scent is there. It only makes sense.”<br>
“We both go,” he warned her in a tone that gave no room for debate, and she nodded, quietly sipping her tea and holding Gretta’s hand with the other<br>
The speed with which Waylar asked for volunteers was probably faster than the speed of gossip and rumors in the tunnels, though he gathered as many as he could in the largest of the tunnels and stated what they knew so far. He warned them that there was a good possibility of death, and that those with families and children may want to reconsider volunteering. That was no slur on them, merely that orphans were always finding their ways into the tunnels to either be returned to the surface to a holding residence or enfolded as a Child of Darkness. But Waylar did not want to produce a generation of orphans for the sake of his granddaughter’s life.<br>
He asked for volunteers who might not be attached to anyone, guaranteeing no one’s life, and stating they would need anyone who might want to come assist in the search. Firatha smelled his anguish at having to turn away several people, all with families despite being swordsmen or magickally inclined, as he feared the death count would be heavy in the Teir`Dal lands.<br>
She herself knew they would be, simply for where they were about to journey to. But Waylar asked several hours delay, stating that he had to speak to someone and with a squeeze to Pequil’s shoulders he was gone in a shhhusssh of his robes on the stones, one of the first noises Firatha had ever recalled hearing from them. The magicks keeping them silent were, obviously, rather disturbed also now.<br>
As it was, it would take several hours, several painful hours of agonized mental concern from Gretta and Barak, to assemble a force to head down the tunnels to the false wall. Armor was sought for those who did not have nor had come to the tunnels from abroad with their own. Those of robes and silence were summoning magicks that made Firatha’s nose twitch with the new smells of old, new and unknown magicks. Arton ate quickly and left her in the corner with a squeeze to her shoulder as his father did and racing off to do something anyone could only speculate. There were so many people running about Firatha had a difficult time keeping their scents apart<br>
But several hours passed before she could know it, and the salad and ice cream were long gone from her stomach, and upon going to search for something else, she found Chiral in the eating areas gathering anything she could to feed the nursery. Firatha helped her with several trays of food for them, finding nearly nine people there trying to keep more children in line than Firatha had ever imagined lived in the tunnels to begin with. <br>
That Chiral did not ask her to remain was Firatha’s first warning that something was amiss. “You’re needed elsewhere,” had been her vague statement and she had shooed Firatha away. She did note, however, that Kerlin was not in the nursery, for he would have known instantly if she were there. It was something Firatha had, as yet, not determined how he did so, and gave it to a child’s intuition.<br>
She shuffled back to her original destination, desperately pressing herself against the wall several times, as did others, for troops moving towards the gathering area, where they were assembling for the journey. Firatha was suddenly struck by the fact that they had no clue how Brisa had been taken, and this was quickly turning into a war.<br>
It was somewhere close to the evening meal when Firatha ran headlong into Waylar, returning from his journey, and he steadied her with a hand to her shoulder. “Easy, Child, we have work to do still, and our time is coming.”<br>
The three men behind Waylar, however, were none she had ever seen. Two were in armor, one was in formal wear that spoke of well-done tailoring and wealth, but she knew no better and simply stared at them. They did not smell of the tunnels, and the youngest of them was staring at her and the grip on his gleaming sword frightened her.<br>
The other with him, however, had already unsheathed his and was aiming for her and Waylar’s movement against his arm sent it clattering to the floor with a rage of words she had never heard from him, a power she had not known one of his age might possess. “You are guest here! And she is one of ours...pity you kept her chained like an animal instead of seeing if she had a mind to match her life.”<br>
The man looked rather embarrassed, but Firatha could smell the rage building in him, the rage of embarrassment, of being in the mere presence of a Teir`Dal and not having the ability to take her life. She tasted his embarrassment turning to the scent of silent anger and then to something she had never smelled before, something someone would tell her many years later was the scent of human revenge.<br>
Waylar motioned to the sword on the stones, the well-dressed man speaking in slow, formal tones to the armed man and telling him to take up his sword, as they were guests, and he would keep it sheathed until he was told otherwise.<br>
The youngest of the three was staring at Firatha also, but his eyes had a fire in them that frightened her more than the other’s actions. This man had seen her race before, she could smell that, and she shrank deeper against Waylar’s robes behind her, feeling both his hands on her shoulders now as she desperately felt herself falling back on the old techniques and wanting to hide from him.<br>
“She has been one of ours since before Faydwer, Tallik, since we took her from your jail, and I will not have her judgement questioned. She found the false wall and came back with where my granddaughter is.”<br>
“Why’d she hafta be one of the inkies, though, Waylar?”<br>
The name meant something to her, but she could not quite recall where she had heard it, but his armor was a deep silver, and it glowed with something she could not identify. She would be told later it was the blessing of a god she had never known existed.<br>
Waylar took Firatha against him and moved her back in the direction they had been travelling. “We’re gathering in the hall, Mouse. Run along and find Barak and tell him we’re coming. My bones don’t move quickly any more.”<br>
“Could’ve fooled me,” Tallik was grunting, and she looked up at Waylar in fear and was running from them before he could have possibly stopped her. Running as if there was nothing behind her but death itself and she came to a crashing halt, again, with the wind knocked out of her and herself on the stones at Barak’s feet. They helped her up, Pequil smoothing out her hair and sniffing her suddenly. Her eyes were wide as they looked to Barak, then she sighed.<br>
“So, he’s involved them in this.”<br>
“They won’t assist us in this matter, Pequil, this isn’t their affair.”<br>
“True, but they have a right to know what may happen beneath their city, Barak.” She was stroking Firatha’s hair, inspecting her scalp for bumps and finding none. As she had often done with her own children for her self need, she pulled Firatha against her robes, the magick in them soothing Firatha as well as near-hiding her against them.<br>
Pequil had been correct...her formal robes were very, very old, and they were dreadfully soft against Firatha’s hair and her face when she turned it to the side. They felt softer than the pillows she loved to sleep upon, softer than the robes she herself had been given to “break in”. She did not know anything about “mental anguish” or a “need for security” or anything that humans often gave their children, but she found herself seeking nothing beyond the edge of Pequil’s robes, the woman’s hands on her own shoulders, and she wondered what magick had given the elder woman such height.<br>
Waylar came into the hall with the three men, Barak and Drathyl foremost staring at them, and it was an uneasy silence that fell over the hall, disrupted with shuffling feet and the smell of fear a blanket that caught Firatha’s heart again. She did not know who the three were, other than two of them wanted her life, only that one knew how to hold his swordarm and the other did not care.<br>
With an uneasy motion, Barak and Drathyl gave a bow to Waylar, as befitted his status as Elder Necromancer, but their eyes never left the three men. Firatha noted no one’s eyes left the men, and one of the Teir`Dal in Barak’s command was shifting uneasily from foot to foot.<br>
“Tell us what you know, and we’ll see what we can do, if we do anything for, or with you.”<br>
“Welcome to you also, Tallik,” Barak said in a hard voice, and the man in gleaming armor gave a sigh and pushed back his dark hair.<br>
“You know well as I do what’ll happen in the Guild if I even say the word Neriak, Barak. After all that’s happened you of all people should know that. Bad enough having to clean up the mess it was left in, but the bucks want their revenge and I whisper a word of what’s happening and you can forget any stealth you might’ve thought of. Mylissyl’s trying to keep my disappearance to a minimum, but we’ll see what happens.”<br>
The two men were looking to one another, one human, one Teir`Dal and Firatha felt something was happening she could not understand. Tallik gave a shrug and sighed at last after a long silence. “I know I’d be out there slicing every throat I thought was involved if it was my girl, Barak. She’s all over the place now that she’s walking.”<br>
They both nodded to that, and Barak began with the dinner, when they had last seen Brisa and the journey to the market with Firatha...she noted they were calling her Mouse. Who was in the tunnels that did not need to know her name, she wondered, and Pequil was stroking her hair again in silent motions, soothing her with magick and motion.<br>
The man in the well-tailored clothing asked few questions, but they were direct and she noted that the man with the sword who had tried to attack her was constantly looking around the room for anything that might give him a reason to release his growing anger. His eyes found her again and she tried to hide further against Pequil’s robes, but she had only to look up and see the dangerous look on Pequil’s face as she pushed her cowl back, revealing her face and watched his eyes grow in shock and then she held up her hand, clenched in a fist and wrist showing, and then lowered it after a long moment.<br>
The motion caught Tallik’s eyes, and he looked over, startled. “Peekie? You’re here too?”<br>
Firatha looked up, one white eyebrow questioning, and she nodded.<br>
“This is my granddaughter, Tallik. Where else should I be when it involves the land I left to be a human whore to a necromancer?”<br>
The horrified silence that followed...Firatha thought every man in the room was going to kill Tallik, but Waylar was chuckling beside the well-dressed man, as was Tallik, and Barak and Drathyl were grinning.<br>
“I know, I know, you’ll never let me forget that. But are things that bad you’re here and not in Qeynos? Roderick should know if you’re both here and not there.”<br>
She shook her head. “Qeynos has their own scourge to recover from...this is Blood, and goes no further than Blood.”<br>
“And those of us who want to help,” Drathyl added in a firm tone. “And you’re going to allow us to help in the search or we’ll all pool our money together and bleach your robes.”<br>
A horrible thought, one Firatha was shivering within at the very thought of. White robes were for True Healers...there was a rumor there was one in Qeynos now, but she dismissed it. She had had enough of healing for a lifetime.<br>
Pequil was laughing at that, daring Drathyl to attempt it, but she was giving a concerned look to Tallik. “I’m to assume Waylar’s let you know what we’re about to do, and the possible consequences?” The nod she received filled Firatha’s nose with a strange smell from Pequil, one that she often smelled from Chiral, one she had noted from Gretta and from Drathyl and Waylar’s own scent embraced it. Gratitude, affection, it nearly overwhelmed her, and she remained half-hidden in Pequil’s robes, not knowing what to do other than that.<br>
“I can’t offer you troops as I know they’d probably get outta my sight and tear off your head, Barak, but I can try to get some down here in the tunnels to help the ones that can’t go. That’s probably all I can do right now. But all the Teir`Dal are going?”<br>
Another nod to that from Barak. “We’re all going, Tallik...we know the area best, and we can smell what’s coming if something tries to come at us.”<br>
“Same as you smelled that winning hand the other night and bluffed me out of the winnings?”<br>
“You lost as fairly as you entered the game, Tallik...or should I tell Mylissyl about that fabric shipment you neglected to tell her about...”<br>
“Oh no, don’t mention more fabrics,” Tallik was groaning, wincing and rubbing his nose to the amusement of many. That these two men were obviously longtime friends startled Firatha, but as she looked around the great room, she should not have been surprised. It made sense for those in the tunnels to keep a loose contact with those above somehow.<br>
She noted that Waylar was conferring in quieter tones to the well-dressed man, the two of them speaking little things, and she heard them inquiring about children and health and gave a deeper smell and found, to her horror, the scent of tiger on the man. That this was the infamous Lord of Freeport, looking nothing more than an elderly man speaking to another elderly man in robes, that startled her more than their very appearance had. She supposed, in a sense, two men of power were conferring as they should while their battlemen got the motions going, and Pequil bent her head at last and whispered that she was safe, and that Tallik was not going to take her head off, nor was Romney, because if Romney did Waylar would have thrown him over his knee and spanked him.<br>
Firatha sniffed again, trying to sort out the scents and as the man turned his head, she could see Waylar’s nose and his inquiring set of eye and chin, and she felt as if she were falling again. Another of Waylar and Pequil’s children, though his actions had been startling...what had brought him so against Teir`Dal, or did she wish to know? Probably not.<br>
Tallik and Barak were conferring with Drathyl and some of the others over a small table, and Waylar was introducing Pequil, once again, to the Lord of Freeport, and Firatha looked at the many faces and raced from the room. She did not want to be there, so many people, so many things assaulting her nose and the fright growing along with the hint of battle and blood. She wanted away from it.<br>
Her search took her, of all places, to the library, and there she encountered a rather loud shriek and two grubby hands tugging at her robes demanding up. She lifted Kerlin up from where he had been playing on the floor, looking to Arton and his scribes studying any possible map they might have of the Teir`Dal lands.<br>
The look he gave her, however, was one of resigned fear...for himself, for his Blood, for his friends and his family and everything they had worked for beneath the tunnels to keep a peace of silence and semi-darkness.<br>
She moved to him with Kerlin, taking the high-legged seat that someone had found for her a while ago, staring down as the scribes searched tome after tome, and Arton himself was staring at several well-worn parchments, held open at the corners by heavy books. “You know Neriak, Firatha, but we don’t.”<br>
She looked down at the map, wondering why the forest looked so empty of the guard stations and of the wandering routes, and then she realized she was not seeing the forest outside the Teir`Dal lands, she was seeing the commonlands that led towards the desert and then to Freeport itself, or beyond towards the mountains.<br>
“Where is your map?”<br>
“What map, Firatha? Barak only gave us what he knew...the guard huts along the forest outside your former lands...what’s inside, Barak could only give us what he knew...the warrior’s areas.”<br>
She nodded to that, feeling Arton’s frustration and leaning over the table to feed Kerlin part of a sandwich he had not wanted to eat, but now was suddenly hungry, as usual.<br>
Her own Blood had been near the entrance, along the healer’s areas and then along around the pools of water with the sightless fish that had amused her when she saw one.<br>
“Anything you can give us, before the men move out, would save lives, Firatha, even one life saved would be grateful.”<br>
She felt his fear at so many of his own Blood going out to save one of his Blood, and she looked to the map and then reached over to take up his quill, turning over a message scroll and detailing the entrance she had desperately sought to escape from. Memory brought back the darkness, the smells, how many paces from one corner to another and then a left in this direction would lead you here and if you went right you would be in front of here.<br>
By nearly the tenth hour, they were ready to move, and Firatha was leading them down the tunnel again, the map having been looked at by the commanders, Barak adding what he knew of the warrior’s areas and the connecting passages, so that nearly half the city of Neriak was known...the other half, sadly, that of the casters of true magicks, was nothing but a blank. Firatha and Barak silently hoped there would be no need for having to know them. And even Pequil could not recall them well now, images coming back to her as she looked at the map and nodded her approval.<br>
They stood at the false wall, Tallik bringing up the rear with Romney and several of those who were being left behind. Firatha could smell the rising tension, the fear of those remaining and those about to pass into a land they had only dreamt of seeing.<br>
Waylar himself was the first through the false wall with Pequil behind him at a pace, and they went through into oblivion to the unknown.<br>
