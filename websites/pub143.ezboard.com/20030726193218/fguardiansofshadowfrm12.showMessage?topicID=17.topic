Qeynos Called up its own troops, many still in the city assisting with the rebuilding from the attacks months earlier, and welcoming something to do. Erudin’s own, enraged that a beast had entered their sacred Library and taken a guest of theirs without anyone seeing or knowing, they were the first to fill the ranks. Freeport, when the tale went out, sent none, but there were stragglers coming in, Roderick’s own men as well as those loyal to Lady Alamathea and knowing her a just person.<br>
Those who came from Freeport knew their days in the Guild may have ended the morning they set out seeking druids to take them to Erudin.<br>
The Outpost sent its people to Felwithe, promising nearly four hundred strong to be meeting Roderick’s force, though the final number came closer to seven hundred mixed with Belerak’s own Knights who swarmed for the chance at revenge. He had fewer to send due to the injured were still in Kaladim, but those who came were eager to taste blood on their blades.<br>
Roderick Peacekeeper of Qeynos, Knight of Honor and Duty, General of the Knights of Freeport, he spent the two days in a half-dead state trying to read as much as he could, to understand, to meet as many as he could and, in the end, to perhaps understand what he was up against.<br>
In the end, the journal Alamathea had kept was the greatest ally he could have had. More strength came from it than he could have imagined would. Her neat writing, each page free of stains and fingermarks, let to dry before she continued her work...how had she kept the knowledge in her head when the ink was not yet dry and the urge to write it all down was so close at hand?<br>
Each new day’s start began with an empty page with a single dried, pressed flower stuck to it. It tore at his emotions to see it, to think of what he had done to keep up Tiabrin’s silly game. All the years he had kept her away, gone on journeys to stay away from her voice and keep away from her laughter.<br>
He only hoped there would be something for him to admit his wrongs to.<br>
The journal spoke openly, as if she were sitting there speaking to him, as if she had known someone would need to read it and find her. The words were coming in paces...slow and then when an idea caught her, it was studied and then chased to the end. The information was staggering, so much in so little time, but, then again, he knew she had long had a fascination with the undead. Her own studies had baffled the Guild Hall in Freeport.<br>
Had anyone Tested her magick, her healing skills, they would have understood why. Healers are the masters of attack against the undead. Who else to understand them more than she?<br>
She spoke of people coming and going, of the pages shuffling through the Library as little doves seeking shelter from rain, the way that the Library’s silence made her think more because it was that and there wasn’t the noises of Freeport’s Guild and city going on all around her. She spoke also of Gynath’s quiet voice when speaking to her children, of Tallik’s itching his nose when he was nervous, and of Tiabrin’s coming child.<br>
When he reached that, it was no less a roar of astonishment from his mouth so much as from Tallik’s, and any plans Tiabrin might have had to lead a battalion to Mistmoore were taken from her hands. Illiysha was merely grinning at her son and Tallik, having known the young man for quite some time and only grinning. “You could have simply slept with one of my daughters and made it easier on yourself, stead of sleeping with Chathal’s Blood Sister.”<br>
The blush on Tallik’s face after that had brought more than one laughter to a precious moment of tenseness.<br>
Roderick was weeping before he was done the journal, hearing Alamathea’s voice with each page, each sentence and wanting nothing more than to have her back and to hold her, to just touch her hair and know she was alive and well and safe within arm’s reach. He thought of the argument in Felwithe’s tower, the days returning to Freeport and then in Qeynos under siege. Of her walking in silence to taunt the children of Erudin in the Library...why had he waited so long for the obvious? Why?<br>
She spoke of little things he himself had never paid attention to...how he wore his hair, the way the sun gave it colors and how he had a slight limp when it rained from a wound he had taken in his hip as a child playing with the dogs. How he could be kind and courteous to anyone, even if here were correcting them from killing another, and how much he was respected and would be missed were he gone again.<br>
“I fear the day shall come when I must walk away from my dreams, realize it was a child’s fantasy and wake to everything that’s happened. To sire’s betrayal, to nothing but dust in Freeport and to what I am now, nothing more than a woman as all the others are in whatever city I creep into. I can endure those, I have no choice in those but to endure them, because they can’t be changed now. To endure it without him...better to lay myself before the beast’s hands than endure it. But the games tire me, the cat and mouse and can I possibly ask it of him and will he listen this time...will he understand, or is he too far old and hardened as they say he is? Illiysha and Tiabrin spoke of his kindness and loyalties, Tallik that he would die for the man, but is there nothing left for another who might have given up her chance because she was too afraid?”<br>
He had just sat there crying, not even noticing that Illiysha had pulled in some of his own sisters around him to not let the others see his tears.<br>
Illiysha and Gynath became pillars to them all, rousing up both the kitchens for the coming masses as well as rations, water bottles, flasks of healing potions, anything that could be of use to the coming assault. The Healer Halls had also been Called upon, having heard quickly of a young woman who was sought after by a vampire for her healing skills, and of what she had done in Felwithe without rest. The day that she had had to be spoken to in Qeynos, the four months in Erudin confirmed what Tiabin and Illiysha had feared.<br>
Lady Alamathea was a true Healer, one of a strength not seen in several generations, but always welcome when they came. For this, she was needed also by Lord Mistmoore, for one with such power would be able, possibly, to defeat him. And one with that power would not stop until it was done.<br>
Mages and enchanters were brought in also from the Outpost as well as Erudin’s own Magick Halls. It was to them that Lady Alamathea’s theory of confining Lord Mistmoore was given, and it was given two days to either be proven or to be shot down and the assault taking its chances.<br>
Wizened by years of spellcasting and fire spells, Fithel of the Mages Council shook his head and only stared.<br>
“Praise the Highers that it works...here it works, there, under fire and blood, I’m not certain it could be done.”<br>
“Then you’ll get the quiet you need to do it,” Roderick and Lanadan and Chathal had promised, Tallik still sulking over Tiabrin’s hiding her condition.<br>
One thousand eighty nine Knights were then gathered in small groups, via ‘ports and simply marching overland, until nearly the entire burned expanse in front of Felwithe was awash with tents, troops, horses and wolves to search the area for the missing woman.<br>
When it was pointed out, by a rather ill-timed scroll from Lord Narson, that the missing woman had been given to Lord Mistmoore to ensure that the Knights would be left alone, there were many who took a moment to debate this within their hearts.<br>
They had only to look to Roderick burning the scroll above his campfire to know what they were fighting for...The General’s Woman.<br>
Lanadan would lead the second battalion, Tallik the third, Chathal the fourth and Vreaa himself the fifth, having made a sudden last moment appearance in his armor with two of his own sons in tow.<br>
“Does this happen once, no doubt it will happen again, and pity us all if he takes her to undead, as none of us will be at peace again with ourselves in our hearts or our lands. Wars of greater devastation than this one, to date, have begun with the taking of a single life.”<br>
Roderick could only nod to that, having nothing else to say but stare at the glove tied against his armor near his waist. Found somehow by Illiysha, he did not want to know how, Lady Alamathea’s remaining glove from her Freeport armor was held there by several links of chain. With every movement it slapped against his thigh, and he only wished it were harder for the damage he had done over the years.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
It took them nearly three days to get everyone assembled near the ramp leading up to the castle. Roderick and Tallik and their men remembered it well, the gnome lands well devastated in the valley off to one side of the castle. Roderick could spare no pity for them, for Felwithe’s own had already informed him that if any gnomes had survived, they had not yet come out. The ruins were still too hot to enter, for the coal used below to heat the furnaces was still burning out of control months later.<br>
Lanadan, Chathal and Vreaa got their first good look at the castle, the mages coming to look with interest, the enchanters wondering what they were going to do for a safe place to set up their spells. Only Roderick and Tallik, the few men who had been able to sneak out of Freeport to assist them, they were all knowing of what was inside the castle.<br>
Of the castle, it sat in silence. There were no undead guarding the outside, no sounds, nothing but still silence, and the remains of bodies out front that had been picked clean by the beasts that had survived Faydwer’s burning. Roderick wanted the bodies removed for burial, and was told later it would be done, that they would be buried with Knight’s Honor and Duty.<br>
The glove bounced against his thigh, and he stared at the castle, not knowing what to do suddenly. <br>
It was determined that a messenger should be sent up, to at least ask to meet with Lord Mistmoore, but no one had any idea as to how to get up the ramp easily. There were rocks strewn along it, easily moved around, but were an attack to come, they would all become one tumbling mass of bodies in their armor.<br>
The mages brought in their birds, tying several messages to their legs and sending them to the castle, in the hopes of perhaps meeting eye to eye with the elusive Lord of Mistmoore they had heard so much about.<br>
Of the four birds, two were simply blasted from the air without a sound, a third crashed for unknown reasons, and the fourth entered the castle and then flew out the other side, not to return. It was not proving to be a feasable attempt at negotiation.<br>
Tallik volunteered to be the messenger, but Chathal’s loud words to that startled many. He had not wanted Tallik along, should something happen to him and Tiabrin left alone, but he had also understood that to leave Tallik behind would leave behind information that the Knight had seen and he, safe in Erudin, had not.<br>
In the end, there was no choice. One of the lesser mages, young and full of life, offered to go and while the generals were still debating the matter, set off up the ramp so that when they did finally realize he was gone, it was too late to turn him back.<br>
Up the ramp, he was easily seen, moving cautiously with his robes lest he catch one and send it tumbling down the ramp with devastating results. Upon reaching the castle’s bridge itself, he stopped and gave a jaunty wave to those below before visibly crossing it to stand at the doors and was gone from view.<br>
They waited several hours, seeing nothing of his return, and Roderick felt the familiar tightening of his heart that someone young was probably gone from the world again. Lanadan offered to try the next message himself, but he was also refused due to his knowledge would be required once they got into the castle.<br>
Mages brought in their pets finally to clear the rocks from the ramp, taking nearly a day to do so cautiously and the troops off to one side of the valley to avoid them. The ramp was cleared at last, not soon enough for Roderick, often seen tightly gripping the hilt of his still-sheathed sword and simply staring at the castle.<br>
Tallik insisted they wait until daybreak to head for the ramp, and Roderick simply ignored his words. “Day or night doesn’t matter, he’s probably known we were here since we grouped at Felwithe. He knows we’re here, and he has something planned. Our job’s to survive it and get her out.”<br>
Roderick’s own battalion moved out first towards the ramp, followed by Tallik’s and then Vreaa’s. Lanadan’s would come last, somehow put in that position in that if something went wrong, there would be men to head back to Felwithe and warn them to seek shelter in Kaladim.<br>
Getting up the ramp was the easier of the matters on his mind, staring at the bridge he had not had a chance to examine closely the last time he had been here. Old wood, and a gleaming, bright steel that someone was caring for despite time and elements probably having beaten upon it for longer than recorded memories of humanity.<br>
He felt old, weak somehow that he was here, outside the castle, and she was within, doing what he feared he would soon discover, and afraid to know. But to the men he appeared waiting, for some signal, for something go come jump upon him, anything.<br>
What he was waiting for was the doors to open, which, having met the Lord of Mistmoore, he knew they would.<br>
And they did, eventually, after Vreaa’s own men were waiting on the ramp to enter the castle.<br>
Roderick crossed the bridge first, moving through the doors and listening to the sounds behind him, turning to see his own men staring at him as if lost.<br>
He pushed back through the doorway, staring at them. “Come along.”<br>
Again, they could not enter.<br>
Irritation gave way to sudden dread, and he crossed the doorway again, Tallik and Vreaa coming through quickly and staring as he did it again, and the men could not follow. They could not enter the castle, though Tallik and Vreaa were free to come and go as Roderick was.<br>
Chathal and Lanadan were called up, as were the men who had served Roderick in Freeport, and it was discovered that they could all enter, but the others could not. There was no other choice but to leave them outside the castle on the ramp, ready for anything. Roderick’s own were left on the ramp, the others sent down should something happen and with strict orders to head to Felwithe to warn them if something went wrong.<br>
Roderick led the way into the castle once more, again feeling the pain of leading twenty-five strong, including his own sire, into the dark stonework. He feared having to return to Qeynos and face Illiysha if something went wrong, and having to face himself when he woke each morning. He wondered if Lanadan was thinking the same thing.<br>
They came into the same large dining area, with the table and its many chairs, tho Roderick finally had time to count them, numbering thirty, and Roderick sighed, motioning the men to take seats, as he knew what was coming. They had been seated before, and he had a hunch, nothing more, but a hunch.<br>
He himself took the seat across from the host’s chair, staring at the beautifully carved ironwood and wondering who had taken such detail to such a difficult wood to work. Artfully done on all the armrests also, had he been one with an eye for detail he might have inquired Vreaa who might do similar work at the Outpost.<br>
The first they saw of their host, however, was not the Lord Mistmoore they had been expecting, but more Vreaa’s horrified hiss of air through his teeth, warding himself against the undead he had sworn his life to defend.<br>
Telerath, missing since the Felwithe attack, came quietly into the room, looking with dead eyes of a deep red to the men at the table, and taking a rather low bow to them. Lanadan motioned the men nearest Vreaa to watch his sword and keep him restrained if need be, but the elven Knight’s eyes were only on his former ally.<br>
Or, more precisely, what had once been his ally.<br>
There was little shock when Daliea came behind him, also pale and undead now, eyes looking around to the men in a somewhat dazed fashion, as if looking for one who was not there but should have been, and she could not remember why. Her throat, as did Telerath’s, bore several wounds on it, and her red eyes were dull and staring at something above the heads of the men. She would not look at them, nor did she bow. Roderick felt his stomach sinking into a realm he had not wanted to have nightmares of.<br>
He took an uneasy breath, Lord Mistmoore himself coming in after the undead elves and giving a rather formal bow, which none save Lanadan gave a slight bow of the head as acknowledgement. Roderick only kept his hands on the table, some unsightly memory of his mother slapping them off with a spoon constantly coming to mind at his lack of manners.<br>
“I greet you to the Castle of Mistmoore,” he said, no less the gracious host and tall being that had come to Qeynos to speak to the Council. “But, I see some of you have been here before. Ah yes, familiar faces...come to see my wealth and my children again.”<br>
Lanadan took a breath, seeing as Vreaa, the eldest of them all, was not going to speak, and Tallik was nearly out of his char in horror, staring at Telerath and Daliea and his eyes working fast. “We have come to negotiate.”<br>
Lord Mistmoore gave them a quiet look, then turned to Lanadan with his red eyes, and seated himself. “Lord Lanadan Peacekeeper, it was your welcome that brought me to Qeynos, and your thoughtfulness to hear my own words. I will listen, but understand, this is not Qeynos, and I am Lord here, and my word is Law.”<br>
Roderick felt the situation tumbling into an abyss, he knew something had happened, he was stalling for time but had no idea as to why. He had to find Alamathea, he had to get her out.<br>
Lanadan rose gracefully from the chair; he had not been Guild Knight in Qeynos without knowing how to soothe people’s manners. “In Qeynos, it was negotiated that Lady Alamathea Hopeseeker of Freeport be given in exchange for the peace to be held between your realm and ours, and that Lord Narson asked this be done to ensure no further attacks upon cities of innocent people.”<br>
Narson...Roderick looked to Tallik, who had been there for the Charges in Freeport, and both shared a look of dread. Lord Narson was still in Freeport, Lord Narson who had been promised Lady Alamathea by her sire before “being abducted” to Qeynos by Roderick. Surely the man had not been insane enough to throw away a life to keep his position in the Guild as well as sleep at night?<br>
Lord Mistmoore nodded, red eyes looking to them all before answering. “Yes, this was the negotiated price for my leaving the rest of your precious cities. And it was discovered that my prize had been taken away somehow to Erudin under mysterious circumstances.”<br>
“Yes, it was determined that she might wish some time to gather herself before the journey to your realm, perhaps prepare final wishes to those she might not see again...”<br>
It was empty in Roderick’s own ears, but Lanadan was the negotiator now. Even Vreaa was not listening to the words, his eyes still on Telerath and Daliea standing as if true statues on either side of Lord Mistmoore.<br>
The Lord of Mistmoore was now waving his hand at Lanadan. “My Lord Lanadan, I fear that you have been misled in your delusions, as she was not moved to Erudin to prepare, she was taken to Erudin by your own flesh and blood to be hidden. And there were to be no turnovers of her to me, if I am not mistaken now by my own investigation of the matter, as Lord Narson has now brought up that she was promised to him before she left Freeport for Qeynos.<br>
“I might also add that the circumstances to which she left Freeport and then Qeynos seem to also involve your son, once again, on Charges of Abduction and that I myself shall press with Lord Narson to be taken to their fullest abuse.”<br>
Lanadan was pale beneath his armor, and took a long breath before responding. “The Council was agreed to turn her to you...”<br>
“The Council agreed because Lord Antonanth had not yet been Banished, and his vote was the deciding one for turning her over to me. Let us be honest with one another here, for your own peace of mind at night. Had you moved faster to Banish him, or take him from the room, you would not be here, coming to my realm and seeking something your own Council, in your own city, agreed to.<br>
“Something, I shall add, that is now mine, and no longer yours to debate over.”<br>
Roderick stood slowly, staring at the doors opening once again behind Lord Mistmoore, staring at Antonanth Hopeseeker as he came through them, eyes crimson and flesh white, and he came to stand just behind and to the right of Lord Mistmoore’s chair. His armor, it was noted, was not the Guild armor of steel but something more, something black and with a dull glow to it of magick.<br>
“I also have my own Witness to the testimony, who shall back up the statement that Lord Narson was indeed given one Lady Alamathea Hopeseeker of Freeport, however, this goes also against what Antonanth and I agreed to many seasons ago when she was born to him. I was promised a Healer of greatness, and he knew she was at birth, and promised her to me then.<br>
“Lord Narson has demanded her be turned over to him, at least for the remainder of his physical life span, that he might get some use of her for children and then be turned over to me.” Lord Mistmoore shrugged. “What is a decade or two for the ageless?”<br>
Roderick’s slammed hands onto the table brought all eyes to him, whether intending to or not, and stared at the vampire. “Where is she?”<br>
“She is sleeping, currently, in the semi-awake state you might call coma, between the worlds of the living and the dead. Until I decide Lord Narson’s claim, she is as I have told you, for I will not allow her to be conscious to cast something again within these halls that I do not ask of her.”<br>
Tallik closed his eyes for a moment in pain, Vreaa’s noise of despair bringing a look from the undead Telerath but no recognition to it. Roderick felt the years coming to pounce upon his bones at last, and his men were struggling to keep themselves in their seats. They had been with him on the sands, coming here to retrieve her and then the horrors in Felwithe and Faydwer. They wanted their own revenge.<br>
He would give it to them, in time, he knew this.<br>
What he did not expect was for Lord Mistmoore to turn his head slightly to one side, as if debating some matter in his head, and then push his chair back, looking to the doors to his left.<br>
Years later, there was only pieces put together, cirumstantial evidence to put it all into perspective of what happened.<br>
The Mages had entered the castle by breaking the wards on the doors with the assistance of the Enchanters, Felwithe sending what it could to assist in the defeat of the beast who had slaughtered its folk. The magick around the castle was being held for a moment of time, suspended and the being known as Lord Mistmoore caught in bonds of magick, but not for long.<br>
Tallik moved first with three men, for there was nothing more to be done, and Daliea fell before she could cast something on them. Telerath was a bit faster, but Vreaa himself took the claim for his old ally’s death.<br>
But death could not erase the Training of Antonanth as Roderick lifted his sword. He was a General..Antonanth had been in line for the Guild Knight of Freeport. And was now undead.<br>
He cared little, only that for what the man had done, he must die again.<br>
The Mages held Lord Mistmoore tightly with magick, Enchanters racing into the room to set up their places quickly and there was little to be done but assist. Men raced around Lord Mistmoore, deadly red eyes glaring and the only matter on his being that could move. It took nearly fourteen men to move the table out of the way to give the Enchanters room to circle him with the Mages and their books.<br>
Lanadan also was clearing things, moving chairs and immese candleholders out of the way of Antonanth and his son, swords clashing as if there were no one else in the room but them. The elder’s sword had risen in Challenge first, and Roderick had felt no need to waste the moment replying with anything else but his own.<br>
Other men from the battalions outside were coming into the castle, and the undead themselves were coming up from the depths to assist their master. It was a nightmare of bodies too close together, people shouting and the original men in the dining hall keeping at least one doorway clear for the Mages and Enchanters to come through with their tools of binding.<br>
The chant soon took over the rage of battle, the few Knights who could spare a moment taking up the strange words and adding it to their own mental chant of battle as wave after wave of undead came up to the castle and fanned out from there down to the Knights past the ramp outside. The Mages were chanting, the Enchanters adding their magicks to the binding, and Lord Mistmoore was simply standing as he had been, rising from his chair, long taken from his area, and staring at them all with pure malice.<br>
The binding itself was rather simple, when Fithel spoke of it later, and he wondered why no one had previously thought to do such a simple attack. Lord Mistmoore was still flesh, and flesh could be slowed down, taken from one reality into another and held there. The problem was that no one would know, until he woke again, how long the bindings would keep him confined.<br>
Where to keep him confined, however, was never given a second thought, and Vreaa demanded that, once bound, Lord Mistmoore be sent to Felwithe so that none would forget, and no one would dare to ignore the reminder in the Mages Halls of what had happened to their blood.<br>
The binding was simple, childishly simple, and it was done in the middle of battle, and it was known that when it was done it was successful, for the undead simply stopped as they were, having no direction, for their contact with their lord was gone.<br>
There was nothing to do but clean up what was left...save for the battle in the dining hall.<br>
Roderick and Antonanth, years of hate and betrayal welling to the surface between the pair of them...Antonanth had been the only undead to not slouch down into a defeated posture once Lord Mayong Mistmoore had been bound. Blow after blow had come, on the attack then on the defense, using moves Roderick knew had been taught to him by this man a lifetime ago, and countering with motions he had learned from his own sire and his journeys abroad.<br>
There was no time to think of the faces staring at the pair of them, nothing to do but stare at the sword and think of defense, of attack that might end the matter.<br>
The Mages took the matter from him, binding Antonanth as they had Lord Mistmoore and Lanadan and Tallik pulling Roderick back before he swung again. “He’s held, son, leave it be. There’s other matters here we need to end.”<br>
Heaving, sweaty and exhausted from adrenaline rush, he looked to the first Mage beside him, who promptly backed up several feet in fear. “Find her,” was all he grated out.<br>
“You need the attention of a Healer...”<br>
“She IS a Healer..and we need to find her...”<br>
Tallik was staring at Antonanth’s blade, frowning. “Might be poison on it, Lord Lanadan, can’t be sure, but there’s something here...”<br>
“Take him out and let’s get her found.”<br>
Roderick felt the weariness suddenly pounding down on his body, not realizing the few Healers who had been brought at Gynath’s demand were pressing him to take a moment to himself and gather his own strength.<br>
Someone, probably Tallik, sat him in the nearest chair, and his armor was stripped off him, his tunic showing no wounds but a Healer pressing magick against his hands and he felt the wounds fighting the magick, and he pressed his own minor works back at them, banishing fatigue and calling on reserves of strength.<br>
Chathal was shouting something, coming into the fray again with something wrapped in a layer of cloth...no, not cloth, a larger gown that fit a slender figure, and Roderick stared at the figure.<br>
“Roderick, she’s nearly dead...he was trying to change her...”<br>
He stared at the sunken skin around her face, the skin no longer tanned and with a grayish tone that had not yet been welcomed fully. Her hair seemed brittle as he touched it, staring at the wounds on her throat, ripped open again and not even scabbed over. Had he been working on her while they were gathering near the ramp, he wondered?<br>
Someone pressed her into his arms and he rested his head against her own, looking up to Lanadan, to Tallik and Chathal and the others who had been in Freeport.<br>
“Take us back to Qeynos...the Healers will know what to do.”<br>
They started squabbling at him as if he were five again.<br>
“Roderick, better to take to Freeport for burial...”<br>
“She’s not going to survive...”<br>
“There’s nearly no blood left in her..”<br>
His voice had risen above theirs, as he had stood, gathering her in his arms and holding her tightly. She was barely breathing, he could feel a faint heartbeat, but would there be time?<br>
He looked to the Mages, to his sire, to the Enchanters and the men in the dining hall.<br>
“The Healers will know what to do,” he repeated, and Lanadan knew there was no changing his son’s mind. Hd had known him too long to not recognize that look...he himself wore it often when the moment demanded it.<br>
He sighed, wondering where it was all going to end.<br>
“To Qeynos, Roderick?”<br>
His son nodded over Lady Alamathea’s head against his shoulder. “To Qeynos, and the Healers Halls.”<br>
