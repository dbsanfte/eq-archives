Eighteen hours of siege would leave any man, or woman, in a realm between existence and the dream-like state of disbelief and ultimate exhaustion.<br>
Roderick's second mother was Illiysha, of an old, noble house in Qeynos and from a long, long line of Healers on her own mother's side. Lord Lanadan's marriage to her, after the death of his first wife, had been an Alliance that had turned into genuine affection after several years, and multiple children. After bearing him, at current count, twelve children, both living and dead,  and also being the Guild Lady from the day of her marriage to Lanadan, she was the most respected Healer still alive in Qeynos who shared universal respect from all the Guild Halls, no matter their race.<br>
Her trained eyes instantly saw blood on Roderick's hand, taking it and finding it from Lady Alamathea's bloodied palm and with a bluster of mock rebuke and the warmth only a gracious matron and Guild Lady could do, she all but swept the young woman out of the arms of the men in a bustle of ringing voice, soothing words and thick arms shrouded in loose fabric, and into the Guild Hall without another glance back to her husband, her son, her daughters or the men. They all knew, later, there would be welcomes for them all. She was not one to slight anyone who came into her Guild Hall.<br>
To a one, the men thought Lady Alamathea's ultimate look of absolute blankness was enough to justify the cause of Roderick's bringing her with them.<br>
The amusement on Lord Lanadan's face brought a hesitant one to the young men flanking Tallik and Roderick. &quot;She'll have her all dressed in lace fore she knows what's happening to her, just as she does the little ones.&quot; He was patting the head of one of his many daughters, dark of hair and eyes as he was, but tall and all growing into their inches quickly...or so Illiysha was often remarking when helping them dress themselves each morning.<br>
Tallik, noting Lanadan's eyes behind his son's head, caught the elder's eyes, both sharing a moment's smile of knowing. Roderick, himself, was patient with his sisters, giving each one a caress on their hair and face, but his eyes were focused on the retreating figures of his mother and Lady Alamathea.<br>
&quot;Come now, into the halls, as we have matters to discuss.&quot;<br>
&quot;Ship Ahoy!&quot;<br>
They had looked up as one, to the guard tower just at the gates of the city. There was a considerable distance between the gates and the docks, or what remained of them now, and Lanadan looked up to the watch.<br>
They were running, they began to run as one, Lanadan and Roderick moving quickly into the city as the guards began sealing the gates behind them in a flurry of motion and words. The eldest of the girls was already scrambling towards the Guild Hall. Tallik knew the city middling well, the three young men trailing behind him pressing closer so as not to get lost in the growing shuffle of bodies and the stream upon stream of steel and chain flowing into the streets towards the water.<br>
Roderick took the initiative, loping up the nearest rampway to the guard's walk that circled the city, men startled at the sight of he and his father, Tallik and others behind them, heading towards the docks and caught between saluting reverence and the need to know what they must do next.<br>
Roderick, Lanadan...Tallik, Fethar...all the others, gathered on the rampway and looked at the ruins of the docks, and the nine ships coming closer to the city. The far-sighted lookout would be well worth his eyes this day, but nine ships...each could hold nearly three hundred, or more, given that Teir`Dal were shorter, less made than normal men.<br>
Lanadan had not lied when he said the docks had been destroyed to keep the boats from having an easy time landing in Qeynos Harbor, but by setting the docks free of their lashings, as well as burning many, they were also confined to the fact that no trade could enter the city by anywhere but overland...a fact that, perhaps, was something to be weary of.<br>
Roderick was weary, but there was duty, and he rubbed his eyes and looked at the boats, to his sire and to Tallik. He wanted to sleep, to lay down and recover from everything that had happened the last few days and knew it would, once again, be denied him.<br>
Cannon fire and they all began to sweat. Casualties would be running high if they shot them into the city, without knowing where they would land. Lanadan caught the nearest man, sending him to evacuate the city towards the far gates, towards the hills and, if necessary, open the gates to evacuate the city so that the people would have their lives if nothing more.<br>
They all stared as one out into the waters of the harbor, to the ships, to the waiting battle. And still...there were no answers, even when it was over.<br>
<br>
<br>
----------------------<br>
<br>
The hills around qeynos were littered with refugees, but they were alive. Lanadan himself had gone out with Roderick to see to their welfare as best they could. As usual, to no one's surprise, Illiysha had been there long before they had considered coming to see those who were camping in the hills outside the city.<br>
She had gathered as many as she could to distribute tents, foodstuffs, blankets for those who had not had time to bring such necessities. Of those who needed special care...babies, the elderly, those already ill before the attack, they were gathered just outside the city gates to be tended to first.<br>
This had not been her doing, however...it had been the doings of Lady Alamathea, completely out of her realm in another city, younger than Lady Illiysha's first daughter born to Lanadan, and a healer none knew.<br>
In eighteen hours since the seige had begun, and in the two since the last ship had been sunk and those remaining elves had been vanquished, Illiysha had come to one conclusion.<br>
Qeynos was hers...oh, the Lord of Qeynos was a just man, but the Guild Hall was its soul, the symbol of good and justice and right that all turned to in times of need and desperation. The Guild Halls were her domain and she was loved, respected, she was mother to over seven thousand men and women in various parts of the world, all connected by being from Qeynos and, at at least one point of their lives in Service, were beneath her wing...whether it be at birth or at death.<br>
But they were quickly coming to care for another...a motion that made her smile to herself, and she was laughing when it should have been bringing irritation to her.<br>
The General's Woman, she had heard on more than one occasion from people she knew.<br>
Not a jealous woman to begin with, knowing her limitations of beauty and duty and action, Illiysha walked from camp to camp, listening to the tales of the beautiful young woman who had somehow found more supplies, had soothed the children and gave them toys to play with, stories to calm them. There had been a group of nearly fourty children enrapt during the greatest of the shellings, all listening to her voice.<br>
If Illiysha was the Guild Lady...after the Seige of Qeynos, Lady Alamathea had become its soul.<br>
There was not a wounded man who she had not at least given some magick to, and that concerned Illiysha more. A Healer's greatest gift from Those They Served was their magick, their ability to heal, to cleanse, to soothe wounds and illness. But all things came with great study, and great price if one was not careful.<br>
Four hundred men out of three thousand had been injured...some had been her own sons from the Guild Hall, others had been from the city itself. A fair number, considering the damage to the city's waterfront quarters, but in hindsight, having the ability to run to the hills with the city's folk had saved many lives.<br>
And none of them, to a man, had been seen by any other Healer first than the still unaccounted for Lady Alamathea of Freeport.<br>
Illiysha had believed her resting at first, as the Healers were doing on blankets just inside the city's gates, where they could easily be woken if another seige came and sent into the camps to move the people again. But no one could remember seeing her lying down at all...few could remember seeing her in one spot at any given time, moving from person to person. Several recalled seeing her holding children, moving men from one area to another dependant on their wounds and, in the worst cases, seeing to the Releasing of the Soul for those who had not survived.<br>
But the majority of those requiring Releasing of the Soul were inside the city...and Lanadan had ordered none of them, due to the random shots from the boats, be given that Rite until after the seige. He did not need Healers dying even to do their duties.<br>
Upon not finding her anywhere within the acres of refugees...there was no other place to look but within the city...and doing so meant she sought out her husband, who was in the middle of assessing the damage himself.<br>
Lanadan was exhausted, bloody from a wound to his head that someone had bandaged as best they could, and Roderick was little better for exhaustion, though unwounded.<br>
Tallik had broken a leg, and one of the three young men had taken a piece of falling debris against his head and was sleeping off the stun of the event outside the gates.<br>
She caught Lanadan's eyes over the map, the candles and the lanterns blazing as the ring of men came to attention at the sight of her.<br>
Her fingers wiggled, head shaking and she looked at them. &quot;No courtesies this night, my sons...I need to find one of our own now.&quot;<br>
Lanadan looked up with concern, on his feet as the chair scraped on the bare stones in what had, earlier, been a quiet street leading to the docks. &quot;The children...&quot;<br>
&quot;They're alright, Lanadan...they're sleeping off most of the exhultation of seeing their first battle under Tressa's eyes in the nursery.&quot;<br>
&quot;Then who...&quot;<br>
&quot;Where is she?&quot;<br>
She winced at Roderick's tone, and instantly Lanadan, and the two remaining men in Roderick's service, knew who was missing.<br>
It took all her willpower to try to not laugh...but she did smile at him. &quot;The General's Woman is missing.&quot;<br>
&quot;Where is she, Mother?&quot;<br>
Her look turned to one of concern now, no longer laughing at the matter, despite Lanadan's look of surprise to wife and son. &quot;No one has seen her in quite some time...she has seen to all the wounded...&quot;<br>
&quot;ALL?&quot;<br>
A curt nod to her husband, to her son with a more concerned look. &quot;Everyone's seen her at some point, and she's assisted in my duties when I had other matters to attend to in the Guild Hall...and I wish to thank her for taking them up when I didn't have the time.&quot;<br>
Roderick was groaning, rubbing his eyes again and shaking his head, chuckling to himself. &quot;Mother, did you show her where the healing rooms were?&quot;<br>
&quot;I did just before the seige came to fruition...I had to show her where the herbs were...&quot;<br>
He nodded, waving she and his sire off and giving a laugh. &quot;I'll bring her back, you stay here. She's probably doing the same thing she used to do in Freeport when she exhausted herself.&quot;<br>
&quot;Exhausted herself? Oh, Roderick, that's terribly wrong of her to do so. She's too young to be pushing herself.&quot;<br>
Now he was amused, and rightly so, for even Lanadan was grinning. Illiysha was a mother hen, and rightfully so to them all. They were her sons, her daughters, all her adoptive children.<br>
&quot;She's more powerful than you may imagine, Mother...if anyone would take the time to test her, perhaps, they might see what the rest of us have known for quite some time.&quot;<br>
He waved off Lanadan's offer to send two men, and Illiysha's concerned words. &quot;I'll bring her back, you'll see.&quot;<br>
The Guild Hall, being first and foremost what a traveller saw when entering the city's gates, to the left side, had been, for the most part, untouched simply by the distance from the water. Roderick knew every tunnel, every little crack in the walls of old...and knowing it did not make the job he knew was coming any easier.<br>
The healing rooms were where the most critically injured were brought, as well as the storerooms for the herbs and few potions to do so.<br>
One of the first times he had seen her, a lifetime ago with her hair babyfine still and toddling between the legs of the tables...her sire had come to Qeynos for some reason, bringing his wife with him and their latest child. Who had gotten herself lost in the great room of herbs and tables and healing elements and had promptly fallen asleep as if it were her personal bedroom.<br>
The Guild had often found her sleeping there over the years, simply exhausted and finding herself drawn to the smell of herbs. It was a joke of sorts that if she was ever missing, all one had to do was open the door and find her.<br>
In the predawn hours of Qeynos, he found his way with a torch through the abandoned walk of the Guild Hall, and the door, as he had known it would be, was ajar.<br>
The young woman struggling to save a life, however, was not what he expected to be doing.<br>
Nor was the Teir`Dal on the table, resisting the magick she was healing him with, putting up a protest to the action.<br>
His reaction of bringing his sword out and tossing her aside into another table was instantaneous. They had thought them all dead, even the Necromancers had come out to assist with the city's defense, for if it fell, they would fall sooner or later to the same scourge.<br>
&quot;NO!&quot;<br>
The voice was raw, more a hoarse shriek than a cry and she hit him with all the force of her body, knocking him aside and sprawling on the floor, torch and sword going either direction and the pair of them stunned for a moment and then staring at one another.<br>
&quot;He's wounded...he took a knife to the shoulder...&quot;<br>
&quot;Pity it missed his heart...&quot;<br>
&quot;...I didn't know where to put it where he wouldn't be killed.&quot;<br>
Roderick gripped her shoulder, feeling her wince at the bruises beneath it and staring at her. &quot;What did you say?&quot;<br>
&quot;I was trying to give Release of the Soul to the people in the city...and I found him. And I couldn't leave him in the city because he was wounded, so I brought him here...&quot;<br>
&quot;You brought him from the docks...&quot;<br>
&quot;I dragged him...his legs were broken...&quot;<br>
&quot;You DRAGGED him here?!&quot;<br>
She stopped, lips pursing and staring at him. Her eyes were haunted again, as they had been in Felwithe, and he feared what she had seen, coming into the city at the end of the seige and the cleanup near the docks.<br>
She'd not been wearing her armor...between the Charges in Freeport and their arrival here in Qeynos, she had come in nothing more than a simple gown that had been too large for her but belted and tucked in the shoulders as best someone could do. It was stained darkly now in places, with what he didn't wish to know but knew anyway.<br>
She had dragged this man over the city's cobbles...to the Guild Hall...and Healed him.<br>
She had brought a Teir`Dal into the city's Guild Halls because he was wounded....while Roderick and his men had been ridding the city of the others.<br>
&quot;He's hurt...I know you don't understand because you were up above and they were attacking...but he's hurt...I couldn't leave him there...&quot;<br>
&quot;Why DIDN'T you?! Do you realize what you've done? The WHOLE Guild will have to be cleansed now!&quot;<br>
&quot;Why? Because I brought someone here to Heal them because I couldn't do it out there? Or because of the color of his skin? Because he happened to get wounded and someone, maybe you, would've gutted him before he could maybe tell us what's happening?&quot;<br>
She pushed his sword at him across the tiles, kicking it with her foot, and he noted her shoes were missing. There was no telling what she'd stepped in...or that he truly wished to know.<br>
&quot;Do it! He's half-Healed now...his legs will be by the first light and he can't move his left shoulder because I immobilized it. Kill him as you did the others.&quot;<br>
She gripped his hand then, pushing his sword into it and tightening the fingers, all but hauling him up somehow despite her waning strength from everything in Freeport and pushed him towards the table. Laid out, bare from the waist and legs and one arm immobilized, he was nothing more than a boy staring up with frightened eyes.<br>
She was staring at him, her breathing louder than his own heart racing.<br>
He was just that....on the table, a boy...older than his years with one moment's actions in time, his sunlight-deprived eyes staring at Roderick over the torch and candlelight. Roderick himself had, one time, been also &quot;just a boy&quot; before his first battle, before his own battalion leader had been killed that same day by stupidity on his own part and shown them all that thinking did not always keep one alive.<br>
But that day had taught him that, despite every decision, every thought and move...if it felt wrong, do something to right it.<br>
The boy staring up at him was nothing more than that...a boy.<br>
His fingers unclenched, the sword clattering to the tiles and he heard Alamathea's audible sigh behind him, and watched her fall to her knees at his feet.<br>
Her head was nearly on the floor, her fingers touching his foot, and he crouched down, trying to get her back up. He saw she was crying again.<br>
He took off his gloves, brushing her bloodstained face free of the tears and shook his head at her. &quot;Has he spoken to you at all?&quot;<br>
She nodded, exhaustion nibbling at her eyes, her fingers uncannily restless in his own now, and he gathered her against him. &quot;Do you know what he's said?&quot;<br>
Another nod, this one slower, more a jerk than a nod, and she looked up to him.<br>
&quot;Please...you can't kill him...he's alive too...&quot;<br>
His fingers pushed her hair back, laying a kiss against her hairline. &quot;And he'll continue to live if you don't put too much of yourself into him and die so that he doesn't.&quot;<br>
A hint of a smile from her and he lifted her up to her feet.<br>
&quot;I need to make him sleep...&quot;<br>
&quot;And then yourself...you'll be no help tomorrow if you're half dead also.&quot;<br>
She nodded, and he knew she was ignoring him, but her fingers were without fear as she took the boy's dark hand in hers, the magick flaring with a gentle, soothing noise and motion around him, and his night-attuned eyes closed. She checked the splints on his legs, the bandages holding his arm in place and looked up at Roderick.<br>
Her hair was stained for the most part a deep russet from blood and falling in ragged clumps down her back. The gown she had been in was stained also, several rips having been covered by her discovery of a smock in the healing rooms she had put over it to keep some form of modesty. She was swaying with exhaustion, and his arm steadied her, leading her from the healing tables to the smaller room with the herbs off of the main one.<br>
He felt her taking as deep a breath as her tired lungs would allow her, and she gave a silly smile in his direction. He was not surprised to see, already in one corner near the majority of the herb bundles, a nest of blankets and a stained pillow all ready for her.<br>
Roderick led her to it, all but pushing her down and a finger wagging in front of her face. &quot;You get some sleep. I promised Mother I'd return with you, but I can't bring you back with me in this state or she'll think I did something to you.&quot;<br>
&quot;But you haven't done anything to me yet.&quot;<br>
He stared at her...Lady and Healer and young woman that she was, and he wondered how long he had been avoiding what everyone else seemed to be saying.<br>
&quot;What's wrong?&quot;<br>
He gave a half-laugh, turning the wick of the lantern lower and beginning to chuckle as he squeezed her hand.<br>
&quot;I believe everything is going to be just fine now.&quot;<br>
&quot;How do you know this?&quot;<br>
A hand brushed her hair back again, another kiss against her hairline and she was blushing. &quot;Because the General's Woman is just that...and Lord Antonanth can raze the city to get you if he chooses. You're staying here, with me...because I want you to...and other reasons.&quot;<br>
&quot;What other reasons? You're saying I can stay here with you? You want me to stay?&quot;<br>
&quot;You're going to have to stay when Mother finds us after we've slept.&quot;<br>
&quot;Why?&quot;<br>
He only chuckled at her.<br>
