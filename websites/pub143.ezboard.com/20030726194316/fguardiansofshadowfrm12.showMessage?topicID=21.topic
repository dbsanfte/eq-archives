<br>
The noises outside her cell were unusual, but, then again, so many people had come and gone so recently, she had no idea of what this set might want that the last had forgotten somehow.<br>
The guards had known about her presence, but had done nothing until she had Called the pet, at that point having no choice but to bring out force and take her to the city out of fear and danger to their fellow men, or so they said. She was stripped of the cloak and what little clothing she had, put into a cell with chains and endless, upon endless hours questioning, voices demanding she tell them what had happened, how she had been part of the destruction, how she might have prevented it. On and on and on, there was nothing left but words after a while, and the cold stone behind her head to rest upon between interrogation and half-sleep.<br>
There was little food, more water than food if anyone had bothered to look. The chains were wearing on her dark skin, bringing layer after layer to chafe and finally bleeding lightly, despite her trying to hide that fact when they came to demand answers of her.<br>
The light...she needed no light to begin with, her red eyes easily seeing into the darkness, but the light from outside the cell bothered her. Perhaps it was put there to annoy her, perhaps give her some reason to confess something that she had no part in.<br>
The rumors she was hearing from those who came to speak to her...they frightened her. They told her the army that had left had done something horribly evil, something that even frightened her, and that a city had been destroyed.<br>
Sadly, not this one...much to her fate.<br>
Fear of another attack, it seemed, was bringing out the fear of her skin, of her very being, and people were often dumping things into the barred window of the cell, thankfully away from her, but unpleasant things all the same.<br>
She simply wanted to sleep, wanted the luxury of simply closing her eyes for ten minutes and perhaps waking up to the fact that she was back in her own tiny room, her siblings teasing her about the fact that her healings turned into poisonings. Though, given the intrigue of her land, poisonings were common, as were deaths, and only the strong survived.<br>
The voices were outside the cell still, and she, bent over with her head against her knees, for the chains gave that as her best possible comfortable position against the wall and the floor...the voices were not going away. She lifted her head, matted hair falling over one eye and wondered what they wanted this time. It was high night and she was tired, so tired. The last gathering had left only a while before and had come to the same conclusions as the previous one, and all those before.<br>
She either knew something so terrible she would be put to death to hide its secret...or she simply knew nothing of what had happened in Felwithe's burning.<br>
Either way...she was a Teir`Dal in a strange city, caught in a cell with a mania against her people rising with each passing hour.<br>
Perhaps death might not be so bad after all..better it than to remain here half alive for their amusement.<br>
She heard no keys, but movement caught her attention at the click of the lock on the door, and she watched it swing open slowly.<br>
Two figures,  one robed and rather tall, then again, everyone was tall to her...despite her stating that she was of average height in her Blood. One much, much older than the other, parchment-smooth skin along his face and his hands, the black robes about him making no sound and bringing up no dust as he took several steps into the cell.<br>
She was weary of him, this man with his hair as white as hers, with the glowing sigils along the hem of his robes and the staff in his hand and the single, glowing something against his neck that glowed despite the heavy robes.<br>
He looked to his younger companion, nodding to the other who was in heavy armor with a hand on his sword and constantly looking out the door for someone.<br>
The elder's hands reached out to her, and she was suddenly afraid, drawing back her raw wrists and ankles and her whole being into a tight ball against the stones, eyes weary of the hands extended to her.<br>
&quot;Child, they didn't even give you the ability to keep yourself clean and healthy?&quot;<br>
It was not what she expected, having tightened her throat to attempt to speak the Common tongue once again, despite the clicks and noises hurting her throat as she spoke them. They made such a horrible noise.<br>
But...this human...he was not speaking of the city...he was speaking to her in fluent Teir`Dal...it took her a moment to give him a startled look and raise her head again, to which he gave a chuckle in the darkness.<br>
&quot;Yes, child, I know your language, and you have a choice now. And a rather quick one...remain or follow. That is all I can state now, because both lead to something only you can decide.&quot;<br>
Decide to remain?<br>
Decide to follow?<br>
Was he serious? And was that a choice?<br>
He was fingering the chains on her wrists, eyes staring at the wounds and then at her ankles, though she had thought them hidden. His eyes seemed to see right through her, through the stones behind her and beyond anything of life.<br>
This was a choice?<br>
She held up her wrists to him, not displaying them so much as trying to move uneasily without the full use of her hands and arms. The motion, however, to him, was extending them for freedom.<br>
Hence, he did so, fingers suddenly glowing with a deep, old glow and the chains melting from her wrists as if never there, melting with a fire that did not burn, but left them a pile of dark steel on the floor of the cell.<br>
She could not stop her gasp of surprise, and his courteous eyes motioned her to stand, now that she could grip something. His hand was offered, and she was startled at the grip of it...stronger than perhaps even that of her cousins, fighters one and all, and often times having chased her with things to tease her.<br>
The grip brought her up, unsteadily, for she had been curled tightly for many days, and he motioned for her to put her hands on his shoulders as he freed her legs. He did not care about her filthiness, about her stink or about her skin, she noted, only that when the chains on her ankles were free, he gripped her hand in that smooth, strong hand again and motioned her to the door.<br>
&quot;Can you walk, or shall we assist you?&quot;<br>
Her shuffled steps were more than mute observance there was little blood in them to carry her far, and the man in armor was scowling by the door. &quot;She'll not be able to keep up if someone finds us soon. Take her down through the hallway.&quot;<br>
To her horror, he lifted her from the elder man's grip, carrying her from the cell and into the darkness of the hallway.<br>
Ultimate darkness it seemed...what was happening? The way leading to her cell was never this dark, never at all, and somehow she had a moment to glance back, and the window was black also. The lands of her birth seemed nigh once again.<br>
She was carried to the end of the walkway, the older of the pair whispering something and the wall behind her melting as if it were water, whisper-soft the words were and she was carried through, feeling the tingle of magick, OLD magick for it was, and then not given a moment to stare as the elder closed the gate behind them. She was being taken down into darkness again.<br>
And darkness claimed her, finally, and she slept before ever reaching their goal with her eyes open.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Firatha woke to a strange bed, a strange room, strange smells and sounds and, for a wild moment, wondering why  her Sire had not woken her, or her Matriarch, for the first break of the day with her siblings.<br>
As still as she could be, her eyes took in her surroundings, of the bed that she was now on, quite comfortable despite it being suited for four people and not just her small self. And there were strange, stuffed things that her head wasy laying on. She gave one an exploratory poke, finding it full, from the smell, of feathers, and grinning. Feather-stuffed linens...very interesting.<br>
The sheets were rather heavy also, as if it grew cold wherever she was now, and she pushed them back with a dull ache in her hand. She discovered, upon inspection, she had been bathed until the last of everything was off her, and her hair was long-dry now. Her wrists and ankles had been bound in light cloth, as she had seen her siblings and others do for years and years. And whomever had done it had not had the light touch of an amateur, afraid of burning themselves for touching her skin, or perhaps diseased for her assistance to another life.<br>
She giggled, despite being alone in the strange room, and sat up slowly, looking around with delight.<br>
Somehow, her second abduction had turned into a rescue, though she had no idea of where she was. The room smelled faintly of the city above, though there was a heavier, more weighty smell now. Herbs and old magicks and the smell of food kept the air steadily churning here.<br>
Other than the wide bed, there were bookcases, nearly five of them in the grand room, and she moved off the bed, delighted again, to find she was in a rather weighty, lovely gown that someone had found in nearly her size. She fingered it and found the weave a tight one; a good quality, and not one easily found outside the weavers quarters of her own city. They hoarded such things for display of wealth.<br>
Uneasy steps, for her legs were still weary from inactivity, she brought herself to the first bookcase, staring at it and barely coming up to the third shelf. It was a rather impressive display, and she was reminded of the ones in her own city, often stained with blood by those in triumph for being the first to do so when a new one was unearthed for display.<br>
None of these were bloodstained, all were bound in leather and magicks, for they sang to her. She could hear them, a gentle noise, not unpleasant, against her ears...no, not against her ears, against her whole being.<br>
They were in many languages, and she knew languages well, having had to study them, as all Teir`Dal did, to know exactly what one's foe was saying. She ran her fingers experimentally over some of the bindings, watching with fascination that the sigils and writings came to life as her fingers passed over them.<br>
It was strange to be looking at so many books, on just one shelf, and not a one of them that mentioned war. She noted this instantly. Though she noted some of them were dedicated to death, to diseases and poisons, to the study of life also and how it might be prolonged.<br>
So fascinated she was, she never heard the door open, nor the three who entered the room simply staring at her for a long moment.<br>
The book that caught her interest the most was, as always, two shelves above her, standing on her toes and barely touching it with a fingertip, it was a simple work, rather thick however, on those things that her Blood had not spoken of, but had feared she was. Necromancy, Darkness and Blood, Undead and Death...well, she had told them from the start that she had never fully felt whole doing the Healing spells.<br>
The book sang to her, and she wanted to look at it, and was so stretched that her ankles finally protested and she stood down, bending down to give them a rub. When she straightened herself again, she banged her head against a steel arm.<br>
The noise brought the elder man to her side again, rubbing her head and chuckling. &quot;Child, you are prone to accidents I see?&quot;<br>
A moment's horror at being found, the intense fear of suddenly being worse than the cell she had been freed from and staring at the armored man whose arm she had bumped into, to the elder man with his soft hand on her shoulder now and the other one who said nothing but his eyes were not unkind to her.<br>
The book she had been seeking was in the armored one's hands.<br>
&quot;Child, I apologize, but we must ask you, in all honesty, why you were wandering outside your lands at such a time of destruction?&quot;<br>
She only looked in confusion to the faces, to Teir`Dal flowing from the lips and giving a shrug at last. &quot;I don't understand what you're speaking of, what anyone's speaking of lately.&quot;<br>
&quot;How long have you been gone from your lands, Child?&quot;<br>
&quot;How many human days was I in that cell?&quot;<br>
&quot;Five, Child, five before we were told of your existence. My sincere apologies we did not take you sooner.&quot;<br>
Five days...she had been gone quite a long time from her lands.<br>
She estimated, and told them without too much information that she had stolen away with an army, to escape at last, it was hoped anyway, and that she had watched them vanish and been alone.<br>
The elder man was only stroking her shoulder gently, encouraging her to speak her own words and only asking gentle questions when something needed to be answered.<br>
They asked her little, only about the army, and she held up a bandaged hand and wrist to them, three male faces looking at her. &quot;What has happened? No one will tell me...and where am I now?&quot;<br>
They told her of Felwithe's burning, that a darkness greater than themselves had been brought down on the elven city. That the army that had vanished from her lands had appeared in the middle of the elven heart of Faydwer and had levelled everything in sight and then burned the forests.<br>
She had never seen Felwithe, had never seen Faydwer, but could only nod. She had seen the army's departure, had seen the numbers and had known they were taking up arms for a cause she had not known at the time, but knew great glory was awaiting them.<br>
&quot;You see now, Child, why we were asking. We are trying to put together the events and what happened.&quot;<br>
She nodded, but having little information herself, and the others not having believed her, it was welcome to suddenly have the subject revealed, and dropped into silence just as easily.<br>
&quot;As to where you are, Child, your magicks Called us up to find you. It's rather rare we get to speak to one of your people about a common trade.&quot;<br>
Her eyes were blank and stared at him, and they stared back at her in equal curiosity. &quot;Child, you are of Darkness, are you not?&quot;<br>
She pointed to her skin, nodding, and the elder man grinned, waving it away. &quot;No, Child, your magick, your soul that delights as you live and breathe...the magicks of Necromancy. We were curious if you might speak to us what you do in your lands.&quot;<br>
They wanted to know what?<br>
She looked from the scarred face of the man in armor, to the two robed ones and started to giggle, a giggle that broke into a full-fledged, near-hysterical roaring laugh after a moment, that, in turn, went to tears at somehow finally being free of the cell.<br>
The men said nothing derrogatory, and the elder man only took a seat on the bed and stroked her hair gently as she whispered about beatings and freedom and her vanished pet.<br>
&quot;Child, how long have you known what you were?&quot;<br>
&quot;For as long as I've been alive, I fear.&quot;<br>
&quot;And how long have you been able to BE what you are?&quot;<br>
A strange question, but a simple answer.<br>
&quot;Since leaving my lands approximately a moon ago.&quot;<br>
The elder was looking to the others, his voice gentle but obviously concerned. &quot;A wild talent without Training...and Teir`Dal? Is this possible?&quot;<br>
&quot;She must go back to where she came from.&quot;<br>
&quot;Which is where? It's not as if we can go back to where we all came from originally.&quot;<br>
It was a light bickering, her eyes going from one face to another, studying them all. The elder who sat with her on the bed was, indeed, aged and very courteous. He had the scent of old magick and herbs about him the strongest.<br>
The mostly silent one, probably the same age but with a pinched face that made her giggle inside when he spoke, for it made him look as if he were crossing his eyes constantly, he was also in black robes, though the sigils on his were of a deeper gray, if that were possible, and he smelled of leather and of ink and binding fluids. The books, she noted, were probably his sole joy of life.<br>
The one in the armor, however, with a scar running down the side of one cheek to his throat, was younger than the others by many years, and if she sniffed hard enough, there was a Blood resemblance between the man in armor and the elder beside her. His armor tingled when she brushed against it, full of magicks of its own, and she was curious what he was doing here with the robed ones. His sword looked well-used, as did the armor, and the thought that he was one akin to those of her cousins brought more curiosity to her.<br>
The elder stroking her shoulder, however, ended the discussion. &quot;We cannot turn out one of our own, no matter who they be. We are not barbarians and easier to teach her here, in our world, than to send her to death above.&quot;<br>
She followed his finger, pointing to the ceiling, and suddenly realized why the smells were heavier down here.<br>
They were below the city, and she looked around the room once again with a new fascination.<br>
Beneath the city...she knew the rumors. There were often bouts of magick and blood between the young men and women of her city and of this one's sewer dwellers. She herself had had to attend to one of the rather larger groups returning from a failed attack.<br>
The Necromancers had found her...and they were saying she was one of theirs now.<br>
Well, somewhat truthful, as she had no where else to go now, and, indeed, she felt an obligation to them suddenly for saving her from the cell.<br>
But...what to do?<br>
She was suddenly curious about the book the one in the armor had put behind her on the bed, and she looked to it, hearing the laughter of the elder beside her, who took it up at last and set it in her hands. It was rather heavy, and she scooted back onto the bed to examine it.<br>
&quot;Child, you have no book of your own to study from, nor anything to know what you are. You are welcome to remain here, though I would advise some feeding and taking some hours to look over some of the other books on what we are.&quot;<br>
&quot;I may remain here?&quot;<br>
The gentle hand pushed back her clean hair, and she wondered if he himself had been the one to bathe her. There was a kindness about him that made her want to weep for some reason.<br>
&quot;You are welcome here for as long as we can hide you, Child. And from the sounds, you require the skills of your magick and your arts...and we can teach you, for an exchange.&quot;<br>
That brought about a look of fright, and the man in armor was the one with soothing voice now. &quot;We don't rape women, we're not that cold. We need to know more about your people, for the books. We only have three books that are probably far from truthful..it would help Arton's book collection if you did.&quot;<br>
Arton, the one with the pinched nose, was looking at her, not as frightful as he could be, however, he was still amusing to look at.<br>
&quot;You want to know...about me?&quot;<br>
&quot;About your people, what you do, how you live...any information would be helpful.&quot;<br>
&quot;So you can kill us for what they did in Felwithe?&quot;<br>
The words were out before she could stop them, and she sighed in horror, waiting for the lash and the stick to come down on her instantly.<br>
It was the armored one who, after a moment's look to the other two, spoke up. &quot;No...we're not going to march against you, though others may. We'd be slitting our own throats if we did that, because we don't have the numbers to attempt it on your own lands. And if we did...what would that do? Give your warriors more reason to take on another city? No, we need to know more about you, so we understand you.&quot;<br>
&quot;The books down here, Child, none but us may look at. The magicks that bind them know, from touch, if they can be opened or not.&quot;<br>
She looked down to the book in her lap, heavy and thick leather sealing it, shadowy things dancing around the title drawn out in heavy ink and tooled in.<br>
It was a look of permission, one granted from the elder by her side, and she fingered the edge of the book, to her delight watching it open with fascination and a puff of magick against her fingertips that tickled. She was smiling, not realizing she was smiling until the hand on her shoulder rubbed it again.<br>
&quot;Welcome to Darkness, Child. If you can possibly tell us about your lands...perhaps we can teach you something in return to keep yourself alive and from harm next time.&quot;<br>
Firatha was nodding, looking from one face to the other and receiving a nod in reply, but it was only later, hours later when she fell asleep from the drain in the cell, that they told her she was still clutching the book, a beginner's book of the craft, and even in sleep would not let it go.<br>
