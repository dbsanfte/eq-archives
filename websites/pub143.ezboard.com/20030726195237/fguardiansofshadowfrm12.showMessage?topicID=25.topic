<br>
Whether it had been by chance or simply by someone realizing that nothing short of a knife to her gut could have surprised their Mouse, Barak and Gretta’s eldest, Brisa, somehow came to Firatha’s room the following morning with a head full of good interest and her arms laden with pattern books.<br>
She was doubly horrified that Firatha had no idea of what the latest fashion styles were...nor, gasp, did she care in the slightest.<br>
Horror of horrors.<br>
Brisa was a lovely young woman with a pleasant blend of her parents features, having her mother’s deep gold hair and a much lighter skin tone than her father, as well as his his eyes and, much to her dismay, his nose and dimples. That she had come seeking Firatha’s opinion of matters was no more startling than if the pet standing quietly beside the bed had come to tap her on the shoulder and ask for a meal.<br>
But Gretta had mentioned that Brisa was curious about her...and Firatha did not want to speculate, due to lack of sleep and sanity, who had sent Brisa to her on that particular morning. But here she was, and laden with pattern books and drawings in ink of styles from the Outpost “the leader of all fashion sense”, Firatha was told, though it made little sense to her that such a place of untamed nature outside of the walls should be cautious to how others looked at their garments. Having no sense of clothing herself, as the robes she had been given were quite adequate enough, save for the two pair of leggins Chiral had recommended she wear on occasion just to get a feel for them.<br>
Brisa chattered away on Firatha’s bed, showing her how sleeves should lay and taking fabric samples against their darker skin and testing them and, for the first time she could ever recall, someone fussed over her hair. It had grown rather lengthy of late, having been something always hacked off on a weekly basis due to it fell in her eyes when trying to fight off her cousins. Here, in the quiet solitude with her books, she had been able to ignore it beneath the cowl of her robes, and she was rather startled when Brisa turned tail and began to plait it, chattering away behind her.<br>
She insisted on being taken to the nursery to see the young ones, startling Firatha in that one of the boys there was her brother, and her youngest sisters were there also. Smelling now as she had neglected to do since her arrival, for it was a survival technique in a sense, she smelled the Blood ties within their veins, as well as Chiral’s grateful welcome for assistance with Kerlin, who was, as always, fussing in Firatha’s absence.<br>
Brisa and Firatha wandered, talking about not much of anything, for it was a very one-sided conversation, but lacking in very little as Firatha asked direct questions and was answered in a rather same detailed reply that she knew could only come from Brisa’s sire. Teir`Dal could be clipped and rather rude in their manners, but a child with a question was given one opportunity to know the answer, as detailed as possible to explain the matter, and then never again were they to ask it.<br>
She gathered her formal robes and her veils and her gloves and Brisa took her up into the city with an excited, breathless question to Arton, who was deep in his rooms of books and, as the only one other than Chiral they could find with authority, Firatha was dismissed from her duties of the day and sent with Brisa. The smells, the sights...without Kerlin to keep her distracted now, Firatha demanded that the young woman at her side explain everything and all that was to be seen, touched and tasted.<br>
Clothing was not something she took much pride in, but Brisa insisted on taking her to a seamstress and seeing what colors suited her...not that there was much to be done about her skin. The woman had obviously dealt with Brisa before, for she saw no revulsion nor means to call up the Knights upon seeing Firatha’s dark skin and never blinked a moment when Brisa explained she needed something other than robes to wear.<br>
Measured for four new “outfits” and then bustled off to another shop of what Brisa moaned were musty old books, Firatha found herself insanely curious about the city that she had long been taught was evil and to be destroyed...if one could not simply just succeed in the attempt. There were many shops in the market...tailors and grocers and men with trinkets and women with silks and it was all a blur for a while.<br>
Brisa heard the mumbled complain that Firatha had missed the morning meal...she gasped in mock horror, and took her to the family restaurant near the waterfront. Where else? And Gretta, no surprise, was there already...overseeing the mid-day meal as well as long in preparation for the evening one. She gave her daughter a kiss against the forehead and Firatha one also and shooed them into a table with a rather large bowl of salad. Not having any inkling of watching her weight of the tendency of young women to want to be slender to themselves and the opposite sex, Firatha did not realize that the salad had been put there for Brisa’s demands, and not her own curiosity at having such a delightful treat within reach again. There were tiny peppers and strange, black things and red tomatoes and whirls of sliced onions and cheese shreds and oh was there anything more to life than this?<br>
The black things eluded her, until she looked over to another table briefly, between Brisa’s grins and her own growing laughter at the other’s tales, and she saw a child with them on their fingertips. Such a strange place for an object, but the child was picking them from the salad and placing them on their fingers, and then walking his fingers along the table for a while and then eating them. Well...ritual perhaps? Mystical reverence to some higher being? Brisa tried not to laugh too hard when Firatha asked about them, and was told they were olives, and they were for eating...not so much for play, but for eating.<br>
There was soup and bread and Firatha ate more than she had the day before with Arton and Gretta, ignorant to the fact that Brisa picked at her salad and was only on the first bowlful by the time she was on her third bowl of soup and heartily cleaning the bowl with another slice of warm bread. As with all Teir`Dal, food was consumed just as quickly as it was burned within for fast movement and survival, and with children of her own consuming as much as she prepared, Gretta was overjoyed to have someone eating...and eating...and eating.<br>
Untained by watching her weight as well as the everyday things that teenagers of the city bore on their shoulders, Firatha listened to Brisa speaking of her friends, of life as Barak’s daughter, of the boy that she fancied in the schoolroom and look at the beautiful one who just walked through the door?<br>
With a kiss against Gretta’s cheek from them both, they were loose on the streets again with a threat that if they did not return for the evening meal that Barak would come looking for them. Firatha thought that a reasonable request, though the horror of it to Brisa made her wonder why. Sires would question their children not coming back at a sensible hour, would they not? Brisa only rolled her eyes and shook her head at Firatha, saying that it would be BARAK who came to find them...such the horrors of embarrassment to have that done.<br>
It made no sense to Firatha, but she accepted it.<br>
Brisa took her through the market again, this time towards where the Lord dwelled and, as Firatha guessed, a rather much more wealthy area of the city. She kept her gloves up high and her veils up and the hood of her robe, not her formal ones this time, tightly on her head. She could have been a magician for all those she passed by knew, and she noted that even Brisa was being careful and had found a cloak of her own to wrap about her shoulders with long draping sleeves to hide some of her arms.<br>
She had her first glance at a tiger, held within a large pen and gazing out with wondrous, untamed eyes at the world around it. The regret in Brisa’s voice when she spoke of it, a future gift to the Lord from someone abroad, was more than Firatha could bear. Such a beautiful creature, penned and on display, when it should be a stalker, a slinker between shadows and she walked away from it, leaving Brisa behind until the other came to walk beside her again.<br>
It was a day she hardly remembered and could not forget at the same time, conversations lasting moments or half the day at times, scattered with girlish delight and the questions of youth and the whispers of laughter. It was with regret that they walked through the markets, watching some of the owners beginning to close them for the evening meal and Brisa and Firatha began winding their way back towards Gretta’s business.<br>
To no one’s surprise, Barak and Arton were already there, laughing over formal drinks over something and the Grand Master Knight’s eyes widening with pride as Brisa gave him a brief hug and he gave her a kiss to her forehead. Firatha was greeted no less warmly, a squeeze to her hand and the inquiry of how the day had been and had she not been absolutely bored to tears with his daughter? There was a playful wink from sire and a rolling of the eyes of the daughter and Firatha saw Arton take a rather knowing drink from his cup to avoid having to grin too widely at them both.<br>
Gretta had the family assembled in the private area she had had built many years earlier for dignitaries. Finding that they instead wanted the water view instead of the view of the city, which, in hindsight, made sense, she had turned this into the family dining area and had gathered them all for the meal.<br>
Delightful day....there was more salad!<br>
Barak and Gretta were on either end of the table, as Firatha saw this was just, being sire and matriarch of their Blood as well as on either end there was little that the children could hide from them. Brisa sat next to Firatha, explaining that this was normally not her seat, but that Arton was across in her own chair and guests were given preference without question. And Kerlin had all but leapt into Firatha’s arms upon seeing her again. Such a horrible, horrible life he led...being without her for a whole day! The suffering that he had endured.<br>
Brisa only giggled at that, and Firatha found herself grinning down at the child with her own delight.<br>
Gretta herself had the meal served by her own hands, experience having taught her that it was better to have the food in the room than bustling back and forth to the kitchens. Laid out on the table, as well as in covered bowls on a large table behind her, steaming with scent and heat, no one was going to go hungry. One of Brisa’s sisters commented that if anyone had gone away hungry, they had skipped dessert.<br>
Barak and Arton spoke things during the meal, Kerlin and Barak and Gretta’s only son exchanting comments over the salad and each of them showing off their olive-tipped fingers with great delight. Firatha had looked rather innocently for as long as she could, for that was not something Gretta permitted the children to do, but Kerlin found it delightful that he was allowed to eat something off his fingers. Brisa was grinning also and had no question as to whom had taught Kerlin the trick, but had no possible clue as to when Firatha had spoken it.<br>
The sausage that Barak loved, much to Arton’s jokes, was not on the menu this evening, however, a steaming roast laden with vegetables and a rather thick sauce in its place and Firatha took very small fork-fulls of it, finding no need for a knife to cut it with and making certain that Kerlin ate what was on his plate before taking another handful of olives from atop her salad. Brisa, again, ate little, but Gretta was with family and made no secret of her demands that the young woman eat or she was going to be as thin as one of Arton’s pets one day. Barak’s inquiry to Firatha as to had his daughter eaten was met with a moment’s silence, for they had only had the one meal, despite the many wonderful choices in the market. But as they had eaten there for the mid-day meal, Barak was satisfied and nodded, and Firatha sensed there had been lies before, and said nothing more on it.<br>
Dessert was delight to both palate and to the cleaning women who would be working overtime to get the children’s clothing cleaned. Gretta had made something she claimed Arton would never pass up, something called a turnover, and Firatha stared at the large platter for several minutes, steaming as Gretta uncovered it to the delight of her family. There was nothing to be turned over, and her eyes nearly crossed until Arton laughed at her across the table and demanded to know what she was doing.<br>
The name of the pastry was eluding her as to its significance, though two were put on her plate, and one sliced in half for each of the boys. She assisted Kerlin with his own, cutting it in very small chunks and finding that the pastry itself was a rich blend of spiced dough on the outside and a rather thick mash of berries in their own sauces within.<br>
Gretta herself shook her head at Firatha, stating that they would get themselves stained and could be thrown into a tub later to be cleaned, and would she eat her own now? They were getting cold on her plate.<br>
She had wanted to nibble on one, nibbling, sadly, on the end where the dough had not been sealed securely and finding her chin, mouth, fingers and her robes coated with berries as the filling came out the other end. There was a moment’s terrified silence, to which Arton tried his hardest not to laugh, but there was nothing he could do to stop himself. Having been the one seated across from her, he could only laugh at what had happened. Gretta was grinning herself and took several napkins to Firatha’s robes and her fingers as she would one of her children, clucking over Firatha and then pushing her out of the room into the small privy and taking down several items for her to change into. They nearly fit her, and her robes were pushed down a chute to the cleaning women below.<br>
Returned in an old tunic and a very comfortable, worn pair of leggins, Firatha stared at the remains of the first turnover on her plate and gave a resigned sigh. Arton’s grinning comment that if she did not eat it, Kerlin certainly would, brought her eyes to the fact that in the time Gretta had been helping her change, Arton’s son had been drawing designs on Firatha’s plate with the glop of berries. And Kerlin was now heavily stained with the stuff...hair, fingers, clothing and even his nose somehow.<br>
But she finished them both eventually...Gretta pushing a third one on her as the first had not been sealed properly, or so she claimed. Whatever the reason, there were three that Firatha got to enjoy and did so with slow dignity.<br>
Kerlin and the younger children were shuffled off by Gretta when the meal was, for the most part, finished, saying they needed to be seen to a bath and Brisa and the next eldest daughter going to assist with the matter, for Gretta’s voice made it sound as if it would be a rather dreadful experience for them all. Firatha was given a small bowl of salad to keep her occupied, the look of gratitude not lost on the older woman who laid a kiss against her hair and patted her head, saying she wished her eldest daughter ate as well.<br>
Left with Arton and Barak, Firatha nibbled the last of the turnovers and then moved, again, to the salad bowl, shocked when Barak asked if she wished an after dinner drink with he and his brother-in-law.<br>
Drink?<br>
She looked at her glass, then to the smaller, more stout bottles that Arton and Barak had been slowly draining through the meal, and now the amber liquid that caught the candlelight and reflected a warm glow. It was brandy, she was told, and from Qeynos, a gift from Waylar and Pequil, who would be formally dining with them on the morrow. Gretta, Barak claimed, had been horrified to learn that her in-laws were both in the city and she had not been told and where were the funds to buy more food to properly greet them with a meal and there was nothing for the children to wear!<br>
Barak’s tone was as dour as Arton’s, but they were both grinning at that, and it made no sense to Firatha that if Gretta was worried about concocting a meal for Waylar and Pequil, why spare expense?<br>
But the question remained, and she did not know how to reply. Chiral and Drathyl, she knew, had enfolded her in the Naming of their son several days after his birth, and everyone there, as well as in the tunnels, had been given a bottle of wine in celebration. Though those who had come to see the Naming had been given a taste of the drink beforehand, and Firatha, not having known what it was, had declined, to which her hostess Chiral had understood without batting an eye of irritation.<br>
But she was much more wise to the tunnels now, as well as her curiosity from the day was rather high. Arton passed her his glass, taking another offered one from Barak, who held his high for a moment. “To health, to happiness, and to the heart that knows too dammed well better than anything else what to do.”<br>
Arton seconded the toast, and Firatha looked to them strangely. “Customary after the meal...though we’ll have another when Gretta returns. We toast one another’s happiness over the years, Firatha.”<br>
“Why?”<br>
Barak looked to Arton, who gave a rather equally frustrated look in return. “Toasting with alcohol, or whatever drink, is a human custom. Something people do at formal gatherings, weddings and births and deaths also. I don’t know where the custom started, but it’s a rather common one. Gretta explained it as something humans do to make people remember why they’re gathered, and things that should be remembered if they aren’t.”<br>
Things to be remembered, then, and she nodded after a moment to this. Remembering was important to humans, who had such a short span of life compared to other races. The glass in her fingers held a new significance now as she stared at it and then to Arton and to Barak, both looking at her.<br>
So they toasted one another...Barak, as always, to his wife and his children...the children who drove him to distraction and the wife who complained that he could never keep his socks clean. There was some private joke that Firatha, and it appeared Arton, were not privy to, but there was a grin on Arton’s face as he had heard this before.<br>
From the Recordkeeper came the toast to his dead wife, a moment’s sadness that she was gone and would not see Kerlin growing as, perhaps, she might have wished him to do. Arton spoke briefly of his parents, and the gift of new allies. Firatha noted a strange look on both Barak and Arton’s faces as he spoke, not certain what it meant but that they were both staring at her.<br>
She realized they were waiting on her, now, to say something, and the glass suddenly felt granite heavy as she slid it towards her. What did one say? This was a human formality, and she did not wish to ruin it by saying something silly.<br>
She got her fingers steady around the glass at last, looking to Barak and then to Arton and taking a moment to decide. “To the people who freed me from the cell and gave me my robes because I like them.”<br>
Simple enough, and Barak and Arton found no fault at that, and drank down their share of the brandy. Having consumed quite a healthy portion of the meal herself, as Barak and his children did, as all Teir`Dal did, she watched them for a moment and, as they did, drank the glass down and had little time to let the firey aftertaste burn through her mouth and throat.<br>
The glass clattered a moment on the table, and Arton was laughing, reaching over the table and Barak was at her side, both inquiring something she could not hear over the roaring in her ears and the blessed fire that was burning a fast pace through her veins. Barak was wiping her tearing eyes and Arton was pushing bread at her, telling her to eat again and she gave them both a rather loud hiccup in reply.<br>
Gretta’s bustling in as they were trying not to laugh at Firatha’s near-instantaneous drunkenness brought a wince from Barak’s wife, though she knew it would not last long as Barak himself burned through alcohol as he did food. But she took Firatha from the men, scowling and trying not to laugh herself after a moment, taking her with the plate of bread and, finally, having Barak carry Firatha into the family quarters one floor beneath the city street proper, and set her on one of the guest beds with another loud round of hiccups.<br>
It was a gentle hand that pulled the covers over her, explaining there was a pot beside the bed if her stomach rebelled and that she was going to go murder her husband and Firatha was horrified at such a notion that something she had done would bring about Barak’s death. She pleaded with Gretta instantly, watching the woman’s horror turn to amusement as she explained that it was an expression, that her husband should have known better than to give her brandy of all things after eating only salad for the last hour. She patted Firatha’s hair and gave her a kiss on it, pulling the covers up and telling her to sleep and she would check on her in a while.<br>
Again, left alone in a strange bed in a strange room, she stared into the darkness, hiccuping quietly to herself and wishing her pet were here. She had not brought any bones with her due to being with Brisa, and she felt lonely without it there to talk to. She gave a deep sniff of the air, smelling, and hearing, the elder voices scolding one another, mostly Gretta’s scolding the men. The brandy was not so much burning her stomach and throat now, and she felt sleepy, closing her eyes for just a moment to wonder why she was so sleepy and it claimed her instead.<br>
It was Arton who woke her when circumstances demanded it, and a warm mug of heavy soup was pushed at her. He asked if she had slept the whole night through, and as she had little memory of anything beyond the brandy, she nodded to it. He touched her hair as the others did, though she noted his fingers lingered for a moment longer and watched him, his eyes sad.<br>
Brisa had come up missing, somehow, during the night, and Gretta and Barak were in a state of not knowing where to begin searching.<br>
