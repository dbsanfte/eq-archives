Four months came and went after the horrors of the Guild Council's Judgement, four months where each day brought new horrors and more and more talk of insanity.<br>
Antonanth Hopeseeker had been banished from the cities...and had been met outside the city's gates by Lord Mistmoore's wizard, and the three of them had vanished. There was no word from Faydwer as to what was happening there, save that some of the elves were attempting to regain control of Felwithe with supplies from Kaladim and the Outpost. The silence concerned Roderick and Chathal the most.<br>
From Freeport, the holdings that had belonged to the Hopeseeker family had been seized by the Freeport Guild, being tallied up at current market prices and then sold...and the money vanishing before it ever reached the Guild Hall. There were rumors there of what had happened to it, as well as other mysterious thefts and rumors of people vanishing on a daily basis.<br>
Qeynos had it little better, though Lord Lanadan had been expecting repercussions. With the assistance of the Necromancer's Guild, they were at least one, sometimes two steps ahead of the pilfering, the disappearances, and they were also determined to find out exactly where in Faydwer this castle resided.<br>
It was, very shortly, coming to a matter of Mistmoore Castle would have to be invaded to know what was happening. Roderick feared for the lives of his fellow Knights if that happened.<br>
Chathal had opened up the city to his old friends, giving them access to everything it had to offer, and there was no surprise when Tiabrin and Tallik all but fell into one another's arms one night with knowing grins. Former lovers and, had circumstances permitted at the time, perhaps more, she brought a smile to Tallik's face, and he gave her something to surface to from the Healers Halls that was not magick and spells and musty books.<br>
Roderick was joking that it was about time for his old friend.<br>
Chathal himself had taken a wife several years earlier, who sadly was unable to produce children of her own, but they had adopted four healthy ones from the Guild, and once she was Guild Lady, Roderick had no doubt that Gynath would have more children than she ever dreamt of for the rest of her life.<br>
Of Tiabrin and Lady Alamathea...they were seldom seen apart, when Alamathea was seen at all. It became a game for the children of Erudin to see who, each day, might be the only one to glimpse the elusive Library Lady.<br>
Roderick had chuckled the first time he'd heard her called that, and he had been hard pressed not to tell her what they were doing over dinner one evening. She smiled so rarely now; if anything gave him that look, then he was welcome to speak it.<br>
The Library Lady herself was simply that each day...waking in the small room Tiabrin had given her and then going into the Library to study, study study. At least, she noted in a weary exhultation to Tiabrin one afternoon, she wasn't being schooled in swordplay. Even Roderick had commented she was worthless for the most part with anything with an edge on it.<br>
How long had he known also wore on her, to which even Tiabrin had reminded Alamathea that other people had prevented her Training in the Healers Halls. There was nothing Roderick could have done then, but he certainly was making her do so now.<br>
Waking brought the duties of seeing to the sick, consulting with the Healers of what was to be done today as far as research, going to homes to tend to the ill and elderly, and perhaps journey out into the forest for herbs to be found and dried for future use. Mid afternoon found her normally in deep study, if she had not been during the morning. It was rare to find her without her nose in a book, or out tending to the ill most days, though Tiabrin always made some excuse that Roderick was there for her mealtimes. Upon being questioned about this, Tiabrin only smiled at her.<br>
“You do enjoy his company, don’t you?”<br>
“Well, yes...but he’s stated many times that...”<br>
Tiabrin had waved off whatever she’d been about to say, leaving the pair of them to their mid-day meal and returning only later to find Alamathea nose deep in another book...or dozing long after it was time to have eaten, her face pillowed by an open book.<br>
Roderick and Chathal were also learning of what was happening in Freeport, thanks to a handful of Erudites there in the Guild Hall, who had happened to have simply been in the wrong place at the wrong time come Roderick’s return from Faydwer under Charges of Abduction. Chathal was rather disturbed by the quick sale of all of the Hopeseeker holdings, and had himself sent several notes to both the Lord of Freeport and Lord Narson of the Guild Hall, asking what was to be kept for Lady Alamathea, who had not been Banished.<br>
The terse notes in return had come to light that Lord Narson was also looking for the Lady Alamathea, as she had been promised to him by Antonanth himself, and he felt he was due the young woman “if no one else will provide for her safety and well being”. Chathal, Roderick and Tallik had only shared a knowing glance. The Hopeseeker holdings, when the tally of their worth had finally been made public...or, at least, when Chathal had been able to get his eyes on a copy of the estimated holdings...even the Lord of Freeport had been one to raise an eyebrow.<br>
Lady Alamathea, the sole heiress to a rather extensive list of holdings, now sold off, as well as land trusts, also sold now or seized, was becoming a rather wealthy woman...if someone could perhaps discover just where the final money had gone to. In her Name, Chathal had made several heated scrolls full of arguments and their own Guild Laws, stating that Lady Alamathea had been thrown to the wolves by the very Guild Council that should have protected her, and that if no one in Freeport could own up to whom had taken the money owed her, perhaps the Freeport Guild was in debt to her quite a substantial amount of money and land.<br>
Scrolls also went out, on a near-daily basis, to Qeynos, as the shipping routes were being re-established, as well as lumber being sent down to the city from Erudin to rebuild the docks as best they could. Roderick held himself responsible for Alamathea’s escape, for her not being given to Lord Mistmoore as well as fully opening himself up for Banishment as well as true Charges of Abduction now.<br>
Illiysha’s replies to such were that she demanded to know when she was going to finally become a grandmother to her favorite son’s future wife. He had opened that particular scroll without knowing its contents, and had turned a lovely shade of red before Chathal and Tallik and some of their Erudin allies.<br>
Despite her well wishes for Roderick, Illiysha was also not above warning Roderick that Lanadan, bound by the same Guild as his son, might have to truly being up Charges against him, as this was the second time he had “taken” Lady Alamathea from somewhere, or someone, she belonged to. Though there was no official documents, no parchment nor paper anywhere, that stated Lord Narson had been given Lady Alamathea’s hand. Through divine intervention it seemed, Antonanth had never written down his promise before leaving Freeport for Qeynos. Chathal said they were truly being guided from above. Roderick and Tallik were not as optimistic and said their luck would run out soon.<br>
Lanadan’s letters to his son were no less warm, though they were much more official than those of his busybody wife. No one, as yet, had heard a formal protest from Lord Mistmoore that his prize from the Guild Council was still missing and, as yet, undelivered. There were scrolls coming and going via druid ‘ports six times daily, Felwithe time, to ensure that everything was well there, and that a second attack was not happening. Lanadan had also sent some of his own to Felwithe to help with the rebuilding efforts. It was coming fall, and even in the eternal greenery of Faydwer, without the trees to protect the city and its outside lands, there would be an interesting season for them all.<br>
He spoke to his son of Duty and Honor, reminding him that if he was brought up on Charges, he would have no way to protect Roderick from the outcome. Roderick understood this, and thanked his sire for his openness in the matter.<br>
Though, he was also shocked when a scroll arrived, very late at night for Qeynos, as they were finishing their mid-day meal in Erudin. Lanadan had been musing to himself, and inquiring if the Lady Alamathea required anything from the city, perhaps some clothing, something befitting her status as a Noble, maybe something Roderick might like to assist her in choosing.<br>
Tiabrin, not expecting the note’s contents, had read it aloud as she always did to Roderick and Alamathea, as they sat at the mid-day meal. It had been to a rather red-faced Knight she had looked up to, and a young woman trying to look very interested in her plate of food instead of the man across from her.<br>
“And he even knows your proper fitting sizes, Alamathea,” she had giggled at them both, taking a leave of them with a rather dimpled grin.<br>
Four months of the threat of Lord Mistmoore taking siege to Erudin had worn on her mind, though it was noted by the Healers Hall that she was learning, and very quickly. Tiabrin herself was a Healer of great magick, though she often noted to Chathal and Tallik that Alamathea was long far past what she herself could do to heal the ill. And recounting what had been told to her of Felwithe’s injured, she stated she was surprised that they had not realized it then.<br>
Tiabrin did what she could to keep the young woman’s mind off the threat of the Lord of Mistmoore Castle. She took Alamathea to the marketplace, finding they were both of a similar mind to some things and brought along several of her friends to make it an outing of enjoyment. She had somehow managed, each time, to bring Roderick along as an escort, despite there being little if no threat in such a crowded marketplace for either abduction or attack. If Alamathea still did not realize she was slowly being manipulated, she made no say of it.<br>
Roderick himself was more amused now, having put up with many years now of her pestering him for a union, her grin no matter what corner he turned in the Guild Hall, his armor spotless from unseen cleanings despite it had not seen battle that day. Even his bloody horse had liked her, and Tallik had not been one to get near the beast under any circumstances, friend and general or not.<br>
Then came the flowers.<br>
It had begun as an accident, something Tiabrin herself had had to vouch for, having seen the incident from its beginnings. A young squire had been taking the daily bunch of flowers into the Healers Halls and the Library, passing Lady Alamathea’s doorway and having dropped one by accident, pausing to give a bow to Tiabrin as she came to knock on the young woman’s door. The young lad had gone on his way, and Tiabrin had taken up the flower after her knock, so that when the door opened, there she was, holding a flower for Lady Alamathea, who was more startled at it than her friend’s shocked face.<br>
It had been a weary look that Tiabrin had not second guessed, and she had grinned to her friend. “It was left here for you.” Which, in a sense, it had, though not by the party that Alamthea believed it had been left by.<br>
Tiabrin had been bubbling all the way to find Roderick, giving him no excuse, no matter how hard Chathal and his comrades chuckled, no matter how much Tallik was laughing, there would be no out of this. He was to bring a flower each morning to the foot of her threshold and leave it there for her.<br>
So began the little game of cat and mouse...she trying to wake each morning to catch him in the act, and he having to use all his tactical knowledge to avoid being seen by her in the act. Even the Library got into the grand scheme, and it went from an innocent prank to one that began to enfold nearly two dozen people each morning to ensure that Roderick was not seen.<br>
The flowers were, at first, nothing more than whatever could be found on such short notice, but when Illiysha somehow got wind of it, and how she did, even Roderick was going to take a sword to their throats when he found out the culprit. Illiysha had suggested, in a missal to Tiabrin of course, not her son, that perhaps certain flowers might be used on certain days, certain hours, and perhaps a note or two on occasion tied to the stalk?<br>
It was all growing into a rather elaborate farce, or so Roderick was often commenting with a scowl...though Tallik noted to anyone who would listen that his generalship was always up and stalking down the halls to lay the flower before the door.<br>
Four months led to five, without so much as a peep out of anything from Faydwer, and winter was slowly taking hold of the continent. Those few who had been away from the burning of the cites were reclaiming what they could. Kelethin had truly been razed to the ground, and even the sprouts of trees were having a time coming out of the baked ground from the firestorm. They had been given shelter in Felwithe, probably the first time such an offer had been made, and probably the last. The Felwithe Elves were not known for their generosity towards their cousins, though in times of dire need, past problems seemed to always be overlooked.<br>
Scrolls continued to come in from Felwithe, and Belerak’s letters, with copies sent to Roderick from Lanadan, confirmed that the rebuilding was coming along as best he could tell. As for the gnome lands, if any had survived there, he had not been told of it.<br>
It was an uneasy five months when it came to a conclusion, just a handful of days before the Solstice when the new year was celebrated and the old ushered out with grand fanfare. Erudin was one of the Ancient Cities, as Felwithe and the Outpost were, and to be invited to the Solstice there was a rather grand invitation.<br>
Tiabrin had been grinning from ear to ear when she found the men one particular morning. “There aren’t to be any lessons or books or ill today, I’m told...she insists on going to the market for something suitable to wear.”<br>
That in itself had been startling...Alamathea, forgoing the books and the study and the ill for a day? What was wrong with the child? It had brought laughter to them all.<br>
The morning ship, however, arriving with Illiysha and her best seamstress, had all but knocked them all back off their heels. Roderick was more afraid of the woman behind his mother than his mother’s appearance itself. And as he had during his childhood, with a resigned air he stood with a scowl and a dark glare for his measurements to be taken again.<br>
Of the Lady Alamathea, no one saw her the remainder of the day, though Tiabrin was shuffling back and forth to the market for things, and sending some of her squires on occasion when she was tired of shuffling for oddities.<br>
Chathal had spoken, at least for the Guild, it would be a quiet Solstice, or so he believed. The usual gathering of friends, family and Knights were coming home to be with loved ones and family for the occasion, and the city swelled probably double its numbers in a span of days.<br>
It was the custom, in Qeynos, for gifts to be exchanged on Solstice Eve, when the skies were their darkest and the moon shone brightest on the city, and most gifts were exchanged along the docks overlooking the water. In Erudin, Solstice gifts were given either the evening before or the morning of, dependant on the manner of gift.<br>
Illiysha had been at the docks, waiting on the boat bringing Lanadan in a rare journey from Qeynos on Solstice Eve, greeting her husband with her son at her side, who was rather uncertain to see his sire so soon after the events of the Council.<br>
Lanadan himself was uneasy also, but the difficulties were overcome quickly, at least, they seemed to be. Duty and Honor had been Lanadan’s only choices, and even he had not wanted to pass down the sentence he had, and Illiysha had spoken over and over again that it had not solely been Lanadan’s Council but that of the others as well.<br>
Roderick, politely, did not ask who had pushed for Lady Alamathea’s turnover to Lord Mistmoore. That, he knew, would come with time. But the thought that his own Guild was bargaining with the undead for the life of a young woman, so that they might live in peace for years? Was this Duty? Was this Honor? Was this any possible form of justice and harmony for them all?<br>
Lanadan had come in his finest, bringing one of Illiysha’s elder daughters in her own finery and carting Illiysha’s own gown for the night’s celebrations. Off she had shuffled with the young woman, filling her ears with what was and wasn’t to be done, all the while Roderick hearing his sire chuckling. “Girl’s never going to grow up if she doesn’t get out of the city soon. Lisha hates to let’em go...admits they’re grown up.”<br>
Roderick could only nod, knowing the litany he himself had gone through of finally nearly running away to be allowed to attend duties in Freeport. She meant well, but she was also a mother and wanted what was best for her children. That meant keeping them closely under watch, for if they were out of sight, there was no telling what mischief they might get into without her approval.<br>
Chathal was also there to welcome Qeynos’ Guild Knight and his Lady formally, Gynath coming out with their brood and welcoming them to their Guild Hall in absence of the Guild Knight, who was ill that evening and had given the festivities, finally, to Chathal to handle. Into the city and then the Library, seeing every last part of it, chattering away, and Tallik finally noting, rather loudly from Tiabrin’s arm in the main gathering hall of the Library, that they were missing someone.<br>
Roderick could have cheerfuly beaten the man without remorse, and was all the more irritated with the feeling of being set up when Illiysha looked with a rather cunning grin to Tiabrin.<br>
One of Tiabrin’s many squires went off in search of her, told not to return without her. Illiysha and Lanadan’s daughter was scanning the crowds also, nearly Lady Alamathea’s age herself and wanting someone “younger” to gossip with.<br>
It was an unusually long wait, despite their being in the Library to begin with, and Tiabrin was not the only one with a look of concern, watching the crowds part on occasion for a large group and then fold again into faces she knew, but not the face she was searching for. Finally, giving a quick whisper to Tallik, she patted his arm and left in search of both her squire and Lady Alamathea.<br>
The voices seemed loud in Roderick’s ears, his rising concern and the gift tucked into one pocket weighing heavily on his mind.<br>
A squire rushed into their little circle, not caring whom he knocked over, and not the young boy that Tiabrin had originally sent in search of Lady Alamathea. “Come, quickly! She doesn’t know what to do!”<br>
Several others had come with them, the group nearly thirty strong as they went up the stairs to the main halls of the Library and the doors leading to Lady Alamathea’s chambers...<br>
The doors...they were shattered...blown inward with a force strong enough to break ironwood off its hinges and splinter it with ease.<br>
Books lay scattered as leaves in the fall, half torn, face down, open to stare up at the ceiling with disbelief at their not being neatly tucked into their shelves. So many books scattered...but there was a pattern to them, a pattern Roderick pushed his mother aside to stare at.<br>
Someone had been throwing them, they were in bunches. In defense, or in damaging blows? He feared the answer to that question.<br>
Tiabrin was near one of the still closed doors, standing over the body of the young boy she had sent to find Lady Alamathea. “Whomever it was...”<br>
“We know who it was,” Roderick growled heavily, staring at the familiar walls that only hours before he had entered to ask if she needed anything else before Solstice, and had been ushered out by an anxious Illiysha.<br>
“Roderick...it couldn’t have been...”<br>
“WHO ELSE?!” He had turned to Lanadan, eyes hard and angry and then to Tallik. “Do you remember the way?”<br>
“Don’t have a choice, I have to remember the way now.”<br>
“I’m coming with you,” Tiabrin was saying, staring at the body of the boy, the devastation of the room and her missing friend.<br>
“I also,” Lanadan had said quietly, looking to his son with stronger will in his eyes now. “If this young woman’s to be daughter and kin, better the battle end now, Roderick, and take her back or let her go and be done it.”<br>
Chathal was waiting, Gynath taking the little ones and Illiysha’s daughter away from the room quickly, giving room to others who might aid as she could not at the immediate moment.<br>
He was turning to Tiabrin, scowling out orders, more in fury that someone had invaded the Library without a sound and taken someone entrusted into his care. The Knights were going to Faydwer, but not without knowledge.<br>
“Did she know what we were against?”<br>
Tiabrin nodded to that question. “She was very close to finding an answer to how he was originally bound by magick, and put back to sleep.”<br>
“And he has her...who else would know?”<br>
Tiabrin had looked around the room to the books. “The answers are here...she found them for the most part, we need to now also. We have to know what we’re up against before we get her back, Chathal.”<br>
“And we shall,” he vowed. He called up the Librarians, ordering that anyone with the knowledge to find anything of vampires be brought in and searching for a way to defeat them, or, at the very least, to contain them once again after they had risen.<br>
Lanadan’s hand had felt uneasy on Roderick’s. They had pushed him into a chair in the room of fallen and scattered books, fearing he might fall or worse. “She will be found, I swear this to you, son.”<br>
“She’ll be found because I won’t rest until she is...bodily or bruised.”<br>
He could only nod at his son, and he went to the books with the others, gathering up what he could and setting them on one of the tables, searching, page by page, for any information that might give them an edge to defeat Lord Mistmoore.<br>
“It will be morning, just rising, there,” Tallik had commented. “If we move quickly, perhaps we can get there before he knows we’re coming.”<br>
“Without information we’re no better than we were the first time we met him in the castle.”<br>
“This time we know what we’re up against.”<br>
Roderick had shaken his head, fearing losing time with study, but fearing worse if they got there and could not destroy what was left of Lady Alamathea.<br>
“We don’t have a choice now...we have to trust that she found something, and they can find it again.”<br>
“And we have,” Illiysha said, pressing something into Roderick’s hand. The leatherbound book, looking so like an older tome but in no script of Erudin, of the finely crafted work of Freeport’s own...to be staring at it...<br>
“Better for us that she kept a journal, Roderick, perhaps it’s in here.”<br>
He nodded to that, not knowing what to say. Many Knights kept journals of their happenings, and in times of trial or missing status, they were laid open for investigation to, perhaps, give some trace as to where they had gone to.<br>
Illiysha had given it to him first, and he gave her a grateful look and a nod, and opened it. If there were answers, she would have written them down, he knew her, but she would not have been open about them. She knew the dangers of magick and of writing down something blatantly in the open. No. Whatever she had discovered, it would be hidden, and he had to find out where, and how.<br>
And soon.<br>
He feared a second return to Mistmoore Castle...this time not for the safe return of a young woman missing, but to what that young woman might be when he found her again.<br>
