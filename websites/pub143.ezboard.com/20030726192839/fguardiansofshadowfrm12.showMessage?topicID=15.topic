It had been a simple question, he being one accustomed to strange sleeping hours and short naps, having woken when one of the Necromancers came with Tallik to inquire on their health.<br>
Beside him, wrapped heavily in blankets with only her nose and closed eyes showing, Lady Alamathea Hopeseeker slept the sleep of the mentally and physically exhausted. General Roderick Peacekeeper was not above asking if there might be a minor spell to keep her asleep for a while longer, to ensure that whatever was happening above their heads, when it came, she was conscious and ready to accept the judgement without a cloudy head.<br>
A simple spell, one even he himself understood but could not perform...or at least he should have been able to, had he had his wits with him.<br>
The reality of where they were, and what he had done to hide the young woman had come crashing down upon him when two of the oldest men he had ever encountered came into the room silently, looking to the younger, robed one, to Tallik and himself and then seated themselves after invitation.<br>
They were The Elders...and they were mightily curious as to why Roderick had requested Lady Alamathea brought down here, into the realm of semi-darkness and walking death.<br>
He had recounted what he and Tallik could of the proceedings above their head in the Guild Hall. The pair had listened attentively, having gotten some of this from the two Necromancers who had panicked at the sight of Lord Mistmoore.<br>
They had asked specific questions....how did Roderick feel his sire would vote in the matter, to which he himself had no possible idea. The vote had been unanimous, it had seemed, against keeping Lord Antonanth in the Guild, but that had been before the doors had been opened to admit Lady Alamathea and her two guests.<br>
They were simple questions, but they were thought questions, and in retrospect he should have guessed where they were leading. Had he not been as tired as he still was, sitting on the bed with his back against the wall, Lady Alamathea sleeping beside him, perhaps he might have guessed the conclusion that they were coming to.<br>
It was a simple one, rather easily put when he thought of it later.<br>
'What is the Guild going to do to rid of this beast?&quot;<br>
To that, even Roderick had no possible answers. It had been confirmed that, yes, Lord Mayong Mistmoore was indeed an undead walker, drinker of blood and souls and this frightened the Necromancer's Circle simply for the fact that their records for such creatures were probably as factual as Roderick's own Guild Hall was....such things did not exist, they were rumored, but had never been encountered.<br>
But...Felwithe had known. Shesa had spoken of books, and  he recalled Lady Alamathea stating something while there looking at the ruins of the city...something about undead fire. If there were records of such a beast, and he had once been subdued, they were to be found there.<br>
But the more wizened of the pair had looked at him, a gentle motion of open hands pointing towards him. Perhaps not directly at him, as he followed their path. &quot;So you do this for yourself and your Guild's freedom?&quot;<br>
He had nodded...but the Elder had shaken his head, a hand upraised.<br>
&quot;Why do you lie and say this is for your Guild....when it is for her you do this?&quot;<br>
Tallik had also been staring at Roderick, waiting for an answer that was obvious, and yet, not something to be admitted easily.<br>
&quot;If this must be done for her, to what goals? What do you seek to gain from this, other than harmony for your Guild? This will not bring it for perhaps generations, such is the mistrust within the ranks now...and she will not help matters, being the daughter of such a betraying soul.&quot;<br>
He had nodded, understanding what he had feared. Illiysha had been prepared to simply take the young woman under her wing until such time as she felt she could return to Freeport and her home and titles...if she ever did.<br>
When a Noble House was, on those rare occasions they were caught with their fingers openly in another's doings, and they was no escape for them but to admit their wrongdoing by accepting Guild Punishment, they were subject to whatever the Lord of the City would demand, after, of course, the judgement of the Guild Hall that is. A House could be fined heavily by their own Guild Hall, and then asked to leave the City, ultimately, by the Lord of the City if the circumstances were dire enough.<br>
What would remain of Lord Antonanth's holdings, of his Titles and Lands and so forth, only the Council would be privy to that, until such time as Lady Alamathea needed to be told. As it had been determined that she was, indeed, the last of the Bloodline and House, it would all fall to her shoulders after Judgement had been passed.<br>
&quot;She will survive...that is what matters now more than the Titles and the House she belongs to.&quot;<br>
The Elder had shaken his head. &quot;You still do not see, do you? If she is found to be a Healer, and she has the potential...this we can see in her. The magick in her is strong, and untutored, and a long road ahead she has to relearn all she has been kept from.&quot;<br>
&quot;She's stronger than you believe.&quot;<br>
&quot;She would have to be to have come this far and not give up on her own quest for what she wants.&quot;<br>
&quot;And that is?&quot;<br>
&quot;What is it every young woman seeks, what every young man seeks? It is affection, it is companionship, it is strength and solitude, it is compassion and caring. To wait for so long for another to see it and acknowledge it.&quot;<br>
&quot;You're not making any sense.&quot;<br>
The two Elders had simply smiled at him. &quot;So why do you ignore this, if it is something that means so much to you?&quot;<br>
&quot;Ignore what?&quot;<br>
&quot;Her...and what she has tried to offer to you. Perhaps now lost in that the waves of Justice might carry her away and never to return. The Healers Halls are not as open as your own, for Study is more necessary there than comradeship and swordplay.&quot;<br>
The thought of her gone again, at first, frightened him, but the ultimate image of her truly gone into another Guild Hall had concerned him more.<br>
They had sent her to the Healers Halls to keep her safe from her sire's entrance into the city. Now, finding that she was, truly, after Roderick's years and years of asking her to be Tested, she was truly a Healer, she would have years of study to remake. A lifetime's knowledge that must be known for the sake of the life of others.<br>
In seeking it, as he had once sought glory of battle and the thrill of the march, it would, in all probabilities, take her from him. He himself had been gone nearly four years when he had been sent into the Field those first years entrusted into the Guild to prove his worth and his skills.<br>
To have her gone again, after nearly two weeks of being closer than perhaps he had ever wished to be...or had he? The question had been an open, innocent one, but he noted that even Tallik was waiting for an answer.<br>
&quot;You choose not to answer, because you are thinking with your Duty and your Honor, but not with the heart you claim that we do not know in the depths here.&quot; The Elder was smiling, looking to the younger, robed Necromancer at the doorway. &quot;There are some of us who have Blood of our own, and have enjoyed the pleasures of flesh and feeling. And there is no shame in this.&quot;<br>
&quot;She is from a Noble House...&quot;<br>
&quot;...A Noble House probably to be stripped from her, given that she has been, ultimately, tainted by a vampire who attacked her, and has admitted to this. Despite affection and duty and all the honor that a man can give...do you truly believe the Guild can forgive and forget this, and no one, not a single man or woman ever being suspicious of her now?<br>
&quot;She was a victim...but she is also the only victim that the families of the dead will have to strike out at, once it is known what her sire did.<br>
&quot;Would you want to be the keeper of a Noble House after this comes to public opinion?&quot;<br>
The horrors of the last Noble House falling in Qeynos, when he had been a boy running errands through the Guild Halls...he could still remember the fires burning deeply into the night. The Lord of Qeynos, his now-dead father actually, had stated that the Nobles had to be out of the city by nightfall. But he, as others had in the past, had turned the other cheek as to what had ultimately befallen the family. So long as there were no bodies, that was the unspoken rule. Broken limbs, burns, wounds hidden beneath wrapped cloth...but no bodies. That was not allowed while Houses were sacked or simply burned for no one wanted the spoils of unjust people.<br>
The Elder's paper-thin skin felt warm and surprisingly baby-soft against his own fingers. &quot;Roderick of Qeynos, the life that she left behind her, when she went to investigate the tower, is simply that...it is behind her. There is nothing anyone can do now to bring it back to her, no matter if her sire were innocent or guilty. Too many have come forward to admit wrongdoing in your Guild Halls for it to go back to what it was.<br>
&quot;Accept what has happened...and what is being offered to you. There is no shame in this.&quot;<br>
&quot;She's too young...&quot;<br>
&quot;How old was your own mother, when she had your first brother? Fifteen I believe? Fourteen and nine days perhaps if I an not mistaken with time?&quot;<br>
Lady Alamathea was older than that, but the thought of taking her, admitting...<br>
Admitting what? That he did not want her to leave his side, now that he finally had her there, the pest, the nuisance, the laughter that had haunted him when she had been missing for nearly four days who knew where and he could not find her?<br>
Another Necromancer had come into the room, polite and in silence as the others had. Judgement was to be brought down at noon, four hours, and if there was sleep to still be had, now was the time to take it.<br>
Tallik had no second comments about more sleep, and the two Elders departed the room, the door being closed behind them and their young Necromancer guard outside the room.<br>
Leaving Tallik to stare at his general, his long-time friend, and wonder what was ultimately going to happen to them all. For Roderick himself was still under Judgement for what had happened, or supposedly happened, to begin the whole mess.<br>
He took one of the other beds, closing his eyes after a moment's chuckle and turning his back to Roderick.<br>
Roderick himself was staring down at the wrapped bundle beside him and wondering how life had become so complicated and so very clear within a short span of time. It was not something he had ever planned on when he had gone out onto the sands in search of his missing men and Lady Alamathea.<br>
The covers were no longer warm, but they were comforting, and he gathered them around himself, pulling the bundle against him for more mental protection as to what was coming than his own needs and fears. Four hours until everything came shattering down.<br>
He felt old...and knew that his sire was probably worse off than he would ever know.<br>
<br>
-----------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
They were woken with great courtesy, but also with haste. It had been instructed that they were to be woken at the last possible moment of time that would ensure they could be taken up to the city's streets.<br>
Tallik had slept in his armor, having no cares about chafed shoulders as he was long accustomed to them. He assisted Roderick into his armor, though was a bit startled when Lady Alamathea was allowed in the room. Not something that normally would have been permitted, but Roderick also noted that she had helped him off with his in Felwithe without incident, and this was not the time for such prudish thoughts.<br>
Tallik had only chuckled, scratching the side of his chin thoughtfully and nodding.<br>
Lady Alamathea's armor was a lovely blend of a deep blue and a silvery-gray, in liquid chains and smaller plates that Roderick and Tallik admired for a few moments as they helped her into it. She was accustomed to the Guild armor that had been given to her by her sire, not the loose, form-fitting sheen of chain and light mail.<br>
She said it made her move easier, and she didn't feel so much a stone when she moved, which made them all give a moment's grin.<br>
But the Necromancers were insistent...they must come, and they must go to the Guild Hall, for the decision was to be issued at noon.<br>
Despite his misgivings of their first journey down into the Necromancer's realm, they were taken up a different route quickly, by magick and by a suddenly flash of light that both blinded them and prevented him knowing exactly where they had come out. The light blinding him suddenly as they went from near total darkness to sunlight of near-noon and then being pushed down the stone street was more than his mind could possibly comprehend.<br>
Did it truly matter, he asked himself several moments later, as he could finally make out objects without squinting again. Did it matter if he knew where there was another tunnel into the aquaduct system?<br>
To his surprise, the Elder who had asked the most questions was their guide back to the Guild Hall. With his hood drawn back from his face, feather-light white hair blowing back as he moved, he reminded Roderick of one of the many elder folk he had been assigned to in his first years in the Guild Hall.<br>
It was also rather well that the Necromancer Elder came with them, for within three streets of the Guild Hall, they found they had come to a roaring stop due to the curious crowds.<br>
The Elder led them through the crowds with an ease that Roderick believed even Alamathea thought inventive. Having lost her many times in crowds on market days, he knew that for her to not be able to keep up with someone put them in Roderick's good graces...for no other reason than to see Alamathea outwitted for once.<br>
They stopped suddenly, coming up against a rather sturdy wall of young Guild Knights, who were suddenly eager to stare at the Elder. More than one face was looking with concern, several with rising irritation, but all suddenly came to attention when Roderick dragged Tallik and Alamathea out of the crowds behind him.<br>
&quot;The Guild Knight's son has returned!&quot; Roderick winced at that, but there was nothing he could do to take the words back now. The Necromancer Elder only gave the young man a patient look.<br>
&quot;He will learn soon when he is assigned a much more exciting duty.&quot;<br>
Roderick could think of a few to send him on as well.<br>
Illiysha herself came to the barred doorway, the eight young men parting as she clucked behind them and gave a gracious half-bow to the Elder Necromancer, startling Roderick by allowing him to kiss her hand.<br>
&quot;Be welcome again, Waylar.&quot;<br>
&quot;The pleasure is, again, mine, Lady Illiysha, though I have some ruffians with me whom I am told might belong to you.&quot; He motioned to Roderick, Alamathea and Tallik, to which Illiysha gave them a scathing look. Where they had gone had frightened her, as no one could find them, but obviously Roderick had taken them to a place of safety and she would deal with him later.<br>
&quot;Oh, Tallik I believe we can bring into the Guild Hall, but the other two...I'm sad to state but they have other fates ahead of them.&quot;<br>
&quot;If you put me on the peeling line again, Mother, I am going to have a word with my sisters about how to curse in Elvish.&quot;<br>
She waggled her fingers at him, delighted for a moment but she was pale also. She was also in her armor...Roderick could not recall ever having seen her in the armor that his sire had bestowed on her for their wedding day. He was amazed that it still fit, for after so many children she was no longer slender, but it had fit her, and there she stood in it.<br>
Lady Alamathea, however, was rigidly silent, and Illiysha's eyes finally turned to the young woman. She reached out, brushing the young woman's face with her own worn one. &quot;And you, lovely Alamathea...were you anyone else right now and we'd be so much the happier for having you.&quot;<br>
Roderick looked to Tallik in alarm, who gave him a look of concern also.<br>
&quot;Mother...&quot;<br>
Her sad eyes looked from the young woman to Roderick, staring at the pair of them as the brightness that had been there momentarily was gone.<br>
She took Roderick's hand, leading him into the Guild Hall. Tallik, the Necromancer Elder and the young woman who had begun it all coming in behind them.<br>
It was a whisper he barely caught, Illiysha moving very close as they walked towards the hall where the trial was being held. &quot;Please, Roderick, please understand the politics involved here.&quot;<br>
&quot;If you're going to throw her to the wolves, I have a thing or two to say myself.&quot;<br>
&quot;Lanadan is doing what he can, but there are other things preventing this.&quot;<br>
&quot;I don't give a care what Sire is doing...other than he'd better have the right Judgement when it's read.&quot;<br>
Illiysha stopped, waving the others past her to stop several steps up in front of the barred hall doors. Two older Knights stood guard, and one was already knocking so that they could be opened from within.<br>
&quot;Roderick,&quot; she said, pushing his hair back as she had when he had been younger and new to his life. &quot;You know how the Guild works now...you knows its ins and outs and how people perceive us and all the rigamarole that goes with it. You know it, I know you do. You have to trust Lanadan right now in that what he's about to do...there was no other choice.&quot;<br>
&quot;Why don't I think I'm going to enjoy walking in there, Mother?&quot;<br>
&quot;Because you're not...because I fear this might be the last I'll ever see of you. And give a mother a moment of peace to know what her son looks like before she lets him go into the arms of another.&quot;<br>
That silenced him, but only for a moment.<br>
&quot;There can be only one outcome from this, Mother.&quot;<br>
She was shaking her head at him. &quot;You know...up here.&quot; She tapped his forehead with one of her thick fingers. &quot;You're thinking down here,&quot; she said, tapping his breastplate. &quot;You know in your head that there were three outcomes to this trial, and that Lanadan and the Council will do what they can. But as this is a GREAT Council, Roderick, you don't have a choice but to obey what's handed down for a sentence.&quot;<br>
He was silent again, for through everything, his sire had been at the forefront of it all. He had also forgotten that there were others who would wish their own brand of judgement brought down on Lord Antonanth. Vreaa especially, as it was his distant folk whom had been slaughtered in Felwithe. He wondered, again, if anyone had gone into Kelethin and seen if there might be any survivors. It was a hope, anyway.<br>
Illiysha was turning him towards the doors, and the Elder Necromancer was peering into the noisy hall. &quot;Illiysha, permission is granted?&quot;<br>
&quot;You may enter the hall, Old Friend,&quot; she said, brushing something from her eye as she stared at Lady Alamathea, and then to her son, releasing his hand and walking with them into the former dining area of her Guild Hall.<br>
The Council were at their seats, Lord Antonanth seated before them. A smaller, but no less elegant table had been set aside to the right for Lord Mistmoore and his wizard companion.<br>
Roderick saw nothing but his sire sitting up on the raised chair, to the other faces he had either heard of at some point or knew personally from encounters through the Guild. Illiysha had given her husband a brief nod, and then gone off in another direction, leaving them to stand before the Council.<br>
More to the point, Tallik and the Elder Necromancer were escorted away, leaving Roderick to stand watch over Lady Alamathea before the Council, no less than four steps from her sire.<br>
It seemed to Roderick that his own sire had aged overnight, and perhaps he had. This was not something one wished to have in their lifetime, and be the one to have to bring down Judgement on another's head.<br>
&quot;Please rise, Lord Antonanth Hopeseeker of Freeport.&quot;<br>
He did so, staring solely at Lanadan as he did, for Qeynos was hosting this, and he was the one to bring down Judgement, with the Lord of Qeynos behind him in his own chair, listening to the words for his own benefit.<br>
&quot;Lord Antonanth Hopeseeker, Knight of Honor and Duty, this Council has convened both itself and its findings of guilt or innocence of wrongdoing to one Lady Alamathea Hopeseeker of Freeport, your surviving child and daughter, at the hands of one Lord Mayong Mistmoore of Faydwer.<br>
&quot;Of conspiring for her death at the hands of one said Lord Mistmoore, of the deaths of half a battalion of Knights under leadership of General Roderick Peacekeeper of Qeynos. Of assistance with the bribery of Felwithe Knights to ensure they would not rise up against the invasion that destroyed their city. Of the assistance with bribery and promises of wealth with the destruction of Kelethin. Of the admitted attempt to have General Roderick Peacekeeper Banished from the Guild Hall that sent him out to search for Lady Alamathea Hopeseeker after she was listed as missing.&quot;<br>
On and on the charges went, nearly an hour's worth of them to which Roderick felt Lady Alamathea's shoulders begin to fall slightly with each one. This was her sire, for good or for bad, they were speaking of. She had not seen her siblings in many, many years now, and knowing that she would, now, never see them again for they were dead, was something Roderick knew would haunt her for a lifetime.<br>
Lord Lanadan drew himself up, taking a scroll from the small table before him, and opening the seal slowly.<br>
&quot;It is the Judgement given now, by the Guild Council, that follows.<br>
&quot;Lord Antonanth Hopeseeker of Freeport, you are hereby Banished from the Guild of Knights, forbidden all rank, rights, duties, men and monies that go with this as well as all holdings and lands.<br>
&quot;You are forbidden to the cities of Freeport, Qeynos, Kaladim, Felwithe, Kelethin, the Outpost of Firiona Vie, Highhold Keep and are to register yourself if you must use the Highhold Pass to cross from one area of the continent to the other. If you enter the lands of Erudin, you are to be hereby warned that no warning will be given and you will be killed upon recognition.<br>
&quot;You are required, by sunset this day, to relinquish in writing all holdings, monies and land to the Guild Hall in Freeport, to one Lord Narson who has spoken on your behalf in the past. The Guild shall take over these holdings.<br>
&quot;You are ordered to be gone from this city by sunset, to be escorted out to the gates and watched departing by the Lord of the City and this Guild Council, never to return.&quot;<br>
It was a death sentence for all it was worth, and Roderick winced, as he noted others did. But there was triumph in the eyes of some of the elves, and Belerak himself was nodding with each reading.<br>
That, however, would not bring back the dead, or the cities as they were.<br>
But he looked up at the silence, to see his own sire looking rather uncomfortable as he lowered one scroll and took up another, turning to Lord Mistmoore, who rose slowly.<br>
&quot;This Guild Council has acknowledged one Lord Mayong Mistmoore of Faydwer, and having acknowledged his presence, we are at an impasse as to one matter.<br>
&quot;Being not yet of an age within the Guild Hall, and still under the protection of her Sire, we are hereby ordered to hand over one Lady Alamathea Hopeseeker of Freeport, as payment for the deaths of sixty-three of Lord Mistmoore's own guard.<br>
&quot;With this payment, he shall cease and desist all future attacks on Faydwer itself, and shall keep to his own holdings, and bother none again.&quot;<br>
Something fell before him, and he stared down at Lady Alamathea on her knees, staring up at the Council, to her Sire and then to the Lord of Mistmoore Castle, who was smiling at her.<br>
Politics, Illisyha had warned him....politics to save a continent. he tried to remember how to breathe.<br>
&quot;At sunset of this day, Lady Alamathea Hopeseeker of Freeport shall be escorted to the gates and given to one Lord Mistmoore, where she is to be treated with the rights of her Nobility, and with this action, Lord Mistmoore is bound to upkeep his written promises to Faydwer and this Guild Council.&quot;<br>
Tallik's hand was on his shoulder, pulling him back from rushing his own sire. Illiysha was moving towards Alamathea, but Roderick felt nothing but his gloved hand against Tallik's.<br>
The gloved hand of a friend, a companion...and a young man who knew what it was to be outnumbered, and have no escape but death.<br>
Something was pressed into Roderick's hand, a familiar something, and he looked to Tallik, whose eyes wished him farewell. The farewell of a friend who knows the journey has ended, and there is nothing more to do or say but follow to the unknown.<br>
Tallik's courtly gesture of helping Lady Alamathea to her feet, looking to the Council and then to the grinning Lord Antonanth to his left, to the smiling Lord Mistmoore to his right, and he turned to Roderick. The young woman he was helping to support, pulling her gently from Illiysha's grip, was suddenly pushed towards Roderick as he gripped the 'portal stone, and Tallik gripped Roderick's hand also.<br>
Treason they were performing...the Guild would have them all Exiled for this.<br>
There was a moment's look before the 'portal swallowed them, to his own sire, to the look of triumph on Lord Lanadan's face. There was no horror of betrayal or shock or anger...only the realization that, somehow, someone had saved Lady Alamathea's life from what he had been forced to give her to.<br>
And it had been Lanadan's own words that had given Tallik the key to where they had been to go.<br>
The brightness, after the dim and crowd of the Guild Hall, was startling, and Roderick kept a tight grip on Alamathea's waist to keep her on her feet.<br>
No surprise when the two Knights who were standing on the dock looked at them, bowing.<br>
&quot;General Peacekeeper of Qeynos, you are nearly an hour late in coming.&quot;<br>
&quot;We're expected?&quot;<br>
A flash of brilliant teeth, and the movment of robes and skirts. Two more were coming to escort them. &quot;It was hoped you would find the stones and come to us....with her.&quot;<br>
The horror on Lady Alamathea's face as she looked around, staring at the spires, the minarets, the water and the docks and everything was spinning.<br>
Roderick held her for a moment before she fell again, wrapping her in steel and blood embrace as Tallik did the same with a hand on her shoulder. &quot;You are safe, Thea, you are safe now. This is a land of peace, a land of learning where you'll be safe.&quot;<br>
Over and over he whispered it against her hair, until he felt her not as stiff in the shoulders, the horrors in her eyes not as great, but he knew the shock would wear off soon.<br>
To Erudin's great city, he looked to Tallik and then to his old friend, Chathal, of Erudin's Guild Hall. They had been young friends together, going from Erudin to Qeynos and back for Training before they had both been sent to Freeport for further instruction. Chathal, upon the death of his sire, had returned to care for his many siblings, for his mother had died many years earlier, and Honor bound him to care for them.<br>
He was, it was rumored, Guild Knight in all but name now, for the man assigned to it had Named him successor this past season, but had asked for the spring to turn the Guild over to Chathal so that he could ensure the Guild would be as it should be for the transfer.<br>
Chathal welcomed Roderick with a hand on his shoulder, and did the same to Tallik. Beside Chathal, in her own armor but without sword, was one of his many sisters, Tiabrin, who welcomed them with a warm smile and a hand on each of their shoulders, as was the Erudin custom.<br>
To Lady Alamathea, shaking and swept up in Roderick's embrace, Tiabrin took her into her arms and held her. &quot;There's no shame in crying, sister. We all have to at some time.&quot;<br>
Only then did Roderick notice Tiabrin was in the same armor as Alamathea...a Healer herself. He looked to Chathal, who was smiling at the pair.<br>
&quot;Finally brought to us to be Trained...we welcome the challenge.&quot; He brushed Alamathea's hair from her eyes and patted her head as an elder brother would do. &quot;For today, we shall rest you three, and I must hear of what happened with the Council before the scrolls reach us.&quot;<br>
&quot;It was rather boring...&quot;<br>
&quot;YOU three were there, we were here by choice. We sent no one by choice, as I didn't wish anyone tainted by it. And...and it was hoped that Waylar would get you the stones in time.&quot;<br>
&quot;Waylar?&quot;<br>
Chathal nodded, walking towards the steps that led to the city, the salt air rising around them in the warm sunlight. &quot;Waylar comes and goes often from here, a rather welcome sight as he helps us understand the other Guilds and what they do. And he offered to help us get you three out of there.&quot;<br>
&quot;He put the stones?&quot;<br>
&quot;It was his hope that Tallik would find them after you did, but he's such a resourceful beast.&quot;<br>
To that, Tallik could only grin in return. Chathal and Tallik were old friends also, their sparring matches legendary as Roderick's were in Qeynos.<br>
Tiabrin was moving away with Alamathea, though Roderick's concerned look stopped them. &quot;We have a seperate area for her at the moment,&quot; Chathal was saying quietly. &quot;I don't believe she would wish to hear the Council's ruling a second time?&quot;<br>
Roderick nodded to that, moving over to set another kiss against Alamathea's hair, and a startling one against her lips that left her staring at him through the haze of horror that held her.<br>
&quot;YOU get well, do you understand me? You're with friends here, friends who don't care about Councils and vampires and sires. And tonight, you'd better be well enough to dine in the Guild Hall, as we have matters to discuss.&quot;<br>
Tiabrin was giving him a mock glare. &quot;I DO believe we might be able to restore her to her previous beauty, WITHIN the time limit you've given us.&quot;<br>
She sighed heavily, dramatically, and he gave her a wink and a nervous grin. Turning with the startled Alamathea, she led the young woman up the steps into the city, leaving the men to stare, and then to look around.<br>
&quot;Come, this isn't going to tell us anything that happened, standing here. You must tell me everything, everything, so that we know how to protect ourselves if he attacks.&quot;<br>
&quot;If he attacks? Are you insane?&quot;<br>
Chathal was grinning back to Tallik, pausing on the steps to share a smile with Roderick. &quot;Tallik, my old grunty friend, we WELCOME an attack by Lord Mistmoore...who do you think it was to begin with who gave Felwithe the knowledge to bind him to sleep for several thousand years?&quot;<br>
He pointed up to the highest minaret. &quot;The library...if there are still records and answers, we're searching for them. And we'll find them.&quot;<br>
&quot;And she'll be free.&quot;<br>
Chathal was laughing now, clapping Roderick hard on the shoulder. &quot;If you'd only done this a decade ago, you know we wouldn't be here now, you old musty generalship. And you'd have probably a dozen little feet demanding your attention daily.&quot;<br>
To that, Roderick found himself a rather deep shade of red, much to Chathal and Tallik's amusement, and they went into the city to discuss matters.<br>
