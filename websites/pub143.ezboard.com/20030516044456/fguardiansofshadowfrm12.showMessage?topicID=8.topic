<br>
Even with sleep, the reasons eluded him as to how the dark elves had gotten into the city without some form of magick warning them of the impending danger. The reason that came to mind in that someone, one of Tunare's Own might be in collusion with Lord Mayong was more than even Daliea's Trained patience could handle.<br>
But...the few survivors knew that one of their own had returned the night of the destruction. He had been tall, with hair of two shades, a youngster come to rest his head in the Homeland's Halls of Magick for one night's rest.<br>
Roderick wondered how far back someone had been planning this, how many other matters he had missed simply because he had not been focused on what was around him, and determined to find either truth or absolute proof of treason against Lord Antonanth.<br>
Lady Alamathea had vanished long before he had woken. No true surprise, as, in some girlish way, she also knew the consequences of anyone finding them together, chaste and untouched she might have been. Even he knew there was little hope of finding a reason for her sire's treachery if he was involved on a personal level.<br>
He had not seen her that morning, though Tallik and his men had caught glimpses of her, moving from one injured to the next, the magick flaring lightly against wounds that would not heal...or releasing the mortally into the realms of the beyond. Shesa had put her in charge of the most critically wounded, as Daliea's own mind was a mess of still trying to find Telerath's whereabouts, and the horrors of her own home in ruins.<br>
Word had been sent, when it was cool enough to walk on the remains outside Felwithe, to Belerak in Kaladim to send what supplies he could for those who would require them. The demand to bring the worst of the wounded to Kaladim was refused, by Shesa of all people, who determined that the wounded could not get any different healing if they were in Kaladim and moved, jostled, roughed from the journey there and then settled in darkness that Dwarves loved best. She stated that the wounded would remain where they were, and Roderick could not find a better argument, other than if the city was once again attacked, there would be no saving them.<br>
Shesa's own glare at his words had reminded him that if they invaded again, there would be nothing left to care for at that point. Magick was involved, a magick even she had not encountered before, or Daliea, and if the city was to be invaded again, what was to be gained? All of use had either gone up in flames or been taken elsewhere by the invading force.<br>
Roderick's own scrolls had been less hopeful of assistance coming from the Guild Halls. The news he gave only to Shesa, who looked at the scroll with heavy eyes, shoulders dropping once again, slightly.<br>
There had been an attack on Qeynos, his own city. There was little news, but the city itself had been under seige, Belerak wrote, and he had been asked to send assistance, to which he had refused, stating two cities were now dead in his jurisdiction and his obligations to them came first.<br>
Roderick wondered for his own Blood and Kin, if they were even alive now. He had a rather extensive family, two mothers and one sire, the first having died when his next-youngest sibling had been born. The eldest son still in the Field of his Sire's children, Roderick was the youngest son, the second mother having given nothing but daughters to her new husband. It was thankful they were of his own Blood or, as he liked to curse to Tallik, he'd have been married to one of them at birth.<br>
Tallik tried to avoid Qeynos when he could, for he, unwed himself, was often the subject of such discussions over meals in Qeynos.<br>
Roderick rubbed his eyes again, looking at the destruction and the small fires burning some of the wreckage so that they could get to other parts of the city. A flash of light hair was all he could see of her, half-stooped from one body to the next, her hands glowing with each Healing and her exhaustion rising. Shesa had the healers on two hour duties and then four hours of restful sleep to keep them going.<br>
He knew, somehow, Alamathea would find a way to get out of resting. She was as he was, driven by forces of caring and need for others that was not explainable in words.<br>
Daliea's investigations had finally, somehow, brought the whole horror into perspective, bringing Roderick and Tallik into the wizard's quarters near Felwithe's pool. Here they had worked in peace for centuries, casting spells and learning of tomes and knowledge.<br>
One of Felwithe's Own had come here that night, into a tiny guest room reserved for those who, as yet, had none to lay with and their own House doors were barred for the night, as was the custom against roaming animals and spirits searching for mischief.<br>
He had come here, asking shelter for the night, and had worked a magick to bring down the invading force. How he had gotten them into the tiny, marble, fire-blasted room was beyond speculation. No small force could have done what was around them, but the room itself would not have held more than perhaps eight, and even then it would have been shoulder to shoulder.<br>
He wondered what had happened, truly happened, and perhaps, some part of him did not wish to know it in full detail.<br>
The hard fact, however, was clear in that Felwithe would need supplies, and Belerak had promised those, though it would take a day or so to arrange for such a large number to be gathered. Roderick was also wondering what might had fallen the people he had sent with Teir`Dal bodies to Qeynos, to avoid Freeport's suspicion. Had he sent them into a war without knowing?<br>
Water supplies...fresh water supplies...were running low. Ash lay everywhere, and by late morning Daliea's report that only one of the multitude of wells in the city would be passable for water...not for drinking, but for cleansing the wounded as best they could.<br>
It was not a decision he wished to go back on, to countermand Shesa's words...but he had no choice. Without water, there would be no possible means to keep the wounded from dehydration. Kaladim would have to be sought out.<br>
Shesa said nothing, but understood the why. But that did not make it any easier to have to go among the wounded, explain they were being moved, and that when they were  in less critical condition, they might be allowed to return.<br>
Daliea had listened with dead ears. To her, Roderick was abandoning Felwithe to whatever fate had now latched its claws to it. She would not listen to reason, despite Shesa's calm words, and was finally sent back to heal the wounded as best she could, and to inform them that they would be heading to Kaladim's warrens.<br>
He wondered what Alamathea would have thought of his decision. His muttered comment brought Tallik's head up with an amused rubbing of his cropped hair. He did that when he was amused, or very, very nervous.<br>
&quot;She'll understand...she's a Healer.&quot;<br>
If only the world were that simple for a Knight.<br>
Roderick oversaw what moving he could do. Belerak's first wave of refugees would be arriving with the setting of twilight on the Butcherblock Mountains. Two druids were sent ahead to warn him of the coming exodus and of what supplies would be required first for their care and comfort. What few homes had remained had been gone over for clothing, as there would be nothing suitable for the wounded in Kaladim.<br>
The movement was not without loud protest, mainly as Daliea had done in protesting leaving the city's safety of walls, but Roderick had pointed out as gently as he could that the city's walls had not stopped an invasion from within. Most could not reply to that without looking away from his hard eyes.<br>
There were fourty in the first group, there would be thirty-nine in the second and the last group, which would be moving by darkness, would consist of fifty-four. The last group were people who were wounded lightly...broken arms, minor scrapes and burns, and could, for the most part, functionally fend for themselves. They would be moved last, though several druids were always standing in the circle of marble in Felwithe's great square. If the shout to leave the city came again, they had been instructed to take as many out as they could, as quickly as they could, without question.<br>
One hundred thirty three remained of the Fall of Felwithe...and they were being led out by Roderick and his men to Kaladim.<br>
He felt as if the world were ending, watching their haunted faces as they were moved towards the tunnel to Faydark. Their eyes of sadness would haunt him forever, as would his command to send them there.<br>
Shesa was going with the first group, for she knew what they would need most of all. Daliea would be with the second group, and Alamathea had insisted on taking the third, knowing Roderick would be one of the last to leave, if he left at all.<br>
The wounded were gently lifted, carried as best could be done, and the first wave of refugees headed out from Felwithe along the ashes of Faydark towards Kaladim. Roderick stood at the city's tunnel, watching them go until he could not see them any longer.<br>
With Shesa's absence, Daliea was the ranking Healer, and he turned to her for helping to get the next group ready. She still could not feel Telerath, wracked with the pain of being separated from her mate and not being able to find his remains. There had been bodies, but not enough bodies to justify the invasion's dead. Her words were distant, as if speaking through a glass, but Roderick filed them into his mind.<br>
The bodies had been lined out for identification...but if she was saying there were not enough of them, where were the others?<br>
It was difficult to get Daliea moving in the direction of assisting the wounded with the guards around, preparing them for the journey. The few horses that had been brought into Felwithe and survived had been loaded with Shesa's wounded. The druids had brought in more of them as they could find them, wandering loose in the Faydark searching the ruins of the forest for others. Roderick was stunned, many years later, to learn they had been unicorns and not horses that had been ferrying the majority of the wounded to Kaladim. Memories he had of them were hazy, as were the memories of all save the wounded, who believed in them.<br>
It took persuasion, diplomatic training, and pure stubbornness to finally get Daliea to round up the next thirty-nine wounded to have them ready by mid-afternoon for the journey to Kaladim. Tallik had been hounding her, two guards following her with absolute polite courtesy inquiring whom was to be moved next, and Roderick's patience was nearly at an end. These were the woman's own distant kin, and she was moving as if drunk. He needed her healing skills as he needed her uncleared mind, and how to instill that into her, now, was nothing he had the time to do.<br>
Tallik and Alamathea, in the end, got the next wave of refugees moving, Daliea moving woodenly among the people, looking around at the sunlight, the sunlight for as far as she could see now. The wounded were also seeing the devastation, and the distractions of their needs were what she needed to keep her moving them towards Kaladim, or so Roderick hoped.<br>
The third wave would be moving out later than he hoped, under full darkness, and he stood watching Tallik and Alamathea outside the tunnel of Felwithe. The walls were burned, blasted by fire and destruction, and the fifty-odd remaining wounded were in better physical shape than the last two.<br>
But under darkness...even in the ashes of Faydark, there was danger.<br>
Alamathea turned then, looking at him with her gentle eyes...bone-weary from having worked most of the day on the wounded and ignoring Shesa's demands for a healing sleep. Her eyes were questioning him silently, and he looked away in shame. Damn her for knowing what he was going to ask.<br>
But she came up to him, Tallik beside her, gentle fingers on his arm again. &quot;They can be moved...but will it make any difference if we wait until morning to do so? They've already had enough sorrow.&quot;<br>
&quot;They have to be moved now, or not at all...and you have to go with them.&quot;<br>
&quot;My place is here. If they come again, you'll have no Trained Healer with you.&quot;<br>
A finger poked her nose, his face amused, his tone anything but. &quot;YOU cannot be risked. You should have gone out with the first group.&quot;<br>
She gave him a slap on the face, to which Tallik resisted the urge to draw his own sword. &quot;If you are keeping me behind because I am Lord Antonanth's Daughter, then you are as mistaken for doing so as you are stupid.&quot;<br>
She tried to push past him, his hand on her arm now, swinging her back. &quot;If you're going to play spoiled child, now is NOT the time for it...&quot;<br>
&quot;If you'd let me do what I was TRAINED to do, perhaps you'd see that I'm useful here and not in Kaladim!&quot;<br>
&quot;YOU don't understand what might happen if they come back for a second attack on Felwithe.&quot;<br>
Her eyes bit back at him, fingers stabbing back to the ruins of the city. &quot;I WAS here when it fell! Don't you dare lecture me on what I do and don't understand! I am NOT a child to the Guild any longer!&quot; Her hand pushed him away roughly. &quot;When are YOU going to understand that and stop protecting me?&quot;<br>
&quot;I'm not protecting you!&quot;<br>
&quot;Then let me do what I was Trained to do!&quot;<br>
&quot;And die in the process, if they return?&quot;<br>
Her eyes, clear and without fear, surprised him. &quot;Isn't that the risk we're Trained to take when we leave the Guild Halls? That some of us may not return?&quot; Her eyes challenged him now, ignoring Tallik's concerned face and his slowly shaking head. &quot;Isn't that why people grow concerned for others they care for? They're afraid they won't return?&quot;<br>
Roderick was shaking his head. &quot;I can't let you stay here the night, Alamathea. If they return, there will be no way to get you out of here. The druids will not remain here at night due to the spirits of the dead.&quot;<br>
&quot;Then send them with the wounded and leave me here. Even your minor healing skills won't keep men alive for long to reach the tunnel if they come again.&quot;<br>
He was too tired to argue with her, but her words had a meaning he could not ignore. She was the only Trained Healer he did have left in Felwithe. The critically wounded could not have been moved by the druids and their 'portals due to the intense cold on wounds. This group that he had assigned to Alamathea, however, had minor wounds...the majority of them broken limbs from homes crashing down on their heads.<br>
&quot;You can't stay...&quot; he began again, shaking his head, and her, both hands on her upper arms now to stress his point. &quot;I can't, in good conscience, let you stay here.&quot;<br>
&quot;And I'm not leaving without you,&quot; she countered, heels literally dug into the ash around them. &quot;The druids can move the wounded and I can remain here with your men.&quot;<br>
&quot;You can leave with the druids and I'll know you're safe.&quot;<br>
&quot;But I won't know if you are,&quot; she said softly, her honest, heartfelt words giving him no reply in return.<br>
She pulled away from him, staring up at him for a long moment, then looking to Tallik, eyes pleading with him to intervene. But even he knew it was not his argument. He was only a subordinate, and what was happening was quickly dissolving into a realm he did not wish to enter.<br>
Her voice was not something either of them had ever heard...soft and emotional, young and no longer the child innocent of battle and blood and death. &quot;If you stay here, and they come again...I'll never know what happened to you...only that you're gone.&quot;<br>
&quot;And I can't let you stay, because watching you fall to that same invasion would be more a nightmare than I want on my head.&quot;<br>
&quot;You have to let me stay...none of your men are Trained...&quot;<br>
&quot;A woman remaining here would only complicate the matter and you know this.&quot;<br>
A sad smile, her eyes now looking away with a chuckle. &quot;So...you won't let me stay, and I refuse to go.&quot; The eyes looked at him again, voice clear but wearily sad...regretful almost. &quot;Tell me, Roderick of Qeynos...how long are you going to protect me from your heart if you won't give me a chance to heal it?&quot;<br>
She turned from them, walking through the tunnel back to the city, leaving Roderick and Tallik to watch her go.<br>
A raised eyebrow at Tallik brought the man's hands up defensively. &quot;This is your problem, not mine. She can stay, she can go...you're in charge and this isn't one decision I'd even want to have to make if it were mine.&quot;<br>
Tallik went into the city also, knowing the wounded would need tending before they were sent to Kaladim.<br>
The marching of armor and feet brought them all to a stop nearly an hour later, nearly twilight, as the wounded were being readied for departure. Tallik met the Dwarven guards at the city's tunnel, conferring with them while Roderick and his remaining men got the wounded comfortable on horses, small, hastily-made wagons, anything that could be found that remained to move them.<br>
Tallik had returned to Roderick quickly, nearly frantic and looking at the men around him, to the wounded, to Alamathea suddenly staring at his silence and moving closer when, perhaps, she had no right to.<br>
&quot;Roderick...&quot;<br>
&quot;Did they bring the supplies with them?&quot;<br>
Tallik looked to Alamathea, pale and then back to his general.<br>
The booming voice was already speaking behind them, Belerak's own First Son calling out to him. &quot;Roderick of Qeynos, you are Summoned to the City of Freeport for the Charges that have been filed against your Name.&quot;<br>
Roderick looked to Tallik, to Alamathea and his men, the wounded now looking up with interest.<br>
He moved to the tunnel's entrance, staring at the Dwarven men in their armor with their swords and frowned. &quot;What is this? What charges?&quot;<br>
The scroll was passed over, as it had been read by Tallik, and now Roderick read it, staring at it, dropping it as his fingers willed it not to be true.<br>
Alamathea bent down, taking it up and staring at the dwarven men in turn. &quot;Abduction of a Daughter of Freeport? Collusion with unknown forces for the destruction of Felwithe? What lies are these? He did not abduct me...the foe against us did.&quot;<br>
A quick, deep bow to her as a ring of Dwarven Knights surrounded Roderick. &quot;Be it as it be, he's t'be sent t'Freeport fer th'Charges.&quot;<br>
&quot;Not without me,&quot; Tallik growled, though Alamathea shook her head at him, and he ignored her.<br>
To the commander, she drew herself up and looked down to him. &quot;As the Daughter of Freeport in question, I call Challenge to these Charges and demand that we be sent to Freeport together to investigate them, as Witness and Honor and Duty say it must be.&quot;<br>
The Dwarf was obviously not expecting this, looking to Roderick, surrounded by his guards, to Alamathea's cold face and Tallik's angered one.<br>
&quot;My Lady, you cannot speak on his behalf.&quot;<br>
&quot;Why not? I was the reason they went out searching for me.&quot;<br>
&quot;It was his men who sent you to the desert...and you will note whom is requesting these Charges in your Name.&quot;<br>
She stared down at the scroll, her damp hands staining it as she scanned it again, her legs giving out beneath her and both Roderick and Tallik helping her back up.<br>
Lord Antonanth of Freeport had levelled the Charges against Roderick...the entire House was behind this...<br>
Alamathea was drowning, staring at Roderick, at the dwarves and at Tallik, confronted by a foe she had no idea of how to face...<br>
Guild Politics...and her own Blood.<br>
Her own Sire was saying Roderick had taken her.<br>
Again, she looked to the dwarf, to Roderick and then to Tallik. &quot;Again, I say we will be sent to Freeport...and it will be done tonight.&quot;<br>
Another bow, but Roderick was pulled back, ringed by the guards once again. &quot;As the Lady wishes. We shall have the druids ready within an hour's time.&quot;<br>
A noble nod of her head, the scroll nearly destroyed in her claw-like grip on Tallik's steel-coated arm.<br>
She caught Roderick's eyes briefly, before they moved him to an area near the outer walls, where he could be watched but there was nothing of true value around to be used to escape. There was nothing to say, only the hope that, perhaps, she could reason with the House, understand what her sire was doing and why.<br>
But she knew the consequences of what was being done. Abduction was a sentence of Banishment from the Guild...and the abduction of one of the Noble Houses carried the price of whatever Justice the House demanded, it would be done, and there would be nothing the Guild Hall could do to save him.<br>
It was time to return to the only home she had known...and fight against the one person whom she had always believed the greatest man in her life.<br>
Her own Sire...instigator of the charges against Roderick and his men...<br>
The 'portals were opened last that evening, sending them all to Freeport, and Alamathea knew what must be done.<br>
