The Lord of Qeynos had come out, with the contingent from the Guild Hall, to meet the Freeport and Highhold groups and welcome them as best he could. If the matter came to a draw of both sides giving no quarter of argument, he would be the one to decide the ultimate fate of the accused. It had happened only once before, in a very heated matter several centuries earlier, when a Knight had taken a woman in battle for his own wife who, in turn, had been the wife of another, thought dead, and come home to find his claims gone and his house abandoned.<br>
Lord Lanadan Peacekeeper of Qeynos was standing beside the Lord of Qeynos, welcoming the two groups openly as best the circumstances would allow him to. His own son was part of this whole mess, a young woman he had come to delight in also part of it, but above it all, they were still men of the Guild Hall, and would act the part.<br>
Guild hospitality from Illiysha, whose culinary skills had long been the bane of many a waistline, including that of the Lord of Qeynos who often stopped by the Guild Hall for specifically that purpose, was offered, and Lord Narson, Lord Antonanth, and the rest of the Council came into the gates of the city. Highhold's three elven representatives, heads high with what Lanadan knew to be disgust and eyes looking at nothing but he and the Lord of Qeynos...he knew this was not going to be a Council he wished to be overseeing.<br>
Those who had come with both contingents were sheltered within the Guild Halls. Those from Qeynos who had been there during the siege had been asked to return to the homes of their sires, to make room for what was coming and to keep themselves from involvement in the whole matter at hand. One of Lanadan's daughters had made a comment that it was the most quiet she had seen it since she could remember, and he was not to doubt her.<br>
Nearly three quarters of those who normally would have been in the Guild Hall had gone to their respective homes to await the outcome. They were, as always, welcome to witness what was happening, but they had been discreetly asked to not remain in the Guild Hall for anything other than their right to see the Council laying out the Charges and their decision. Those who remained in the Guild Halls were either part of the whole fanfare process, or had not been able to call in enough favors to escape.<br>
Roderick and Tallik had watched Lord Antonanth's entrance into the city from the rampways around the city, both looking to one another with knowing glances. &quot;He'll be a tough nut to crack, Roderick.&quot;<br>
&quot;Sire's done tougher ones than this...though I fear what'll be left in the wake of this. We're already in two corners in Freeport with the Charges they laid against me, and they still haven't openly determined either my guilt or my innocence in those.&quot;<br>
Tallik, walking with the assistance of a walking stick for now until his leg healed, only nodded. The stone he was sitting on was cold, but the look within his general's eyes was colder still.<br>
&quot;You fear he'll strip her of everything she has.&quot;<br>
&quot;My fear is that he'll do worse than strip her of the title she's heiress to...I fear he'll poison things for her within the Guild, as he's already done with me. I can fight back, I've had to...she doesn't know how to, or perhaps doesn't want to.&quot;<br>
&quot;She's tougher than that, Roderick.&quot;<br>
&quot;Maybe,&quot; he replied in an uncertain tone. &quot;Maybe she is.&quot;<br>
Tallik had tapped the end of his walking stick against Roderick's armored shin. &quot;Of course she's made of stronger stuff than that! How could she even be the least attracted to your old scuffed self if she wasn't tough enough to withstand the laughter that brings?&quot;<br>
That brought a glare, and a moment's shared laughter. Roderick said nothing in reply to it, though, his thoughts, and his eyes, looking to the Healers Halls. Lord Antonanth had only been told his daughter was in Qeynos, though where she was had not been divulged. Illiysha's fears for Lady Alamathea's safety were shared by her husband and her sons and daughters, as well as Tallik and, to her surprise, the Necromancer's Circle and the Teir`Dal boy whom she had sequestered within the family wing of the Guild Hall.<br>
It was said her daughters were teaching him all sorts of nasty habits such as reading, writing, Common tongue and shipping schedules and how to dress their dolls in the latest fashions...to which he in turn was teaching them to curse in Teir`Dal seven different ways.<br>
Disgraceful...simply disgraceful.<br>
Lady Illiysha had been there to welcome Lord Narson and Lord Antonanth into the Guild Hall, giving as non-commital a bow as she could without disprespect to her own position and her husband. Lord Narson took to her instantly, warming with a smile to her graciousness.<br>
Lord Antonanth said nothing, coming down from his horse and staring at the Guild Hall in his stony silence. She was once again wearily glad that they had sent Lady Alamathea from the Guild Halls. She feared what would be said between the two now...now that Alamathea had heard the Charges against her Sire, and his actions from them.<br>
It was several hours before those gathered for the Council made their way into the main hall where the trial would be held. Illiysha had caught Roderick's arm briefly, scurrying between the kitchens and the dining hall and warning him to make no appearances until the trial was set to begin and opening Charges laid down before Lord Antonanth. She had been more shocked to learn what he had been doing in the time since he had stared at Lord Antonanth coming through the gates and into the Guild Hall, but there was no time to gather more information from him and she could only scold him with her horrified expression.<br>
Into the main hall they assembled...Lord Narson, Belerak of Kaladim was there also with his small contingent, including his son once again, who had brought Roderick to Freeport and been the one to carry out the original Charges against Lord Lanadan's son.<br>
From Felwithe's ruined spires came Chyrath, Myryn and Brythnyl, all members of the Council there, having been celebrating Chyrath's four hundreth century of life and the marriage of Brythnyl and a young elf maiden. For Brythnyl to have given this consideration over his own feast of wedding and Sire's Birthing Day meant the elves were more agitated over this than anyone had feared at first.<br>
The Outpost had sent three of its own also, one being Vreaa, Guild Knight there who had come to represent his small city for the Charges against Lord Antonanth of Freeport. He had caught Lord Lanadan's ear briefly upon entering Qeynos, stating that if it was permitted due to distances, he might be the first to speak of the matter.<br>
Lord Lanadan seated whom he could personally, though with so many bodies it got to be that chairs were merely given with courtesy and as much respect and small talk as could be for the moment.<br>
Someone rang the bell, calling for attention, and Lord Lanadan took his place atop the small dais and looked to the assembled. He spoke that a Council such as this had not been called in several hundred years, and that the need for it was great. He thanked them for coming distances which normally none would have attempted, and gave credit, once again, to Illiysha's culinary skills and mentioned that if any liked her wares, they might find the recipes in their packs upon leaving the city...but no, she was not leaving to personally prepare them.<br>
The usual laughter at this, and Lanadan could see the tension rising, despite the moment.<br>
&quot;Open the doors and bring in the accused.&quot;<br>
The doors opened, though Lord Antonanth was not to be escorted in the normal fashion to the Council. He was already striding forward in measured steps and came to stop directly at the &quot;edge&quot; of the open circle of familiar faces.<br>
&quot;To believe this is preposterous...to have me here with counter-Charges against this man's son, who did wrong against my daughter, is a greater wrong.&quot;<br>
With that, the Council looked to one another, and began the long process of determining guilt, if any, and what would be done either way.<br>
The list of witnesses was lengthy, given that several cities were involved, though the critical ones were brought in. Shesa was 'ported in briefly to give her own testimony of what she had seen when Roderick arrived with Lady Alamathea and his men, when they had gone out to save Felwithe and the reaction of her own city when her son had been sent out to bring Roderick in for Charges of Abduction.<br>
Daliea was missing still, and her testimony was given in absentia from what people had seen and witnessed matters she had said and done. There was nothing more to do than that, as no one, still, could determine what had happened to her, or where she had gone.<br>
Tallik and the three men had been summoned also to give testimony as to what had happened that night the guard had come from the desert, telling of Lady Alamathea's abduction and the people gathered to search for her whereabouts. Roderick, having simply been there at the moment, had been the one to be pulled for the search at Lord Narson's request.<br>
In spite of the testimony, Lord Antonanth continued to announce his innocence as well as his right to further press Charges, in the name of his daughter, against Lord Lanadan's son. He was often reminded during the trial's first hours that it was he, and not Roderick at this time, who was under suspicion. Roderick's innocence or guilt would be determined in due time, he was assured.<br>
On and on the questioning went. Torches and lanterns and candles by the hundreds were lit to keep the testimony flowing. Refreshments were brought in as the night hours began to take hold of the Council, fidgeting on occasion when the tedious details were sought and Illiysha's delicacies were between preparation and presentation stages.<br>
Sometime near the turn of one day to another, Lord Lanadan called his son into the hall to hear his testimony. He had purposely left Roderick as one of the last to be called, saving Lady Alamathea's voice for one of the last, if not the last, to spare her from the words he feared Lord Antonanth would fall upon her fair head.<br>
Roderick came into the hall with his escort, coming to stand before the open circle of the Council and giving them the bow that was due to them, including another bow to his Sire as was Lanadan's due.<br>
He was questioned from the beginning, as to what had conspired the night that one of his own men had returned to Freeport to announce Lady Alamathea's disappearance. From there to the sands to Lord Antonanth's appearance the following morning and from there to the gnome lands and the castle of shadows.<br>
Questions he was asked he answered freely as he could, those that he was uncertain of he said so, not being able to speak for others who had their own voices.<br>
Testimony was heard, as to what he had done upon reaching the sand, the ruined tents and then what Lord Antonanth had said and done upon his arrival there, and what had the wizard looked like and done? There were trivial questions such as how much sleep had he had the night before it all began, what was he doing that day and wearing, he hoped that they all had a purpose to some safer end than he had walked into the hall with.<br>
For the mood in the room was full of tension, of old hate and ravaging rage. Belerak was full of mistrust for someone who had laid Charges against a man such as Roderick, and he himself had believed them at first, even though he had doubted them. Vreaa, an aged, very old elf of high standing at both the Outpost and in Felwithe, and on occasion in the other Guild Halls, wanted to know the extent of the damage to Felwithe and what the other guilds were going to do about it more than the Charges brought up against Lord Antonanth, although he was also demanding that the man be stripped of all rank, titles and such related things without trial.<br>
Myryn, a younger elf than those assembled on the Council, had been only elected to it the previous spring, and this was his first session...and what would obviously be the first of many, many more, with Felwithe's demise and the need to rebuild. His opinions of the matter were that if Lord Antonanth had done wrong, let it be proven by those who were there, that being Roderick, his daughter and Roderick's men and the unknown being whom they had all encountered in the castle.<br>
Lord Lanadan listened to the squabbles, and in the end, had no choice but to finally send for Lady Alamathea.<br>
The Healers Hall had known that she would be called, and had kept her in seclusion with the two Necromancers guarding her. Of all the people, they were the most impartial to the events presently laid before the Guild. They had nothing to gain, or to lose, if Lord Antonanth was convicted or shown innocent. But their vested interests in seeing the matter to its end were, at least, the most they felt they could do for the Guild Hall now.<br>
They came in a pair, robed from head to toe, but they were not the steady men that Lord Lanadan had been assured would save Lady Alamathea from any harm magickal, spiritual or otherwise.<br>
One entered the Guild Hall in a panic, looking around and moving as quickly as he could near the far tables, pushed against the wall. His face, hood pushed back at last, was whiter than normally was seen on a caster of his following, and Lord Lanadan was not the only one to stand up with interest.<br>
The second entered, backing into the room, pausing only to stare at the person he had bumped into and realizing it was Roderick himself. He looked to Roderick nervously, then said something quickly.<br>
&quot;Braver than my own soul you are for facing him down.&quot;<br>
The Necromancer moved away from Roderick, leaving he and the Council to stare through the doorway.<br>
Lady Alamathea was coming into the room...but not with the escorts Lord Lanadan had provided to her. Led by a wizard, his hair a riot of two colors of youth.<br>
It was only the hand on his shoulder that kept Roderick from slicing the man in two with his sword.<br>
The missing wizard.<br>
But the being behind the wizard, walking just behind Lady Alamathea...<br>
She was walking as if in a trance, looking at nothing and everything, her eyes glazed.<br>
She was in a strange armor, the deep chain links and silvery-blue of the Healers Halls, though how they had gotten something for one such as she so quickly he dared not ask. The wounds on her throat, he noted, were sealed at last.<br>
The being who walked behind her, coming to stand just behind and to the right of her, gave Roderick a charming, delighted smile as he looked around the Council.<br>
To them all, he gave a deep, courteous bow, and then Lady Alamathea turned to him, weary, but showing no fear of him.<br>
He took her hand, kissing it reverently, and then she backed away from him, her eyes more intent on the wizard's closeness than his own. Roderick's move to pull her closer to him was not seen for what it truly was, nor did anyone save perhaps Illiysha ever question it.<br>
Lord Mayong Mistmoore looked with a growing, toothy smile to the Council, and then his eyes rested upon Lord Antonanth.<br>
&quot;So...we have been found out, brother mine. Pity more than our plans did not come to such fruition as we promised one another...but there are matters here that I find myself to be involved in. And it is only fitting that I am a part of them now...as now that the gnomes have been destroyed...Kaladim has a choice to depart its people from the Faydwer and the Mountains of Butcherblock, or to suffer the same fate as the other cities there.&quot;<br>
A chair came to his calling, no hand touching it but a gentle magick. His hair, immaculately pulled back with a single ribbon of a deep red, it fell in a gentle wave along his back, and his eyes were attentive to Lord Lanadan and the others.<br>
&quot;Let us discuss Lord Antonanth's wrongdoing...and my own terms for his release...and my demands.&quot;<br>
Roderick felt his own blood chill several degrees, his ungloved fingers already stroking Lady Alamathea's neck, and knowing, somehow, as long as the beast lived, her wounds would continue and there was no telling what else might befall her.<br>
She was wholly, utterly frightened, he could feel it in her in that she made no move to return his caress against her cheek and hair, her eyes intent on the Lord of Mistmoore, and on the Council.<br>
The eyes of the entire city, it seemed, were now staring at the Guild Hall's unannounced Witness.<br>
Lord Lanadan seated himself slowly, unsteadily, catching Illiysha's look of pure dread to his right against the wall. It was going to be a very, very long night indeed now.<br>
