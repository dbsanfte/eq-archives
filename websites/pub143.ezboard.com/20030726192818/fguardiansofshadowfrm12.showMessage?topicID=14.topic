was all he could manage in a hoarse whisper to throw at her. Her eyes looked up at him, clear but very, very afraid and shook her head. She was pressing back against him, as if he might possibly protect her from the beastly, male figure seated with the wizard behind him, just to the left.<br>
All he could do for her was grip her fingers in his own...there was nothing else he could possibly do.<br>
HOW she had gotten Lord Mistmoore here, without any of the Necomancers knowing, would be settled later. The Necromancer's Circle, having been brought in to assist with some of the information that had been gathered from the Siege of Qeynos, were staring at the lordly man and looking to their two absolutely stunned and frightened brethren...and looking pale themselves. Necromancers feared little but life itself...and here was something beyond life, beyond death in their midst and they, as a one, seemed to realize that they were within its thrall as the others were.<br>
For Lord Lanadan, the shock of seeing Lady Alamathea stride into the hall with the missing wizard had been enough for him to nearly draw the sword he had sworn he would not wear to the proceedings in the Guild Hall. The moment's panic had turned into a cold sweat when the instigator, supposedly, of the entire mess came striding behind the wizard, behind Lady Alamathea, who had obviously brought him at either his behest or her own, into the Guild Hall.<br>
Changes, after this, would most indefinitely be coming to the Guild Hall...of that he could be assured of.<br>
He seated himself, staring at this figure...tall and rather handsome to gaze at, with his deep red eyes and drawn back hair, his clothing immaculate and rather well cut. Lord Lanadan noted that Belerak was especially pale, and Vreaa was trying to seat himself further back in his chair, as if this would put more distance between he and the stranger.<br>
But the voice was, if nothing else, amused and rather polite for such a time. &quot;You have questioned others, and now I sit here before you, waiting for my own stead. What have you to ask of me?&quot;<br>
No one was more startled than the speaker.<br>
&quot;Why have you done this to me? What have I done in return to you to deserve this?&quot;<br>
Roderick was wincing, but he was only holding her hand, not covering her mouth. Perhaps he should have done that instead. But it was too late.<br>
&quot;You still have no possible idea of what you are, my fair one? He,&quot; he said, motioning to her sire standing before him, and standing before the Council. &quot;He is the one who ultimately decided your fate. I asked for a Healer of well-regard, who would join me in darkness and moonlight forever, to keep those who serve me alive...&quot;<br>
To this, he gave a chuckle, and waved off his own joke. &quot;As alive as they can be I suppose...this was the pact that was made. A Healer would be chosen, the strongest that was known of a generation, and to be given to me for my wishes. And when I took Faydwer back for my former lands, as had been taken once from me, she would be beside me, keeping those alive who re-claimed what had been lost to me.<br>
&quot;And, to my dismay, it would have been somewhat the perfect crime in looking back, had one not escaped to tell the tale.&quot;<br>
He was staring at Roderick, to Lady Alamathea's ashen face staring back at him against a background of Roderick's steel breastplate.<br>
&quot;I was asked if I wished anything in return for this...for finding a Healer of great power and knowledge is, ultimately, the study of many, many years worth of doing and musty tomes.<br>
&quot;On occasion...one might be born into such knowledge, and know their duties when the magick comes to them. Rare, and quite unknown until they are Tested properly, but they do happen. It isn't unknown for such people to have no possible idea of their own strength...until they are forced to admit it.<br>
The chair turned slightly, Lord Mistmoore and the wizard staring at Lady Alamathea. &quot;My lovely child...had you not destroyed seventeen of my own, before my own vision, I would not have believed one could possibly exist again...a Healer of strength and of testing, of good and so against an evil they did not, at first, understand.<br>
&quot;But...you do not remember what you did...&quot; He was smiling at her, dark eyes glowing with a frightful fire and Roderick felt her shaking.<br>
&quot;No..it would not do for you to remember being brought from the sands to my realm...seventeen of my best sent to their final graves by one frightful blast of magick and might in a moment of terror.<br>
&quot;Do you know, my lovely child, that you took down more of my servants....and grand total of nearly sixty-three of them to be exact...before I came down to see what was happening in the grand banquet hall? Sixty-three of my own children...gone before I was forced to subdue you myself when they would not go near you.&quot;<br>
Lord Mistmoore was looking to her intently, glowing eyes laughing. &quot;Yes...you were not the easiest to attempt to subdue...but you were, in the end, such a charming sight...immobile and only your eyes looking this way and that. Have you never known such terror before, child? The terror of having nothing to do but feel death upon you and nothing to prevent its calling?<br>
&quot;And having at least brought you to a somewhat manageable juncture, you were brought into the castle and given hospitality...welcomed and left to roam the castle as you wished in your...lost state.&quot; He chuckled again, drier than earlier.<br>
Lord Lanadan caught Illiysha's frantic movements of head and hand, and it was only then that he noted the steel plate on his son's armor was slowly being bent by the force of his fingers, and his rage. Roderick was standing deadly still, his right hand slowly, steadily with growing anger bending the plate back from the chains and strap that had held it for many, many years now.<br>
&quot;You are, fair child, rather a victim of yourself...had your sire perhaps instructed you earlier of what you were, instead of keeping you focused on swordplay...you might, now, be a Healer beyond even the visions of the people you call your own. And our pact ensured that, if one was found, they would not be nurtured...that I would be doing that duty, for there would be an eternity to do so in. What is time to those who watch it pass as if it were blowing sand?&quot;<br>
Vreaa looked rather pale for an elf, and Myryn was also rather quiet despite it all. Lord Lanadan himself had nothing to say...he was afraid to speak at all, lest they miss some part of what had happened.<br>
&quot;So, child, you were left to the Guild to be raised...kept quiet, kept dutifully as a young woman should, but you never quite took to swords, did you, as was hoped? And what light magicks you were allowed to work...they seemed...brief, did they not?&quot;<br>
Lady Alamathea nodded slowly, for her own voice was frozen now it seemed.<br>
&quot;And why do you think this is so? Because were you to know your true potential, I would have been in a rather difficult position when the time came to call upon my pact with your sire...oh yes, make no mistake of this. He came seeking me, many, many years before you were even a possible thought of existence. We have long been allies, and shall probably continue to be so when he is banished from these halls.<br>
&quot;Oh yes, child, for what he has done, he must leave...and you...I fear you have already started a journey from which I must stop you from. Faydwer was mine, and through a series of poorly planned mishaps on my own part, it was lost to me. Now I have returned, to claim what was once, and shall again, be mine.<br>
&quot;To do that, child...I must have you. A pact is a pact, and I have, to date, fulfilled my part of it. I have taken out enemies, former allies, sown discord within the halls you dwell in now with shades and wraiths of people well known and sent people to their deaths.<br>
&quot;My half of it has been sealed...those opposing Lord Antonanth Hopeseeker have been vanquished, slowly through the years, but done so in ways of permanence.<br>
&quot;Upon your honor as Knights, as men of honor and men of skill in sword and some magicks, of the right of a sire to do what they will with a daughter still not of age in their eyes...I demand my payment in this scheme.<br>
&quot;I am owed her.&quot; A slender, somewhat bony finger pointed in the direction of Lady Alamathea. &quot;And I will have her....today, tomorrow, the following moon, four seasons from now...but it shall be done.&quot;<br>
It was more a death sentence than simple fact, Roderick feeling her trembling growing more and more violent as the words rang out in the silence of the hall. He himself knew nothing of what to do about all of this. The revelation that Lord Antonanth, truly, had conspired both against his children, his blood, his comrades and, ultimately, his own Guild, was one piece of the puzzle.<br>
Lord Mayong's quiet tones of demand, however, were something he was not prepared to fulfill.<br>
&quot;I believe we have many matters to discuss then.&quot; Lord Lanadan's voice was hoarse to even himself as he stood slowly.<br>
To his son, he motioned him towards the door. &quot;I believe Lady Alamathea requires other places at the moment other than these halls. See to this.&quot;<br>
It was all he could do to nearly drag her, Tallik beside him with her other arm and between the pair of them, leading her to the doors and, two Necromancers falling in behind them, closing the doors gratefully with a welcome noise.<br>
She was ultimately ashen, saying nothing but her fingers going up constantly to the wounds on her neck. He had a tight grip on her other fingers, forcing her to squeeze back with the pressure he applied.<br>
Tallik was leading them to the Healers Halls, but Roderick shook his head to that. If chaos ran through the Guild Halls, that would be their first place to look.<br>
To the Necromancers, he gave a stern expression. &quot;Tallik, I can't ask you to go where I'm going...&quot;<br>
&quot;Damn your Name if you keep me out of it...&quot;<br>
That was all the promise he received...and he looked to the robed pair.<br>
&quot;She needs to be hidden...and hidden in a place no one would think to look.&quot;<br>
The taller of the pair nodded, having, somewhat, gotten over the shock of seeing Lord Mistmoore. He motioned them down several streets, Roderick knowing the way of old. He himself had been Tested in a very young age as to whether or not he could find the secret passages. He knew of seven in the city leading down into the aquaducts and beyond.<br>
The Necromancer's Circle boasted there were an even total of twenty.<br>
Lady Alamathea made no protest when the magick wall was passed through, stone melting into nothingness and walking through it without fear. Into the other side, there was near blackness, torches lighting the way, but just barely.<br>
Three more Necromancers met them suddenly, bringing glowing orbs of light in their hands and giving one to each of the visitors, and then shuffling down into the darkness.<br>
Roderick followed steadily, never releasing her hand and keeping watch that Tallik, despite his handicapped leg, was keeping up with them. He feared that if they paused, they might not encounter their hosts again for quite some time in their fear to return to their homes for safety.<br>
They came into a central chamber, through a grate of teeth and stone and they had the first well-documented look at the home of the Necromancer's Circle.<br>
Roderick would sort the details of that first look later. His words of inquiry as to a quiet place to sit and sleep were easily seen to, as well as what refreshments they wished.<br>
Despite the location, there was a rather homey feel to the guest room...rather large, with glowing orbs brightening the room upon being commanded to. There were several beds, real beds he noted, as well as a lengthy wall being taken up by books of which he could neither read, nor wished to.<br>
Tallik offered to stand guard outside the room, the two Necromancers from the guild offering him a second room instead, and insisting that the Necromancer's Circle had assured their safety, and would not go back on that promise.<br>
Uneasily, Tallik was seen to another room, if he preferred, leaving Roderick with Lady Alamathea, who was shaking heavily now despite the shadows of the room.<br>
He helped her out of her armor, as he seemed to be doing this quite a lot lately, and wondered what his mother would have thought if she knew what he was doing.<br>
But Lady Alamathea just stood there, raising a hand when it was moved, a leg pushed out a bit, her neck lifted to remove the chain. In nothing more than her tunic of a deep burgundy and the leggins of blue, he was staring at her choice of colors strangely.<br>
&quot;Burgundy to hide blood...blue to hide bruises...&quot; He nearly laughed at her choice, and at the nursery rhyme of old. She was that rattled she had gone back to her own childhood for protection.<br>
He sat down on one of the beds and gathered her into his arms, holding her tightly, her head tucked against his shoulder as best he could. Awkwardly, he finally got his own armor off and brought her back down against him, a quiet moment he wished had not come to pass.<br>
She was a true Healer...why had no one listened to him so long ago?<br>
Now he knew...because anyone who might have listened was either now dead or about to be due to Lord Antonanth's influence. For her, nearly a lifetime's worth of Training had been neglected, and he feared she might never know her true potential now for it.<br>
Lord Mistmoore obviously knew, and he was all for keeping her as she was.<br>
Her eyes had closed, breathing somewhat regular as he set her down to sleep on the bed, taking one of the others to catch up on lost sleep himself, and then thought against it. If someone were going to do something, better to stay together and near her.<br>
He pulled extra blankets off one of the other beds, tucking her into one set, himself into the other, lest Illiysha's horrified expression be worse than he feared it would be. Wrapped as mummies on the bed, they slept, nearly three lengths below the Guild Hall itself, where judgements were being passed, witnesses called again and, ultimately, the fate of the very Guild seemed to be at stake.<br>
Corruption, it seemed as Lord Mistmoore spoke in his soft voice, seemed to be everywhere...there was no city that had not escaped it. Lord Lanadan was learning that even in his trusted halls, there was nothing above a bribery if someone was in needy times.<br>
Yes...Illiysha and Roderick had feared things, but even Lanadan had not seen their star witness being the ultimate cause of most of their trials over the last fifty years.<br>
And what to do about him, ultimately...if there was anything they could possibly do.<br>
