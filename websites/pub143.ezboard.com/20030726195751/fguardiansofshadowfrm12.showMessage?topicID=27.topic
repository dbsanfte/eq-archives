We just did a hard day of walking, Belneth is starting dinner and we are all sitting and waiting for it.  Our new traveler that we meet is named Jaknes, a Wood elf form the East he says. But i know better, they only wood elfs that regin form the east are the ones of Tunare, and they never stray far from home, let alone come all the way out here into the rathe mountians. Another thing is he has asked alot of questions, and i all ways thought wood elfs stayed to them selfs. He got to talking about his home in the trees, and asked Devin about kaladim, Devin replyed &quot; what about that stink hole in the earth&quot;.  I laughed, maybe this elf should know more about our past before he gets to invole with us.<br>
He then asked me about Grobb, right then and their I stood up and drew my sword.  I said, &quot;For a wood elf you sure do ask alot of questions of lands that you know nothing about.&quot;  As my sword was drawn and pointed at the travler, Naiya told me to stop it or she will have my head, as i turned around i saw her, she had drawn her boot dagger and held it pointed bewteen my legs.  I knew it was a joke, but it was her way of telling me to calm down.  I sethed my sword and sat down, glareing at the wood elf.  I said&quot; you wish to know about Grobb?..Well we aren't traveling to night and i havent told this story for some time now, so i will tell my tell again..for your sake atleast.  I said&quot; It all happened when i was little......(Fadeing to black)<br>
<br>
The night air is as thick as the murke water in the swamp.  With the air so thick his torch only lite about 10 feet before him, but he knew his way so well that he could have gotten back to the city with out any light at all.  As the young troll passed the guards leading to his home, one of the guards said&quot; there goes jagsons son, worthless old man, he was never a true warrior.&quot; As the boy walked by, you could see him griting his teeth.  The boy enter the femilar city and went right to his home, which was a one room shack towards the entrence of the city, it was common knowledge that the further back in the city the richer ones family is.  The boy entered the shack to find his father, as always drunk and passed out.  The fire had died down, so the boy threw some more on to stoke it up.  After a night of exploring the swamp, and finding that dead body of a froglok, which no one seemed to search, the boy was happy to have found 3 whole platinum on it, but this got the boy athinking.  Why would a froglok travel so far in the swamp to die? anotherthing is if it had died by a hand of a troll why was their money still on it?<br>
The thought of it puzzled him for some time until he drifted off to sleep.  The next mourning he awoke, but something was differnt, his father wasnt sleeping.  in fact is father wasnt in the house at all, but this didnt worry the boy becuase his father is suspose to be at work early anyways, just amazed he did go to work at all made the boy's day already.<br>
<br>
(Returning to the camp fire) <br>
<br>
Right then and thier Belneth handed me a bowl of soup, and i passed it around the fire, it seems that dinner is ready.  The fellow traveler spoke,&quot; we it seems that your life had a rough start&quot;.  I couldnt help it, I laughed, &quot;Ha Ha, those were the good days.&quot; i then glanced over to Naiya, she had just removed her blood stained armor and was washing the blood off, she saw me looking at her, she said&quot;what trollie, havent seen a Dark elf with out armor on?  I couldnt help it, she was beautiful, she knew it, I knew it, everybody in the camp knew it.  I remarked, no i was just wondering why the cleric has to do more fighting than the warriors?  Right after i said it, I knew i had made a mistake in my words.  She stood up and threw the blood soaked rag at me. she said &quot; I wouldnt have to if you knew how to fight better than a stupid orc.  It seemed i upset her some by telling her how to do her job, i didnt mean to, it just came out that way. After dinner was ate , which no one wanted seconds, and only belneth didnt know the reason for this.  The Travel asked me to contuine.<br>
I then said&quot; Well it wasnt until later that week that....<br>
<br>
(Fade to a Boy sitting on a bar stool)<br>
<br>
&quot;hey Mr.Wanks may i have another?&quot; said the boy. the old bar keep said&quot; Now you listen here  child i dont take stolen money, it is bad enought i took that first plat for the food and dwarven ale, no get out!!&quot; The boy left the bar and steped out side, and looked at the night sky. he then saw a small smoke stack in the west, it is just probley the fire of some hunters, that got lost and cant find their way home.  right then and their a speed horse came running thru town and headed to the kings area, The horse was black with a rider that couldnt have been more than 2 feet tall. It was stange becuase the guards let him right by.  The  Boy then grabed his back pack and sword, and headed towards the gates of the city, to search the swamp again.  As he left his house he had seen his father stumpling his way towards thier shack. They boy hurried off, so his father wouldnt see him.  As he past the gate he saw the fire again, this time it was coming closer to the city, the boy thought great they hunters are coming home, which means freash meat tomarrow.  As the boy lite is Torch and took of east in search of more Traeasure he again didnt think twice about the smoake and fire in the west.  It wasnt until several hours later that while he was cooking a peice of rabit, that suddenly a Frogman jumped over and kicked the stick tha was holding the meat by the fiire. with out the boys knowledge he grabed a large peice of wood and swung with all his might against the frogman's cheast. WACK. The peice of wood broke right in the middle. It had nocked the frog man onto his side. With the rage that was in the boy he jumped ontop of the frogman and started to jab the peice of wood into the fleshy part of the mans stomach. Blood squirted out of the man and all over the boy. It suddenly stoped breathing, the boy takeing no chances stabed the stick inside the frog and twisted it. The frogman didnt even twich. The boy took the frogmans armor, and grabed his sword and backpack. he ran towards the town to tell everyone about what had just happend.  As he ran he say the smoake stack, it had made it to the town, but now their is dozens of smaller smoke comeing out of the city. it was as if all the houses are on fire! He ran as fast as he could, he saw some other trolls carrying bags and in carts traveling in a path towards the great desrert.  he asked&quot; What in Rallos's name has happend to the city?&quot; Before anyone could answer him he was lifted up onto a horse, the same black horse that ran past him by the bar.  the boy didnt get to see the face, but it was a man and he said&quot; hold on tight if you want to live&quot; And with that the boy hugged the man for dear life, and he knew life as he knows it has changed....<br>
<br>
(Fade back to the camp)<br>
<br>
The traveler says&quot; Well i never knew such a thing happened to grobb.&quot;  As i stood up and turned for my tent i stated&quot; tomarrow i will tell the rest as we ride towards The Plains of Karana.&quot;<br>

If anything you seemed a bit rushed to get through the story so I had a hard time making the different transitions. If you didnt allready read your work to yourself out-loud, it helps me to proof-read my work, and add new things to it. <br>
The idea is there and its a good one, but you need elaborate more in your explanations. Yeah, my only complaint is that it moved too fast. <br>
But, you definitely have the imagination to be a writer, IHO.<br>
<br>
P.S. This is of course, meant to be gently so please do not let it in any way discourage or offend.<br>
