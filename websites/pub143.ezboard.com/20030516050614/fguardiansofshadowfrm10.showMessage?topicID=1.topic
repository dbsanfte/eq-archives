We encourage you to browse through our website, as well as review the list of rules we have below. Please contact any of us in game if you have further questions or would like to come join one of our coming raids or events.<br>
<br>
<br>
1) Have Fun - We are here to have fun. When you click &quot;ACCEPT&quot; on the login screen, you are leaving &quot;real life&quot; behind to begin an adventure into the game called Ever Quest. It is a game, it is for enjoyment, and above all, it is a place to have fun with yourself and your allies and friends. Please always realize that this, above all the other considerations, is our number one goal. Whether you roleplay being the drunkard from Qeynos or the mysterious lizard creeping in the shadows with a staff, we are here to game, to enjoy, and to have fun.<br>
<br>
2) Membership - There are no level, race, or class restrictions for people to be considered into the guild ranks. All new members will be on a two-week trial basis and during this time may be removed for a valid reason. During that two-week time all new members are encouraged to consult the guild website, join with raids and other groupings, and get to know the fellow guildies around them.<br>
If a member is to be removed during the two-week time frame, the officer or guildmaster must provide the following: 1) Screenshot of the incident and all witnesses involved in it, zone, date, time, and what happened AND/OR 2) Logged conversation(s) of the incident if not in the same zone. If, after this, a resolution still has not been reached, other options will be explored.<br>
<br>
3) Participation - Members are encouraged to participate in all guild happenings. This includes, but is not limited to, website forums, raids, and guild chat. Suggestions are encouraged from all members, as we all play differently and many times a new idea gives new light to an old problem.<br>
<br>
4) Anonymous - We encourage all people to participate in the guild, and by doing so, each person has a guildtag to show membership to our ranks. Those who go above this tend to roleplay, and roleplaying, with a purple tag, is also acceptable. However, being anonymous, with a guildtag, is not something we encourage people to do. Unless you have been instructed to do so by a GM/Verant Employee, which does happen on occasion due to incidents, being anonymous with a guildtag is not acceptable. You will probably be asked if someone sees you in guildchat, but up on doing a /who of the guild does not see you. Please be considerate to this.<br>
<br>
5) Guild Website - We ask that all members please register themselves on the guild website, as this is, outside of game, the first place a guildmember should be looking for information on what's happening. Posts from items for trade/sale to the next guild raid to someone's next level to &quot;a funny thing happened to me today on the way to the forum&quot; are there, as well as updates on officer's meetings and patch information. It is the responsibility of all guildmembers to know what is happening if it is posted on the guild website. There is nothing more embarrassing than logging onto the game and seeing there is a raid already in progress, for your levels, and something drops you wish you had been there to roll on.<br>
<br>
6) Guild MOTD -  Guild Message of the Day is the yellow message you see, sometimes beneath a server-wide message from the server GM. It posts what is happening today, either raid-wise or other information, as well as information that guildies may need to know quickly.<br>
<br>
7) Internal Guild Problems - Sometimes, people have a bad day, a bad raid, someone's mother-in-law has arrived and the boss gave you a pink slip. Things happen, it happens to all of us and sometimes we screw up. We say something that, to us, was meant in a lighter tone than perhaps it was spoken, or we looted something on a wrong corpse. We are human...but we are also responsible for our actions and must be aware of it. Problems that happen on guild raids, in guildchat, as well as in other matters will be addressed as they arise. If the people/group cannot work it out themselves, an officer or the guildmaster will get involved and make a judgement on the evidence of both sides.<br>
