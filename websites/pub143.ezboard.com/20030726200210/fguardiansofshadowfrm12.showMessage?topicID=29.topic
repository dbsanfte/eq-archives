<br>
It was to no one’s great surprise when scrolls were received by the Lord of Freeport, on behalf of the Elder Council of Neriak, that he was to turn over several of “their own” for trial of Justice. Tallik, Pequil and Waylar listened to the scrolls being read by the Lord of Freeport’s personal scribe, who had hand-received and delivered them, the three trying to determine what leverage this was intended to give the Teir`Dal, and none could be found other than pure malice perhaps, revenge for the past.<br>
As Tallik was, to the most sense, in charge of the city’s Knights above-ground, he stated, for the recordkeeper’s benefit, that the people listed were neither under his charge nor did he associate with “inkies”...that word placed on the record in place of the other epithet he had mentioned when speaking of them.<br>
For Waylar, he looked at the scroll, shaking his head also. “I’ve never heard of these individuals, have you, Pequil?”<br>
Having spent most of her life outside of the city of Neriak, with a name given to her by humans, she looked at the name she had been born with, flowing with the harsh click of the tongue at the end, and shook her head. “I’ve not seen this person in many, many seasons. She is probably dead by now. And these others, no one with those names was with us, save Barak, whom they’ve not named at all.”<br>
The returning scrolls began a war of words, that Freeport was harboring Teir`Dal, to which the Lord of Freeport explicitly stated the Teir`Dal mentioned were no where in HIS city...a matter of quibbling as what lay below the cobblestones of the main town was truly not under his jurisdiction, but under Waylar’s and the Elder Council. If there were any known Teir`Dal in the city, given what had happened in Faydwer and Qeynos, they would certainly have been taken to the gallows long ago. On and on it went for several months afterwards.<br>
When the Lord of Freeport’s main scribe became ill, and replacements sought during his time in bed, Barak and Gretta were listening to Waylar’s own scrolls from the city of Neriak, demanding the return of their own for trial and death.<br>
To no one’s surprise, they wanted Pequil and Barak desperately, for both held secrets that, now known to be alive, could damage the city proper...or so the Teir`Dal believed. Pequil gave a dry laugh in that if everything she knew about the city was told, why had no one invaded it as yet to exterminate them once and for all?<br>
Firatha was also called in, as her name was on the list, at the bottom of it, as her folk in Neriak were not of any ruling court, but they were well-known anyway. She stood listening to the charges, brought up against Barak’s men, listening to the droning words, and then to the charges against her. They were rather lengthy, mostly for time invested and stating betrayal that she was not a healer and they had been lead to believe she was. Arton’s laughter behind her had supported her, and Kerlin’s fingers wrapped in her robes helped to soothe her fears.<br>
They had been the ones to keep her sanity during the words, when her sires finally realized she was alive somewhere, and not a healer, but a Necromancer of some future skill, and they wanted her back now. Necromancers were of the highest regard in Neriak, the truest of killers, and to have produced one would bring them great honor.<br>
She found herself smiling also for some rather strange reason. They wanted her back now, when they had done nothing to either train or help or understand her. Now that they knew she had come into come of her magick, they were demanding her return to them for honor. Waylar had explained a very long time ago that Necromancers, as all casters did, came into the powers through time, and with time, were deadlier than perhaps even Barak with his swords, for they did not need to be face to face with their victims.<br>
The scrolls demanded a reply, and Waylar left it to those assembled, one by one, to give their recorded statements that would be delivered to Neriak.<br>
Barak’s men, one by one, stated they would not return. They acknowledged they were now under death and had made that choice by leaving many cycles ago with the Grand Master Knight. None of them made mention of their true sires, but one, the tallest of the four, Firatha still believed she recognized, and was rather appaled to learn that he was, in some respect, a distant brother to Pequil and of that same Bloodline...the third oldest Bloodline in Neriak that had never been broken or tarnished.<br>
Barak stated he would not return, for he had been gone enough time that another Grand Master Knight would be chosen with time. He had other duties to attend to, his wife and his remaining children, and stated in clipped tones that his ties with Neriak and anyone there had been severed with his leaving cycles before. There were none there now who were worthy of his time or words. The finality of it brought Gretta to tears, she having not been near the volcano, but having questioned enough people to know what her daughter had done. She, as had Waylar, had been warned of the customs of Teir`Dal, but to finally see one of them in use with her own child was something she and Barak were still at an impasse over.<br>
Pequil made no demands, nothing to condemn, save that she was no longer Teir`Dal, she was something more after so many cycles in association with humans and other races. That she asked only to be left alone to live out what remained of her life with her human husband and their children probably was more of a slap to whomever read the scroll for her sires than she could have cursed at them. Her voice never wavered, for after so long a time, she had nothing to return to save a quick death, and she was not about to leave her grandchildren without their matron.<br>
Firatha was also asked to make her statement, looking about at all the more famous people around her, to Waylar and Pequil sitting in their chairs, Barak and his men standing and refusing seats, though Gretta was seated, but all noted not near her husband. It was something they would have to work out on their own, most were whispering to themselves. But such things sometimes damaged a relationship to the point of destruction; no one was certain where this would lead them both.<br>
“What do you wish to say, Firatha? These will be your sires we’ll be sending this to, though naturally everyone will know due to the multitude of hands who’ll be reading it along the way to the Council.”<br>
What to say? What to say to the people who had mocked, beaten, mercilessly demanded she do as they asked without falter, even if it had not been something she had been able to do? And now that she was not something they had expected, and alive, she was worthy of them, worthy to return to the darkness and the stench of hate and the lust of death. What to say?<br>
Kerlin was restless in her lap, up and down during the entire happenings despite going from person to person wanting to know what they were doing, even if they had been asked four times before. His little hands in her robes still charmed her.<br>
She gave a tiny shrug and did not know what to say, only that she wanted to be alone and live as long as she could because there was nothing to go back to but a life she was no longer part of.<br>
Arton gave her hand a squeeze of reassurance, and she found herself returning it without knowing why.<br>
The scrolls were sent back to Neriak with the replies from each person, and life began, somewhat, to take on some semblance of normalcy again.<br>
Barak often was seen in the tunnels training at strange hours, sparring with himself or anyone who wanted to test their strength. There were rumors that he had not been to the restaurant in some time, and that Gretta was leaving much of the duty of running the establishment to the remaining children and her few reliable women. Pequil was often seen there now, perhaps to try to soothe matters as best she could.<br>
For Chiral, Firatha’s return to the nursery was nothing more than miraculous with two of her assistants out with the sniffles and the usual handful of children who needed tending to. The little hands that grabbed at her robes, for she had taken to wearing them constantly now, if for nothing more than to have them as soft as Pequil’s one day. That was something she wanted desperately, to have them as soft and welcome as Pequil’s were.<br>
The irony of the situation came to light when Waylar asked her, nearly a month afterwards, to come with him without warning. That he was in his own formal robes did not set off any warnings in Firatha’s mind, though Chiral had given him a rather formal nod as he took Firatha out of the nursery.<br>
She was blindfolded and led down the halls, though with her sense of scent she knew she was being lead towards the training areas. But that she was kept blindfolded was more the surprise when she was left to stand alone, Waylar leaving her in a rustle of robes.<br>
From her left came the first voice, one not known to her, and very old. The question was a rather simple one, but immediately upon answering, another was thrown at her from her right, and then another from behind, again to her left...on and on and on this went for quite some time, until someone threw the first spell at her.<br>
Blind, but sensing the danger, her own counter-spell was flaring before she could think of why she had chosen it. Another spell, another heartbeat where she called on the magick without question and let herself defend herself as she had not done as yet. Her sparrings with Arton were nothing less than childs play to what was happening. She felt herself sweating, felt the strain of spellcasting and the weariness of mind that comes from studying and having to put all that study to the ultimate test of survival against others.<br>
When it stopped, she was gasping for air into her strained lungs, poisons clinging to her robes and magick steaming from her fingers it seemed. The blindfold was removed with great dignity by gentle hands, those of a man older than even Waylar, and his wrinkled, soft skin was a caress against her own.<br>
The loose circle of Necromancers were none she had met before, but they were very old. Magick from them was heavy in the room, mingled with her own smaller presence from casting. She did not know if it was proper to ask what was happening, and Waylar was there just outside what she noted was a circle of candles. Somehow, she sensed that her magick had not gone beyond the circle, though she knew it was powerful, as well as with time she would be able to do things Waylar had often spoken of.<br>
The one who had removed her blindfold stepped forward, a very strange book in his hands, and she noted that his hands were heavily gloved while touching it. “Place your hand on the book, child, flat, and whisper your Name to us.”<br>
She was afraid now, the book was singing to her, but it was not an unkind song, and she did as she was instructed, laying her hand flat on the cover of the book and giving a cry when it seized her skin as if glued. She tried to pull back but there was no escape from it, and her spells were gone, her mind blank for a moment, the panic that she had been betrayed rushing up through her as nothing had before since her capture.<br>
And then it was gone...and her hand was free.<br>
The book now had the print of her hand upon its cover, seared on by magick and her Name, and it was extended to her. “Open it, child, and you will find something waiting for you there.”<br>
She did, finding such a thick tome to be rather light in her hands, some small part of her mind realizing that the book was now hers, none other would be able to open it, hence the Elder’s gloved hands. And, indeed, there was something waiting for her within the first pages of the book.<br>
It was glowing, alive and chattering to her with a language of magick she had not heard before. She wanted to touch it, and did so, startled when the glowing thing on the page leapt out at her and she nearly stumbled...<br>
...Watching it secure itself as her first sigil of rank, to just below her chin on the left hem of her robe. The robes felt less heavy on her, and she might have been imagining it in her exhaustion, but they felt...softer? Less as they had been, but so much more? Was it possible?<br>
The Elder bowed to her, as did the others, and the candles behind each of them were extinguished and the circle brought down. “We welcome you to our Ranks, Firatha. Welcome, little banshee,” he said with a chuckle.<br>
The book was now nearly lightweight in her hands, and she found Waylar and Arton watching her just behind one of the Elders. The father was smiling at her with welcome and great pleasure that she had passed. The son was staring at her another way, something she often times saw Chiral doing when Drathyl was near, or being spoken of. She did not understand it, but perhaps, with time, she might. And the sigil on her robe was humming to her as an old dog would after a long absence.<br>
Waylar took her shoulder with his hand and led her from the circle. “Come, Firatha, Gretta’s nearly outdone herself preparing a feast for this occasion, and she’s bringing the children here for a while to celebrate with you.”<br>
“Salad?” It was off her lips before she could stop it, to her ultimate shock of being with so many greater Necromancers than herself, and she felt her face lightening with embarrassment.<br>
Arton gave her hair a kiss and laughed at her, as were the others chuckling. “More salad than you can eat at one time, Mouse. Even you.”<br>
