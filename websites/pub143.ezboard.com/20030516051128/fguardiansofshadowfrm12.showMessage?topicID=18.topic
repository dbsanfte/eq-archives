Tiabrin and Illiysha had been waiting for them in Qeynos, how, Roderick never did learn, nor had he wanted to know. A wizard had been brought from Felwithe to ‘port them back to Qeynos and the Healers Halls, and Illiysha had been waiting with several of them.<br>
Her first look at the young woman had been a widening of eyes and a gasp of horror, thinking her dead and brought back for burial, but she had known that Lady Alamathea was alive. The Healers Hall would not have been called in for a burial, even for one of its own at the moment, and the faint heartbeat that she and the other Healers found was simply that...a life holding onto a fragile strand.<br>
Roderick would not let her out of his arms until they reached the Healers Halls, and then Tiabrin was only allowed to assist him in setting her on one of the tables. To his shock, the young Teir`Dal was also there, scurrying as the pages had done in the Library, and Tiabrin had nearly slapped him when he demanded what the lad was doing there.<br>
“They say he has potential here, Roderick, leave off and pay attention to Alamathea. That IS why you’re here, isn’t it?”<br>
The Healers had been brought in from Erudin and the Outpost, from Kaladim and Highhold and from the far off lands of the Coldain, who knew ancient lore that might hold a key to something. The eldest of them had, strangely enough, sought out the Necromancers again, calling on the same Elder Waylar that had spoken to Roderick for advice.<br>
He himself had had little to add. “Near death...not enough life left in her to save, unless one truly must have her pulled back from such a state.”<br>
“Can she be saved?”<br>
His ageless eyes had met Roderick’s, and then looked down to the death grip he was holding on Lady Alamathea’s hand. “Brought back, yes, with a resurrection of soul from the body, and then returned...but what’s going to be left when the soul is brought back to the body?”<br>
“If she’s not the same, she’ll be the one to judge, and it will be her decision what to do...death or life. But give her the chance.”<br>
Waylar had looked to the Healers, to Illiysha and to Lanadan and then to Roderick himself. “You understand her soul must bind itself to another’s to be done?”<br>
He nodded; he knew the ancient tales, the spell that could not be done, but all knew how. By his very asking of it, Roderick knew he would be Banished, and he cared not.<br>
“You understand that what returns may have no knowledge of you, of what has happened, of what any of us are or have been to it?”<br>
Roderick’s bloodshot eyes had only looked to Waylar with confidence. “If her soul comes back and there’s nothing left but a clean slate, better to nurture it that way, then to leave it as it was, wasted opportunities from birth because of greed.”<br>
“And if what returns looks up at you, and sees nothing it remembers...or you?”<br>
“Then at least she has the chance to live again,” he had replied, eyes confident still. “Wasted time seems to be all that I’ve got lately...but if she can live again, perhaps she might bring joy to another if she doesn’t recognize me.”<br>
Scrolls were sent out, the greatest Healers being called for the Resurrection, the greatest of magicks that could be done to a being, and the most deadly. They came, hand-picked, from Erudin with Gynath’s blessings, from the Coldain who had heard word of the tale and sent their own within a night’s ‘port, from Qeynos’ own Healers Halls, from Highhold and the Outpost itself.<br>
Roderick never left Alamathea, keeping her hand tightly in his, as if somehow to let it go would release what he was trying to save.<br>
The wounds on her neck, they all feared, might never heal. Lord Mistmoore, bound though he was, was still alive in a sense of the word, and they had never healed while she had been away from him. The concern that they might, somehow, break the bindings was another matter, but the mighty spell took them all away for now. One matter at a time.<br>
A day after their return to Qeynos, when men were still being brought back from Faydwer in groups via the ‘ports, Roderick was in the Healers Halls sitting beside Alamathea on her table, breathing faintly.<br>
It was never determined just whom put the herbs in the drink that was finally passed to him to make him sleep, though no less than five people tried to take the blame on their shoulders proudly, and another dozen wishing they had been the ones to think of it first. He had been staring at her one moment, his head crashing against the table the next in sleep and the cup spilling over Alamathea, the herbal aroma at least a break from the magicks being worked slowly with the gathering of so many Healers.<br>
Roderick woke nearly a day after being drugged into sleep, finding himself on a small cot in front of the gathering hall of the Guild, instead of the Healers Halls. Illiysha had been there to soothe, or at least, attempt to soothe his anger, and even a near slap on the face had not dulled his rage at them having put him to sleep.<br>
“You needed it, Roderick, and she’s been moved here. It’s not safe to do this in Freeport, though we all know it’d be better done there because she’s familiar with it.”<br>
“They’re casting...”<br>
“They’re raising the circles now, Roderick. You can’t go in there, none of us can, because the faintest touch of anything else in that room will destroy what they’ve worked for. They have to Call her Soul, and determine if there’s anything even left for them to Call...and work from there.” She had pushed his hair back, as she often did Lanadan’s in the same lock that fell in the eyes of father and son. “Roderick, you had to sleep, and there’s nothing more you can do for her now but hope, and pray.”<br>
“I shall.”<br>
“And I hope you realize what she might come back as...”<br>
He nodded to his mother, knowing the tales. The spell was a great one, one of the handful that were done only in dire need...he himself probably would have been denied asking for it, had the circumstances not been what they were. Even years later he still could not get a full answer as to whom had approved doing it and why they had bothered.<br>
The barred doors to the gathering hall were guarded by no less faces than Tallik and Chathal, who refused anyone near a ten foot radius of the doors, even Roderick. Illiysha had taken his arm and stated he was fit to walk on his own feet, and she had taken him to stare at the barred doors, to Tallik and Chathal and then she had taken him to the chapel to share a prayer with him to the Highers that something positive might come of the spell.<br>
Of Tiabrin, she herself was inside the room, though Tallik would not comment on the matter. Illiysha knew something, but was not speaking, and Lanadan and the gaggle of geese that were his daughters came to the chapel to find his son and his wife, and to pray quietly.<br>
Roderick remembered nothing of the chapel but the last time he had seen her, the morning she had vanished, dining quietly with the flower in its tiny vase. The little things that he remembered of her doing...pushing her food around her plate so that nothing touched anything else, insisting that there was tea for him, when he had wanted something stronger, and laughing when it always went untouched. The way she had been looking at his fingers for some odd reason and blushing when she had been caught doing so, and, as always, he lovely voice thanking him, but never saying for what, even though he knew why.<br>
The agony of his day’s sleep was nothing compared to his waking moments, as what he had believed would be instantaneous turned into an hour, then two, then half a day, a day fully and then into two. Chathal was given rest by none other that Lanadan himself taking the man’s post, and Illiysha doing the same for Tallik. Roderick was more startled that they were taking such honors, and he was left in charge of his sisters in their absence.<br>
He was starting to remember why he had gone to Freeport in the first place, but they kept him occupied. His brothers had also come to assist with the overabundant young ones, bringing their own children and spouses and filling the family quarters with more laughter than seemed to be in the city these days.<br>
The Lord of Qeynos knew what was happening in the Healers Halls, knew whom was the object of the spell and had been informed that Lord Lanadan would not speak to anyone until the spell was completed. He had sent one of his own Major Domo to look after Roderick and his siblings in the absence of Illiysha, an unheard-of action that brought more than one nod of approval, even from Vreaa. The hardened Outpost Guild Knight had come with his mate of many seasons, coming to offer his aid, if any might be given, to the spell, and finding it already in progress behind barred doors.<br>
Vreaa offered to take a posting in front of the doors, as did Shesa, come from Kaladim at last and having been late, and sadly not part of the spell, but coming to tell Roderick of the wounded in Kaladim who would soon be returning to their homes in Felwithe. Most were well beyond the point of remaining in the Healers Halls of Kaladim and wished to return, and only a handful were still being treated there now.<br>
He noted, in passing, that in Lord Lanadan’s absence, the entire Guild was coming to him for advice, and for instructions. Not that he truly needed to choose which meals would be served, or which Knights would be going out on journeys or which squires might be ready to be Tested and so forth, but it was the busy-ness that was keeping him occupied. Forcing him to think of other things but the barred doors down the halls from where he was in the Guild’s library.<br>
Lanadan, when not sleeping or assisting with the guarding of the spell, was also asking advice of his son in a fellowship way, asking his opinion of matters as the third and finally fourth day of the spell crept over them in dread slowness. Roderick was forced to speak of matters he wished no part of, and yet, they kept him focused on other things than simply staring at the barred doors, to those who had been entrusted to guard it, and, to his everlasing surprise, to his own battalion from Freeport coming to put a twenty foot barrier of themselves, barring all living things from nearing the doors, never mind that Chathal and Illiysha were guarding it on their shift duty.<br>
Roderick was no less startled, on the fourth day, to find his sire laughing at him, patting his knee as if he were five again. “You realize, this waiting is something men must do at least once in their lives, though the outcome is normally greater than this.”<br>
He had raised an eyebrow to that, and Lanadan had chuckled. “You are familiar with men waiting for their children to be born, pacing the halls with blank looks on their faces trying to be caught in conversations and saying nothing of substance? And when are you going to make the union official, so that I can finally send out the scrolls? There may be cousins of hers still alive in Freeport, and there is still the matter of monies owed to her from there.”<br>
It had been a startling thing, something a man spoke to another man, a father to a son, and Roderick had felt something stranger than normal from it. It was as if some part of him had come into manhood, once again, but something greater than he had been before.<br>
He could only give his father, his sire and his Guild Knight, a look of blankness, to which Lanadan had laughed and gone onto the next squire’s duties for the day.<br>
Five days moved to six, and he wondered if they might be sleeping at all behind the barred doors. The tension was beginning to wear on the Guild, even the conversations were lacking the strength they had earlier, and he felt the pressures beginning to build as no word, nothing, not a single breath of news came from the room. Even Lanadan was falling back on Duty and Honor, having nothing else but the daily routine to keep him occupied, and even then having to give some of it to Roderick to keep him busy was wearing.<br>
Six days, seven...a full week went into nine days, ten...<br>
Illiysha finally determined that enough was enough and called for a festival, the Lady of Qeynos demanding the same and the markets were opened fully as if it were some festive day, banners brought up and children told to go find themselves some sweets and something fun to play with. The Guild kitchens were ablaze with color, smells and tantalizing delights for one and all, and Illiysha made certain that there would be two days, not just one, of stuffed stomachs and entertainment. She was in charge, as always, of the food, and the Lady of Qeynos dug into her own resources and brought out the troupes of street magicians, dancers, anyone who might bring some light to the city once again for a brief time.<br>
Roderick was sent into the city with his younger sisters, finding himself having no time to think of the events in the Guild Hall due to he was in charge of seven young women, who were all thinking of different matters and did so and so hear about him? And was he going to be there? And look at the gown over there, with all the lace? And was that the smell of fresh pudding? And maybe some rolls?<br>
Keeping them all in sight was probably one of the greatest feats he could later claim he did, for they were all wanting to go in seven directions at once. And help his eyes but the Lady of Qeynos had sent out her own gaggle of gigglers to meet Illiysha’s brood and the seventeen of them were all laughing and going this way and that, and two nannies and Roderick were hard pressed to keep certain that they were all there and no one ended up in the water somewhere.<br>
Tallik had found Roderick near the end of the first day’s festivities, adding his own authority to keep the girls and young boys in line, though even he had been exhausted come the end when the two groups had been led back to the Lord’s living quarters, at his request, for them to all dine there. It had been more of an honor than Roderick could have refused, having spent the majority of the day holding slices of pie, animals sewn of cloth won at games and more spools of ribbon than he had ever thought possible.<br>
Qeynos’ Lady had provided he and Tallik a chamber and a groom to dress themselves, only giving a knowing grin when Roderick had stammered he was unfit to dine with the Lord in his present attire. He had been caught, he knew it, but the dinner had been pleasant, the tables for the children echoing with the day’s events and the adults speaking quietly of simple matters, as always, coming back to Roderick and Tallik and what had truly happened in Faydwer.<br>
They had been put in guest quarters for the night, the Lady of Qeynos taking nothing for an excuse and putting all of Roderick’s sisters up as well, Tallik having a space of his own as well. The morning brought some respite, despite his staring most of the night out the window at the Guild Halls across the city, and finally sleep taking him as he sat in his chair. The girls were up long before he felt was a respectable hour, but they seemed not to care in the least and he and Tallik were out into the city again with they and the Lord’s children, and the two suffering nannies, back into the amusement of the day.<br>
Illiysha was reigning in some of the baking in the Guild Hall when they finally returned there that evening, the Lord’s children scampering into the kitchen with her own younglings and all receiving a rather gracious kiss on the hair and each got a sweet before the evening meal. Somehow she had been expecting them all, to no one’s surprise it seemed other than Roderick and Tallik, and told them to all wash up and meet in the family quarters for a meal.<br>
Tallik had gone up to Illiysha, coated with sugar and remnants of soup and dough and given her a kiss on the cheek, stating that if Tiabrin might not mind, there might be a daughter he could pick out. That brought a laugh from them both, Roderick giving a grin and knowing Tiabrin too well. She had shooed them from the kitchen, giving a final kiss to Roderick’s cheek and turning him away from the hearths and towards the door. “Mind they eat their greens, too.”<br>
“Yes, Mother,” had been his dour reply.<br>
Two days with them, however, had brought a third when the nannies were taking them again from his care, and he found that he missed them. The squires were suddenly brought to his attention, lacking some formal training that only he knew, though he was well aware that his Sire kept well-trained men in the Guild Hall to teach the younger ones.<br>
In hindsight, it was all well done, and he could never have possibly put enough names to the people who conspired to keep his mind off the barred doors.<br>
Vreaa and Belerak cornered him on the twelfth day, asking what he knew of some Guild matters in Freeport that seemed to be coming to light, and if he might wish to accompany them down there, in the name of Lady Alamathea, to see what was happening. Tallik was only too gleefully glad to return to Freeport in such a manner, and Roderick himself was welcoming the chance to get some of his own back. The Charges against him for Abduction were, still, to be debated at some point in time, though it seemed that in the absence of Antonanth Hopeseeker, missing, and the wizard who had taken them from Freeport to Qeynos, also missing, and one Lord Mayong Mistmoore, currently unavailable to speak to anyone, Roderick found himself the sole voice for Lady Alamathea Hopeseeker of Freeport and her missing wealth.<br>
Lord Narson was well in his element in his city, however, the rumors were circling about himself also and his association with Antonanth, as well as his demands and the missing monies, which, as Guild Knight, since they had gone missing, they were ultimately his responsibility. Vreaa was an elven man, with the gift of long life and many seasons to reflect upon his actions, but he also found that he and Belerak had many, many things known about Lord Narson when they spoke to him in private in the man’s study. Roderick and Tallik listened with interested ears, the conversation going from light banter to the moment at hand to Vreaa bringing up the strange matter of Lord Narson’s first wife who had died under strange circumstances years earlier, the full investigation never having found any true wrong but there had been suspicion for quite some time.<br>
The monies that were owed to Lady Alamathea Hopeseeker were, strangely enough, found in Lord Narson’s own holdings, many of the old paintings and brass works strangely put there “for safe keeping” no doubt, they all looked to one another with mock seriousness. Roderick agreed that they had been put there “for safe keeping” also, but also spoke that they might be better on display elsewhere before someone in Lord Narson’s household might mistakenly sell them as his own.<br>
Roderick and Tallik had known the Hopeseekers had been wealthy, but the total amassed through Antonanth’s years had been startling, and Roderick feared where it had all come from. In the end, Vreaa called on some of his own wizards from the Outpost to take the bulk of it there for safety, for he himself remembered certain items missing from the collection, as well as noting that there was no possible way Antonanth could have come into it by good means.<br>
Lady Alamathea would be quite a wealthy woman...when she woke to discover that the majority of her monies had been taken to the Outpost and put into the bank there for safe keeping, the bulk of the items kept there, also, for safe keeping, and that the lands that had been stripped from Antonanth upon his Banishment were, somehow, back in her name and awaiting her hand to guide their movements.<br>
Belerak was only grinning from ear to ear when they left Freeport four days later for the return to Qeynos, and if Vreaa’s mention that there would soon be a Guild Council to Name Lord Narson’s successor was no premonition, Roderick felt that it would be very soon. Corruption was destroying Freeport’s Guild, and there had to be a way to stop it before it consumed those who had not been in service to Antonanth and his schemes.<br>
Vreaa spoke to Lanadan and they both sent representatives, along with Chathal’s own, to Freeport to begin hand sifting through the Guild there and weeding out those who had been touched and were no longer fit to be Knights.<br>
Seventeen days turned to eighteen, and Roderick found himself in the Guild Hall, dining once again with his parents and his siblings, his brothers wives and their children all cordial, Tallik being pulled into the fold simpy for another single male to speak to and joke with. The Lord of Qeynos had also insisted that the family dine with them the following evening, to speak of matters that could no longer be put off, and Roderick dared not guess, for there was too much going on.<br>
Chathal had all but broken down the door to the Peacekeeper family dwellings, looking around the room and panting, having run the entire way through the Guild Hall to find them. “Roderick, they’re opening the doors, you have to come...”<br>
He had pitied the squires who had had to clean up the frenzy of overturned food and broken dining ware after Chathal’s announcement. It seemed the entire room had come as one entity from the dining area to the barred doors, and the Lord and Lady of Qeynos were there also, waiting as the city had been to discover what had happened.<br>
Waylar was the one to open the doors, to Roderick’s surprise, for he had not known the Necromancers would have been allowed within for the spell. The Elder Necromancer had looked at the nearly hundred strong staring at him as he pulled the doors inward, the bars having been removed at the request from within.<br>
“We seek Roderick Peacekeeper of Qeynos, Knight of Duty and Honor.”<br>
“I’m here,” he had said, pushing through the crowd and stand, ringed by some of his own Knights from Freeport and his family behind him.<br>
The Elder’s hand lifted, open and his eyes concerned. “You have been summoned into this room for Witness.”<br>
Roderick paled...and he felt Illiysha’s defeat before he heard Tallik’s gasp, Chathal’s groan of doom to his left. Belerak had been on duty with Chathal, and Vreaa was closing his eyes slowly with the pain of loss.<br>
Witness was being Called...and Roderick knew what the outcome was.<br>
Waylar’s eyes were dark and emotionless, and he took Roderick’s hand, leading him past the doors that had once held so much light for him, so much enjoyment. This is where he had grown up, this Guild Hall, his family was here, his childhood friends...<br>
No more..he would press for another journey, to be far from here. They were pressuring him, he knew, to be put on the list of possibles for the Guild Knight of Freeport, but there would be too many memories there. Her ghost would haunt him there, and he would never be able to forgive himself, let alone ask her forgiveness.<br>
Roderick found himself before eleven men and women....Healers and Necromancers, startling him with their appearance. Many were beyond the ravages of fatigue, having worked too long without rest and striving too much for a cause that had been gone before it had been begun.<br>
He saw their drawn faces, pale skin from seventeen days without sun and proper nourishment from Illiysha’s kitchens. He smelled greasy hair and unkempt bodies, stale robes brushing against his own body as he moved past each of them. He touched each shoulder that he could, feeling the lack of fat and poor muscle beneath it; these people had given themselves to do this, and had tried. Oh, they had tried, and he could do nothing more than fault himself for asking it of them. That none of them had died startled him more.<br>
He came to the table, to the hooded being who stared at him from beneath the cowl of a white robe, and to the body on the table before him.<br>
He had failed her...through the sands and Faydwer and Felwithe when he had held her crying over her first battle and the sights of it, to Freeport and her sire’s treachery, to Qeynos where his mother had fallen in love with her instantly and her duties to his own people through the Siege and then to Erudin where they would have gladly died for her again...simply because she gave all that she was to others, and asked nothingin return.<br>
Nothing...save the one thing she had asked as a child, asked as a teenager with a body full of demands and then as a young woman...a young woman whose words had once given him a smile when she had been a child, given him reason to leave on long journeys when she had been a teenager, and had, ultimately, changed the entire course of his life and being with her actions as a young woman searching for a way to make him see who she was.<br>
He, Roderick, had failed Alamathea...simply by not seeing what had been given to him, the gift extended, and he had not taken it for what it had been. It would haunt him forever, he knew this, and knew, then in a moment, that only with death would he be absolved of the guilt of not having admitted his affection for her at last.<br>
It was all he could do to not take the table down with him...for the body before him, the lifeless body without Soul or breath or even one to mourn it save these people within this room.<br>
Knight and General Roderick Peacekeeper, Knight of Truth and Duty, stared down at the body of Tiabrin on the table, and then up to the faces around him in horror. “What have you done?”<br>
“She gave what she had, so that another would live. She knew that she would not survive childbirth, for she was not of the physical form to do so, and that her life was near an end.”<br>
He looked to the robed figure, walking to it in horror, wondering later how he had not knocked her down in the process.<br>
The hood fell back, the hood of a True Healer, for none were permitted to wear the white robes until they had been truly confirmed as such, and no one had worn the white, Vreaa had spoken in Freeport, since before his own sire had perished three hundred twenty four years earlier.<br>
The hair was the same, darker from lack of sun and the hands well formed as he remembered them, and the bright eyes staring at him, feet steadying herself against his assault and two of the Necromancers moving in to pull him back.<br>
“Tiabrin wanted it,” she was whispering through a hoarse voice from lack of water and strength. “She knew she would die bearing the child...and she was already ill from a wasting disease she hid from Chathal...she chose...and they followed her wishes,” she said, motioning to the men and women around her in the loose circle.<br>
Roderick saw nothing else, saw nothing but the weight of a lifetime coming back to him in a surge of strength, and he caught her in his arms and lifted her bodily up before she could stop him. “What are you doing?”<br>
“What I should have done in Felwithe,” he cursed back at her, the Healers moving aside and suddenly a ragged gasp turning into a nearly deafening cry of triumph as he left the room with her in his arms...<br>
Left them all standing there, as Illiysha began laughing behind them as he made his way through the Guild Hall. It was to Lanadan she looked with a delighted look and a knowing grin. “He could have at least given her time to say ‘yes’ before taking her to his chambers...I know he didn’t get that from my side of the bloodline.”<br>
Lanadan had only kissed her forehead, chuckling himself as Tallik entered the room to find Tiabrin’s body, and the resurrection of one at the life of another was brought to bear on them all.<br>
