<br>
He was grateful for what little sleep they got, and more annoyed that his father did not trust him with Alamathea's life and a successful search for her whereabouts.<br>
Roderick had opened his eyes, stunned, to see the Teir`Dal boy simply sitting on the opposite wall of the room, staring at them in his mangled armor and his weary red-black eyes intently staring at the pair of them as they slept. Roderick's sword was beside him, he noted, brought there by the young dark elf, as well as Alamathea's Healer's Bags had been laid beside the sword.<br>
At a loss for words, Roderick sent the boy a dismal glare, one that normally brought his own troops into a frenzy of apologies and guilt...which to his surprise it worked, and there was a quiet whispering, frenzied and liquid of noise but nearly a whisper. The quiet whisper of the condemned and the horribly afraid.<br>
The sound of the language woke Alamathea, who opened her eyes to find her head on Roderick's leg and her eyes staring up at him, then turning to her healed Teir`Dal.<br>
There was a rumble of a chuckle, and Roderick pushed her hair from her eyes. &quot;He's saying something I don't have the first clue of what.&quot;<br>
It was a strange time, those pre-dawn hours, Alamathea curled between his legs for mental comfort, her voice questioning the Teir`Dal as best she could with Roderick's pressing question after question at him.<br>
&quot;So...he has lifted his head at last?&quot;<br>
Three faces lifted to the sound of the voice of contempt, the pale, hollow-cheeked face shrouded in robes that stared at the three of them, and the guards behind him looking into the small room. It was no surprise that Lanadan, and Illiysha, were there, and witness to what was happening.<br>
How much they had heard, however, was more frightening than the Teir`Dal's words and even later, assembled in the Guild Hall while the Necromancer who had found them questioned the dark elf boy again, before Witnesses.<br>
Roderick had been ordered to shower...that from Illiysha who had done the same to her husband, her stepsons who had come looking for their own, and the rest of the guards who had been therel. No exceptions. If her Guild Hall would need to be cleansed from the presence of a Teir`Dal, they might as well at least give him the notion that they were a clean folk to begin with and not living in their armor.<br>
Lady Alamathea had been sent to the same fate, though some of Illiysha's daughters, the two eldest twins taking the young woman into their care, would receive better pampering. Illiysha had been horrified to find the Teir`Dal in HER Guild Hall...flabbergasted that Lady Alamathea could interpret what he was saying...and dumbfounded that she was still in the stained dress and smock and sitting so unlady-like with her legs crossed and her toes sticking out from the hem of the dress and ankles showing and sitting against her son as if he owned her.<br>
It just would not do to have a Daughter of Freeport in such tattered display.<br>
Lanadan had sent out runners to summon all Knights to the Guild Hall...anyone who had ties to the Guild Hall and could be trusted to be judgemental, to be fair and honest and by the Duty and Honor that they served by.<br>
He knew, also, the consequences of letting too many folk know that there was a live Teir`Dal in the city, surrounded by Necromancer guards.<br>
The second questioning was being recorded on paper by four scribes, two Necromancer, two Guild, in four languages that would be sent out to the Guild Halls remaining. What those scrolls and missals would contain, Lanadan knew, would probably bring down the Guild as he and Illiysha knew it.<br>
The Teir`Dal was just that...a boy, sent from his homeland to tend to the armor of a swordsman of his own people. The Knights of Shadow were well-known for their prowess, dark scourge of the Knights of Truth and Duty that they were. He had no formal training, as his mind was probed also, in either sword or studies of magick. He was simply that...a boy chosen to tend to the armor of a swordsman.<br>
The boy's mind was, obviously, in a confusion of sorts. He had been commanded to the top decks, given a sword and when the boat had come close enough to the walkways of Qeynos, all of them had been ordered to leap and scour the city for conquest.<br>
The boy, being a boy and wanting adventure, wanting the fame of being there and having the right to brag of such things, stated he had leapt as the others had, but a wave had washed the boat slightly during his leap and he had landed in the water. Near-drowning with the sword, he had dropped it into the deep waters and climbed some of the wrecked pillars, making his way up the small shoreline for raftsmen and finding most of his fellow blood either in the rage of conquest or dead.<br>
He had hidden himself in the shadows, afraid that someone would find him, one of his own skin, and beat him, or worse, for not doing his duty, for loosing his sword and for not being able to tell of how many he had slain. He had watched them falling, watched Qeynos' own defending their city and, at last, as full night had fallen, he had seen little activity in the city and had deemed it safe to sneak out and, perhaps, attempt to make his way back to the homeland.<br>
He had startled himself by trying to find something to eat, and the walls collapsing on him. He had broken his legs in the attempt for food, and dragged himself out slowly after a while and deemed he must hide himself until they healed.<br>
What he found was a pair of eyes and a lantern staring down at him, and the shock of a knife in his shoulder that had been used, originally, for poking through debris safely. She had not meant to stab him, and he, as he mentioned later, apologised for startling her. He admitted they were both very scared and acted as they should have.<br>
Lanadan's calling in of the Necromancer's Circle had been a stunning blow to the ego of his own Guild Hall. NEVER had the Knights asked assistance from them...and yet, had not two of the Necromancers' own fallen in defense of the city? That had been enough to have him ask their consultation with the Teir`Dal. Lady Alamathea's word was not to be questioned, but she was also without sleep for several days, as was his son, and neither had had other Witnessess with them to verify the story.<br>
Twenty people were now listening to the story, Lady Alamathea there again, rapt fascination on her face as she sat perched on her chair wanting to say something, to ask something, but caught in the silence of dictates in that other, more important information was needed now.<br>
&quot;Cleaned up&quot; as she jokingly stated, her hair in a dark, wet mat that ran down the back of the chair nearly to the floor, her eyes bright with the moment's happenings and a deep maroon gown, nearly her size, puddled in the great chair that Lanadan normally rested in.<br>
Illiysha heard, without malice of course, that several were chuckling that it had taken nearly two days for her to dress Lady Alamathea up as one of her own daughters. A Guild Hall record if ever they had seen one.<br>
She had her own Duty to perform, and had not looked forward to it, stunned when, even after roaming the city alone and with Roderick, the young woman was chaste, untouched, and very, very much still smitten with wanting to explore the Teir`Dal homeland, still, and wanting to know when she could eat.<br>
She was also very, very curious on when Roderick would be joining them with the questioning...and did he have anything blue he could wear, as it would complement the maroon she was wearing, and his eyes?<br>
Illiysha had only chuckled, after turning from the young woman, and tried not to laugh. It would be wonderful to add this one to her Family...she only hoped it would be soon.<br>
By the next nightfall, having had most of those who could return to the city to their homes, those whose homes had been wrecked, they were given the courtesies of the Guild Hall and those of the other temples in the city. Lady Alamathea herself had been Called to the Temple of Light for questioning, at Illiysha's request, for a more intent study on some matters that had happened during the Siege of Qeynos and must be answered, as her duty as Guild Lady and seeker of all answers that must be sought.<br>
It was a good thing to be Guild Lady...for she could be as much a busybody with people's lives as she cared. It was a good thing.<br>
The mood in the Guild Hall, however, was anything but pleasant as the hours began to turn slower and slower.<br>
The Necromancers and Lady Alamathea's questioning of the young Teir`Dal had brought about more than Charges, more than fear of another attack and building rage that it had happened at all.<br>
To Lady Alamathea, sent away for the bulk of the questioning, on purpose by Lady Illiysha, she would learn of it from Lanadan and Roderick personally, Illiysha and her daughters there and Tallik, healing slowly but enjoying the pamperment of Illiysha's daughters for once.<br>
Lanadan was, as were all Qeynos-dwellers, cautious of the Necromancers. They had honored their pact of the bargain in helping to keep the city from falling, and had done that without going back on their word. The Necromancer's Circle had come without unkind word upon hearing that a Teir`Dal had been found and their language skills were required. The joint investigation had stunned both Lanadan's Guild Hall as well as the Necromancer's Circle, and both were very eager to question the next player in the whole scheme.<br>
<br>
<br>
-------------------------<br>
<br>
It had been a good meal, the Guild Hall somewhat nervous but welcoming, through Duty and Honor and Lanadan's stern words, and Illiysha's threat that the first to pick a fight with the Teir`Dal would marry her daughter that evening....and with the number of daughters she and Lanadan had, as well as the next one coming, though her husband was, to date, unaware of it.<br>
The meal had been specially prepared, despite the haste, and the Teir`Dal had been taken into the private dining area Lanadan and Illiysha had for themselves and guests. This evening, the Teir`Dal was, obviously, the guest of honor and against his better judgement, Lanadan had allowed his daughters, and his sons, to sit in on the boy's visit.<br>
He had turned out to be nothing more than that...a boy in a new city, his head amazed with all the wondrous things to be seen. Nor were Lanadan's daughters any less exuberant, and not caring in the least about his being a Teir`Dal. They wanted to know if he had someone in his homeland he cared for, what were his parents like, were they strict, did he live in the Guild Hall now, where had he gotten that scar on his forehead...on and on and on it had gone, with Lady Alamathea translating.<br>
Nothing of the true outcome of the questioning had come forth, and the Necromancer who had led the questioning had asked for the dark elven boy's silence, until the matter was brought up. It was obvious that, as all young must do, he looked to Lady Alamathea with his heart in his eyes and was constantly asking if she required any more for her plate, and that he would gladly get her something.<br>
The meal went well, all things considered, and the daughters were ushered out by their nanny, leaving Lanadan's grown sons, Roderick and Tallik, Lady Alamathea, Lady Illiysha, and two Necromancers who entered the room behind the Teir`Dal.<br>
As always, Lanadan began by thanking them all for coming, for what they had done to save the city, and spoke that the Lord of Qeynos himself wished to commendate them all personally at some future time.<br>
His eyes, however, rested on the Teir`Dal, who was looking nervously at Lady Alamathea, her eyes rapt in what Lord Lanadan was speaking. She looked at the boy beside her, then to her host and then to the Necromancers behind the boy's chair. &quot;What has happened?&quot;<br>
&quot;My Lady...we have...questioned the boy, you know this?&quot;<br>
She nodded, and looked around at the faces, so open only a while ago, now concerned...afraid if it might have been called that. What had happened?<br>
&quot;You know that he was questioned with the assistance of the Necromancer's Circle, as well as our own?&quot;<br>
Another nod, and she sat back in her chair. &quot;What did you discover? Did you finally find who sent them?&quot;<br>
Lanadan looked to Roderick, who was pushing his chair back to go to her, and he was refused, giving a growl and sitting back down to stare across the table at the young woman.<br>
&quot;My Lady...we have...discovered, without question, what has happened here, as well as the why and the whom. The why, obviously, has sadly become the easier of the two questions.<br>
&quot;This boy is from the City of Neriak, the Teir`Dal Homeland, and was sent here on a journey. He states that, nearly a half-century ago, a pact was made when a young Knight was exploring regions, at that point, unknown to the Guild.<br>
&quot;Upon being found by...strange things, who were fascinated by him, he was taken to their Lord, who questioned him as to whom he was, what he was doing so far from any cities and spoke with him on length of many matters...many, sadly, which he was to have been under Oath not to speak of.<br>
&quot;He promised something to this Lord...a promise in blood and in fire...in exchange for something.&quot;<br>
She was ashen, and Roderick's look frightened Illiysha and Tallik, across the table on either side of Lady Alamathea.<br>
&quot;A promise?&quot;<br>
Lanadan nodded to her, concerned for her lack of strength in her voice now.<br>
One of the Necromancers spoke up at last, voice gentle as it called out. &quot;Where did you acquire the wounds on your neck, Lady Alamathea?&quot;<br>
Her fingers touched them through reflex, and to that, she looked around, afraid. &quot;I don't remember...I've asked Roderick and his men but no one knows. They were there before they rescued me.&quot;<br>
The Necromancer nodded, looking to Lanadan, who nodded to something. &quot;We have reason to fear that there is a wizard here, in the city, who is calling these Teir`Dal to attack us.&quot;<br>
&quot;Here? But I thought...&quot;<br>
&quot;We thought the wizard was probably in service to this beast that took you from the desert oasis...for you were taken. This Teir`Dal knows how it happened and why. You were led there, truly...but not by Roderick to be stolen away for ransom.<br>
&quot;You were led there as a sacrifice...in exchange for power.&quot;<br>
&quot;Power?&quot;<br>
&quot;Ultimate power...and ultimate life. Has it not occured to you why your siblings are dead? Why they are always sent away on journeys and don't return? Always to places rarely known...rarely investigated due to the time needed to reach them?<br>
&quot;You yourself were, sadly, taken earlier than they expected. You were to have been taken in the Tower itself, the Tower of Darkness as it once was. The darkness refers to what it once was...the home of an undead of great power.<br>
&quot;An undead who now has a castle named for his greatness. And an undead who made a pact with one of the Knights of Light to become their sole leader.&quot;<br>
&quot;But there isn't such a thing...all the Guild Halls are ruled by a Council, and above that the cities send their own Councils to the Great Council.&quot;<br>
The Necromancer nodded, looking to Lanadan, and Lady Alamathea's confused eyes looked to the man. &quot;My dear Lady Alamathea of Freeport...we have investigated, and searched, and sent out runners as well as safe wizards to commune with Kaladim and those who remain in Felwithe.<br>
&quot;We have also sent a representative Necromancer to the City of Neriak...who returned only a while ago, before our meal, to bring us a scroll from their Guild Hall to verify what we have feared, and what we know is now truth.&quot;<br>
The napkin had already been torn in half by her fidgeting fingers, and Illiysha rested her hand on the young woman's arm, trying to soothe her. But there was no way to soften the blow, no possible way...they were all more than stunned when they had determined what had happened.<br>
&quot;The wounds on your neck, they are bringing the wizard to wherever you are. Until the Lord of Mistmoore is destroyed...the wizard will know wherever you are...because the wizard was once one of your brothers, now corrupted into something less a man, more a beast.&quot;<br>
&quot;No...&quot; It was her own voice...without emotion and very flat and hard.<br>
&quot;My Lady...this pact that was drawn in blood and fire...it was for power...power for power. It was deemed that this young Knight was powerful, and wanted more. But there is only so much power one can gain as a Knight, and the dictates of that stifled what he wished to do.<br>
&quot;In light of seeing nothing to come of his plans, he made a pact with one who could bring them into fruit...and he has been sacrificing his own children to the Lord of Mistmoore over the years to keep with the pact.<br>
&quot;He wants power...he sees himself as the ONLY Knight of the Guild....that he shall rule all the Guild Halls, or they shall perish, one by one, those who oppose him. And now, as there are only two true ones left at the current time, other than the Outpost in Firiona Vie, which has not, as yet, come under siege or attack...as Freeport holds him, Qeynos must fall for him to assume this title.&quot;<br>
&quot;Freeport is untouched still...&quot;<br>
&quot;He will not have his own city attacked...there would be nothing to rule. But once there is ONLY Freeport, he can make his bid for power and rise above us all to lead us on a campaign.&quot;<br>
&quot;A journey back to the castle,&quot; the Necromancer was stating. &quot;To supposedly rid the lands of this undead beast, all the while leaving men behind to guard areas who vanish and become the undead over time.&quot;<br>
&quot;A journey which would leave hundreds dead, My Lady...a journey that was to have begun when you were discovered dead by Roderick and his men at the ramp of the castle. He was to have returned with your body, and your Sire rising arms up against him...while in his absence, the Guild Halls, stripped of most of their men, were attacked and defeated one by one.<br>
&quot;With your death, the Lord of Mistmoore would have had the last piece he required to lay at the feet of our betraying Knight...a Healer of power...one we've not seen in many generations of Knights. One we never suspected to question...and to send to another Guild Hall for Training in another art.&quot;<br>
She was shaking her head. It was all too much at once, and Lanadan was continuing. There was no ending it now, she had to know.<br>
&quot;My Lady...tomorrow, scrolls will be received by Kaladim, Felwithe and the Outpost, outlining in detail what has happened and what we have investigated and determined to be truthful.<br>
&quot;I fear, tomorrow afternoon, Freeport time...we will be at war with ourselves within the Guild when the Charges are laid against our betraying Knight.&quot;<br>
She was shaking her head, but to which revelation, none could know.<br>
&quot;For collusion with the undead, for the death of his own children, for the deaths of probably hundreds over years and years, for the destruction, ultimately, of Felwithe and Kelethin and their folk...we will be hearing of Charges for many, many years now, My Lady. And you will be at the center of them.<br>
&quot;Whether you realize it or not...you are probably his last living child...and if you perish, it will be the catalyst that shall send us all to Mistmoore's Castle to defeat him.<br>
&quot;You were to have died to complete the pact...and by living, it continues to unravel instead of fold itself tightly to completion. Your life is now of utmost importance, and the healing of the wounds on your neck our goal.<br>
&quot;But...My Lady...above all this, above it all...you must realize what is coming, and what this will mean to you. Your Name may be stripped of you, simply for association with him, being his seed, all the Titles in Freeport may be forfeit, the homes he has acquired may be burned or simply turned over to the city for damages. Families may demand that you stand trial also for your role in it, though we have uncovered nothing that says you are part of it, merely that you were to have been the last sacrifice to a Tower of Darkness and to Lord Mistmoore.&quot;<br>
Lanadan looked old, he looked weary, but his concern for the white-knuckled young woman beside his wife and Tallik was more than he wished to have now. &quot;My Lady...you have been told what we have discovered, and now you must decide...not tonight! No, this will take you a while to decide...but you must decide, of your own will, what you wish to do.<br>
&quot;As you have taken no spouse, nor given Vows to the Guild on a whole, you are still beneath his rule.....and that of the Guild that houses you. But I fear, soon, you will be leaving us for another Guild...one where your skills as a Healer shall be put to a greater use.<br>
&quot;Your decision on where you stand on this, ultimately, is yours. Duty dictates you stand by your Sire, for he is that, but in this case, none would go against you if you chose to turn your back on him.&quot;<br>
It was too much...she was shaking, and the roar of her pushing her chair back, standing above them all and when had she started crying before them? &quot;You accuse a Guildmember of treason, of death and murder and betrayal...say it...damn you, say it and be DONE with it!&quot;<br>
Lanadan looked to Illiysha, to Roderick and then to his sons and the Necromancers, to the young Teir`Dal who had done nothing more than answer as he had been asked.<br>
&quot;The scrolls are to accuse Lord Antonanth Hopeseeker of Freeport of treason, murder, betrayal to the Guild that has sheltered him all these years, and the near-death of his own daughter, Lady Alamathea, at the hands of Lord Mistmoore. They have already gone out...they cannot be called back, nor will they. When they reach Freeport's Guild, we will, no doubt, be accused of turning the Charges against Roderick into this...but we have the proof. There is no other means of what has happened to be other than it is.<br>
&quot;And, I fear....they will come looking for you, in greater numbers. The Lord of Mistmoore...wants you, for your skills as a Healer, and upon that day, the pact he and your Sire made shall be fulfilled...one Supreme Knight, the other unleashed into the world of the living.<br>
&quot;May it not come soon...not without the deaths of those in this room first.&quot; He raised himself, and his glass, taking up his sword to lay it on the table. &quot;Upon my Duty and Honor, you shall not die before I do, Lady Alamathea.&quot;<br>
Tallik and Illiysha barely caught her as she fainted to the stones.<br>
<br>
