PART I - TEST OF PATIENCE <br>
<br>
1. Go to Gornit's island in OOT, approx. loc 800, -5400, kill Capt Surestout (green con at level 54, one ebolt kills him). A lesser spirit will spawn where he's killed, hail the spirit. <br>
<br>
Capt Surestout died. <br>
<br>
Your faction standing with PiratesOfGunthak got worse <br>
<br>
Your faction standing with FirionaVie got better <br>
<br>
Capt Surestout says 'You have run me through! Beware the Pirates of Gunthak.. They will avenge me.. Unngh!! <br>
<br>
a lesser spirit begins to cast a spell. <br>
<br>
a lesser spirit's body pulses with energy. <br>
<br>
a lesser spirit regards you indifferently -- You could probably win this fight <br>
<br>
You say, 'hail a lesser spirit' <br>
<br>
a lesser spirit says 'Did you take this person's life, shaman? <br>
<br>
You say, 'yes' <br>
<br>
a lesser spirit says 'Why have you taken this person's life, Waring ? Did he threaten your life? Did you dislike him? Or was his death a profit to you in some way? <br>
<br>
You say, 'he threatened my life' <br>
<br>
a lesser spirit says 'I see. It brings me sadness to see another die, but his heart was black and a great nothingness. His body will become the grass now. Thank you for what you have done, shaman. <br>
<br>
You say, 'who are you?' <br>
<br>
a lesser spirit says 'What, or who, I am isn't as important as what, or who, WE are. Do you wish to know more, shaman? <br>
<br>
You say, 'i wish to know more' <br>
<br>
a lesser spirit says 'That is good, Waring . Take this gem. It is a part of us like the clouds to the sky and is a wonderful gift from the grandfather. Take this gem to where the humans gather to spoil the land and water. Some call it a port. There you will find one of us, a shaman like yourself. Give him the gem and perhaps he will tell you more of the spirits. <br>
<br>
<br>
2. Head to North Freeport. Go in the sewers in the northwestern part of town, a little ways in on the inside of a colapsed wall is Bondl Felligan. Give the gem to him. <br>
<br>
You say, 'hail Bondl Felligan' <br>
<br>
Bondl Felligan burps loudly in your face and says, 'Bah! Leave me be, fool! You have nothin' I want and I certainly have nothin' you want.' <br>
<br>
à Give the tiny gem to Bondl <br>
<br>
Bondl Felligan says 'WOW, thanks! This must be worth a fortune! I could drink for a month after sellin' this to one of them fool merchants. I'm going to see how much I can get for it right now! <br>
<br>
Your faction standing with TrueSpirit got better <br>
<br>
You gain party experience!! <br>
<br>
NOTE: After giving him the gem once, simply going up to him and saying &quot;you can buy booze&quot; at anytime will cause the spirit to spawn in the room. No need to travel back to OOT. <br>
<br>
Next wait for him to move, follow him back out of the sewers onto the land outside, there he will stop and speak to you. <br>
<br>
Bondl Felligan says 'What!? You don't approve of me buyin' some drinks with this gem? Who the heck are you to offer me a gift and order me what to do with it? Is this some kinda conditional kindness? Well? Are you gonna let me buy some booze with this or not? <br>
<br>
You say, 'you can buy booze' <br>
<br>
Bondl Felligan suddenly becomes completely sober and says, 'Very well, shaman, please come with me.' <br>
<br>
After this you can follow him to the Jade Uncerground Inn or just go there yourself. Head up to the third floor, middle room and go inside. There you'll find a greater spirit waiting. <br>
<br>
You say, 'hail a greater spirit' <br>
<br>
a greater spirit says 'Greetings, shaman. Tell me, do you follow [Justice], [War], [Fear], or [Hate]? <br>
<br>
You say, 'i follow justice' <br>
<br>
a greater spirit says 'Ah, a follower of the Tribunal from the North you are, then. You would be best served by speaking to my brother in the next room. Farewell, Waring . <br>
<br>
Go to the room next door at the end of the hall. <br>
<br>
You say, 'hail a greater spirit' <br>
<br>
a greater spirit says 'It is good to see you, Waring . We're glad you trusted in our brother and did what was asked regardless of Bondl's intentions. This fills us with joy, as the [true spirits] work in ways most people would not understand and [trust] is the first lesson of the [Heyokah]. <br>
<br>
You say, 'what true spirits?' <br>
<br>
a greater spirit says 'As a shaman, spirits are known to you. They aid you if you pay them homage and respect the world around you. They also will bend to your will if you are powerful enough. We are a part of the entire universe and we exist because people believe and feel us. However [very few] know us in this form. To mortals we are but ideas, [wisps of consciousness] in an expanse of emptiness and as difficult to grasp as breath in Everfrost. <br>
<br>
You say, 'what very few?' <br>
<br>
a greater spirit says 'There are only a handful of mortals we've judged worthy to be friends and, reluctantly, masters. We call them the [Heyokah]. Bondl is one of them and he helps to test those we believe might be able to grasp our existence. There are many troubles that threaten us and our home. We seek those with the wisdom, patience, and might to help us ensure the health of the cosmos. Whether you seek balance or personal power, this is important to you. <br>
<br>
You say, 'what wisps of consciousness?' <br>
<br>
a greater spirit says 'It is difficult for mortals to grasp what we are for we are not material that can be held or consumed. We are the spirit that drives beings to do what beings do. The wolf lives to run and hunt. When you ask for his aid, his spirit enters your body and you 'become' wolf. The ox is the personification of endurance and when he enters your body, you do not become an ox, you become all that is ox. I myself am the spirit of understanding. <br>
<br>
You say, 'what trust do you speak of?' <br>
<br>
a greater spirit says 'Trust is the glue of the universe. When one trusts others to do their part, it allows them to focus on what they must do themselves. The trust that others have in us also gives us the confidence to do our parts effectively, thus maintaining harmony. When one becomes dissatisfied with his part and pursues his own desires, this is called greed. And greed destroys the glue of the universe. This is why we wished the bandits under the grass. <br>
<br>
You say, 'what heyokah?' <br>
<br>
a greater spirit says 'The Heyokah are our mortal counterparts. Some are our <br>
<br>
friends who seek to help us in whatever goals we deem important. Some seek nothing more than to enslave and command us to do their bidding. We accept this and often make deals with those we realize are powerful enough to accomplish what needs to be done. To judge such individuals, we have prepared a test. We ask that before we enter into these contracts, the shaman walk the [path of the Heyokah]. We see you may be worthy. Will you walk the path? You will be rewarded for your efforts, albeit grudgingly. <br>
<br>
à Recieve the opaque gem from the greater spirit <br>
<br>
Note: DO NOT say the following line until you receive the gem by saying the above line. The next line will cause him to immediately despawn but will start the next quest for you. <br>
<br>
You say, 'i will walk the path of the Heyokah' <br>
<br>
a greater spirit says 'That is good, Waring . You will need to walk three paths before you can reach that of the Heyokah. The paths of patience, wisdom, and might. First, you must learn patience. Take this gem and go on a pilgrimage to an island in the great water the wasichu call Erud's Crossing. The Kerrans there are our allies and can show you to our next contact, Ooglyn. Give Ooglyn the gem and do what she asks. As you walk the path, remember what you've learned about trust. <br>
<br>
<br>
3. Head to Erud's Crossing. Find Ooglyn, a female ogre shaman, on the island. Approx. loc -900, 1600. She should be up, if not her spawn time is 2 hours. Give her the gem. <br>
<br>
NOTE: As of now this quest is bugged. Before handing in the gem go to loc 0,0 in Erud's Crossing, if you see a naked human female floating above the water with no name then you NEED a gm to come and despawn her. Otherwise the quest npcs will not spawn and you'll have wasted that effort. <br>
<br>
You say, 'hail Ooglyn' <br>
<br>
Ooglyn says 'Ooooh, it you, Waring . Me's been waitin for you cuz our frenz say you comin an need da test. So's I gib you da test. Hmm, now where me put it? Ooglyn been waiting for sign for so long dat me forget where me put test. Keep your eyes out for sign while me look for test. Oh, hey, Waring , they gib you gem? I need dat gem, please, heheh. <br>
<br>
à Give the opaque gem to Ooglyn <br>
<br>
Ooglyn says 'Ahhh, tank you, now me can...OH LOOK!! DA SIGN!!!! Oh, sorry you missed it. The sign show you where to wait for da test. Follow me...I like you so I take you there. We goin for a swim, Waring ! <br>
<br>
Your faction standing with TrueSpirit got better <br>
<br>
You gain party experience!! <br>
<br>
Then she starts to run away, follow her until she disappears into the water. Then go in the water (make sure you have some sort of underwater breathing on) and head to loc -1600, 4200. She'll be waiting there for you in the water. Wait down there with her. <br>
<br>
Ooglyn says 'Ok shaman, let us be off. <br>
<br>
Ooglyn says 'Ok, here Is place for you to for waiting. Hab fun shaman! <br>
<br>
She then wanders away DONT follow her, be patient ! NPC`s will start spawning one after the other <br>
<br>
<br>
You say, 'hail Srafen the Soaked' <br>
<br>
Srafen the Soaked says 'Why hello there! Ahh, it's good to see a new face down [here]. So you've come to [wait] with [us] eh? That is splendid! It's been getting very boring lately. <br>
<br>
You say, 'Where is here?' <br>
<br>
Srafen the Soaked says 'Oh! Well this is where [we wait]. It's not much for looks but if you're lucky, a pretty fish will swim by. Oh, and once Dillon said he saw one of those fish women, a mermaid, he called it! Although, I'm not so sure of his state of mind, hehehe. He's been waiting here much longer than I. <br>
<br>
You say, 'Who is us?' <br>
<br>
Srafen the Soaked says 'Well, there's me, Srafen. I've been down here for, can't quite remember, a number of years, I guess. If my wife saw the condition my clothes are in, she'd whack me, I'm sure, heheh. Although I'd bet she's long since dead, probably. Then there's Dillon. He says he's been here since those people up top in Erud blew that big hole in the ground. Not sure what happened but I guess it was a long time ago. Hmmmm, who [else]? <br>
<br>
You say, 'What do you wait for?' <br>
<br>
Srafen the Soaked says 'We've been waiting quite some time, really. I have been here the least amount of time, but that doesn't help keep the boredom away, heheh. What are we waiting for, you ask? HehehHAahahah! What are we waiting for?? Heheheh, what a silly question! It's quite obvious if you take the time to think about it. Heh. Ummm.. I'm really not sure. <br>
<br>
You say, 'Who else?' <br>
<br>
Srafen the Soaked says 'Ahh, yes, there's also a really old guy I've only seen a couple times, name's Froham. Whew, he is really old, and not much of a talker. Mostly mumbles from time to time. Dillon says he's been here since Erud first took his people across the sea. Not sure who this Erud feller is but Froham isn't in the best of shape, so it must have been a LONG time ago. Froham did mention there's one other guy but we've never seen him. He apparently had something to do with the Combine Empire, no idea what that is though. <br>
<br>
These 2 NPC`s Spawn at the same time and are speaking to each other as well <br>
<br>
Dillon the Drowned says 'Well met again, Srafen. How goes it? <br>
<br>
You say, 'hail Dillon the Drowned' <br>
<br>
Dillon the Drowned says 'Hey Srafen, who is this weirdo talking to me? Or is it another one of those funny illusions Froham keeps talking about? <br>
<br>
Srafen the Soaked looks around frantically a moment then laughs and says, 'Ohhh, them! Hehehe! This is a friend of mine come to wait with us. Isn't that exciting, Dillon? And it's not just an illusion, I don't think! Say, are you [an illusion], shaman? <br>
<br>
You say, 'I am not an illusion.' <br>
<br>
Srafen the Soaked says 'Awww, well that's too bad. Although illusions and real people don't seem to be much different at times, so, please stay and keep Dillon and me company. We could use it, right Dillon? <br>
<br>
Srafen the Soaked says 'Hey Dillon, why don't you tell us again about what happened up top? You know, where they blew that big hole into the ground. <br>
<br>
Dillon the Drowned says 'Again? Oh I don't know Srafen, I don't want to [bore] our company, even if it is an illusion. <br>
<br>
You say, 'You won't bore me' <br>
<br>
Dillon the Drowned says 'Well ok, I was sent here a long time ago to wait. When I got here, I couldn't believe all the violence going on. Why would the spirits send me here to wait when all this fighting and commotion was going on, I wondered. There were great battles on the ocean in splendid ships made of pine and shining with [magical enhancements]. While I was waiting below, blasted, bloody body parts were floating down to the bottom of the ocean all around me. <br>
<br>
You say, 'What magical enhancements?' <br>
<br>
Dillon the Drowned says 'Yes, their ships were very strange, constructed in very unusual designs and all seemed to shine with a multicolored glow. I heard there was even a ship that could stay completely underwater for long periods of time. It had huge steel spikes protruding from the top of its hull used to 'swim' under enemy ships and puncture their hulls. I always thought that someday all this magic would cause something [disastrous] and eventually, it did. <br>
<br>
You say, 'What was disastrous?' <br>
<br>
Dillon the Drowned says 'Well, one time, I was here waiting as usual. The fighting was particularly heavy up top, lots of banging and rumbling around. And suddenly there was a tremendous screech! I had to cover my ears, it was so loud, even down here. It felt like the water itself was being torn asunder; I could imagine what was happening above. After a few seconds of the screeching came a terrible tremor and rumbling. Great cracks opened up around me and water rushed to fill them, almost dragging me down into the gods know what. It calmed down a little while after that and there hasn't been any real fighting ever since. I suspect they're all dead now. For weeks afterwards, the water had a kind of dead taste to it. I became ill during that time. <br>
<br>
At this point Froham the Forgotten comes in <br>
<br>
() Missing logs <br>
<br>
You say, 'who is abe' <br>
<br>
Froham the Forgotten says 'Yeah, Abe's an old guy. Well, he's kinda beyond bein' old if ye know what I mean. Not all together either. His mind floats all over like the sea around us. But he's got enough sense to wait here like he's done fer, well, fer dang near ever. If ye see him, and he ain't much fer talkin straight, ask him about [a broken arrow]. Not sure what it means to him but it seems to bring him around. <br>
<br>
Note : The skeletton swiming in the water named Froham the Forgotten, will wander off talking about a mermaid and a treasure DONT follow him its a test. Dont be greedy is the test Few minutes later another NPC will spawn. <br>
<br>
You say, 'hail Abe the Abandoned' <br>
<br>
Abe the Abandoned turns his head slowly toward you but his eyes never come into focus. You can't tell if he's looking at you, behind you, or right in front of his own face. Then ,suddenly, he shouts at the top of his lungs, 'HOOOOKAAAHEEEEYYYY! I AM [ABE]!' <br>
<br>
You say, 'who are you abe?' <br>
<br>
Abe the Abandoned says 'Nothing is hidden. All is discernible if you only know where to look and you have the right [eyes]. Don't be angry with me if you can't get your eyes right to see what you're looking for. I'd lend you mine but I don't wear the same size. <br>
<br>
You say, 'what eyes?' <br>
<br>
Abe the Abandoned begins to draw a picture in the mud with his finger although it doesn't seem to make any sense at all. He points to his picture and nods approvingly at you, saying, 'You see? The curtains fell and it was naught but a dream upon a landscape that we thought we knew. The dream of the [Combine] fulfilled when we finally trimmed our fingernails and looked into the mud. And now we are abandoned, in a world that none can see, no one has the eyes.' <br>
<br>
You say, 'what is the combine?' <br>
<br>
Abe the Abandoned shakes his head in amusement and says, 'Heheheh, yeah, <br>
<br>
you'd think so, wouldn't you? But I guess not' <br>
<br>
You say, 'what broken arrow' <br>
<br>
Abe the Abandoned 's eyes suddenly come into focus, looking deep into your own and says, 'There was a time when we cared for the world and trod with the spirits along the paths of the cosmos. We built many great things and worked to preserve what was. I came here to wait for an answer when we began <br>
<br>
to die off. We could not figure why this was and I was chosen to come here and commune with our friends. We carved an arrow, and everyone who was left shaved a sliver of wood from it. We let it drop to hallowed ground and our highest shaman stepped on it, breaking it. I've been waiting here for so long. So, so long, to give it to the spirits, and thank them.' <br>
<br>
à Sit down there for a few more minutes, then Abe will talk. <br>
<br>
Abe the Abandoned says 'Shaman? My time will soon be at hand and I fear I will never see our friends again. But the arrow must be given, our holy broken arrow. Shaman, will you bear our obligation and [give them the arrow]? You will know who to give it to when it is time. <br>
<br>
You say, 'i will give them the arrow' <br>
<br>
Abe the Abandoned removes a quiver slung across his shoulder and solemnly <br>
<br>
hands it to you without a word. <br>
<br>
Recieve a Broken Arrow from Abe <br>
<br>
Wait againCouple minutes later... <br>
<br>
Abe the Abandoned suddenly gasps and says, 'I have found it! I know the answer! Come with me and I will tell you. Eyes are everywhere and this knowledeg is not for everyone. Finally my centuries of waiting are over hahahaha! Follow me Shaman! <br>
<br>
Stay glued to that spot, don't follow him  The Greater Spirit is on the way with a shiny gem for you <br>
<br>
a greater spirit begins to cast a spell. <br>
<br>
a greater spirit's body pulses with energy. <br>
<br>
You say, 'hail a greater spirit' <br>
<br>
a greater spirit says 'You have walked the path of patience and you now know what to expect. We are watchers. Our eyes are everywhere and we must be patient and quiet else we may miss what could be harmful. Can you sit still quietly and wait for just the right moment, then open your eyes with a fury and act with all the energy you have cultivated? Timing is everything, and without patience you cannot be sensitive to timing. You have shown your patience here and we believe you are ready to walk the [next path]. <br>
<br>
You say, 'what is the next path?' <br>
<br>
a greater spirit says 'You know trust and patience. But before we can allow you to act in our name, we must know that when you do decide to act, you will make the right choices. We must ask that you now walk the path of wisdom. You must walk to the great plains and search out one of us. He is a wanderer, and it is his nature to drift with the winds and weather doing what he can to ensure understanding and longevity to all that respect their home. He will not be easy to find, though, and you must remember what you have learned down here to succeed in finding him. When you do, give him this gem and follow his instructions. <br>
<br>
<br>
PART II - TEST OF WISDOM <br>
<br>
4. Head to West Karana. Look for a wandering spirit (looks like a wisp). Not sure where it roams, just keep calling out you're looking for it or bring a tracker. When you find it, give it the sparkling gem. <br>
<br>
You say, 'hail a wandering spirit' <br>
<br>
a wandering spirit stops and flashes brightly for a moment. It seems to be regarding you with interest. <br>
<br>

5. Head to Rathe Mountains. You'll find Tabien the Goodly at loc ( 6300, 1550 ) near the Unkempt Preservers area next to a stone engraved with a closed eye symbol on it Approx level 35. <br>
<br>
You say, 'hail Tabien the Goodly' <br>
<br>
Tabien the Goodly says 'Oh thank Marr you are here, Waring . I was beginning to think I would be abandoned in my time of need. I have a [task] for you to complete in the name of my patron Mithaniel Marr. <br>
<br>
You say, 'what task?' <br>
<br>
Tabien the Goodly display his shield that must once have been shining and regal but is now scoured in cuts, dents, and chipped paint. He says, 'This shield is known as Marr's Promise. It is a sacred relic that was actually used by one of Mithaniel's angels on the Plane of Valor. Its value to our church is immeasurable and I have been charged with the protection of it. However, a patriarch of the false god, Bertoxxulous, is after my shield and me. He must be stopped! Please, destroy him and bring me proof of his death. <br>

Glaron the Wicked brandishes a long, wicked-looking bone dagger and there is a horrid, diseased stench as soon as he unsheathes it. He draws another blade, shorter and wider than the first, of blackened bone with a larger than normal hilt, obviously for defense. He says, 'This festering blade is called Woe, and this scorched one is called Envy. They were created on the Plane of Decay by Bertoxxulous' own hands. He has judged me worthy of the protection of such holy relics. However, there is one in these very mountains who seeks to destroy these relics.

Both paragons had lost sight of their virtures to protect the items given to them. The mere protection of these material belongings was not as important to Mithaniel Marr or Bertoxulous as it was that they act with righteousness in their minds and purpose in their hearts. You saw this and acted accordingly. For that, we will reward you with the three treasures made into one to ward off the falsehood of possession, the [Shield of Falsehood].

à Give him the sparkling gem you received from the wandering spirit. <br>

<br>

<br>
However, we must ask you to walk one more path before you can become a true Heyokah. With trust, one can focus on what is important. With patience, one can perceive what is harmful. With wisdom, one can know what must be done. These, you have learned, yet without the might to carry out what must be done, all is for naught. Are you [prepared to walk the path of might]? <br>
<br>
You say, 'i am prepared to walk the path of might' <br>
<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'Good, good, Do you know this place, Waring , this forest? The wasichu call it the Emerald Jungle, but we know it only as the terrible place. Where there is no spirituality, we are weak. The lost city in the middle of this jungle is a great void of belief not only absent of spirituality, but actually draining it from others. We are here to neutralize that void. The void is like the sky, and nothing escapes its gaze. If it senses us, it will drain us away and sometimes it turns our minds, making us [like the wasichu], crazy for things with no meaning. <br>
<br>
You say, 'what like the wasichu?' <br>
<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'Yes, there are some of us who have turned their backs on our world and struggle for possesions and power over others. These lost ones are our brothers and we cry for them. Our hearts are in pain like bleeding wounds when we think of them. The path of might will lead you to one of our lost brothers. We are afraid there is nothing we can do for him now, so you must eliminate him when you [find him]. <br>
<br>
You say, 'how do i find him?' <br>
<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'He left us long ago and walked the land for ages. He soon met a man, one of the pointy-ears that live underground. This man was like a void just liike the one over that terrible place now. Our Brother-Friend was attracted to this man's desire and ambition. He no doubt thought that he could get what he wanted in service of this [dark point ear] who denied his own creator. <br>
<br>
You say, 'what dark point ear?' <br>
<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'After our brother began traveling with this point-ear, they became shrouded in a darkness we could not peer through. The point-ear was a powerful being and we soon lost their trail. We have no idea where he could be now. Although, after all these centuries, he has no doubt been gathering and cultivating his wealth and power. He must be an incredibly influential being at this point. Find this point-ear and draw our brother out, then destroy him and bring us proof. We await your return in somber mourning. <br>

<br>
8. Go in Mistmoore Castle There is a Dire wolf in MM ( spawn time is 4 hours OR a triggered Spawn : Kill the Advisor in the castle`s Library area and it will spawn the wolf NOTE : He despawns after 35 min or so ) it is by the ramp leading up to the castle but you don't go up ramp instead head all the way back at base of ramp you will see 4 wolfs and a dire wolf in the middle ( You can pull him solo at level 57+ ) . In order to get a responce from the wolf you have to be Warmly in con. He is truespirit faction. the you walk up to him and hail him this is what he says: <br>

If they only knew the power I've become, the luxuries I've amassed, the pleasures I've known, they too would leave that sour and unrewarding existence in seconds. You know, you could come to know what I have, shaman. You found me, which speaks of your intelligence; we could use you. What do you say, Waring ? [Will you join] my master Mayong Mistmoore? <br>
<br>
You say, 'i will NOT join you' <br>
<br>
Black Dire says 'Good shaman, now bare your neck that I may show our master your devotion in death. The more blood you spill upon the grass, the more impressed our Lord Mistmoore will be. Then maybe, just maybe, you will be allowed to scour our kitchen floors in the eternity of unlife. TEAR him to pieces, my wolves! <br>

<br>
Spirit Sentinel begins to weep softly as he sees the pelt, battered and bloody. After a few moments, he says, 'We can only hope his passing was quick and painless. The Dire was powerful and yet you overcame him. Always remember that when you became [Heyokah], it was the passing of a noble, yet misguided being that allowed you to do so. You should hold a special place in your heart for him and what he was in life. To help you remember him, we will fashion this pelt into a pair of boots and give them to you. With every step you take, you must think on the Dire, else his death be in vain forever.' <br>

From now on, you are a direct link between the spirits and man. Whether your goals are to help us or master us, you are welcomed. Though there is little time for celebration. Do you feel the darkness of this place, the forest? To eyes not trained to see beyond physical appearances, it seems like any other forest. But you know, as do we, of the mantle over the city threatening all of us. We must [rub it out]. <br>

Spirit Sentinel says 'There are many such mantles scarring the universe and each is very different from the last. Removing them requires that we learn how they were created and go about reversing the damage done. We cannot enter under the mantle for long which is why we search out Heyokah such as yourself. We need you to enter the city and find out what you can about the [city's demise]. We hope you will do this for the cause of balance but if you desire none but your own power, we shall grant that as well <br>
<br>
You say, 'what about the city's demise?' <br>
<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'It was known as Torsis. During its history it amassed great wealth and power yet it eventually crumbled. No one understands what happened. The men of the world ask themselves how a nation as successful as Torsis could ever fall. Some blame plague, internal unrest, the constant encroachment of the forest, and marauding bands of monsters but we alone know what happened. Just as Tabien and Glaron lost sight of their spiritual paths, so did Torsis. Without the awe and inspiration of that which was greater than themselves, they eventually withered away. The mantle was born long before the last days, though, and what we need to learn is [how it all began]. <br>
<br>
You say, 'i will learn how it all began' <br>

Spirit Sentinel says 'Excellent! Go into the city and gather what evidence you can. The ghosts who still walk the streets may hoard precious memories that will aid us.

I heard last night that there was some kind of commotion at the castle. Guards were shouting, spells went off throughout the halls and many died. Some say there was an assassination, some say a band of froglocks attacked under the command of a dragon, some even say there was divine intervention. I have no idea why any god would strike against Lord Rak'Ashiir. He is the paragon for the cause of Cazic-thule. I hope whatever it was sticks to attacking the castle and not my shop though. <br>

Hear all Torsis! Our beloved Lord Rak'Ashiir will be appointing another High Priest into the Cazic-Thule clergy in two days.

The list should all be in order except for the swatches of silk. I won't need such a large order in this quarter. Her Divinity Drian made it known to me that they would not need as many new robes this coming season as &quot;none were quite ready to don them.&quot; My colleagues have all been confirming that the church is buying less and less these days. It seems Rak`Ashiir has decided the royal donation to be cut. However I'm sure we'll find new customers soon and our orders will be back to normal shortly. <br>

Hear all Torsis! It is with great regret that we inform you of our Queen, Neh'Ashiir's disappearance. Our best scouts have begun searching the surrounding countries for her trail. The lord Rak'Ashiir also authorized the hire of mercenaries to venture into Froglock Territories to search for traces of the Queen. All interested parties should report to the royal Quartermaster's office. Fear not citizens, our Queen will be found. Wisdom guide us. <br>

Well it appears our Lord Rak'Ashiir in his &quot;wisdom&quot; has cut our church's donation yet again. He claims it is to bolster the ranks of our garrison as many were wiped out during the Froglock incursions. However, I see more and more soldiers everyday, more that I ever have. And they are all equipped in the best armors the city's smiths can craft. This along with the recent replacement of our Bishop Screks with that coin grubber biliaz leads me to suspect our King is planning on all but destroying the church entirely. I don't understand it, perhaps his missing Queen has driven him mad. <br>

Missed mass again today. This is the third time this week now. It is a worthy sacrifice however as I was able to attend the Master's National Coin exchange class. Perhaps the clergy will change the time of their masses, then I'll be able to attend regulary. Although with the appointment of the new Arch Priest it appears mass may be discontinued altogether. I honestly hope so. I could attend many more classes as well as spend more time rubbing elbows with merchants at the bazaars. I think I'll have to miss tomorrow's mass as well. I heard the Laughing Leech Guild is taking members again. <br>

Spirit Sentinel says 'Ahhh good, let us hope what you have found will point us in the right direction. Hmmm...this is interesting. It appears the disappearance of the first queen may have caused Rak'Ashiir's faith to decline. From there, the first King Rak laid down the groundwork for the city's eventual demise. We need to learn what happened to the queen. Perhaps bringing this knowledge to the King's now cursed form will lift the mantle. We've learned that the last lord of Torsis, Ghiosk, was a bit of a historian. Find him and see what you can learn about the queen.

_____________________________________________ <br>
<br>
Book 1 -- Historic Article, it identifies as &quot;A Book From Ghiosk's Collection&quot; <br>
<br>
Neh Ashiir's disappearance will always be cloaked in mystery. We of Torsis have a saying that goes &quot;Neh`s chances&quot;. We all know this is used to define an innumerable variable but not many know of its relation to the event in the early years of our fair city. For as many people as there were in Torsis there were that many theories regarding Ne Ashiir's disappearance. Others say there were political tensions between the queen and her lord, so much so that she had to leave to escape death. And for good measure a few pointed to the stars and said that people from beyond the sky took her. One thing all agreed upon however is that the relationship between the royal couple was decaying. Political scrutinizers noted small personal habits between the two implied a separation of intimacy during their public appearances. Many even tie the highly publicized Crusade of Kim into the disappearance of Neh as Kim left the city only a few weeks before. It is recorded in many texts that the visage of Rak`Ashiir reflected his dispair over his wife's vanishing although it is a well know fact that it was mostly an act played by the King to keep up his illusion of nobility. Perhaps one day we will find the truth but at this point it would mean little to the public. <br>
<br>
Book 2 -- Head Housekeeper's Log, identifies as &quot;A book From Ghiosk's Collection&quot; <br>
<br>
1. New wash basis must be aquired. Servant Hujin will see the Quartermaster and place the order tomorrow. <br>
2. The chandelier in the main hall was finaly repaired tonight. Payment must be sent to the to the contract holder tomorrow. <br>
3. Advisor Snith ordered that I personal find and acquire 3 dozen finely made vials. What they are for he would not explain and was very firm that I do this as quickly as possible. Best to make haste to fulfill the order, rumors abound of the Advisor's mastery of the arcane. <br>
4. We've been low on candles for the last week. There is no explanation for the shortage of wax says our civilian contract holder. Perhaps I should send a Palace Reaver escort with the next pick up crew. The craftsman may have the intelligence to figure the symbolism. <br>
5. It is imperative that we return the High Scale's Icon to the church as discretely as possible. If Rak Ashiir returns from his journey early and discovers it was found in the royal bedroom it may prove disastrous. I cannot decide whether to place it ourselves with help of our Black Guard, or to approach one of our contacts in the church. The less people that know of this better. It might be prudent to ..remove.. the servant who found it within the sheets. <br>
<br>
Book 3 -- Crusades of the High Scales, identifies as &quot;A Book from Ghiosk's Collection&quot; <br>
<br>
Throughout the history of the High Scale it was common for the knights to practice complete celibacy. It wasn't until the controversial Kim was given the hallowed title that contact between sexes became tolerated. While Kim wasn't the mightiest of the High Scales he was able to achieve many great victories in the name of our Lord of Fear. One being the battle know as the Bone Rending when Kim lost his fabled whip. Thriaxis' Tail, and was still able to defeat scores of his enemies using his hands only. Before this battle many believed Kim could not fulfill his duties as a leader and patriot for the people. However Kim's might and his lecture on the use of females in religious crusade and duty convinced the puclic that celibacy had its place in divinity but non-celibacy also had a place and value within the church. A shrine depicting Kim among many women was constructed in remembrance of his controversial reign although his corpse was never brought back for burial as it was lost far across the ocean among distant brothers in faith <br>

Spirit Sentinel says 'Hmmm, it appears the queen's disappearance wasn't as random as we thought. It also looks as if this High Scale were having some sort of affair with Neh. We have little but speculation at this point, so making it known to Nak'Ashiir would do nothing. Perhaps finding the resting place of the High Scale will show us more of what really happened. We suspect the icon mentioned in this log could now be located in the city's old temple. Find the icon and bring it to Kirn, wherever he is. Tell us what you learn afterwards. <br>

12. The return to City of Mist <br>
<br>
NOTE : To save a trip to CoM I suggest looting the icon while collecting the report pages <br>
<br>
à Go loot the Icon of High Scale on the floor <br>
<br>
From the zone in, walk across the bridge and open the gate. Turn right at the statue, run straight forward through 2 arches. You are in a temple part of the city ( on your left you should see a door and some waterfalls on the side of temple ) That is the base camp. Pull all the mobs from behind that door you see at the base of the temple. Inside is another door directly in front of you, do not open this door, it leads to the top levels of temple. Look to your right, there should be 3 skeletons and some phantoms ( or there should have been :P ) Walk down the stairs. There are two doors beside the stairs, one opening to the left and one opening to the right. Choose the left door. Inside is a small room with no monsters inside, and a small bag on the floor in the left corner. Loot and run Click on the bag, congratulations, you now have the High Scale Icon. <br>
<br>
<br>
There were no rogue-locked doors between the zone and the High Scale icon. And I suggest doing a suicide run get in get out ( but use a map before ! ) <br>
<br>
<br>
13. THE FINAL STEPS <br>
<br>
High Scale Kirn is to be found in the Hole. at the revenant castle at the top end of the tower. He is pretty obvious once you get to the top of the tower as he stands in the middle of the room in front of you. Kirn spawns in the dead city crypt, in a tower way down. <br>
<br>
NOTE : Get a ball of golem clay from the clay golem in Cazic Thule, and use the charge of earth elemental illusion. Then everything in the hole will be amiable-warmly unless you've spent a LOT of time there. <br>
<br>
à Give the icon to High Scale Kirn he said : <br>
<br>
High Scale Kirn looks down at the icon in his hands for a long moment before speaking. 'Why did you bring me this? Are you here to accuse me of the queen's death?' High Scale Kirn chuckles venomously and continues, 'I am High Scale and beyond your petty laws. However, I wish the truth to be known. On my hand is a ring. If you can take it from me, show it to the queen and she will remember. However, I will not give up the ring easily. <br>

Underwater Pond ( Revisited ) <br>
<br>
à Give the Diary to the Sentinel Spirit in the pond-- <br>
<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'So, the truth is found! Nak mourned over the loss of his child instead of relishing the blessing of his god, Cazic-Thule. His wife and the High Scale then abandoned him in disgust, but even that was an aftereffect of what caused the king to turn his back on his faith. The child is the key! If we put the child to rest, Nak may repent of what he has done and the mantle may be lifted. The most difficult task is now at hand. Find the child, then take proof of her passing to Nak. I can feel the mantle's foundation crumbling! Now, go! <br>

City of Mist The Final encounter <br>
<br>
à Then bring proof of Childs death to Lord Rak. <br>
<br>
He respawns, talk to him. Listen to his troubles...follow the story line till it ends. Then we had to think. He asks about his first test...what is the first test? <br>
<br>
Lord Rak`Ashiir looks down at the tear in his hand and says, 'A minion of my god came to me one night. I knew it was of Cazic-Thule as I was frozen in terror. My mind screamed for me to flee but my body would not respond. The being took my daughter and vanished to only he knew where. When I regained control of my body and thoughts, I felt nothing but [betrayal] and I immediately set out to abandon Cazic-Thule.' <br>
<br>
() Trust, Patience, Wisdom? .. Missing Info here <br>
<br>
Lord Rak`Ashiir stands dumbfounded for many moments before finally speaking again, 'Kirn was right. Before he left my side and that of Torsis he told me I would have the blood of my own people upon my hands. How could I be so foolish? Even my idiot wife could see the truth. How could I begin to fathom the depth of a god's mind and the reasons for his actions? Kirn's prophecy has come to light. You have shown me the truth and now I have no more use for this. Take it away from me, please, and do with it what you will. My father was as much a fool as I have been. <br>
<br>
àRecieve a scale <br>
<br>
<br>
Emerald Jungle Last chapter <br>
<br>
à Give the scale to the EJ spirit... <br>
<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'What is this? The scale of Rak'Ashiir's father? Then Rak has repented his mistake? But why is the mantle still in place? If Rak has repented, then the mantle should have dissolved since he was the one who initiated its construction. But is its initiation the key? How could we have been so blind? Kirn said Rak'Ashiir had the blood of his people on his hands but that is false. Rak merely pointed to a path that would lead them to destruction. It was the people who chose to follow <br>
<br>
You say, 'What is lost' <br>
<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'The mantle was the product of thousands of faithless individuals. Not the single shroud we believed existed. Torsis is now truly cursed for all eternity as a great stain upon the universe. Today is a sad day, indeed. However, some good can still come of this. Your sacrifice and spiritual devotion in this matter have become legendary. You have waited for us at the bottom of the ocean. You have rubbed out a mighty rogue spirit. You have endured the black hole of Torsis and entered the a bode of Fear itself to save a child from eternal suffering. It is only fitting that we reward you with our greatest treasure, the [Spear of Fate]. <br>
<br>
You say, 'What of the Spear of Fate' <br>
<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'The spear was constructed millennia ago by Thalger, the first human Heyokah. One of the most destructive wasichu of Norrath, Miragul, as he is known, had been traveling the world searching out all known magic. Wherever he went, he discovered and experimented with all forms of dangerous magic. Most of the world cannot even fathom what the Arch Necromancer was capable of. He had haphazardly discovered a way to directly create a mantle of negative spiritual energy similar to what curses Torsis. He himself had willed into existence one of these [black holes]. <br>
<br>
You say, 'What of thease Black Holes' <br>
<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'Miragul often retreated to the frigid northlands to experiment in solitude. It was here that he created a black hole. Unfortunately for the small tribes of men who made the northlands their home, this new black hole threatened not only their livelihood but their entire existence. The mantle was so powerful it not only drained the spiritual energy of everything within its gaze, it also drained the life force as well. The tribes were threatened with complete annihilation. But one [powerful shaman] stepped forward and struck against Miragul's mantle. <br>
<br>
You say, 'What powerful shaman?' <br>
<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'Thalger had been the first to pass our tests and the timing was lucky indeed. We supplied him with materials needed to construct a weapon that could pierce the very fabric of the [cosmos]. First, was the sharpened shoulder blade of an ancient lion matriarch. Then Thalger found a young sapling for the shaft and shaped it over the course of 45 days using nothing but his fingernails. He then split the top of the flexible shaft, lodged the blade into place and bound them together with the tanned entrails of an ox. Finally, he adorned the spear with the magical feathers of a an aviak elder. <br>
<br>
You say, 'What of the cosmos?' <br>
<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'Miragul's casting was strong but it was a force brought into existence. This force was positive in nature, the opposite of nothingness. Even though it worked like a void, it was still created by an imposition of will. We figured that if we could rupture the planar boundary and create enough anti-existence or non-matter, the mantle might destroy itself. Thalger volunteered immediately to pierce the mantle as no spirits could even get close to it. In one act of devotion and singular purpose, Thalger rode the wind far above the land and with one colossal arch ripped a [breach] across the planes. <br>
<br>
You say, 'What of the breach?' <br>
<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'The tear in the fabric of existence created enough negative material to cancel out Miragul's abomination. Thalger's strike was so perfect that he cut just enough planar material to destroy the mantle and nothing else. Unfortunately, Thalger himself was lost in the process. All that was left was the spear that fell from the heavens to the ground where we recovered it. We have kept it since then and now we wish you to have it. When you strike with it, you must have the same singularity of purpose as did Thalger when he defeated Miragul's mantle. <br>
<br>
Thank you, Heyokah Golan. <br>
