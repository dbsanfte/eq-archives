						<FONT FACE="ARIAL" SIZE="3" COLOR="YELLOW"><li>Telin Darkforest in Burning Woods: Ask "what action" and you will get a note. If not, then your faction is too low. Faction can be built up fast by doing the muffin-quest in Freeport.
						<li>Faelin Bloodbriar in Greater Faydark: Give her the note and you receive a ring. Faelin roams the northern part of the zone near Crushbone. She is a rare spawn and can have orcs as placeholders. After giving her the note she depops.
						<li>Giz X'Tin Kithikor: Give him the ring, get a dark metal coin. Giz roams along the path. After u hand him the ring a lvl 50 Darkelf Reaver spawns and attacks but u can run away with SoW.
						<li>Go back to Telin Darkforest and give him the Coin. He will give it back to you as worn metal coin. He tells you to find Athele.
						<li>Athele in East Karanas: Give her the Coin and receive a worn amulet. Give this amulet to Sionae, then to Nuien and finaly to Teloa. The last step is the trigger for the Dark Elf Corruptor and two Darkelf Reavers (I think all about lvl 48 to 50) to spawn. Find the Corruptor and kill him fast on the hill north of the river. He will depop after 10 seconds if not attacked. The 2 Reavers will head to the 4 Druids and kill them. You dont need to kill the Reavers. Just kill the corruptor and loot the tome. The best way is to have one or two friends on the hill that can start fearkiting him. If the Druids die, never mind....Athele spawns again in about 1 hour. Give Athele the tome and get an earthstained Note. Bring this to "she who walks the land in service blabla...".
						<li>Ella Foodcrafter in Misty Thicket is this wanted women that wanders the zone. Give her the earthstained note and she will tell you that she needs a mixture. She will give you her mixing bowl. It is a Container so you need a free slot in the Inventory. She also mentions some kind of ancient bowl that she needs.
						<li>The Hardened Mixture<br>You must forage 4 items that you have to combine in Ella's mixing bowl.</FONT>
							<FONT FACE="ARIAL" SIZE="2" COLOR="YELLOW"><ul><li>Frozen Tundra Root from Everfrost Peaks
							<li>Sweetened Mudroots from Misty Thicket
							<li>Speckled Mushrooms from Innothule Swamp
							<li>Heartfruit from Greater Faydark</ul></FONT><FONT FACE="ARIAL" SIZE="3" COLOR="YELLOW">This can take several hours. Combine those 4 items in the bowl and you get a Hardened Mixture.
						<li>The Runed Bowl</FONT>
							<FONT FACE="ARIAL" SIZE="2" COLOR="YELLOW"><ul><li>Go to the Chess Island (succor will take you there when you have enterd the zone) in Timorous Deep and ask Alrik Farsight "how do you make an ancient bowl?" . He gives you a crushed pot and sends you to Felwithe to talk to Farios Elianos.
							<li>Talk to Farios Elianos in Felwithe south. If he dont respond to you then your faction with Keepers of the Art is too low. You can build up faction fast with the batwing- quest in Felwithe south. If Farios talks to you, give him the pot and you receive a grocery list. He will give you the receipt for the bowl if you do a job for him.
							<li>Bring this grocery list to Merchant Nora in Felwithe north and she gives you in return a bag of Provisions. Bring it to Farios and he gives you the receipt for the ancient bowl.
							<li>Head back to Alrik Farsight in Timorous Deep . He will give you an ancient pattern when you give him the receipt. The pattern says that you have to combine it with a piece of echanted clay and platinum speckled powder in a pottery wheel. NO skill in pottery required.</FONT>
								<FONT FACE="ARIAL" SIZE="1" COLOR="YELLOW"><ul><li>Platinum speckled poweder can be obtained through another subquest. Forage a Rose of Firiona in Firiona Vie and give it to Merdan Fleetwood in Surefall Glades. The old wooden painting that you receive has to be brought to the human skeleton that roams the western part of Frontier Mountains. Head back with the silver chained locket you got from the skeleton to Surefall Galdes and give it to Niera Farbreeze. She hands you the platinum speckled pouder.
								<li>Enchanted clay can be obtained through Kinlo Strongarm in Kaladim's Everhot Forge. If you ask him "what mud" and "do it for me" he will tell you that he would like to have a colored axe for his service. This is a Jade Reaver that can be found in the City of Mist. Hand him the axe and you get the enchanted clay. I am sure if you are kos to the dwarfs then you can do this part invisible. Just go to the Everhot Forge and hand Kinlo a Jade Reaver to get the clay.</ul></FONT></ul><FONT FACE="ARIAL" SIZE="3" COLOR="YELLOW">Now combine the pattern, clay and powder in any pottery wheel to make the Rune Crested Bowl
						<li>Go Back to Misty Thicket and hand Ella Foodcrafter the hardened mixture and the rune crested bowl. She will make for you a softly glowing stone from it.
						<li>Ella tells you to find one such as yourself. For the Druids this means to seek out Foloal Stormforest in Firiona Vie. Ask her "are you one such as myself? ", "what answers?" and "what about Venril Sathir?". She tells you to bring her the stone you already have from Ella and the gem that can be found on Venril Sathir.
						<li>Kill Venril Sathir in Karnor's Castle and loot the gem he drops. Venril is a very tough lvl 55 Necromancer that can only be beaten by very strong guilds.
						<li>Give the gem and the softly glowing stone to Foloal Stromforest and get a warm pulsating stone. Now this is the time where the quest splits up into the Druid and the Rangerpart. Foloal tells you to take the stone and walk your path.
						<li>The Druid's path leads back to Ealla in Misty Thicket. Give her the stone and you will get the Elaborate Scimitar (10/30 9wis 10mana 5sv poison and disease)....now you have one of the four final pieces. She asks you to collect the Cleansed Spirits of Antonica, Faydwer and Kunark and hand them along with the scimitar to Xanuusus.

PH are the Seafury Cyclops) in Ocean of Tears and from <li>the Corrupted Brownie (Brownie Scouts are PH. They are green to 56/57 and give exp. Each can pop the tainted so it is possible that 2 or even 3 tainted roam the area. They are druids and the corrupted is a lvl 52 druid so you need help from 2 or 3 people.

He is near the mines on the left side of the green river. There is another greeny gnome near him but you can do this part with super camou on you if you are kos or otherwise disliked there because you need no faction for Silox.
