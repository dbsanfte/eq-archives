<font color="#ffffff"><b>03:03:04: Major Updates..</b></font><br>
* All Authentic profile tags have been removed from the database. This means, if you had an Authentic icon next to your profile prior to today, it will not be there until you update your profile again. (keep reading..)<br>
<br>
As of today you will have an option for each character in your magelo options that allows you to 'auto update' your profile to EQRankings. (Update your character > Privacy Settings > Keep this character synced with EQ Rankings)<br>
<br>
If this option is checked, everytime you run Magelo update, or save your profile, your character will automatically be updated to EQRankings. The ONLY way the Authentic Icon will appear here on EQRankings, is if you update your Magelo profile with Magelo update.<br>
<br>
* You will also see the total amount of Authentic profiles listed on the main page of EQRankings. (ex: 31337 (<font color="#ffcc22">1337</font>) )<br>
<br>
* Guild Management tools are now working. We have done a partial guild wipe for all guilds with less then 50 members.<br>
<br>
If you do not see your guild listed, You should ask your Guild Leader to re-register it and upload a guild dump to add all of the guilds members.<br>
<br>
If your guild is registered and no one has access to modify the information (website, members, etc) you can eMail us at <a href="mailto:guilds@eqrankings.com">guilds@eqrankings.com</a> for a password reset.<br>
