<font color="#ffffff"><b>05:11:04: Missing profiles...</b></font><br>
If your profile was removed within the last 24 hours, it was due to a database rollback that was performed yesterday. All profiles that were 'submited' to eqrankings within  24 hours before yesterday afternoon were removed.<br><br>All you need to do is resubmit your profiles to EQRankings to correct this issue.<br>

<font color="#ffffff"><b>03:10:04: Auto Synch re-coded..</b></font><br>
I've completely recoded the way we handle direct Magelo auto-sync requests. All profiles synced to EQRankings via Magelo's auto-sync feature have a 2 minute delay before processed.<br><br>
Please keep in mind, Our caching system is still in effect, so you may not see the Authentic icon appear next to your name for up to 15 minutes after running Magelo Update.<br>

<font color="#ffffff"><b>07:09:04: Missing Profiles...</b></font><br>
Your profiles are NOT missing. There is an error with Magelo Update which is causing profiles to be moved to the Antonius Bayle server. You will need to log into your account on Magelo.com and set your character back to the correct server, then re-submit your character <b>manually</b> to EQRankings.<br>

<font color="#ffffff"><b>26:08:04: Guild Kills...</b></font><br>
I have updated the way Gates of Discord zones are displayed on the Guild Kills feature. They now show progression via mob encounters per zone.. Go ahead and update your kills!<br>

<font color="#ffffff"><b>18:08:04: Most Popular Profiles...</b></font><br>
You may notice some never-before-seen profiles listed on the Most Popular Profiles page. This is not a bug. We just corrected an error that was not allowing certain profiles to show up on the list.<br>
<br>
The remove/vote profile off feature has returned. However, profiles will not be removed unless 10 unique visitors have voted them off.<br>

<font color="#ffffff"><b>12:08:04: If your guild isn't listed anymore...</b></font><br>
It's because your Guild Leader is lazy and has not logged in within the past month since we've added the new DOB verification.<br>
<br>
Anyway, get in touch with whomever is in charge of it and have them re-register.<br>
