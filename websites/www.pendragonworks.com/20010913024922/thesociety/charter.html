    <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <FONT color=#ffff00>SECTION 1 - Leadership 
    of Guild</FONT><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Run by two 
    leaders and a council. See membership pages for leaders and officers 
    names.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notes: Once 
    a member is made a officer, all of that members characters are officers.</P>
    <P><BR><FONT color=#ffff00>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SECTION 2 - Guild 
    Justice &amp; Review</FONT><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    Any&nbsp;violations of the guild rules must be reported to a guild officer. 
    Violation/Complaint will be promptly reviewed by a Leader AND at least TWO 
    officers, who will hear evidence from both the accuser and the accused. 
    Repercussions can include any or all of the following depending on the 
    severity of the infraction, Verbal Warning, Fines, Loss of Officer 
    status/Expulsion. Decisions made by the required Leader and Two officers will 
    be explained to the accused prior to any action being taken and will be 
    announced to the entire council at first chance.</P>
    <P><BR><FONT color=#ffff00>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SECTION 3 - 
    General Rules</FONT><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Society is based 
    on brotherhood, it is expected that we all help our guild and guild brothers 
    and sisters. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use of guildchat- Never use 
    guildchat to complain against another members. Complaints and reports of 
    violations should only be made to guild officer thru /tell. Otherwise guild 
    chat is at your discretion.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If A member has an 
    item for sale or donation please give consideration to fellow guild members 
    before going public <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for other forms of 
    assistance the basic rule is simple: All members if safely possible to 
    render aid to a guildmate should do so, not limited to time or zone 
    restrictions.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NO Kill Stealing- Defined as 
    intentionally taking someone or some parties pull or not following a fairly 
    established rotation at a camp.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members 
    are responsible for those they are hunting with. If a member of your party 
    is behaving against the guildlines of "The Society" then you could be 
    considered guild by association.</P>
    <P><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <FONT color=#ffff00>SECTION 4 - Guild 
    Funds</FONT><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Guild funds will 
    be maintained for now thru donations only. If you can donate to guild fund 
    great. There will be mules (equipped with backpacks) in or near each major 
    area to whom you may give the donations. Records of these donations will be 
    updated at officer meetings. These guild funds will be used to help out 
    members in need at the discretion of Guild leadership, also for guild events 
    and possibly quests. </P>
    <P><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <FONT color=#ffff00>SECTION 5 - Guild 
    Recruitment Policy</FONT><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The 
    Society" will be looking for new members. Membership policy forthcoming, in 
    the words of one of our leaders "I'd kind of would like us to start recruiting heavy 
    not only Higher levels but worthy newbies 
    also".<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>

<P><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <FONT color=#ffff00>SECTION 6 - Guild Alliance Policy </FONT><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The 
    Society" is always for and will always support helping others which includes other guilds.  However we will NOT entertain "mergers" with any other guilds.  We believe simply that we would lose our identity as "The Society" if we were to dilute ourselves with merger after merger.  We value being the "family" that we have come to know and appreciate.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
