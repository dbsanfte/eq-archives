Ahh,Kirby.let him go,he can do very little,alone.(bonus pts if u can guess which movie that quote came from).<br />Is PKing dead on Rallos?I don't think so,it HAS changed for sure.Nowadays there seems to be less guys who are PKing with their main.Also,guildless PKs far outnumber guilded ones,even way more than they used to,Whats happened to PKing on Rallos is simple.Planes of Power.Now everyone is using their high level guy.In my guild,INIMICAL,we had many many people who had high level mains in guilds like Celestial Gimpire,Druids Empire,Omniscient,VVS,etc.Since PoP came out,none of these have logged on their PKs.On the other hand,lately we have recruited many new members in the 35 to 45 range,and higher,where are they all coming from?No smarty remarks please.(I think i set myself up there,kinda,heh.).BUT,has anyone noticed just how many level 20 ogre sks in full guardian are out pking these days?Where the piss THEY coming from?Skyshrine is supposed to be harder now,its supposed to take more than 1 group to farm guardian now.I know I couldn't walk there and get a group.So what that proves is the high level guys still got their PK alts.<br />Give PoP time to get boring,PKing will come back to life soon.Hell,I'm not slowing down any.
