        <br><font face="verdana, sans-serif" size="2">
        The Lords of Law was created in response to the large
        number of random acts of violence (PKing) observed in
        various parts of Norrath (mainly in the Steamfont, Lesser
        Faydark and Greater Faydark zones). The purpose of the
        Lords of Law is to reduce the occurrence of such acts,
        both by providing protection for new or struggling
        players and by 'persuading' confirmed 'random' PKers to
        reform. Since EverQuest is largely a role-playing game,
        it is hoped that the purpose of the Lords of Law can be
        fulfilled in a manner that is both fun for Lords of Law
        (LoL) members and/or in a manner that is consistent with
        good role-playing. However, LoL members should be
        prepared to sacrifice both fun and good role-playing for
        short periods and to do what is necessary to rid Norrath
        of the most pernicious PKers.<br>
        <br>
        Before proceeding with guidelines on how to achieve the
        purpose set forth for the Lords of Law, let's set forth
        the definitions of some terms so that we are speaking a
        common language with the same meanings for words,<br>
        <br>
        <font face="verdana, sans-serif" size="2" color="#3300FF">Character--</font>A single
        character played in EQ, Never assume that all the
        characters played by a given person will behave the same.
        The crimes of one character do not spill over to other
        characters played by the same person. Nor do they spill
        over to the alignment, gender, race, class, faction or
        guild to which that character may belong.<br>
        <br>
        <font face="verdana, sans-serif" size="2" color="#3300FF">Random PKer:</font> This is a
        character who kills other characters in the game with no
        apparent reason. Examples, characters who haunt the
        beginning spawn sites to PK newbies, characters who hang
        around monster camps and when the player(s) are weak, PK
        them. Characters who declare the nearest race to
        'enemies' just to have a justification for PKing someone.
        We will also sometimes refer to a random PKer as simply a
        PKer. It must be understood though, that PKer means
        random PKer and does not refer to a non-random PKer.<br>
        <br>
        <font face="verdana, sans-serif" size="2" color="#3300FF">Non-random PKer: </font>This is a
        character who PKs other characters but for reason. This
        should include all members of Lords of Law. It also
        includes most members of Darkenbane who PK members of
        Light races but only under very controlled circumstances,
        circumstances which are consistent with good
        role-playing. Feuds between characters is another
        example. ANY Guild war PKing should be considered
        non-random.<br>
        <br>
        <font face="verdana, sans-serif" size="2" color="#3300FF">Good role-playing. </font>this is a
        hard one to define. I put it here mainly to point out
        that the rules that most people accept for good
        role-playing were defined for a game system where
        character death was just that, the (likely) permanent
        death of that character. EQ is different. To be an
        effective member of Lords of Law you need to understand
        and work with those differences.<br>
        <br>
        <font face="verdana, sans-serif" size="2" color="#3300FF">Hunt.</font> Systematically seeking
        out one or more known random PKers and killing them
        repeatedly. This is one of the primary duties of a member
        of LoL. Hunting, as defined above, should NEVER be
        carried out except against known random PKers.<br>
        <br>
        <font face="verdana, sans-serif" size="2" color="#3300FF">Guild war.</font> This the EQ
        system of formalized warfare between two guilds. During a
        Guild war, the two guilds involved cannot change their
        rosters---add or remove members.<br>
        <br>
        <font face="verdana, sans-serif" size="2" color="#3300FF">Guild hunt.</font> This is a hunt,
        as defined above, applied to any and all members of a
        certain guild. Only the Lords of Law guild leader may
        declare a guild hunt.<br>
        <br>
        <font face="verdana, sans-serif" size="2" color="#3300FF">Guidelines:</font><br>
        <br>
        <font face="verdana, sans-serif" size="2" color="#3300FF">1. Identifying random PKers </font><br>
        <br>
        Lords of Law maintains a list of known random PKers. It
        is the duty of LoL members to see to it that this list
        updated with new characters who are clearly random PKers
        and also to have removed characters that have reformed.
        When submitting someone to the list of random PKers,
        NEVER submit a name given to you by one character. In
        most cases you should witness the random PKer at least
        attempting this crime once yourself before submitting the
        characters name, preferably either more than once or
        against more than one other character. ALWAYS be prepared
        to admit a mistake and ask for that characters removal
        from the list if it is discovered that the 'random PKing'
        was really something else---retaliation for another
        PKing, feud, guild war, etc.<br>
        <br>
        <font face="verdana, sans-serif" size="2" color="#3300FF">2. Hunting </font><br>
        <br>
        Recall that hunting is something we only do against
        random PKers, never for any other reason. When hunting a
        random PKer(s) the goal should be to make on-line life so
        miserable for that character that the character reforms
        or the player playing that character finds it more
        rewarding to play a different character or do something
        else entirely. To further that goal, he re is very little
        within the game that is discouraged or considered
        out-of-bounds for L0L members 'hunting'. PK the random
        PKer frequently and often. Take loot him, most valuable
        items first. Take their experience if you can. If you
        can't take it directly seek the help of those who can
        (whether they belong ot LoL or not). Loot taken from
        during hunts should either go to the guild treasury or to
        non Lords of Law participants in the hunt. (We do not
        want the APPEARANCE of hunting for our own personal
        (profit.) If you are told that a certain item used to
        belong to a victim of the PKer, return it to its original
        owner. There are some restrictions however. Do NOT 'camp'
        the PKers body. It is certainly understandable for you to
        still be in the vicinity of his body upon his return if
        you are still battling other characters in the area. If
        his return is very rapid (his respawn point is nearby and
        he comes back very quickly), it is reasonable for you to
        still be in the area. But if he is killed a second time
        and there is no more fighting going on, LEAVE! Reports of
        'camping' a PKers body, can get a member removed from
        Lords of Law.<br>
        <br>
        During the course of a hunt you will frequently be
        questioned or attacked by characters near the character
        you are hunting. NEVER retaliate against these
        characters--although you may defend yourself without
        explanation ONCE. DO explain your actions to these
        characters. Explain why you are hunting the character you
        attacked, explain that you are a member of Lords of Law
        ant that it is your DUTY to hunt this character. If they
        doubt your claims of the villainy of the character you
        were hunting, try to provide them with a reference
        (another character, preferably outside LoL, who can
        verify this character's villainy). If these other
        characters continue to attack you after the explanation
        has been offered, you are then free to retaliate.
        However, do not immediately submit their names as random
        PKers. See the notes below on Guild hunt for info on what
        to do about them. Lords of Law will observe
        &quot;non-PK&quot; zones, such as Unrest. This is
        somewhat counter to the overall purpose but is in keeping
        with our 'law-keeping' role.<br>
        <br>
        <font face="verdana, sans-serif" size="2" color="#3300FF">3. Guildhunt<br>
        </font><br>
        Under certain conditions Lords of Law may wind up hunting
        an entire guild. This should only happen when either the
        guild engages in random PKing as a matter of policy OR a
        majority of the guild members are random PKers and the
        remainder of the guild defends those members when we hunt
        them. A guild hunt may only be declared by the guild
        leader of Lords of Law or, in his absence, his appointed
        replacement. Prior to declaring a guild hunt the Lords of
        Law guild leader should consult with the guild leader of
        the target guild and explain why the guild hunt is being
        declared and how the guild hunt can be ended. There are
        three ways a guild hunt can end.<br>
        <br>
        i) The leader of the opposing guild announces that the
        random PKing practices of his guild are no longer
        supported by the guild. Any future acts of random PKing
        by members of his guild will either result in the members
        removal or at least will result in that member not being
        defended by his guild when LoL hunts him for his crimes.
        ii) It is no longer true that a majority of the members
        of the guild are random PKers. Whether this is achieved
        by the guild removing PKers from its roster or not, is
        not relevant.<br>
        <br>
        iii) The Lords of Law guild leader can declare an end to
        a guild hunt when he believes that its continuation is
        not in the best interests of LoL. Hopefully, this would
        be under circumstances such as the guild has become so
        small and powerless, that they no longer pose a serious
        threat. But this could happen if a bigger threat arose,
        some change in EQ rules required it or some dispute
        within LoL made this desirable.<br>
        <br>
        iiii) Guild hunt always applies to a guild, never the
        members. That is, once a player leaves a guild that we
        have targeted for guild hunt, they have a 'clean slate'
        and must earn the title of 'random Pker' anew in order
        for us to hunt them. Members of a guild that is being
        hunted should have this explained to them individually as
        well as to their guild leader before the guild hunt is
        declared by the LoL guild leader. Invite members of a
        guild being hunted to leave that guild frequently and
        often.<br>
        <br>
        <font face="verdana, sans-serif" size="2" color="#3300FF">4. Guild war<br>
        </font><br>
        This is a formal EQ war with another guild. This can be
        great fun for both sides with lots of opportunity for
        role-playing, etc. Guild wars are for guilds whom we,
        Lords of Law, respect. So this is not something we would
        do instead of a guild hunt. In fact, since Guild war
        precludes changing the guild rosters (characters entering
        or leaving a guild), guildwars should not be undertaken
        while a guild hunt is in progress.<br>
        <br>
        Guild wars are NOT guild hunts! One should always treat
        the members of the other guild in guilder with chivalry
        and honor. Do NOT hunt them, Outside of large organized
        battles, kill them only once. If you loot them at all,
        take only money. Do not deliberately take their
        experience.<br>
        <br>
        <font face="verdana, sans-serif" size="2" color="#3300FF">Summary:<br>
        </font><br>
        Do pursue known random PKers relentlessly and without
        mercy.<br>
        <br>
        Do grant mercy to those PKers who have reformed, unless
        you catch them again PKing randomly.<br>
        <br>
        Do aid new players or others being troubled by PKers.<br>
        <br>
        Do give away loot taken from hunting random PKers, either
        to their victims, to people aiding you in hunting them or
        to the guild treasury.<br>
        <br>
        Do NOT camp bodies. Period.<br>
        <br>
        Do NOT easily condemn someone as a random PKer. Get your
        facts straight first. What we plan to do to PKers IS NOT
        NICE, so be certain before you bring a character's name
        to the guild as a random PKer.<br>
        <br>
        Do NOT name a character a random PKer just because they
        PKed you, even repeatedly. This could simply be
        'role-playing' on their part. A single victim, even if it
        is you, is not enough to brand a character 'random PKer'.
        This one deserves an example. Cadric was PKed by
        Temporalis. She took his sash, which is a VERY bad thing
        to do to a monk---deep insult and all that. That act, by
        itself, is not enough to brand Temporalis as a 'random
        PKer'. That is not to say that Cadric could not or should
        not pursue his own, personal, revenge. He certainly
        should. But that act alone does not warrant the full
        wrath of Lords of Law.<br>
        <br>
        Do give due honor and respect to the non-random PKers we
        find, whether in a guild or not.<br>
        <br>
        Do NOT drag LoL into personal feuds and disputes.<br>
        <br>
        Do tell non-LoL members of the reasons for hunting a
        particular 'random PKer' or guild.<br>
        <br>
        Do tell prospective guild members about both our purpose
        and the guidelines above. In fact, new members should
        probably be required to read these guidelines and be
        prepared to answer questions about them on-line before
        being invited into the guild.<br>
        <br>
        Do tell the guild leader or nearest available officer if
        you see another LoL member acting in violation of these
        guidelines.<br></font>
