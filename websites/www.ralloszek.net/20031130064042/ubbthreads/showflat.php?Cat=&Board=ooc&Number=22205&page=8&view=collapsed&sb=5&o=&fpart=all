<a href="http://eq.crgaming.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=4811" target="_blank">http://eq.crgaming.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=4811</a><br /><br />From EQLive:<br /><br />Development Update, Game Balance<br /><br />Just like everyone else, we're people. People make mistakes.<br /><br />Some mistakes aren't that unbalancing and are safe to keep in the game and work around. Others can sometimes yield gameplay that turns out to be even more fun than developers even imagined, as ingenious adventurers discover unrealized potential in their abilities.  Yet others, even the best-intentioned ones, can cause an entire style of gameplay to shift dramatically in a direction that no one particularly enjoys.  <br /><br />Unfortunately, today, we need to address a number of the latter kind.  For that, we sincerely apologize. It is absolutely our fault that certain abilities have been allowed to grow out of control.<br /><br />In our last letter, we stated that our goal for large scale battles in EverQuest was never one of endurance contests. We'd prefer to actively return to the type of battles that everyone feels are more fun - Battles that require tactics and skill, as opposed to attendance and endurance.<br /><br />Due to some specific abilities as they exist today in EverQuest, this unfortunately isn't possible. The mathematics simply cannot be made to work. In extreme cases such as that, the abilities themselves must be altered.<br /><br />It isn't possible, for example, to ever make another fast-action, do-or-die-quickly style encounter as long as Manaburn exists in its current form, unless it is targeted solely at an entire group of people who have this ability, as it will otherwise be trivial to those who do.<br /><br />Likewise, it isn't possible to create encounters that must be completed in a certain amount of time due to mana consumption, when Rods of Mystical Transvergence provide an essentially unlimited source of mana. Every challenging encounter must also be challenging for the massive raid of people who have infinite mana, and the encounter then becomes undoable to those who do not have the infinite supply.<br /><br />Hypothetically, the only alternative to changing abilities such as these would be to inflate every other class up to the same tier of relative power (be it damaging power, or mana regenerative power), then inflate the rest of the world to compensate for the sudden rash of new found power. Drastic, world-wide changes of that sort, however, are a guaranteed way to do more harm than good.<br /><br />The time has come to address these abilities. Fortunately, after doing so, EverQuest as a whole, and the encounters in Planes of Power, will be able to be tuned for forces who are interested in active participation in the game, as opposed to those forced to sit through yet another 45 minute encounter with a single NPC, as became the norm in Luclin.<br /><br /><br />* Manaburn. In addition to the problem described above, this ability was never intended to be a way for small bands of high level players to hold hostage the advancement of larger numbers of more appropriately leveled people. While this was not the universal case, it has unfortunately happened enough across most servers to where it became a large concern in recent months.  The concept of someone looking to complete their epic quest via teamwork and overcoming the odds, only to have their attempts obstructed, in some cases, by small teams of players looking to profit financially from their power, quite frankly, is not a behavior that we wish the game to reinforce.<br /><br />In the next patch, Wizards who have purchased Manaburn will find that their ability points have been refunded. Please make sure that you have fewer than 25 pooled Ability points.<br /><br />At that point, they will be able to purchase a new Manaburn if they choose, which has most of the power of the old one. However, the new Manaburn leaves a temporary effect on its target when used that  does not stack with other Manaburns.  The delay that we will be tuning on the Test Server soon will allow a single target to be manaburned no more frequently than once every minute. <br /><br />Hopefully, this will bring the ability back in line with the original intent -- A powerful ability that allows a Wizard to do massive short-term damage, but not a method for a group of wizards to destroy powerful creatures with zero risk. <br /><br /><br />* Rods of Mystical Transvergence. The description above shows how this spell has perhaps singlehandedly altered the balance of the end-game encounter by turning it into an event where the largest challenge is setting up a timed rotation of Complete Healing.  Once that is established, in many cases, the event is just as playable by leaving AutoAttack on, and wandering away to watch television. This does not make for stellar interactive content.<br /><br />We view Magicians as an excellent source of damage, especially with the many pet enhancements that have been made over the past year. To be honest, it is a more than a small shame that their full energies have been viewed as "needed" to be spent, full-time, purely on transferring their mana to others. Magicians are supposed to be the masters of elemental conjuration and highly respected as a damage-dealer, not the masters of mana transferrence.<br /><br />In the next update, Rods of Mystical Transvergence will be changed so that the spell summons an item that is still a valuable upgrade over the original Modulation Rod, yet does not provide an infinite amount of mana.  The idea of sudden mana gain spells is only balanced if there is a net loss over time to counteract the rapid infusion.  The initial version of the spell that we will be testing summons a Rod containing a single charge of 360 mana for 450 hit points, and can only be used by a person once each minute.<br /><br />In addition, the Rods themselves will be non-droppable, and spell will turn into a "target based summon," such that the Magician summons them directly onto the recipient, as opposed to having to hand them out manually or create a stockpile on the ground.<br /><br />Since there are definitely encounters in the game where this type of mana regeneration is mandatory for the encounter to be beaten by a reasonably sized force, a number of those encounters will likewise be re-tuned to shorten their duration, most frequently by lowering the hit points on the NPC in question.<br /><br />Again, our intent here is provide Magicians with a desirable secondary ability that would ideally be used before a battle, not an ability which essentially compels them to suddenly transform into a full-time support role, transferring their mana to others, as opposed to dealing damage. <br /><br /><br />* Complete Healing. The concept of any class getting their single best, most efficient primary ability at level 39, has never sat well with most people. In the days of characters having a maximum of 2000-4000 hit points, the spell was absolutely not imbalancing. However, as time went on and characters progressed, now doubling that amount of hit points, it becomes obvious that the spell must be scaled back slightly.<br /><br />This spell has, over time, become the defining cornerstone of the Cleric class. As such, it cannot be altered significantly. Taking that into account, and given that those with the most hit points in EverQuest have yet to hit the full 10,000 HP cap of this spell, the spell will remain nearly as useful as it is today, by being reclassified as a spell that heals for 7,500 hit points, down from its current cap of 10,000.<br /><br />This will allow it to continue to be used as it has been in the past, while allowing for more dynamic types of heals to be introduced in the future. Making this change will allow us to providing more entertaining high-end encounters that require more active involvement than setting up a Complete Healing "Rotation" or "Chain," then repeating the same motions until the Large Thing you are facing, eventually falls down.<br /><br /><br />* Monk Defense.  Finally, the issue of defensive ability needs to be addressed with respect to Monks.  Monks in EverQuest were originally intended to be a class with excellent offensive potential, both with and without equipment.  This ability came at the expense of having only passable defensive abilities, partially in the form of an extremely small, restrictive selection of equipment from which to choose.  <br /><br />This, of course, caused its own series of problems of how to adequately reward the person behind the character.  It did not take long for universally equippable items (ALL/ALL items) to be considered by and large as "Monk Loot," as far back as before the launch of Kunark.<br /><br />Over time, Monks' defensive abilities had been tuned up to correct a perceived weakness.  This, taken in combination with a few years of universally equippable, low-weight, high powered items entering the game, slowly transformed Monks into what is arguably the strongest defensive class in the game.  Monks get hit less than any other class, and due to the tuning over time, no longer take appreciably more damage when they do get hit.<br /><br />This imbalance between the classes does need to be addressed in order for the Plate-wearing classes in the game to have their proper relative power.  The Plate-wearing classes in the game take a serious penalty to their offensive abilities in order to defend as well as they can, and we cannot fix this problem solely by inflating their defensive abilities to compensate for this.  Again, that type of change would harm EverQuest as a whole much more than altering the one class.  Likewise, we have no desire to retroactively alter all of the equipment in the game that is contributing to this problem.  <br /><br />Monk defense will be altered somewhat.  It is no secret that in EverQuest, a character's Armor Class does not compare equally across different classes.  (A Wizard with 1000 AC defends differently than a Warrior with 1000AC, for example.)  It's not the most optimal system, for sure, but it is the one that many people have had much time to get used to.  As such, Monk defense will be altered such that they may continue wearing the same equipment, however, they will get a decreased benefit to their overall ability to take damage.<br /><br />Again, we have no desire to make monks unable to take any type of punishment -- far from it.  What we are primarily striving for is maintaining the defensive order of the Plate classes being able to take the most punishment, followed by the Chain classes and Monks.  The latter being technically a Leather wearing class who will continue to make up the difference by being able to avoid more blows than the rest.<br /><br />In closing, we would like to again apologize for the amount of time that we've allowed these abilites to remain in their current state. With Planes of Power on the horizon, in order to make encounters that most people would consider "fun," these abilities and class attributes need to be brought back into line as sane upgrades and logical progressions, as opposed to their current manifestations.<br /><br />We appreciate the many well thought-out letters that have been sent in on these topics and more.  As always, we thank you for playing EverQuest and look forward to seeing you soon in the Planes of Power.<br /><br />- The EverQuest Development Team<br />

Chesticus, it is the way he conducts himself with other people, and the way he trys to drag down others, he is a bully in game. His Unwanted/needed comments are often heard in Sebilis zone. He presents himself as a holier than though Person beyond approach. People Like these are idiots. Really I have nothing against his Cut and paste Job, if he wants to be a monkey I don't mind. I do mind his attitude torwads others, and the way He conducts himself.

You can feel free to stfu now anyway. I was at his desk when  <b><i>I</b></i> copied and pasted that. I forgot he has an account here, so I figured it was signed in under my name and didn't think anything else of it until now.<br />The difference between Jyleel and myself is that that he doesn't give a shit who likes or dislikes him. The fact that you posted that here, under an anonymous name which gives not even so much as a clue who your characters are... that says a lot more about you than it does about him any-damn-way. Be proud to be a prick, and if you want to talk shit about someone, don't be afraid to do so while letting them know who you are, and subjecting yourself to the same kind of criticism.<br /><br />Ever notice that it's almost always the green OOR alts or the anonymous poster on a message board... in each case not revealing their identity... who has the MOST to say? /sigh<br /><br />

Who cares if he is an ass, who cares if he is an idiot? He posted a message that he found from the Development team at Sony that was relevant to the game and the way the game is about to change. If he hadn't posted it, i would NOT have seen it. i don't troll the Developer's Corner on sony's main website, nor do I visit Casters Real very often. So I am grateful that the person posted it here for us to see.<br /><br />How that makes the person an idiot, I do NOT understand.<br />

Hey Nnuk, I have yet to see you in any zone other then the Nexus/Bazaar and Everfrost/Permafrost.<br /><br />Fucking pissant.<br /><br />When you decide to explore zones on RZ other then those, then you have the right to declare everyone else who plays EQ in all the other zones "peasants".  Seems 90% of RZ has more balls then you.<br /><br />Until then, you're nothing but atmosphere/landscape of 4 zones.<br /><br />Now, hit me with your "I'm more intelligent then you because....because!" shit.  Play the game outside of 4 zones, venture a bit.  I don't think I've ever seen a p.o.s. pker that talks so much shit yet never ventures outside of ice giants in Everfrost.  <br /><br /><br /><br />

I always love it when anti's claim that the only time they see me is when I'm in nexus/bazaar :-)  My bind point is in nexus, so it's usually where I start out every time I log on.  It's silly to say that someone spends too much time in the bazaar/nexus because when you see those people there you are sitting in the exact same zone yourself.  People use nexus for raid/group coordination and I being a melee use the nexus to travel.  So if you see me sitting waiting for some friends or waiting for the nexus I <i>must</i> be avoiding pvp according to your logic, right Kyleigh?<br /><br />Oh and I would tread very lightly in MIM if I were you, I have friends in that guild just  <i>waiting</i>  for you to fuck up :-)<br /><br />/wave<br /><br />-Hamadryad<br />Artist of Death

Wow you guys are so SMART! Since I'm often with Nnuk her comment applies to me aswell.  Molech you seem to think I want attention and yet ALL you ever do is troll boards and flame people.

<blockquote><font class="small">So speaketh Hamadryad:</font><hr> You're the biggest moron to ever get turned down by a chick and throw a tempter tantrum~ <hr /></blockquote><br /><br />The fact you think I was somehow turned down by you online... amazes me.  It only goes to prove my point that you're starved for attention.  Hence, my previous post.  You shouldn't flatter yourself, you're a stupid canuck that has your head so far up your ass that you should have affixiated years ago.<br /><br />The only image you have to uphold is that of a slut, and you're doing a very good job maintaining that one.<br /><br />For those who care enough to view our discussion... here is the original message I sent.<br /><br />"Hello Katie. You don't mind me scaring off all these little boys trying to hook up with ya, do you? It's amusing to me, reading posts from people such as Nedrian. I can imagine the private messages you must receive. If there is anything you need just let me know. My services are hard to come by. You can't find someone in such a field, they have to find you. Halten Sie mich fr einen Wchterengel. Oder mglicherweise ein dunkler Engel, der versucht, Schadenersatz fr seine Sins zu bilden"<br /><br />She seems to think that was coming onto her in some way... and this was my reply.<br /><br />"Yes, that is my coming onto you... lol. Thank you for clarifying my point. My field of work, if you are too dense to realize, involves network security. That said, I offer services to certain people. I figure, hey this bitch has a lot of internet creeps lurking around. My skills can be well used... for a price. Translate the last portion if you like, you'll notice it all fits together."<br /><br />These posts were copied from the Artful Death message board.<br /><br />So thats how I come onto people, Katie?  I would have expected some flattery or something along that line.  Stupid ass, please reply and further support my statements.

Okay just understand that you were creeping me out.  How else do you expect me to respond to a message like that?  And then saying something in german?  You sounded like a stereotypical internet weirdo, maybe I wouldn't have been freaked out if you had just said hi hows it going.  I'm not a complicated person there's no need to speak to me in german to get me interested in a conversation.  But calling me an attention whore and names on a message board is apt to simply make me defensive and make me think you are even weirder.  <br /><br />When it comes to security I'm not important enough nor known enough for someone to try to hack me, also I'm behind a firewall at my school aswell as some crazy program Nnuk set me up with.  If you were just offering to help me with that than I'm sorry for misjudging you, but I have had some bad experiences with creeps on the internet. <br /><br />-Hamadryad<br />Artful Death  <br /><br />ps: And why are you using my real name?  My name on these boards is Ham.

I'd say that anyone that wants a good laugh should go to the Artful Death board and read the whole Molech ( which is Equinoxe ) embarrassment.  Just be careful.

"<i>Hey Nnuk</i>"<br /><br />I just love it when they scream out my name... It's so gratifying!<br /><br /><br />"<i>I have yet to see you in any zone other then the Nexus/Bazaar and Everfrost/Permafrost.</i>"<br /><br />Let us set aside the fact that the only thing you've ever done when seeing me in EF was zone (when in range) or prattle on endlessly (when OOR green/red) for a moment...<br /><br />As can be evidenced by the significant number of people hunting Ice Giants these days... It's fairly obvious that I have not been in EverFrost as much -- In fact (until recently) I'd not set foot in EverFrost for several months as I've been on Luclin. Scarlet Desert and Katta had a rather attractive pool of potential models -- Did you miss the Comet Nosce thread?<br /><br />Regarding the Nexus/Bazaar... This has become a rather popular bit of propaganda from the bluebie horde -- I'll address it in another thread since I'd not want that to detract from the main point of this post (which is a big ole "Fuck you!" in your honor, m'lady).<br /><br /><br />"<i>Now, hit me with your "I'm more intelligent then you because....because!" shit.</i>"<br /><br />Any thinking person can see what the "because" is for themselves so there's really no need for me to do so.<br /><br /><br />"<i>Seems 90% of RZ has more balls then you.</i>"<br /><br />Screaming my name.. Fantasies about my testes -- Please get yourself under control before you ruin your chair, m'lady.<br /><br />Tell me... Would you stop obsessing over me if I gave you an autograph?<br /><br />Put your shirt back on! I am not signing your breast... How about one of those empty gin bottles under your desk instead?<br /><br />On another note... It is interesting that you'd choose today to go into "psycho mode" -- I'd just put up a new poll over at AD.Com and, believe it or not, a few people asked me if you were the psycho-banshee in question. ;-)<br /><br />Artfully Yours,<br /><br /><a href="http://www.artfuldeath.com" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.artfuldeath.com/galleries_current/nnuk/misc/posts/sigs/nnuk01_rz.gif"></a><br /><br />ps Oh yeah... Illusive.<br /><br />"<i>So Nnuk, what does it feel like to be a perfect-match steriotype(MENSA Troll)?</i>"<br /><br />I thought I'd covered this in an amusing manner elsewhere but, for some incomprehensible reason, you seem to be sticking to this as if you had some kind of point.<br /><br />[shrugs]<br /><br />Here's a quote from the description...<br /><br />"<b>Under NO circumstances should the MENSA Troll respond to anybody's criticisms of him</b>"<br /><br />I doubt there are any longtime regular readers who are unaware that 90% of my posts are responses to people criticizing me -- Including this one.<br /><br />I (Nnuk) am an Erudite and, as such, it is perfectly natural for me to be a pompous egomaniac. Get with the program, would ya?<br /><br />I (Peter) may not be MENSA material... But even a chimpanzee can appear as brilliant as Einstein when surrounded by baboons.

Are you honestly proud of being able to kill people in Scarlet Desert?  Those are the people that in bazaar have to pay 100 pp to get a C3, those are people who have never even been to a large scale raid...  Anyone who is not level 60 on RZ right now and not a PK is either a newbie or an ALT, even the very very casual player who was on the server from the start has hit level 60, of course since you consciously decide to stay behind on the levelling curve you know this very well.<br /><br />If you wish to prove that you are not the ganker that everyone thinks you are, why not take me up on the pvp challenge?  I am sure I'd get a chucke or two.

I was probably wasting the last 5 minutes before I had to go to class or something and whacking people who zoned out of nexus.  *shrug*  If 5 people jump me obviously I'm not gonna stick around.<br /><br />Mearis .... can you please tell me what zones ARE okay to pvp in?  Sounds to me like you should go to a blue server!  (Okay that line is clich but she complains about EVERY zone being unfair or not suitable for pvp)<br /><br />-Hamadryad<br />Artful Death

EF is an OK zone to pvp in, but one that is very heavily skewed towards casters with levitation, like most outdoor zones.  I will duel any pure melee who won't use a 100k horse in GD and win by default simply because levitation is a bitch to deal with as a melee.

Mearis...I'm sorry to say that some classes have advantages in certain zones.  Some people have faction advantages, some people have the advantage of levitation.  People are ALWAYS going to have advantages over you, and sometimes you will have the advantage.  It's learning to deal with any situation and come through with an occasional victory in a situation where you MIGHT not stand on equal grounds with your opponent that makes you a pvper.  Just because someone on occasion fights where he/she has an advantage doesn't make them LAME.  I think you would come up with any excuse to call my friends lame though.  "Oh you pvp in Scarlet Desert?  THATS LAME! Come fight me in the ARENA where everything is perfectly controlled!"  Sorry but that's not the way everquest works, and if you win a duel it doesn't mean shit on Rallos.<br /><br />-Hamadryad<br />Artful Death<br />

Hocho I fought some of your guildmates in Skyfire about two weeks ago, Me Cougr and Nnuk attacked a group of four of you, we took a few casualties and so did you guys.  You guys called in a level 60 wizard who deleveled to 59 just for me (awww) And I just decided to leave (Cougr and Nnuk were gone at this point). I would say I'm in the bazaar 3% of the time when I'm on Rallos, and other time's I'm always out doing stuff.  That "stuff" probably doesn't involve sitting in A_Randomantiinfested_dungeon where you hang out, so excuse me for not trying super hard to run into YOU specifically to prove something retarded anyways.  Who gives a fuck how much time someone spends where, you would still run in a 1 vs 1 against me or call in an OOR healer/delevel a manaburn wizard like your guildmates did.<br /><br />-Hamadryad<br />Artful Death    <br /><br />Edit: I'm awful with names, sorry I forgot you were the rogue I was fighting :P

Please supply the name of the deleveled Wizard?  <br /><br />Do you seriously not remember the fact that you zoned at a bub, when it was one on one not 2 weeks ago?  And as far as the PVP with my guildmates...from what I heard, you plugged twice, guznuk died, and your wizards were left to fend for themselves, which they didn't do very well.  Both sides are heresay, so we'll leave that as it is.  <br /><br />Like I said, perhaps when you get back...we'll play some more.

It wasn't just you and me Hocho, and you know it.  It was you, me, and that cleric named Warchild in Revered, and the bard you had debuffing me while you were meleeing me, aswell as the druid and wizard you called in.  And ALL of you couldn't kill me!  I just ran through Lake of Ill Omen, back around to Dreadlands and pvped at Karnors for a bit before logging at the spires for a pickup the next day.  Sheesh.  I stuck around when it was just you and the bard but expecting me to stay to die pretty much when you called in even more people and after Warchild healed you a bunch....well you're just being silly.<br /><br />-Hamadryad<br />Artful Death

OK...wtf are you talking about?  Are we on the same page here?<br /><br />Netherbian Lair, me, you, 4 snares and 4 bubs of life later, you were in the bazaar.  No one else was involved until you were already at 2 bubs of life...and I for sure, didn't need to call anyone else.  Spin your chatter elsewhere...I ain't buyin.

"<i>And as far as the PVP with my guildmates...from what I heard blah blah blah</i>"<br /><br />What you heard, dear fellow, was wrong -- As you can plainly see... It was just Cougr, Hammy and myself:<br /><br /><img src="http://www.artfuldeath.com/galleries_current/nnuk/portraits/arroas_01_athosblack_01.jpg"><br /><br />I was the only casualty...

Here is a link to  <a href="http://boards.gamers.com/messages/message_view.asp?name=lvpublic&amp;id=zzqnx" target="_blank">the complete thread</a> but here's the Reader's Digest version:<br /><br />Order of Defiance was having a raid when MiM flexed their UberMuscles and took over.<br /><br />One of their (OoD) members had the balls to stand up to 'em (MiM) but, in the end, they (OoD) hung him out to dry and not only apologized to MiM (ie: Is my anus not tight enough for you? I'm sooooo sorry! Here.. Let me clench!!!) but paid a 10,000 pp peace offering and forced their own member to destroy some piece of No Drop UberEquipment.<br /><br />Shit talking from OoD members is to be taken with a grain of salt. ;-)<br /><br />Artfully Yours,<br /><br /><a href="http://www.artfuldeath.com" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.artfuldeath.com/galleries_current/nnuk/misc/posts/sigs/nnuk01_rz.gif"></a>

Ahh yes, the SF ordeal...Hama, I see our wires were crossed.  My apologies for assuming you were intentially dodging.<br /><br />And tossing up stuff about my guild is very classy...I suppose that in the same manner I could discount your entire guild's "l33t PVP prowess" by saying that your members run to Legends? /wave Hama<br /><br />&lt;shrug&gt; I can't represent my entire guild, nor can you...but nice evasion nonetheless.

Those are the people that in bazaar have to pay 100 pp to get a C3, those are people who have never even been to a large scale raid... Anyone who is not level 60 on RZ right now and not a PK is either a newbie or an ALT, even the very very casual player who was on the server from the start has hit level 60<hr /></blockquote><br /><br />Mearis, I like you alot and consider you a good friend, but good lord you spew some idiotic bullshit sometimes. This paragraph sums it up to a T. Maybe if you get your nose out of the air  then you would know that there are plenty of people who arent "newbies" and "alts" that arent 60th and in some l33t VT raiding guild. In fact I can name a few that started on RZ the day EQ opened(and were in beta before that) that arent 60th. That play regularly, and have consistently since before you conceived of the name "Meearsbepointy". Get over yourself.

Lova you are also a PK... thanks for proving my point.<br /><br />Danil, I know there are people who started at the beginning of the server and are not level 60, but what % of those people didn't take a long break of switch characters?  Be honest here, how many of your friends since release who played even very casually all the way through are not 60?<br /><br />Defining me a powergamer is fairly hilarious, considering I am by FAR the oldest level 60 mage on RZ without his epic, and I am in a guild which is as diametrically opposite from a raid guild as you can imagine.

The people I am thinking of did not indeed take long breaks in between characters.. fook Haji has been 60th for all of 3 weeks, and is probably among the oldest 10 monks on RZ. Elayne is 56th druid, never had a serious alt or any "long breaks"(cept for the month or so we played DAoC last year). <br /><br />Claiming that everyone who isnt 60th is a pk, a newbie to rz or an alt is as absurd as claiming that anyone who is 60th must be some obsessed shut-in powergaming loser with pasty white skin and an obsessive hatred of the sun. Neither statement even approaches any kinda of close approximation of the truth.(which isnt to say that a)there arent people who arent 60th who are alts, pks or newbies and b)that there arent 60th who arent as white as paper and hate the sun =p)

No I stand by my original stance, Jyleel sucks big time. Equinoxe put it good though. Jyleel is a llama, no I don't subcribe to anti vs Pk crap, I kill when I feel like it and don't when I don't I run solo. The anti vs pk is both hillarious and sad. As for you admitting to sharring accounts last time I checked isn't that Illegal? I repeat I repeat Jyleel sucks. it's amazing how he doesn't even respond, no instead he sends his bitch of a wife to do his dirty work lol. Oh and when you do quote something quote it all or nothing, taking things out of context weakens your stance horribly.
