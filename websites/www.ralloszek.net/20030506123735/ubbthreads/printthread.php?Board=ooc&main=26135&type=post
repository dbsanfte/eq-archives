So if I am to understand Tuskadon's position... The heart and soul of PKing on Rallos Zek hinged upon RoP and LV? Jesus H Christ -- What a load of poppycock.<br /><br />Straight PKing took a major downturn well over a year ago -- I got bored with EQ so Norrath's artistic presence declined. Vova left the server and, shortly thereafter, the faction of semi-serious Flowers ceased to exist and finally, HiV split up.<br /><br />And ya know what, Tusk? Dess was kissing evil ass on Sullon at the time. LV had just started killing a few peeps here and there as a wannabe HiV. And, finally, you were still a lowbie ANTI paladin talking [censored] to various PKs on this board when all this was going down so take that prissy "I'm lvl XX and am teh L337 vet PK" attitude and shove it as far up your rectum as possible because you don't know [censored] from shinola, buddy.<br /><br />The instant a so-called PK starts worrying more about levels/gear is the moment his ass turns blue and he loses any credibility as far as being a PK spokesman goes.<br /><br />And, as a sidenote, I have a shitload more respect for the level 20-30 CAREER PKs than I do for raid guilds that pretend to be PKs because they've killed a coupla peeps and have a leader that can talk a good line of [censored].<br /><br />In summation -- PKing may be dead in certain level ranges... But it sure as Hell didn't die because Dessimus and/or Mangar left RZ. And in the event that you're wondering why I believe my opinion to be more important than yours -- Well that's because it is.<br /><br />Artfully Yours,<br /><br />Nnuk<br />Master of the Arts<br /><a href="http://www.artfuldeath.com" target="_blank">Artful Death Gallery</a><br /><br />ps My thanks to Malvolin for the kind words. An enlightened soul if ever there was one!  <img src="/ubbthreads/images/graemlins/grin.gif" alt="" />
