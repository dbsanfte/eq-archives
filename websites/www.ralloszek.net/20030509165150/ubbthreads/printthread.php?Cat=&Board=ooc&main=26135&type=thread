So if I am to understand Tuskadon's position... The heart and soul of PKing on Rallos Zek hinged upon RoP and LV? Jesus H Christ -- What a load of poppycock.<br /><br />Straight PKing took a major downturn well over a year ago -- I got bored with EQ so Norrath's artistic presence declined. Vova left the server and, shortly thereafter, the faction of semi-serious Flowers ceased to exist and finally, HiV split up.<br /><br />And ya know what, Tusk? Dess was kissing evil ass on Sullon at the time. LV had just started killing a few peeps here and there as a wannabe HiV. And, finally, you were still a lowbie ANTI paladin talking [censored] to various PKs on this board when all this was going down so take that prissy "I'm lvl XX and am teh L337 vet PK" attitude and shove it as far up your rectum as possible because you don't know [censored] from shinola, buddy.<br /><br />The instant a so-called PK starts worrying more about levels/gear is the moment his ass turns blue and he loses any credibility as far as being a PK spokesman goes.<br /><br />And, as a sidenote, I have a shitload more respect for the level 20-30 CAREER PKs than I do for raid guilds that pretend to be PKs because they've killed a coupla peeps and have a leader that can talk a good line of [censored].<br /><br />In summation -- PKing may be dead in certain level ranges... But it sure as Hell didn't die because Dessimus and/or Mangar left RZ. And in the event that you're wondering why I believe my opinion to be more important than yours -- Well that's because it is.<br /><br />Artfully Yours,<br /><br />Nnuk<br />Master of the Arts<br /><a href="http://www.artfuldeath.com" target="_blank">Artful Death Gallery</a><br /><br />ps My thanks to Malvolin for the kind words.

I fully agree. PKing isnt dead on Rallos at any level.<br /><br />I'm not sure what Tuskadon means by "high level" but, assuming he means 60+, I can say that I have had encounters *in one zone* with the following in the last few days..<br /><br />Hateraid<br />Kirby<br />Aevanne<br />Vodiar<br />Nimbas<br />Scailed<br />Flawlex<br />.. and I think Psycholistic too, but that may have been a week or so back.<br /><br />That is in *one* zone, without looking for pvp, it just came. And no, I don't hate any of the above.. I am on a PvP server and it breaks the monotony of AA grinding very nicely thank you <img src="/ubbthreads/images/graemlins/smile.gif" alt="" />. <br /><br />If he means mid-50s, the The Curse are very active - others too I'm sure (they are green, don't really know).<br /><br />There are also plenty of PKs at lower levels (as I know from my alts). PvP can be fun at all levels, the high-level game has never been the be-all and end-all, though it is different.<br /><br />Of course, if we are talking about the planes beyond tier 1, then there appears to be little PK activity there (some, but not a lot). PvP is still there though, as in the recent wars involving AD, Wudan and co. PoP and the flagging system and the introduction of more non-PvP zones hasnt helped, but people are adapting and I see a new generation coming through along with some older hands and a new batch from Legends.<br /><br />Maybe Tuskadon meant PvP on rallos was dead *for him*? Well, RoP never made much impact and I know he had high hopes. This "team PK" thing that Dessimus went on about was never a flier anyway, just a means to dangle off LV as far as I could see.<br /><br />New PK guilds are already becoming known.. life goes on.<br /><br />I too remember Tuskadon as being anti.. then he went PK. I only ever ran into him once on-line, and he didnt seem to play any active part in the battle that I could see (he was with a few other RoP). <br /><br />Ok, he has moved to Sullon, and that may well suit him better than Rallos. I hope so, it's a game and everyone should go where they enjoy it most. However, that doesn't place him in any position to comment on the state of PvP on Rallos... nothing died when he moved on except his hopes of becoming a "face" on Rallos.<br /><br />Riatsila<br />

PKing is far from dead he obviously is just leaving cause he cant take high lvl PvP, so let it be clear to all that Tuskadon who was once a decent PvPer is now a panty-wuss on SZ trying to PK with a lvl 7 nuetral gnome mage,how sad...But everyone changes and I guess.  RoP was never a high end PvP guild, They travled in numbers, you call that PvP? I sure dont, thats like ganking and exploiting.  I may have been with RoP for a few months but I still solo PK most of my kills (Id say 95 percent)  But if you are talking about 20 Pks V.S. 1 or 2 antis LV takes the cake on most sercumstances.  <br /> <br />     Maybe It is true that PvP is dead to Tusk but it will never die for me <img src="/ubbthreads/images/graemlins/grin.gif" alt="" /><br />

Too true Nnuk.<br /><br />Due to the mechanics of the game, item and equipment play an important role.  I chose to stay within the lower to mid range, because at this level, dmg caps are still in effect to a certain degree and mana/dmg ratio is pretty even across the casting classes.  My chanter will never be above 25, my cleric will never be above 35 and my other alts, well...they are comfortable where they are as well.<br /><br />With my 25 chanter, I can still bring down the twink melees with some preplanning and suprise tactics (AE Mes...mmmm..) and casters are still doable.<br /><br />PKing is not dead at all, it is merely just not popular.  I find that the majority of players on RZ are there because the high end game is not overpopulated like on other servers.

The heart and soul of PKing on Rallos Zek hinged on the PK's that made a difference on the server. I don't know about you but I never had any real concern for FoH, AD, or any other PK guild other than Darkenbane.<br /><br />Straight PKing didn't take a major downturn a year ago. Not unless you're counting Darkenbane leaving before that. HiV didn't die, they were absorbed by Lucid Vision and it was a well known fact that Lucid Vision was a PK guild before that even happened. LV and HiV actually did joint raids for a brief period of time before they decided to join us. That was around 4 months into our PK career. Your information is misleading and untrue. PKing didn't decline with Flowers of Happiness and Vova, whoever that is. Unless you were a lvl 1-20, no one really cared about that kind of guild, and neither did I.<br /><br />Also, to clarify, LV was never a "wannabe HiV". About a year and a half ago, LV went into Fear and found HiV there. Three of us killed 5 of them, and they petitioned us. Lyndro made us duel for the plane. Hey, we won. Not only did we win that duel, we won it in a matter of 30 seconds. We never aspired to be HiV. Reason being is because we *ALWAYS* thought they were beneath us. If anything, they should have aspired to be us, not the other way around. If you or anyone thinks thats an insult -- I'm merely stating facts. I didn't give a damn about HiV.<br /><br />The instant a so-called PK starts worrying more about levels/gear is the moment his ass turns blue and he loses any credibility as far as being a PK spokesman goes? You are aware of the fact that Hamadryad went to Legends to gear up and level, right? Who are you to determine what a "real" PK is and what a "phony" PK is? I cared about my gear and levels as a PK because I wanted to progress and compete with the best, and help my guild. Was I not a PK? Not for nothing, but if you ask the general population who had more of an impact on the server (and not message board jargon) -- they'll say Vasten &gt; Nnuk. Shoon &gt; Nnuk. Mangar &gt; Nnuk. Hamadryad &gt; Nnuk. Laroux &gt; Nnuk. Darkahn &gt; Nnuk. Timon &gt; Nnuk. Guznuk &gt; Nnuk. Tuggo &gt; Nnuk. Heck, man -- I'm just pulling names out of a hat here, but you get the idea. You can spout all your pretty little nonsense to your message board cronies for a year as a ghost, and thats all fine and dandy, but it remains absurdly untrue.<br /><br />It's great that you have respect for the level 20-30 career PK's. I have more respect for people that leveled into Manaburn range, crazy AA range, and all that jazz, though. That was LV. While you were having fun tinkering with newbies, the real killers kept on killing.<br /><br />Fact is, LV made more of an impact than HiV did, or your guild did. It's fine that you want to dispute whether or not PKing died with LV. I'm sure it didn't, but lets not tarnish its name because of your personal grudges, and lets not make some silly illusion about its history either.<br /><br />"... Can't get flagged for exping in UberZone01? Well cry me a river -- Go kill someone, goddammit."<br /><br />If you're lvl 50 wizard.. not sure which level you were, you'd have no concern about going to PoP and killing people there, because those people are too high level for you, but for people that were 60+ those zones tended to make a difference, simply because thats generally where everyone *WAS*. There isn't a whole lot of game in Everfrost these days, you know? If you want to evolve as a PK, you go where the people are. Consequently, its in a place where you need flags to enter. So, what do you do? You go get them because no place should be safe from all. And if you don't evolve, no one gives a hoot about you. And not to be really blunt about it but, sound familiar?<br />

... Diplomatic and tactful eluded you while you were furiously whacking your keyboard in a vain attempt at disputing what you thought I said instead of actually responding to what I did, in fact, say.<br /><br />[sigh]<br /><br />So be it...<br /><br />Impact, you say? That would depend upon how you define it.<br /><br />If your criteria is based solely upon killing some folks in a very specific level range... Congrats! I agree with you -- LV made a much larger impact upon a narrowly defined segment of the Rallos playerbase over the last year. Such feats haven't been seen since Legion of Legends went out of vogue.<br /><br />Now let's talk about Flowers. Even in their current form it would be ridiculous to try making a credible argument that they've had no impact upon RZ. Is there anyone on RZ that hasn't heard (or uttered) the phrase "GAH! u fukkin foh assholes SUCK!!!" on at least one occasion over the past few years? Hold an EQ Reunion 10 years from now and most present will have at least one Flower story to tell -- Unless Ruhi, Mearis or that monk guy with the "K" (Kuraki?) name shows up... Who the bloody Hell will be talking about you?<br /><br />As for my own inconsequential self... I haven't played EQ in roughly a month -- And I only logged in a handful of times in the months preceeding that. However (as happens everytime I take a vacation from the Arts) my first evening back will be spent fielding "Welcome back! EQ isn't the same without you!" tells.<br /><br />And here's the kicker: I'll get them from a myriad of individuals -- From that level 17 wizard that came to RZ after following a link to AD.Com and becoming inspired to the level 65 AD-Lite shaman that just wants to chat about how cool (pardon the pun) it was in EverFrost back when we were in our teens. How many peeps under level 50 even have the faintest notion of who you are unless they read various boards?<br /><br />Now it's all fine and good that you'd like to pretend that LV stormed onto RZ, took over HiV and went on to champion the PK cause until growing bored and moving on to bigger &amp; better things...<br /><br />... Well that kinda crud may cut it in some circles but if ya think that such a line of phooey is gonna bowl me over you'd best think again.<br /><br />Of course I'm aware you were raiding with TUS folks, silly -- We were going to grant ya membership once we were sure you weren't just goofing around for a few weeks as pseudo-PKs. Not because you were some Uber "PK Army" -- Simply because your blue past gave ya some experience/capabilities in PvE matters which we didn't have.<br /><br />So when the HiV folks went their seperate ways... The faction with more PvE aspirations decided to go with you. Not because of your long and enviable 2 week history of carnage... Just cause you had the classes, knowledge and experience to kill MOBs.<br /><br />Who am I to dictate what makes a "real" PK? I'm the guy that had killed every barbarian born on RZ for a 2 year period while simultaneously fighting the NMS (Naked Mage Syndrome), proving that not all PKs were 13 year old assholes and doing so in a fashion which entertained more people than it irritated -- All while the people I'm apparently arguing with in this thread were farting around in Transcendent Order, OOD and [gasp] Pre-PK Lucid Vision for 50+ levels.<br /><br />So if ya don't like it.. Don't read it.<br /><br />Artfully Yours,<br /><br />Nnuk<br />Master of the Arts<br /><a href="http://www.artfuldeath.com" target="_blank">Artful Death Gallery</a>

You talk about impact on the server, well, I have no idea who you are.  I have never heard of Lucid Vision, and I only remember HiV as a druid, monk and shadownight that I fought constantly in Oasis and Nektulos.

Nnuk, I've always considered you one of the more intelligent, well spoken indviduals of rallos zek.  However, you cannot seriously believe that what is important on rallos zek is to be rememebered after the game is gone?<br /><br />It is just that, a game, and I find for the most part that rallos zek is boring at the upper levels.  It could probably be changed with one strong pvp oriented guild, of course they would still have to compete with people bearing three or four times the hps they have, but interesting nontheless.

Don't have any care for being tactful. I've watched you make barbed insults about my guild numerous times and I have remained silent only because I thought perhaps you weren't intentionally being rude. But if you're gonna talk the trash, at least be resigned to defending yourself when someone brings it back to you. It's not that I don't want to be a diplomatic person -- its simply that I feel I have been long enough. I responded mainly to your barbed jab (as usual) to my guild. I don't really care whether the the mass thinks PKing is dead or not. I've been diplomatic with you for a long time, and I grow tired of your small-minded insults, and despite your belief, I am not "furiously whacking my keyboard" while I'm typing here. Trust me, after I posted I felt bad about being so rude, but that doesn't mean what I said I don't agree with 100%.<br /><br />You're right. Impact would depend on how I define it. If you look at guild KOS lists -- lets take MiM for example. You'll see "Lucid Vision KOS" -- not FoH, or AD or any other PK guild, but LV. Now, why do you think that is? It's because we were the only PK guild in their range. I'd rather affect the top 10 guilds (as far as PvE and levels/gear goes) then 100 low level guilds. Maybe we can agree to disagree here, but I still contend that PKing in the higher levels is not only harder, but it yeilds more kill satisfaction and high-end gear than newbie_slaying010. So whether or not you dispute us being "bluebies that want gear" -- the fact is, as a contingent, we were the most heavy hitting PK guild, although, for their time, I still think DB still holds seat one. I think Drakkyn called that arrogance; me? I just call it a fact.<br /><br />And I wouldn't call our PK range narrow. Anyone that intended to level to their characters full potential was in my range. Just like most LV. You for example. I think you were 54 or 55. You had 8 levels to PvP the player base. I also had 8 levels to PvP the player base. Only difference between you and I is its harder for me to score kills. IE: More challenging. Just like the rest of us. But we still did it, and fairly well.<br /><br />Is there anyone that hasn't uttered the phrase "GAH u fukkin foh assholes suck!!!"? Well, yea. I never did. Mangar never did. Shoon never did, or Darkahn, or Lairans, or Laroux, or Arakan, or Psycholistic or.. yea, the list goes on. But seriously, unless you're a level 20 chilling in the newbie sandbox, you didn't deal with FoH. Not because you scampered to get out of their level range! But because if you wanted to evolve with your character, you simply leveled. FoH -- and I'm not trying to be offensive here -- didn't mean anything to me, or anyone else higher than level.. what? 20 or 30? You tell me. I ran into them a few times on my wizard twink and corpse camped one of their wizards for like 30 minutes before, though. Who would talk about us? Um.. only the entire high end player base. You have to remember, not only do I not know crap about the lowbies that populated the server, I have no idea who "Legions of Legends" are, either. This is the major difference between you and someone thats higher level. It's not arrogant that I don't know who you're refering to, its simply that these people had absolutely no effect on my EQ life, consequently -- I don't know who they are.<br /><br />Frankly, I don't care how many "Welcome back!" tells you get. I obviously didn't play the same way you did. I was always more interested in duels and actual killshots of people I didn't like then people being giddy at my very presence, but its not actually so different. Even though I'm a PK, I always represented myself as someone with integrity, which I'm sure other people can attest for. You have a similiar reputation, but honestly, do you think people were more wary about fighting Shoon, or you? I'm just making loose examples here.<br /><br />Thats great that you have a nostalgic 65 shaman in AD that shoots the hay with you about how fun it was when he was a newbie fighting you. Me on the other hand, I've dueled those people. I've killed many of them. I'm not sure what point you're trying to make. Wait-- I think I get it. You're trying to say that because some AD guys actually remembers his scoffles with you an eon ago, that somehow makes you more of an impact than lets say.. me, who has numerous kill shots of those people? (chuckle) Okay, how many peeps under level 50 even have the faintest notion of who I am -- gee, I don't know but I'm inclined to say, "Gee, I don't care." If I wanted the lower level base to give a [censored] about me I'd have played my character as a lowbie, but I was more interested in killing the toughest people on the server. What kind of a silly point are you trying to make with that argument? I mean, c'mon!<br /><br />You're wrong again about TUS. Mangar turned down their offer and told them when they come on LV raids -- they adhere to LV rules. And we *DID* absorb all of HiV that still actively played. Thats a fact. We were content to do our own thing -- didn't make a difference to us one way or the other. And when you say "We were going to grant you access" do you mean to tell me that you were apart of a raid guild that was designed to get bluebie_loot? Our dealings with TUS were very minimal at best at any rate. I remember going to 2 TUS things to get a feel for those people and heal them because their highest cleric was 49. Mangar also helped them. We had nothing to benefit from helping those people besides gaining political allies and potential new LV material. Most of those people were green.<br /><br />Like I said, we had been PKing for months before we even bumped into TUS. I don't see any other reason disputing these facts with you as I only saw you in game several times anyway and I'm sure your memory is somewhat hazy.<br /><br />It always comes back to Everfrost with you, doesn't it? Look, I can't express how much I simply do not care about your nostalgic days of kicking around in the snow at Everfrost. I'm inclined to say, "Who really gives a crap?" So you were a wizard that could (/gasp) kill newbies. That is absolutely shocking and frankly, I think the local media should be contacted immediately and get in touch w/ CNN to give you the appropriate attention that you so rightly deserve. News flash -- I was a PK on Vasten till level 44. I was in Darkenbane at level 20 and I aquired many shots in that time. I died once as I leveled and started at 1. 44 to 49 LV was at war with Begotten and I periodically played Nenlain and killed tB. Few months later LV decided to go PK.<br /><br />"So if ya don't like it.. Don't read it."<br /><br />It's not that I don't like what you're saying, its simply that what you're saying isn't accurate and I feel the need to clarify for you because -- like it or not -- you don't have a clue what you're talking about.<br />

Dispite how many times ive been flamed for thinking pvp is dead on rallos, im sorry. It obvously is not dead. Hell if the curse is running around, it must not be dead ( Sarcasm Off ) <br /><br />Shut the [censored] up nnuk and go become a writer. <br /><br />Look at PoP. Look at all the expansions that Verant has released. Verant couldnt give a rats ass about any of the pvp servers. Anti's running around with 9k hp and 60/20 weapons. Its redicilous. <br /><br />Unless your a manaburning wizard you have no chance of making it on rallos high end pvp. Theres NO organization for team pk. Hell. I think PvP should be organized, that it should relate towards 2 sides, just like any battle. It should have core organized members , not a bunch of HiV, Curse, Lv Panzys single shotting people out everywhere. Pk's should be raiding and acquiring gear to overcome the anti's, not saying how gay PvE is all the time. Do you know why AD , MiM, Wudan, And hell even Ordo Malleus were big ? Is because they had ORGANIZATION, and they werent ran by little 12 year olds, who are just learning how theyr'e ego can take them to to hells winter. Stop acting like some big shots from the block, work together and get [censored] done instead of always fighting. And thats what happend with team pk, everyone hated eachother, no organization, no teamwork just people fighting in my opinion like kids at school. <br /><br />Thats what i think rallos is in a nut shell.

i can tell you, from playing both my 24 sk Waert and 24 druid wihbam, and then my 60 rogue kolek/bodu, that the 56+ pk scene is much more noteworthy.  i could have killed hundreds upon hundreds of people on waert (especially before resist nerf), but it didn't mean [censored] to me.  i owned paludal caverns for a small time there, but i only used it to raise funds for my higher level character so he could one day become pve-sufficient to hold his own against others, and join lv.. the things you have to realize are that 1. there is a large percentage all stuffed at the end of the scale of leveling, each level doesn't have 1/60th of the population in it. so even though you kill levels 20-28 doesn't mean thats the same amount of people 52-60. so the higher end levels do in fact probably affect more people. 2. people lower than probably about 40 haven't developed pvp skills, dont know their class real well, and would rather run from a pk than try to get some revenge.. it just hasn't been built up in them yet.  so you can slaughter them endlessly with your veteran-like skill, while they spin in circles asking where that bright flash of nuke came from.  upper end pvp you fight people that know what they're doing (usually).  sure twinks may have an impact, but twinks are such a small percentage (hehe especially after the hooping-revolution that came through and resists) that they don't really count. i mean honestly, if you have levitate and nukes in everfrost, how hard is it? every time i would go though everfrost i would think.. man this is just perfect ground for a wizard to levitate and have a hay-day... sure nnuk you played your class well, but with advantages of poor barb newbies, with a veteran floating over their heads (i can only guess you used levitate. even if not you are still the veteran picking on newbies that aren't real sure what their spells do yet)... so LV &gt; lowbie pking ;x

Now i am not sure but isnt kolek/bodu a haxxored account. (again not sure just rings a bell from some posts on LV) hacked accounts are for fags.<br /><br />but on another note, i agree 60+ pking makes more of a impact on people if done right. And i think u meant you were good before every1 started using the Ivandyr hoop as i have never seen u pk w/o it. Now that is profound skillage sir, Pking with a broken (in PVP) item makes u teh WINNAR!11<br /><br />Btw 60+ pking is the best but its about 100 times harder then any other levels. as a PK i am up against ppl with 100 times my hp/mana/aas/resists/ect. and me with no manaburn.  <img src="/ubbthreads/images/graemlins/frown.gif" alt="" /> . plus the fact that the only high level pks i know are<br /><br />Aiare: 59 MB wiz<br />aevanne: 60 MB wiz<br />Flawlex: 61 Monk<br />milase: 60 druid<br />Psycholostic: 61 MB wiz<br />kirby: 61 wiz<br />lail: 59 druid<br />nimbas: 63 shaman<br />stanexx: 64 wizard (65? now maybe)<br />vadiar: 60 wiz<br />hateraid: 59 SK<br />Forgot name but: 60 monk<br /><br />Hmm i think i see a problem with classes...<br />that only makes about 12 (or maybe a bit more if i 4got some) high level pks that are on regularly with only about 5 being even to ALL of AD/MIM/Wudan plus the fact that the class selection is slim so PVE is nearly out of the question. I think if more people went PK it might start a chain reaction, and a High level (BIG) pk guild is all that rallos needs in order to be fun again (guild wars own) at least IMO. That would really make an impact...

First-- I was expecting a proper rebuttal, but as it turns out, this is quickly becoming a very weak argument on your end. That said, let me clarify anything that you need help with. Here we go..<br /><br />The very *FIRST* day Lucid Vision went PK we surprised the server. We were running to Chardok to go experience and Lifetakker said Insanity's Edge was there and he wouldn't level in the same zone as them because he despised IE. So we said to ourselves, "Well, we wanted to exp in Chardok. Ah, screw it. Lets just kill them." We had the majority of the guild on and we quickly decided our course. Ran into Chardok and PKed Himimi and some other fool. They were both 60. If you look back at the very first post I made over a year ago, it featured us killing IE, MiM and AD. Don't you remember? We made a mockery of the people we killed, who, coincidentally-- happened to be level 60. If your argument is centered around me being a maximum level of 55.. I got news for you.... I wasn't. We didn't have any help from any other PK guilds because we killed *EVERYONE*.<br /><br />Ahh.. wait. Your saying that I'm lying because we obviously weren't a PK guild for at least several months before we absorbed most of HiV. Don't know what to tell you. None of the PK guilds were even in our range. We didn't have anyone in LV that was 55 or under at the time. It was a 56+ guild and most of our characters were 58 or so at the time, except our twinks. You think HiV got absorbed simply because we had some PvE experience? Wakie wakie. We had the levels and the conviction to be a good guild for them under a bold leader.<br /><br /></font><blockquote><font class="small">Quote:</font><hr /><br />Still with me here? Good.<br /><br /><hr /></blockquote><font class="post"> <br /><br />You don't honestly think you've gained leverage in this "verbal joust" do you? I've been outpacing you from the start, guy. lol?<br /><br /></font><blockquote><font class="small">Quote:</font><hr /><br />Now we both know it wouldn't be hard to dig up posts from various boards in which folks like Mearis refered to you and yours as "Club 55" for most of the last year -- So it follows that you'll conceed that you couldn't have possibly been level 60 at that time. You were, at most, level 55.<br /><br /><hr /></blockquote><font class="post"><br /><br />Mearis' posts stemmed around mainly Drakkel and Nedrian because they refused to level past 55. Most LV were actually level 56+. Let me refer you to our roster which is located here.. <a href="http://www.lucid-vision.org/roster.php." target="_blank">http://www.lucid-vision.org/roster.php.</a> you'll notice that only a few members and twinks are 55. When we started out, like I said-- mainly everyone was 56 and beyond. Also, we generally didn't force existing members to level because thats not how our guild operated. When we proclaimed 56 as our minimum guild level limit, it was because a lot of the people that we absorbed we all lower level than most of us. Heck, when we got most of the HiV guys-- a lot of them were green to the current LV member base. I think the only one that wasn't was Timon and maybe Guznuk.<br /><br /></font><blockquote><font class="small">Quote:</font><hr /><br />Nnuk lvl 51 + 70% HiV of higher level - You at a max of lvl 55 = Um... You're color blind? Proper use of the /consider command is beyond your apparently limited abilities?<br /><br /><hr /></blockquote><font class="post"><br /><br />Allow me to blow your limited argument out of the water in one fell swoop. When we went PK -- I played my necromancer Nenlain. He was level 58. Only for the last 7 months or so did I care to level my druid from 49 to 60. Again.. if you didn't catch that.. I was playing my necromancer who was 58. When I went with TUS on a raid --which happened once or twice-- I remember this level 60 necromancer zoning in and Mangar and I being the only people in range to the guy. Needless to say he died, but out of like 20 TUS people, only Mangar and I were in range to level 60. So to help you understand, yes, you and pretty much all of the people that you raided with were as green as grass to us. You follow?<br /><br /></font><blockquote><font class="small">Quote:</font><hr /><br />Ya know...

If the being level 55 was your thing, all the power to you. I always wanted to hang with the heavy hitters. It's not so much that anyone not in the highest level game is nothing, its just that you aren't in the grand scheme of things. Hey, like I said, if you like squandering with newbies -- more power to you. I'm sure you scared the dickens out of a few of them, but me personally? I only know you because of your message board posts. I've seen you in game maybe 3-5 times and you. Not you, nor any other PK guild ever had any impact on my life. The only one I fought on a daily basis was DB a long time ago. Your whole goal was to become notorious and well-known, right? Well, I'd personally rather be well-known for my skill then my pretty little mouth on a message board. See, if you ask someone that knows the both of us, they'll probably say, "Vasten wasn't as liberal as Nnuk and Nnuk sure had a way with words!" But they'll also say something like, "Yeah, but he would have owned Nnuk any day of the week." And I seriously am not stroking my own ego here because thats simply a fact. Same goes with the rest of LV. When an entire guild can take a dump on your head and you can't do anything about it but try and poke fun at them on message boards and take small potshots at them -- you're a small thing in the  <i>grand scheme of things.</i> <br /><br />I'm going to have to refer you back to my 2nd post in this thread where I said something like, "like it or not.. you don't have a clue what you're talking about." You just built up a really makeshift argument about absolute "poppycock" and tried to spin that off as some minor uhm.. victory? Talk about catastrophe. There is a reason why you're the only person that really disputes these facts, and just because Nnuk says its false, doesn't mean the truth isn't glaring right infront of your face.<br /><br />You know, I don't think you're such a bad guy and I usually enjoy reading your posts, too, but you should really shut your trap and recognize. You don't have crap on LV, as evidenced by that lame argument. Refer above to last Nnuk post for prime example. One before that was pretty damn weak, too. So you don't like LV-- shouldn't have expected people in it, even me, who was a potential ally to let you badmouth my guild. You'd have to be..  <i>clinically retarded!</i> <br /><br />Enjoy dem apples.  <img src="/ubbthreads/images/graemlins/grin.gif" alt="" />

I choose to read this comedy and not comment because truthfully as much as I disagree...that's my past.  <br /><br />The only thing I'll say Vast is you keep using the words "when we absorbed HiV"  just to let you know.... the people whom you raided with, and eventually guilded were just the leftovers who didn't deguild from HiV when hiv stepped out of the pk game.<br /><br />You didn't absorb hiv.  I guess it's a matter of opinion, same as all of this thread.  Oh, and at the end of your post you made an excellent point.<br /></font><blockquote><font class="small">Quote:</font><hr /><br /><br />So you don't like LV-- shouldn't have expected people in it, even me, who was a potential ally to let you badmouth my guild. You'd have to be.. clinically retarded! <br /><br /><br /><hr /></blockquote><font class="post"><br /><br />I dunno about you, but I see the words you throw out so nonchalantly trying to say that HIV should wish they were LV, and all the other subliminal things you said....you have friends that were a part of that guild. You tell them "I'm not trying to disresepect you, I'm just speaking my mind"  the point of respecting a friend is knowing when speaking your mind may be disrespectful to him.  That's like me saying to my best friend "Man, I don't want to sound disrespectful, but when I saw your sister in her coffin, I remembered how useless she was in this world"  If you truly value their friendship it's things you just don't say.<br /><br />I could drone on about how wrong I think you are, but it all boils down to opinions. You think LV was something, I think HIV was something. At the end of the convo we're both people who played a game the way we wanted to.  My way wasn't your way, your way wasn't mine.  Doesn't make it wrong that either of us played it our way. It just makes it different.  Despite LVs sidemouthed comments, I've been nothing but respectful to their members (especially my friends in your guild) and I've basically put myself on your boards as a answerman for your and others shadowbane questions.<br /><br />Then on other forums you state "your opinion" about how my guild wasn't worth [censored] compared to yours.  I dunno about everyone else, but do you see the difference between myself, and the way you and your guild act?  Maybe I'm crazy. I could be. I've been told I am before.<br /><br />this post was about 5 times longer than I wanted it to be, but, it was just something I had to say. I'm not here to participate in arguments over a game I no longer play, no longer care about, but... when disrespect continues to happen, no matter what lengths I go to, to be a friend/respect those people, that is something that goes beyond a game.<br /><br />

You consider members of your guild "Leftovers"? Hey, I won't argue with that if you wanna consider it like that. Thats your choice, but when we absorbed HiV, Guznuk was the current leader and you had disappeared for the most part. There were around 15 members in HiV (I guess) at the time. Maybe more, maybe a few less. Point is, they were still active when we absorbed them. Go ahead and dispute the facts all you want-- doesn't mean they don't still clearly exist.<br /><br />I sent Arri a one sentence message yesterday that was similiar to that. If he told you that, hey, great. I don't care. You want me to lie and nance around how I actually felt abuot your guild? I could have been more blunt about it. If he doesn't think I like'em based on my feelings for a guild that he was in (the I could care less about that guild because they didn't mean [censored] to me feelings) -- what can I do? It's great that you make yourself available for advice on LV's forum for SB. Please keep in mind though that I haven't asked you for anything and I don't even have firm intentions of playing SB immediately. I haven't even downloaded the beta. My knowledge about SB is limited because I won't have the time soon to invest in that game.<br /><br />And while you may have contentions with my comments, that don't mean I don't agree with what I'm saying, and because you make yourself an "answerman" on LV's boards, doesn't mean I owe you anything. You're not going to find a post with me picking your brain about SB. You do that stuff on your own accord, while I appreciate your intentions, they will have no sway over my own words.<br /><br />You're worth as much as you think you are. If my words effect your opinion of yourself, sorry. Hey, I happen to think HiV was a pretty good PK guild by all accounts for the level range they existed in while they were a guild. But for me when you played? HiV had ZERO to do with my EQ experience. I was higher level, and on the rare occasion that I bumped into someone in HiV I always sent them fleeing. That was maybe twice, ever. I've seen the stories about group kills and all that from other people that have encountered HiV. However, while I played-- not even for 2 minutes did they ever have any adverse effect on any of my characters.<br /><br />And don't totally misunderstand my point about "HiV should have aspired to be LV." What I was trying to explain (and I know it came off sounding harsh) was that most HiV were green to LV, so why would we want to pretend we're them when we're the ones that are all higher level? Would you admire green con PKs? No. So if anyone was admiring anyone, wouldn't it be HiV trying to be LV, instead? I'm formulating this example so you can understand my position. I'm really not trying to slam the hell out of HiV-- I'm simply saying they were not an important factor of our guild. Not until a lot of their members followed Guznuk and Timon, which was a pleasure because most of those people ruled.<br /><br />Difference between Nnuks "LV was a wannabe HiV" and my comments is that mine are accurate and his are not. Thats the only point I'm trying to make. By all measures, HiV was a good PK guild for its duration. I do not dispute that because I recognize that as true. But don't think for even a split second that we aspired to be anyone BUT LV, because that would be a ridiculously ignorant misinterpretation of the truth. I'm actually really sorry for how blunt I come off, but I consider my friends my family and family comes first, and insulting them will get a heavy rebuttal from me.

I don’t think LV was wannabe HIV’s.  LV was nothing like HIV.  The only thing we had in common was we both had aspirations to be higher level pk guilds.  HIV didn’t quite make it.  Lv did.  I have no problem admitting the truths.  I just don’t think that means LV was a better guild.  We’re dealing with different base ingredients.  I’ve come to realize things in the years I’ve played EQ. I used to have the mindset that if you weren’t going for the top rung of existence, then you were a loser.  If your guild didn’t aspire to reach the top, then you were content with the bottom, and that made you weak.<br /><br />I was such a conceited [censored] for thinking that.  There are guilds that existed before and after mine that didn’t have aspirations to be a major power in EQ.  Flowers of Happiness and Artful Death mainly.  They didn’t give 2 fucks about what others thought their station in life was.  They laid down a guild plan, and they followed it. They achieved everything they wanted out of the game.  Blart was a [censored] genius.  Of all the guilds that ever existed on Rallos Zek, there is not another guild on that server that will be as well known by people from other servers as Blart/Fansy from Flowers of Happiness.  That’s just a fact.  Darkenbane comes in second place.  They were the first official pk guild to take the spotlight. They paved the way for what both of our guilds eventually grew into. Rising up out of the lower levels and competing with the people who said we never could.  And we did. On a constant basis.  They were our forefathers so to speak.  Artful Death.  Nnuk had the most original pk guild concept aside from blart. Killing people, and viewing it as works of art. Not aspiring to take over the world, just playing the game to have fun the way he wanted to, and not letting anyone tell him otherwise.  <br /><br />Like it or not, one of the guilds you maliciously bash (Flowers) will have more notoriety than you could ever imagine having with Lucid Vision.  People from Rallos might remember Lucid Vision, I’m not disputing that. People from Rallos will remember Flowers too.  People from Sullon will remember Flowers,  I bet for the rest of existence, if you pooled people from all the servers into a room, if you listed all the guilds that existed on Rallos Zek, the one that will get the most people saying “Oh yeah I know them” will be Flowers of Happiness.  The guild you essentially said didn’t do [censored] in or for EQ.  Do you get what I’m saying Vasten?  Sure those guilds may not have had much respect in your mind, but that’s because what you get out of EQ is completely different from what they do.  So when you look at them you see a lesser guild, when in reality, that’s just your “Lucid Vision” of them.  Pun intended hehe.  <br /><br /><br />

i pked without ivandyr hoops all the time.. now if someone was a twink they probably didn't see more than 40% of their health gone with real pvp before hoops, but i went around paludal slaughtering newbies/looking for twinks a lot.. i really didn't find slaughtering newbies with a shard of night, fungi, and 100 to all resists that much fun.. and my acc didn't get hacked. i got banned for having hacked goods.  <br />oh ya, i did use to play when other people used hoops. hoops have been used for a long time, its not until last few months they got popular, but i had people try to hoop me all of the time. there IS defense for it...and to think about it, in order for you to attack someone that knows there are hoops, and maybe even know you have hoops, without them running away, or letting you hoop them, does take a little bit of skill. (not a whole lot, but there is some there, i deserve a little ounce of credit perhaps than being teh winnar)

Arri: "Unfortunately some of those stupid people ended up getting in the guild (Guznuk, Timon, etc...)."<br /><br />A couple posibillities here. I could be misunderstanding what you meant by this. If not, see below. <br /><br />As far as I can recall, and see on Stephans, I was in HiV more than 6 months before you were ever guilded. Some of the "stupid" people such as Timon and myself were crucial in the development of the sect that you conveniently decided to hop fences to. Grudges aside, can you tell me any different?

When threads like this begin discussing the large PK Sects of Rallos, HiV is almost always mentioned - rightfully so. That mention does not just come because we killed a few people though. HiV's only memory will not be Apple, River, Relicc (and Konevik, why does he always get left out?) as you mentioned. HiV picked up where Darkenbane left off and was a steadfast role-model for the PK-PvE-hopeful. That came with hours of frustration and effort from many people. It's not easy to gather together some of the most chaotic people on a server and have them work together with at least some discipline. Granted, we weren't in the high-end PvE game but nonetheless, we faced challenges like all guilds do. People were behind the scenes working with those challenges. Not just myself, not just Rahne, not just anyone - a whole bunch of us. You, however, were not one of them. Grudge or no grudge, brushing some of those people off as 'the stupid people' is worthy of argument. <br /><br />As for the downfall of HiV in Everquest, that's a story that only a few know the truth of and will never be fully explained to people like you. <img src="/ubbthreads/images/graemlins/wink.gif" alt="" /><br /><br />

Uh.  I'll let you continue your guys' argument, I want nothing to do with it, but why wouldn't arri know the "truth" he's one of the best in game friends I have.<br /><br />The rest is nothing I care to get into about. I've moved on.<br /><br />Oh, here's another not so hot topic I can comment on.  Let's face the facts, 90% of the people who remember HIV remember getting owned by River, Relicc, and Apple.  and yes Konevik, but he wasn't there nearly as much so he's left out alot.<br /><br />The majority of those times I was with them when it happened, but the times people MOST remember, is their days around the time River and them first joined HIV, and before those days, when they were the terror of the Oasis area.  <br /><br />So... yes.  THe mojority of people who remember HIV (the old school people anyways) Remember the fuckers three, and reference us to them.  I'm okay with that.  They deserve the notoriety, they were the best.<br /><br />

Don't get me wrong here, I'm not trying to muffle their thunder - those guys owned. My point was that they were not the only accomplishment of HiV, something I think we both agree on. As for Arri not knowing the truth of the HiV's downfall -- as he so casually blamed on me -- that wasn't a personal insult. That truth is something for you and me. <img src="/ubbthreads/images/graemlins/wink.gif" alt="" /><br /><br /><br /><br />

Your exactly right.  BUT... one thing you have to keep in mind. Not all of those guilds were a power at the same time.  HIV glory days were mainly before LV even decided to go pk. Same with DB, AD and so on.  Just horrible timing for any of us to unite together, and add to that your statements (the egos, the pride we had in our guilds) it just was a damning factor.  I think one thing I've noticed is, because we face such harsh critism all the time from everyone (being pursued, envied, hated by all the other non-pk guilds) Pk guilds just naturally have so much pride in their guild for doing what it did.  When people try to take that away, hell ensues.  It's a natural reaction.  Whether or not anyone ELSE thinks what we did was an accomplishment, these were and are my "family" and if people try to make them appear less important than I think they are, I step up to defend that "memory" so to speak.<br /><br />I'm sure I'm am FAR from not alone with this attitude.<br /><br /></font><blockquote><font class="small">Quote:</font><hr /><br />OMG this thread is making me vomit,and I am hungover to.<br /><br />[censored] like this just shows why us pkers didn't make it to TOV,and succeed at high ass places.<br /><br />I am not trying to be a prick here ,but the pking community is nothing but ego maniacs that think one or one's guild is better than the other.<br /><br />Why not just unite,and stfu..<br /><br />No wonder why the pking community didn't last too long on RZ.<br /><br />Everyones always talking smack to eachother...and thinking their better..<br /><br />LV,HIV,AD,ROP,and others guildless as myself but stayed on the dark side, could of got alot of [censored] going if we would of just shutted the [censored] up,and worked together.<br />Put our differences aside,and get the [censored] along.<br /><br /><br />It was egos and greed that lead to why pking guilds don't excist much on RZ to this day.<br /><br />This is why the bluebies won...<br /><br />Just my two cents <br /><br /><br /><br />    <br /><br /><hr /></blockquote><font class="post">

A few points to be made:<br />Some people take this game far too seriously. (If your jaw dropped because I referred to EverQuest as a "game" then I was referring to you.)<br />I've done 3 types of playing - PK, anti, and neutral. I like em all, they are all fun in their own ways. [censored] right off if you think any less of me for having fun. I was a member of House In'Visus and remember Nedrian (/kick), a member of Lucid Vision then AND now, hunting me down a few times to stomp the crap outta me when they were anti. Some of the best fun in HIV was leveling in ToFS with Timon and Corbon. I also remember Arri buffing a twink ogre, him killing me, hearing me whine because I was new to the game and had no idea where my corpse was, so he took me to it and would smack the [censored] outta me if I refused to follow him.. remember those level 1 corpse runs? And Jookes standing at the newbie bind wasting elves as soon as they loaded at their bind spot? THAT's what Rallos Zek is all about, and they've nerfed most of it.<br />It's a game. And that character you spend your free time advancing in whatever way you deem fit, be it killing mobs, killing players, or just killing time... that character in many cases does not even reflect the personality of the person playing it. I could run around nuking kids all day long on my druid, but that doesn't mean I'm at all likely to ride around in the trunk of a car with a hole big enough for the barrel of my rifle to fit through shooting random people... <br />Play however YOU have fun, and don't bitch about others who have different ways of playing. When I return to Rallos from Legends, God knows I'm gonna have fun checking off my very long [censored] list.

I'm not interested in sounding like a faerie. You provide nothing at all relevant at any rate. I've come to the conclusion that with your fairly weak response (which is admittedly redundant at this point) you're just arguing for the sake of it now. I can appreciate that-- no one wants to be #2 but when you're wrong, you're wrong.

But is this the mother [censored] truth or isn't it ??? <br /><br />Now you can poke fun at Nnuk's Everfrost adventures all you want but hey the guy stayed true to his roots from day ass one.<br /><br />Lucid Vision wasn't meant for being a pk guild just the same as Everquest wasn't meant to be a PVP server.<br /><br />But did they end up falling into that ??? Lucid Vision went random later,but no they were not created from the pking mind from the start.<br /><br />Lets get realistic here,and come into reality that AD were always pkers from day ass one,and LV went from neutrals/anti raid guild to random after they got sick of raiding,and seeing the anti bullshit on RZ.<br /><br />So my conclusion is AD was always random,and LV wasn't.... <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

<img src="/ubbthreads/images/graemlins/shocked.gif" alt="" /> No, it really happened a few months ago. And, no, I didn't do it. A guy and his former step-son went around the country, Washington state, Virginia, Washington, D.C. areas.. one of em driving and the other in the trunk, with a hole cut out just big enough for them to see out of and shoot. They just drove around shooting for no reason (none that has been disclosed to the public anyway, that I am aware of).. it was just as drastic a comparison as I could think of. <img src="/ubbthreads/images/graemlins/smile.gif" alt="" /><br /><a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0" target="_blank">http://www.foxnews.com/story/0</a>,2933,65103,00.html

... I'm the one that made the comment, knows what was meant by it and -- when faced with your purposeful obtuseness -- showed why it was correct in it's proper context.<br /><br />I'll grant that one would actually have to have read the thread(s) involved in order to know wtf they were talking about and since you've already stated that you didn't... Your initial ignorance is totally understandable. Your ongoing ignorance, however, sorta smacks of the "crime" you accuse me of. ;-)<br /><br /><br /></font><blockquote><font class="small">Quote:</font><hr /><br />Since I've lied blatantly in the thread, I'm sure you will provide reasonable proof in the regards considering you so freely claim I "am" a liar, and yet provide no proof or reason 'why'. You simply say I am<br /><br /><hr /></blockquote><font class="post"><br /><br />Correct.. I simply say you are.<br /><br />This may come as a shock to you, Vast... But when one maintains a presence in certain circles for several years without giving cause to be mistrusted -- Well odds are this individual is credible.<br /><br />That would be me.<br /><br />But if you insist.. Ok -- Let's pick one comment.<br /><br />You said that most of HiV was green to LV and, as such, were beneath your notice.<br /><br />According to some of your (ex) members... Mangar, Nenlain and Lifetakker were the only 56+ characters in LV at the time. In fact.. Y'all would regularly have to get one of your druids to log onto a 54 tank just to do things like Fear.<br /><br />Notice how just saying that you're lying takes up less space with the same end result? I'm sure most regular readers would agree that my posts are long enough without having to quantify every little thing I say.<br /><br /><br /></font><blockquote><font class="small">Quote:</font><hr /><br />Thats great but I'm a PK so you'll have to excuse me while I search for the point in your prattle.<br /><br /><hr /></blockquote><font class="post"><br /><br />My "point" is that while you talk up a good line of [censored]... At it's core your arguments have been nothing but the same old tired crap spewed by the granola crunching hordes since before the concept of EQ popped into McQuaid's head on one drunken evening.<br /><br />Now this is all fine and good. I mean.. So what if you throw like a gir.... Umm.. Talk (think?) like an Anti?<br /><br />Oh wait.. Does it become relevant when you're trying to use the same arguments against me that AD-Lite &amp; Co have been hurling at you for the past year? Not yet? Well how about when one takes into account that you've spent most of that year shooting down those "points" as the ramblings of incompetent fuckwits?<br /><br />What's good for the goose is good for the gander, Vasten. Anything else is hypocrisy -- Another stereotypical bluebie trait, I might add.<br /><br /><br /></font><blockquote><font class="small">Quote:</font><hr /><br />I've come to the conclusion that with your fairly weak response (which is admittedly redundant at this point) you're just arguing for the sake of it now.<br /><br /><hr /></blockquote><font class="post"><br /><br />You've come to that conclusion, have you?<br /><br />[chuckles]<br /><br />Work with me here, lad...<br /><br />YOU jumped down MY throat in regards to a comment you didn't understand in a discussion you've admittedly not read -- And now you're expecting me to bow down before you, oh pillar of PKing, because you got your panties in a wad?<br /><br />LOL<br /><br />I think not -- You'd have better odds cowing me in game than you would here, sparky. And I believe pretty much anyone with 2 brain cells to rub together can calculate precisely what those odds would be.<br /><br />On another note...<br /><br />Antis haven't "won" shite, Tare.<br /><br />Do they hang in zones folks like us rarely go? Well yeah. (I wonder why? ;-))<br /><br />Do they attend raids that PKs never will? Prolly.<br /><br />Here's the thing though... That's what they do. It's perfectly reasonable to expect them to have greater PvE success because that's what they devote their time and energy towards.<br /><br />We devote ours to killing peeps. They killed the AIW in TS and looted a JAOSS? Big whoop -- I killed over a thousand people before most of 'em knew wtf "Uber" meant.<br /><br />I mean seriously.. Take some of these "best" PvPers that certain folks like to talk about. Malio.. How many PvP kills do ya think he's got in EQ? 10? 50? 100? Hell... Let's be generous and give him 500 -- So AT BEST he's got around as many PvP kills as your least active character.<br /><br />Not exactly impressive in the grand scheme of things, eh?<br /><br />Success is measured by one's goals. Theirs is to kill MOBs... And they're good at it. Full props to 'em.<br /><br />Mine is to kill them... And very few with firsthand knowledge would argue that I've been less than successful at it.<br /><br />It's all a matter of perspective, really -- Did you accomplish what you set out to do? Yes?

You win too! <img src="/ubbthreads/images/graemlins/cool.gif" alt="" /><br /><br />Artfully Yours,<br /><br />Nnuk<br />Master of the Arts<br /><a href="http://www.artfuldeath.com" target="_blank">Artful Death Gallery</a>

I'll try to make it totally vertical on your end. You being at the bottom, of course. Allow me to clarify for the inane, since you didn't read my post too too well, apparently. I said, and I quote..<br /><br />"I have no idea what Tuskadon said. He's a flaming idiot and I generally skip his posts altogether, so I'm not all too sure of what you're refering to."<br /><br />I have kept track of the thread for those involved that have any relevance *too the thread.* Because I think dear old Tuskadon is a moron, I simply do not read his posts. When you make a reference to him, I can't be held to reply because <i>I don't read his posts</i>. Is that clear? Whatever you're referencing is of no relevance at any rate. Stick to the topic at hand, and try not to circle argue with me and tangent of course too too much. Granted your line of reasoning is as transparent and thin as well.. a really transparent and thin argument, but.... sheesh! <br /><br /><br /></font><blockquote><font class="small">Quote:</font><hr /><br />According to some of your (ex) members...

I'm sure most regular readers would agree that my posts are long enough without having to quantify every little thing I say.<br /><br /><hr /></blockquote><font class="post"><br /><br />Wrong again! LV only had around 8 active members when we went PK. This whole "LV was a raid guild!" jargon is just that-- jargon. Druzz, Darkahn, Nenlain, Mangar, Lifetakker, Nesrin, Daymon and Lairans. Lairans is the only one of those that might have been 54 at the time. So am I a "blantant liar" (lol?) or are you just a horrible nitpicker that has such a ridiculously weak argument that you're making up absolute "poppycock" to prove a uhm.. (I use this term VERY loosely) point?<br /><br />Yeah.. real credible. All that "credibility" is flying out the window, "Sparky."<br /><br />Level 54 tanks joining us on our raids would be months later when we opened the doors on recruiting. And now that I think about it, we didn't actually recruit any tanks for a good long while. We had several tanks assist us that aspired to be PK but had other endeavors to accomplish before they considered going PK. Not that it really matters, but you get the idea of why we might have lower level tanks helping us in Fear, though I'm not really sure why we'd have been there considering the fact that we didn't have anyone at the time that needed anything there. Are you referring to the time period that Voltaic and Latnem joined? Thats the only reason why we might have been in Fear. When we completed that last step of his epic.. would have been months after we went PK. You wouldn't remember that little detail, though!<br />	<br /></font><blockquote><font class="small">Quote:</font><hr /><br />My "point" is that while you talk up a good line of [censored]...

You go ahead and fill space for your post by comparing apples to oranges and creating really cheesy analogies. Maybe one of your fans will find it somewhat amusing. I'll just brush by the rest of these and goto those "points" of yours. k spark spark?<br /><br /></font><blockquote><font class="small">Quote:</font><hr /><br />Now this is all fine and good.

Well how about when one takes into account that you've spent most of that year shooting down those "points" as the ramblings of incompetent fuckwits?<br /><br /><hr /></blockquote><font class="post"><br /><br />I guess it would depend on what you're trying to say here. I don't think I've used an "anti logic" in talking to you. But to quickly tell you, I don't think you have any kind of firm ground to even discuss "What it means to be a PK" in regards to me or my guild. Lets just look at the facts here. While you like to imply I argue like an "AD Lite" member, you will take into consideration that the people you try to mock, I'm the one that fought them, and my guild. You on the otherhand are more like a cheerleader. You want to talk about Mearis, Kringe, Malio, Kurakai? Hi -- get a clue. I've fought all of those people vigorously. It's not much of an argument on your end because you never even participated in fights vs the people you love to hate. I did, though. So as much as you enjoy branding me with this "Vasten has the mind of an anti" stigma, you just remember that its me, and not you, who fought and killed those people.<br /><br />Sounds so silly hearing you talk down to me like that in regards to people you never even fought barring your glorified Everfrost days umpteen years ago.<br /><br /></font><blockquote><font class="small">Quote:</font><hr /><br />YOU jumped down MY throat in regards to a comment you didn't understand in a discussion you've admittedly not read -- And now you're expecting me to bow down before you, oh pillar of PKing, because you got your panties in a wad?<br /><br /><hr /></blockquote><font class="post"><br /><br />I think you know just as well as I do that you could have used something more appropriate and "diplomatic" in your reasoning when you labeled my guild a "wannabe". Also keep in mind this isn't the first time you've taken potshots at my guild. I jumped down your throat for good reason. I understood your comment just fine. If you didn't 'exactly' mean what you said then perhaps you should have thought of something more appropriate to say in the first place. I don't expect you to bow down before me because I really don't care if you do or don't, but if you want to, I won't stop you either. Infact, I'd even go so far as to encourage it. I'll tell you what would sound right to me.<br /><br />"Oh, Vasten. You're right. I'm sorry for creating tangent arguments and wasting your precious time here. I shouldn't have insulted your guild. Can you please forgive me?"<br /><br />I'm not one to hold a grudge..<br /><br />Actually, yes I am. But I think I could possibly forgive you, Mighty Message Board Commando.<br /><br /></font><blockquote><font class="small">Quote:</font><hr /><br />I think not -- You'd have better odds cowing me in game than you would here, sparky.<br /><br /><hr /></blockquote><font class="post"><br /><br />Circumstantial.. I care as much about killing you in game as I do for continuing this dwindling debate. Though this is somewhat amusing for me, I think I've proven my point countless times and anything else said would be overly redundant.    <br /><br />All things aside, the only thing I'd care to have would be an acknowledgement that branding my guild as a "wannabe of anyone" would be inaccurate. Sure, I know I'm a shithead when I get into a heated debate, but I'm a shithead for good reason. Carelessly branding my guild -- something I poured time into -- with some ignorant statement like that just really eats me up!<br /><br />I know its inaccurate, but what gets under my skin is the fact that you would have other people believe that on a public message board. I think thats just downright offensive, espeicially considering we never considered your guild a rival of ours, let them attend anything we were doing because we enjoyed the company of your guild members for the people they are (and were) and tried to accomodate whenever we weren't heavily swamped doing things. I know for damn sure I did.

Just a wild stab in the dark here! Oh, you must mean this thread was started in responce to some <i>other</i> thread that pertained to him. <i>Nowwww</i> I see what you're saying.

Notice that these are people that will talk directly to you in PM's and other places, but won't chime in all to quickly in this thread. There are <i>reasons</i> for that. So while you consider the words of people that will talk about me and my guild directly <i>behind</i> my back, notice that they're not quick to publicly, Spark-spark.<br /><br /></font><blockquote><font class="small">Quote:</font><hr /><br />So I maintain that you're a blatant liar -- Folks can make up their own minds regarding what they care to believe. ;-)<br /><br /><hr /></blockquote><font class="post"><br /><br />Based off of -- heres the kicker everyone. <i>Nothing!</i><br /><br />See why your line of reasoning is so transparent, Sparkspark?

People have been trying to impeach my credibility for the better part of a decade.

All message board criteria aside, I just never cared much about you in game just like the majority of people you try to 'sketch' don't either, and I don't care about you much on message boards neither. While I may consider your words colorful and entertaining at times on a message board, you're pretty much just your typical cockroach to me in-game.

I'm a PK remember? A PK that has "infinitly" more experienced than you are. Suffice it to say, you're wrong. Take some advice from someone bigger and badder than you, Sparkspark.<br /><br /></font><blockquote><font class="small">Quote:</font><hr /><br />Impressive -- A mighty fine argument, Sir! ;-)<br /><br /><hr /></blockquote><font class="post"><br /><br />As evidenced by all the "dude lol youre owning nnuk" tells I'm getting from various people even reading this small posting session. I appreciate your feedback, though. Shows your not such a bad sport yourself! When I made that "acknowledgement" remark, it was because I was giving you a door out. And I'll tell you why.<br /><br />I felt sorry for picking on you.<br /><br />It's not generally my nature to pick on smaller individuals.<br /><br /></font><blockquote><font class="small">Quote:</font><hr /><br />Your killing peeps with next to no PvP experience aside... My point stands. Thing is that I didn't bring it up in order to "crush" you -- I was sorta hoping you'd realize how hypocritical you sound.<br /><br /><hr /></blockquote><font class="post"><br /><br />Thats half of my point, exactly. Chime on and on about people you really know nothing about. Do you realize how fast these people you like to refer to as "newbies" would kill you? I'm killing people with no PvP experience? How can you possibly sit there in that chair of yours with an even MILDLY straight face and go on with that absolute horsecrap? Heck, my kills might not be up there with yours, I mean.. how can I compare my meager duels, AD/MiM/Wudan/etc killshots with those high profile Harbingers of Thule shots you have? World will never know! Not even someone suffering from down-syndrome would assume to compare.<br /><br />There is you, though, apparently.<br /><br /></font><blockquote><font class="small">Quote:</font><hr /><br />I spent a fair portion of my last 2 months on RZ talking your members out of deleveling and quitting -- It wouldn't have been too difficult to do the opposite, were that my desire.<br /><br /><hr /></blockquote><font class="post"><br /><br />It just boggles my mind why anyone of my members would talk to you in the regards considering (a) You're pretty much a ghost on EQ and (b) You're pretty much a newbie, too. No offense, mind you.. I call all the 54'ers newbs. ;-)<br /><br />You been stuck in dah newbie box all your life!<br /><br />Don't misunderstand me, though. 55 and under game is significally different than your 61 to 65 game.

It's also quite clear how wrong I've proved you on this occasion. I don't see a point in simply repeating myself for the umpteenth time as you would have me do, but reading comprehension isn't exactly a strong suit, is it? <img src="/ubbthreads/images/graemlins/smile.gif" alt="" /><br /><br /></font><blockquote><font class="small">Quote:</font><hr /><br />In closing... I can't help but notice that your opinion regarding my "weak and transparent" posting style...<br /><br /><hr /></blockquote><font class="post"><br /><br />All depends. Posting style and SS style don't make quality. Thats my job. Lemme give you an example here. I might like the way someone fixes up a screenshot. Ghecko, for example. I really enjoy the way he rags on people in his shots. They're comical, and he's makes them look nice. Me on the other hand, I add some text usually and I'm finished my shot. The difference between you and I though is, I'm a high roller and you're a low roller. I'll explain. While you're killing newbies in Everfrost, I'm sitting in Sebilis or some other high level area killing the real deal players. Same thing goes for posting. I enjoy watching you pick apart countless "newbies" that like to try and talk down to the PK community. I'm much too lazy to waste my time usually, so I let someone beneath me (thats you) takecare of my light work. When the time presents itself (when the minion gets loud) I (poppa) open the door and brutally beat little minions ass.<br /><br />In other words, you might entertain me posting, and you might entertain me with your screenshots, but that doesn't mean I don't appreciate the quality of my work much much more -- because I do.<br /><br />Understand, Sparkspark? <img src="/ubbthreads/images/graemlins/smile.gif" alt="" /><br />	<br /><br /></font><blockquote><font class="small">Quote:</font><hr /><br />... Seems to vary depending upon whom is on the receiving end of it.<br /><br /><hr /></blockquote><font class="post"><br /><br />You're simply not capable of denting my armor, sonny. I see through all that boshit, and so do most of the other people that are reading this thread. ;-)

Nothing wrong with Mearis but I stood right next to Genaside when he smashed him at Lower Guk.  Genaside never leveled past 52, Mearis went on to 65.  Does being 65 make him a better pvper?  (No, having better gear makes it so.)<br /><br />I think the summary of Nnuk's argument is:<br /><br />Guilds like AD-lite called Lucid Vision lowbies, and said they were crappy players in general because of their chosen play style.  <br /><br />Rather than to set an example, Lucid Vision simply did the same towards guilds like Artful Death, HIV, ROP...well whatever.<br /><br />-Hamadryad<br />

That's the first time anyone's ever tried that line on me. Grats, lad! I'm giving you an A+ for originality -- Even though that's about as credible as the Taco Bell chihuahua snarling at a pitt bull as his skull's about to be crushed. ;-)<br /><br />It's getting late so I'll have to skip some of the more mundane crap spewed -- Don't worry though, folks... He'll likely repeat most of it another time and I'll respond to it then.<br /><br /></font><blockquote><font class="small">Quote:</font><hr /><br />It just boggles my mind why anyone of my members would talk to you in the regards considering (a) You're pretty much a ghost on EQ and (b) You're pretty much a newbie, too. No offense, mind you.. I call all the 54'ers newbs.<br /><br /><hr /></blockquote><font class="post"><br /><br />First and foremost.. You couldn't offend me if you tried. I've been called every name in the book by hundreds (thousands?) of people over the years -- One more isn't gonna make any difference.<br /><br />As to your boggled mind -- That's the point: You just don't understand.<br /><br />People that chose the PK lifestyle from the getgo (as opposed to the pissants that left AD-Lite and such out of boredom) find sitting around waiting for a MOB to pop incredibly tedious. Sure you can get them to "lvl up" by promising them fame and filling their heads with the same kind of balderdash (almost as good as poppycock, eh?) you've been spewing here.<br /><br />But, at the end of the day (or the Legends subscription, as the case may be), what's left is one bored motherfucker who is sick to death of being trained when he PvPs and told to "focus on leveling" when he isn't.<br /><br />So yeah.. More than a few of 'em came to see the ghost/n00b/whatever to get my opinion on what they should do to start having fun again.<br /><br />Why? Cause I've been around forever and I've already forgotten more about MMORPGs than you'll ever learn.<br /><br /><br /></font><blockquote><font class="small">Quote:</font><hr /><br />By this point in time a repeat of your original post doesn't bother me any. It's also quite clear how wrong I've proved you on this occasion.<br /><br /><hr /></blockquote><font class="post"><br /><br />Perhaps if you keep saying it.. You'll eventually be right!<br /><br />I do hope, for your sake, that being like HiV truly wasn't your goal. Aside from gaining a few of their members when they split up (due to your Uber absorbtion abilities!) -- You've fallen far short of the mark.<br /><br />And, finally...<br /><br /></font><blockquote><font class="small">Quote:</font><hr /><br />I enjoy watching you pick apart countless "newbies" that like to try and talk down to the PK community. I'm much too lazy to waste my time usually, so I let someone beneath me (thats you) takecare of my light work.

I'm not curious enough to look it up... Yet.) to smithereens for verbally raping you and your guildies  (again) with the very same arguments you're trying to use on me in this thread, tough guy.<br /><br />Now you can try to act all big and bad if that floats your boat, Vasten. But come on, man... Even I don't think people are stupid enough to be fooled in this instance and I have a very low opinion of humanity's collective intellect.<br /><br />Privately stated...<br /><img src="http://www.artfuldeath.com/galleries_current/nnuk/misc/posts/pics/totally_outclassed.jpg"><br /><br />...

Quite the 180, eh? A suspicious individual might get the impression that you're grasping at straws in an effort at saving face.<br /><br />Hell... Even your own mother would agree that you're full of shit on this one.<br /><br />[insert mom joke here]<br /><br /><img src="/ubbthreads/images/graemlins/4devil.gif" alt="" /><br /><br />Artfully Yours,<br /><br />Nnuk<br />Master of the Arts<br /><a href="http://www.artfuldeath.com" target="_blank">Artful Death Gallery</a><br /><br />ps I'm getting bored here, Vast.

… Dumbass!  <img src="/ubbthreads/images/graemlins/grin.gif" alt="" /><br /><br /><br /></font><blockquote><font class="small">Quote:</font><hr /><br />Well gee... Who the fuck cares?<br /><br />You said I should stick to the topic at hand as if I was wildly changing subjects -- You're the one that did it, silly.<br /><br />And yes, folks.. I fully understand that this is nitpicking but so fucking what? I'm still right.<br /><br /><hr /></blockquote><font class="post"><br /><br />Topic that we’re currently discussing. Your “LV was a wannabe PK guild!” comment.<br /><br />Come, come now, this isn’t rocket science. I’m sure someone of your self-professed knowledge can understand what exactly I mean. Heck, I created the topic of the debate. It’s not too, too hard to figure out! But if you insist…<br /><br />Vasten says: Lucid Vision isn’t a wannabe of anything. You, sir, are an idiot.<br /><br />That is the topic at hand. Has nothing to do with Tuskadon or any other coincidence, implication, or any other elaborate tangent you pull directly from your rear-end. I do hope we understand each other, though, knowing TangentMan, I somehow doubt it, again!<br /><br />Actually, let me make you sure understand crystal clear so there can be no miscommunication again. Here is a dumbed-down example (for yours truly – that’s you!) of precisely what I mean.<br /><br />George of the Jungle decides to trade in his furs and loincloth for an African Safari book. He shows it to his dear old friend, Mini Mouse. (Set thread: African Safari)<br /><br />Mini Mouse flips through the pages of the book and notices the hippopotamus! <br /><br />She explains to George, “Did you know that a hippopotamus farts through its mouth?” (Reference Nnuk!)<br /><br />George of the Jungle replies, “No! Do they really!?”<br /><br />This, my dimwitted friend, is called a “topic.”<br /><br />When Mini Mouse initiated a discussion about the hippopotamus, she created the topic. Much like when I debated your small-minded jab, I created the topic. So now you can hopefully understand what I mean precisely when I say, “Stick to the topic at hand.”<br /><br />Moving on in your lesson!  <img src="/ubbthreads/images/graemlins/laugh.gif" alt="" /><br /><br /></font><blockquote><font class="small">Quote:</font><hr /><br />Houston.. We have comprehension! Repeat: We have comprehension!<br /><br /><hr /></blockquote><font class="post"><br /><br />And not for nothing here, guy, but you do realize that you argued that *I* (how absolutely ludicrous!) veered of the thread because I refuse to read garbage from a person I consider to be completely void of intellect, and somehow profess that I don’t know what I’m talking about (As if..) and you’re referencing a – heres the good part! – COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THREAD?<br /><br />Do I look like Miss Cleo?!<br /><br /></font><blockquote><font class="small">Quote:</font><hr /><br />Um..

No mistaking that!<br /><br /></font><blockquote><font class="small">Quote:</font><hr /><br />I can only imagine how much more of a pain in the ass you'd be if I actually gave a shit about ya -- So no... It's not really hard to guess why folks aren't too quick to chime in.<br /><br /><hr /></blockquote><font class="post"><br /><br />As evidenced by your continuation of this thread. Just admit it, you’re a stubborn loser. No shame in that! Well.. err..<br /><br /></font><blockquote><font class="small">Quote:</font><hr /><br />It's not exactly like I'm in desperate need of assistance here.  <br /><br /><hr /></blockquote><font class="post"><br /><br />Actually, you do. I’d hire a lawyer to argue your case. He could do a much better job of spinning all that streaming bullshit that comes flying widely out of your hands. It might even make me think for a moment before I decide to respond to you. In this instance, like every other instance that I’ve replied to you, it’s not a matter of actually considering your position, but a matter of simply shooting down the many tangents you present in your style of posting. Not rocket science. More like basic arithmetic.<br /><br /><br /></font><blockquote><font class="small">Quote:</font><hr /><br />Your inability to grasp the points made does not render them non-existent, Vasten.<br /><br /><hr /></blockquote><font class="post"><br /><br />This just goes back into the nitpicking phase. Okay, so you claimed that LV was infact in range to HiV at their time of going PK. I have disputed that, stated the evidence supporting that, and your response is “Your inability to grasp the points made does not render them non-existent, Vasten.”?<br /><br />You just stick that hand of your up your ass and fish around for something that sounds controversial and pull it out, don’t you? Please Reference my, “You don’t have a clue what you’re talking about post(s).”  <img src="/ubbthreads/images/graemlins/grin.gif" alt="" /><br /><br /></font><blockquote><font class="small">Quote:</font><hr /><br />I say you're full of shit -- You disagree.<br /><br /><hr /></blockquote><font class="post"><br /><br />Yeah, pretty much like when you say you can defeat my character in EQ. I disagree with that, too. And again, I’m going to have to ask you to prove me wrong. And again, you’re not going to, like you didn’t last time or the time before that!<br /><br />You call that credibility? I call it a laughing catastrophe.  <img src="/ubbthreads/images/graemlins/bootyshake.gif" alt="" /><br /><br /></font><blockquote><font class="small">Quote:</font><hr /><br />Indeed -- Your behaviour in this thread has been a testament to that very fact.  <br /><br /><hr /></blockquote><font class="post"><br /><br />I can argue with a dimwit till the sun goes down. Doesn’t mean I care about them “personally.” Now, you tell me, how hard was that to understand, huh?<br /><br />lol<br /><br /></font><blockquote><font class="small">Quote:</font><hr /><br />You mentioned the name as if it were some sort of PvP legend -- I simply put it into proper perspective.<br /><br /><hr /></blockquote><font class="post"><br /><br />I did?<br /><br />Since when does someone have to be “Legendary” to defeat you? You simply mentioned Mearis and attached me to her somehow for my “anti” ways. I simply threw her into a category with 2 other people you have also mentioned – well, you might not have mentioned Malio and simply stated they, as well as gee.. I don’t know, my entire guild, could just mop the floor with your ass. Heck, I’m not even trying to be offensive.

I use you as an example because it’s fitting.<br /><br />Your whole game has always revolved around you being a newbie. ALWAYS. So you were a lvl 12 wizard that got killshots. Big fucking deal!?

You leveled to 54/55? Note the difference, please. Anyone with a working brain can figure out the substantial difference between you and I. Like I said!

I've been called every name in the book by hundreds (thousands?) of people over the years -- One more isn't gonna make any difference.<br /><br /><hr /></blockquote><font class="post"><br /><br />Someone get the old man a cane and a consolation prize!<br /><br /></font><blockquote><font class="small">Quote:</font><hr /><br />People that chose the PK lifestyle from the getgo (as opposed to the pissants that left AD-Lite and such out of boredom) find sitting around waiting for a MOB to pop incredibly tedious. <br /><br /><hr /></blockquote><font class="post"><br /><br />Okay, I see you use this line of arguing overly often in your wordy little posts but I think its time that I shot this one down, too. Allow me to explain..<br /><br />Look at the history of PK’s. We’ll start with Darkenbane, okay? Follow closely.<br /><br />Darkenbane at their most powerful raided. They did it on Rallos, they did it on Sullon. Now, lets look at their predecessor. House In’Visus – notice these people <i>also</i> raided, k? Lets take a look at Reign of Pain now. They <i>also</i> made an effort to raid and camp those tedious mobs! Lucid Vision was no different. Your own guild – not much different, as evidenced by their attendance at our raids when we raided. That said, do you really think (majority speaking of course) wants to have a shit end character with nothing of value to show for it? That’s TIME they put into their character. Of course they want to advance with it, just like Hamadryad did. Just like Tuggo did. Just like Cougr did. And who else is in your guild that’s actually active?<br /><br />I state facts, you just look for the justification on your own negligence. And you talk about leveling being tedious. You’re damn right, it IS tedious. But I’m more inclined to think there is a reason why you STOPPED leveling at 55 instead of lets say.. 56. Anyone with half a brain cell would agree with me.  <img src="/ubbthreads/images/graemlins/smile.gif" alt="" /><br /><br /></font><blockquote><font class="small">Quote:</font><hr /><br />But, at the end of the day (or the Legends subscription, as the case may be), what's left is one bored motherfucker who is sick to death of being trained when he PvPs and told to "focus on leveling" when he isn't.<br /><br /><hr /></blockquote><font class="post"><br /><br />No one likes to level, shit for brains. It’s boring. You do it to better your character, just like you did for 55 levels. Other people go the extra mile because they don’t mind being in 60 range for the betterment of their character. Or 65 range, as that is how it is now.<br /><br /></font><blockquote><font class="small">Quote:</font><hr /><br />So yeah.. More than a few of 'em came to see the ghost/n00b/whatever to get my opinion on what they should do to start having fun again.<br /><br /><hr /></blockquote><font class="post"><br /><br />I remember one example of this. Psycholistic having a conversation with you about being in 60 range, and him telling me you told him..<br /><br />“You’d have to be crazy to level into 60 range!” and he agreed with you.<br /><br />And I disagreed and said, “Level up bitch! We need some wizahds!” (in a friendly way of course, because Psycho rules!)<br /><br /></font><blockquote><font class="small">Quote:</font><hr /><br />Why? Cause I've been around forever and I've already forgotten more about MMORPGs than you'll ever learn.<br /><br /><hr /></blockquote><font class="post"><br /><br />Oh.<br /><br />Okay? Not sure what I’m supposed to say here? You’re cool? What?? <img src="/ubbthreads/images/graemlins/wink.gif" alt="" /><br /><br /></font><blockquote><font class="small">Quote:</font><hr /><br />If memory serves (and it usually does. ;-)) that message you sent was after I stepped in and blew some fuckwit (was it Mearis? I'm not curious enough to look it up... Yet.) to smithereens for verbally raping you and your guildies (again) with the very same arguments you're trying to use on me in this thread, tough guy.<br /><br /><hr /></blockquote><font class="post"><br /><br />Memory would serve you wrong, then. I generally didn’t argue with Mearis simply because we had an understanding of each other. We duked it out in game (something you’re more or less devoid of doing) in a duel(s). There isn’t ONE instance that you have indirectly or directly assisted me in an argument. I wouldn’t even assume to use such a blatant lie on this thread. As if I need your ‘help’ (if you wanna call it that) defending my guild or self. (laugh)<br /> <br />You’re taking a compliment of your posts regarding other people and turning it into something that it is simply not. It’s not that you have some Ultra Points in your posts that makes it baffling to argue with you. You simply don’t and the few ‘points’ that you do try to profess are simply not difficult to mock, enlighten others on, and generally smash. It’s just the style of your posting that I complimented you on simply because its unique as far as posters go. If you are somehow getting the impression that I “want to be Nnuk” then you’re sadly mistaken! So you chalk that up as victory, I just tell the truth. I’ve already explained this before!<br /><br /></font><blockquote><font class="small">Quote:</font><hr /><br />... One would assume a certain level of sincerety since the comment was not sollicited and there was precious little to be gained by making it.<br /><br /><hr /></blockquote><font class="post"><br /><br />It was also at a time that you sent me a message stating..<br /><br />“You might want to drop by the RZ.net board and take a peek at the OOC section at a post entitled “alts of LV” allegedly by Guznuk”<br /><br />Hey, you scratch my back, I scratch yours. I’m a nice guy.<br /><br />Don’t over flatter yourself. Not when you’re pretty much just flat out wrong!<br /><br /></font><blockquote><font class="small">Quote:</font><hr /><br />... Quite the 180, eh? A suspicious individual might get the impression that you're grasping at straws in an effort at saving face.<br /><br /><hr /></blockquote><font class="post"><br /><br />Nonsense. What I said makes perfect sense! What you say is redundant babble.<br /><br />I’ve grown accustomed to this with you, though, so by all means..<br /> <br /></font><blockquote><font class="small">Quote:</font><hr /><br />ps I'm getting bored here, Vast. <br /><br /><hr /></blockquote><font class="post"><br /><br />So stop posting then, Einstein! No one is holding a gun to your head. You'll also have to give me something more interesting to go on rather than the various tangents you seem to create from thin air. (Refer above to "transperant arguments")<br /><br />I simply maintain that you’re an idiot, that’s all.  <img src="/ubbthreads/images/graemlins/shocked.gif" alt="" /><br /><br />Later, TangentMan!  <img src="/ubbthreads/images/graemlins/bootyshake.gif" alt="" /><br />

Cliff notes for my last post!<br /><br />1. Nnuk disputes what a topic is. I correct him.<br /><br />2. I explain why taking another thread and somehow making that relevant to this thread to fuel a futile argument is a dumb thing to do.<br /><br />3. I dismiss more Nnuk bullshit.<br /><br />4. Call him a cockroach in-game, board warrior out of game.<br /><br />5. Let him know that he should find a proper attorney to argue the "points" that he is devoid of making himself (they can spin better than him)<br /><br />6. Also let him know that by sticking ones hand up ones ass and calling it a "point" doesn't necessarily make that claim true.<br /><br />7. Mock his credibility.<br /><br />8. Laugh hysterically at him for even thinking he could kill me in game.<br /><br />9. Continue to laugh hysterically!<br /><br />10. ...still laughing!  <img src="/ubbthreads/images/graemlins/bootyshake.gif" alt="" /><br /><br />11. Mock his Everfrost nostalgia.<br /><br />12. Let him know that there is a substantial difference between level 55 and level 61 as far as leveling goes, and playerbase involved.<br /><br />13. Request that he get a glass belly button so when his head is up his ass for prolonged periods of time, he can still see what I'm writing and hopefully still be able to reply.<br /><br />14. Also let him know (by request) that not only do my guildmates and antis support what I'm saying, but also PK's as well.<br /><br />15. Explain that I <b>really</b> did feel sorry for him. (I'm a softy.)<br /><br />16.  Suggest a cane for the old geezard and a consolation prize.<br /><br />17. Go in detail about the history of PK guilds, and that all of them (known guilds) did infact raid. A claim that he really can't dispute -- but probably will. That's inc tonight, though.<br /><br />18.  Also explain that its not just a coincidence that he stopped leveling at 55, as evidenced by my reference to Psycholistic. (see above post)<br /><br />19.  Let him know that he is taking a compliment out of its proper context. You can only glorify something so much, afterall.<br /><br />20. Let him know that he's a babbler.<br /><br />21. Dismiss him as TangentMan, and take my leave until tomorrow.<br /><br />That's about it, guys. You'll just have to read the post for more indepth knowledge!<br /><br />Many apologies for the size of my posts. Somethings need to be worded correctly so there is zero miscommunication. If you need something constantly dumbed-down for you, don't keep reading my posts.  <img src="/ubbthreads/images/graemlins/laugh.gif" alt="" />

Vasten, were you really a PK for 61 levels? I had no idea you were in Darkenbane, either. That's good trivia, indeed. <br /><br />This argument sounds interesting, but I think you guys are losing the majority of the readers with the 17+ paragraph posts. How about keeping it more brief so those of us in the peanut gallery can chime in every now and then with some whimsical comments?

In an effort at being as fair as humanly possible in this instance I'll refrain from writing any of these notes myself.<br /><br />Instead I'll simply refer you to 2 comments made by other -- uninvolved -- individuals and one made by Vasten himself. Hopefully you'll get a feel for what's what from that:<br /><br /></font><blockquote><font class="small">Quote:</font><hr /><br />Guilds like AD-lite called Lucid Vision lowbies, and said they were crappy players in general because of their chosen play style. <br /><br />Rather than to set an example, Lucid Vision simply did the same towards guilds like Artful Death, HIV, ROP...well whatever.<br /><br /><hr /></blockquote><font class="post"><br /><br />... By the lovely Hamadryad -- Accurately stating the crux of my issue with Vasten with the exception that I was talking about him personally... Not his guild.<br /><br />And...<br /><br /></font><blockquote><font class="small">Quote:</font><hr /><br />No offense Vasten but man you are sure sounding worse than them poons {Ad-Lites,MIMS}<br /><br /><hr /></blockquote><font class="post"><br /><br />... By the irrepressible Tare -- Which echo'ed my sentiment regarding all this blue tinted "lvl up &amp; OMG duel me PLZ!" bullshit which has been spewing from the self-styled PK God. :-)<br /><br />As for Vasten's contribution... A whole lotta posturing meant to show us how little he cares about what I say/do (yet his posts make mine seem short by comparison! lol) when, in actuality, we all know how he really feels:<br /><br /><img src="http://www.artfuldeath.com/galleries_current/nnuk/misc/posts/pics/totally_outclassed.jpg"><br /><br />Artfully Yours,<br /><br />Nnuk<br />Master of the Arts<br /><a href="http://www.artfuldeath.com" target="_blank">Artful Death Gallery</a><br /><br />PS Joking aside.. Just look at the first few posts, people. I posted a response to something Tuskadon said and Rhawn seemed to take offense so I wrote a light-hearted clarification and then BAMM! The next day I check the board to see Vasten thumping his chest over shit he (admittedly) didn't understand -- Then all Hell broke loose.<br /><br />For the first time in years... I'm actually the victim here! lolol

That's good trivia, indeed. <br /><br />This argument sounds interesting, but I think you guys are losing the majority of the readers with the 17+ paragraph posts. How about keeping it more brief so those of us in the peanut gallery can chime in every now and then with some whimsical comments?<br /><br /><hr /></blockquote><font class="post"> <br /><br />Geez.<br /><br />We do have some lazy readers. You guys want me to cliff note.. cliff notes. That's hilarious. Anyway.. few things. Not you, personally, Scurry. Though, I know the size of my posts are generally long. I hate when there is any confusion in my words, though.<br /><br />Yes, I was in Darkenbane. I think Hamadryad can verify that. Was I a PK for my entire history? Thats open for debate and speculation. When I turned level 44 I went to LV and played Nenlain until Lucid Vision went PK. Still played Nenlain for a few months and then decided to level my druid again and PK with him.<br /><br />No response to Nnuk unless he wants to respond to my post. Also note "<i>FOR</i> yours truly" not <b>from</b> yours truly.<br /><br />But I am curious on his interpretation of my raiding discussion in regards to PK guilds history of raiding.<br /><br />...dumbass.  <img src="/ubbthreads/images/graemlins/bootyshake.gif" alt="" /><br />

That's what made it so funny. See: You can add "to", "from", "for", "by" or "superqualifrajalisticexpialedocious", if ya like -- But no matter how many horsefeathers you pile onto it there's very little you can do to convince anyone with an IQ superior to that of a retarded gnat that "yours truly" doesn't mean "me".<br /><br />So... To recap:<br /><br />FOR  <i>yours truly</i> = FOR <i>me</i>.<br /><br />If I may suggest, lad...

Please note, that I am making this reply to you because you addressed me. I also happened to read your post and I'm left feeling somewhat baffled. Mainly because I don't remember *EVER* talking to you. I didn't "browbeat" your opinion about Jack or Shit. Heck, I didn't even <i>know</i> you. I saw you around with ROP here and there. Thats it.<br /><br />I've never had anything that remotely resembled a conversation with you in game. I know you only from these board posts you make. I read all of 5 of them before I decided you were so fucking dumb I wouldn't even amuse myself by reading your posts. Please don't act as if you and I had heated discussions in game about the "way things should be" as if we reminisced like old college chums and I really gave a fucking shit what you thought.<br /><br />No offense, but I hate it when people try to imply something that isn't true to garner attention. It's pathetic.<br /><br />EDIT: And I don't remember EVER telling you to "shut the fuck up." If anything, I had a fairly cordial relationship with Dessimus and I always treated his members with respect. And what do you mean "when ROP and LV were allies"? You obviously don't know what you're talking about because LV never allied ROP and if you won't take my word for it you can take it up with Mangar. He'll rightfully laugh at you. Ally is a real strong word.<br /><br /> <img src="/ubbthreads/images/graemlins/tongue.gif" alt="" />

Heh, I couldn't resist checking this thread after Vasten pointed it out to me in game <img src="/ubbthreads/images/graemlins/smile.gif" alt="" />  Brings back some good memories of trash talking battles I enjoyed getting myself into.<br /><br />A few things, LV and AD (and AD for the rest of this post shall refer to the small guild Artful Death, not the widely known Ascending Dawn) were two totally different kind of guilds.<br /><br />LV was trying to become a force to be reckoned with on a very hostile server, while AD was happy tagging along on LV raids and never accomplish anything PvP-PvE wise.<br /><br />Which brings me to my next point:  What is an accomplishment?<br /><br />While Vasten and I mostly see I to eye on this issue, Nnuk has his own point of view (possibly shared by Lova the lowbie) on what it means to PvP.<br /><br />For me PvP'ing means to confront myself in fair battle against other people, to drive people out of zone, to fight against the most skilled opponents available.  While I enjoy the PvE portion of the game, I was fairly unique among my guild (with the exception of Coan) in that I actively seeked out PvP, and I was probably the person who killed the most LV members.  Vasten on the other hand didn't actively enjoy the PvE game, for him, levelling was a slow chore, but one he gladly did for a chance to measure himself against RZ's finest PvP'ers.<br /><br />You can claim what you will Nnuk, but none of the people who you ganked in Everfrost had the same expertise as you, quite simply because for most anti's (and I exclude the roleplaying fanatics) all level's until the top were transitory, and with the added zones levelling up was never easier.<br /><br />How many of the people that you'd nuke while kiting ice-giants would wear full resists gear, and throw any non lure spell you tossed at them?  How many carried entire bags of golem rods?  How many had stinging wort potions, cure disease/tash potions hotkey'd in their inventory?  How many knew how to step back into a cast after being SoL'd or much less circle cast?<br /><br />This is a game we play for fun, but frankly killing folks with 1/1000th of the experience and game knowledge that I do is no fun, while my tooth and nail fights against Shoon were real nail-biters with both people playing ranged games, and lasting a really long time.  I believe we were 1-1 as far as kills on each other went, out of the countless fights I had.<br /><br />What you fail to point out is that to Vasten, having PvE aspirations was a show of PvP strength, assuming you had to defend each raid you did from a few rabid PvP'ers like me Malio, Coan, Faamarki and a fwe others would always try to rain down to on their parade.<br /><br />I have fought against Vasten numerous times, and I have only witnessed you fight once, ever in a PvP situation.  Vasten *NEVER* backs down from challenges, he delights on them, you on the other hand whenever you are challenged (I myself offered you a choice of 6 vs 6 sub 55, 1 on 1 agaisnt my monk numerous times) you unless a flurry of rhetorics to try and distract people from the point of you refusing a fight and change the topic to something random.<br /><br />I have no doubt you'll do the same this time, and come up with some verbose explanation for why you avoid any sort of pre-planned fight where a retreat would equal a loss for you.<br /><br />Mearis<br /><br />PS<br />Hammy, the one time Gena got me was when I asked you if Gena was OK and you told me he was the guy who ported you, therefore I assumed he was a friend of yours and wouldn't attack, plus I had sound off and didn't notice at all being ice-cometed 6 times <img src="/ubbthreads/images/graemlins/smile.gif" alt="" />  I am sure you remember this as well.<br /><br />PPS<br />The only time I have ever witnessed Nnuk fight, was when me and Atsuko were going around looking for some PvP, and stumbled into Nnuk in EverFrost, and after looking for him we found him hidden inside the rock behind the PoK stone nuking people as they were clicking down from PoK.  I have no words for how cowardly nuking people from inside a graphic glitch is, but the funny part is that you ended up gating from Atsuko's druid without having done a smidget of its health.  Your choice of spell selection speaks highly of your PvP skills and your usual choice of PvP opponents, ice-comet, followed by voltaic draught, when PvP'ing against a druid :/<br />

Nice dodge Nnuk :/  For the record, even though I already explained you once, I shall take the time to explain it to you again.<br /><br />Dmaximov is a fairly old school druid, who when he quit, left his account to two very good friends, Symgharl &amp; Atsuko.  Atsuko hardly ever played Dmaximov until relatively recently, and Symgharl only used it to PL alts.<br /><br />When Atsuko finally got control of the account, he got Dmaximov both solstice earrings, an SS BP, and his epic using his crew of characters.<br /><br />So, the Dmaximov you killed was probably Symgharl powerlevelling an alternate character, and I very much doubt you'd hold a candle to Dmaximov played by Atsuko.<br /><br />For the record, Atsuko plays Atsuko, Juliana, Kelgar, Dmaximov and a few other lesser known PvP characters.

Hang on a sec Vasten, was that sarcasm?  It better have been sarcasm...<br /><br />I find nothing wrong with character advancement, but I really DONT think people like Nnuk who DISLIKE and don't have the free time for it should be called bad pvpers.  Fact of the matter is Mearis that Nnuk wears every peice of gear he can that he took from his models, and maybe this Dmax-whoever character had better gear but that doesn't mean shit.

Actually, I haven't worn an apothic robe in over two years or so.  I have been wearing a Thurgadim Robe for a while, then after passing on 5 or 6 SS robes in raids lead by me I finally got one after all our casters already had one, so I have been wearing an SS robe for close to a year.<br /><br />It does have a graphic similar to Apothic, but they look fairly different expecially with new models.<br /><br />

Otherwise you're just another lowbie shmuck that peddals with newbies all day long. Nnuk could be the best wizard PKer there ever has been, but how well would he do against Shoon? Against Faamarki? Take your pick of upper end characters. They'll all blow him away. Is that a reflection of his PvP skill? No. Is it a reflection of his PvP strength? Absolutely. Think of it this way.<br /><br />You may be the best PK ranger there ever has been. Lonoorn on the other hand would drop you -- point, blank, and period. You may know how to play a ranger better. That don't matter. The simple fact is, <i>he can beat you.</i><br /><br />It's not a reflection of your skill to be getting housed by someone that so outrageously outgears you, but it <i>IS</i> a reflection of your PvP strength if all the top dog rangers can smash you. It puts you low on the food chain. <br /><br />The greater your PvE game is, the greater your PvP strength is. It goes in that order. AD is the strongest PvE guild there is on RZ. Therefore, they are also the strongest PvP guild there is. Thats indisputable. Wudan or MiM is second and third. They're also the 2nd and 3rd strongest PvP guild there is. Not disputable. I'm not sitting here harping about these guilds -- I dislike each of them, but these are facts here people. Dispute them all you want but you'll just be in denial.

Calling them a PvP guild though is debatable seeings we know where their true love of the game comes from beating the mobs verant throws at them and getting cooler stuff.<br /><br />They may be good in pvp due to their pve, but make no mistake, that doesn't make a pvp guild.

Uulos that is absolutely not true.<br /><br />Lets take two level 65s for example like you stated. One has uber gear with no skill,and other has BD shit with skill.<br /><br />Whose going to win ??? The one that sucks at pvp with the uber gear.<br /><br />Why because he has better resists,massive ass sick ass hps.<br /><br />It's all about gear,there isn't much skill in EQ pvp when it comes to someone that out gears the other person.<br /><br />You should know this due to the fact you run around twinked up the ass smacking newbies with leather tunics on silly.<br /><br />Hey this isn't a put down. I do the same shit on my twink has over 50k of gear on her so whose the schooler ???<br /><br />I don't care about who has skill and who doesn't. The one with the better gear is going to win always.<br /><br />Take two level 34 SKs for example. First SK has uber gear, {Fungi,IGS,belt of turtle,LOdiz on back}and swings a MDS.<br /><br />2nd SK is wearing shit like Black alloy and swinging a Moss.<br /><br />So tell me where skill comes into place here. Yeah the SK with the MOSS is going to get his ass kicked bad.<br /><br />I veto all this shit about skill. Its about gear <br /><br />Verant doesn't care about the zeks,so they are not about to change it for us pvp lovers.  <br /><br />Vasten correct I agree that you do have to have PVE strength to be better at PVP.<br /><br />But the only reason he is stating this  is because the better you are at handling mobs,and raids the more uber gear you are going to get.<br /><br />Thats all RZ is about,gear !!! SAd but true<br /><br />So what it all comes down to is ADlite,MIM are all gear,and nothing but gear.<br /><br />Sure they may know how to PVP but they will always have the advantage over the pker due to the fact they can get the gear needed to be on top.<br /><br />PVE strength =handling mobs<br /><br />PVP strength =Geared

why I chose to stick with lowlevels.  My main, 35 cleric, can hold his own against most hybrids and casters even with uber gear, even though I have to avoid most melees.  At 25, my chanter can school anyone.  Uber gear or not.  DMG caps are still in place and resists are still rather low at this point.  <br /><br />LEVEL and GEAR do indeed make a difference in PVP.

skill in pvp? really very little.. its a lot more situational, gear, and how well you know your class.. if thats skill sure, but I dont know. I call it knowledge.<br /><br />if you're jousting, sure that is skill, but a big 2hander against a duel wielder is going to get owned almost regardless of skill.. unless you have a complete newb and someone extremely effecient at jousting<br /><br />otherwise its situation/gear.. if you have a SK with a sog in a small room, and a wizard... something tells me the wizard wont make it out alive.. but if you have a SK (without lev up) in say everfrost (;x) against that same levving wizard... the sk will be eaten up.. unless gear comes into play.. where either the wizard has enough HP to take the hits while he channels nukes/ac high enough, or the Sk has high enough resists to make the nukes futile.  this is all excluding broken-pvp such as horses and mb though..  honestly the only skill-oriented pvp i have found is when you make some level one characters and run around jousting.. <br />but then adlite would have quit a long time ago.
