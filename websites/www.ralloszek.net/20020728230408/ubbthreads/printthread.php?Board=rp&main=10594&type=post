This post is purely out of character.<br /><br />I apologize for beginning something that I cannot finish. I cannot finish this story.<br /><br />I apologize especially to Sir Descourg for all the entertwining we have done that I must leave now, and hope that he continues on with stories of his character and his interesting family.  I truly admire him for his imagination, and will always be looking here for more from him.  I hope to see more from Lulee and Sir Kelleher, also, and anyone else who chooses to share stories here.  It would be nice to hear from Spiritraven again.  I find her story in-game to show a lot of imagination, wicked pk though she is.  (Just joking, Spiritraven)<br /><br />My heart is not in Carezzia anymore, though I do not have a reason onto which I can grasp and explain well.  I have never enjoyed the game as a game and maybe that is the best reason I can find.  What I have loved, though, are the roleplayers from various guilds I have met and bandied words with during my journey.  <br /><br />Roleplayers are few and far between, but I was lucky to have met a great many of them.  I consider myself lucky to have been granted glimpses into their wit and imagination.<br /><br />I have missed all those people these last 10 to 15 levels.  My path seems to go in other directions and now I find I never see them anymore. The stories that, in the past, would begin with others have just stopped beginning.<br /><br />As everyone knows, when you reach your 50's, life on Norrath becomes a confusion you either hate or love.  There are constant raids and groups and epic questing and trying to keep up with everyone else. If you can type in two words while you are trying to snare, or heal without someone dying, you can count yourself lucky, especially with 20 people casting and shouting orders around you. And, even if you do manage it, most likely you will not get a reply. I have found less roleplaying among these last 10 levels than any so far along the way. <br /><br />This past month especially, I have found myself leaving Norrath at the end of my stays, realizing I did not really have fun.  Although I am not online as much as most of the people I know, I have to ask myself why I spend the time I AM here doing something I have not been enjoying.<br /><br />So, it is not just this story, or my character, Carezzia, my heart is not into......it is Norrath in general.  I cannot totally leave, because I have too many friends I wish to keep up with.  At the same time, I do not think Carezzia will actually roleplay much anymore, or have an ongoing story or background.<br /><br />Have fun, and keep writing.  As it is with me, I am sure to some of you writing is not just a hobby, but an addiction.<br /><br /><br />Sherri<br />The Player of Carezzia
