Mleh, wanna do me a favor pal and check the date you took that screenshot? Something in that screenshot doesn't look right to me-would really appreciate if you could get the date it was taken....<br><br>Oh, btw-lotta people are braggin and whatnot how they have killed me way back in blah blah blah. Yes, I was killed many times when I had crappy gear, +50hp total on my gear, base mr of 40 and shitty weapons. It has not been until recently I had saved up enough to buy some half decent gear. Sure I do die occasionally to groups of bastard level 24 naked casters who hunt me down which most of my guildies can't attack, even with my equipment today.<br><br>It's not a huge accomplishment to slay me considering my resists are still below what they should be, I have no jboots or regen tunic-I'm a warrior and have no evade skills (gate shadowstep) I don't have the time nor effort to get max REAL good gear. But yet I am still feared in many a zone, I can still beat twinks higher level then myself, I may not be the best PK, but I sure consider myself to be good at pvp. I also still die rarely when I don't want to. (you may think otherwise if you have seen me in hph from time to time, going on suicide missions to lose exp, so I don't make 21)<br><br>If you like to talk of how invincible you are mleh how about I bring up some names from the past. Do the names Firooz or Xoraq ring a bell? Coulda sworn you were crying to the zone about how they were corpse camping you, and killing you over and over again (all though I save my screenshots for more important things) think it was about the 5th time you ran back from your bind spot, you finally got out of the zone after looting your corpse and camped?<br><br>If, or I suppose when I call you a newbie I am not reffering to your equipment, ability to kill others ect (you're actually quite decent at pvp, although your jousting with a troll needs some work) I am referring to  your general lack of knowledge of the high end game. Who's still the one that thinks 100% haste would make a weapon have 0 delay? /chuckle<br><br>btw I would love to have my main on rallos for a day at least!
