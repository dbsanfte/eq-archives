--What to do, what to do?  It is not my custom to go where I am not comfortable and without clear invitation but, the fabled Carezzia has requested (ordered, begged, demanded) that I move my small tales to this most noble of forums.  It is one of my failings that I deny my favorites of very few of their requests.  Ah, but the tale is long, some three full arcs already, tens of thousands of words, and I am a stickler for continuity and foreshadowing.  What to do, what to do?  So, a compromise of sorts--I give you a bit of  prologue (probably incomprehensible), tiny fragments of the whole.  And, should these tales prove too burdensome and poorly crafted for the august company the fable Carezzia has thrust me into, I shall retire quietly upon request.  <br><br>Behold:  that which has gone before--<br><br>[Descourge returns to the friends of his childhood after an absence of several decades]--     The man, or whatever it was that the foliage revealed, was crouched forward, kneeling beneath a heavy cloak.  He leaned against a worn farmer's scythe, the tools recurving blade forming what Kaolinn had at first perceived as the switchback limb.  Between the heavy leathered cloak and the grey hair that fell to nearly the man's waist--unkempt and wild, almost like a mane formed of feathers--he appeared even less descript than the tree which preceded him.<br>     The paladin chose the pitch of his voice carefully, stern but not overly aggressive.  "Sir?  Sir, are you well?"<br>     The reaction was unexpected and extreme.  The man surged to his feet, head thrown back, shoulders high, his arms thrust far away from his body, the fingers of his free hand spread wide like claws.  He released a growl that escalated rapidly through the menacing hiss of a snake to the feral challenge of an injured puma.<br>     At the final sound, Kaolinn relaxed slightly, memory lending comfort.  This was no immediate threat.  "Des?" he inquired tentatively.  At the name, the man swiveled his head, birdlike, toward the speaker.  The man's facial hair was as wild and overgrown as the rest.  His face was scarred with windburn and his skin had almost a blue pallor.  When he slowly opened his eyes, Kaolinn could see that they were a milk white, unseeing.  The man blinked his blind eyes twice and then, to Kaolinn's amazement, the opaque film broke lose at the top of the eyes and slid beneath the lower eyelid to reveal hollow grey eyes split with the vertical pupils of a cat.<br>     "Nictitating membrane?" the paladin whispered in disbelief.  The other man's reply was physical, he collapsed in on himself, lowering his head, pulling his arms back to the core of his body.  He dipped his head into the crook of his shoulder and turned partially away.<br>     "Des, I'm not an animal.  I need you to speak to me if you want me to understand."<br>     If the reply was in words, it was no language used by men.  The one called Des thrust out his jaw and released a series of almost musical noises, like elongated bird calls, his larynx bobbing in his throat, straining at sounds not meant for human voice.  Seeing no comprehension, the druid switched to another tongue, this one harsh, guttural and sibilant but still unknown to his listener.<br>     "Come on, Des.  You should remember this."<br>     The druid favored Kaolinn with a disapproving glare before speaking in a rough, faded whisper.  "The language of pain.  It is not my preference." <br><br>[The displaced Ancient, having extreme difficulty returning to the human world, seeks advice from his family]--     Descourge stood, shrouded in the fog at the front of the little house, and wished he was a boy again.  He wished that he could run to his mother like a frightened child with a skinned knee that she would kiss and, once again, everything would be right within his world.  Then he grimaced at the lies he told himself.  He had been a Surefall orphan--Surefall:  the distant place where the elite of Felwithe sent their disgraced daughters to whelp their half-breed mistakes and then return, forgetful, to their cultured, uncluttered lives.  He had grown to manhood with no mother, no father beyond Karana, only trainers and the beasts.  As a young druid, he had traveled the world, looking for answers to fill that one, great, gaping hole which he could not even define.  In the frozen wastes, he had found a measure of peace.  On the great plains and the desert sands, he had found the clean pleasures of the hunt.  In the so-called homeland of the elfin peoples, he found disdain and oh-so-polite condescension.   And eventually, among the fading ruins of a forgotten people, among a race as orphaned as he, Descourge had found a place and a family, not of blood, but of choice.  It was here, in the mists of the woods of Lesser Feydark, that Joleena had found room in her heart for one more foundling and named him son and member of the fairy court.<br>     He knocked once then opened the door into the mushroom building.  Stooping, he stepped inside.  "Mother?"<br>     "In the kitchen, Dessie."  The reply was in the lilting speech of the fairy and, unconsciously, Descourge switched to the ancient tongue.  He moved to join her in the other room.<br>     "Presents," the druid commented and placed a packet on the table in the center of the small dining room.  Delicately, he kissed his mother on a blue cheek.  Joleena was barely a fifth of her son's height, her skin the blue of a spring sky, her hair the golden flax of corn silks, and two small wings fluttered on her back, bearing her aloft.  Despite their physical differences, the ease with which they moved and spoke with the other made it clear that they were family. /snip/<br>     To his surprise, his mother laughed at his discomfort.  "You and I are too much alike.  Your children are grown.  Your duties are done.  Your house is empty.  You've earned the rest but you don't know how to not be doing something.  Oh, Dessie, I do understand all too well."<br>/snip/<br>     "All right then.  I'm sorry, Mother.  I must go."<br>     "Be careful," she whispered and kissed him quickly on the cheek.  "I'll send your attendants on ahead."<br>     "I don't need attendants."<br>     "I'll not hear of it.  You are a noble of the court.  It gives them honor to serve you.  Now hurry off, I'll drink your tea for you."<br>     "Thank you," he replied with a sad smile and strode purposefully from the house.<br>     Joleena watched him go in silence then muttered to herself, "I'm not sure that one will ever be settled."<br><br>[The Ancient begins to pursue matters related to ancient obligations and the fey court, specific among these, the location of Carezzia who's relevance to the Fairy is not revealed]-- I didn't know how I was going to find Carezzia; I wasn't even sure she needed finding.  Sometimes a man follows his gut and thinks it through later. <br>/snip/ <br>Sooner or later, every druid, maybe everyone else too for all I know, has to go looking for themselves.  We call it the Green, named after the emerald flash at twilight, but it really is a vision-quest with very few set limits.  The reason is simple:  at some point as a druid grows up, they stop being who their trainers and family taught them to be, and they start being who they are.  Even if it turns out to be exactly the same, after the Green, after they go away and "re-find" themselves, it's by choice rather than default.  It's dangerous, especially for the unprepared, but necessary.<br><br>My own passage occurred too young.  I barely survived and parts of my soul are twisted so bad they'll never straighten out.  I wasn't sure if Care was ready or not.  Her departure was much too sudden and emotional for my liking.  I figured if she was ready and I caught up, she'd smile and send me home.  If she wasn't, well, at least I know the pain of growing up too fast.  I had to try--for her and for myself.<br><br>I'm Karana's boy and fey to boot.  Carezzia was neither and I was out of my league.  The passage through the Green physically would mirror the spiritual nature of the traveler and Care was nothing like me.  Even as the Ancient of Days, I was going to need help with this one.<br><br>[While the Ancient is distracted with family matters, the Princess Joleena  manages to 'direct' Carezzia to her where the fairy pursues her own agenda]<br><br>The fairy favored Carezzia with a matronly frown.  "Let us set your mind to ease.  You are here for a reason and we do have a use for you but only if you are willing.  We do have your best interests at heart, so long as they do not conflict with our's, and we are more than willing to assist you with your own travails so long as the cost to us is not great.  First, let us begin with you."<br><br>The fairy cocked her head to one side and gazed at Carezzia like a bird before continuing.  "Understand, there are only two true things:  origins and definitions.  The what of a thing and from whence it came.  It is our surmise, Lady Carezzia, that you are unclear on both of these things, regarding yourself.  So tell me, young one, who are you truly and where do you come from?  Perhaps then you may tell us what we may do for you."<br><br>Carezzia sat in uncomfortable silence, pinned under the fairy's gaze, her tea cooling forgotten before her. <br><br>/snip/<br><br>"You must forgive our amusement," the fairy told Carezzia, smiling.  "It is simply that, as you bemoan the extreme preservation of your innocence, we are reminded of another who stood before us long ago lamenting the lose of his childhood.  Still, we are appreciative of your plight.<br><br>"We would first remind you that there are two true things.  Origin alone does not dictate destiny.  Remember, no matter where you have come from, how you chose to define yourself in the present and the future is your choice.  Indeed, young one, you should be prepared should you never learn the full truth of your childhood.  If that possibility is too threatening to you, perhaps you are not ready to learn.<br><br>"And, as you go, ask questions of yourself.  Wonder at that which does not fit within the context of what you know.  Why, if your mentor was a bard, did he raise both you and his daughter as druids?  Why would a bard live in the fastness of the wilderness, a wilderness, we might add, which is regularly visited by the Ancient, whose hatred of bards is well known?  Why would your relatives give you to him to raise?  So many questions you must ask."<br><br>Carezzia leapt verbally into the fairy's pause.  "He had a daughter?"<br><br>"Indeed, a lovely thing, much like yourself.  We fear there is little gain in that avenue of investigation.  She married young and moved away, dead now many years.  Still, it is not the finding of truths which concerns us.  We are most certain that, in time, you will have your answers.  Our concern is what you will do with these knowledges when you have them.<br><br>"For that, we would normally advise that you seek council from an elder of your own peoples.  Our inquiries have discovered, however, that your people have no Ancient.  More accurately, your Ancient is none other that the Ancient of the Fey Court itself.  We commend you, therefore, to consult with the High Priest of the Court itself."<br><br>The young druid was confused.  Perhaps she had lost her train of though in the fairy's persistent use of the imperial 'we' or perhaps she was expected to reach a conclusion on her own, Carezzia did not know.  Instead she asked directly.  "Forgive me, your grace, but, who is this Ancient?"<br><br>The fairy laughed aloud.  "The Ancient of Days.  It has been so long that we had forgotten that he has another name.  In truth, Ancient of Days began as little more than a nickname and became his title."<br><br>"What does it mean?"<br><br>The fairy waved a  dismissive hand at the question.  "His story to tell, if he chooses.  To answer your question, dear, the Ancient of Days is your Descourge.  When you are ready, we advise that you seek him out.  He is a great solace in times of uncertainty and made wise by his own pain."<br><br>Carezzia hesitated before replying.  "I'm not sure that he will speak with me.  Descourge's relationship with the guild has been…strained."<br><br>"Oh, child, we wish that you understood.  Of course he will speak with you.  It is for you and the others like you that he exists.  The guild has been an instrument of rendering him great pain and his current sojourn comes at high personal cost.  Is it so unreasonable that he be demanding and difficult?  But we assure you, his devotion is unquestioned for all the brusqueness he affects."  The fairy hesitated, lost in her own thoughts for a moment.  "My son is like the thistle--all the thorns and briar to protect the too-soft heart.  He is Karana's son with Tunare's heart.<br><br>"But," the fey noble continued, "We think that you are afraid of him."<br><br>Carezzia nodded slightly and did not speak.<br><br>"In that, you may be justified for he is mercurial and given to horrid moods.  Take this."  The fairy placed a pebble in the druid's hand closing the girls fingers around it, forcing her to hold it.  The stone was smooth as though from a creek and it had the mottled brown coloration of the same.<br><br>"Thank you, your grace, but what is it?"<br><br>"A memory.  A moment plucked from the rivers of time and held apart."  The gentle feys smile became suddenly malicious.  "In case he has forgotten himself.  Beyond this, there is little we can offer at this time.  Seek the past.  Hold yourself apart from it until you know yourself.  And seek the Ancient.  Our obligations to your mentor are paid."<br><br>"You mentioned earlier that you had a service for me to perform?"<br><br>Again, the smile was faintly menacing.  "You will be contacted if we have need.  Good journeys, Lady Carezzia."<br><br>[As he begins to narrow the search for the endangered younger druid, the Ancient is suddenly struck with the urge to explain theology to Carezzia's pet cat]-- "The problem, as I see it, is that no one understands their own gods and their place in the pantheon."  The cat opened a sleepy eye then closed it again in a slow wink as the druid continued his lecture, apparent undaunted by the fact that his sole listener was asleep.  "All the deities within the pantheon exist either as paragons in opposition or in compliment.  It gets even more complex when you consider that frequently the oppositions are to a compliment or the reverse.  Karana and Tunare are in compliment to one another, the giver of prey and life and the lord of the storms, master of hunts and bringer of death.  But both of these, this complimentary pair, only oppose each other in function, not in ideology.  They are facets of a singular paragon.  Their singular paragon is opposed in ideology by Innoruuk and Cazic, hate and fear, another complimentary paragon.  Even in this, the paragon of Karana-Tunare in compliment with Innoruuk-Cazic is opposed by the paragon of agnosticism and, on a different facet, Veeshan.  Rallos compliments Karana but not Tunare just as Prexus compliments Tunare but not Karana.  The entire system is a huge web of balance by symbolism and extremes.<br><br>"Look at it this way, which is truly the god of the elves, Innoruuk or Tunare?  It's a trick question, they both are.  No matter which race of elf you consider, their believes are defined just as much by the god of opposition as by the god of technical worship.  Let's take wood elves.  They worship Tunare but are defined in opposition by Innoruuk.  But, Tunare is in compliment to both Karana and Prexus just as Innoruuk is in compliment to Cazic and Rallos and they all are defined further by the greater oppositions.  You see?  Each deity  is understood only when one understands its place in the scheme of the greater pantheon.  It's like attempting to define day without discussing, not only night, but the entire concept of darkness, dawning, twilight, and so on.  Which, of course, leads me to Kaolinn.<br><br>"Our dear paladin brother is obsessive in his service to Mithaniel.  On the surface, that would seem to be a good thing but let me tell you, cat, it will end in madness and death if not mitigated by a greater understanding.  For the heavens sake, how much clearer does it need to be, eh?  The Marrs are twins.  I've seen maps with more complex symbolism.  Mithaniel is paragonic for valor but what does that really mean?  Valor is courage and fearlessness in battle.  Now, taken on its own, how different is that from Rallos?  None, until you examine the compliment and opposition.  Mithaniel is in opposition to Cazic while Rallos isn't.  This tells us that Mithaniel is dedicated to overcoming fear whereas Rallos uses fear as a portion of his armory.  The implication is that the fearlessness embodied by Rallos is an external action, an imposition of one man over another, while Mithaniel's fearlessness is directed internally, the overcoming of one's own personal failings and weaknesses.  It starts as a semantic discussion but, when reasoned out, the difference is of considerable significance.  <br><br>"The twinning of Marr makes the distinction of the kind of valor Mithaniel stands for both easier to divine and, at the same time, that much more significant.  Mithaniel's twin is Erollisi, paragonic of love and, just in case we were a little slow on picking up on the significance, female, just as Tunare is in complement to Karana.  I think that the incestuous overtones are significant here as well, not only are they in compliment within the pantheon--they are bother and sister, inseparable portions of a family unit and twins, implying a singular origin with dual resultant focus--they are also in reliant harmony on each other.  Placed in an incestuous context, they are a mated pair, never to be considered separately except as they are actors upon different stages.  And, since the pantheon is paragonic in its basis, the implied social taboo against incest is not applicable since the end goal is to provide a larger context of religious significance.  Since the belief system is derived from emulation of divine behaviors, the negative aspects are a non-issue."<br><br>The druid paused as one of the elfin guardsmen from nearby Kelethin approached.<br><br>"Are you Descourge Darkdestiny?" the guardsman asked timidly.<br><br>"Yes, this one is.  Now, be a good lad and hold on a minute.  My point here, cat, is that Mithaniel does not, actually, stand for valor exclusively.  He represents valor within the context of his sister, Erollisi--valor in the context of love.<br><br>"Now, to understand that, I have to explain love.  Love is not an emotion, that's lust or infatuation.  Love is an act of conscious will, a choice of a system of actions, the decision to act in a loving manner, if you will.  As such, love is objective, not subjective.  It can exist in a detached rational sense even when the subjective emotions underlying the previous choice may falter.  So, combine valor, fearlessness, with love, the conscious committed decision to act in a certain manner and we arrive at a true understanding of the fearlessness which Mithaniel stands for.  More to the point, it is not a fearlessness, but, as we discussed earlier, it is the overcoming of specific internal fears.  Mithaniel, understood in the context of his twin, represents the internal struggle to overcome our baser emotions and to chose to act with love towards all, even the enemy.  This is the fear which must be overcome.  Not a fear of the enemy, but a fear of the vulnerability within ourselves which is required to act with love towards our enemies, especially when these actions must then be violent and brutal.  We may still be forced to slay the enemy but, having come to regard all living things with love, it takes a terrible strength to still do what must be done.  That is the cowardice to be fought.  That, my feline friend, that is truly valor!<br><br>[After a trail of detective work leads him to Carezzia's captors, the Ancient understands his role to play within the oncoming drama and prepares]-- The druid sighed again.  "I'm exhausted, long day."  He reached into the casket and withdrew a glove-shaped tangle of rusted metal and tattered leather.  Scraps of mummified skin and broken links of chain gave the entire gauntlet a look more suited to a battlefield grave than actual use.  Darkdestiny pulled the traces tight around his forearm and Descourge flexed his hand.  The glove bent stiffly with the creak of hide and rasp of metal on metal.<br><br>The druid closed his hand into a fist then snapped his wrist sharply downward.  Twin spines of iron shot forward from the gauntlets backing, each ending in a short length of fine chain and barbed flesh-hooks.  He relaxed his fist and the spines slid smoothly back into hiding.  Frowning in concentration, he tensed the line of muscle just below his thumb, the dew claw, long atrophied in the "civilized" races.  In response, a spur of metal extended behind the thumb, parallel to his wrist.<br><br>"Looks good," he breathed in a voice heavy with resignation.<br><br>"For a martyr,"  Dark observed, "Opalla had a mean sense of design."<br><br>"He wasn't a martyr until after he died.  Before that, he was just one more poor sod trying to do what was right.  It's almost dawn.  I have to put down roots for a while and rest or I'll be worthless."<br><br>Dark nodded.  "I'll be around."<br>

--Now we come to the heart of the matter, the current tale of treachery and woe.  A continuation of the 'To Sift Through Bitter Ashes' arc--those events which follow Animus de Nova, Creo Igneum, and The Lectures to an Empty Hall, the current arc takes place just after the invasion of Befallen and begins only days before Cazic-Thules assault upon Lesser Fey.--<br><br>T'enel absentmindedly brushed his cheek with the smooth silk of his dining gloves.  The sensation was soothing but did little to ease the growing tension in his gut.  Too many plans were too close to fruition for the Teir'Dal Lord to take pleasure from his small indulgences.<br><br>"Take it away," he sighed, gesturing at the silvered dishes heaped with food that covered the table before him.  "Poison it and then throw it into the streets."  He sat with affected disinterest as the menial's cleared the meal, restless but weary, jaded with ennui.  Once the servants had gone, T'enel waited in silence, stroking the flesh of his eye socket, letting the sensation lull him into a temporary distraction.<br><br>"Will there be anything else, your Lordship?"  The speaker was T'veren, his seneschal and one of the few of his house allowed to speak directly to T'enel.<br><br>"I do not think that I like winning," T'enel said by way of answer.<br><br>"Understandable, m'lord.  Once this small matter has been resolved, perhaps a new challenge will arise worthy of your talents.  This is but a lull, nothing to be troubled at.  Might I suggest that you allow yourself to savor these final moments of the game, luxuriate in your victory, m'lord.  It has, after all, been decades in the achieving."<br><br>"Perhaps.  Yes, I suppose you are correct.  You usually are.  How fairs her ladyship?"<br><br>The manservant coughed discretely to cover his distress at the question before answering in carefully measured tones.  "The Lady T'enel is in fine health.  The other lady is…unchanged in her condition."<br><br>T'enel laughed, a harsh barking sound with no real humor.  "Your tact does you credit.  In other words, my wife is her usual shrewish self and taking it out on the servants will our little caged bird not only does not sing, but is slowly dying."<br><br>"An adequate presumption, m'lord."<br><br>"We must keep her alive a bit longer, Veren.  It would hardly do if she were to fade with a family reunion so close to hand."  He permitted himself a predatory grimace.  "Why, to see her daughter in chains would most certainly break her heart.  I can't have her missing that, can I?  After all she has done for me, it is the least I can do."<br><br>"Regarding that, if I may, m'lord."<br><br>"By all means."<br><br>"It has been brought to my attention that delivery of the Mayong's gifts has been delayed."<br><br>T'enel surged to his feet, overturning his chair in the process.  "Unacceptable," he growled.<br><br>T'veren continued speaking as if uninterrupted.  "The menial Dranerius has cited difficulties with the handling of the animals.  I have taken the liberty of having the handler that the Mayong sent with them summoned.  He awaits the pleasure of your audience."<br><br>High Lord T'enel stripped the white silk from his hands and tossed the gloves to the floor.  "By all means, let us go speak with this lowly," he replied, taking the black leather gloves and ebony cane his seneschal passed into his hands.<br><br>***<br><br>The handler was appropriately genuflective, dropping to his knees as the pair entered, pressing his forehead to stone before the Lord's boots.  T'enel was pleased to see the Mayong's menials followed the proper discipline and dress.  The animal handler's face was covered with a crude leather mask and his body swathed in heavy muslin to spare the nobility the blight of actually seeing the lesser exposed flesh.<br><br>"You may rise and speak freely in his Lordship's presence," T'veren lied politically.  In truth, no menial could ever address a lord with freedom and they were very much aware of the fact.<br><br>The menial rose but kept his eyes appropriately downcast.  "I am at his lordships command."<br><br>"What are you called?" T'veren asked.<br><br>"This one has no name.  His lordship may address this one as anything.  It is ours but to serve."<br><br>"Good, good," mumbled T'enel.  "Well trained.  Now, let me surmise a few things.  As a lowly animal keeper, you must find yourself in a difficult position.  Surely, Dranerius has ordered you to report to no one but him."<br><br>"This is true."<br><br>"And yet you are here."<br><br>"I am.  I was summoned.  It is not mine to refuse."<br><br>"Of course.  So, keeper, if I ask questions of you, will you answer me truthfully, even though you have been ordered otherwise?" T'enel asked liltingly.<br><br>"Yes."  The reply was quick and stern and T'veren sucked in his breath at the breach of etiquette.<br><br>T'enel laughed.  "And why would that be?"<br><br>"This one was given orders by the Lord of Mists.  This one was charged with a duty to deliver beasts and tend them until these beasts passed into the possession of Lord T'enel and to continue in this duty if required.  At no point was this one ever truly the menial Dranerius' to command."  The reply was spoken softly in a matter-of-fact tone but an undercurrent of malice was plain.<br><br>T'enel clapped his hands together in appreciation.  "You see, Veren, the Mayong recognizes the significance of this delivery.  I knew I could rely upon his discretion.  He has sent to us, no simple animal keeper, but a diplomat as well.  And were I to wager, this lowly keeper possesses a few other hidden talents as well."  T'enel addressed the keeper directly.  "I am correct in this?"<br><br>"I am but an humble keeper of beasts, m'lord.  However, you are correct that this one was also chosen from among many.  This one is a noble-blooded crossbreed.  This has given me some affinity with the beasts and a talent for the natural healings."<br><br>"And also given the Mayong a useful agent without arousing strife between houses," T'enel concluded.  "Well played.  Well played indeed.  I will require your continued service, at that.  I have certain 'beasts' that are indeed in need of natural healings.  Oh, Veren, this works out very well.  But tell me, keeper, why has my shipment been delays?  The truth, not Dranerius' lies."<br><br>The keeper hesitated before speaking.  "This one would, before speaking, wonder at his own place within the world."<br><br>"I have already said you will take service within this house.  What more do you require?  I do not bargain with servants."<br><br>"Of course, m'lord.  This one asks only a small boon, an accommodation of an old superstition."<br><br>T'enel arched an eyebrow in surprise.  The Mayong had, indeed, sent him a package filled with surprises.  "So, you are not just a keeper of animals but a keeper of the dead as well?  I had thought that order long extinct.  Still, such misguided necromancy would explain your skills in healing."<br><br>"As your lordship says."<br><br>"Very well then.  It's not as if there is any meaning to the old superstitions.  By Innoruuk I swear, I shall not eat of the dead of my family.  Are you satisfied now, keeper?"<br><br>"I am, m'lord."<br><br>"Then tell me why my presents are being withheld."<br><br>"Dranerius has seen fit to give Lord Rileaus use of your menagerie."<br><br>***<br><br>T'enel stormed through the halls of the House, striking columns with his cane in anger as he passed them.  T'veren was forced into a near-run to keep pace.<br><br>"Hit him with everything we have.  I want him dead.  I want his house burned.  I want the land salted.  I want no two stones left on top of each other and I want his head on a pike."<br><br>"Dranerius or Rileaus, m'lord."<br><br>"Yes!  And do it now.  Tonight.  Kill everyone but the girl and bring her directly to me.  You will see to this personally."<br><br>"Of course, m'lord."<br><br>"Wait.  Do not kill them all.  Spare his oldest son.  I will adopt him and prevent any challenge to my acquisition of Rileaus' holdings.  Kill the rest but bring me that one.  I've enough enemies, I'll not give them a martyred house as well.  Is this understood?"<br><br>"Completely, m'lord, and wise."<br><br>"Do this then for me."<br>

Perhaps because the pebble was attuned to her, perhaps because some agency was watching over her, perhaps because, in a world newly devoid of innocence, reasons no longer mattered either--Carezzia found herself in a world of living statues, wandering in the fraction of the second.

"Leave this place. She waits for you outside, for you and for him…her him. Tell her that I am not finished forging the Ancient. She is Destiny; she will understand."<br><br>Carezzia turned in circles, looking for the speaker, looking for answers. Neither were to be found and she made her way from the burning building, out, from a time-frozen Neriak to the dark forests of the hillsides around. "A dream," she whispered to herself. "Like living in a dream…a waking dream." Here and there around her, the sleepers move sluggishly and seem to be slowly wakening. She hurries to the woods.<br><br><br><br>'You gave me hyacinths first a year ago…Yet when we came back, late, from the hyacinth garden, your arms full, your hair wet, I could not speak, and my eyes failed, I was neither living nor dead, and I knew nothing, looking into the heart of light, the silence.'<br><br><br><br>Destiny waits there, Dark and oppressive like a gathering store. Eyes blazing violet hues, robes snapping in a non-existent wind. A dark black panther stalks about her feet, weaving, menacing, complimenting the ominous image then suddenly an over-grown kitten, pressing against its long-absent master, purring. "It's time to go," growled the brewing storm.<br><br><br><br>'A woman drew her long black hair out tight and fiddled whisper music on those strings and bats with baby faces in the violet light whistled and beat their wings…"<br><br><br><br>[Religious scholars have debated at length on the significance of the battle between Tunare and Cazic-Thule for dominion of Lesser Fey. They have debated the underlying cause of the conflict and they have debated how, if Tunare won the encounter as her followers claim, Cazic-Thule was able to claim the forests as his own. <br><br>They have not, predictably, considered the implications of this conflict to the denizens of the land, nor why this region became their chosen battleground. Such trivial concerns are beneath the consideration of liturgical grey-beards. Neither have they considered why, of all the forest's denizens, the brownies remain completely unaffected. <br><br>Completely lost to all concerned was the question of what, if any, actions were taken by Karana. As always, the Stormlord's motives and interests remain unknown and unquestioned.]<br><br><br><br>ooc-Yes, the references and overtones are deliberate and you spend too much time reading old poetry. <br>

The tree was good for hunting: high for the launch, good overhang on the game trail, a solid grip to the bark. The leaves cast deep shadow and prey rarely looked up.<br><br>This one was loud, singing out its presence well in advance of its approach--an easy, lazy hunt--tense, coil, spring…<br><br>The bard twisted at the last moment and the cat's teeth closed on cloth instead of his throat. The animal's weight bowled him forward and claws raked deeply into the muscles of his shoulders. The bard tried to crawl free and the cat's hind paws hammered into the small of his back, driving the breath from him.<br><br>As abruptly as it had come, the attacker was gone and the bard scrambled to his feet. A frantic glance revealed a wood elf wrestling with a black panther as large as she was and the bard chose the second course of valor--he ran.<br><br>Carezzia shoved her cat away and stood. "What are you doing?" she shouted at it in frustration but the cat's only reply was a disdainful gaze before it began to lick the blood from its fur.<br><br>/you know what it's doing…<br>…pretty birds, feline prey, the natural order/<br>/you feel it too…<br>…the hunt, the taste of blood, the culling of the weak/<br>/prey is given…<br>…prey is taken/<br><br>"Shut up! Just leave me alone!" she yelled at the whispering voices in her mind and sank to the grass, cradling her head in her hands. This was not what she had expected from adulthood, not what she wanted from freedom. Her life was spiraling out of control and all she wanted to do was go home, wherever that was.<br><br>/you are home…<br>…you are always home/<br>/you suffer because you deny your nature…<br>…you will suffer until you understand your nature/<br><br>The elf ignored the whispers and laid back on the ground, staring up at the boughs of the fog-shrouded trees of Toxxulia.<br><br>Her mentor and surrogate father, Quildluane, had died. That was surely the beginning of the end for her childhood, although she had not suspected it at the time. His passing had brought her full circle, back to a mystery of absent parents and estranged relatives, back to the confusion and insecurities of an overly-sheltered upbringing, and, physically, back to the quiet forests of Lesser Faydwer. It had been a chance to take control of her life, to settle the past and answer a few nagging personal questions. Nothing had been right since.<br><br>Her visit to Quildluane's house had attracted the attention of the fairy court itself and prompted an audience with Joleena herself--a meeting which yielded no answers and even more mysteries. She had moved on to Kelethin where her inquiries had triggered highly placed agents of the Teir'Dal--agents that had been in place for decades--and had led to her kidnapping.<br><br>It was when she had been smuggled in chains to Freeport that she had begun to experiment with the newfound charms of her body, with mixed results. The internal politics of the Teir'Dal nobility was complex beyond her understanding and other, external, forces seemed to be at work as well.<br><br>Her awkward seductions had delayed her delivery to her intended captor, placing her, instead, in the home of another Teir'Dal noble. It was there, perfumed, pampered, and drugged, that she had attempted a clumsy escape, attempting to avoid a foul ceremony where she was to be either s sexual servant or living sacrifice--she was unsure which, perhaps both.<br><br>Her memories of her escape were confused and indistinct, an after-effect of the drugging, but she knew that she should never have been successful on her own. There had been an attack during her escape, Teir'Dal against Teir'Dal, and the 'servant class' had been largely ignored in the bloody conflict. Even then, she would have been recaptured eventually had it not been for the Fey.<br><br>The Princess Joleena had given Carezzia a token, little more than a pebble really, but Carezzia had taken great pains to keep the gift with her, even through her captivity. She would learn later that, even as she struggled to find her way free of the Teir'Dal, the gods themselves fought in Lesser Faydwer. When Cazic-Thule cursed and blighted the Fey, the stone had shattered, stranding the lost wood elf temporarily outside of time, free to escape while those about her were frozen in the moment.<br><br>That was the first time she had heard the voices, soft whispers urging her to move toward her destiny, telling her when to turn, which stairs to take, the paths to follow until she was at last free of the dark maze that was Neriak, long gone before time sluggishly resumed.<br><br>The Erudian had been waiting for her as if by plan, Carezzia's cat alongside like a living symbol of reassurance. When the Erudian had opened a rift in space, the wood elf had followed meekly--to Toxxulia.<br><br>The Erudian had proven to be the latest in a long string of mysteries. Carezzia's new keeper spoke little and said even less. She had silently nursed the elf through the after-effects of the drug and the physical hurts of her captivity. Beyond that, Carezzia was left to wander the forest alone or with only the cat for company.<br><br>But she was not alone, not with the voices that whispered softly in the back of her mind.<br><br>"Bat wings."<br><br>Carezzia startled out of her revelry and found herself staring up into the Erudian's dispassionate gaze.<br><br>"And fish. Then we talk." The Erudian turned crisply and stalked out of sight, toward the empty building where she slept.<br><br>Carezzia stood and favored the cat with an expansive shrug of her shoulders. "I guess we need bat wings."<br><br>***<br><br>T'Veren pushed the door closed with his heal and crossed the waiting room to sit next to its only other occupant. "News from the Council, High Lord?"<br><br>T'Ere T'Enel shook his head. "They are still pretending to deliberate. Make no mistake, Veren, I have many enemies among the noble houses but the law is clear. For now, their hands are tied."<br><br>"What about the son?"<br><br>"Troublesome that." T'Enel frowned. "I did give specific orders to spare the oldest son for adoption."<br><br>T'Veren remained silent. Rileaus' oldest son had refused to be taken alive and had proven to be a capable as well. In the end, T'Veren had ordered the younger son taken instead and put a crossbow bolt through the eldest.<br><br>"They'll place the surviving boy as my ward and use him to lever Rileaus' properties away from me when he matures. It is an acceptable cost. I've eliminated another house, for a decade at least, and the other houses have their hands tied. They make not like it but he gave me just cause. It's still poor repayment for the loss of the girl."<br><br>T'Veren nodded. "The prophets have found traces of Fey magics but little else. She appears to have completely vanished during the conflict."<br><br>"Why am I not surprised to find the Fey still involved? I suppose an offense against their gods is not easily forgotten."<br><br>"Even if it fails," T'Veren noted.<br><br>"I'll have my due. That's why I summoned you: any change in her condition?"<br><br>"No, m'lord. The priests can't heal her--in that at least Tunare still protects her. It's a slow process but she's dying."<br><br>"Ideas?"<br><br>"We could release her for a time and then recapture her when she's recovered. It's fairly clear that captivity and Neriak themselves are what is sapping her life. We could also try moving her to a different location for a time."<br><br>"Given all the problems with the daughter, I don't think moving her out of the city is wise. I'd rather see her die than lose her completely."<br><br>T'Veren nodded. "Then we're out of options."<br><br>"Maybe. Move her to the warrens. After all, how different is she from an animal. Oh, and have the Keeper added to my retinue where I can keep an eye on him."<br><br>"As you order. By tomorrow?" T'Veren asked, gesturing toward the closed door leading to the council chamber.<br><br>"Tonight. They can't put me off much longer."<br><br>***<br><br>Lady Evengel T'Enel watched the water cascade from the fountain as if it were the most fascinating thing in the universe. Her hand mindlessly caressed the large hound at her side and sporadically she would pass it a small pastry or sugared treat from the tray beside her. She was known to spend hours here in her underground garden, hiding from the burdens of her house and avoiding the cold sorrow of facing a disinterested, preoccupied husband.<br><br>A maid entered and knelt, unseen behind the Lady T'Enel. "The boy has arrived, m'lady."<br><br>"Rileaus' survivor?"<br><br>"Yes, ma'am."<br><br>"Give him a room and assign him a retainer. Leave me."<br><br>"Yes, ma'am."<br><br>"Wait!" snapped Evengel, raising her hand. "How old is he?"<br><br>"Fourteen, I believe, m'lady."<br><br>"Fourteen. My own son would have been sixteen had he lived," Evengel said in a tone barely stronger than a sigh then raising her voice she added, "Bring him to me. I would see this new child of the house."<br><br>

ooc: Some of the more observant may have noticed that Carezzia's cat has grown from a fuzzy golden kitten to a menacing black panther. That is intentional, I have been using the cat as a visual metaphor for Care's internal, personal developement.)<br><br><br>"Batwings," announced Carezzia, dropping them in a heap on the stone floor. "And fish," she concluded, laying a still flopping stringer beside the heap. The Erudian glanced up briefly and returned to assembling what appeared to be a portable spit. It was the only furnishing other than a spartan bedroll which Carezzia had ever seen the Eruidian employ within the barren building. The house was so empty that Carezzia had found she felt less exposed outside in the forest than inside its walls.<br><br>"Who are you?" the Erudian demanded abruptly.<br><br>"Carezzia Maj…"<br><br>"What are you?" came the interruption.<br><br>"I am a druid of Tunare, but…"<br><br>"Then why are you special?"<br><br>Carezzia took an involuntary step backward. "I don't understand what you are after."<br><br>"Roll the fish in the batwings and stack them here by the spit. For some reason, you are important enough to attract the attention of serious powers of both the High Lords of Neriak and the Fey Court. Tell me why."<br><br>"I don't know."<br><br>/don't you?…<br>…the sins of the father befall his children/<br><br>The Erudian fixed her with a piercing stare then turned back to the spit. "Creo Ignium," she whispered and the interior of the small over was alive with flame. "What do ou know of the history of your guild?"<br><br>Carezzia struggled to keep pace with the changing focus of the inquisition. "The Order was founded by Aelric…" Again she was interrupted, this time by a loud snort of derision.<br><br>"Aelric the Absent. Aelric the Selfish and the Proud." The venom in the Erudian's tone was unmistakable and frightening. It held to promise of imminent violence. "Four men! Four men build that house and he wasn't one of them!<br><br>"They were like brothers--Arturo, Azimuth, Kaolinn, and Descourge--all dedicated to the same goal, all united. They are your history. I don't give a tinkers damn for the first three but they've never failed the family and they have never, ever, failed Des when he needed them. Not many people can say that, not even his own family." The Erudian fell suddenly silent, leaving Carezzia struggling to place the outburst in context.<br><br>The Erudian poked at the coals of the fire and, apparently satisfied with what she found, began to place the fish rolls into the spit. "He's not going back to the Order, not again."<br><br>"Who?" asked Carezzia, still a bit lost in the conversation.<br><br>"Almost a month ago, Descourge went into Neriak, partially to save you, partially for his own reasons. When he returns, if he returns, he is mine. I've waited decades, supporting him, helping him to pursue his vision of a better way of life. I've watched them break his heart again and again and still he goes back. No more. He's earned his rest…I've earned his rest. It's time for a real home, for him and for me. It's time for others to help him instead of the other way around. Enough chasing the dream, it's time he came home to his family. Selfish, I know, but…"<br><br>/she is lonely, she misses her partner…<br>…it is her right to ask/<br><br>The Erudian's voice trailed to silence until Carezzia prompted, "What does this have to do with me?"<br><br>"Calculated risk. That Ancient of Days is blessed and cursed to always be exactly where he is most needed when he is most needed. Your paths have crossed too often and now you leave Neriak even as he goes in. Deny it if you wish but I have to trust his instincts on this. That mean trusting you.<br><br>"There is nothing wrong with his vision. The dreams and philosophies that he has championed for so long are reasonable, if naïve. They have not failed not has he failed in them. It is, instead, that the fight for a better way is a permanent one. He may be immortal but he cannot fight alone forever. I cannot wait forever. I also can never ask him to abandon the fight. It is more than his life's work; it is who he is. To ask him to stop would be to betray everything he is and to betray his trust…"<br><br>/she is mistaken, though accurate…<br>…she is his life's work, his greatest achievement/<br><br>"I am asking you to take up his burden, to carry a portion of the load and speak wisdom in his place. You will not be alone. He could no more stop trying than he can stop breathing but he cannot always be first and only any longer. All of the Destined will be here to help but…I don't want him to fight this war alone any longer."<br><br>/tred cautious, she is vulnerable now…<br>…weakness creates aggression/<br><br>"I'm not sure I understand. I don't even know if I can," stammered the wood elf, overwhelmed by the momentum of the moment.<br><br>"Take this." The Erudian passed her a rough, iron-wrought key on a long loop of leather. "It is to his desk in your guild's council room. Read his notes. Consider the matter. There is time yet."<br><br>"I…I will do this."<br><br>/there will be no turning back…<br>…the decision was already made/<br><br>"Good," snapped the Erudian, suddenly brusque again. She turned and began to flip the fish rolls, hissing from the heat, out of the spit and onto the floor in a low mound. As she did, there came a low, insistent scratching at the door. "Let him in before he ruins the woodwork."<br><br>Carezzia opened the door and was nearly knocked from her feet as a stout bundle of fur and energy burst into the room and trundled to the mound of cooling fish rolls. Regaining her balance, she was able to get a clearer look at the new arrival and she began to grin. It was a bear cub and a well-fed one at that. He looked like a barrel with tree stumps for legs all covered in black fur. The bear made a 'whumphling' sound and began to plow through the pile of cooked fish. To Carezzia's surprise, the Erudian knelt and drew the beast into an affectionate embrace and a momentary smile crossed the usually grim face.<br><br>The Erudian stood and faced Carezzia, the smile gone as if it had never existed. "This is Marlowe. He is dumb, weak, and easily distracted. You will treat him with respect and affection for he is a true companion and no simple pet."<br><br>"I do not understand again."<br><br>The Erudian hissed in frustration before speaking. "There is no love lost between the monk Arturo and I but he has always done very well by the Ancient. Frustrated with the persistent, lonely wanderings of his friend, the monk took it upon himself to bring the matter to the attention of the appropriate authorities, shall we say. He fought his way across the Plane of Growth and to Tunare herself to demand a boon. She relented and Arturo insisted that it was not right for the Ancient to be forever alone simply because his duties to the Court demanded that he travel the length and breadth of the world. The result of this was Marlowe--a permanent, bound companion."<br><br>"Then why is he here instead of with Descourge?"<br><br>"Because he is needed here. Do not trouble yourself with matters beyond your station. For now, Marlowe will lead you back to the dustbin you call a guildhall. When you are ready, remember that our ursine friend is especially fond of fish." While the Erudian spoke, the small bear ate the last of the fish and began licking the floor they had lain upon.<br><br>/she does not fully understand either…<br>…there is nothing to understand/<br>/it is a mercy…<br>…it is a mistake mixing hunter and prey/<br>/the two are intrinsically bound, the separation of predator and prey is an illusion…<br>…we are not agreed on this/<br>/it is done…<br>…it is allowed/<br><br>Carezzia was suddenly aware of the Erudian staring at her with a mixture of curiosity and disgust. "You hear them, don't you?"<br><br>"Hear what?"<br><br>"Don't obfuscate. You hear the voices, the susurrus of the wind, the whispering of the trees, call it what you will."<br><br>"I don't know what it is that I hear. I just don't know."<br><br>"Humph. The Ancient hears them as well. It is probably the fey. <br><br>"Marlowe?" the Erudian called to the bear and he turned, his mouth open, tongue lapping the last traces of food from his muzzle. "Take her home."<br><br>The bear gave a contented 'harumph' and a glowing rift appeared before him. With a rolling gait, the bear trotted through and Carezzia hurried behind him.<br><br>***<br><br>For decades, her entire world had been a three foot wide circle of iron, a flat bottomed cage with arching iron bars reaching to a central point, a cold metallic dome. It was almost wide enough to lie down, almost high enough to stand up. Increasingly over the years, her mind would leave her body, flying free to live in memories or hiding in dreams, and she had become used to long periods of lost time. The world outside held only the barest of interests for her.<br><br>This awakening was different--there was light. The Teir'Dal used visible light only rarely, for reading or for workings of extreme detail. Even then, the light was limited, a cluster of candles, an isolated torch or lantern, but nothing like this. Her surroundings were flooded with light, a complete, ambient glow so very different from the shadow-spawning flickers of fire. In truth, the glow was terribly dim but after years trapped in the subterranean blackness of Neriak, it was blinding. She was forced to keep her eyes tightly closed, tears trickling from beneath her lashes.<br><br>While her eyes could not seek, her ears did. The loudest sound was an intermittent scraping, the scratch of metal on stone, but behind it boiled a sea of rustlings, of dragging and walking, breathing, panting, and growling, of life. She heard the click of claws and the hiss of scales, the clack of hooves and the patter of paws. The noises were soft behind the scraping but she heard them and sought more, her mind returning to a long neglected body. She smelled manure and sweat, damp fur and urine, and across it all lay the wonderful perfume of dried hay. Teasing at the edge of her reeling senses, perhaps, barely, she heard a faint humming, the barest lilt of song.<br><br>It was too much. Either she was dead or mad, or, worse yet, her captors had happened upon a new level of creativity and sadism. Light and life--this could not be true…<br><br>It was then that Kathrin Majialenne realized she was no longer in her cage.<br><br>

Kathrin realized the absence of the cage by the pain.  After years spent laying in an unnatural curl, without the cage to bind her, her legs had begun to relax and, as they extended, painful cramps lanced her muscles.  She pulled herself into a tight ball and struggled not to cry out.  Even free, she was still caged.  It could be weeks, even months, before she would be able to lie flat.  As for walking…she refused to consider the dire possibility that the ability might be forever lost.<br><br>To distract herself, she set about learning what she could of her new surroundings, hopefully without betraying her wakefulness to any who might be watching.  The scraping sound seemed closer.<br><br>She pressed a hand downward, shielded from view beneath her body.  She lay on what felt to be a mound of dried cut grasses.  Spears of broken straws poked at her hand as she felt about and found that, only a few inches down, the floor beneath was of cold stone.<br><br>Ignoring her watering eyes and the throbbing of a growing headache, she forced her eyes open to slits and tried to see.  The glowing light was less overwhelming now.  Vision blurred by tears, she made out the rough details of her surroundings.<br><br>Kathrin lay on a crude pallet of straw roughly in the center of a wide but low ceilinged cavern.  Darker alcoves at the cave's edges seemed to serve as stanchions and cells for the menagerie that she could hear but still not see clearly in the glow of the light.  The warm illumination was emitted from paper lanterns which were hung about the uneven cavern walls, filled with fireflies, or, more likely, glowing beetles.<br><br>She was still underground, probably still in Neriak, just deeper.  The realization drained much of the hope she had begun to feel--it was a larger, different type, but a cage nevertheless.<br><br>The scraping noises came again and she twisted cautiously to look toward the source.  At the cavern's darkened edge, a humanoid figure was mucking the alcoves, pitching used straw into a two-wheeled cart, the metal tines of a long fork striking at intervals against the stone of the cavern's floor.  As she watched, her vision gradually adjusting to the light, the figure hefted the twin handles that served as the cart's yoke and dragged it beyond her range of sight.  Minutes later, it returned, the contents of the cart replaced with a bound bundle of straw.  It grunted with effort as it hefted the bale and labored it into the dark stall.  Dropping the bale, the figure struck the bundle with a slashing backhanded motion of its left hand and the bale burst open.  The creature kicked the bale apart then finalized its spreading with the metallic fork.  Though its proportions were humanoid, the creature was stooped and walked with a rolling limp.  Its left hand and lower arm seemed abnormally large, possibly clubbed.<br><br>The creature pulled the cart past Kathrin's pallet and dropped the handles at the entrance of another alcove.  As it passed, she was able to get a closer look at her "companion."  It was draped all about in ill-fitting rags and comically articulated like an animated scarecrow.  For lack of distinguishable characteristics, Kathrin presumed it to be male.  Its face was hidden by a rough leather mask and its eye were covered in a milky film.  Her memory dredged up a half-forgotten tale of orc-Teir'Dal crossbreeds bred as menial slaves for the dark elfin nobility, and she suppressed a shiver.<br><br>Suddenly, the creature straightened to attention, like a dog catching a scent, and it shuffled toward her.  Kathrin pressed her eyes closed and tried to keep her breathing calm and regular, as if she were still asleep.  She heard its heavy treads stop quite near her prone form and it began to speak.<br><br>"I could provide you with a sophoric to assist your sleep and ease your pains, but I am certain you would reject such an offer.  You are in the warrens below the House T'Enel, the place where the High Lord retains his private menagerie.  I am the Keeper of this place.  Upon my return, we shall begin the task of minimizing the damage already done to your corporeal form.  Saffron, feverfew, and nettles will be an adequate start, I believe.  I advise you to rest.  For myself, I am in danger of being late for a dinner date and may not return for many hours."<br><br>As the creature's footsteps faded with distance, she realized belatedly that the words had been spoken, with no trace of slur or accent, in the precise formal tongue of the Feir'Dal.<br><br>***<br><br>T'Veren watched the members of the High Lord's retinue assemble in the dining room with a jaundiced interest, focusing most of his attention on the two most recent additions:  the young "lord" Rileaus and the menial Keeper.<br><br>It was T'Ere's habit to take his evening meals, when possible, with both his family and those he considered chief among his servants; a constant, physical reminder of who their master truly was.<br><br>"Leave a clerk too long unattended and he will begin to believe that the monies he handles are his own," T'Ere had once remarked and T'Veren agreed however, where the High Lord wanted to be seen, his 'right hand' preferred to see.<br><br>The High Lord and his family sat behind the long banquet table that fronted the dining room, facing the perpendicular rows of lower tables where the menials supped.  T'Veren was seated at the Lord's right, a position of trust and honor but, more importantly to T'Veren, a position which afforded him full view of the dining hall's occupants.  While the staff looked up, presumably with gratitude and adoration, T'Veren looked down, measuring their motions and glances, studying them for lapses in control, knowing looks of shared meaning, and hints of disloyalty or conspiracy.  More than once, T'Veren's surveillance had lead to the undoing of a plot against or within the house.<br><br>T'Veren's position within the House T'Enel was at once uniquely secure and unenviable.  T'Veren was T'Ere's cousin on his mother's side, granting him all the privileges of nobility but placing him outside the line of succession.  He would never hold a position higher than T'Ere's second.  To a different man, this would be a source of constant frustration but T'Veren's personality was perfectly matched to the role.  He enjoyed an unusual level of freedom for a member of a noble house, the satisfaction of a job done well, and an increasingly powerful house:  fulfillment enough of his ambitions.  That T'Ere trusted him above all others was his greatest reward and, among the paranoid suspicions and constant plotting of the Teir'Dal nobility, the greatest freedom.  A shared childhood and a few disgraceful incidents carefully hidden insured the bond.<br><br>"What do you think of the boy?" T'Ere asked, leaning close to be heard.<br><br>"Typical:  cowed, weak, petulant, eminently malleable--treat him well, indulge his whim and coddle him a bit and he'll never grow enough of a spine to become a threat.  Be cautious however; no one throws a temper tantrum like a spoiled child."<br><br>"What about loyalty, Veren?  Or at least control?"<br><br>"Hard to say.  We have years before it becomes an issue.  I think the Lady Even'gel may prove to be an asset in that department.  She seems quite taken with the young man and he is going to be desperate for the emotional security of a parental figure not directly related to the death of his family."<br><br>T'Ere snorted.  "In other words, he'll always hate me but I can probably rule him indirectly through my wife.  You're a cold one, Veren, but probably right again.  Even' has taken to doting over the whelp as bad as she does that damned dog."<br><br>T'Veren remained pointedly silent, disguising his discomfort with a mouthful of food.<br><br>T'Ere appeared not to notice.  "What of our ragged little Keeper?"<br><br>T'Veren chewed slowly as he studied the Keeper across the room.  The menial had dressed for the dinner as best he could.  His tattered leather mask had been replaced with a polished metal one and soiled rags exchanged for a more colorful motley of clean ones.  Replaced, too, were the heavy, soiled  bandages covering his left hand, now surprisingly white with new wrappings.  As T'Veren watched, the Keeper ate sparingly:  pulling his food apart into small pieces with his good hand, not always an easy task, and then slipping the bits beneath the mask.<br><br>"I don't trust him," T'Veren replied at length.  "I'd like to know why the Mayong maimed him before sending him to us."<br><br>"His face, you mean?"<br><br>"No, but that as well.  I was referring to his hand.  The way he eats, the foot he leads with as he walks, all of his body language, the way he holds his weight as he stands--every indicator is that he's left handed, now obviously maimed.  And he hums?"<br><br>"He what?"<br><br>"Hums, sings, things like that.  Not loudly or often but enough that I've noticed it."<br><br>T'Enel popped a morsel into his mouth and spoke around it.  "No harm in that.  Innoruuk himself has an orchestra."<br><br>"But the Mayong doesn't.  He hates music, made it illegal in all of Mistmoore."<br><br>"Maybe that's your answer.  On the maiming, I mean."<br><br>"Maybe.  I still don't trust him.  He carries himself wrong for a servant."  <br><br>"How so?"<br><br>"Head up, back straight, shoulders square.  He watches his surroundings instead of his feet.  He's humble enough in public but his body language screams the opposite.  No, that one is no servant."<br><br>"Ah-ha!" interjected T'Enel, thrusting his fork into the air for emphasis.   "There I see a flaw in your reasoning, old friend.  You forget, he is a master of the animals.  He walks like one of our generals, does he not?"<br><br>"My point.  He walks exactly like a general or a priest, not a menial."<br><br>"Ah, Veren, a leader must walk as a leader.  He must show no weakness and he must do so naturally.  It is not something that can be disguised or faked.  He can not move as a servant.  We see this in the leaders of our army; why should we not expect it in the general of our warrens?  He is our animal general."<br><br>"Not exactly the same thing, m'lord."  T'Veren watched as the Keeper pulled a portion of bone free of its meat and inspected it closely.  Apparently dissatisfied, the Keeper set it aside and returned to worrying apart his meal.<br><br>"On this, you borrow worry.  Besides, for so long as he keeps our 'guest' alive, he can walk however he chooses.  Mark my words, cousin:  Man or beast, leadership is a constant."<br><br>***<br><br>Visibility was good through the hilly forest in the spring.  It had been fall when Carezzia had last seen the Order's guildhouse.  The winter had passed during her travels and imprisonment and the brisk chill of the moist early morning was a welcome sensation.<br><br>The building seemed smaller than she remembered it and it did not seem to have weathered well through the winter storms.  The roof seemed to sag and the walls looked as if they leaned inward against each other.  No matter, the familiar surroundings were a welcome sight.<br><br>It was as she descended the last rolling hillside toward the building that the feeling of unease began to settle on her, like a stranger within her own home, a butterfly straining against the shell of its cocoon.  Her breath quickened and she look nervously around.  The bear, Marlowe, had vanished sometime during her descent and her cat had loped off on business of its own, apparently undisturbed.  She struggled to cast off the shadow of claustrophobia and crossed the last of the distance to the house.<br><br>The building was empty, at least from appearances, and had been that way for some time.  Carezzia was used to the vacancy of the guildhouse.  Most of those who lived within spent the majority of their lives on the road, but this was a strangely different emptiness; surreal and dreamlike, a sealed kind of empty, a sort of…<br><br>/sacrosanct…<br>…sepulturic/<br><br>The voices had been silent since she had left Toxxulia and she shivered.<br><br>/do not be afraid…<br>…know fear/<br>/reality is your intent to perceive…<br>…it is only real if you choose it/<br><br>She placed a hand on the door, noticing deep scars in the wood of the frame.  The door sagged on its hinges, swollen in the damp of the morning.  The wood elf had to struggle, almost comically, to force it open.  The brisk chill of the forest deepened into a true cold and even with the morning light spilling in, the building felt dark, permanently tinged with grey.  Despite her concerns, Carezzia pulled the door closed behind her.  It seemed…proper.<br><br>She expected her footsteps to echo in the hallways.  Instead, there was only a muffled shuffling as she moved, which, to her chagrin, grated even worse on her nerves.  She decided to forego a visit to her room and proceed directly to her goal:  the battered desk in the council room.  As she turned away from the passage to the member's quarters, a bright pin-point flash of silver caught her eyes.<br><br>Captivated by the glimmer, Carezzia sprinted to it, searching the blank wall where she had seen it.  Rough cut oaken planking stood mutely before her, its only abnormality a blackened knothole just below shoulder height.  Stymied by the anomaly, she turned again toward the doors of the council chamber. <br><br>Carezzia raised her hand to press open the double doors and paused.  The very room was a mystery, a place long denied her and a place she had never felt comfortable.  It was a pot brewing with tension for brief moments and then drained empty for weeks on end, the raw emotion left behind, hanging in the air, sealed within these doors.<br><br>In her experience, only one man had seemed immune to the room's sanctity.  She thought on what the Erudian had told her of the builders of the house.  Perhaps that was why Descourge had never seemed phased by the atmosphere of the room, because he predated the council, because he had helped to build the room.  More likely, she reasoned, because he knew that this single room would give him the most privacy.<br><br>If the old druid had been one of the builders…Carezzia dug through the few belongings she had recovered, searching for the prints of the guildhouse the fairy had given her.  Finding them, she sat in the hall and unrolled them.  Studying them, she traced the outline of rooms with her fingers, searching for what she would not find.<br><br>Both the Ancient and the Fey had specifically referred to Descourge's room within the guildhouse but, according to the prints and her own explorations, it was flatly impossible for that room to be in the building.  Frustrated and perplexed, she returned the prints to their tube and stood, again facing the double doors.<br><br>There was a deep scar in one of the door panels, a hole as if something had been driven into it.  Whatever had happened, no effort had been made to repair or hide the wound.  She pressed her fingertips against it, feeling the edges of the wood, and found a memory.<br><br>A lifetime ago, she had found Azimuth standing similarly before these doors, wearing a melancholy look with his single eye staring forward into the past at some personal remembrance.  "It is a great irony to me," he had whispered upon her approach, "that the argument took place, not here, but in the Theatre of the Tranquil.  I wonder if he appreciates the melodrama."  Carezzia had been young then, and new to the house.  She had withdrawn quietly, confused and a little frightened.  Now she wished the wizard were here, or at least that she had questioned him further.<br><br>She was stalling.  To her chagrin, she realized she was truly afraid.  Before she could lose her nerve, the elf shoved open the doors.<br><br>

The Lady Even'gel clutched her husband's arm and tried in vain to keep her voice from rising to a whining pitch.  "You've spent two days away before the Council and all of dinner you ignored me."<br><br>T'Enel pulled away with a jerk.  "I had to speak with Veren at dinner.  I've lost two days and the work of running this house does not stop when I am absent.  I have matters to see to."<br><br>"You always have matters to see to.  Let someone else do them.  Why did you even attack House Rileaus?  Am I not enough for you?  You have to always have some intrigue to amuse you."<br><br>"Even'gel, I do not have time for this!"  T'Enel snapped.<br><br>"You never have time for me.  Ever since Garet died…"<br><br>"Never speak that name to me!"<br><br>"He was our son!"<br><br>"He's dead, woman!  Let it go!"<br><br>"How can I?  You avoid me, you haven't touched me for years.  Am I repulsive?  Is that it?  You've found another, more attractive woman to replace me?"<br><br>"You are hysterical!"  the High Lord shouted, shoving back her clinging, reaching hands.  "See to your dog and the boy."<br><br>"Rene."<br><br>"Rene, whatever.  I have a house to run and I could do with some help for a change instead of your incessant crying!"  T'Enel stormed from her room, slamming the door behind him.<br><br>"Maid!"  Even'gel cried out in distress and collapsed, sobbing, to the floor.<br><br>"M'lady, are you…"<br><br>"Bring me a cordial.  I must have a tonic for my nerves," she fluttered, wringing her hands as the girl rushed to her side.  "I shall go to my garden.  Bring me the hound and summon the young Lord Rene to meet me as well."<br><br>***<br><br>T'Enel burst into the study, slamming open the door and startling T'Veren from the ledgers he had been examining.  "I swear that woman will drive me mad.  I indulge her every whim and still she clings to me like a drowning child.  Does she think I've no better use for my time than holding her hand and lisping poetry to her?"<br><br>"She is your wife, T'Enel," replied T'Veren curtly, flustered from his usual composure by the suddenness of the interruption.<br><br>"Do I sense disapproval?  You agree with her?"<br><br>T'Veren recognized the hidden danger of the temper which lurked beneath the question.  The High Lord was in no mood for honest advice.  "I simply state that when you chose her as your bride, you wanted a woman who would be dependant upon you and easy to--well--control.  You wished no concerns regarding her loyalties.  Her overly emotional outbursts are merely a symptom of these more desirable qualities."<br><br>T'Enel hesitated, uncertain if he had been somehow insulted, then shrugged.  "As you say, cousin.  It is a passing bother.  Ha!  She even accused me of having a mistress."<br><br>You do, T'Veren thought; your revenge is your lover now.  Then, aloud, "I fear we face a long night.  These records from Rileaus are going to take some time to review."<br><br>***<br><br>Rene Rileaus, ward of House T'Enel, approached his new mother timidly, disturbed by her obvious distress.<br><br>"You…you've been crying," he said softly.<br><br>She turned a wan smile toward him.  "It is all right, child.  We just…we had a slight argument."<br><br>"Did he strike you?"<br><br>"To my very heart.  He does me such wrong yet I love him so.  I only wish…I do not want him ever to be hurt but, if only he could feel what I feel, if he could know the pain of losing the very thing you love the most as his estrangement does to me."<br><br>Rene nodded, silently thinking of his own family, slain utterly at T'Ere's command.<br><br>Even'gel sighed, the sound catching in her breast like a sob.  "Have the maids bring me another cordial.  Oh my nerves.  I shant sleep again tonight, I'm sure."<br><br>***<br><br>A new smell, a steam of garlic and onions wafting through her darkness, lured Kathrin back to awareness and she moaned painfully as her mind crossed again the threshold back to her body.<br><br>"Drink it slowly," instructed the Keeper, again in precise and formal Feir'Dal. "I've a headache and no desire to clean your regurgitation."  He pressed a warm, earthenware mug into her hands.<br><br>In reply, she threw the container toward the sound of his voice.  She heard the crock shatter and her Keeper hissed in frustration.  "Drink it yourself," she growled.<br><br>"If you do not take sustenance, you will die."<br><br>"Then let me die.  It is my only escape from this torment."<br><br>"For, if you were to escape physically, you would endanger your children.  Better that your knowledges and secrets die with you than T'Ere should ever have a chance to spy upon you unawares.  This, I understand.  The druid Quill said much the same to me before he died."<br><br>Kathrin forced herself into a roughly sitting position and opened her eyes to see the Keeper staring at her appraisingly, head cocked to one side like a bird, gauging her reaction.<br><br>"How do you know of Quildluane?" she demanded.<br><br>"Yes," the creature replied as if hearing a different question.  "I have taken steps to insure that we will not be overheard or spied upon.  The rats themselves stand sentry for us and the arcane wards placed to prevent your possible escape also function quite well to prevent scrying as well.  Thank you for your concern."<br><br>"I said…"<br><br>"I heard what you said!" the Keeper snapped.  "Next you will remind me that Quill was a bard by training and then you will ask me how he died.  None of these questions have merit and I've no desire to banter words with you."<br><br>"Then leave me die in peace!"<br><br>"No.  Your death at this juncture serves no purpose.  To die now is to throw aside your last weapon against your enemy.  Die on your own timetable, not his.  Now drink."<br><br>"I threw it away."<br><br>"And I have a dozen more prepared.  I have dealt with childish wood elves before."<br><br>"Childish?  I'm old enough…"<br><br>"To have grandchildren!  Have you thought about that?  It's bigger than just you!"  The Keeper loomed over Kathrin, his eyes intent and his tone angry.  "Yes, grandchildren.  You've been down here a long time and the stakes are a lot higher.  Now you make up your mind:  risk all of them for the sake of your pride or shut up and drink the blasted broth.  Eat, rest, and then go back to dying if you're so set on it but act like an adult.  Act like the woman Arthur Majialenne married; the woman who gave up everything, even her children, to stop T'Ere the first time!"<br><br>Fear and anger fought for supremacy in Kathrin's mind.  This creature knew more of her family and her past than even T'Ere did.  "Who are you?" she asked.<br><br>The Keeper sighed and the tension drained from his voice.  "I am no one.  I am tired and I am weary.  Just drink the broth."<br><br>"I do not like you," she replied sullenly, accepting the new mug presented to her.<br><br>"Don't need to."<br><br>"But I will trust you…for now."  She lifted the container and drank, small sips on a long empty stomach.<br><br>"Don't trust me.  I have my own goals in this.  We share a common enemy."<br><br>"T'Enel."<br><br>"T'Ere."<br><br>***<br><br>The doors to the council chamber swung open at her touch, silent and smooth, very different from the outer door.  Not much had changed.  The large stone fireplace was empty save for chill ashes and no new timber had been laid within.  The oval table in the room's center, surrounded by chairs, was marred only by a spire of obsidian which curved slightly, one blade-like end driven into the table and the other end sharply snapped off.  The room's final furnishing was the battered roll-top desk in the shadowed corner of the room, occluded by the fireplace, closed and locked.<br><br>Carezzia stepped into the room and a chill danced across the nape of her neck.  She jumped and spun to stare at the empty hallway behind.  Chiding herself for her nervousness, she crossed the threshold into the chamber and pulled the doors closed behind her.  She walked cautiously to the edge of the desk.<br><br>There was a high-backed wooden slat chair at the desk but she chose to stand.  The desk had no drawers, only a shallow tray, recessed a bit below the writing surface.  The roll-top shutter was down, a build-in lock the obvious match to the key she had been given, and the flat of the desk's crest held no trinkets, merely dust.<br><br>She reached to pull out the tray and her fingers brushed cold metal.  She knelt to see a long, curved scabbard was fastened to the underside of the tray with short leather straps and brads--hidden and empty.  Again the incongruity struck her:  here in the guild's most inner sanctum was a place to secret a weapon.<br><br>The tray itself was awash with feathers.  Worn and broken remnants of a half-hundred quills filled the tray to overflowing, drifting, now freed, to the floor about the desk like an avian rainfall.  Smothered beneath their quilt, she noted other bits of debris:  the broken shaft and blade of a pen-knife, an empty ink pot, fragments of bone and leather, scraps of parchment crushed into balls, splintered birch bark, partially chewed.<br><br>She pulled one of the larger balls of parchment free and unfolded it.  Crabbed writing covered both sides in at least three different inks and a dozen different languages.  The scrap was so heavily used that she could barely make out individual words.  Cross-hatched notes added even more chaos to the scribblings.  Shopping lists and cooking recipes, traveling directions and contextless lines of doggerel--all these things and more were woven across each other upon the page.<br><br>Carezzia laid the paper on the council table and then, finding no other way up, climbed onto the table, stretching to reach the lamps hung above it.  After lighting them and a troublesome period of trimming wicks and adjusting shutters, she coaxed the room into a comfortable illumination.  The light brightened her mood as well as her surroundings and she was smiling by the time she hopped back to the floor.  The reflection of light from the black spar in the table captivated her and she watched the twinkling motes of color dance across the obsidian surface.<br><br>/beauty in all things…<br>…easily distracted/<br>/appreciative and artistic…<br>…prey/<br><br>She turned her attention again to the scrap of parchment, now easier to discern in the light and, turning it at an angle, found what seemed to be a discarded list of tasks.  She read the portions she could make out and smiled at the glimpses of the personality behind its author.<br><br>"Rescrap bear pelt.  Amend Charter.  Patch Tunic.  Talk to Tony re-Kane.  Finish trans. on Tesch Mas scrolls.  Eat.  Talk to Millers re-carrots.  Teleport Monk.  Repair porch.  See Misty re-Paw, sick child?  Kill Goonda.  Find missing boot.  Talk to T/K re-alliance CoV/fey.  Establish Senate.  Apologize to Oz, again re-eye.  Find figurehead for empire.  Replace broken lock, get extra key made.  Kill Aelric."<br><br>At the last item she laughed aloud, then again harder when she saw, obviously added later, an arrow moving the item to a significantly higher priority on the list.  She returned the parchment to the tray, crammed the feathers down as best she could, and shoved it hurriedly closed.<br><br>She was tired from the road and the tension of her day but it was still early and she felt more at ease now.  The kindling box by the fireplace was full and a few large sticks of wood were lodged beside it.  It did not take her long to build a respectable fire to ward off the chill and she ate a quick lunch from the stores of her pack.  Fortified and warmed, she decided to lay in a supply of wood for the fire and begin her investigation of the desk in earnest.  After her findings in the tray, it promised to be a most interesting endeavor indeed.<br><br>It was only as she licked sticky berry juice from her fingers that she realized she was guilty of the same disregard for her surroundings that she had previously found so mysterious in her predecessor. <br><br>Predecessor:  where had that word sprung from?  In truth, she knew next to nothing about the elder druid and what she did know raised more questions in turn.<br><br>/mentor…<br>…guide/<br>/prototype…<br>…father/<br><br>"No," she protested aloud.  "My father was Arthur Majialenne.  He died when I was a baby.  The bard Quildluane raised me.  I have no connection to…"  Her voice trailed to silence.  She could not deny a sense of kinship to the Ancient, a feeling of shared perspectives, comparable ideals.  Once again, an uncomfortable confusion began to gnaw its way into her mind.<br><br>"Wood for the fire," she announced purposefully and headed for the outside.  There should still be a plentiful supply in the wood bin alongside the porch and she would only need a few armloads to see her through the afternoon.<br><br>She exited the building into the frosty darkness of night.  The stars were clear in the cloudless sky and the moon was well into its assent.  She was suddenly dizzy and sick to her stomach.  "It's not possible.  It can't…"<br><br>/after-effects…<br>…dilation/<br>/residual magics…<br>…asymmetric lag/<br>/self-correcting time…<br>… linearity is illusory anyhow/<br><br>Carezzia fled back into the guildhouse, slamming doors behind her until she was huddled before the fireplace.<br><br>"Tomorrow," she told herself.  "I'll deal with it all tomorrow."  Eventually she fell into a fitful sleep, the baying of wolves her lullaby. <br>

It was not until her second crock of the thin broth that Kathrin felt the lassitude spreading through her body. The Keeper had made a crude firepit of loose stones alongside her pallet and had built up a modest flame, and it was to this she had at first attributed her growing comfort. As her legs began to numb and her eyes refused to focus, she knew her increasing languor was due to most than warmth and nourishment.<br><br>"You've drugged me," she said, her voice flat. "I trusted you and you drugged me."<br><br>The Keeper prodded the fire with the toe of his boot and commented as if to no one in particular. "I'll have to cut more peat if we're to keep a fire tomorrow. Technically, I introduced an herbal sophoric into the broth; I did not, specifically, drug anyone. Nevertheless, your concerns are misplaced. I shall have to examine you to determine the extent of injury done by your years of tight captivity. This will necessitate the extension and palpitation of those joints and muscles long atrophied. Though necessary, the process will most certainly be quite painful. Ergo, by inducing a seditious agent into your system, I provide, not betrayal, but expedient courtesy." <br><br>"Fancy reasons to justify simple deceit. Why not tell me and avoid the lying?"<br><br>"Lying? You wound me but I forgive you. Had I told you, would you have agreed to this, as you put it, drugging?"<br><br>"No."<br><br>"Of course. And since such a thing must be done, I would then have been forced to contrive some deliberate deception to achieve the same result. Thus, by avoiding the discussion, I have avoided the necessity of misleading you."<br><br>"You lie pretty," muttered Kathrin, and surrendered to sleep.<br><br>***<br><br>There was no rest in Carezzia's sleep. It was as if, in her dreams, she were a ribbon of cloth, blown in a swirling wind, turning about in circles and knotting in upon herself. The greyness of unseeing that she twisted through, like a kite's tail caught in a storm, was overshadowed by the fairy, never seen but felt--intuited, leaving impressions stronger than mere visions.<br><br>These were not the small sprites and flittering sylphs common to the woods; they were not ever the regal gentility of the Princess Joleena. These fey were something older, something darker, veiled glimpses of the greater powers, the ancient fairy blood of before the Sundering, before Teir and Feir'Dal. These shadows of antiquity, of sylvan power long diluted and forgotten, these hauntings in her dreams were the Fairy Court in its glory; the elder spirits who slept, themselves outside of time, whose dreams her own mind barely brushed, the ancient spirits of the land; and they frightened her as she felt herself suffocating, drawn moth-like to the blazing intensity of their dreaming visions.<br><br>A storm broke within the clouding of her mind and she was free, racing away from seductive delusions of fallen glory, flying without form through crystal space. Below her stretched a road which was a river outside of time. The river was the flowing of the years, a road from birth to death of all moments of all things, the path of all existence, the penultimate journey unending. The road which was the river was paved with stone, smooth brown pebbles of the river bed of time; and each stone, a moment, a memory, a prophecy, each stone a step in the journey of creation's existence. This was the power of the ancient fey: to stand at the river's banks and see time, at once still and passing--predestination and free will reconciled as a river, choosing its own way yet always choosing the way set before it.<br><br>As she slept, tossing and turning, whimpering and struggling to surface into wakefulness before she drowned, Carezzia's hand closed upon the fragments of the smooth brown stone given her by the fey--the moment of eternal memory plucked from the river of the street of time, the Fairy Court's gift that she might understand the Ancient of Days--and as she did, her nightmares passed, her breathing calmed, and she slipped into a deep and dreamless slumber.<br><br>***<br><br>In the waning hours after midnight, while most of the House T'Enel slept, others remained awake, lying abed, thoughts drifting between schemes and fantasies.<br><br>Rene felt no grief at the loss of his family. His father was an absent figurehead and, by all accounts, a fool and a sensate. His mother turned a blind eye to her husband's peccadilloes and ruled her household with an iron fist; children and servants alike were merely pawns in her games. His sister had existed solely as glorified chattel, a marriageable commodity to expand his mother's web. As for his older brother, that singular impediment to his own claim upon the inheritance of the household--T'Ere had saved Rene the trouble of killing the bullying braggart himself.<br><br>Even so, Rene held no love for T'Ere. The slight against House Rileaus would have to be avenged for pride's sake and the boy had little doubt that T'Ere, if not already, soon would move to bleed the rival house of the bulk of its power and assets. It was not unlikely that, after a time, T'Ere would arrange for a tragic accident to remove the sole heir and absorb the other house entirely. He had time, he knew; T'Ere would have to be patient. His enemies on the Council of Nobles were too many and too strong for T'Ere to give them an excuse to move openly against him but Rene would have to reckon with him in time.<br><br>Of them all, only the Lady Even'gel had shown him any kindness, an affection he intended to return and encourage. He would need allies within the House T'Enel and the High Lord's wife was a significant one. With the possible exception of T'Veren, she alone might have the power to shield Rene from T'Ere. As for T'Veren, Rene saw only the instrument of Rileaus' destruction. T'Ere had given the orders but T'Veren had carried them out. In Rene's mind, T'Ere was a distant threat but T'Veren was an immediate enemy.<br><br>The young man's thoughts ranged from straight-forward violence to subtle betrayal--but they were the things of hopeful imagination. Only one thing stood apart in his mind as having real potential for the vengeance he sought, an insight presented by Even'gel herself: to take from T'Ere that which he truly loved. But what it was, what specifically would strike the deepest, Rene did not yet know. House, power, family--which of these were not important to T'Ere? Rene would have to learn, and soon; T'Ere would not wait forever before moving against him.<br><br>These things the man-child Rene considered as he drifted into more childish dreams of glorious battle and bloody revenge.<br><br>***<br><br>Muted speech stirred Kathrin from her envenomed stupor. The concoction's effects were still heavy in her system and it was a struggle to remain awake.<br><br>"I do not accept this. There must be alternatives." The Keeper was speaking, his voice low but is tone intense, angry. "You teach me to hope in the face of all odds. You show me miracles in all things. You train me to find options when none can be seen. All this and now you tell me 'No', to fulfill my role and bow to the inevitable? I will not accept it!"<br><br>If a reply was made, she did not hear it and, after a moment, the Keeper spoke again. "I do not challenge your wisdom. I challenge your hypocrisy. You once held accountability as a virtue, has that changed? Is it no longer seemly for a priest to think for himself? To expect the gods to abide by the precepts which they teach?" The Keeper spoke louder now, his voice resentful. <br><br>Kathrin shifted on her pallet and forced an eyelid open, trying to catch a glimpse of the conversants before exhaustion overwhelmed her again. The Keeper stood some distance away from the dying fire, his back to her, facing outward into the darkness of the cavern. His cowl was pulled back and his mask held in his left hand. The only feature she could discern was a cascade of wiry white hair that fell well below the his shoulders. Of the one he spoke with, there was no sign.<br><br>Another pause and the Keeper sighed and looked to shrink back in upon himself in defeat. "It is not given that I should know all things," he said finally. "I must accept the Hunters' Peace on this matter."<br><br>As she succumbed again to blackness, Kathrin imagined that she saw motion in the darkness and the shadowed silhouette of wide-spread antlers. Her last conscious thought was surprise that she had not earlier noticed that the Keeper's boots were, in color, red.<br>

For some, the dawning of the new day brought a new beginning; for others, a long delayed rest.  For the truly weary, it was simply a reference point, one more event in a non-stop chain.  Carezzia was one of these.  She woke tired but restless, no chance of falling back to sleep, and her mind abuzz.  She rubbed the mat of sleep from the corners of her eyes and decided to forego a breakfast.<br><br>The beaten iron key unlocked the desk easily.  The lock was well oiled and the shutter of the roll-top slid open without resistance or complaint.  To the young elf's surprise, in contrast to the chaos of detritus she had found in the tray below, the surface of the desk was clean and organized, as if its contents had been deliberately ordered.  She was eerily reminded of someone setting their affairs in line like the leaving of a last will and testament.<br><br>The writing surface of the desk was a rich, polished golden wood.  The deep left corner had an inkpot nestled in a cutout in the desk's surface.  A clay mug filled with fine white sand rested alongside it.  Sheets of blank parchment waited below.  In a shallow trough beside the inkpot lay a single, well-trimmed quill.  On the opposite side of the desk rested a stack of yellowed parchments, easily eight inches high and certainly several hundred pages, each covered in precise, tiny lettering, front and back.  The writing was small but clear, almost artful, and although the letters were of the elder elfin alphabet, the words themselves were in a language unknown to her.<br><br>/this was unexpected…<br>…not really, it is his native language, after all/<br><br>Carezzia pulled a chair to the desk and carefully lifted the top sheet of the manuscript, studying it intensely.  Some of the words were the same as the elder elfin and many were similar.  With effort, she could glean the intent of the sentences by inference and context.<br><br>She reached across her body to lift the quill and paper then moved the inkpot to the other side of the desk.  Painstakingly, she began the slow task of translating the manuscript from the ancient language of the fairy.<br><br>***<br><br>Kathrin awoke to the metallic scraping sounds of the Keeper mucking stalls.  Using her arms for support, she sat up then pulled a bale of straw close enough to lean against.<br><br>"Fire's out!" she called.  If the Keeper heard her, he gave no outward sign.  A rat scurried to the edge of her pallet, its black eyes glistening wetly.  Patches of fur were gnawed away and she could see fleas crawling freely across its body.  She shivered in revulsion and it scuttled away, deeper into the cavern.<br><br>She folder her withered legs beneath her and tried to avoid looking at them too closely.  She heard footfalls and turned to watch the Keeper approach.  Wordlessly, he stacked the dark blocks of peat and rekindled the fire.  As it began to grow from spark to healthy flame, he rose and stalked away, returning in a moment later, kettle in hand.<br><br>"Running late," he grunted, placing the kettle into the blaze to heat.<br><br>"What's the Hunter's Peace?" Kathrine demanded without preamble.  It was difficult for her to read his face behind the mask but the Keeper did not appear fazed by the question.<br><br>"All things for all things and all things in balance.  It is an inescapable fact that life feeds on death and before you tell me that you eat no meat, let me remind you that plants are equally living as any beast of the field.  You look at the rat and are repulsed.  It is not comely to look upon nor appealing in its manners yet, would you prefer a world without them?  Refuse would pile up, disease would not spread and famine would result, larger beasts and birds would lack in food--no, the rat is not pretty but he is necessary." <br><br>"You defend vermin by saying they need to spread disease?"<br><br>"An imperfect example.  Still, without disease, not only would overpopulation lead to famine, but the weak would remain within the herds, prey ratios would be set askew--many bad things would occur.  In addition, being scavengers themselves, if the disease is too virulent, the rat dies, acting as a kind of natural filter.  The point remains:  even those things which we do not find obviously desirable still fulfill a vital role…even if that role is to die.  Life is fueled by death."<br><br>"Fine, keep the rats."<br><br>"Just because it is not an ecology which you understand or appreciate does not mean it is without its place in nature.  Listen:  once a man comes to accept the value of a thing, it is not long before he comes to respect the thing.  In time, he learns to see, in all things, beauty."<br><br>The kettle let out a short hiss of steam and the Keeper snatched it from the fire with his bandaged hand.  He trudged away and was absent for what seemed an eternity before returning and presenting a mug to Kathrin.<br><br>"Careful, hot.  Where was I?"<br><br>"Extolling the beauty of a rat."<br><br>"You are a disagreeable woman when you choose to be.  Now, sooner or later, a hunter faces a hard choice.  He looks at his prey and he sees all those things we have discussed.  He sees the beauty, the majesty, the sheer glory of life, and what can he do?  He has hungry children at home and he needs the meat.  He has to kill an innocent, wonderful thing because it is necessary to him.  Life is fueled by death.  That, Kathrin, is the Hunter's Peace:  to accept that part of the role of living is the dying."<br><br>"You have children?"<br><br>The Keeper laughed with an uncharacteristic pleasantry.  "Oh yes, a yard full."<br><br>"Yours or adopted?"<br><br>"Yes.  I bought the oldest from a traveling circus."<br><br>"You mock me."<br><br>"Would I lie to you?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"Then answer your own questions," the Keeper snarled, the light tone banished as quickly as it had dawned.<br><br>Another rat scuttled to the edge of the fire's glow.  This one was brown and less afflicted with parasites.  One of its front legs lay broken and twisted against its chest.  It released a short shriek then bounded back the way it had come.<br><br>The Keeper sighed and stood up from beside the fire pit.  "T'Ere is coming."<br><br>Kathrine felt the ground rushing up at her.  The Keeper steadied her before she could collapse but she hardly noticed.  Her stomach clenched into a fist and her heart hammered against her ribs.  She gasped for air like a fish on shore.<br><br>In her mind, she had known she was still a prisoner, even here in the Warrens, but it had been a distant fact, easy to ignore.  The light and proximity of animals had comforted her and the Keeper, though troublesome, was companionable in an odd sort of way.  But now, T'Ere was coming, gloating and oppressive--all the fear and anguish of years within the cage came crashing back in waves of panic and despair.  Hope given and snatched away, T'Ere had won again, hurt her again, torture without end…<br><br>"Stand fast," the Keeper was growling at her, shaking her by the shoulders.  "He can only take what you give him.  Be strong and hope.  His time of reckoning is near to hand.  Remember who you are!"<br><br>As her breathing slowed and she regained composure, he released her and moved quickly to the entrance of the cavern, intercepting T'Ere as he entered.<br><br>"High Lord T'Enel, you favor us with your presence," the Keeper said, his voice subdued, sycophantic.  As he spoke, he was backing away from T'Ere's entry, head bowed respectfully.  Without fanfare, T'Veren entered behind his Lord and leaned against a wall, watching it all in silence.<br><br>"Indeed," T'Ere purred.  "I have heard great reports of your work and certainly my beasts have never fared better in the arena."<br><br>"Sadly, Lord T'Enel, I fear your snow leopard will not be fighting again in the near future.  She is with litter from the larger specimen we obtained from Rileaus' stock, the Stonebrunt male.  I believe this will prove fortuitous.  The mixture of her speed and cunning with his size should yield a strong litter."<br><br>"I will defer to your judgment on this matter.  I'm sure you are correct.  Now, let us see to our prize patient, shall we?"<br><br>"Of course.  I have prepared a pallet and small fire for her.  It seems to improve her condition."<br><br>Kathrin drew a deep breath and held it for several seconds before releasing it as a long, soft sigh.  Something in the Keeper's admonitions rang true, steadying her.  She fixed T'Ere with an icy glare and tried to look more confident and defiant than she felt.<br><br>"Oh my," T'Ere chuckled in a pleased tone.  "You've done quite well, Keeper.  She's awake.  I've not seen my dear Kathrin so clear-eyed in years.  Have you missed me, my sweet?"<br><br>Kathrin did not trust her voice and glared her reply.<br><br>"I'm sure we'll have a chance to catch up later.  As for your Keeper, I am most impressed and he should be rewarded.  Tell me, sirrah, what boon would you ask of your lord?"<br><br>The Keeper bowed his head even deeper into his chest.  "I lack for nothing.  I ask only what you have already sworn:  that you will honor the Oaths of the Dead."<br><br>"Haha, of course,  by Innoruuk I swear.  I must say:  I find your primitive superstitions most charming.  Now, how is our patient, truly?  Already, you work miracles but the complete picture can not be so rosy.  I have already been advised that she is rather beyond repair."<br><br>"Sadly true.  I can, at best, delay the inevitable.  The cramped confines of her cage combined with muscular atrophy and malnutrition have wrought horrific damage to the very core of her structure.  Elfin bones are avian in structure.  They are hollow and excessively cartilaginous.  In the case of this elf, the bones of her lower limbs have bowed and twisted into a new configuration which, short of breaking and reforming the bones, cannot be corrected.  Given the overall poor health of the subject, I don't believe such an action would be viable.  The stress and shock to the system would probably kill her.  In addition, this same deformation is evident to a lesser extent in the rest of her body.  The spine is bowed, the ribcage has compacted, and the clavicle curves inward.  Only the arms and skull remain unaffected.  The degeneracy of the skeleton and skeletal muscle is, as far as I can tell externally, indicative of the state of her internal systems as well.  Her humours are severely out of balance, especially the sanguine.  The cardinal humours originate within the bones and the bones are fatally flawed."<br><br>T'Ere nodded as though he understood.  "And so?"<br><br>"She is dying, sooner rather than later.  Camphors and the liberal application of directed heat can aid the blood.  Sophorics can dull the pain.  With birch teas and alcohols, I can thin the blood and diffuse the contentious and melancholy humours."  The Keeper spread his hands as if to show them empty.  "I can delay the inevitable fatal clot but she will die.  She is deceptively fragile.  Harsh treatment, especially to the lower extremities, or even a short fall runs the very real immediate risk of broken bones which, at this juncture, would equally fatal."<br><br>"How long can you keep her alive and awake?"<br><br>"If you put her back in a cage in the dark, as little as a month."<br><br>"And if I leave her here, under your care?"<br><br>"I would not deceive you on this--it is an imprecise study, I can make no guarantees.  Six months to a year, perhaps even longer, I cannot say."<br><br>T'Ere turned his gaze back to Kathrin.  "Then I suppose I shall have to leave you here and visit often.  It's good to see you awake again, pet.  I'd hate for you to miss even a moment of my revenge."  He returned his attention to the Keeper.  "You've done well and shall continue.  You will join me for dinner, of course."<br><br>"Of course."<br><br>"I shall have appropriate dress brought to you.  Come, T'Veren, my visit here is concluded."<br><br>With a final, sweeping gaze, T'Veren followed his Lord as the two exited the cavern.  The Keeper stood immobile for long minutes, waiting, before slowly pulling himself fully upright, uncoiling from the servile bow and releasing an angry hiss from between his teeth.<br><br>"What are the Oaths of the Dead?" Kathrin asked, unable to stand the stillness.<br><br>"In the early days after the Sundering, cannibalism, especially the consumption of those recently deceased from natural causes, was common among the Teir'Dal.  Frequently, Lords would foreswear the act, often at the request of their retainers; presumably because those same retainer would be the first meals in difficult times.  There are remnants that hold to the practice of the oath-giving to this day."<br><br>"And you are one of them."<br><br>"Me?  If it's already dead, seems a waste not to use it.  But I have made it important to T'Ere."  The Keepers voice was heavy with cynical amusement.  "I've work to do now.  My day is cut short by T'Ere's whims again."<br><br>"I won't ever walk again, will I?" blurted Kathrin before he could move away.<br><br>"No.  I'm sorry, but no."<br><br>"And, what you told T'Ere, about my health, about my dying…"<br><br>"Every word the truth," the Keeper replied gently.<br><br>"The Hunter's Peace on this, then," she said at last.  The Keeper turned without answering and walked deeper into the cavern.<br><br>***<br><br>"Any quest for truth must begin with assumptions.  These assumptions are of an intuitive nature and any arguments for their validity are, by definition, circular.  First and foremost, one must assume and accept the existence of a rational universe.  Lacking a base assumption of reason, we would be left without tools to analyze the world around us, both physically and metaphysically.  The second assumption is that the tools of reason are sufficient to discern truth.  It is intuitively obvious that some truths may be determined by reason, at least on a functional level.  Lacking alternatives, we must proceed on the acceptance of reason as our instrument of discernment.<br><br>"Following this, the weapons of our war chest are words.  Words mean things and we must use and accept them as the tools they are.  Most importantly, the understanding of a thing begins with the understanding of its origins and/or its definitions.  I am, at this point, not yet convinced that origins and definitions are not, in the larger sense, the same thing.  For the sake of clarity, I refer to them separately."<br><br>Carezzia laid the quill aside and rubbed the bridge of her nose, heedless of the ink on her fingers.  She had spent the better part of two days struggling to grasp the general contents of the fairy manuscript.  She had returned to the beginning to attempt a true translation of the text and had spent the better part of the morning fighting through the pedantic lecture.  Already, she was exhausted and had barely scratched the surface of the text.<br><br>The work appeared to be a mixture of an autobiographical journal and a philosophical treatise.  The overweening theme was the permanent quest for truth, presented with rhetorical deductions, personal observations, and even examples of personal failures brought forth to illustrate key points.  It was a quest for truth, and a better way of life.  The most surprising thing to Carezzia was that the work was not about truth but the mindset and tools for the quest.<br><br>Carezzia sighed.  "But I can't translate it," she said aloud.  "Not all at once and not without help."  She had started out on a quest of her own, trying to understand her own place in the world.  She had been sidetracked, dead-ended.  Now her search to learn more of the Ancient of Days had become mired in its own set of problems and distractions.  Perhaps that was why the elder druid had written more of how to search rather than what he had found.  Perhaps the search was all there was.<br><br>Definitions and origins--that was what she needed to know, what she had set out to learn about herself.  She had gained tools along her travels--contacts she would not otherwise have met, concepts she would never have learned otherwise--and, in hindsight, she realized that she had not been ready to face what her quest would unearth.  It was time to return to her original quest:  to find herself.<br><br>But where to begin?  Quildluane was dead and her surviving family was too far removed to be of assistance.  Everyone who had known her parents or her caretaker were long dead, buried in the mists of history and their secrets gone with them.  Quildluane had kept no ties with the outside world while raising her.  There was no one…<br><br>No, she corrected herself, that was not true.  Definitions and origins--she smiled at the irony.  Her search had come full circle, mentally and physically.  There was one person who had known of both herself and of Quildluane.  It was time to return to Lesser Feydark and the fairy.<br><br>***<br><br>T'Veren was impressed with the improvements made to the Keeper's appearance.  The motley of rags had been replaced, or covered, by a simple black robe of a cut similar to that worn by the Prophets.  The sleeves were long, draping to points and hiding the Keeper's maimed hand.  The cowl of the robe was seamed, giving it a small peak at the back, hiding the Keeper's face without appearing dilapidated.  A new mask of polished mithral gleamed beneath the hood, the space around the mouth and chin notched out to reveal a scraggly beard.  The dark color of the robe made the menial less obtrusive and he seemed content to eat quietly, alone in a corner, occasionally standing to intercept the servers as they entered or left the room when he had a need.<br><br>Freed from concern over the Keeper, T'Veren devoted much of his attention to the front table itself.  The addition of the Rileaus child had, in T'Veren's opinion, heightened the tension between T'Ere and Even'gel.  For almost as long as they had been together, Even'gel's overly dramatic demands for her husband's attention was balanced against T'Ere's propensity for working and plotting obsessively.  The death of their first and only child early in their marriage had galvanized the emotional tug-of-war into a permanent state.  T'Ere would obsess on some project to the exclusion of all else.  Even' would cry and act hysterically until T'Ere's temper caused him to explode at her.  They would fight, viciously, T'Veren suspected physically at times.  T'Ere would spend the next few weeks indulging his wife's every compulsive whim as they made peace with each other, then the entire cycle would begin again.  Far from optimal; but stable and predictable and thus, to T'Veren, acceptable.<br><br>Rene had changed the dynamic.  Even'gel had always cried to her maids, but they were servants and, therefore, insufficient as an audience for her travails.  This, of course, brought her back to T'Ere, where she would continue her performances until his patience was exhausted and the shouting began.  With Rene, she had found an acceptable and 'safe' audience.  By all reports, the boy was receptive and encouraging to her, but the child's hatred of T'Ere was readily apparent to T'Veren.  Unaware and unconcerned, T'Ere ignored it all as Even'gel's cycle of passive aggression bypassed its normal release point, and began to build into a resentment which, T'Veren feared, would be truly dangerous if not addressed--and soon.<br><br>T'Ere, as usual, believed his cousin's concerns unfounded and overly pessimistic.  The boy was a welcome distraction for Even'; so long as she left him undisturbed, T'Ere saw no reason for worry, much less discussion or action.  T'Veren had already begun to consider having the boy killed but the situation with the other houses was too volatile for such an overt approach.  <br><br>T'Veren's musings were interrupted by a harsh hacking; a dog choking on a bone, not unusual in the large dining hall until Even'gel's shrieks of dismay indicated that the beast in question was not a dog but The Dog.  As the hacking cough shifted to a choking gurgle, the shrieks escalated into screams and the hall's occupants shifted and pressed forward, trying to see.  T'Veren moved to stand behind T'Ere's shoulder, watching the hound and guarding T'Ere's back.  He hoped the spoiled pet would simply die and be done with it.<br><br>The Keeper shoved through the milling onlookers, heedless of rank or propriety.  He balled the long sleeve of his robe around his already bandaged hand and thrust it into the creature's maw, forcing its jaws apart, then shoved it down onto its side, convulsing and choking.  He forced his other hand into the dog's throat then wrenched it out in a shower of saliva and blood.  The dog's struggles were growing weaker and a torrent of watery, pink liquid ran from its mouth and nose.<br><br>"A wire!  I need wire!  Thin metal!"  the Keeper demanded and, without hesitation, Even'gel pulled free the long pin holding her hair and passed it to him.  The menial placed a boot heel on it and twisted it upward with his free hand, forming a crude hook.  Within seconds, he was again deep in the dog's throat.  Giving a grunt and jerk, he tore something free within the hound and a wave of bloody mucous vomited out of the dog's jaws and it began to breathe again, a rasping wet sound.  It lay on its side, glassy-eyed and panting shallowly, a thin pink stream of blood and mucous seeping from its nostrils.<br><br>"We'll have to be extra careful with him.  The throat is torn badly but the crisis is past," the Keeper said to no one in particular, then lifted a bloody hand to inspect the bone he had extracted from the dog's gullet.<br><br>Even'gel threw her arms around the hound and began to sob in relief.  T'Ere moved to comfort her but Rene reached her first, almost but not quite shouldering the High Lord aside.  T'Ere seemed not to notice and turned instead to speak to the Keeper; but T'Veren saw more in Rene's actions than simple concern.  He pressed his lips tightly together and nodded to himself.  The boy would have to be dealt with.<br><br>

The Lady Even'gel hovered over the Keeper as he gingerly inspected her pet.  If it was considered inappropriate for a menial to be alone with the lady of the house in her bedchambers, none had voiced their concerns and the visits continued daily after the dog's injuries.  In truth, there was nothing to be concerned for; the Lady Even'gel's attentions were devoted solely to her hound and the Keeper seemed to prefer the warrens to the softer comforts and finery of the main household.<br><br>The Keeper patted the beast's broad head and stood slowly.  "He'll be fine.  Every day is better and soon you can put him back on solid food.  His diet is a bigger danger to him than anything else right now."<br><br>"Oh, I have to give him his treats," tittered Even'gel, and the Keeper nodded.<br><br>"Of course.  Lady, I must take my leave now.  I've much work awaiting me below."<br><br>"Wait!"  Even'gel wrung her hands in indecision then motioned for the Keeper to sit.  "I…can I count on your discretion?"<br><br>"Certainly.  What troubles you?  Is another of your beasts ill?"<br><br>"No, nothing like that.  You must understand, I can't go to the priests and my own healers are unable to help me.  You have shown…that is, I had thought that perhaps…"<br><br>"Tell me what is wrong."<br><br>"It is my nerves.  I am so distressed.  I cannot rest.  I fear to go out.  I need…if only there were something to make me relax.  Not sleepy, you understand, just--more relaxed, more confident."<br><br>The Keeper hesitated and scratched at his beard before replying.  "I could prepare a tonic, but there would be risks, side-effects…"  His voice trailed to silence as he thought.<br><br>"Just do it!  Please!"  Even'gel clutched at the sleeve of his robe like a drowning woman to her last hope.<br><br>The Keeper stood and pulled away gently.  "Of course.  You'll have it by day's end."<br><br>***<br><br>Carezzia never made it to Lesser Feydark, not directly.  She had barely stepped from the Council chamber when she saw the flash of light in the hall again.  This time she went directly to the knothole, tracing its outline with her finger.  She came away with a sprinkling of sparkling dust and smiled as understanding dawned.  She had wondered how the fairy had been able to travel so quickly and frequently to the guildhouse.  Factoring in her knowledge of the original builders and the mystery of a missing room, she arrived at a new theory:  obviously, she was looking at a permanent gate within the hole.  But how to use it?  The small fey had no problem simply entering the opening but it made no sense that Descourge would not have some way to use it personally as well.<br><br>She placed her palm against the rough wooden planking, enjoying the texture as she thought.  Of all the druids she had ever met, Descourge placed the most emphasis on the alternate physical forms, not for their powers, like the vision of the wolf or the natural defensiveness of the tree, but for the intrinsic value of understanding which the form itself brought to the mind.  Oh a hunch, she let the change overtake her, the first change a druid is given and the most fundamental of them all:  the change into a tree.  As she become wood, she felt herself pulled through the knothole, merging with the fabric of the gate.<br><br>She found herself standing in a heavy forest, shrouded in rolling mists.  She thought of Lesser Feydark but the trees were larger, old growth sycamore and evergreens, a heavy carpet of moss and ferns growing below them.  There was a feeling of unnatural stillness, no bird or animal sounds, only the distant trickle of water sounded in a forest of grey.  The light filtering through the canopy was soft and diffuse, like moonlight.  Lacking a point of reference, she made her way toward the sounds of running water.<br><br>Walking upon a tapestry of needles and moss, Carezzia came to a small clearing.  A pool with low walls formed of stacked and mortared stones was central to it, filling most of the opening.  A smooth arch of water fountained into the air above the pool, falling back, limned in the silver glow of an unseen moon, to ripple across the pool's surface.  She settled upon the lip of the pool, the edge being the height of a low bench, and watched her reflection waving back at her.<br><br>She heard a rustle of cloth by her side and glanced to see the Princess Joleena join her at the pool.  In the context, the arrival was not surprising and neither was it unusual that the fairy appeared taller, almost the same height as the wood elf.<br><br>"I'm glad you made it," said Joleena, her voice a tender whisper above the falling water.<br><br>"Me too.  But where is here?"  Carezzia replied in the same hushed tone.<br><br>"Why, this is Dessy's room, of course.  Not quite Feydark, not quite the old worlds of the true fey, just a little spot in between--it is the place you go through when you pass between the worlds."  The fairy chuckled to herself humorlessly.  "Caught in between, that's my boy."<br><br>"So it is all related then, isn't it?  Me, Descourge, the fey, the Teir'Dal--it all ties together."<br><br>"Of course, dear.  After this many intersections, how can you even doubt?"<br><br>"I just have trouble grasping it all.  I can not see a connection, only coincidence."<br><br>"The link is buried in the past.  The advantage to immortality is time to wait for justice.  The disadvantage is that the demands of honor do not fade with time."<br><br>"But not everyone involved is immortal.  I'm not.  Des isn't."<br><br>Joleena stared hard at Carezzia before replying.  "Are you sure that he isn't?"<br><br>"He was born after the Sundering."<br><br>"Actually, he was never born…but I see this is confusing to you.  Begin at the beginning, so to speak.  What would you know from me, pet?"<br><br>Carezzia startled.  "You just called me pet.  Quildluane called me pet.  So does Descourge.  Why?"<br><br>The fairy princess smiled and trolled her fingertips in the water.  "Your father, he called both his daughters that.  Serrapoth picked up the habit and I suppose he passed it on to the rest of us."<br><br>"Wait, wait.  How did you know my father?  Who is Serrapoth?  And did you say daughters?  Plural?"<br><br>Joleena patted Carezzia's hand with her own.  "I'm going too fast.  Let us take a different tack, shall we?  I take it that you were unable to speak with my Dessy.  Do you still retain the stone I gave you in case he refused to speak with you?"<br><br>"I did.  Even after I was captured by the Teir'Dal, I kept it but something happened.  While I was captive, it shattered and things became strange.  It was like time had stopped for everyone around me and I started hearing voices in my head.  I escaped, but then there were nightmares about ancient things and streets that were rivers and…"<br><br>"Slowly," the fairy interrupted.  "Tell me exactly what happened and don't rush.  Here, we have all the time we need."<br><br>Carezzia complied, explaining what she remembered and reconstructing as best she could the things she did not.  The fairy noble was silent, attentive and encouraging, often seeming to understand what Carezzia was saying before she said it.  Only once did she interrupt.<br><br>"The voices you hear are not the fairy," Joleena interjected.  "Descourge has always heard them, as did Serrapoth before him and, I believe, does his eldest child Aluleeana."  No further explanation had been forthcoming.<br><br>Carezzia concluded with describing how she had found the knothole.  "But I was wrong.  The gateway doesn't lead to Feydark."<br><br>"It does.  As I said, this is an in-between place.  Those who pass through simply will themselves the rest of the way into Feydark.  Most times, this little pocket is empty.  <br><br>"Now, regarding the stone, much of what you've sensed and dreamt is true.  The gods and greater fey stand apart from time, viewing it as a totality in progress.  A portion of that power has remained among the Fairy Court.  What I gave to you in the form of the stone was a memory, a record of a moment from Dessy's own past which I thought would make him more pliable.  When Cazic-Thule invaded Feydark, the fairy were forced to step outside of time to survive.  With the fairy gone from the world, the metaphysics which bound the stone ceased, setting you, too, outside the flow of time.<br><br>"Obviously, the Ancient knew, if not what was happening, at least that something would happen.  That would be why the Erudian was waiting for you.  That is one of his gifts, you see.  He is where he is most needed when he is most needed and he tends to have that effect on other people around him as well.  It also means that he personally was occupied with tasks elsewhere or he would have met you himself.  It seems that the powers of divine providence and interference are hard at work around us.<br><br>"You said that after the stone shattered, you kept the shards.  Later, you had periods of lost time which the voices said were a kind of slippage and you had the nightmares of the elders beyond time.  Then it all stopped.  Do I have that correct?  There have been no further anomalies after the nightmares ceased?"<br><br>"It has only been a few days," Carezzia replied.  "But yes."<br><br>Joleena nodded.  "Then most likely, the shards attuned you to fairy sensibilities and the time issue has been resolved…Let me see your hands."<br><br>Carezzia dutifully offered them, palms up.<br><br>"Ah, there."  Joleena pointed to a trio of faint brown marks on the heal of Carezzia's right hand.  Below the surface, as though the skin had healed over them, she could just make out three slivers, the shape and color of apple seeds.  "It would seem," Joleena noted, "that you carry a bit of the old fairy within you now."<br><br>"Is that bad?  I mean, is it dangerous?"<br><br>"Not in this family.  No more than anything else we have to deal with."<br><br>"This family?"<br><br>The fairy princess shrugged.  "The definition is more functional than literal, but there is no point in denying it.  You are ideologically one of Dessy's brood, just like the rest.  Lucky me," she added cynically, "a grandmother again.  But in all fairness, the fairy have owed a debt of honor to your family for a long time now."<br><br>"Wait:  how can Descourge be your son?  He's half-elfin."<br><br>"Ah, but what is the other half?  Indeed, what is either half really?  Officially, he is adopted but I assure you, fairy blood runs in his veins and the veins of his children.  In many ways, he is more closely related to the elders than to me.  I get ahead of myself again.  I had a purpose for asking about the stone, you see.  The pool here is the Ancient's scrying pool; the water is a parallel flow to the river of time.  With the stone now part of you, there is no reason that you cannot scry into the past here just as he does.<br><br>"But," the fairy held up a warning finger," when to begin?  What to tell and what to show?  Do you know of the Teir'Dal noble T'Ere T'Enel?"<br><br>"I have heard the name.  He is the one who had me captured."<br><br>Joleena nodded.  "A bitter one, he.  And ambitious beyond his station.  When T'Ere was young and newly come into power over his house, he set his mind to a scheme of great magnitude and terrible destruction, a plan so terrible that it was an affront unto the gods themselves, even his own.  I will not speak of his goal further, only of his actions.<br><br>"He began with the kidnapping of Feir'Dal, but only the young and female, and he invested considerable energies and sums to provide for this.  He also became indebted to the Mayong for his assistance.  Even then, your father fought against him, more specifically against his agents, for Arthur did not know of the mind behind the evil nor of its full intent.  <br><br>"Then, with the assistance of the Mayong, T'Ere entered into a alliance with the brownies of Lesser Feydark and the harvesting of the fairies began.  Unlike the taking of the Feir'Dal, the fairy were taken with no regard for gender, age, or station.  Their existence was enough.<br><br>"In those days,  Serrapoth was the High Priest of the Fairy Court.  His successor, Descourge, was not yet born, though he is old enough in body to have been.  Serrapoth discerned that these events were of a singular origin and went to your father and the paladins of Tunare who served alongside him.  They entered into an honorable covenant to war against this evil and it was then that the obligation of the fey to your household began.<br><br>"Safe within Neriak, it was not possible to strike directly against T'Ere but they took captives of their own and learned much of what was transpiring.  T'Ere was horribly overextended, his resources strained, his debt to Mistmoore growing, and the other Teir'Dal noble houses were threatening to overwhelm and consume his weakened house.  The stakes were high and delicately balanced.  T'Ere was near success, a success that would place unrivaled power within his hands, but he was also threatened on all sides and fast running out of time.<br><br>"Therefore, Arthur and Serrapoth contrived a drastic action.  The paladins of Tunare and the warriors of the fairy would strike, simultaneously, at a dozen targets, destroying T'Ere's operations in all of Feydwer.  Arthur himself would lead an attack deep into Mistmoore itself to destroy T'Ere's forces there.  It would be a great loss and one from which T'Ere could recover.<br><br>"In this, they were successful, and it is a tribute to T'Ere's skill and resourcefulness that House T'Enel survived and has again risen to power in Neriak.  That was the beginning and, for some, the end.  Your father died in the effort.  I am sorry for that.  He was a good and noble man and he would have considered his own death a good exchange for their success against T'Enel."<br><br>The two women sat in silence, staring at the water, each lost within their own thoughts.  Eventually, Joleena spoke again.  "Arthur's oldest daughter was betrothed to Arthur's aide, a human and a noble man in his own right.  Shortly after Arthur's death, they were wed and moved to Freeport.  The human became one of the hallowed Sentries of Passion.  They bore a son and, though she tried, your sister, isolated in the human lands, faded."<br><br>Carezzia released a breath she had not realized she was holding.  "She was Kaolinn's mother.  My sister…"<br><br>"Is long dead and safe from T'Ere," the fairy snapped irritably.  "Age and distance kept here from T'Ere's notice.  Her husband's rank protected her from any revenge.<br><br>"Arthur's wife and other child were not so fortunate.  We failed them.  You, we were able to hide for a while but your mother…As I have said, the obligations of honor do not fade with time."  The bitterness in Joleena's voice was pronounced.<br><br>"What happened?"  Carezzia asked tentatively.<br><br>The fairy sighed and gestured across the waters of the pool.  "When you are ready, put forth your hand and see for yourself."<br><br>***<br><br>"Although I hope that my children would disagree, I have been, in my life, a very poor father.  I could make excuses and certainly there are reasons but they are only reasons and do not change the facts.  For all practical purposes, I abandoned my children to grow, in many ways, as orphaned as I was.<br><br>"Most elfs worship Tunare because it is natural and easy.  They live safe and secure on the island where they fled, guarded by dwarf and gnome, in the bosom of the forest where even the greatest evil they face, the Mayong, is still rooted in the fey.  It is eminently predictable that they would be predisposed to the gentler, female side of the pantheon.<br><br>"Half a world away, in Surefall where they send away their half-bred mistakes, such tenderness is not a luxury.  There are those who argue that I misperceive the intent of placing the elfin orphanage in Surefall.  To them I ask:  what other purpose is served by placing these potential marks upon their honor in such a remote location?  It is not that they are sent to the mainland to be reared near the human heritage.  They are sent the width of the continent away.  These children could not be sent further from Feydwer without placing them in the hands of the Erudian government.  The half-elfin children are reared closer to the Kerrans than to other elves.  Only the Iskar  are further removed from these children than the elves themselves.  Increasingly, I become incensed at this callous treatment and, as I have grown older, I have become much more vocal on the plight of the orphan.  Ironic, in light of my own parenting skills.<br><br>"Orphaned and isolated (any druidic training beyond the most basic is unavailable upon the western coast), the harsh and intuitive way of Karana, the unkempt path of the hunter, is the only option for survival.  All things in balance, I suppose, and I would not have chosen an alternative path even had I been given a choice, but my children are a different issue.  Raised as virtual orphans on the plains of Karana with no mother and an absent father, the steady string of fairy messengers I sent to watch over their physical safety were a more consistent influence on their early lives than I was.  (Our 'very quiet ghosts' we called them--these loyal fairy who carried messages and information between us during my travels and I am forever indebted to them and to my own adoptive mother who encouraged them.)<br><br>"If I gave them anything, it was a definition, a thing to stand for.  To be a member of a family is not simply to share a bloodline but to share a commitment, a loyalty, to adopt a common core ideology and a unified face to the world.  If anything, I gave them the ability to ask themselves, in the face of crisis, 'Is this what we stand for' rather than 'Is this what I want.'  To have a 'we' and to belong to something bigger than yourself is very important to the soul and to the development of a noble character.<br><br>"In the wake of such irresponsibility on my part, their decisions later in life come as no surprise to me.  The rebellious attitude of the twins (though I think becoming a bard was a bit excessive), Aluleeana's string of failed relationships with men, even Lulee's timid nature (oh my dear Lulee, perhaps not technically my youngest but always my baby, she keeps a home for us all.  Alu is too much like her father and too filled with the wanderlust)--in all of these I see the results of my own failures as a parent.  Let others look upon my own admissions and learn rather than repeat my own mistakes.<br><br>"Yet, to return to my point, in the midst of such upheaval, when life all around them was a constant struggle for survival, these orphans of mine found a better way.  They chose the gentle paths of Tunare from among the hardships of Karana and grew up to be both strong and kind.  At once, they make me ashamed and terribly proud."<br><br>--The Fairy Manuscripts, as translated by Carezzia--<br><br>***<br><br>Rene suspected he was followed from the time he left the Blind Fish.  It had not taken him long to confirm his suspicions and put the number of pursuers at six.  Their patient stalking warned him that these were professionals rather than merely opportunistic thieves.  Returned to the noble plazas of the Third Gate, he made a dangerous error:  in the unfamiliar maze of Neriak's merchant district, a connecting alley proved to be a dead-end.<br><br>Abandoning pretense, he placed his back to the alley's end and pulled free his blades, a light rapier and a short weighted dirk.  His followers remained at the street's edge until they could advance together.  They were silent, wasting no effort to engage him in dialogue and needing none among themselves, confirming Rene's fears.  In an odd way, their professionalism was a small comfort.  Even against complete ruffians, he could not hope to survive six-to-one odds.  If his assailants were sent by one of the noble houses or a related faction, however, there was a chance that the goal was kidnap and ransom rather than the more lethal alternative.<br><br>Once massed, the six Teir'Dal approached casually down the alley, their demeanor businesslike, weapons drawn.  Short blades or heavy knives settled in their hands--there would be no kidnapping.  At least, Rene thought ruefully, they had not chosen to keep him pinned in the alley and shower him with bow fire.  He would get a fight, no matter how vain.<br><br>"Can I help you gentlemen with something?" he asked perfunctorily, amused at his own words.<br><br>"We could make this easier," offered one of them cordially without slowing his approach.<br><br>"Whispering breezes, secrets swirl, abruptly ending with one last twirl."  An overly-loud, drunken singing cut through the tense silence.  Quick glances were exchanged and two of the men moved away, back down the alley towards the source of the racket.  Straining to see past intervening shoulders, Rene could discern a drunken servant stumbling around the corner.<br><br>"Hey!  It's the young Lord Rene!  I've been looking for you!" the menial shouted.  The man closest to Rene turned his head toward the sound and Rene pounced.<br><br>Rene lunged past the man, skewering his companion with the rapier.  As he passed on the forward surge, Rene swept the dirk backhanded, slashing through the distracted man's throat before he could recover.<br><br>The attack dropped two opponents in seconds but it almost killed Rene.  The weight of the sagging corpse pulled the rapier down and away; the slash left his other arm thrown wide.  Rene pitched desperately backward from a reactive slash from the third attacker, across his chest, tearing flesh and cloth, breaking hard on Rene's collarbone and ripping away through the skin of his upper arm.  Had it been a lunge rather than a cut, Rene would have been dead.<br><br>As it was, the gorge rose in his throat and his vision dimmed briefly at the pain before training and shock blocked it from his mind.  Rene half-stepped closer to his attacker, using his body as a temporary shield against the fourth man.  The rapier was still hung.  Rene released it and trapped his attacker's sword arm with his own before he could recover.  Frantically, Rene hammered the man's head with the heavy pommel of the dirk.  The two spent deadly seconds  jerking and twisting, both men slick with blood, desperate for grip and footing.  Rene turned the dirk, sawing clumsily on the other man's neck while the fourth attacker maneuvered for a clear stroke.<br><br>Wrestling, the two drove hard into an alley wall.  Blistering stars of pain danced across Rene's vision as the collision vibrated through his shoulder.  Metal clattered on stone as his attacker's blade was knocked loose by the impact.  Rene shoved him away and pistoned the dirk into his ribcage.  The man fell and Rene slumped against the wall, gasping, waiting for the killing stroke from the assailant he lacked the strength to turn to face, let alone fight.<br><br>A snapping thrum, a warm wetness splashing across him…<br><br>"Let's go," growled a very sober Keeper at Rene's side.  "If it were me, I'd have sent a follow-up squad."  Rather than respond, lost in a haze of fatigue and shock, Rene wondered if he should have recognized the Keeper's voice earlier.  They would move soon enough, right now he needed to sit down, to catch his breath…<br><br>Rene screamed as fire washed across his wound.<br><br>"Pure dwarfin whiskey, strongest alcohol in the world and I'll do it again if you don't get up."<br><br>"I can stitch you up in the Warrens.  Cut's not as bad as it could be.  Missed the tendons, only nicked the bone.  I've fixed worse."<br><br>"Just get me back to Third Gate and the priests can fix me."<br><br>The Keeper sucked his teeth loudly before replying.  "Whose House?  Any idea who sent them?"<br><br>"No," Rene admitted tiredly.<br><br>"T'Veren is my guess but it doesn't matter.  So, young Lord Rene, who do you trust?"<br><br>The alley was silent save for Rene's heavy breathing and the faint plops of a distant dripping.  "All right.  Help me down to the Warrens."<br><br>***<br><br>"Do you have to cross-stitch them?"  Rene hissed through clenched teeth.<br><br>"No."<br> <br>"How many more?" he asked when it became clear that no further explanation was forthcoming then yelped as the Keeper, literally, used his chest as a pin-cushion.  The menial used teeth and both hands to tie off before retrieving his curved needle.<br><br>"Done.  Want me to fix the shirt?"<br><br>"No, no, that's fine," Rene replied hurriedly, not convinced that the shirt would be removed from his body before more stitching occurred.  "My cloak will do until I get home."<br><br>"Good.  Strip to the waist then, I want to apply an unguent and full bandage.  I've no inclination to bring you back and cut out an infection."<br><br>Rene complied, his motions slow and gentle.  "You're left-handed," he commented as he undressed.  To his surprise, the Keeper had removed an elaborate contraption from his hand before beginning his careful surgery.  Hidden under the bandages, Rene now knew, was not a mangled hand, but an intricate bladed gauntlet, currently still wet with blood.<br><br>"I know.  Raise that arm as high as you can.  I don't want the bandage to slip.  What will you do next?"<br><br>"Go back.  If whomever is behind this was secure enough to strike within the House, they'd have done it already.  That's how my father would have done it, anyhow.  I think I can safely rule out Lady Even'gel.  I'll seek her advice."<br><br>The Keeper grunted in agreement as he wound strips of cloth around Rene's ribcage.  "You're loyal to her then?"<br><br>"Of the entire House, she's the only one who cares about me.  I think she truly does care, about me, I mean, not just for politics.  Yes, if any of them could have my loyalty, it's her."<br><br>"Good.  When you leave, you can take the first batch of her cordial up to her.  I'll finish the next and bring it up tomorrow.  That's actually why I was in the Down Under--replenishing my stocks."<br><br>"Lucky for me you were.  This cordial, it will help her?"<br><br>"Put your arms back down and I'll wrap across the shoulder.  Yes, the cordial will address her symptoms.  Warn her of its use.  It is very strong, very dangerous."<br><br>"How?  What's in it?"<br><br>"Ashroot, wormwood, empolomine, handful of other things--urge her to use it sparingly."<br><br>"If you say so."<br><br>"I do.  Listen, if this soaks through, have one of Lady Even'gel's maids change it for you.  They're not as useless as they try to look.  Take a deep breath and hold it while I pull this tight.  Good.  That should hold.  Wait a moment and I'll get the Lady's cordial."<br><br>Rene pulled his cloak over his newly bound shoulder and waited as the Keeper made his way deeper into the clutter of his workspace.  While he waited, Rene turned his attention to the Warrens outside, looking across the cavern and its contents with mild interest.<br><br>"Nice collection," he commented solicitously as the Keeper returned.  "Lots of variety."<br><br>"It's T'Ere's menagerie.  I just keep them alive.  A lot of these beasts don't fare well in captivity, worse yet underground.  They lose the desire to live.  I gather that they're quite a source of pride for his Lordship."<br><br>Rene was suddenly more interested.  "They're important to him then?"<br><br>"Indeed.  Some more than much of the House itself, I'd venture.  The Feir'Dal, for example, is almost an obsession for him.  He visits near daily to see it."<br><br>"A light elf as a pet?  I'd love to see him."<br><br>"Her."<br><br>Rene nodded, looking away to try to hide the excitement on his face.  Innocently enough, the Keeper might have given him the weapon he sought against T'Ere.  "I'm a bit lost.  You can show me the way back?"<br><br>"Of course."  Pressing a silver flask into Rene's hands, the Keeper motioned with his head for Rene to follow.  "That's the Feir'Dal's nest there.  Don't disturb her; I've quite a bit of trouble getting her to sleep.  If you follow that passage there and stay to the left, you should reach the Third Gate without incident."<br><br>Rene nodded and walked several steps down the passage before pausing.  "And you?" he said, turning to look back at the Keeper, "Who are you loyal to, Keeper?"<br><br>"Why, Lord Rene, these lowly creatures are my only concern.  I've no ambitions beyond their well-being."<br><br>Rene laughed and walked away down the passage.<br><br>"I couldn't help but notice," chirped a voice behind the Keeper, "that the tunnel you sent him down is not the one I usually see used.  Could it be you have repaired him only to send him into a danger of your own making?"<br><br>The Keeper clucked his tongue.  "You are too suspicious, dear Kathrin.  He will reach home whole and hale."  He walked past the Feir'Dal who was still curled on her side as if sleeping.  "I merely feel some family secrets have been kept too long."<br><br>

ooc: Oh, dear.  I thought this board had been deleted after trying to find it for a few weeks.  I just sort of tossed the things I had begun, so I need to dig it out again.<br><br>Hello, Lulee!!! I am happy you are here!!  I miss you Father Des.  I do not see you in Norrath anymore.  <br><br>I shall be adding as soon as I catch up on the story. <br><br>Sir Kelleher, I always enjoy reading the things you write.....but I am sorry your real life is not going terribly well.  Good luck to you.<br><br>Carezzia
