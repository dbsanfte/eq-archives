Jimmee, thank you for your thoughtful response.<br><br>(All quotes are from Jimmee. )<br><br>"Why do you care if you're KoS to the server because you choose to play the game the way you want to?"<br><br>Because I do not wish to give offense to the majority of the society I live (in this case play) in.  I will do so only if required to by a moral imperative.<br><br>"It's because you're scared of what people <B>who don't matter in the slightest bit</B> think of you."  (I added emphasis.)<br><br>We disagree on that.  One reason I don't respect you much is that you are so quick to dismiss other humans as not worthy of consideration.   Other people matter to me, even if I disagree with them.<br><br>"It's called spinelessness =)"<br><br>Or courtesy.  Depending on who you ask.<br><br>My path to happiness in real life and in the game is to try to make everyone around me better.  It think this is especially important in my rl job.  If I dismiss someone as worthless and alienate them, I am not doing me or the society I serve any favors.  That can eventually lead to Columbine.  I have seen amazingly good results by showing unjustified faith in people. <br><br>And I don't treat people respectfully because I'm scared, spineless, or feel like I have no other option.  I do it because at first, I believed in it, and now, I've seen it work.
