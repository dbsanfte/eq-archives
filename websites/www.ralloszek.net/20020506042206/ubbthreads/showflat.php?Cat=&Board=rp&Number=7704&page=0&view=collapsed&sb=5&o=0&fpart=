The Continued Adventures of Kelleher Ivyelm<br>Chapter 3- The Exile of the Sword<br><br>	Wind blew harshly over the frozen Velious landscape. Eastern Wastes was perhaps<br>the longest leg of the trade route from Freeport to Thurgadin. For only a little over a year,<br>trade companies (Legitimate, and the other kind too...) had been traversing the trecherous<br>stretch of land, from the scortching sands of Ro, to the deathly frigid Ice Clad Ocean. The<br>route was perilous, infested with everything from roudy orc tribes and desert bandits, to<br>frost giant marauders and a legendary sea turtle devouring skiffs whole (if you believe<br>what they say anyway), but the pay off was worth the risk (to those adventuers who<br>survived, especially those who took the cut of their fallen comrades). Travelers from the<br>Old World made a killing exporting platnum, diamonds, hides, tropical fruits and various<br>alcohols (The Coldain say it helps keep them warm) and trading for valuable Velium,<br>exotic hides, and blue diamonds. There was also a fairly active mercenary and wepons<br>trade, as the Coldain were waging a war on all fronts, and paid particularly well for<br>artifacts or ‘Specialists’ which might give them an edge over their foes. The caravan<br>sought refuge from the chill at one of the small Coldain outposts along the way, as the sun<br>was setting. To stay out much later would be to tempt faith- and the horses would have<br>frozen to death anyway. After settling down around the camp fire inside the round hut, the<br>party of adventurers began making perparations for the night. Cloaks and rolls were laid<br>upon the floor, and a walrus, which the caravan had come across, was being butchered<br>and smoked, by a troll who seemed to know what he was doing. Wepons were sharpened,<br>entries were made in logs, bottles were opened, and sentries were posted near the door...<br>but not quite far from the warmth and light of the fire. The howls of dire wolves could be<br>heard in the night air and the travelers were glad to be where they were. An hour and a<br>half or so after night had fallen, a heavy wind kicked open the thick hide covering the<br>enterance to the hut. In the moment the wind lifted the flap, a dark figure had slid in,<br>ignored by the lazy eyed sentries. His shadow was pitched against the wall and shook with<br>the movements of the fire. Slowly, as if stepping from another spectrum of light, he made<br>himself visable. A figure of slightly below average height stood there, his form obscured<br>by the bulky brown cloak he donned, a hood hidding his face. What was the most distinct<br>feature of the traveler was an intracately decorated lanyard quiver strung over one<br>shoulder, and an ornately carved longbow over the other. As the first of the weary traders<br>noticed him placed their hands on the hilts of their wepons, he said, in common, “Hail.” A<br>human, who had made the run a number of times and was, for lack of a better term, the<br>leader of the expedition, got to his feet, rapier in hand, and pointing the blade of his wepon<br>to the newcomer, said “Hail. Explain yourself. Quickly.” Another breeze kicked up the<br>flap and forced the fire down for a second, darkening much of the enclosure. When the<br>light returned the traveler had slid back his hood, to reveal a fairly youthful, but wind<br>burned and sullen face. His eyes were a light glossy green, a tired, morose look spread<br>across his face. The contours of a frown held his thin pale lips. His hair was unkempt and<br>tustled, and barely visable beneath the crown of dirty brown locks, were the tips of the top<br>of his pointed ears- clearly elven, although one easily could’ve taken him as human by the<br>plain looking features of his face. “What explanation does a weary traveler need for<br>wanting the protection and warmth of fire on a night such as this?” By now all of the band<br>had roused and drawn their wepons, forming a semi-circle around the stranger. A dark elf<br>in worn chainmail holding two long, rusted dagers sneered, “Lets just dispatch this refuse<br>and have end to this.” A few of the more bold members of the group muttered agreement,<br>after so much traveling not being very enthusiastic about anything. The stranger turned his<br>head and glared in their general direction, and most turned away, not able to take his gaze.<br>He returned to the human, “I am a lone ranger, I assure you, that I am of no threat to you<br>and your band. I mearly spend my days hunting this frigid land, and make a living selling<br>the hides, furs and meat. I mearly would have the warmth of your fire and living company.<br>If you would that I left, say it now and I will do so.” The human, lowered his guard. “You<br>are welcome to stay, Sir...?” “Ivyelm.” “Well, Sir Ivyelm, I am Ghareed. You are<br>welcomed to stay for the night, that is if you could favor us with a tale of your travels. Its<br>my experiance that rangers are never at a shortage for those.” A grin went across the<br>ranger’s lips. “Yes. Yes, I could do that. Thank you Sir Ghareed.” The rest of the group<br>had already returned to repose, some of them begrudgingly. The ranger remained where<br>he stood, and a human, curious of this turned to him. “Why do you not come forward,<br>closer to the fire, Sir Ivyelm?” she asked earnestly, her smile as warm as the blazing flames<br>of the hearth. He looked at her and the flames, almost longingly, but sadly, and replied, “It<br>is probobly best that I keep this distance madame. Thankyou.” <br><br>	After everyone had settled in more, a few bottles were being passed around, and<br>stories were being told. Ghareed, sitting on one of his packs near the fire, smoking a pipe,<br>said, “Well, my good Sir Ivyelm, why don’t you pay the afore agreed price and tell us a<br>story?” The ranger had made himself comfortable (that is to say, as comfortable as such a<br>paranoid individual gets). He had unrolled a few taned and treated hides, and proped up<br>his bags as make shift cushions. He was on his haunches on the skins, his arms folded to<br>his chest. “Very well. Of what would you have me speak?” “Of might!” Said the deep<br>baratone voice of an ogre in the back of the room. “Of magic!” Said a high pitched voice,<br>belonging to a gnome in a neatly starched and brightly colored robe. “Of cunning.” Said<br>the dark elf of before, twirling his blades around between his fingers non-chalantly. The<br>young woman who spoke before, was laying on the ground propped up on some rolled up<br>clothes, and looking up said, “Speak of the war of good and evil, of order and discord.<br>Some grand adventure, Sir Ivyelm!” The ranger paused and looked around, and then<br>looked to himself intently. “Some grand adventure...” He muttered. “Very well, I think I<br>know what I will speak of.” He shifted and got to his feet, and drew from beneath his<br>cloak a long golden sword’s hilt. As the hilt, lacking a blade was unschiefed, there was a<br>slight hum and a clear, milky white form of the missing blade materialized. The ranger<br>moved it gently, it reflecting the light from the fire clearly, as though it were glass, though<br>also eminating a dull white glow. Those who were not paying attention before looked on<br>the blade in wonder and amazement. He ran a hand up and down the blade, a slight shift in<br>the ethereal energy occuring when his fingers touched it. He then returned the blade to his<br>side, disapearing beneath the contours of his cloak. He returned to his haunches, and,<br>using a rather long, archaic looking dager, appearing to be of ancient Combine in oragin,<br>he drew a circle in the ground. He clarified by cutting a cresent shape in the circle. The<br>moon. Luclin. As he scratched out the image he spoke: “Quite some time ago I found<br>myself on Luclin. Was then that started a series of events which tied the soul of myself, to<br>the soul of the wepon I showed you before. I suppose that is the nature of the wepon... It<br>ties its’s self to it’s weilder. It is a part of me and I am a part of it... Even now I can feel<br>it’s pull...”<br><br>	The small green figure was drastically obscured by the looming gothic archetecture<br>of Katta Kastelum. The lamp light from streets and windows reflected in the puddles<br>forming on the street from the falling rain. The sky was gray, and occaisionally there was a<br>flash of lightning, and a dull crack of sound rumbling in the distance. He passed though<br>shadow and light, pressing towards the massive cathedral looming in the distance. He<br>could smell the damp soil of the graveyard outside of the building, and he tread softly over<br>the hallowed ground. As he climbed the stair to the massive, wooden doors, they opened,<br>slowly, creaking. Instantly, the cold, damp ranger was hit with the warm, dry smell of<br>inscence and dust. As he stepped in, the heavy doors closed behind him. He ran a hand<br>through his wet locks and proceeded down the vacant aysle. He found a set of stairs, and<br>walked down a few flights, in almost complete darkness. Finally, he came to a lightly<br>luminated corridor, which he slowly walked down, his boots clanking against the smooth<br>flagstone. He could make out the small figure of the elderly custodian of the catacombs.<br>He was a Halfling, dressed immaculately, although he himself was quite clearly aging. He<br>had a whispy puff of white hair sitting on the top of his head, and thick white side burns.<br>He turned to the ranger, who, out of respect, bowed. The halfing returned the bow<br>piously. “Did you find the missing artifacts?” He asked hopefully. “Yes. I believe these are<br>what you said were taken from the tombs?” Said the ranger, removing a few trinkets and<br>handing them over to the halfling. He looked them over, squinting to make them out in the<br>dim light, and a smile spread across his face, “Yes, yes, these are the artifacts. How did<br>you find them?” It was a long story. The quest for finding the items removed from the<br>crypt by grave robbers had taken him across the face of the moon. It had been a perilous<br>adventure that pitted him against creatures he had never before encountered on Norrath. It<br>was, however, a way to prove his affiliation to the people of Katta Kastelum, apparently<br>the remnants of Norrath’s own Combine Empire, and hopefully, get them to tell them of<br>how they came to be on Luclin. Perhaps more important than that, he could recieve an<br>account of history that had been lost on Norrath. He would take note and return it to<br>Surefall for the druids and other wise ones to pour over. Rangers like him were always the<br>vanguard into new territory. He was a seasoned scout, having combed over and<br>doccumented lands South and East of Surefall, such as Kunark or Velious. He had risen in<br>rank simply by returning with his life. The halfling turned around and walked down the<br>corridor further, and turning, motioned for the ranger to follow. “You may think I’m an<br>old sentimentalist, for wanting these dusty heirlooms back... But you see, they are very<br>much important to those in my charge... The dead, they tie themselves to such objects<br>from their life. They are restless when they are removed and they can only know true sleep<br>when they are returned. Ah, here!” The halfling stopped abruptly and removed a small<br>wooden case from the wall. He opened a little brass latch and placed the items in it,<br>closing it and handing it to Kelleher. “Here, place this on top of that sarcofygus please.”<br>The ranger took the old container and, cautiously, walked towards the stone case. As he<br>approached he could dimly make out what looked like ancient combine carvings, not<br>unlike those sometimes found on ruins and runes on Norrath. He could vaugly make out<br>the image of a tall warrior in plate armor, standing gravly, chisled in stone as well. He<br>placed the box on the tomb and stepped back. As he did a pale white force of energy<br>pulled around the box, lifting it into the air where it disapeared completely. The whisp<br>turned into a hand, which, with the gesture of it’s fingers, held a newly materialized<br>wepon. “Take it,” Whispered the halfing. “It is a gift from the spirits for aiding them.” The<br>ranger grinned, and, reaching out, took the hilt of the wepon in his hand. As he did, he<br>staggered a moment, feeling the wepon draw out his life’s force, lowering his strength and<br>stamina. The blade pulsed to life, and he drew it back, bowing to the hand as it<br>dematerialised in a wave.<br><br>To be continued....<br><br>Kelleher Ivyelm<br>47th Level Half Elven Ranger<br>The Archer of Rallos
