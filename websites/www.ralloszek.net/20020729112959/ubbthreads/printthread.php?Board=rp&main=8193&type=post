Much had happened to Carezzia since that bad dream.  Baltiscan had delayed his trip to Neriak, had a brief battle with the assassin, which thankfully had been successful on his part.  He also insisted they marry before his trip to Neriak, giving her only a week to prepare, and while he was at it, decided he did not want to risk her traveling with him to the dark lands.  She had tentatively promised to abide by that decision, but only in a roundabout way, to her thinking, so she did not consider it a binding promise.  However, he seemed satisfied with it.<br><br>Once decided, the guild house was a flurry of activity during the next week.  When Carezzia would arrive from her own guild house, she would sneak through the back of Baltiscan's study to get in, avoiding the entrance doors and anyone who might be there, only because every person she met would shove a goblet into her hand so he or she could make a toast of congratulations.<br><br>She came close to being congratulated to a wine induced coma.  After the first few days, she only pretended to drink, knowing she needed to keep her wits about her.  Baltscan found it humorous when he noticed her mildly tipsy one afternoon and commented, "'Twould be wise to hide when you see one of my guild's members, love, if you plan on actually accomplishing something.  None of them are likely to let a drinking opportunity like this away from them, especially Jeboda."  Baltiscan either had a very high tolerance, or else he hid it much better than she was able, because she didn't notice him turning down a single goblet.<br><br>Sneaking past the kitchen a few days before the ceremony, she ran into Searra and Ozymandius, both wearing aprons and having the look of sprinkled flour about them.  In the crook of one arm, Ozymandius was carrying a huge bowl filled with creamy batter, while mixing it with a large wooden spoon in his other hand.  Searra had a wooden spoon, too, but no bowl.  She was apparently trying to make a point and waving the spoon for extra emphasis, but judging from Ozymandius' face, the spoon was not having the desired effect.<br><br>After a quick, anxious glance to see if there were any bottles within reaching distance, and finding none, Carezzia relaxed and greeted them, followed by, "I did not know you could bake.  What are you making?"  <br><br>The batter looked extremely enticing and Ozymandius suddenly grinned.  "A cake.  Your cake.  Didn't Balti tell you?  I can already tell it is going to be VERY good."  <br><br>Searra gave Ozymandius a level look, and somehow Carezzia got the idea that Ozymandius had been doing quite a bit of taste testing.<br><br>"You both have done too much already!  Methinks you are working harder on things than I."  Carezzia gave them both a hug, Ozymandius' very carefully since he had his hands full.<br><br>A few days earlier, they had asked Carezzia to their home in Surefall Glade, and presented her with a beautiful wedding outfit they had obtained with the help of Lady Kealynn.  Baltiscan had mentioned, no doubt a tad bit amused, that Carezzia was in a tither about finding a full outfit to wear in a week's time.  She had quite a bit of mismatched armor and some very informal druidess dresses she liked to wear while walking barefoot in the forest, but nothing she felt suitable for her wedding.<br><br>They could not have known she was looking for something in forest green, yet the soft wicker outfit was exactly the shade for which she had been searching.  Baltiscan had mentioned to Carezzia many times that his favorite color for her to wear was the color of a leaf, and that he loved the scent of leaves and wildflowers she always seemed to carry with her.  It was perfect.<br><br>*************<br><br><br>"I do not have much time," Carezzia whispered into the wind.  The breeze, gentle one moment and more forceful the next, seemed frustrated as one who could not talk, but had much to say.<br><br>Though her eyes were closed, she could see.  No longer on the flat path that led into the forest, her mind carried her to the height of a large hill, the wind still rushing to speak.  Robes of the palest blue, foreign to her, fluttered with the forces of the breeze as she stood at the top of the hill, her bare feet uncovered by the movement of the hem.  It was as if someone else had entered into her imagination and taken her body elsewhere.<br><br>She turned; from what catalyst, she did not know.  A noise, a glimpse of movement?  It seemed natural to know what was there without warning, though, and she was unafraid of the dark cloud that moved toward her.<br><br>"I must find him," she murmured.  "Tell him I need him."<br><br>Thousands of whispers filled her ears, overlapping one another so as to make it impossible to discern the meanings.  Some were small voices, others deep, and the languages were varied, many, she suspected, murmurs of languages long dead.<br><br>After straining to hear, one voice seeped through, though it seemed to be the softest of them all, speaking in a language she did not know, but could understand.  <i>Nae.  He is not done.</i><br><br>"I need him."<br><br><i>He has much to do.</i>  The voice caressed all around her, as though touching her, sometimes heard louder behind, sometimes in front.<br><br>"I need him."<br><br>The voice softened more, yet it seemed to be even more easily heard to Carezzia's ears.  <i>The message will be passed; your impatience shall be blamed for the consequences it will bring.</i><br><br>*************<br><br>Carezzia had not seen Sir Descourg in almost a year.  It was not unusual, she had been told by Dark Destiny, for him to do so, and that she should not be worried when such events occurred.  Still, it was odd to her and she wondered how Lady Dark endured it for such long periods.<br><br>She spent her mornings at her guild house moving her things.  Now that she was being married, she had to compromise, unless she wished to live apart from her husband.  It wasn't only her things she took; she also repainted the room to its original color, removing any touch she had given it.  When she was done, the total essence of her presence was removed, as though she had never existed.<br><br>Now she returned, with company.  Walking back with the last of her items tucked in her bags, she was followed by a snorting little bear and a black panther, grown large and sleek.  Carezzia had not yet named the panther, always just calling her "Cat", although she kept mentioning needing to name it one day.  The bear belonged to Sir Descourg, and was in her safekeeping until his return, whenever that would be.<br><br>Her instincts told her something was not right with Sir Descourg and his situation.  She felt an unease when she tried to hear the voices, and when she asked questions they refused to answer.  Sometimes her palm burned hot at the spot his pebble shards had entered her skin.  <br><br>She needed him now, for her wedding, and did not let the voices intimidate her this time.  Although she had been adamant, she was still surprised it worked, and looked for him wherever she heard sound.  Not knowing where he was, how long it would take to get the message, nor how long it would take to get to her, she had no idea of when to expect him.<br><br>***********<br><br>She was delighted to find him waiting at the Covenant of the Wolf guild house when she finally reached it.  He looked worn, she noticed, and his eyes did not immediately meet hers, as though looking at her would tell her of things he did not wish her to know.<br><br>Dropping her things, she flew immediately into his arms as he gave her a fatherly kiss atop her head.  "Father Des, I knew you would come!!!"<br><br>"What is it that called for such haste, pet?" he asked when he looked down at her.  "The urgency of the message had me on edge.  I have worried leaving you alone, even with the pets and a home you can turn to for help. "<br><br>"'Tis not bad news, only good.  I am getting married, finally, and you must give me away!"  Her news made him relax, and it wasn't until he did so that she realized how tense he had been.  <br><br>He snorted.  "That may or may not be good news. Depends on who it is." He stepped back, and she noticed his dust covered bags.  "Is it Baltiscan, or have you pushed him aside for another beau I have not yet approved?"<br><br>Carezzia gasped as she bent to collect her bags.  "Shame on you!  Of course it is Baltiscan."<br><br>Heaving a sigh, he gathered his own bags, looking around for a direction to go.  "Aye, I thought so."<br><br>Seeing his look down the hallway, she moved ahead of him and he followed her silently to a guest room just off the main hallway.   "I have a few things to do, pet," he said, as he dumped his worn bags onto the red silk comforter covering the bed.  "I'll find you later."<br><br>"I shall be here the rest of the day, Father Des," she answered, a little indecisively, watching him a moment before she left the room.<br><br>It was not like him, she thought, to be so distracted and seem so worried, especially when he would catch her eye.  To her, Sir Descourg had always been self assured, knew his way around places and people she would have been afraid to be in or know, and was never one for silence when he had the opportunity to speak.<br><br>She puzzled over the oddity as she hurried back to her own room.<br><br>********************<br><br>A wedding is a day of celebrating the union of two who want to become one; the beginning of a new life together and as such is given the same reverence by most races and classes of beings.<br><br>Weddings also could drive an otherwise normal elf insane.  Or so Carezzia found out on the day of her wedding.<br><br>It was beautiful, but in retrospect, it all seemed a blur, with a mix of friends from various guilds, her beloved fiancée, Father Des, and all three of their guilds.  Lady Raveena conducted the ceremony, and Lady Kaldarye added a blessing of Hate that Carezzia was still mulling over.<br><br>As after most weddings, the bride did not feel she spent enough time with each guest, or thanked them well enough for the wonderful gifts they gave before becoming distracted with the next event coming along.  The comfort she took, though, was in being assured by every married female within hearing distance that they had felt the same at their weddings, also. <br><br>It DID have added interest, though, a little beyond the norm.   Shortly after arriving at the Island in Lake Rathe, the spot Baltiscan had proposed to her, they were set upon by murderers, causing the wedding to be moved to the Arena.  Carezzia was upset at being married in an Arena of battle at first, but then finally conceded it was probably the safest place in which to be defended.<br><br>Besides being married in an arena, a wedding guest was attacked by other guests.  It was Greon of No Tears Initiates, and he had the audacity to call her a witch during her own wedding and to protest to the union.  Mayhap because of those reasons, the attack did not bother her so terribly bad, but the ensuing threat of a guild war when Lady Kaldarye married herself to Greon did.  It happened shortly after Baltiscan and Carezzia wed, in the ensuing celebratory chaos that followed the ceremony.  Because of the chaos, Carezzia did not know the details, but only knew Lady Kaldarye began sporting Greon's family name and <a href=http://boards.gamers.com/messages/message_view-topic.asp?name=cotw_roleplay&amp;id=zzzwm>proclaiming herself as his wife.</a> <br><br><br>Now, as she sat thinking of all this in hindsight, she could not help the feeling that Sir Des was not himself.  What forging had he needed so long ago when she was rescued from her temporary slavery in Neriak? He had not returned with her, and the first of her mysterious voices had come to her at that time, telling her that Sir Des would not be leaving Neriak with her.<br><br>Had this been what affected him?<br><br><i>Ye shoulda looked. </i>It was soft, almost only a thought except that Carezzia could hear the words of a voice that did not belong to her.  She should have been used to them, but knew she never totally would be.  <i>Ye shouldna let yer fear rule ye.  Ye shoulda looked inta tha water . </i><br><br>"The water," she whispered, remembering.  Lady Jolene, the Queen of the Faeries, had told her to look into the waters when she was ready, but she had not been ready.  That day, she had absorbed too much and needed to think on what she had learned first; that her sister had been the mother of someone she knew in her old guild, The Order of the Righteous Blade.  So close, he had been, but now he was gone, and so was anything she may ever have known of her dead sister, save a little picture Sir Kaolinn had given her once.  She only had that because she wished to learn more of Quidluanne and knew Sir Kaolinn's mother had once known him.<br><br>It seemed long ago, and so much had happened between then and now.  The day she could not look into the magic pool was the day she learned more of her father and mother, and at least partially what had happened to them.  It was too much, and she could not go further; she had been too much of a coward to know more.<br><br>She had not told the faerie queen she could still hear the voices after those first few days.  She heard them frequently, but they came to her when she least expected it, during thoughts in which she would lose herself and usually always from thoughts of the past.  But, what of the future?  Would they still come to her when the secrets of the past were unraveled, or would they disappear forever?  The whispers had become a part of her and she did not want to lose them.  <br><br>Would gazing into the pool completely end the queries of what had been, leaving only what was to come? It seemed as if she was being told, again, which direction to go.<br>
