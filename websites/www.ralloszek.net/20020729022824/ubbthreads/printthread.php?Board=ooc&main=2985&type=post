Mleh, <br><br>Just to clarify a few things,  for one you did not have to tell me what it meant to roll.  I knew that long before you came along.  Don't forget that before there was even LoL me, Blasta, Mulletx, Dargaoth, Casta, Arudii, Pharrow, and Emphyzema were out pking together.  And we would have to "roll" for items.  So sorry to burst your bubble, but I already knew about it.  <br><br>Secondly, LoL does not give me my items.  I have to buy my own items with the money I earn.  Pking with LoL has helped me earn money by selling items that I have won through rolling between a group.  But in the end I am the one who takes the money out of my account and pays for it.  I do admit LoL gives me good prices when I buy the items off of them, but then again we are guild and we are there to help each other.   That is the one thing I totally love about this guild.  Everyone in this guild is loyal and will be there in a heartbeat if you need them.  And that's what makes our guild #1.
