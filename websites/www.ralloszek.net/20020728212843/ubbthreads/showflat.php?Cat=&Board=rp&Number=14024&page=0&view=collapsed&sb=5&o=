(ooc--RL has been very busy and the plot arc for Bitter Ashes has proven to be a much more ambitious undertaking than I had at first expected.  Since it takes place before Carezzia's wedding, you can see that I'm quite behind.  Still, I think it is a good tale with a good deal of insight into the personalities involved and I think it bears telling.  I should be getting back to it soon and have posted, below, a breif of the major characters in the tale to make it easier to follow the continuity.)<br /><br />Persona Dramatis:<br /><br />The Clan Destined:<br />Descourge Darkdestiny--Patriarch, adopted son of Joleena, High Preist of the Fey Court<br />Darkdestiny Descourge--Erudian, unofficial Matriarch of the clan<br />Aluleeana--Eldest child of Descourge<br />Lulee--Youngest child of Descourge<br /><br />House Rileaus:<br />Lord (R'lean) Rileaus--Patriarch, deceased<br />Lord Rene Rileaus--Youngest and only surviving son of R'lean, ward of House T'Ere<br /><br />House T'Enel:<br />High Lord T'Ere T'Enel--Patriarch, youngest High Lord to ever ascend to the Council of Nobles<br />High Lady Even'gel T'Enel--Matriarch, wife of T'Ere<br />Lord Garet T'Enel--Only child of T'Ere and T'Enel, deceased<br />Lord T'Vern T'Enel--Seneschal of the house and childhood friend of T'Ere<br /><br />The Majilenne Family:<br />Arthur Majialenne--Patriarch, staunch foe of T'Ere, deceased<br />Kathrin Majialenne--Matriarch, imprisoned by T'Ere for decades, widely considered deceased<br />Carezzia Majialenne--Only surviving child of Arthur and Kathrin, travels with the animal companion Cat, raised in seclusion by Quildluane, she is largely ignorant of her family's past<br />Kaolinn the Gentle--Unacknowledged child of Carezzia's older (now deceased) sibling<br /><br />Miscellany:<br />Dranerius--Minor noble charged with maintaining deliveries to the docks of Freeport, betrayed by the Keeper to T'Ere, deceased<br />Keeper (of the Warrens)--Menial charged with the care of T'Ere's menagerie<br />Marlowe--Fuzzy, cuddly bear<br />Princess Joleena (of the Fey Court)--Adoptive mother of Descourge, highest ranking member of the Court to interact with the mundane<br />Quildluane--Adoptive parent of Carezzia, deceased<br />Serrapoth (of the Fey Court)--High Priest of the Fey Court prior to Descourge's ascension to the position, deceased<br />

T'Veren slid awkwardly into his chair amidst the clink of flatware and clatter of glass, acutely aware of how underdressed he was for the establishment.<br /><br />"My apologies..." he paused as a purple liveried waiter reached to pour water from a crystal decanter before continuing.  "Your summons did not leave me time to change into proper attire."<br /><br />"An invitation to dinner is hardly a summons.  Order what you wish; I'm buying and mine is already on its way."  The ogre sitting opposite T'Veren had already commandeered roughly two-thirds of the table with cups and plates.  Despite being in Neriak's Foreign Quarter, the ogre was an oddity, large even by the standards of his own people, belying the agility T'Veren knew he possessed.  The bright red uniform of the Hand further emphasized his unique status.<br /><br />"From you, Chief Inquisitor, any suggestion is an order."  The waiter fluttered at the edge of his vision.  "Just the bread..."<br /><br />"Bring him the almandine I had earlier and another plate of appetizers.  Oh, and some wine.  You must try the wine, Veren.  The red tastes of butter."  The ogre gestured and the waiter bustled away.  "Drop the 'Chief Inquisitor'.  We've known each other too long."<br /><br />"Fair enough, but don't pretend this is a social visit either."<br /><br />"Your call."<br /><br />"Right."  T'Veren sighed.  "My call.  Out with it."<br /><br />"Carried six of your men out of Down Under.  I'd like to know why."<br /><br />T'Veren screened his facial expressions with his water glass.  "What makes you think they were mine?"<br /><br />"We can play that game if you want."  The conversation stopped as a waiter poured the wine, placed a breadbasket at T'Veren's elbow, and, finally, slid a silver platter in front of the ogre.  Resting on a garnish of yellow grass was a black oval, easily two feet long and almost as high and wide.  "I'd like to keep this unofficial.  Formal inquisitions are, well, messy.  Don't you agree?"<br /><br />The Teir'Dal nodded.  "So, Chief Inquisitor, my friend, tell me about your day."<br /><br />"How nice of you to ask, friend T'Veren.  I was quietly sorting papers at my desk when I received a message from one of the 'Goon squads."  The ogre's tone began mockingly then dropped to a smooth rumble as he warmed to his tale.  "Alley full of bodies, not unusual in that area, but they were a little too professional for simple thugs--no personal effects, well-groomed, at least based on the remains, and not locals.  You know how, when you ask around, nobody knows anybody but you can always find some shopkeeper or other who says 'yea, usta shop here, dunno nutin' else'?  Not this time.  The 'Goons ran the usuals and no one even blinked.<br /><br />"They did turn up something else interesting, though.  It seems that the young Lord Rileaus had been traversing the area earlier.  Now, call it a hunch, but I think this all might be related.  It's a bit too early for T'Ere to start trying to arrange accidents for the boy but--oh, let's say another house wanted to stir up trouble.  Naturally, I thought of you.  Security for the House is, after all, part of your job and it would be a shame if something were to happen to your ward."<br /><br />"You're right, the wine is good," T'Veren noted casually.  "You said you thought the six men were mine."<br /><br />"Did I?  I must have misspoken.  Or perhaps they were yours, protecting the young Lord from possible ne'er-do-wells, of course."<br /><br />"Of course.  Doesn't matter too much, I suppose.  For simplicity's sake, let's assume that I did send them after Rene, in theory.  That isn't really enough to merit the attention of the Hand."<br /><br />The ogre nodded.  "True.  What one House does to another is not my concern.  Heresy and the security of Neriak itself, on the other hand, does."<br /><br />T'Veren was suddenly chilled.  "The incident with the Fey was settled decades ago.  What are you driving at?"<br /><br />The ogre did not answer.  He hefted a silver hammer with a rounded head and struck the black oval on the plate before him.  Two more sharp blows followed and the blackened surface cracked along a central seam.  The ogre worked the silvered jaws of a spreader into the split and twisted.  The shell burst open with a cloud of superheated steam to reveal puffs of a white meat inside.  "Relax, I'm not accusing you of anything."  He dug out a piece of the blanched meat with a two-pronged fork, dipped it in a nearby dish of melted butter, and popped it delicately into his mouth.  Without waiting to chew, he resumed speaking.<br /><br />"Let me ask a question.  In theory, if you had sent those men after Lord Rileaus, would you have any idea what killed them?"<br /><br />"None whatsoever.  I'd like to know that as much as you."<br /><br />"Good, I am theoretically relieved.  What about T'Ere?  Any idea if he was involved?"<br /><br />T'Veren shook his head.  "Not that I know of."<br /><br />"That makes it a safe bet that he wasn't.  I appreciate your assistance, Veren.  Anything else going on in the House?" <br /><br />"Nothing new, if that's what you mean."<br /><br />"Hmm.  Let's go back to the beginning then.  T'Ere moved against Rileaus because Rileaus interfered with a shipment in Freeport.  Mistmoore perhaps?"<br /><br />T'Veren shook his head.  "Routine shipment.  My turn for a question.  Why?  Some thugs die in an alley, how does that bring the safety of Neriak into question?"<br /><br />The Inquisitor gestured with his tine.  "Try this beetle, imported from Seb.  The six men died in two groups.  Best guess is they were interrupted.  Three went down deep in the alley, standard blade work.  It would appear that young Rileaus is good when he has to be.  Fourth body was also in the same area but the throat was torn out, no sign of teeth or claws, it looked to have been removed by brute force--knifed through the throat and levered out.<br /><br />"The other two bodies were at the mouth of the alley, very different story.  One had two holes in its chest, nice clean spikes, straight in, straight out.  Its back was cut to pieces, maybe used as a shield after he died.  And the last, the last body was stripped to the bone.  I've seen bodies like it but only after they've been dead for a few weeks.  Bugs, Veren.  Eaten alive by some kind of swarm.  Green husks were imbedded in some of the remaining tissue.  There are some priests that can summon swarms but nothing green--all of our people summon black beetle or carrion flies.  This was something different.  I'd guess Tunarian."  The ogre set his utensils on the table and fixed T'Veren with an unflinching glare.<br /><br />"The heresy of the Blue Queen spreads through your, our, people every day.  Despite my repeated admonitions, your Council of Nobles allows agnostic magi to shelter within the sacred walls of the city itself.  Our enemies storm the gates of Neriak.  How do we survive, Veren?  How is it that, beyond surviving, we prosper?<br /><br />"It is because of the gods, because of Innoruuk.  The gods have rules and boundaries, limits to their powers and where their followers may go.  Neriak is strong because it is a holy site and, therefore, under the direct protection of Innoruuk.  An avatar of Marr will not bring havoc to our city, no more than an avatar of Innoruuk will invade the halls of Felwithe--because the gods protect what is theirs.  We can send agents and war among each other but the gods will not, perhaps can not, act directly.<br /><br />"Unless!"  The ogre thumped the table for emphasis and flatware leapt.  "Unless we turn from them.  Unless we let heresy breed among us.  Unless we violate ancient bans and oaths.  Innoruuk protects us but only because we serve him.  And because we do not invite others in!  We can invite trouble, direct actions of the gods themselves, and forfeit the protections of Innoruuk.  House T'Enel did that once:  you offended him and his protection was lifted.  It will not happen again.<br /><br />"Let me be very clear on this:  if I even suspect that a House has invited doom into Neriak, I shall not hesitate to cut the heresy out."<br /><br />T'Veren gulped dryly and fumbled with his water glass, suddenly reminded that he faced one of the heads of the Inquisition within Neriak, one of the great powers who had no respect for rank or privilege, religious zealots with no restraint and little regard for life.  He swallowed again, well aware of how close to the edge of heresy his House skated, continued to skate even now.  His thoughts went again to the Feir'Dal imprisoned within the warrens.  "What can I do to help you, Chief Inquisitor?"<br /><br />"I don't know.  Thus far, I have little more than an anomalous death which may or may not be related to your House, or to anything else for that matter.  I want you aware and vigilant.  I want immediate report of anything that seems out of the ordinary.  I want any new menials who have joined the House retinue after, let's say the initial trouble with Rileaus, sent to an oracle to have their weird cast, in case you have been infiltrated by Mistmoore."  The ogre paused to eat another forkful of beetle.  "And most of all, T'Veren, I want you to know that, if anything happens, I'm coming for House T'Enel first."<br /><br />***<br /><br />Carezzia stared at the pool and bit her lip.  After all she had been through, the idea of scrying through time did not frighten her as much as what she might see.<br /><br />"The past,"  the Princess Joleena whispered beside her.  "I don't understand how it is controlled, if it is, but the pool will show you what is needful for you to see."<br /><br />"Will you see it too?"<br /><br />The fairy nodded.  "I will guide you as best I can."<br /><br />With no small trepidation, Carezzia brushed the surface of the water with her hand, watching images form like watercolored paintings...<br /><br /><br /><br />Two men in a dank cell.  One chained and haggard, the other free and robed in darkness and midnight blue felt, leaning on a gnarled staff.  Rush torches burn, one in the cell, others in the hall beyond.  The clink of keys and rustle of guards outside.  And somewhere, faintly, singing.<br /><br />"You are a thief," the cowled man said.  His voice was deep and smooth, almost without inflection, the purring of a tiger.<br /><br />The returned gaze was through swollen lids, the reply through blood-crusted lips.  "I am no thief."<br /><br />"That is too bad.  I had need of a thief.  I suppose I have no use for you and must leave you here to die.  I had high hopes for you Quildluane, very high.  Sorry to have troubled you."<br /><br />"Wait," rasped the prisoner.  "How do you know my name?  Are you one of them?"<br /><br />"If, by 'one of them' you mean the League, that answer is no.  I rather think that my presence here would upset them significantly.  No, I represent an interested third party.  But I needed a thief.  A thief with a conscience, true, but nonetheless a thief."<br /><br />The young Quildluane sagged against his chains.  "What do you need stolen?"<br /><br />"A simple thing.  A child."<br /><br />"No deal.  I have stolen songs, nothing more.  Better to die than be part of some evil that taints my immortal soul."<br /><br />The hooded figure nodded.  "As I said, a thief with a conscience.  I swear to you, there is no evil to this endeavor, save perhaps to prevent it.  The child is marked for death, even now its assassins move against it.  You must steal it to save its life.  A moral imperative, I would say."<br /><br />"Then why don't you save it?  You're the wizard."<br /><br />"What an odd assumption.  Why would you say such a thing?"<br /><br />"In my cell, in their dungeons, claiming not to be one of them?  Either you are a mage or a liar."<br /><br />"Ah, Quil, you truly are young.  Have you never heard of a bribe? That is why I need a thief.  I need you, in specific.  You know the ways through the League's Halls and can move with stealth where I cannot.  Come now, are you my thief or not?"<br /><br />The captive lowered his head wearily.  "And what of me if I am?"<br /><br />"I offer your freedom, to be sure.  That alone should stir you to action for your accommodations hardly seem to your liking.  But I will offer you more, rewards such as you cannot now imagine, and amnesty.  When we are done, your petty thefts will be long forgotten."<br /><br />"No one owns a song.  I am no thief; I am a liberator of art.  The League of Bards can no more own music than a druid can own the sky," Quildluane muttered.<br /><br />"Interesting analogy.  Have we an agreement?"<br /><br />"We do."<br /><br />The figure moved close, touching the rusting manacles which bound the other man.  They fell away at his touch.  His cowl gaped open to reveal white hair and beard, grey eyes the color of storms, aquiline features on a skin of chalky blue.  "I am called Serrapoth.  Listen well for we have little time..."<br /><br />Furtive movements in the shadows of the tree city of Kelethin.  Rope and grapple in the stillness of the woods.  Halls of wood, tapestried walls embroidered in golden threads in themes of lyre, pipe, and drum, the faint strains of music--dance and song.  An impromptu nursery, little more than a closet with a crib.  A babe, tiny, elfin, fierce eyes and futile cherub fists, unwatched in her sanctuary.  Bundled by Quildluane into a swaddled pack.  She did not cry.  And away, flight through the forests, unpursued, to meet with fairy courtiers in Lesser Feydwer.  Fairy and thief raising the girl, waiting, waiting, for a Serrapoth who never came...<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Carezzia drew away from the pool, her fingers wet, sweat upon her brow.  "That was me!  He stole me!" she stammered at Joleena.  "My most trusted friend, my mentor--he stole me!"<br /><br />The fairy princess brushed the elf's hair with a gentle hand as she cried.  "Hush, child.  All is not yet clear; look again.  Hush now and return to see."<br /><br />***<br /><br />The Keeper paused in the hallway, his ears catching the strained shouts of an argument.  Deciding that he could afford to delay his audience with the Lady Even'gel, he stepped to the closed door of T'Enel's office and cocked his head to listen.<br /><br />"We're talking about the Hand of Innoruuk!  This is the Inquisition, the Temple, the heart of power in Neriak, we can't just ignore it!"  The voice was T'Veren's, strained and almost pleading.<br /><br />"Relax, Veren.  Nothing has changed.  Whatever crimes we committed are long in the past."  T'Ere answered calmly, his tone disaffected.<br /><br />"Maybe, but this all started over the girl."<br /><br />"We lost the girl.  She's gone again and I'm deprived of my revenge.  Whatever might have happened didn't."<br /><br />"We still have Kath...the Feir'Dal.  What of her?  The Inquisitor suggested Tunare."<br /><br />"Doubtful, Veren."  T'Ere's voice became conciliatory.  "Listen, no servant of Tunare could survive in Neriak and remain strong.  We learned that with the Feir'Dal.  She's wasting away and all Tunare can do is let her die.  And I doubt that the Keeper is any threat to us.  He might be a spy from Mistmoore but even if he is, it's nothing that would concern the Hand.  Do as the Inquisitor asks.  Send the menials to the Oracles to be read and we'll deal with anything that arises from it.<br /><br />"For now, rest easily, cousin.  These events may not be related at all and certainly, they pose no threat to us."<br /><br />T'Veren sighed.  "As you say, m'lord."<br /><br />Outside, the Keeper pressed a gloved finger to the metal lips of his mithral mask, nodded to himself, and hurried quietly down the hallway.<br /><br />***<br /><br />"I can't," Carezzia whispered, her voice shuddering, her hands trembling.<br /><br />"You will," replied Joleena and shoved the Feir'Dal's hand into the pool...<br /><br /><br /><br />The creak of tree limbs, the groans of wood.  Fire crackled, instruments played.  The noises that passed for silence were deafening.<br /><br />A young Feir'Dal mother, newly widowed, sipped gingered ale, sharing dinner with a gaunt-faced elf, sallow and bald.<br /><br />"I can not express my gratitude, Guildmaster.  To rest, to know my babe lies safe within these walls..."<br /><br />The bard waved away her words and did not meet her eyes.  "Do not think on it; the Majilenne name is known to us.  Your husband died fighting the Mayong, did he not?"<br /><br />She looked away.  "You are a gracious host, but I must leave you soon.  I have no doubt they will be coming for my daughter and I."<br /><br />The bard shifted uncomfortably in his chair.  "The Teir'Dal?"<br /><br />"House T'Enel; T'Ere's men.  He's not the type to let Arthur's actions go unavenged."<br /><br />"I cannot help you there.  My order has no influence within Neriak.  I hope to change that soon enough."<br /><br />"Don't!"  Kathrine snapped.  "You cannot entreat with evil!"<br /><br />"I should have anticipated that reaction, given your recent travails, but I do believe you are oversimplifying the matter."<br /><br />"I'm not," she said with curt severity.<br /><br />The Guildmaster fixed his eyes on his plate.  "I'm sorry.  That was insensitive."  Kathrin did not reply.  The meal progressed in awkward silence.<br /><br />The pastel waters blurred and time sped by.<br /><br />Quildluane had been gone from the nursery for almost an hour before Serrapoth moved from his own place of concealment.  The child was safely away, and now his work began in earnest.<br /><br />"I have been away too long.  Dinner was pleasant.  I must return to my daughter."  Kathrin began to stand, then stopped as the bard grabbed her arm.<br /><br />"Please, stay.  Just a moment longer."  His grip tightened, his wan features were distressed, afraid and tense.<br /><br />"What are you--"  She cut short her protest as two strangers, one tall, the other taller, human, stooping in the bardic halls, entered the dining room.<br /><br />"This is her?"  asked the tallest, a voice as ice, the hunger of winter's winds howling.<br /><br />From his companion:  "It is.  Beyond question, it is."  The slithering of a snake, a simpering whine striated with command.  Hunger here too, a glutton's greed, never satiated.<br /><br />The Guildmaster released her arm.  "You must understand, Kathrin.  I have the long-term interests of the League to consider," he said, looking away, sullied.  "If we can establish a toe-hold in Neriak..."  His voice trailed off, drained by the spinelessness of his argument.  He edged toward the doorway.<br /><br />"Who are you?" she demanded, her voice fierce with maternity.<br /><br />"Oh, you know me."  The human visage wavered briefly and the serpent grinned.  "I wanted to attend to this personally.  We have so much to discuss, you and I."<br /><br />"T'Ere!"  Kathrin's voice was a mixture of horror and hatred.<br /><br />"And let me introduce my cousin, Veren.  Now where's that little girl of yours?  I'd love to meet her."<br /><br />Kathrin surged for the door, frantic.  The one called Veren caught her in his arms, pulling her toward T'Ere.<br /><br />The heavy wooden door to the dining room slammed.  The sound of the bolt sliding home was deafening.  A new voice spoke, soft, weary, resolute.  "I believe you have larger concerns at the moment."<br /><br />"I wondered when the fairy would come out of hiding.  Run out of people to hide behind?"  The rictus settled across T'Ere's face; the snake turned to coil.<br /><br />Serrapoth took a single step to one side, blocking the Guildmaster's slinking  retreat.  The fairy priest lowered his cowl and smiled indulgently at the disguised Teir'Dal.  "We're done here," he said to no one in particular.<br /><br />A shout, a blur of motion.  T'Veren shoved T'Ere with his shoulder, falling with him through a window, Kathrin still struggling in his arms.  A elder oak, quiescent in the night--its crest exploded, consumed in a fulmination of power, suddenly a torch large enough to light the continent.  Flaming debris breaking loose, falling like drops of crimson blood, spraying sparks and blazing cinders in renewed storms of fire on impact.  Kelethin ravaged...<br /><br /><br /><br />"Kathrin's body took most of the impact when T'Veren shoved them all through the window.  Even landing atop her, T'Ere broke both legs and it would be years before T'Veren healed from his burns," Joleena spoke quietly at Carezzia's shoulder as she pulled back from the pool.<br /><br />"So they lived?"<br /><br />Joleena continued as if she had not heard.  "The fall broke every bone in your mother's body.  She never healed."<br /><br />"They killed her?"<br /><br />"Eventually.  Best not to worry about it now."<br /><br />Carezzia almost screamed.  "Not worry!?  They took my life!  Killed my family!"<br /><br />"And revenge has been taken!" the fairy shouted back over the Feir'Dal's growing hysteria.  "It is over.  You are free from it.  Free from fear; free from the need for revenge.  It's done.  The debts are already paid."<br /><br />"But I was just captured by T'Ere.  He&amp;#8230;"<br /><br />"Has now been dealt with."<br /><br />"He's dead?"  snarled Carezzia.<br /><br />"There are worse fates than dead," the fairy replied.  "Rest and we will speak again."<br /><br />"That can't be all.  I need to know.  I need to understand what it was all for.  Please!"  The girl's voice was desperate and pleading, thickened with grief and stress.<br /><br />The fairy studied her in silence for long minutes then nodded, once.  "Sleep first.  The pool draws its energies from you and you are fatigued beyond your knowing.  You will see the rest.  I hope you are strong enough to understand."<br /><br />***<br /><br />The Keeper knelt, tapped the floor with his knuckles, then rose and moved deeper into the room, closing the door behind him.  "My apologies, m'lady.  I was detained."<br /><br />The Lady Even'gel waved away his words.  "We had not even noticed that you were late.  Our days pass easier now.  We summoned you to give thanks."<br /><br />"The cordial works then, m'lady?"<br /><br />"Too well," muttered Rene from a chair by the fire, its back deliberately turned to the meeting.<br /><br />"We are reborn, favored Keeper," Even'gel purred.  "Our life is made bearable.  Ah, but only just, only just."<br /><br />"I do not understand."  The Keeper tilted his head slightly to one side.<br /><br />"From the past to today, it as if we have been lifted from the deepest pit.  Yet, from today to tomorrow, we would have you lift us to the heavens."  As she spoke, the Keeper noted that her affected tone, imperial and husky, hid the slur creeping into her words.<br /><br />"Certainly.  We shall speak of it anon but I have yet to pay my regards to Lord Rileaus, if you will allow it?"<br /><br />"Rileaus?  Oh yes, Rene.  Of course.  We shall await."<br /><br />The Keeper looked at Even'gel cautiously then moved to kneel at Rene's side.  "We should talk," he whispered.<br /><br />Rene snorted.  "Talk away.  She doesn't hear anything that isn't spoken directly to her imperial self and sometimes you have to shout even then.  She's in her own world most of the time."  His tone was disgusted.<br /><br />"How much is she drinking?"<br /><br />"Of your blasted concoction?  The initial flask, the cask you sent up afterwards, and she's almost ready for another.  It's constant now; she never has a glass of it farther than arm's reach."<br /><br />"And the use of the imperial 'we'?"<br /><br />"Fairly recent, but she uses it now even when she's talking to herself."<br /><br />The Keeper growled low in his throat.  "Way too much.  I warned her.  I warned you. Wormwood can cause hallucinations and empolomine addiction toppled the Combine Empire."<br /><br />"Out of my hands," Rene said dismissively.<br /><br />"Out of mine now," the Keeper snarled and stood.  "Forgive me, great Lady.  We were discussing your affliction?"<br /><br />"You have our forgiveness, favored Keeper.  In our eyes, much may be forgiven you.  We no longer live with fear.  We no longer await our husband to make decisions.  We are as a true noble woman."  Even'gel took a deep theatrical breath and gestured broadly with her hands before continuing.  "But it is our husband whom we now must treat.  As our afflictions have been set aside, we ask that you now advise us in the treatment of our husband's."<br /><br />"The High Lord has fallen ill?"<br /><br />Even'gel laughed, high and shrill.  "Naught so simple.  It is a worm which has long grown within him.  There is no connection between us.  He is his own man and we are left to deal for ourselves.  This we did not even see until you opened our eyes.  You must help us to find a bridge into his heart, a meeting place of our affections.  Fair menial, we would have our husband back."<br /><br />"Forgive me.  I have been long out of the noble courts and your manner of fair and courtly speech has left me perplexed.  Let me ask plainly to see that I understand you wishes.  You want me to speak to the High Lord about--well, renewing his affection for you?  M'lady, I am an animal keeper.  Perhaps such matters would be better suited for a member of the priesthood or another family member?"<br /><br />"Family?  I fear T'Veren, in his way, is my fiercest rival."  She poured a glassful of her cordial and gulped it.  "No, we do not want talk.  We want actions--another tonic, an herb, whatever you feel is necessary."<br /><br />The Keeper sighed heavily.  "Dear lady, it is beyond my power.  I am no hedgemage to offer you false promises of a love potion.  Even between animals there is, in truth, no certain way to force these things.  A marriage must be an act of will, a thing of commitment and effort.  The rest will follow naturally.  As you have said, you must find a bridge to him, but it must be you who reaches out.  You have a shared past, there is much between you already.  Build from that.  Dwell on what you share and encourage him on these matters."  He studied the expression of her face carefully as it sagged into disappointment.  He hesitated, waiting as she sank back into a chair and dropped her face into her hands, before placing his next statement.  "You must find a shared spirit."<br /><br />Even'gel did not respond.  The Keeper waited then asked, "Lady, are you well?"<br /><br />"We shall maintain," came the answered, muffled by her hands.  "You may go."<br /><br />The menial shifted uncomfortably from foot to foot.  "A shared spirit, m'lady."  He partially turned towards the fireplace.  "Lord Rene, were my directions sufficient to lead you back from the warrens?  It was a longer route but easier to follow."<br /><br />"It was simple enough.  It would have been even simpler if you had mentioned the big, sealed door.  I was convinced I had made a wrong turn."<br /><br />"What door?" interrupted Even'gel, suddenly aware of her surroundings.<br /><br />Rene twisted in his chair.  "One of the tunnels in the Warrens has a double door--right on the side of the passage.  Iron bound door sealed with chain, lock, and the T'Ere signet sealing the lock--I was convinced I was going to come up in Lavastorm or somewhere."<br /><br />The Keeper watched as Even'gel's expression changed, becoming contemplative, calculating.  "A shared spirit indeed.  Beloved Keeper, you have been more than helpful.  If you will leave us now?"<br /><br />The Keeper lowered his head and pulled his cowl forward to hide his mask.  "A pleasure, m'lady."  His tone was satisfied.<br /><br />
