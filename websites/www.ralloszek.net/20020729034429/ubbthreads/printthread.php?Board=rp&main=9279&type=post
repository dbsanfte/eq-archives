[ooc-As if anyone actually cares but:  these things take place after the Bitter Ashes story arc.  Because I am lazy and slow, that story arc is not finished and completely  posted yet so a few things here might seem out of place.  My apologies for that.  Even more confusing when one considers that, within her own story, Lulee is using a 5 year flashback.  Anyhow, Bitter Ashes is a historical tale, taking place immediately preceeding Carezzia's wedding if that helps.]  <br /><br />Now, to the sordid tale:<br /><br />No scent, no sound--the wolf was alone, again.  He should go after her (despite what his children thought, he could track them, even through the ether).  He should set the house to order, place locks and wards, and see to the disposition of the body.  The list of things he should do was very long, and largely inconsequential.  The beast stretched out on the floor, muzzle on paws, and sighed heavily.  ["I'll be sure not ask for it."]<br /><br />The house creaked as it shifted in the wind, wood against wood.  It was a comforting sound, a homely sound.  And no longer true, the wolf told himself and continued to ignore the long list of pending duties.  For a moment, he resented having all the arrangements suddenly thrust upon him, then suppressed the feeling with another weary sigh.  ["I'll be sure not ask for it."]<br /><br />He considered eating the body.  Sael would have understood but the wolf decided that too many others would not.  That left the elements.  The wolf considered the small graveyard in Western Karana where much of his family was already interred.  It was customary among the Teir'Dal to guard the newly dead until decay set in--one of the hazards of a heavily necromantic culture--but he did not have the patience for it.  Water and sky burial were each out of the question for similar reasons.  [I'll be sure not ask for it."]<br /><br />Why had she said that?  Surely she must know that he had always tried to be a good father. . .<br /><br />It was within his power to have the corpse placed within the mausoleums beneath Neriak or even to bear it directly to Innoruuk, though both would be politically difficult, but Sael had renounced much of his dark elfin heritage.  Such options seemed an ill fit.  Fire then, the wolf reasoned, the great cleanser.  [I'll be sure. . . ]<br /><br />The air crackled and smelled of ozone.  A chill wind blew across the wolf's back.  His ruff and hackles rose instinctively and he half-rose before growling in irritation and flopping back to the floor.<br /><br />"Still moping?  I swear, you're worthless."<br /><br />"Not now."  The wolf let the form of his throat and jaws melt to a more flexible form to reply in the lilting tongue of the fairy.<br /><br />"I expected you wouldn't be up to dealing with this.  I've sent word to that winged mini-elf 'mother' of yours.  The ghosts are tracing your whelp in case she gets into trouble so feel free to sulk all night if you wish."<br /><br />"I said not now!" he shouted angrily, shifting to the harsh gutturals of the Erudian speech.  Violet eyes blazed at him out of the darkness, anger and concern warring within them.<br /><br />"You push me too often, old man,"  she said at last.  "Walk on two legs; the wolf is too visceral to reason with."<br /><br />"The wolf thinks clear:  fight, run, defend.  The pain is clean and simple."  As he spoke, the lupine features slid away, hair thinned and lightened, four legs becoming two.  Descourge stood, rolled his shoulders, and flicked closed the nictitating membranes of his eyes.  "I have to stay here tonight.  I have to sit with the dead and take care of the body."<br /><br />"I'll come back in the morning and tend to the body.  If I leave it to you, you'll burn the house down."<br /><br />"Since when are you opposed to burning something?"<br /><br />"Just don't, all right?  It's still Lulee's home."<br /><br />"Whatever 'home' means," the druid snorted.<br /><br />"You talk too much.  I'll be back at dawn."<br /><br />"He was a necromancer."<br /><br />"I'm not stupid!" the shadows snapped.  "The crypts of Erudia are well suited to dealing with the heresy."<br /><br />Descourge nodded.  "Thank you."<br /><br />"Again."  The darkness flashed with blue light and the druid was alone.<br /><br />"Again," he sighed to the empty house.  "I miss you too."  The milky film over his eyes retracted and he paced the inky blackness of the building with the practiced grace of a cat.  He went slowly, room by room, letting his fingertips trail across the woodwork of the walls, over table tops and desks, feeling and seeing the collected memoriam of his youngest child.  He stood still for long minutes at the doorway to the bedroom where his son-in-law's body lay.<br /><br />"I should burn the house," he growled angrily.  "Burn it to ash like everything else left of the past."  He spun, striding through the kitchen and out onto the porch.<br /><br />The moon was high and waxing.  The porch was built to overlook the waterfall and river where his daughter had been married and the rippling reflection of the moon flickered back at the sky.<br /><br />"That's what you leave me!" he shouted at the night.  "Ashes and regret!  You prune this family like a tree of hate.  Everything good and gentle you kill until only pain is left behind to bear fruit.  You have made us a clan of assassins!" <br /><br />The white-haired druid had advanced to the river's bank.  Now he dropped his voice, his tone suddenly gentle, resigned, and he began to unlace the heavy leather straps of the bladed gauntlet covering his left hand as he continued to speak into the still night air.<br /><br />"No man should outlive his future.  No parent should live to bury his children.  When you took Mab and left me to raise four daughters alone; I trusted you and persevered.  When you took Aluleeana's husband, the first son of my heart; I trusted you and persevered.  When the wasting sickness came again and you took Rain; I trusted you and persevered.  She was my only grandchild, the future of my family, the baby of my baby; but I trusted you and persevered.<br /><br />"When the twins rebelled, one to serve in Felwithe and one to become a bard; even in this, I trusted and persevered.  You sent me back into Neriak, to dip my hands in blood and mortgage my soul, to be your assassin in a war I barely understand, to kill innocents and wear the cloak of lies you fashioned for me; still, I trusted and, as best I could, I persevered.<br /><br />"But now?  Now you have taken my last son.  For myself, I could bear this.  Grief and I are old friends, you see, but there is more to consider this time.  I've made my peace, chosen my road.  She didn't.<br /><br />"I know the pain of burying a spouse and of losing a child.  No one should do both in one lifetime.  But I did.  And now, so has my baby girl; my precious, gentle child who has done nothing to ever deserve that pain.<br /><br />"I don't have a point, you know.  And I don't have any answers.  Once more, I'm supposed to trust you and to persevere."  The old druid sighed wearily.  "Not this time.  I'm sorry.  I'm all out of faith."  He slid the gauntlet from his hand and, spinning about, threw it far out into the river.<br /><br />"I quit."<br /><br />Where the glove struck, the river exploded, rearing up as a geyser of silver, roiling water that seemed to stretch from moon to reflected moon.<br /><br />/you go too far . . . <br />. . . shameful and weak/<br /><br />"I don't care!"<br /><br />/you still care . . .<br />. . . there is more to lose/<br /><br />"Threats?  That's how I am repaid?  Are the gods now unaccountable to their own?"  Descourge roared at the aquatic spire, caught up in the momentum of his own pain and rage.<br /><br />/you speak from grief, not reason . . .<br />. . . you whine as a child at the loss of a toy/<br /><br />"Life is not a toy!"<br /><br />/you would lecture us. . .<br />. . . you would presume to be a god/<br /><br />"You would presume to know my pain?"<br /><br />/we forgive you. . .<br />. . . we do not/<br />/you need rest. . .<br />. . . you need a weapon, no son of mine walks unarmed/<br /><br />The silver pillar became a falling column of rain and, for a moment, the night was still again.  Then the river erupted again, a silver lance stabbed up, into the druid, flinging him back against the stone cliff-face beside the waterfall.<br /><br />"Oh dear," he murmured, staring down at the elaborate scimitar jutting from his chest, pinning him to the rock behind.  "That's a lot of blood<br /><br />***<br /><br />There was a voice buzzing at the edge of his mind.  It was familiar but he did not know why.  Mab?  No.  No.  Destiny.<br /><br />"Only you," said her voice, distant but also close.<br /><br />"Must be dawn," the druid mumbled as she continued to speak.<br /><br />"Only you are stupid enough to argue with gods."<br /><br />He tried to laugh and choked, turning it into a cough.  "Finally got their attention," he whispered, oddly pleased with himself.  "Finally got an answer."<br /><br />"Dumb!  Do you know that?  Just dumb!  And who is always left to clean up you messes?  Hmmm?"<br /><br />"I think I may be a little hurt.  I can't exactly. . .well, I can't see.  Or move."<br /><br />"I know, there's blood all the way down to the river.  You're already fading back into the fairy realm."<br /><br />"The Glamour.  So I'm not dead then, that's good. . .need some rest. . ."<br /><br />"You need some common sense, you damned old fool.  Have you ever considered that your actions might effect other people?"<br /><br />"No."  He tried to hide the amusement in his voice.  It seemed inappropriate.  He was dizzy; hard to think clearly.  "I act then think."<br /><br />"I noticed.  Stay safe, Des."<br /><br />"I'll be back once I get some rest.  You know where to find me."<br /><br />"I do."  The Erudian sighed and watched him fade from view.  "I hate it when you leave me to watch the kids."<br /><br /> <font color=black>
