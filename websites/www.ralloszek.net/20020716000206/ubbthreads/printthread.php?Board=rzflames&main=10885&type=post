I guess this is the only place where I can speak my thoughts on this board anymore.<br /><br />I don't like people who cry racism when there was none involved.  I like it less when the board's admin backs up the fool because they're close.  Somehow, some people thought I was being racist.  I don't see it...<br /><br />So... here's the rant-<br />Datal-  Stop being a little boy and open your mind to viewpoints other than your own or the people who control you.  Just because you have the power to ban someone does not mean you should EVER do it.  You obviously did not read the whole thread when the only idea I got from ya was "lovaelihn, stop bitchin and moanin"... I claimed nothing about race, and your silly little girl stated I did, crying racism.  That stance is ignorant.    ( Lulee-  note my use of the word "ignorant" )  My opinion is this-  You got offended because many people called her names.  Awwww.... poor datal... did someone misuse YOUR toy?  =P  Cry me a fuckin river.<br /><br />Lulee-  You cannot even understand the most simple of my points, so unless you come up with something fresh, I am done discussing this with you.  Everyone who read that thread knows you to be a fool, and that is fine.<br /><br />So, in closing, I am sure that my opinion will probably get me banned although this is the place I was told to post it in...  ( See?  I am even following your biased self-righteous guidelines )<br />Oh well... Praytell... is this a place for discussion of our opinions?  Is this a place for discussion of YOUR opinions?<br /><br />The heading underneath the "OOC Forum says, "Forum to discuss all OOC topics."<br /> That should read "Forum to discuss all topics datal sees fit for his own viewing pleasure."<br /><br />Thanks, have a nice day.   :grin:
