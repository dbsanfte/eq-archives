I fully agree. PKing isnt dead on Rallos at any level.<br /><br />I'm not sure what Tuskadon means by "high level" but, assuming he means 60+, I can say that I have had encounters *in one zone* with the following in the last few days..<br /><br />Hateraid<br />Kirby<br />Aevanne<br />Vodiar<br />Nimbas<br />Scailed<br />Flawlex<br />.. and I think Psycholistic too, but that may have been a week or so back.<br /><br />That is in *one* zone, without looking for pvp, it just came. And no, I don't hate any of the above.. I am on a PvP server and it breaks the monotony of AA grinding very nicely thank you <img src="/ubbthreads/images/graemlins/smile.gif" alt="" />. <br /><br />If he means mid-50s, the The Curse are very active - others too I'm sure (they are green, don't really know).<br /><br />There are also plenty of PKs at lower levels (as I know from my alts). PvP can be fun at all levels, the high-level game has never been the be-all and end-all, though it is different.<br /><br />Of course, if we are talking about the planes beyond tier 1, then there appears to be little PK activity there (some, but not a lot). PvP is still there though, as in the recent wars involving AD, Wudan and co. PoP and the flagging system and the introduction of more non-PvP zones hasnt helped, but people are adapting and I see a new generation coming through along with some older hands and a new batch from Legends.<br /><br />Maybe Tuskadon meant PvP on rallos was dead *for him*? Well, RoP never made much impact and I know he had high hopes. This "team PK" thing that Dessimus went on about was never a flier anyway, just a means to dangle off LV as far as I could see.<br /><br />New PK guilds are already becoming known.. life goes on.<br /><br />I too remember Tuskadon as being anti.. then he went PK. I only ever ran into him once on-line, and he didnt seem to play any active part in the battle that I could see (he was with a few other RoP). <br /><br />Ok, he has moved to Sullon, and that may well suit him better than Rallos. I hope so, it's a game and everyone should go where they enjoy it most. However, that doesn't place him in any position to comment on the state of PvP on Rallos... nothing died when he moved on except his hopes of becoming a "face" on Rallos.<br /><br />Riatsila<br />
