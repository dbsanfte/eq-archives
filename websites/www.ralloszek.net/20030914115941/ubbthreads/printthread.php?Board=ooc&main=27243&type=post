Nobody was able to bind, so he was taking a nice risk for that long walk..hehe.<br />  <br /><br /><hr /></blockquote><font class="post"> <br /><br />Oh my god. Somebody remembered Sloan?<br /><br />Sloan was one of my best friends back in the day.  He, Chikii and I were always pal-ing around together.  He got tired though, of being a cash machine for casters somewhere in his 20s, and about that time, we all rolled halfling druids just for the heck of it (Babalouie, Sahsie and Fiddy were our names).<br /><br />Yes, that story about Sloan running from Halas to Freeport is 100% true.  He was the first barbarian in freeport back in those early days (our guild was called Mysterian Knights), and all the little human girls just kept falling all over him.<br /><br />Kinda like when I was one of the first monks to go to Felwithe.  I am actually pretty sure I was THE first one, but I cannot prove it.<br /><br />Sloan/Fiddy stopped playing EQ after about a year or so, and hasn't gotten back into MMOGs since.  Chikii and I still have intermittent contact with him.<br /><br />Also, I do not believe CC or KAAOS can seriously be listed in that list, because they quit the game before Fear was even patched in, much less first broken. <br /><br />Formerly,<br /> Amano Jyaku, &lt;Mysterian Knights&gt;, then &lt;Iron Crown&gt;, &lt;Seekers Of Divinity&gt;, and finally, &lt;Aesir's Chosen&gt;.<br /> Cancelled, not sold.
