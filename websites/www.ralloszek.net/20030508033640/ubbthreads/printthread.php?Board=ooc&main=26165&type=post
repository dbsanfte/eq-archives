The heart and soul of PKing on Rallos Zek hinged on the PK's that made a difference on the server. I don't know about you but I never had any real concern for FoH, AD, or any other PK guild other than Darkenbane.<br /><br />Straight PKing didn't take a major downturn a year ago. Not unless you're counting Darkenbane leaving before that. HiV didn't die, they were absorbed by Lucid Vision and it was a well known fact that Lucid Vision was a PK guild before that even happened. LV and HiV actually did joint raids for a brief period of time before they decided to join us. That was around 4 months into our PK career. Your information is misleading and untrue. PKing didn't decline with Flowers of Happiness and Vova, whoever that is. Unless you were a lvl 1-20, no one really cared about that kind of guild, and neither did I.<br /><br />Also, to clarify, LV was never a "wannabe HiV". About a year and a half ago, LV went into Fear and found HiV there. Three of us killed 5 of them, and they petitioned us. Lyndro made us duel for the plane. Hey, we won. Not only did we win that duel, we won it in a matter of 30 seconds. We never aspired to be HiV. Reason being is because we *ALWAYS* thought they were beneath us. If anything, they should have aspired to be us, not the other way around. If you or anyone thinks thats an insult -- I'm merely stating facts. I didn't give a damn about HiV.<br /><br />The instant a so-called PK starts worrying more about levels/gear is the moment his ass turns blue and he loses any credibility as far as being a PK spokesman goes? You are aware of the fact that Hamadryad went to Legends to gear up and level, right? Who are you to determine what a "real" PK is and what a "phony" PK is? I cared about my gear and levels as a PK because I wanted to progress and compete with the best, and help my guild. Was I not a PK? Not for nothing, but if you ask the general population who had more of an impact on the server (and not message board jargon) -- they'll say Vasten &gt; Nnuk. Shoon &gt; Nnuk. Mangar &gt; Nnuk. Hamadryad &gt; Nnuk. Laroux &gt; Nnuk. Darkahn &gt; Nnuk. Timon &gt; Nnuk. Guznuk &gt; Nnuk. Tuggo &gt; Nnuk. Heck, man -- I'm just pulling names out of a hat here, but you get the idea. You can spout all your pretty little nonsense to your message board cronies for a year as a ghost, and thats all fine and dandy, but it remains absurdly untrue.<br /><br />It's great that you have respect for the level 20-30 career PK's. I have more respect for people that leveled into Manaburn range, crazy AA range, and all that jazz, though. That was LV. While you were having fun tinkering with newbies, the real killers kept on killing.<br /><br />Fact is, LV made more of an impact than HiV did, or your guild did. It's fine that you want to dispute whether or not PKing died with LV. I'm sure it didn't, but lets not tarnish its name because of your personal grudges, and lets not make some silly illusion about its history either.<br /><br />"... Can't get flagged for exping in UberZone01? Well cry me a river -- Go kill someone, goddammit."<br /><br />If you're lvl 50 wizard.. not sure which level you were, you'd have no concern about going to PoP and killing people there, because those people are too high level for you, but for people that were 60+ those zones tended to make a difference, simply because thats generally where everyone *WAS*. There isn't a whole lot of game in Everfrost these days, you know? If you want to evolve as a PK, you go where the people are. Consequently, its in a place where you need flags to enter. So, what do you do? You go get them because no place should be safe from all. And if you don't evolve, no one gives a hoot about you. And not to be really blunt about it but, sound familiar?<br />
