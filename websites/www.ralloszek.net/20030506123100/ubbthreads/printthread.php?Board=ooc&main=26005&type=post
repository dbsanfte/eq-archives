Yes I would have to agree... PK's are still alive and going... I was PKed 2 times the other day... Of course I have no real stuff to take so I didn't care.  However both times I was PKed it lasted maybe 3 or 4 seconds.  I never really had a chance.  The first I assume by a wizard... hit by a 900 dmg spell then again by something else... so I died very very fast... the next time I died by 2 necro's hitting me at the same time as I was fighting 2 sentry's in Skyshrine (alone) and they both hit me with 600dmg spells... I had no chance... but hey all I have lost was a Owl Bear Earring and some shoulder items... of course I never replaced them but hey... they aren't the ones who annoy me... The ones who really get under my skin are the ones who are out to annoy people.  Like chain root/blind someone as soon as they zone in... I was rooted/blinded on a CR ... and while this was happening someone tried to revive me but took some time cause I couldn't see the screen to say yes I want a revive... very very annoying...<br /><br />Anyways... I never complained or sent hate tells or anything... just part of the life on RZ...
