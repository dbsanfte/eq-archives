I'm not sure there IS a lesser of two evils when both of the candidates:<br />a. Bend over backwards to appease the exact same special interest groups. <br />b. Crave the position of Governer not for what they can do for the citizens of the state they're trying to run, but because of the greater gain they personally stand to accumulate.<br />c. Are equally out of touch with the greater populace of said state. <br /><br />As far as the mudslinging goes, I would gladly have voted for the first candidate (or the only candidate, hell) that actually explained its platform clearly and concisely (even just a little) in their damn ads.<br /><br />When I see something like <br />Candidate A: Candidate B doesn't pay his taxes!<br />Candidate B: Candidate A lies!<br />Candidate A: Candidate B has the second worst attendance in congress!<br />Candidate B: Candidate A gives your tax dollars to big business instead of your schools!<br /><br />This only tells me that NEITHER of these damn idiots knows how to budget if the best thing they can think to do with their money is waste it insulting the other candidate. <br /><br />I always thought it would be a really good idea to put a limit on how much any candidate could spend on their election. It would be a good indication of how well said candidate handles his money, I think, and it would encourage maybe some people who aren't super-rich to run as well.
