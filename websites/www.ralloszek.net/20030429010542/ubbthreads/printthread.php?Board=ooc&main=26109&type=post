To each their own, obviously.  If you're looking for a PvE game, Shadowbane will not be the game for you.  The game centers around Guild and Nation politics, to include city building and city sieging.  It is very much a game about player interaction.  Shadowbane is dynamic, breathing model of a feudal society -- with all the cooperative and competitive implications thereof.<br /><br />As for the graphics... come on, I played early UO and EQ.  'nuff said.<br /><br />And Character Development... you're right, Levels 1 - 10 are very basic.  That is on purpose.  It gives you a chance to get more accustom to the controls and interface and slowly work on character building.  It isn't until you pick up your Profession and Disciplines later that you see the differences and how the early choices you made affect your character.<br /><br />And before anyone says anything about Level 10... that takes a long time. Forget what you know about the leveling curve in other games.  We have people Level 30+ within the first day or two.  Shadowbane isn't a leveling treadmill game.<br /><br />Races lack inspiration?  Not really sure what you mean there and the movement system may take a little getting accustom to.  Not all games have the same movement system, such is life.<br /><br />Everyone has their own opinion, of course, and, as I said in the beginning, to each their own.
