<blockquote><font class="small">So speaketh UulosPinksock_RZ:</font><hr> necro's are gay you know what necro's do on PVE raids? nothing but twitch clerics and sit there with their thumbs up their ass.<br /><br />bards on the other hand do everything withut bards your raids would FAIL!  <hr /></blockquote><br /><br />Funny, in every raid I've been on, with the possible exception of "yard trash" I've out DPS'd most everyone else there (and with PoP nukes and scf3 a necro holds his own quite well even on the short fights), and I have never been asked to combat twitch, although I'll gladly twitch during downtime if I'm FM and everyone else is low, or during rezzes, particularly if/when I'm the only one that survives and I have to drag the bodies somewhere safe and rez the cleric first.  On those occassions where the cleric doesn't manage to get camped, I'd hate to think of the hellacious CRs that would ensue were it not for a FD "suck necro" with an EE in his pocket.<br /><br />Necro's are also the second-best pullers there are (Monks do get a better FD).  Ive seen many a monkless raid that wouldn't have gotten far at all were it not for the necro FD-pulling single mobs.<br /><br />This isn't Kunark anymore, most big guilds learned a long time ago that DPS &gt; all, and that combat twitching is inneficient for the raid, as extending the life of the tank and generally the fight by 25-30 seconds isn't NEARLY as efficient as ending the fight 30 seonds or so sooner.  Any experienced/smart raid leader wants his necro's doing dmg, and IF mana is needed, they call for Mindwrack, which creates mana, as opposed to giving a net-loss of mana.... there's been TONS of threads of various guildboards breaking it down mathematically, so I wont bother here, but you did just prove that you have an ignorance of efficiently playing the high-end game that most people overcame long ago.  Maybe that's why you're still playing lowbie chars?  <img src="/images/graemlins/smirk.gif" alt="" /><br /><br /><br /><br />EDIT - BTW, not that he isn't a nice guy and all, but on the raids where our guild's ONE bard hasn't attended, I know I haven't missed him, nor heard anyone else remark that "if only the bard were here, things would go so much smoother!".. Personally, I'd rather have a Beastlord along than another bard, and yes, I do mean that as an insult <img src="/images/graemlins/grin.gif" alt="" /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
