... Diplomatic and tactful eluded you while you were furiously whacking your keyboard in a vain attempt at disputing what you thought I said instead of actually responding to what I did, in fact, say.<br /><br />[sigh]<br /><br />So be it...<br /><br />Impact, you say? That would depend upon how you define it.<br /><br />If your criteria is based solely upon killing some folks in a very specific level range... Congrats! I agree with you -- LV made a much larger impact upon a narrowly defined segment of the Rallos playerbase over the last year. Such feats haven't been seen since Legion of Legends went out of vogue.<br /><br />Now let's talk about Flowers. Even in their current form it would be ridiculous to try making a credible argument that they've had no impact upon RZ. Is there anyone on RZ that hasn't heard (or uttered) the phrase "GAH! u fukkin foh assholes SUCK!!!" on at least one occasion over the past few years? Hold an EQ Reunion 10 years from now and most present will have at least one Flower story to tell -- Unless Ruhi, Mearis or that monk guy with the "K" (Kuraki?) name shows up... Who the bloody Hell will be talking about you?<br /><br />As for my own inconsequential self... I haven't played EQ in roughly a month -- And I only logged in a handful of times in the months preceeding that. However (as happens everytime I take a vacation from the Arts) my first evening back will be spent fielding "Welcome back! EQ isn't the same without you!" tells.<br /><br />And here's the kicker: I'll get them from a myriad of individuals -- From that level 17 wizard that came to RZ after following a link to AD.Com and becoming inspired to the level 65 AD-Lite shaman that just wants to chat about how cool (pardon the pun) it was in EverFrost back when we were in our teens. How many peeps under level 50 even have the faintest notion of who you are unless they read various boards?<br /><br />Now it's all fine and good that you'd like to pretend that LV stormed onto RZ, took over HiV and went on to champion the PK cause until growing bored and moving on to bigger &amp; better things...<br /><br />... Well that kinda crud may cut it in some circles but if ya think that such a line of phooey is gonna bowl me over you'd best think again.<br /><br />Of course I'm aware you were raiding with TUS folks, silly -- We were going to grant ya membership once we were sure you weren't just goofing around for a few weeks as pseudo-PKs. Not because you were some Uber "PK Army" -- Simply because your blue past gave ya some experience/capabilities in PvE matters which we didn't have.<br /><br />So when the HiV folks went their seperate ways... The faction with more PvE aspirations decided to go with you. Not because of your long and enviable 2 week history of carnage... Just cause you had the classes, knowledge and experience to kill MOBs.<br /><br />Who am I to dictate what makes a "real" PK? I'm the guy that had killed every barbarian born on RZ for a 2 year period while simultaneously fighting the NMS (Naked Mage Syndrome), proving that not all PKs were 13 year old assholes and doing so in a fashion which entertained more people than it irritated -- All while the people I'm apparently arguing with in this thread were farting around in Transcendent Order, OOD and [gasp] Pre-PK Lucid Vision for 50+ levels.<br /><br />So if ya don't like it.. Don't read it.<br /><br />Artfully Yours,<br /><br />Nnuk<br />Master of the Arts<br /><a href="http://www.artfuldeath.com" target="_blank">Artful Death Gallery</a>
