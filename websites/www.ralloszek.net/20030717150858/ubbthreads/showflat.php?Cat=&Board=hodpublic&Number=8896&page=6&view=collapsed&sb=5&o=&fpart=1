----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Note: This is old Dane History, I dug it out from our former members board, both to preserve it and to have it available here for the reference. All that have something to say, feel free to reply, but if you do please stay *in character*.<br><br>Desperate put in some exceptional storywriting here...make a huuge cup of coffee and enjoy! ;o)   -Druuni<br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Furry builds itself, and not much else <br><br> <br>      DesperateMeasur<br>Posted On 06/26/01 04:34AM <br><br><br>~A crash loud enough to wake up the Lord and Lady of Antonica echoed through the silent halls of Dane Manor as Desperate crashed his axe down on and through the desk in his office. He had never been so enraged, his blood boiled, his one eye floated in adrenaline, locking on another target. A bookshelf. Another crash as the pages of history and legends that graced his office flew from the force of his axe.~<br><br>"What am I doing now? What is Dane." ~The warrior's giant foot crashed through the window knocking out the glass.~ "Damn you Rhyden why did you make me do that?" ~Spittle flew from his lips as he crused. Grabbing a log of past Dane events and chucking it through the now permenantly opened window~ "Who else?" ~The words were comming out with such emotion they would have been hard to understand had he directed the question to anyone other then himself.~ "Who else is gone? Leaving."<br><br>~Dropping a shoulder Desperate charged through his opened door, giving up complete control to the rage that burned inside. The wood splintered and then exploded into the hallway. A shard from the door slid under his armor and pierced his shoulder. His mind was unaware of the hinderance, but his body wasn't. Swinging the axe now with one hand, its razor's edge crashed into the stone wall with a brilliant display of sparks that were only reflections of the turmoil inside him.~<br><br>~His heavey boots clanked off the marble floor of the once great hall.~ "Tribunal? Are you looking down?" ~The axe crashed through the door of Desperate's personal quarters. Releasing the grip, he left the axe hanging. Shedding his armor was always a task, but in his current state, his fingers fumbled, his feet tangled and his body seemed uncooperative. Falling to the ground, Desperate ripped his breastplate from his chest and threw it against the wall, leaving a large dent in the armor and a chip in the wall.~<br><br>~The crashing of armor and cursing continued until Desperate was dressed in his kilt and war paint. In the cornor of his room, in front of his window was an alter. Where he had prayed many a night for guidence to his gods. Incense, some herbs, a few small candles and a dagger sat on it. Like a bolt from a wizards's palm, the warrior's hand shot down grabbing the dagger.~ "You forsake me? You forsake my family? I forsake you." <br><br>~Desperate made one final sacrifice to the tribunal, asking for not, offering only his hatred, the dagger slid acrossed his opened palm with a single smooth motion. Blood poured over the alter. Muttering a chant in his native language he had learned in ages past, Desperate drug the dagger over his bear chest. Then slammed the tip of the bloodied dagger into the alter with such might that the stone table accepted it. The blood from the dagger gave the illusion that it was the alter that was bleeding.~ <br><br>Deep Thoughts From a Shallow Mind<br>--Desperate Measures<br>Guild Leader of<br>The Hand Of Dane<br><br><br><br><br> Anger destroys everything until it is all that is left <br><br> <br>      DesperateMeasur<br>Posted On 06/26/01 04:52AM <br><br><br>~The rampage continued. The other members of Dane were either leaving the Manor to Desperate's tirate, or no one was here. His feet slapped bear against the marble now as he made his way to the great hall. The Hall of Dane. The hall he himself restored when all seemed lost.~<br><br>~Comming to Fuduce's picture first. Desperate looked over the portrait.~ "When I first took my place as Sylverdane's successor, you professed your loyality to Dane. You bade me not to forget your pressence even though it was afar. And I didn't. I saved your chair at the table." ~Desperate's hand motioned behind him and towards the officer's hall~ "And still you left." ~Desperate reached up and grabbed the huge framed slamming it into the ground.~<br><br>~Rollo's hung next. Shaking his head Desperate looked over it as well~ "You are like a ghost. Gone from out halls too much." ~Desperate pulled down this portrait as well.~<br><br>~Starweaver stood proudly next on the wall.~ "I once hailed you as a god. I must have seemed like a child in your eyes. But how long has it been since you casted those eyes to Dane?" ~Desperate pulled down the painted and tossed it in a pile with the others.~<br><br>~Larger then the rest, as in life hung Rudra. Desperate stood under his gaze for a moment. Looking up at his long time friend. Finally his words came out thick, Desperate was choking on them.~ "General Rudra. You once encumpassed what it ment to be Dane. You once stood as a measurment for all Danes to be compared. But now? As our walls fall? As our members fight each other? Now where do you stand?" ~Ripping down Rudra's likeness, Desperate brought it to the pile and slammed it down atop the rest.~<br><br>~Dia came down next, then Kvyn, Rhyden, Pepie. The pile grew higher in the great hall, and the walls grew barer. Myssi, Dreamwork, Secil, until finally every portrait from the Hall of Danes lay in one giant pile. With a groan and alot of strain Desperate lifted all of the portraits from the ground and carried them into the Officer's hall.~ <br><br>Deep Thoughts From a Shallow Mind<br>--Desperate Measures<br>Guild Leader of<br>The Hand Of Dane<br><br><br><br><br> <br>  <br><br> RE: Anger destroys everything until it is all that is left <br><br> <br>      DesperateMeasur<br>Posted On 06/26/01 05:12AM <br><br><br>~In the center of the room was a large granite table, surrounded by plush chairs. A few torches were always lit under the portraits of the Danes. Not Dane as in Hand of Dane, but Dane as in, Stonedane, Riverdane, Thunderrdane, Wynddane, Hipdane, Fyredane, Cleverdane, Hippidane, Lleudane, the people who wandered Norrath forever carrying the name and the spirit of Dane. Taking up the entire north wall was Sylverdane, standing next to Emaus, watching everything.~<br><br>~Desperate threw the portraits he was carrying on the center of the table. He walked behind the head chair, and pulled a bottle of firewater and a cigar from a cabinet. Sylerdane's eyes watched over everything. Desperate refused to look at his portrait, but could feel it staring at him. Desperate lit his cigar, and flicked the matches on the paintings. The table now held one of the largest bon-fires Desperate had ever seen. The heat seemed to have a soul, it pushed back at the warrior and the walls of the hall.~<br><br>~Desperate refused to give an inch to the fire. The heat from its blaze filled the room. Finally Desperate turned towards Sylverdane and raised the bottle, took a large gulp and threw it on the now inferno that blazed behind him. Desperate's eye met Sylver's. The flickering from the flames gave life to the painting. It seemed contorted under the dancing light with the same anger that burned inside of Desperate.~<br><br>"I realized somthing today Sylver. It took me a long while, but I finally realized." ~Desperate chuckled briefly~ "You obviously didn't choose me because I was quick of thought. But eventually the thought does get through my thick skull."<br><br>"With everyday that passes, Hand of Dane sinks further out of control. The name means less and less. I don't know half of our members any longer. And I don't believe they know you. Or what it means to hold your name. They think they are a new breed. They believe that the elders don't know what it is like anymore. And our ways are like that of the Dragon's, words that only discribe myth. And every time that Hand of Dane gets scoffed at, those with the name Dane are scoffed at as well."<br><br>~Desperate fell backwards, the fire singed his back. His head swam and his mind blurred. He pulled himself up and stepped under the portrait.~<br><br>"I tried. But I realized that I failed you." ~Desperate reached up and rested his hands on the base of the painting.~ <br><br>Deep Thoughts From a Shallow Mind<br>--Desperate Measures<br>Guild Leader of<br>The Hand Of Dane<br><br><br><br><br><br> <br>  <br><br> RE: Furry builds itself, and not much else <br><br>User Options:  Edit Message <br> <br>      Druuni<br>Posted On 06/26/01 06:33AM <br><br><br>One word slips to my mind....<br><br>(= Druuni, stubborn elven officer of Dane! *<br><br><br> <br>  <br><br> RE: Furry builds itself, and not much else <br><br> <br>      Wynddane<br>Posted On 06/26/01 12:06PM <br><br><br>:::The Cleric watches a friend....an old friend....a friend that has been his from the moment he stepped onto Norrath go into a frenzied rage....he has never seen him likw this before.....Lost.....Confused....he watched Desperate rip down most of the pictures of the officers he chose....watched him move into the throne room where sylver once sat and ruled over Dane.

His emotions still so bright burning out of control inside. Wynddane was able to approach him without his realization. When his long time friend and advisor finally spoke Desperate flung into action startled.~<br><br>~Spinning around Desperate reached for his axe, forgetting it still hung in his doorway. His eyes locked on Wynddane's a moment too late as a clenched fist slammed into the side of his brother's head. Desperate tried to pull back the ill-fated punch but to no avail. He recoiled as Wynddane stumbled back a few steps.~<br><br>"I...Wynd.." ~The words refused to leave his lips whatever they would have been. The fury built inside from the fall of an empire exploded once again as Desperate ripped the chair from the ground that stood at the head of the table. Sylverdane had sat there, then Myssi, then reserved for Fuduce and finally himself. With all the strength he could muster the warrior heaved the chair. It sailed over the still blazing inferno and exploded into the wall on the far side of the great hall.~<br><br>~Desperate's hand still bleed from the sacrificial dagger, as he clenched his fist pain seered up his arm and clouded his mind. Once, twice, three times Desperate slammed his bloodied fist into the table, staining the end red with his blood. Blood that he had spilled along side so many great men and women. So many brother's and sisters, friends and family.~<br><br>"Brother!" ~Desperate's eye met Wynddane's bewildered gaze.~ "You silently sit, clensing the souls in the City of Myst. Have you been blinded by the dirt that has clung to our souls here at home? You house falls around you, and you say you are content." ~Desperate's hand flung towards the portrait of Sylverdane and his wife, blood arched painting over the picture as he pointed.~ "Your brother started this Guild, he turned it into a Family. And now it is not the name of the guild that is mocked. It is your name. It is his name." ~Desperate spit out the last few words. The body pait that covered his chest and face was mixing with his wounds. His shoulder, his chest, his hand, the paint's toxins were designed to heighten the berserker rage.~ "And you are content."<br><br>~Crossing the room Desperate flip the blazing paintings off the table and onto the floor. Wynddane seemed stunned either by the blow Desperate had dilevered, the harsh words that flew from his mouth like poison from Necromancer's spell. Or all of the above, the fire, the ruined halls, the anger. Still crossing the hall to the far wall Desperate continued his tyrate.~<br><br>"Tell me brother, what do you see when you look around? Who's faces? Who's names?" ~Desperate spun quickly to face Wynddane from halfway acrossed the room~ "Do you know the people you call brother's and sister's any longer? What is Dane now?"<br><br><br><br>Deep Thoughts From a Shallow Mind<br>--Desperate Measures<br>Guild Leader of<br>The Hand Of Dane<br><br><br><br> <br>  <br><br> RE: Furry builds itself, and not much else <br><br> <br>      DesperateMeasur<br>Posted On 06/26/01 06:07PM <br><br><br>~Unaware of when Solux had entered the hall, or what his presence met, Desperate looked over his returned brother. It did his heart good to see him, but the anger still burned brighter then any light that remained lit in the Manor.~<br><br>"Solux, you and I have crossed words on more then one occassion, if you want your return celebrated as a happy one, don't bring it here."<br><br>~Standing dripping with sweat and blood, halfway between Wynd and Solux the warrior stood both as a man who had just fought a terrible battle, and a man ready to wage war on the world.~<br><br>~Turning his attention from Solux back to Wynddane, Desperate found his tongue once more.~ "Where are your brother's now? Where is Sylver, River, Thunderr, Stone, Fyre, Hip, Hippy, Lleu, Clever, Pagan? Make a plavar with your family.

It is not laughter of humor, or amusement, but pain and torment. When you hurt you continue, and as the pain builds you slow. Until the breaking point. When you crumple under the weight of your own deamons. When you can not scream, when you can not cry, when you know only of the pain inside, you and others, when you feel completely powerless to stop it. It is then you embrace the pain, laugh at it. The breaking point, where the waves hit the rocks and either return to the sea defeated or break down the mountain.~<br><br>"Aye brother, challange me, and leave. That is after all what us Danes are known for is it not? Fighting amongst ourselves? You call me a barbarian, and proudly so I am. I am a man of action and not words. I have been with Dane from Day one, just as you. And yet you have left and I have stayed."<br><br>~Desperate stood at the end of the granite table and strained with all his might. The cut on his hand screamed, and still he strained. His muslces bared to the limits lifting up. A vein slithered its way up the warrior's neck as every ounce of barbaric strength surged through his arms...The Breaking point...somthing had to give....<br><br>...when Begotten attacked somthing gave...<br>...When Myssi sacrificed herself for the family somthing gave...<br>...When Adaley fell at the hands of the Family of Peace war somthing gave...<br>..When Taja betrayed the family somthing gave...<br>...When Equinoxe challanged Sylverdane somthing gave...<br>...When Wynddane left somthing gave...<br>...When Rudra left somthing gave...<br>...Dia...<br>...Myssi...<br>...Sylverdane...<br>...Fuduce...<br>...Pepie...<br>...Desdmonda...<br>...Rollo...<br>...Starweaver...<br>...Emause...<br>...Shandar...<br>...Staley...<br>...Dreamwork...<br>...Inen...<br>...Haidit...<br>...Ilaenu...<br>...Tryzen...<br>...Mukta...<br>...Multar...<br>...Secil...<br>...Lupher...<br>...Darkdane...<br>...Brilhasti...<br>...Alchemey...<br>...Riverdane...<br>...Shadowdame...<br>...Talonious...<br>...Thunderrdane...<br>...Pepie...<br>...Zinta...<br>...Violeteyes...<br>...Duss...<br><br>...somthing gave...<br>...someone gave, but what was left to give?...<br>...The warrior grunted and strained under the weight of the table and Norrath...<br>...Somthing had to give...<br><br>~CRACK~<br><br>~Somthing gave~ <br><br>Deep Thoughts From a Shallow Mind<br>--Desperate Measures<br>Guild Leader of<br>The Hand Of Dane<br><br><br><br><br> <br>  <br><br> What Gives <br><br> <br>      DesperateMeasur<br>Posted On 06/26/01 09:41PM <br><br><br>~Straining under the the table, all his might lifting at one end, all the weight holding down the other. Sweat poured down the Warrior, his muscles grew tighter and tigher. His calfs bulged, his arms strained, his teeth clenched. The table released its grip on the ground.~<br><br>~Smoke from the still blazing inferno swirled like ghosts dancing around the room, wrapping their tendrils around Desperate's body, then continued to slither around the room.~<br><br>~CRACK~<br><br>~Desperate Collapsed, the darkness swam around him, embracing him, then enveloped him.~<br><br>"Funny how things happen. One minute you're happily walking along, and the next a Wolly Mammoth sits on you."<br><br>~Desperate opened his eyes and glanced around. A pillar of light surrounded him, and darkness surrounded the light. He recogonized this place, and the voice from his dreams.~ "I've forsaken you, leave me be." ~Desperate's voice was weary, exhausted.~<br><br>"Forsaken? What does that mean exactly?"<br><br>"I NO LONGER WORSHIP YOU. NO LEAVE ME!" ~Desperate found some bass in his voice as he shouted.~<br><br>"You no longer worship me?" ~The voice laughed. In the music of laughter can be found birds and children, song by instrument and voice, but in this laughter was a blended mix of anger, dispare, apathay, and hatred. Desperate's skin crawled~<br><br>"I've never worshiped you, and I still talk with you."<br><br>~Desperate pushed against the floor, climing the air to his feet. He tried to establish where the voice was comming from so he could look the darkness in the eye.~ "As is your problem. You never shut up, and you never listen."<br><br>~Silence~<br><br>~Desperate reached a hand into the darkness and it vanished at the elbow. He withdrew it whole. The darkness and the silence grew weight, weight that leaned down on Desperate from above. He suddenly felt like he was about to be crushed from somthing from above. Refusing to look up the warrior continued his tyrate.~<br><br>"Too many people are saying the guild is over. The family is saying the end is here. They fight and bicker, they stab each other in the back. They turn cold to their brothers and sister's requests. Everyone tells me the cost is too high. They give and give to the family and yet not one will look around and see what they have in each other."<br><br>~Silence. Rushing doom from above.~<br><br>"I can't make them help each other. I can't make them build the manor they tore down. They yell, but they don't listen. The family is too small, the family is too big. Recruit, close the doors, remove this person bring in that person. Attack this guild, sacrifice to that one. Come help me, leave me alone."<br><br>~The feeling was growing inside, rushing doom from above, a tidal wave, a meteor falling. Somthing, somthing huge about to crash down.~<br><br>~Silence~<br><br>"Have you nothing to say now?" ~Desperate swirled in the light looking on all sides for the voice. Through the silence, through the darkness. It was almost atop him now.~<br><br>"With everyone who leaves, someone follows. Every example that is set, someone believes. Anything that is done or not done drives them away."<br><br>~Desperate closed his eyes. Refusing to wait for the oncomming assult from above. He could feel it like a fire now. Burning, hotter then the lavastorm mountains. Desperate stepped into the darkness out of the light.

He tilted it trying to flip it over when the center snapped. Somthing gave.~<br><br>~Like a ruberband pulled to tight the table snapped. Half of it landing on the pile of burning portraits, the other half in Desperate's hands. The weight was now undistributed. Resting soley against the Warrior. He staggered a step, his knee buckled and he collapsed under it's weight.~<br><br>~The brunt of the table slammed into his chest with a crash that echoed through the manor.

Topa mumbled "Hey bro Granite is hard." Not quite as furious as his brother the rogue was still upset to see his home infested with what seemed to be "new ways" &amp; the thinking of "newcomers". It has been said that in order for the Hand of Dane to survive it must let go of the old ways &amp; embrace a new set of values, values that seem geared towards loot &amp; raids &amp; less about fellowship &amp; brotherhood. Topa believed that if dane no longer serves the purpose it orriginally intended then it should end &amp; allow the "new ways" to spawn it's own creation. As dess slowly regined conciousness he could here Topa say...."Sometimes the only way to get rid of the rats is to burn down the house". when Des finaly awoke Topa was no where to be seen, but as a typical rogue that did not mean he wasn't there, Just that Des couldn't see him.:: <br><br>~Topasere~<br>~To steal from the rich &amp; give to the poor means to be poor &amp; steal untill you become Rich!!~<br><br><br><br><br><br> <br>  <br><br> Out of the Darkness..a Dia returns! <br><br> <br>      Diaa<br>Posted On 06/27/01 04:24AM <br><br><br>...<br><br>Night has fallen as a lone figure aproaches.The creak of well used battle leather blends &amp; mixes with the incessant mumbling of the half-elf."..so..we must remember to use three pounds of gnome..of course!..silly dia.." the strange traveler is heard muttering to himself.<br><br>Upon the entrance of Dane Manor,the sign hangs broken &amp; abused.Noticing this,Diadane Mirrorkin looks puzzled.<br>"Dear Gawd!..what did this..gnomes!..it must have been!..or was it..halflins!?..yes..yes..I can see it now.."curses the Paladin as he brandishes his sword.Walking in a fighter's crouch,Diadane enters the dwelling.What he sees therein,freezes our Insane Hero still.<br><br><br>"What the?!."

Faces of friends, people who had left and people who had returned. The sence of the surreal made it difficult to tell what was happening and what was real. As the voices danced around the room, like a drunken bard missing every other word. Desperate tried to sit up and clear his mind. Diadane stood over him screaming somthing. Solux sat smoking a pipe as though all the answers rested in the swirling smoke it emmited. He could sence others, though he couldn't see them.~<br><br>~Desperate's one eye floated around the room. Unable to focus on any one thing, so instead danced over everything. Every breath he took hurt down deep inside, though he couldn't figure out why. When he looked down his bared chest, a gash, his war paint and a huge bruise swirled in an indisernable but deliberate pattern.~<br><br>~Crack~<br><br>~Desperate's ears were ringing. They world had been put on mute. Desperate brought his hands over his ears, the ringing grew louder. The world swam out of focus, and the barbarian fell to his knees. He screamed. The heal spell casted by the paladin had helped his body, but his mind was left realing. His scream seemed to go on forever. He couldn't hear it. Only that terrible ringing.~<br><br>~It is said when your ears ring, someone is talking about you. It occured that everyone must be talking about thier guild leader. Memories of the destruction of his room flashed in his mind. Every portrait torn from the wall. The fire, the axe, Wynddane, Rhyden.~<br><br>"He's lost it...."<br>..."Completely off his rocker..."<br>..."He's never been all there..."<br>..."crazy"...<br>..."crazy"...<br>..."crazy"...<br><br>"I'm not crazy!" ~Desperate muttered. Though who it was directed to was unknown. Obviously to Dia as well. The palidin put his face inches from Desperate's.<br><br>"WHAT?" ~Dia yelled~<br><br>"lost it..." ~Desperate trailed off~<br><br>"DON'T WORRY WE'LL FIND IT!" ~Dia responded looking confused. Still screaming, apparently to make up for the lack of volume that Desperate used. To those around him Dia shouted, "Don't just stand there, Desperate's lost it. Look, help him find it." ~The half-elf shruged to tell the other's he had no clue what either Desperate or himself was talking about.~<br><br>"I...haven't lost it." ~Desperate said with more force. Trying to reassure either himself or those around him that he wasn't crazy.~<br><br>"OH NEVERMIND HE FOUND IT." ~Dia shouted to the manor.~<br><br>~Desperate put an arm around Diadane, his huge arms engulfing the palidin's head. The smaller man had more strength then would have been guessed and helped up his leader with ease.~<br><br>"GET OUT OF THE WAY. MOVE IT OR LOOSE IT. COMMING THROUGH" ~Dia shouted though no one blocked their path. Desperate tightened his grip choking his friend just enough to silence him.~<br><br>"I'm not deaf yet." ~Desperate said, finding his strength returning.~ "I need to sit and rest." <br><br>Deep Thoughts From a Shallow Mind<br>--Desperate Measures<br>Guild Leader of<br>The Hand Of Dane<br><br><br><br> <br>  <br><br> The battle continues <br><br> <br>      DesperateMeasur<br>Posted On 06/27/01 05:03PM <br><br><br>~Desperate leaned against the wall, his sences returning slowly. The officer's hall was in shambles. He dreaded returning to his office, or his quarters. He just wanted to relax. To take some time and vanish. Somplace where no one depended on him. Somewhere that he could screw up his life, and no one elses. So much road on his shoulders. But there was never time for that. No rest for the weary.~<br><br>~The bards were apparently still busy with their work. Lleudane ran into the offier's hall drums banging. Desperate had a desire to turn those drums into kindling, or anything quieter. Without a word he handed Desperate a message and continued on his rounds. Taking note of the condition of the manor.~<br><br>~It Read~<br><br>--Dia has returned.--<br>--Wynddane has begun a search for your replacement--<br>--Rhyden hasn't taken well with his removal from HoD--<br>--Speaking through Kvyn he has voiced his displeasure with the guild--<br>--Kvyn should be considered for removal to prevent Rhyden from further access to the Guild--<br>--Knights Errant has ironed out their problems and is Doing better--<br>--Basylysk has left the guild--<br>--Topasere started a bar fight in High Pass--<br><br>~Desperate's head already begun to pound once again as he read the latest news. He was not looking forward to the conversation that he would have to have with Kvyn. Or Wynddane. He could feel his brother's presence, reading over his shoulder no doubt. He thought he heard an unmistakable laughter of pride when he read his name. He had been following the goings on with Knights Errant ever since his daughter joined thier ranks.~<br><br>~Scribbling quickly Desperate sent word back with Lleudane and set up a meeting with several people at the earliest convience~ <br><br>Deep Thoughts From a Shallow Mind<br>--Desperate Measures<br>Guild Leader of<br>The Hand Of Dane<br><br><br><br><br><br> <br>  <br><br> RE: The battle continues <br><br> <br>      DesperateMeasur<br>Posted On 06/27/01 05:17PM <br><br><br>~The first meeting was set for that night. Desperate's office had been put together with haste. It still lay in shambles. He was dressed in full cloth. Taking a break from his endless training. That and he needed to repair his armor.~<br><br>~When Kvyn entered Desperate's office he paid no notice to the destruction in the office.~<br><br>"We need to talk brother." ~Desperate said, getting straight to the point. Kvyn was never one for dancing around the subject.~<br><br>"Long time no see old friend." ~Kvyn let his eyes drift briefly around the office~<br><br>"I'm sure you've heard from Rhyden's departure from the family."<br><br>~Kvyn only nodded~<br><br>"I'm further assuming you heard of Lisandra's removal due to the actions on Rhyden's part?"<br><br>"Blah, blah, blah. Yeah somthing like that." ~Kvyn briefly reminded Desperate of Salamandar. A man who has a commanding presence, and demands authority. And yet has an almost utter distaste for authority. It was a unique blend.~<br><br>"Are you aware, that Rhyden has taken action on your part as well?" ~Kvyn's silence told Desperate that he was unaware. Or uncaring. It was hard to tell.~ "Through you, Rhyden bad mouthed me and another Dane."<br><br>"blah, blah, blah. Yeah I see where this is going." ~Kvyn removed his colors. Dane's colors and dropped them on Desperate's recently repaired desk.~<br><br>"That wasn't where I was going. But mayhaps Dane has been going there for a long time." ~Desperate said never removing his eye from his friend, and now former brother. I've just lost a good man, and a damned good officer Desperate thought.~<br><br>"I hope you all rebuild dane to its previous glory. But to me Dane has been dead a long time and alaways will be." ~Kvyn's spoke with apathey, but also with a remorse for things lost in the past.~<br><br>~Raldan, or Raidan, Desperate could never tell the two apart, walked by, saw Kvyn's colors, and only muttered with a sigh a word of good-bye.~<br><br>"Do me a favor, Kvyn." ~Desperate waited.~<br><br>"Probably, but I have to hear it first." ~Kvyn said with a smirk.~<br><br>"Talk to your boy Rhyden. If Dane is going to die, it will die, but I don't want him trying to deliver the finishing blow. Whatever is between him and I, or was is no more. He won't listen to me. But might to you. I just don't want to have to have this same conversation with Solux or Sweetlovens." <br><br>~Memories flashed in his mind, hunting with Sweets in High Hold so long ago, when Sylver still stood at the helm. The talks he had with Solux. He was a good guy. Desperate made a note to hunt with Solux, he was a good guy and didn't get the welcome home he deserved~<br><br>"No problem. I'll talk to him" ~With that Kvyn walked out of the manor, Desperate wondered who would follow him. He sat quietly in his office staring out the still broken window and watched the stars for a spell.~<br><br>"Where are you Sylver?" ~Desperate trailed off. <br><br>Deep Thoughts From a Shallow Mind<br>--Desperate Measures<br>Guild Leader of<br>The Hand Of Dane<br><br><br>Message Edited on 06/27/01 05:21PM by DesperateMeasur  <br>  <br><br> Old Friends Passed <br><br> <br>      DesperateMeasur<br>Posted On 06/27/01 06:46PM <br><br><br>~Desperate sat staring out the window letting the cool breeze wash over him for a long while. He did not look forward to the comming conversation. It would be a difficult one. The warrior took a deep breath and left his office to find Rhyden.~<br><br>~He had attempted to locate Rhyden through his usual ways, but the lines had been crossed and Rhyden was no where to be found. Desperate finally caught up with him in Greater Faydark.~<br><br>"Rhyden!" ~Desperate alot harsher then he intended the built up stress was taking its tole.~<br><br>~Rhyden turned but remained silent.~<br><br>"Kvyn is no longer with Dane." ~Desperate stood silent before his old friend. Letting everything sink in.~<br><br>"What the phuk? Why?" ~Rhyden responded quickly. Maybe too quickly. He had a hint of fore knowledge in his voice. He was not suprised.~<br><br>"Because of comments you made through him. Verbally attacking more then one Dane." ~Desperate tried to rein in his emotion.~<br><br>"Who?" ~Rhyden was fishing. Trying to figure out exactly how much Desperate knew.~<br><br>"Me for one." ~Desperate wasn't going to play his game. Only say what he came to say.~<br><br>"Then why don't you remove Wynddane? He came to me when he thought I was Kvyn. And said you had gone looney and needed to be replaced as leader." <br><br>~Desperate knew Wynd had made comment about replacing Desperate and even had begun searching for people to back him. But he wasn't aware that Wynd had gone after his officers so soon. Would Stonedane back Wynd or Desperate? The questions lingered in his mind too long. Druuni wouldn't support Desperate or Wynddane, the druid always did what was in the best interest of the guild. His trust in her never faltered. Despearte needed to say somthing to Rhyden. Stonlor had increasing doubts in Dane, who's side would he take? The silence hung in the air. Grimace? Who else?~<br><br>"Wynddane didn't hide behind another person. He came outright as himself. I respect that. I will deal with Wynddane's King Baiting on my terms."<br><br>"That is Bullshyt, when he said you had gone crazy, I defended you and you are saying that I'm attacking you." ~Rhyden was going to push this button until Desperate cracked. Until he knew the effect it had on his friend.~<br><br>"That is somthing else. You need to stay away from Dane. Contrary to popular belief Dane isn't a group of people looking for another guild. We are a guild, we are a family. And I will not stand for using Dane to recruit for True Alliance." ~Desperate was shouting. The rage was controled. Not like before. He still saw Rhyden as a kid. Someone he had taken in and helped. Someone he had looked after. But he didn't kid himself. Rhyden had developed his skills quickly. He was a powerful warrior. Desperate taught him alot. But Rhyden had learned tricks of his own. He didn't care to figure out who would emerge victorious in a battle between them.~<br><br>~Rhyden staggered back. The force in Desperate's voice shook him a little. Caused him to pause.~ "I only spoke with people who were talking about leaving."<br><br>"I don't care. If Dane dies, it will die. If someone leaves Dane you can pick them up. But until then STAY AWAY FROM MY FAMILY." ~Desperate spat out the final words~<br><br>"I don't know who's telling you I'm talking shyt behind your back." ~Rhyden was trying to regain control of the conversation. Reverting back to a subject that Desperate didn't have all the facts on.~<br><br>"When you tell someone to leave Dane that is an attack on me." ~Desperate was making a gamble. A stab in the dark as to what Rhyden might have said. Implying that somthing was taken out of context. To say that he was still wrong, but not deliberatly.~ "When you attack Dane you insult alot of people. And by recruiting from within our ranks that is an attack."<br><br>"Well you removed me. Without knowing everything. Without talking to me. You just kicked me." ~Rhyden was getting to the problem. Desperate challanging him apparently hit Rhyden like a physical assult. Desperate wanted to say it was one of the hardest things he had done. But he couldn't. This had to be resolved.~<br><br>"BULLSHYT! You self removed." ~In truth Desperate was glad he had. Action needed to be taken towards Rhyden, and Desperate wasn't sure if he could remove his long time friend.~<br><br>"Because you told me to." ~Desperate wondered if Rhyden really believed Desperate wanted him out. It was just somthing that had to be done. A sacrifice for the family. Like so many before it.~<br><br>"Wrong. After you threatened Agressor I told you that You should be removed for that." Not that I was going to." ~In truth Desperate didn't know if he could have removed his friend.~<br><br>"Lisan..." ~Rhyden didn't even finish her name before Desperate knew where he was going.~<br><br>"I removed Lisandra because you were going to use her to kill a Black Claw. I'm not getting into this shyt again." ~Desperate's furry flared again.~<br><br>"I was sitting down talking to Salamandar when you removed her without a word."<br><br>"You said the only reason you were getting her was to kill a Black Claw. I couldn't stop you. But I could stop a Dane from attacking a Claw."<br><br>~Desperate took a deep breath. He swallowed his anger. This was not the place for it. Not the place for blame. Not the place for Anger. This was a place to end things~<br><br>~Desperate Continued~ "Rhyden I don't trust you. I dont' trust your priorities, I dont' trust your loyalities. I don't know what you are going to do any more. I want you to stay away from Dane. Let whatever happens happen."<br><br>~The arguement took as large a toll on Rhyden as it had on Desperate. The two men only stared at each other in silence. It could have gone either way. They were either on the brink of an understanding or a battle. The waves hit the rocks and either return to the sea, or break down the mountain.~<br><br>~Rhyden nodded.~<br><br>~Desperate turned. He still had alot to do. And would have more. There was always more to do.~ <br><br>Deep Thoughts From a Shallow Mind<br>--Desperate Measures<br>Guild Leader of<br>The Hand Of Dane<br><br><br><br><br><br> <br>  <br><br> RE: Old Friends Passed <br><br> <br>      Desdmona<br>Posted On 06/28/01 12:42PM <br><br><br>~Desdmona sits in her comfortable room she and her husband Aerimus have taken. When there is a pounding at the door...."LET ME IN I SAY... I have urgent business to discuss with you!" Looking around she retrieves her picks to let this person in. A look of anger flashes as she remembers she hasnt the skill to open the door. Agnrily she shakes Aerimus. "Wake Up !! Someone has come to our door demanding to see me......open the door so I might know of his messages." <br>~ Aerimus growls....."What another message from your fallen guild??"<br>~ Desdmona glares at him. "Dont you ever speak of them like that again!!" *Thinking she might actually fight with her mate over this.* " We have had this discussion before. Desperate is my adopted father and I will not have you speak ill of him nor my family. I left them to cleave to you as it should be because we are married. They are still part of me and will be as long as I breathe!"<br>~ Shaking she allows the messenger to deliver his news. It is brief and he reads it quickly studdering....... "Your uhhh your umm...... Desperate has fallen mad. He has destroyed the Halls of Dane. There is talk of the family replacing him. Rhyden has left and many changes have taken place since you went out questing."<br>~ Desdmona snatches the message from him and shoves him out the door. Tearfull, looking at the tattered note she sees the familiar scrawl of a fellow Rogue.<br>"Topa......she wispers," dressing quickly and packing her bags. " I must go to him, my husband, he is my only father and the only other man save for you in my life. If you love me as you say you do then you will let me.... now open the door."<br>~ Aerimus reaches to hug and plactae as Desdmona snatches his prized dagger from his pack. " I will be needing this. It is a dangerous trip. NOW OPEN THE DOOR!"<br>~ Hugging and kissing his wife fiercly, Aerumis opens the door. "How many times must you run to them?? You cant save those bent on self destruction!! I Love you my wife, please be carefull."<br>~Desdmona calls back over her shoulder,"I will."

Sitting, head in hands, under a tree in Greater Faydark.<br>~ Kneeling before the man she calls her father she cant help but to cry. Seeing his face contorted with fury and pain. Noticing the half healed wounds in his shoulder and chest she takes his hands in hers. Grimicing as her fingers touch the slash across his palm.<br>"What has happend? The messinger said you went mad? You destroyed the Manor? What in the the name of the Gods has happened to you?"<br>" Father you cant use anger to make them see the true path. I know your in pain, you ache and are weary. Each must see the true path to glory isnt in the raids or items, but in kinship and honor. The conclusion must be reached in their hearts, you can not instill this in them."<br>~Desdmona offers Desperate some of his favorate drink, frozen toe rum. Whipeing the sweat from his brow embraces him.<br>~"It is hard....seeing all the greed in our world. Watching those who have nothing but bitterness in their hearts gain experience and glorious new wepons and armor. I too have felt this pain, the jelousy and anger knowing I should have such things too. Having to watch those who are so undeserving take their pleasures and spoils. While the pure of heart must get by on meager offerings of the Gods. It is spiritbreaking and can consume a person it they let it. I truely believe that is where the problem with Dane lies. It isnt the lack of kinship, it is anger festering out of longing. Jelousy of watching those who deserve get only the seconds. Those feelings breed contempt even with in our own family. They cause rivalries and arguments."<br>~ Sitting down beside her father Desdmona sighs. " I dont know how to help you. My heart aches. Noone respects me anymore as I have gone from the halls. My name has not been spoken with respect in a long time.....I am an outcast now.<br>~ Sobbing softly as she sips her rum. " I dont know what to do!! How to help you!! I shed a silent tear everytime I hear news of events happening. It is causing problem in my marriage as I am torn between the two men I love and respect the most. Aerimus isnt unfeeling, he knows of the situation. He has his own duties to his family and constantly reminds me of mine. I exist in torment. I aid my new family and long to aid my Danes too.<br>I can only offer you my words and what I have learned. it is up to you, Father to lead them back. To demonstrate that the true path to glory isnt items or experience, but kinship and honor. I cant tell you how to do this, as it was a hard lesson for me to learn myself.<br>~ Laying her head on Desperate's shoulder she looks at the man who took her as his own against all conflicts of race and hatered. <br>~With tears in her eyes she vows she will stand beside him come what may.<br>Choking Desdmona wispers, " I Love You Father, I always will. We will survive this. I do not know if Dane will, but you, me and Topa will pick up what pieces we need to and go on......as always."<br><br>Desdmona Shadowborn<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Message Edited on 06/28/01 01:36PM by Desdmona  <br>  <br><br> RE: Healing Wounds <br><br> <br>      Grimance<br>Posted On 06/28/01 03:19PM <br><br><br>**grimance sits in silence inside Dane Manor.**<br>**Just listening for the right moment**<br><br>Desperate bleeds, I bleed.<br><br><br><br> <br>  <br><br> An Idea <br><br> <br>      DesperateMeasur<br>Posted On 06/28/01 03:56PM <br><br><br>~Desperate sat in Greater Faydark, silently listneing to Desdmona. The bottle remained undrank in his hands as she spoke to him. The path she had choosen lead her out the door of the manor, and to her husband. Her visits were rare nowadays, though casually she and Desperate spoke often. He wanted to chuckle when she said she heard he had gone mad. You make one little fire and everyone's ready to commit you.~<br><br>~Finally taking a long pull from northern brew she had given him Desperate let it wash his mind. Moving his eye to her he spoke softly.~<br><br>"Little one, in this world I have always been crazy. It isn't a new thing. Bringing family and friends together in the midsts of all this hate is crazy. Those of us that believe in Dane. Believe so feircely that it is hard to see the right path."<br><br>~Desperate still had much to do, and couldn't afford the time to sit in the mist of the elves all day. He climbed to his feet. A slight blur from the alcohol entered his mind, but nothing serious.~<br><br>~The warrior laid his huge hand on the rogue's shouler.~ "Little one, never doubt. The world turns everyday. When our conversation is over you will go back to your husband, wrap his arms around you and feel safe once again. The turmoil that stirs around us only lasts a while as does the pleasure. You are happy with your husband, enjoy with everything you have, because Happiness is so fleeting. I will be here for you whenever you need me."<br><br>~Desperate signed, and was crushed under its weight. His back hunched a little, and his head turned to the ground. Deep in thought and deep in dispair he tried to think of his next move. To Desdmona he finished.~ "Dane will always be here, because Dane was never Sylverdane, Dane was never Hand of Dane, Dane is somthing that touched so many people and they will always walk around with it. Dane will effect thier judgement. Even now, everything that has been learned in those hallowed halls of Dane Manor is pulling at everyone. Dane will never die, because it isn't a man, and it isn't a guild. It is an idea that is burned in us all."<br><br>~Desperate's voice trailed out and he walked into the mist vanishing.~ <br><br>Deep Thoughts From a Shallow Mind<br>--Desperate Measures<br>Guild Leader of<br>The Hand Of Dane<br><br><br><br><br><br> <br>  <br><br> RE: Anger destroys everything until it is all that is left <br><br> <br>      Wynddane<br>Posted On 06/28/01 06:55PM <br><br><br>:::The Cleric sits and looks out to the ocean....not hunting .....not talking....he just looks as if he is staring into nothingness.

His heavey steps crossed the small continent and when his eye finally glanced up to see where he was. The warrior stood at the docks in Butcherblocks Mountains. To his left the shuttle to Kunark, to his right the ship that would take him to Freeport.~<br><br>~Left, right, left right, Kunark, Antonica, Fironia Vie, Freeport, left right. Desperate had no clue where he had been going or how long he had been wandering.~<br><br>"Not all who wander are lost" ~Desperate found himself muttering a verse his brother was found of saying. The warrior wondered, had he not looked up here where he would have found himself. His mind was so flooded with thoughts, abstract and broken that it was hard to focus on any one thing. So much had gone wrong over the past few months and not much had gone right. He kept seeing the same faces in the Dane manor, and those were not the ones he was upset with. It was the ones that left, the ones that never went. Where was he going? Desperate silently recited a verse he had learned in his childhood in Everfrost from the wolves.~<br><br>On the road that I have taken,<br>one day, walking, I awaken,<br>amazed to see where I have come,<br>where I'm going, and where I'm from.<br><br>This is not the path I thought.<br>This is not the place I sought.<br>This is not the dream I bought,<br>just a fever of fate I've caught.<br><br>I'll change Highways in a while,<br>at the crossroads, one more mile.<br>My path is lit by my own fire.<br>i'm going only where I desire.<br><br>On the road that I have taken,<br>one day, walking, I awaken.<br>One day, walking I awaken,<br>on the road that I have taken.<br><br><br>Deep Thoughts From a Shallow Mind<br>--Desperate Measures<br>Guild Leader of<br>The Hand Of Dane<br><br><br><br><br><br> <br>  <br><br> Crossroads <br><br> <br>      Lluedane<br>Posted On 06/29/01 03:49AM <br><br><br>::In the shadows walking slowly behind the bewildered leader of Hand of Dane a bard whistled a silent song. Follong him in the concealment of his musical notes.:: Where in the hell was Desperate going? I've been following him for hours. Up one hill down another, through the lake, and around a cornor. ::Questions flashed through Lleu's mind. He had been following his leader since he left the Manor. Things were definatly not right. So lost in his own thoughts the bard almost tripped over Desperate at the docks in Butchblock.:: Now what? ::Desperate just stood there, looking from left to right muttering about being lost to himself.:: This was accomplishing nothing. ::Lleu listened to the verse Desperate recited and made his presence noted.::<br><br>On the road that I have taken,<br>one day, walking, I awaken,<br>amazed to se where I have come,<br>where I'm going, and where I'm from.<br><br>This is not the path I thought.<br>This is not the place I sought.<br>This is not hte dream I bought,<br>just a fever of fate I've caught.<br><br>I'll change Highways in a while,<br>at the crossroads, one more mile.<br>My path is lit by my own fire.<br>I'm going only wher eI desire.<br><br>On the road that I have taken,<br>one day, walking, I awaken.<br>One day, walking, I awaken,<br>on the road that I have taken.<br><br>"No actually wer are standing at the docks." ::The barbarian, a race not exactly known for its intelligence. After all Everfrost had no roads. Even the stupid ogres knew how to make roads, anyway, the barbarian looked confused by Llue's comment. Speaking exageratedly slow Llue tried to explain:: "These are the bucherblock docks. The crossroads are behind us." ::Llue turned and pointed down the road.::<br><br>::Desperate shook his head no:: "Yes, the crossroads are behind us." ::Lluedane shook his head yes.::<br><br>"That isn't what I mean. It is an old poem. I figured a bard to know a thing about hat." ::Desperate said obviously growing irritated by the conversation.::<br><br>"The book of counted sorrows? No, what's that." ::The bard mocked in return.::<br><br>"We can still embrace love,<br>it's not too late.<br>So why do we instead,<br>sleep with hate?<br><br>Belief requires no suspension,<br>to see that hell is our invention,<br>we make hell real,<br>we stroke its fires,<br>and in its flames,<br>our hope expires." <br> <br>

RE: Crossroads <br><br> <br>      DesperateMeasur<br>Posted On 06/29/01 04:04AM <br><br><br>~Llue, the youngest of all Danes, Well him and his brother Pagan, always got on Desperate's nerves quick. He was much like the prince born at the height of an empire. A silver spoon in his mouth with no sence of reality. Desperate had thought on more then one occassion of beating responsibility into the bard with that perverbial spoon. But this time somthing he had said actually made sence. The bard made vague refferences to poems and tails but Desperate turned him off. Focusing instead on what he had said.~<br><br>"The crossroads are behind us." ~I'll change highways in a while, at the crossroads, one more mile. The answer he was seeking. Burried in the verse.~<br><br>~Lleu was reciting somthing else when Desperate cut him off, his voice sharp as a razor.~ "Llue shut up for a minute." ~The bard obeyed. Though more out of shock then obediance.~ "Gather all the Danes you can find. Have them meet at the Butcherblock Crossroads. I'll wait for them there. I want all Danes there."<br><br>"You want me to talk to EVERY dane?" ~Llue's sarcasm was apparent even before he finished.~ "You mean all 5 of us?" ~Had desperate seen a spoon he would have seen what Llue really looked with a spoon in his mouth, or down his throat.~ "That could take an hour!"<br><br>"Llue so help me, you spoiled little shyt. If you don't I'll let Topasere loose on you." ~Topasere was not half as diplomatic as his brother and had no difficulties fufilling any thought that crossed his mind. Needless to say the two didn't get along.~ "I want you to invite all Danes. Past and present. We will decide what is to be done now.<br><br>~Llue silently nodded and boarded the ship to Freeport.~ <br><br>Deep Thoughts From a Shallow Mind<br>--Desperate Measures<br>Guild Leader of<br>The Hand Of Dane<br><br><br><br>width="388" height="154"&gt;<br><br><br><br><br> <br>  <br><br> RE: Crossroads <br><br> <br>      DesperateMeasur<br>Posted On 06/29/01 04:31AM <br><br><br>((OOC:))Slipping out of character for a moment let me first say. Thank you to everyone who has participated in his story line. The work here has been excellent. Just like the characters in a book you've all shown somthing about your characters and yourselves.<br><br>Grimance's patience and steadfast loyality to me and to Dane.<br><br>Solux tokin' on his pipe like Bilbo Baggins.<br><br>Topasere's sometimes dark humor, and rogueish manner.<br><br>Desdmona's split between the two guilds<br><br>Wynddane's and my rocky past and our supsequent personality change overs.<br><br>Dia's ...uh....psychotic behavior. And yes he's always like that<br><br>The problems between Rhyden and I<br><br>Kvyn's easy acceptance of everything. He's always struck me as a guy you could tell anything to and he would only nod and continue unfazed with life. "Huge 3 headed Aliens just landed in my back yard." -- "Uh huh, damn I need a beer."<br><br>When you participate in a story line, even slightly you let people get to know you who otherwise wouldn't get the chance. Either because of different time's on-line, or level restraints or hunting paterns. Using the Mythical Dane manor as a meeting place for everyone gets us all together in one place, for one purpose to meet and get to know one another. You don't have to worry about zones, you don't have to worry about mobs or Pks, tell hell, or sudden cliffs like High Hold (Which I seem to have to fall off of once a month). <br><br>I wanted to use this Thread/Story Line to get as many people's attention as I possibly could. The meeting mentioned at the crossroads is going to take place.<br><br>However I've tried on many occassions to get everyone in guild on and at a meeting several times. It never works. RL gets in the way and I end up talking to one or two peole which I can do, and do do in E-mails.<br><br>So I'm going to keep this thread alive and I want everyone to post thier ideas and thoughts on Dane. There are alot of ideas floating around, now we need to focus them. And decide what is happening and what is going to happen.<br><br>There are alot of influences to Dane from people that are no longer with us. So many times people have said that they will always be Dane. I want this to be opened to them as well.<br><br>Finally, I'm long winded, yes I know. I am a writer when I'm writing in character I turn it into a story. I think it makes things more interesting and funner to read. If not to read, at least to write. I use " ~ ~ " for emotes, and quotations for speach. Its a good way to put in observations and sparatic thoughts (which I am full of). I'm always in Character and contrary to popular belief you do not need to talk with thee's and thou's to be in character. Just talk. If you want to through actions or observations in then by all means do it. It only tells people that much more about you.<br><br>I want everyone who is or was a Dane to post here. I want every idea of what to do possible. Wynddane says we need to recruit. I completely agree, what is stopping us? Are we afraid they are going to do somthing "undanelike?" Well hell Danes have been doing that for a long time. If people screw up there will be consequences simple.<br><br>If you have absolutely no idea what to do to help Dane then I ask that you make your presence known (That mean pushing the reply button and saying /em sits down at the meeting. then push the submit button at the very least. Also read, if you only want to skim over this thread the skim it, but at least get an idea of what is being said. If this is too much to ask, then push F1 and type /guildremove<br><br>I'm tired of people being in the guild for 2 months. Never visiting the site, never talking in guild. And then making a big scene when they leave and say that no one helped them anyway. I will take 5 active members over 100 people riding the coat tails any day.<br><br>So to make a long post short (Too Late). (This would be the part you skim to if you are skimming) It is a requirement that EVERYONE post on this thread. I obviously can't remove people who are no longer with Dane, so I'm ASKING that they contribute as well. The elders must have done somthing right.<br><br>Yes I have considered Disbanding the guild. What I am now saying is TALK ME OUT OF IT. Or say your good-byes. One way or another its all going to get decided here. <br><br>Deep Thoughts From a Shallow Mind<br>--Desperate Measures<br>Guild Leader of<br>The Hand Of Dane<br><br><br><br>width="388" height="154"&gt;<br><br><br><br><br> <br>  <br><br> RE: Crossroads <br><br> <br>      DesperateMeasur<br>Posted On 06/29/01 04:39AM <br><br><br>~Desperate now having a specific task moved quickly down the road. Being an aly to the Dwarfs had its advantages. He informed the border guards of his plans to use the Crossroads as a meeting place. And the small men were quick to call for chairs and torchs food and drink. They stepped up patroles to be sure that the local hoods couldn't interfere with the meeting.~<br><br>~Desperate sat on a stump infront of the empty out turned chairs and toked on his cigar. He hoped Llue would spread the word as he had been told but he wondered. He knew bringing ex-Danes and current Danes together would bring heated conversations. Was this a wise decision? Wise or not, it was a decision. He was tired of not acting, tired of just trying to calm the seas. He was going to ride out this storm to the very end. Even if it destroyed him in the process.~<br><br>~The smoke lingered up from his pipe and encircled his head. His eye cast down to the cut on his hand. It still hurt to make a fist. How long would it be before he could duel weild. Or Swing his axe with both hands? He said the tribunal had forsaken him, and he returned the gesture. By the end of this meeting he would find out if he was alone, or if he had to make amends to his gods.~ <br><br>Deep Thoughts From a Shallow Mind<br>--Desperate Measures<br>Guild Leader of<br>The Hand Of Dane<br><br><br><br>width="388" height="154"&gt;<br><br><br><br><br> <br>  <br><br> RE: Anger destroys everything until it is all that is left <br><br> <br>      Myssi<br>Posted On 06/29/01 04:59AM <br><br><br>~ Unknown to all, the Wise Druid that first sat as Counsel to Sylverdane, Second as Leader of Dane, and finaly now sits labeled the first destroyer of Dane; sits watching her friend's pain and anguish. Of those that remain, she and she alone can understand. Myssi was tempted to speak to Desperate in Gfay, but wisdom ruled that guidance can not be given, it must be sought ...<br><br>~ A few days pass and Myssi is darting through trees to Dalnir's crypt when she senses him. Her friend, the Barbarian boy she had rescued many a time, was in Warsilk's Woods. When she finally tracks him down, as usually he is bloodied, exhausted and near death.<br><br>~ It has been a long time since the two have seen each other. They great each other like time had never passed. Desperate began talking about the current state of Dane and she stopped him.<br><br>"Desperate, I may not be a Dane. I may not be liked by many a Dane. And I may even be seen as the first Destroyer of Dane, but I have watched over Dane. I know what has become of Dane." Myssi said. Desperate smiled, he knew this would be true. "Do you seek my wisdom and thoughts on the matters as I know and remember them?"<br><br>Desperate nodded, as all great Leaders understand that knowledge is everything. "Yes. Tell me your thoughts."<br><br>Myssi paused a moment. "I do not know all the specific details of the current comings and goings of Dane so I will not comment on them. More so I have a question for you ... I hear of a coup within Dane, and not to my surprise I hear Wynddane is the instigator of this. When Sylverdane left and passed Leadership to me, Wynddane quickly verbalized is objection to this decision. In his mind, HE was the rightful successor of Sylverdane and the rightful leader. There were others that agreed I was not the right choice for Leader. But there were also many, yourself included, that understood and accepted the decision. Not wanting to deal with the internal fighting and massive rift my being leader would cause, I quickly passed leadership to you and was the first the leave the Halls of Dane after Sylverdane walked before. I remember Wynddane then opposed your leadership as well, but quickly stopped his hissy. I would hate to see Dane leave from the lands, but remember this, ALWAYS remember this ... Sylverdane the first and greatest leader of Dane did not choose his brother as his successor ... Sylverdane chose me. Why? His wisdom will come to you. I could give you the answer, but what kind of quizzical mentor would I be?"<br><br>Desperate sat there at the entrance to Dalnir's and for the first time, Myssi saw the Barbarian ... thinking ...<br><br>/ooc I came and read this at the request of more than one Dane. So, before Wynddane or anyone else for that matter gets mad at me, my presence and response was requested on this matter and it is my understanding that many old Danes responses have been requested. I TRULY do not wish to see Dane leave EQ and hope ya'll can get things worked out. I wish you all the best and have complete faith and supoort in Desperate's decision.<br><br>Wise Druid once say: I have Starfire, Drifting Death and PMS.

Thinking hard.It souned as tho her Father had just dismissed her. Telling her to go home.....that it isnt her problem anymore. " Stupid Man she uttered....it IS my problem. You hurt I hurt. Danes hurt I hurt." Yelling to noone " Cant you see??? Danes will always be a part of me till I die!!"<br>~ Guiltily she looks around hopeing noone heard her disrespect at calling Desperate stupid. Men sometimes are so dense.<br>~ Sitting she finishes her rum. Torn between 2 families and her love of 2 men. One her husband one her father. She wants to beat them both with a stick. Both are head strong and stubborn. Neither listen to her unles she gets really REALLY MAD!! Maybe it is MAN thing.....maybe it is a ego thing.<br>~ Words I spoke had no effect on either of them.<br>~Sighing~ What I said was right. It is the eternal struggle with in that pulls at the seams of her family.<br>~ Using her best roguely ways she silently trails after her father. Wondering what he has on his mind? Where is he going?<br>~Trembeling she stalks him. Knowing that at any moment she could bring about her own death. Faydark is instant death to her kind....the dark elves. It is a risk she will take.....for her love knows no bounds.<br>~Standing off in the distance she heard Desperate and Llue exchanging words....Men! A silly poem at a time like this.<br>But wait...... this can reveal some things I think. The words ring true. There is an air about them. Mayhaps they are right.<br>~Stepping out from the shadows she reveals her presence only for a moment.....as the guards of Butcher Block Hate her. In her shourd of stealth she lays her hand upon Desperate's shoulder. " Father I am here, I will always be here. You cant just dismiss me and sent me home. I am a part of this.....you made it so. What I said to you has some merit.....about the struggle from within. I do not claim to know it all, I am far too young. I offer you only what I have learned. What you and the other Danes have taught me. I want to be at this meeting, but I cant. I have other things that pull me home. An evil stalks the Knights and they are in imminent danger. It breaks my heart to not be here for you. Even if you dont realize it you need me. Just as I need you."<br>~ Taking a deep breath she turns to leave, taking only 3 steps before running back.<br>~ Flinging her arms around a tall Barbarian isnt easy, but she manages to do so with a leap and bound. <br>~ Embracing Desperate she wispers to him..." Father I will not be long gone. I leave you with this. An ancient magical item I was given by Hbird Truesong, Mistress of Knights Errant.<br>~Pressing into his hand a golden pendant. A talsman of faith and truth. Only the best Knights of the Heronblade possess these. Showing him her palm she reveals the brand of the Dragon Reborn burned there. I too am Knight of the Heronblade. "You must not reveal me for it will mean my death if the Forsaken learn of me. No other Dark Elf has ever been taken in as a Knight. Take this pendant, keep it close to you. It will aid you in seeing the truth in the misdt of evil. As you hold it remember your daughter, who Loves you. Also remember to seek the truth and hold to your faith. Thru it I will always be with you. I Love You. You will find the right way I am sure. Send word to me as soon as you can. I have a battle of another kind to fight now.<br>I must go."<br>~ Letting go is the hardest part, but she knows she must. For her fellow Knights are in terrable danger and they need her.<br>~ Kissing the man she adores on the cheek she turns and runs for the boat to take her to her battle.<br>~ Knowing in her heart that there are 2 battles here. One of the flesh and one of the heart.<br>~" I Love You, dear Father she wispers to the wind...... I will always be with you..........<br><br>Desdmona Shadowborn <br><br><br><br> <br>  <br><br> RE: Anger destroys everything until it is all that is left <br><br> <br>      DesperateMeasur<br>Posted On 06/29/01 05:28AM <br><br><br>~Desperate sat silent listening to Myssi. They used to talk quite often, however alot of time had passed since thier last conversation. Desperate thought back:<br><br>~A young warrior, dressed in a god awful mixture of leather, ringmail and bronze armor sat at the bottom of Befallen cursing himself.~ "Why not go check out Befallen. I'm in my 25th season. I can take it. Solo." ~Desperate mocked himself. Hating this situation. He was at the bottom. Locked doors blocked his way out. What was worse, his suply of Duct tape was running low. With dread, the warrior sent the only Dane around a /msg.~<br><br>"How ya doin' Myssi." ~Desperate had finally found a quiet cornor to sit and heal. At least he hoped it would remain quiet. Asking for help did not come easy.~<br><br>"Uh, fine. And yourself?" ~Myssi didn't sound like she was expecting this /msg~<br><br>"Oh not too bad. Just taking a rest. Uh listen what do you know about Befallen?" ~Desperate heard a Dark Elf walk by his door.~<br><br>"Do you have the keys?"<br><br>"Keys? What keys?" ~Desperate chuckled unable to help himself.~<br><br>"Well don't go down there alone without any keys."<br><br>"I'll remember that." ~Desperate shook his head.~<br><br>"So what do you need?"<br><br>"Uh, well I came down here alone without any keys."<br><br>~It was Myssi's turn to laugh~<br><br>~The Next Day~<br><br>"Hey Dynomite." ~Desperate sent Myssi another /msg. He had started calling her Dynomite because in his eyes she proved that big things come in small packages.~<br><br>"Get stuck in any dungeons lately?" ~Myssi laughed. Desperate knew she was not going to let him live this down.~<br><br>"Naw I got out just fine. But I was wondering, what do you know about Cazic Thule?" ~Desperate stifled a laugh~<br><br>"Not too much. I don't hunt there often. Just stay away from the maze. Its easy to get lost and bombarded."<br><br>"You're telling me. I got all turned around and lost a corpse in there."<br><br>~Myssi laughed~<br><br>~Dynomite had pulled Desperate out of Befallen, and drug his lifeless body from the Cazic Maze. And no she never let him live it down.~ <br><br>Deep Thoughts From a Shallow Mind<br>--Desperate Measures<br>Guild Leader of<br>The Hand Of Dane<br><br><br><br>width="388" height="154"&gt;<br><br><br><br><br> <br>  <br><br> Memories Relived <br><br> <br>      DesperateMeasur<br>Posted On 06/29/01 05:58AM <br><br><br>~Desperate laughed remembering old times. But the question still hung in the air. Sylverdane hadn't chosen Wynddane for his successor.~<br><br>"Dynomite we've had some good times. Usually at my expense, but they were still fun. I remember the first time we met. The Dane's officer's meeting to decide the outcome of the war with The Begotten. You said, "Damn this guy's got balls as big as my breasts." I agreed with you. Dane should fight. You always had a good heart, quicker to give then recieve. Both gifts and attacks. But let me weave you a picture out of memories."<br><br>~Equinoxe and Taja had both Taken thier toll on Dane already. As had Begotten. There was turmoil both inside the family, and outside with Family of Peace. Sylverdane was under alot of pressure, pressure only a guild leader can understand. The fate of everyone in the family riding on his shoulders. With every decision he made. Wynd and Sylver had grown apart. Only slightly, but for brothers a small crack is a cannyon where there had never been one.~<br><br>~The Hand of Dane never had too many Clerics among us. We are more about having fun, and enjoying the moment. And the life of a Cleric is one of hard work and Dedication. Wynddane didn't believe that he was getting the guidance he needed from Dane. His Neice Cleverdane had recently married Darum, the leader of Black Claws. Both clerics themselves. He hoped to find the direction with them that was not available with Dane.~<br><br>~The times were trying, and Wynddane's departure came at an ill time. Sylverdane felt betrayed. That crack grew. Sylverdane tried to hold the family and himself together, but the stress just kept building. He was hastey in decisions. Which isn't to say they were wrong, they just weren't his usual well thought out plans. When he finally decided to leave Dane, I was out hunting and couldn't be reached. The meeting that was called included only a handfull of what was then more then 200 Danes.~<br><br>"Dynomite the words that were crossed with you, came from Macdane. A young and headstrong dane with a story all his own. It was his belief that Dane should remain with Dane. That is a Dane should run it. Had your name been MyssiDane he would have accepted you no doubt." ~Desperate took a long pull from his pipe.~<br><br>~After Myssi took control of Dane, the foundation shook. And sides were instantly split. Half of the family believed that Myssi, the then ex-leader of Hammers of Vengeance was an obvious and good choice, while the rest weren't so much against her as for Sylverdane. No one would accpet that he was gone. Not even Desperate. There was nothing Desperate wanted more then to follow Sylverdane if only he would lead. But if Sylver's order was for Myssi, Desperate would follow her in his stead.~<br><br>~The split in Dane shook it hard. Another reason Desperate called Myssi Dynomite was her temper. It flared with little warning. She was quick of tongue and quicker to act. One too many crossed words flew at her and she retorted. When the smoke cleared Myssi knew she couldn't lead Dane. She had spoken with Sylverdane, and in the course of time words crossed between them, scarring thier friendship. It was decided that Fuduce would be her successor.~<br><br>~Her impatience grew as the onslaught came from members of Dane. This time it was her turn to send a /msg to Desperate for help.~<br><br>"Now don't freak out. And don't say a word until I explain" ~Myssi said quietly to Desperate, who in turn nodded~<br><br>~/~Desperate Is now the LEADER of Hand of Dane~/~<br><br>~Freaked would have been the understatement of the century. He had to play events backwards in his head.~<br><br>"I can't lead Dane. I swore I would never again lead a guild." -- "Wait, Myssi gave me control? How did she become leader? When did she become leader?" -- "Sylverdane's gone?" <br><br>~Desperate jumped to his feet awaiting the explanation. Myssi told him what had happened, between her and Dane, her and Wynd, her and Sylver. That Desperate was only to hold the position until he could locate Fuduce. Desperate was torn. Dizzy with thought.~<br><br>"Sylverdane left? I can't believe he left without talking to me. I know I'm only one of his officers. One of many, but I'm also his friend. And have been longer then I've been an officer. His brother. His son."<br><br>"Myssi is leaving? Why would she turn from Dane so quickly?" ~Forgetting his own first reaction to recieving leadership.~ "Myssi can't leave. I'm loosing two friends in one day. I knew Wynd's departure was only the first drop of rain in a storm to follow"<br><br>"If Myssi leaves who will follow her? Hammer's of Vengeance? Darkdane? Lupher? Inen? Haidit? Dreamwork? Dreamwork was just made an officer, and really shineing as one."<br><br>~Desperate calmed down. Him and Myssi spoke, when it became apparent that nothing could be sovled until either Fuduce or Sylver appeared Desperate turned the conversation. Talking about lighter matters as if nothing mattered. By the time Myssi had left for the day, Desperate went to Cazic Thule, asking his question to the lizards there. And crushing them with his Blackened Iron Bastard Sword when they didn't know the answer. The /msg did eventually come~ <br><br>Deep Thoughts From a Shallow Mind<br>--Desperate Measures<br>Guild Leader of<br>The Hand Of Dane<br><br><br><br>width="388" height="154"&gt;<br><br><br><br><br> <br>  <br><br> The Fall <br><br> <br>      DesperateMeasur<br>Posted On 06/29/01 06:44AM <br><br><br>~Desperate took another long pull from his cigar. And continued painting his picture with words for his old friend.~<br><br>~Sylverdane and Emaus teleported into Cazic Thule and we spoke. Sylverdane knew his departure was hasty, he didn't have everything worked out in his own mind yet but he wanted to try to save his family once again. It was wildly said that Dane could not survive without either Sylver or Myssi in charge, and no one especially Sylver wanted to see it fail.~<br><br>~Desperate paused as he remembered so many saying that without Myssi or Sylver Dane would die. The words struck him down deep, cutting him inside. Was he destined to fail as the head of the family even then?~<br><br>~Desperate cleared his head and continued. By the end of the day, Sylverdane knelt before me and I returned control of the family to him, then in turn knelt once again to my mentor. Stood and embraced a brother returned.~<br><br>~Sylverdane cleaned house, but spoke little to or of Wynddane. Dane was rocky at first but again strengthened under his command. As expected Hammer's of Vengeance defended thier leader and left Dane with Myssi. All except Dreamwork who still stood as one of the greatest officer's in Dane. Handeling every situation quickly and efficently.~<br><br>"Dynomite I will never forget when you sacrificed yourself for Lord Sylver. You took his place under the axe of Begotten to prevent him from kneeling to them. But when Family of Peace declared all out war on us. You weren't there to save Dane, or Sylver."<br><br>~Even as the morter was drying on the cracks in Dane, Family of Peace struck and struck hard. Wynddane returned to Dane and trained with Shandar Staley and Desperate in Kunark to prepare for the war. Rudra came back as a shining general leading Dane to several victories in the war that couldn't be won.~<br><br>~It is said you are judged by the company you keep. It was proven right for two members of Dane. Who had friends with shady backgrounds. Darkenbane members. And when these sisters were getting attacked by MtS ((OOC:Sory still can't spell that guild's name)) they turned to thier friends for help. Most of the Danes were tied up in the current war with FoP, and the Sisters were unable to recieve help from thier family.~<br><br>~In less then a day rumors and accusations of a Dane, Darkenbane alliance spread. The greatest guild of good, and the worst of Evil allied? Impossible, but people are easily swayed to believe the impossible. The fact that MtS was made up of ex Family of Peace got lost in the grey lines of right and wrong. And a second war overlapped the first. Rudra's victories seemed small in comparision to the comming battles. Every Dane of age was hunted and beaten down.~<br><br>~Adaley, the heart of Dane fell in the war time and time again. And time and time again she stood up and fought. But it took more then anyone realized. The spells and blades cut her clean through to her soul and heart. The heart of Dane was pierced and shed tears on a bloodied battle field.~<br><br>"Hammers of Vengeance were just rebuilding at this point and couldn't offer thier help. Black Claws weren't organized enough. Knights Errant, Death Dealers, assistance was available from none of our allies. Swarm of Fear and Insanities Edge were at war with FoP and seemed to have a tiger by the tail. They picked thier fights carefully and avoided them otherwise. All too often Dane was left alone on the field of battle."<br><br>"Sylverdane's health was deteriorating. There were times he could barely stand up. Both guilds took advantage of Sylverdane's weakened condition. Attacking him every chance they got. Darkenbane was starting up a game. Where they were going to award points for PKing. Reign of Pain has always had a distaste for Hand of Dane, and they joined the onslaught. Dane's were butchered at every cornor. The mightiest guild in all of Norrath was standing on a wounded leg and everyone seemed to want to be the first to knock it over."<br><br>"I had taken up temperary unofficial control of Dane while Sylver recooperated. Handling the goings on, trying to save the Danes that chose to stay."<br><br>~Finally things became too much. All Sylverdane wanted was peace. That was all he ever wanted. "To be respected with out fear". Start a little casino in Norrath. Make some money, hunt with his family. He loved Dane, but when he talked about his casino that he would build, his eyes lit up. He could actually see the Roulette table, the pet fights, the poker tables~<br><br>"When the heartattack hit him, everyone was shocked. Everyone except me. It sucked the life right out of him, watching Dane go down and being powerless to stop it. I truely know how he felt. He has since forgiven Wynddane, but at the time the betrayal of his departure still stung his weakened heart. He talked to me about taking leadership of Dane. I swore to him that I would never run a guild again. And the only reason I was part of one now was because it was a family, not a guild."<br><br>"I can still remember the meeting where Sylverdane was going to step down offically as leader. I hadn't said that I would accept the position. I wanted to see the reaction. I did not want the family to be split yet again on who to follow. If Dane was going to follow me, then they were all going to follow. That was the only condition."<br><br>"It was Wynddane that nominated me as Lord Sylverdane's Successor. Salamandar seconded it, and it was unanamously voted in. I never tried to fill Sylverdane's shoes. Just his shadow. When Wynddane nominated me I was blown away. We had exchanged words several times. Our history is, a rocky one at best. And in truth I haven't forgiven him for leaving. But even with all that was between us, he believed I was the best thing for Dane. He is an unselfish man, you don't give him enough credit."<br><br>"With Wynddane seeking my replacement I know that in his heart he is doing it for Dane, not himself."<br><br>~With that Desperate rose, and bowed before Myssi.~ "Lady Myssi McDoogle, join the Danes for this meeting. You once served alongside Syvlerdane, as well as succeeded him. You are a part of Dane history, it is fitting that you be apart of our future as well."<br><br><br><br>Deep Thoughts From a Shallow Mind<br>--Desperate Measures<br>Guild Leader of<br>The Hand Of Dane<br><br><br><br>width="388" height="154"&gt;<br><br><br><br><br> <br>  <br><br> A Rogue's Gift <br><br> <br>      DesperateMeasur<br>Posted On 06/29/01 07:03AM <br><br><br>((OOC: When posts overlap there are always a few holes. Myssi's story took place in game, which is how I ended up in Dalnir for those that are lost ~smirks~))<br><br>~Myssi and Desperate teleported back to Bucherblock Mountains. Though weather or not she would remain for the meeting she hadn't said. While Desperate overlooked the still empty chairs he rolled his weary neck. Trying to work out the kinks that came from a long night. So much undone, so much to do.~<br><br>~Desdmona laid a hand on Desperate's shoulder. He tensed under her touch. Wishing briefly that people would stop sneaking up on him. He turned quickly and saw his daughter. Much like with Wynd, when startled his first instict was to attack. Maybe instictively he knew it was a woman's hand on his shoulder, or maybe being so tired had slowed him. But he saw the face of his Daughter before he attacked, and calmed himself quickly~<br><br>"I am here, you can't just dismiss me.." ~Desdmona had alot to say, Desperate tried to appoligize if it seemed he had turned his back on her, or told her to go away, but she was determined to get every word out. Women can be so stuborn.~<br><br>~The rogue turned to walk away befure Desperate had said a word. He was about to call her back, wishing that he could go with her to help, when she turned and threw herself on him. The warrior was used to taking blow after blow in a fight, standing his ground even when defeat was certain, but as this small woman hugged him feircly he rocked back on his heels. Returning the hug he wanted to tell her everything would be okay, he wanted to reassure her, but life was never as simple as it was in the bards tales.~<br><br>~He silently took the pendent she offered him, its edge pressed against the still tender cut in his palm. The gods way of telling him to pay attention no doubt. He watched her walk away again, her words ringing in his ears. Thier meaning slowly working its way through his mind. He watched her vanish in silence.~<br><br>~Desperate marveled, Rogues, the outcasts of society. Living by thier own rules, and thier wits. Seemed to posses a talent for loyality that even a paladin would have to admire if they would take the time. Is it a wonder his best friends were Rogues, and some of his closest family.~<br><br>~Desperate lit another cigar and sat in silence the words he spoke to Myssi still ringing in his ears.

As she came closer, she realized it was Desperate. But he was not the same Desperate she had left months ago, he was no longer the man she had once known. The distraught warrior had seen her coming a few yards back but he didn't look up when she was just a few feet infront of him. <br><br>Not knowing what to say, she sat on the ground next to the man she has always respected and loved...<br><br>loved? She thought to herself.<br><br>They sat in silence for what seemed to be an unbearable amount of time, but she still was at a loss for words. So many things to say and yet...she didn't know where to begin.<br><br>Finally, breaking down...unable to keep a lock down on her emotions...she found herself embracing Desperate and his arms receiving her.<br><br>RS<br><br>Message Edited on 06/29/01 11:23AM by Ilaenu<br><br>Message Edited on 06/29/01 11:29AM by Ilaenu  <br>  <br><br> RE: A Rogue's Gift <br><br> <br>      Wynddane<br>Posted On 06/29/01 09:27AM <br><br><br>:::Wynddane got on the boat from the docks on Firiona vie and sat on the bottom compartment of the boat...looking like the shell of a man he once was....rumors circulated that Desperate was holding a meeting for all past and current Danes. Wynddane mutters to himself::::<br><br>"Well....old cleric...here it is...do we go or do we not. Many that will be there do not like you.I heard Myssi was there....she is not some one i wish to see. She has had resentment towards ME for no reason. I was silent with her taking over Dane. Mac Supported her.,...it was Justtin that hotheaded pally that didn't agree with her taking over.She has held ill will towards me for too long.She will frustrate me if i go.But if i do not.....where does Wynddane Soulcleanser stand then? It seems from what i am hearing most current and past Danes think of me as a traitor...me?....thew only one of the originals left. How could they?....Has everything i have done fer Dane beenm for nothing?"<br><br>::Wynddane havn't even noticed that the boat got to the docks in BB....he stood on the docks wondering if he should attend.In his hand are the Dane colors. He can't help but wonder if they believe he has done this much harm to Dane...then maybe it will be better without him.He sits on the docks of BB now watching the sunset again....thinking about all that are gone to him now....all of his friends....Rudra...alexios....pepie....Sylverdane....emaus....riverdane.....darkdane.....myssi.....Desdmona....rolloe.....tryzen....all that meant so much to him. He speaks..::<br><br>"Mithaniel please help me....my faith has gotten me through all that Norrath has thrown at me...but this....this....i feek i am an orphan in a starnge land....i am an outcast now it seems....Myssi putting a stamp of approval on that when I have done NOTHING to her. I can't believe she can still hold a grudge!!"<br><br>"" He begins to cast a spell....one he is not very familiar with.....one he has just learned.....his green eyes begin to gleam....his red hair begins to swirl as all of his emotions run forth and a dwarf that sits on the docks in BB feels it....he utters"<br><br>" Its time for some Retribution!"<br><br>"The dwarf fell in 2 casts....this is significant wynd thinks::::<br><br><br>" i have never killed an innocent like that.....what is happening to me?....Marr please guide my way"<br><br><br>:::Before he can finish that sentence the clouds in the sky over Norrath opened up....a beam of sunlight hit Wynddane in the head the moved to the road that leads to the crossroads in BB...Wynddane looks around but the beam of sunlight just hits the road.....nowhere else....he looks up and begins to run down the road....he has th spirit of the wolf so it shouldn't take him too long....in the distance he sees a Bard....and what looks like Desdmona...but he definitely sees the unmistakable figure of Desperate....he walks up very slow.....they did not notice him...Desperate is the 1st to see him...and even the barbarian takes a step back....he looks in Wynddanes eyes and knows hre is not the same man....Desperate has seen this coming a while...but he is still taken back. Wynddane throws his Dane colors at Desperate and speaks:::<br><br>" I'm sorry My lord.....i was trying to help the guild...no matter what our relationship has been like...Marr has brought me here to face you one on one.....whatever the results may be....do what you must with my colors....for my heart is empty....and i am lost....~he glances at desdmona~<br>I have never known the love you have....my only love was this guild.....~he glances at Myssi~ YOU.....you have misplaced your anger on me Myssi.....i leave it at that....~he glances at Desperate~ Do what you must my lord...."<br><br>~Wynddane turns his back and begins to walk away from the meeting....he looks back ...tears leaving his eyes like a flood....he whispers....<br><br>" i was trying to help Dane"<br><br><br><br><br>Wynddane Soulcleanser<br>Cleric of Marr'<br>45th Season <br><br> <br>  <br><br> :::After months on the road, Reesey returns to Dane Manor... <br><br> <br>      Ilaenu<br>Posted On 06/29/01 09:47AM <br><br><br>but as she entered the grounds, she felt something amiss in the air. She took her steps more cautiously as the unsteady feeling continued to grow. <br><br>Her heart leaped into the back of her throat, pictures of her family...which had once hung so proudly on the great walls of the house of dane, now laid in disarray on the dusty floor. The once bustling estate was now filled with a dread silence. <br><br>Reesey had never felt so alone in her life, her husband, Stonedane had dropped off the face of Norrath and there was no welcoming party to greet her.<br><br>She roamed the grounds for a good hour or so, only to confirm that she was, indeed, alone. Disturbed, Reesey headed down a dark hallway to her room. She arrived at her room and stood at the door for a brief moment, the door creaked loudly as she opened. <br><br>Her room was still as she left it. She looked at her nightstand only to have her heart sink, there sat a picture of Stonedane and her on their wedding day. A lump started forming in her throat and she felt her eyes get moist. At this, she grabbed the frame and placed it face down in her top drawer. <br><br>She had been traveling with a heavy heart for weaks and coming home to the unknown had put an even heavier burden on her. Her body was tense and rigid, she needed to unwind. She ran a bath and was half naked when a knock came to her door.<br><br>She wrapped herself in her robe and opened the door. Her eyes lit up and a smile came to her face, "Hey, you!"<br><br>RS <br><br><br> Ilaenu Tru'Hael <br>51 Enchantress <br>ReveredRallos Zek <br><br><br><br>Message Edited on 06/29/01 10:56AM by Ilaenu  <br>  <br><br> RE: :::After months on the road, Reesey returns to Dane Manor... <br><br> <br>      Stonelor<br>Posted On 06/29/01 11:31AM <br><br><br>I am here brothers. and so are the Arcon Brothers.

"Have you gone to see your father the lunatic?"said Topa. Mona replied as she quickly turned to look at her guest, "HOW DARE YOU SAY.....Oh it's you." "What the HELL is going on??"Mona questioned still fierce from the fight as well as from her own thoughts. Topa tore a chunk out of the tree. "This tree is rotting." Mona replied" Every thing does" Topa smirked &amp; hopped down from the tree branch lighting his cigar along the way. <br><br>"Then why are you so disstraught??" Mona said "because I'm not thinking about a tree" Topa Replied, "What makes you think a guild is any different? Everything comes &amp; goes it's the nature of things us roges just observe it happening &amp; attempt to prosper from it somehow. Lockheart fell Darkenbane will fall Black Claws will fall Knights Errant will fall &amp; The Hand of Dane seems to be falling as we speak. perhaps some will survive untill antonica falls into the sea But they'll all fall eventually." Desdmona looked puzzeled for a moment. "Thats a dreadfull way to look at things." Topa smirked "There is much profit to be made in the Rise &amp; fall of a guild it is nothing for a rogue to dread." <br><br>The two rogues had allways had a good relationship. Topa was the elder rogue experianced in many things that others would not understand yet Mona understood. Mona was the skilled rogue her skills were unequal to any other Topa had met. <br><br>"Do you not care what is happening to our family?"Mona asked. "of course I care" Replied Topa "I have been here from the start of it all. I have seen HoD rise from the ashes of Lockheart. I have seen HoD rise from its own ashes. I have seen one of our oldest members attempt to obtain control of HoD time &amp; time again causing himself to be untrusted by manny. If I did not care I would not have been here this long. My brother is a great leader yet I miss Sylver. Yet despite how much I care or what I think Dane will fall &amp; from its ashes will arise something new something pure. It's just the way things are &amp; when this rotting tree finally falls its seeds will be spread &amp; three new trees will rise in its place." <br><br>Mona looked away from the barbarian. "my husband called this my failing guild" topa just smirked"his will fail as well..eventually, The question is will he be as remembered? HoD has spread further than you think(ooc&gt; hod is being started on several different games)&amp; our decendants Will hold our memories. The Hand of Dane will fall yet Dane itself will live on." <br><br>Mona replied "but we can save it again I'm certain" but as she turned to look towards her fellow rogue, her uncle, he wasn't there. He was nowhere to be found.Mona rested under the tree &amp; thought ~Why, Why do you allways leave more questions than answers?~ <br><br>~Topasere~<br>~To steal from the rich &amp; give to the poor means to be poor &amp; steal untill you become Rich!!~<br><br>p&gt;<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Message Edited on 06/29/01 12:14PM by Topasere  <br>  <br><br> RE: Crossroads <br><br> <br>      mrbreeze6<br>Posted On 06/29/01 03:37PM <br><br><br>*a strong breeze, blows though the air in the butcherblock mountians, and centers around the crossroads among, danes and exdanes*<br><br>*the wind had the distict smell of lotus, and tobacco, and smelled warm and inviting*<br><br>"i have arrived." *solux says appearing from oblivion*<br><br>*with pipe in hand he walks up to to the table and stands in front of his seat, preapring his speech.*<br><br>solux mindwarp<br>34th enchanter<br>2years rallos zek<br>hand of dane <br><br> <br>  <br><br> RE: Crossroads <br><br> <br>      mrbreeze6<br>Posted On 06/29/01 03:43PM <br><br><br>*solux looks around, seeing friends, and peaple who he had never meet before*<br><br>"well i guess ill break the ice."<br><br>"id like to start by saying that whatever is going on between wyndane and desperate, needs to be settled asap as they are the 2 top members of this guild, and i am staying neutral and will only comment on what i think is best for the guild, in that situation."<br><br>"also i know i dont really know many of you but we will have a chance to get to know each other atleast alittle better though this meeting."<br><br>"and before i get started i just want you to know that, these are simply my opinions, and im just tossing ideas around."<br><br>solux <br><br> <br>  <br><br> RE: Crossroads <br><br> <br>      mrbreeze6<br>Posted On 06/29/01 03:55PM <br><br><br>" first as far as recruiting goes, i think we need to recruit, but not just anyone, we need to try and get to know the peaple we invite beofre we just let them in, and i also think we need a experience limit a warrior of 10 seasons will not beable to help the family in our trying times like a warrior of 30th season would."<br><br>*takes long puff and lets out a smoke ring*<br><br>" but we also need more officer, as you all know most of the peaple who have left recently have been officers and were among the most respected of danes, we need to replace them or our situation can only get worse."<br><br>"moreover we need to get to know each other, and become more of a family, we need to try to take time to seek one another out and hunt or atleast talk face to face and hang out together. desperate, myself and cleverdane where hunting undead in kithcor and we had time to talk during daylight hours while we hunted at night and had great exp."<br><br>"as far as dane not being like it was in the old days, i can only say ive been here tow years and thing have changed in the norrath not just dane and sometimes you have to adabt to survive."<br><br>"now i truely wish what is best for dane and do not want to see us disbanded, believe me ive had offerrs to join other guilds but have steadfast refused"<br><br>"also to be more like a family we need to do things together besides just talk and occasionally hunt we need to do raids to let other peaple see us in action and want to join us, this will also five us time to bond."<br><br>"well thanks for lessoning and im sure thier are other who would like to speak so ill take my seat"<br><br>solux <br><br> <br>  <br><br> And Thus it Begins <br><br> <br>      DesperateMeasur<br>Posted On 06/29/01 05:56PM <br><br><br>~Desperate sat, lost in thought. His mind going over every idea he had heard in the past months. Every member who had stayed and everyone who had left. The new blood, and the elders.~<br><br>~Desperate casted his eyes up and saw a familiar figure Gliding down the path towards him. When Ilaenu reached Desperate she seemed filled of words and emotions, and yet none came to her lips. He sat in silence waiting for her to speak in her own time. He wanted to embrace her and welcome her, but these days he didn't know who came to support dane and who came to watch it fall. He was sure Ilaenu would take the side of her family, but he would wait for her words.~<br><br>~Without a word she wrapped her arms around him. Desperate sat there shocked for a moment. Then wrapped his own arms around the small Entrantress. When finally they parted his eye met hers and he smiled. "Congragulations on your marriage darlin'. I hope your husband is able to attend."<br><br>~Still apparenlty unsure of what to say, Ilaenu sat back down. For the second time Desperate wanted to reassure someone of things he himself were unsure. But he was silenced by a break in the clouds, turning his gaze back down the road he saw his brother flying with the wolf towards him.~ <br><br>Deep Thoughts From a Shallow Mind<br>--Desperate Measures<br>Guild Leader of<br>The Hand Of Dane<br><br><br><br>width="388" height="154"&gt;<br><br><br><br><br> <br>  <br><br> The Awaited Confrentation <br><br> <br>      DesperateMeasur<br>Posted On 06/29/01 06:09PM <br><br><br>~Desperate stood as Wynddane was carried quickly to the crossroads. Desperate's eyes met his brother's and was knocked back, though not shocked, by what he saw. The turmoil had been building since Sylver left the guild. Wynddane had changed from a passive priest, to one of anger. He thought of how much alike Wynd and himself were. Thier emotions carried high and low with the sucess and faliur of the family. Always a mirror image of each other.~<br><br>~Briefly Despearte remembered the punch he had given Wynddane. The shot sent out of furry, and shock. He had not intended to hit Wynd, but he didn't stop himself either. Desperate hadn't realzied who he hit until after the fact. Or maybe he had. Maybe thier similarities were too much. Desperate looked into his own eyes when he looked at Wynd. These thoughts flooded Desperate's mind as did others. What will he do? What will his actions be? Will he attack me? Will he turn his back? Will he support the family? Has he found a replacement for me? What deamons is he wrestling with? Are they my own?~<br><br>~Desperate was shocked to hold in his hands Wynddane's colors. The colors of Dane. Wynd turned to walk away. Wynddane always got the last word in, but this time he didn't seem concerned he just turned and walked off.~<br><br>~Stop him. Do somthing. Desperate stepped behind Wynd in time to see a tear slide down his cheek. The warrior stopped in his tracks. The two men stared at each other in silence. Then Wynddane turned and started away again.~<br><br>~Desperate reached out and grabbed the Clerics shoulders. Wynd turned around so quickly again Desperate thought Wynd would return the punch Desperate had given him. No attack came.~<br><br>"I guess this is how a Cleric gives up?" ~Desperate slammed Wynddane's colors back into his hand.~ "You promised me, the last two Danes. You vowed you would not leave me or the family again. Now you turn your back? AGAIN!?" ~Desperate was again yelling. His brother was leaving again.~ "Wynd this meeting is for Dane's past and present. You are a founder" ~Desperate regained his composure~ "I don't have the luxery of being able to turn my back on them. Someone had to be in charge. Someone had to be here. Past and present Danes. You belong here even if you are leaving. I'm going back to my family. Do as you will brother." ~Desperate turned and walked back to the meeting grounds.~<br><br>~Desperate met the eyes of all that had gathered. Some of his words no doubt carried to thoses here. The warrior smiled and waved off the questions. Taking Stonelor's hand in his. Engulfing the young clerics hand and shaking it. Good to see you made it.~ <br><br>Deep Thoughts From a Shallow Mind<br>--Desperate Measures<br>Guild Leader of<br>The Hand Of Dane<br><br><br><br>width="388" height="154"&gt;<br><br><br><br><br> <br>  <br><br> The Meeting Continues <br><br> <br>      DesperateMeasur<br>Posted On 06/29/01 06:19PM <br><br><br>~Solux had several ideas of how Dane should be. Desperate silently listened to them all. His eye moving down the road to where his brother had gone. Wondering if he stood just out of sight, debating returning, or had he forsaken Dane? When Solux finished Desperate tried to address the points made by him~<br><br>"Solux you've got a good heart, and a good mind for things. I've thought several times of promoting you to an officership. You need more experience that only comes with responsibility of an officer. You might well make a good leader one day.<br><br>Lets look at what you've said. "We shoudl recruit, but put limits on who. Get to know them and be sure of the peopel we bring into our family."<br><br>"I agree with this strongly. But believe me, you will never know someone. We have had a Dane that has joined many pk guilds. He is a good man and I trust him. But he is also good enough to be trusted by the vile guilds he infiltrates. If someone wants to join a guild, with intentions of ruining it, they will. And no time limit or experience restraint will stop that. I think the best way to get to know someone is by hunting with them and getting to know them. But there are some things you never know about someone until you live with them. I'm not saying to give an invite to every joe that runs by. But if you think someone is worthy of holding the colors of Dane, offer them and see what happens."<br><br>"As for level restrictions, Dane has never been about restricting who can enter and who can't. We've had Ex-Darkenbane members with us. We've had people who you wouldn't normally associate with Dane and yet they did quite well. If we restict experience, what next? No Ogre's because they aren't intelligent? No Dark Elves because they are hard to trust? I ask you Solux, what level were you when you joined Dane? ~Desperate casted his eyes to a another.~ Stonelor? I was in my earliest training when I joined. Some of the most loyal members I have ever had, stayed because of the help they got when they most needed it.

She is weary. Her heart is heavy with thoughts of her family(s). There are 2 of them. Holding up her hands in a balance fashon she ponders......how to balance them. Her heart is aching and her head is pounding. Silently she falls into a deep sleep.~<br>~ But to her is it a dream or is it real? Upon entering Telerhad, the place where the dreamwaklers go she vaguely reacalls the talk she had with her Uncle, Topasere. About the tree. How it is falling? Twisted around this is memories of battles that are gone by. Battles of glory that she remembers Desperate telling her about. How from this can things be right? It is all confused in her mind.~<br>~Wresteling with the problems she faces for battle and the situation with Dane, memories of past and present become blurred in her mind. With the falling of the tree so comes new life. Is that what that means? Is her beloved family to fall? Will it survive, but in a new reborn state? Damm Topasere and his riddles!~<br>~In her dream state she must be yelling. For a she is awakenrd by a man. Someone she remembers, but from where?<br>~"My child," you were crying in your sleep. I could not help but wake you from your fitfull dream. Tell me what has you weeping in your dreams?" Shaking Desdmona tries to think. Where do I know you? Who are you? "Am I dreaming," She asks? " Aye," my child you are still here in Telerhad. "What business do you have in the land of the dream walkers," he asks? " I dream of battle and the struggle within Sir."<br>~ Slowly he take her hand and twists it. "You bear the mark of the Dragon Reborn!! How can this be? You are not of us? You skin is dark!! Tell me who are your parents!! Tell me quick Child or I shall strike you as you sit here!!" "I... I do not know of my real parents. They left me in the city of Dark Elves a long time ago. Is is rumored that I am the making of a beautifull Dark Elf Necromancer named, Neave and a Barbarian Warrior named Lann Mandragon. That is all I know. I swear!! I grew up with no one till I found the Danes. They taught me honor and truth and how to be a Knight." "You lie!! You did not recieve this from them I know. This mark belongs only to the Knights of the Heronblade" " No Sir I did not. It came from my new family The Knights Errant. They bestowed it on me. Telling me it was sacred that I was never to speak of it."<br>~Nodding the man seems to reason this out.~ " I now know how you came to be here....you possess the gift. The gift of dreamwalking. It came from Lann, your real father. He was a great Warder to your mother. It is said when she died he too died because the Warder bond is so strong he could not live with out her."~<br><br><br> <br>  <br><br> RE: Crossroads <br><br> <br>      mrbreeze6<br>Posted On 06/29/01 07:32PM <br><br><br><br>*stands form his seat to speak8<br><br>"well actually i was lvl 25 when i joined dane...,but i see your point desperate, and i know loyalty comes easier from peaple who are with a guild from an early level, it happened with my friend sylanos, we joined dane but left for his old guild...i understand where you are coming from on this point, so ill drop it'<br><br>*takes a puff off his pipe and smiles*<br><br>" i was also thinking we need to look ahead and maybe trying to find some alliences, with high level guilds, i have contacts in revered, paragima, and full circle of faith, and was even a member of FCoF when it first started and wasa member for along time..but thats in my past..."<br><br>*takes his seat*<br><br>solux mindwarp <br><br> <br>  <br><br> RE: Crossroads <br><br> <br>      Wynddane<br>Posted On 06/29/01 07:34PM <br><br><br>:::Wynddane sat stunned at the words Desperate threw his way...he saw Desperate embrace Stonelor...the only man he ever thought truly understood him in dane...seeing he was a cleric himself and very few were in Dane.He yells to Desperate:::<br><br>" Brother!

The one he pray to and curses in the same breath? You are not my God, I do not know you."<br>"Aye but you do," replied the man. "I have walked with you always. I guided you to Desperate. I visit you in your dreams. In the battles in which you though you would surely die twas I who guided your blade. I brought you to Aerimus your mate now. You dont realize it but your marriage is the same as your parents. The bond of Aies Sedi and Warder. Did you not know the second you saw him he belonged to you? When you touched him did you not take on his feelings?? His essence and he yours?" ~ Desdmona nodded~<br>" Even now I guide you. You have spoken my words to Desperate. The words I spoke to you in your dreams. It will be to his deciding if he heeds them or not. You can do no more, Child. Now you face a different battle one you will die in surely if you do not prepare. You must let this go or die! The tree is rotted, it must fall to be reborn and you must do nothing to impeed this!! You are part of its rebirth. You are a seed. As you grow more you will tell of this event to others. You will share your honor and truth like a passionate flame. NOW prepare for battle or you will DIE!! Desprate will manage. He has lived over 20 seasons without you. I brought you to him to guide him not to be his mother. I sent you to him as a child just so you might advise and also learn. Which I see you have, or you would not bear this mark upon your hand. As I said PREPARE or DIE!!"<br>~ With a start Desdmona awoke. Did I dream this or was it real? Lann Mandragon? My real father is dead, but the one she calls father still lives.<br>~Silently she begins her forms....cat on a wall, bending willow tree. As her body moved with her wepon it became clearer. What is done is done and what will be will be. I carry within me the power. The ability to pass on this honor I have learned. That is my legacy. Dane will not live or die by her hand. My adopted father will stand, I have done all I can.<br>~It is onward to battle!! The Knights of the Heronblade need her!~<br>~She winds her body to perform hawk in battle and her dagger clatters to the floor~<br>" What is happening to me," she cried!! ~Clutching her head she cries in pain as she falls to the floor.~<br>Vaguely she hears a wisper in her mind..............." I have given you one more gift. The gift of knowing."<br>~ "NOOOOO, no now I do not wish this," Desdmona cried!<br>" You have no choice the man laughed. Who do you think you are?? A mortal?? <br>~A flash exploded in her mind. It burned her nerve endings and made her skin tingle and she knew............ <br>"ONWARD TO BATTLE SHE CRIED......ONWARD TO BATTLE!!!"<br>Desdmona Shadowborn <br><br> <br>  <br><br> Brothers In Arms, Brother's at Arms <br><br> <br>      DesperateMeasur<br>Posted On 06/30/01 04:18AM <br><br><br>~Far from his brother's riddles, his daugher's danger and his Gods words Desperate stood in a steadily growing circle of Danes. Wynddane had returned to the circle, but to what avail. Wynddane supported Dane, this Desperate always knew, but what else was his agenda?~<br><br>"You doubt the sharpness of my wit? You doubt my convictions? What in me do you see that is unfit to stand as head of Dane?" ~Desperate's anger was steadily becoming legendary. Flashing as hot and fast as a bolt from the heavens.~ "We come here for answers, we come here for decisions as yet unmade. Dane is at a crossroad. As are we. Stand with your brothers and sisters and speak your mind."<br><br>~Wynddane remained silent. Desperate did not want this battle to be between Wynddane and himself. Atention and energy was being spent between the two and was just going to waste. Thier difference were insignificant in comparision to those that lay at the feet of the family this day. A warrior and a cleric, a human and a barbarian. The men lead completely different lives. Each with a dependance for the other in battle. But after the klank of steel, and dizzing colors of spells faded the dependency was looked at with distaste. Of needing another. It had always been so, and would always be. But Desperate wanted to lay that aside, and look upon Wynd as a man and as a brother.~<br><br>"You've called me a tyrant. You've said I act like a king. Neither of these do I see as decerning features in myself. But all too often we stand too close to our own faults to see thier truth. Mayhaps I am tyranical." ~Desperate chuckled softly~ "Just maybe I'm even a little crazy."<br><br>~Desperate turned to the Danes. Turning his head slowly, looking each in the eye. Breathing with his brother's and sisters. The same air, the same fear. The Tribunal once stood as his gods and his judges. But now his judges were his family.~ <br><br>Deep Thoughts From a Shallow Min

The warrior knew the problems needed to be hashed out. But already too much had been wasted on the feud between them. Wynddane reffers to his own words as Blashphomy and Insobordination, Desperate did not paint him with that brush. Desperate did not look upon him as a traitor. As the leader of this family, Desperate still had many meetings he needed to conduct, one on one with members, allies and enemies alike. He made a note to hash this out with his brother one on one as soon as he could. For now, the crack between them would have to wait unbridged. The family was more important then either of them. It it, as a whole needed his complete attention.~<br><br>"I keep hearing rumors, mummers that Dane is going to be disbanded. That it should be let to die. If we can not all come together regardless of what we do here it will happen. It is said, "Talk is cheap." Well why can't we seem to afford it? We pass each other in silence afraid the breath from our words will knock each other down. We are grown men and women here, we've all fought terrible and glorious battles, and seen each other on the other side. Talk to one another, find out what it is that makes your brother's and sisters your family."<br><br>"Right now, I want to hear what should happen to our little family. Many of my officers are not here, or are remaining silent."<br><br>"As more people show up for this meeting we will welcome them and continue. If people depart, we will wish them well, and continue. WE WILL CONTINUE UNTIL WE FIGURE SOMTHING OUT." ~Desperate shouted the words. The volume of his voice was not brought out by anger soley, or excietment by itself. It was a mixture of everything building. The hostilities that are felt everyday in the Dane manor, the excitement that peeks when a family member reaches a new level of thier training.~<br><br>"Right now, Druuni and Stonedane are not with us. I hope Lluedane will find them soon, and they will make thier way. Until then I want to hear from my officers that are here."<br><br>~Desperate walked towards Grimace.~ "Grim, you have shown your loyality to Dane on many occassions. You have seen alot of the happenings in the everyday life of this family. I want to hear from you. Tell me, as a Dane, as an officer, as a friend and as a brother. What do you see that needs to be done? You've remained silent through most of this ordeal. Now is the time for you to find your voice."<br><br>~Desperate awaited an answer.~ <br><br>Deep Thoughts From a Shallow Mind<br>--Desperate Measures<br>Guild Leader of<br>The Hand Of Dane<br><br><br><br>width="388" height="154"&gt;<br><br><br><br><br> <br>  <br><br> RE: Time Moves On Waiting For No One <br><br>User Options:  Edit Message <br> <br>      Druuni<br>Posted On 07/01/01 06:04AM <br><br><br>*Boooooom!*<br><br>~a huge bright red flash fills the sky above the people gathered in a small circle. Even Topa's face becomes visible for a short second, before all the people instantly ducks from something falling down from above. The campfire explodes and spreads smoke and ashes in a big cloud as something lands forcefully in the middle of it. A few seconds of silence. Then a young voice starts whining desperatly from within the smokecloud<br><br>"Eeeeech! Help! Help! I'm on fire! Water please, fast! ..."<br>"Lleudane?" Desperate utters, a bit confused.<br><br>"Ooops, sorry! Didnt mean to drop him right there...hehe"<br><br>~The Greater Wolf grins as she slowly levels down towards the ground. Sniffing a bit to recognize who is there, she jumps to the left and bites something hidden in the shadows in the leg (a rogue yells in pain), before she finds a spot in the ring around the fire.<br><br>"Ahh..that was some trip...

She did not wish to be there longer than necessary. But before she was ready to depart Wynndane arrived. Acting shocked at her feelings of distrust and feigning misunderstanding of her anger.<br><br>"You still don't get it do you? Either that or you choose to ignore the LITTLE fact. You say Macdane and yourself supported me, yet Justinn was the one to cut me down when I was unavailable to defend myself or even retort? I say this, Macdane was the first Dane I ever met. I was but in my twelfth season when we joined together in the Northern Desert of Ro. Whether the words come from Macdane, Justin, or from you, the come from the same soul. The same mind. The same spirit. You cannot deny this, and you cannot hide from this truth. Claim your innoncence all you want, many, many see through your deceptions and half truths. You are known to speak out of anger in one persona and quickly don another and apologize for yourself as a means of damage control. THAT is why my love and respect for you is forever lost. It is one thing to say such things TO an individual, but not behind their back. If you can't understand that, well, you truly are lost for Marr has forsaken you. And for THAT, and that alone would I pity you." <br><br>Glaring at Wynndane, she gently tapped Desperate reassuringly on his knee, she altered her form to resemble her sister wolf. With a final snarl at Wynndane she left those that remained in awestruck silence. She heard Desperate release the large breath he was holding as he spoke "And that's why I call her Dynomite ..."<br><br>Before anyone else spoke, Myssi shouted "Remember Wynndane, one piece of Wisdom that all the Wise should know ... It is easier to forgive an enemy than a friend."<br><br>/ooc Wynddane, you know EXACTLY what I'm talking about.

Several times he has reached for his bags to bring him his luck and happiness but felt the time was not right to begin that just yet. Red in the face after hearing the latest exchanges, he leaps upon his chair and gives a scowl to all.<br><br>"Enough, me says! All I kin see 'bove this table be fingers pointin an hearts wantin to cry. I din' come 'ere ta listin ta bickerin. We solve nothin by keepin this up. In my bag 'ere be presents fer ya all, ta lighten ya up!"<br><br>~Raising his bag with a flourish, he pulls out many brown bottles with xxx for their labels. Jumping down from his seat, he places a bottle in front of all. For the clerics, he takes out two slender bottles and places it before them. Placing a napkin under each bottle, while trying to hide the disdain from his face. When done he hops back on his chair.<br><br>"Dwarf Spirits fer ya all, an red wine fer da holys. Tis now time ta lighten our moods an move on. No more talk of da glory. No more talk o da past. Let us speak o our direction forward, for that be the wishes o us all. I bin seein more Danes than before, even grouped fer battle wit some. This be our start fer things ta come. Let us continue what's bin started a bit more! We all can feel it. Drink ta this!" He raises his bottle. "LET DIS BE DA BEGINNING!!!"<br><br>~Plopping down in his seat, Xaneth hurrieldy gulps down the contents of his bottle of dwarf spirits and smiles. "BUUURP!" He reaches into his second bag and produces another bottle. From the clanking sounds, more bottles can be heard from within, but with each passing minute, the clanks can be heard less and less as there was always a bottle within Xaneth's hands. <br><br> <br>  <br><br> RE: Crossroads <br><br> <br>      mrbreeze6<br>Posted On 07/02/01 10:06AM <br><br><br>*downs his dwarfs spirits, in hurry*<br><br>"i agree."<br><br>*belches loudly* <br><br>solux<br><br>Message Edited on 07/02/01 09:59AM by mrbreeze6  <br>  <br><br> RE: Crossroads <br><br>User Options:  Edit Message <br> <br>      Druuni<br>Posted On 07/02/01 01:28PM <br><br><br>:howls towards Xaneth!<br><br>"You spoke my heart brother...and many many others too I am to believe!

It's eyes turn all white:<br><br>"You two... ...rrrr..you... Lets me just for a second BITE yer necks off and let you see yourselves from a distance. See to your SOULS. Which one is taller than the the other? Which one is closest to touch the sky? NEITHER ONE!!!! From where I see they are actually not even reaching up to my pawtips right now. They seem to be holding eachother down, one hitting the other and lowering itself just as much as it hits. And allthough I remember it very well; Right now I dont give a wooly mammothshyt about what happened back at that time!!! The way you both act right NOW is what affect us all!

Wynd had said The rogue had known him for a long time perhaps the cleric should use some of his insightfullness &amp; think about that. After all someone who knows a person that well &amp; feels betrayed may not be all wrong. Yet wyndane was himself short tempered. Instead of thinking about remarks made towards him he simply responded. Letting sleeping dogs lie, Topa then began to wonder why the dog bit him. Topa had a way with animals &amp; they were usually as friendly towards him as any druid. The rogue just sat &amp; puffed on his Cigar listening to the conversations around him. He heard the cleric say long live dane. Is that really what Dane needs?? a long life?? if so does it need to be changed? how so? So manny questions &amp; the answers don't seem to be getting any closer. But at least the rogue found this guild more interesting scince his brothers loss of sanity. <br><br>~Topasere~<br>~To steal from the rich &amp; give to the poor means to be poor &amp; steal untill you become Rich!!~<br><br>p&gt;<br><br><br><br><br><br> <br>  <br><br> hidden in shadows nearby... <br><br> <br>      Tryzen<br>Posted On 07/03/01 04:30AM <br><br><br>Dujinn watched the gathering of people with interest. Occasionally glancing at the parchment rolled up in his hands, he wondered how to get it to the Tall barbarian without interrupting everyone. The passion he witnessed was definately inspiring to say the least. <br>Remembering the previous few days beginning when Lord Tryzen had pressed the parchment into his hands, he began to understand what had brought his mood swing.<br>"Take this Dujinn. Find Desperate and give it to him. He'll be the crafted barbarian warrior leader of Dane." <br>"Yes my lord. But why not send a messenger?" Dujinn questioned.<br>"A messenger i would not trust with that letter. You, my knight of the shadows, have a much better chance to deliver it in case someone seeks to stop you."<br>"It shall be as you say Tryzen." Dujinn saluted as he stepped into the shadows.<br>He stayed and watched Tryzen from the shadows. Watched him turn back to the window and gaze at the sunset. Dujinn thought he heard Tryzen whisper something that sounded like "All will be well, it has to."<br>His journey eventually brought him to Dane Manor. Twitching his nose at the rancid smell of smoke he looked upon the building which seemed to be deserted.<br>Sticking to the shadows he wandered through the halls.<br>"well it doesn't seem that the manor was attacked." Dujinn thought to himself.<br>He stopped at the entrance to a great hall and looked at the broken door. Noticing the remnants of a fire in the middle of the room, he shook his head and continued his exploration. Wandering around the Manor from the shadows and not finding anyone there was disturbing. The loud creak of a door startled him and he noticed a young elven lass enter another room further down.<br>"sometimes i think i should have been a rogue" dujinn thought to himself as he watched the young elven woman, a warrior by the look of her weapons, start to undress. Seeing her naked brought a smirk to his face but didn't quite distract him enough from hearing her mumble about getting ready for the meeting in Butchers block. Dujinn smiled about learning the whereabouts of desperate. He planned his escape before she could turn from her bath when a knock on the door froze him in place.<br>She wrapped herself up in a robe and opened the door. Her eyes lit up and a smile came to her face, "Hey, you!"<br><br>The sound of breaking glass pulled him from his memory and despite himself he smiled as he remembered escaping that room. Checking out the new arrivals and noticing a possible fight breaking out between that large breasted druid and that slim cleric, he contemplated a way to the barbarian.<br>Checking the letter again he started to move closer to the group. <br><br>Tryzen Tru'Hael<br>55th Templar of Reverant<br>Cleric of Tunare<br><br><br><br>Message Edited on 07/26/01 04:03PM by Tryzen  <br>  <br><br> RE: hidden in shadows nearby... <br><br> <br>      Lluedane<br>Posted On 07/03/01 05:36AM <br><br><br>::Finding Druuni proved the most difficult. For as Llue could outrun most of the other Dane, Druuni had a habbit of forever moving from place to place in the blink of an eye.:: Damned be the druids and thier teleports. Don't trust it, don't trust nothing that moves faster then I run. ::And run he did, pounding on his Mistmoore drums, a gift from Desperate and Rhyden. Llue seemed to Cirlce Antonica three times, crossed the Ocean of Tears at least a dozen times, and by his calculations visited the acursed Kunark more times then he would care to remember. He did however avoid Odus, no self respecting minstrel would lower himself to visiting a island practically ruled by the cats and dogs. Rediculious if you asked him, which no one ever did. When he finally caught up with Druuni, she was in her wolf form. And Katch up he had to, she definatly gave him a run for his money. He wished he had a ball, then all he would have to do is throw it and she would bring it back. Then he could muzzle the little mutt.:: Desperate wants all his Danes, especially the officers at the Butcherblock cross roads.:: Llue screamed out. Druuni stopped so quickly he almost tripped over the bag of fur. The bard would have collapsed out of breath had he not been afraid she would cover his face with licks. In her usual form this wouldn't be such a bad thought, but as she was now, she was a real dog. Druuni cocked her head. Lluedane spoke slowly so the intelectually impaired dog could understand him.:: Butch.....er.....block.....Meet..ing.....for.....all....Danes. ::Had he not been trying to insult the dog's intellignece he might have notice her beginning to cast a spell. As it was her was still mouthing the words when they vanished. <br><br> <br>  <br><br> Onward To Battle <br><br> <br>      Desdmona<br>Posted On 07/04/01 05:22AM <br><br><br>~Desdmona departed her ship her head still reeling form her encounter with the Man of knowing as she called him. So much had happened to her in a few short days. She has had the past revealed to her and her present is unknown.<br>~She smiles a short smile of satisfaction tho......in her knowing she is positave that Dane will be okay. She isnt sure how but there is a comfort inside her breast.~<br>Joining Aerimus together they prepare for battle against more Forsaken.......The Dark Legioneers..........<br>~In the process of dressing they chat of her trip.~<br>~" So has your family finally ripped themselves to shreds?" Aerimus asked rather confidently. " No and they wont I am sure. I have encounted some rather interesting people in my trip home. I have visited Telhrod."<br>" You went to the Dreamwalkers?" As astonishment crossed Aerimus'es face. His wife never ceased to amaze him, her being a dark elf and all. " What did you learn?"<br>" Several things, my Dear, most important is that my family will survive this test of them. One way or another Hand Of Dane will live. In one form or another we will all survive this test."<br>~ Smirking, she added, " and that soon my Husband I shall also bear you a Son." <br>~ Aerimus seemed to be pleased and left it at that as he watched his beloved dress carefully for the battle ahead.~<br>" Please stay back when we fight. I dont want you running in there like a banshee. You possess to much of Desperate's foolish Barbarian ways. I fear they will get you killed. You are a Rouge.........ACT like one!!"<br>~" Foolish Man........my real father WAS a Barbarian. I cannot help what is in my blood."<br>~ Gasping, Aerimus shakes his head in befuddlement." How can this be?? You are beautifull, intelligent and dark skinned. How can you be of that ignorant stock??"<br>~ Desdmona laughed~ " Our Gods work in strange ways. Who is to say that the son I bear you wont have the same looks as his grandfather..........Lan Mandragon??"<br>" Now Dear we must go to battle. The Knights await us. Dont worry about me..I shall listen and do as you say."<br>~ Aerimus worried about his wife......she seemed so strange since she returned. He had heard that when you go to the land of the Dreamwalkers you never come back the same. He feared she was going to do something reckless like that crazy Barbarian stepfather she has choosen. He likes Desprate, but he thought him to be slightly off the beam.<br>~ Silently he prayed to Bristlebane for her safety as they rode onward to battle.<br><br>Desdmona<br><br><br> <br>  <br><br> RE: Onward To Battle <br><br> <br>      Topasere<br>Posted On 07/04/01 01:42PM <br><br><br>::Desdmona hears the whispering of a hidden rogue:: "I hope for his sake your more like your step father than your uncle. You ncle would rune s spear through some non vital part of him just to hit the enemy one the other side." ::Topa smirked &amp; started his return trip to the Butcher Block Mountains:: <br><br>~Topasere~<br>~To steal from the rich &amp; give to the poor means to be poor &amp; steal untill you become Rich!!~<br><br>p&gt;<br><br><br><br><br><br> <br>  <br><br> RE: Onward To Battle <br><br> <br>      Xaneth<br>Posted On 07/04/01 02:41PM <br><br><br>~Xaneth looks around the table with a huge smile upon his lips. He has taken pride knowing that he has done a bit of good for all. There are actual smiles upon people's faces and the wagging of a tail in the wolf's case. Holding the table for balance he stands upon his chair.<br><br>"Fellow Danes, ish good fer ush all a be 'ere. I wanna make a shuggestion. Twould be good ta adventure wit you all from time ta time. I would like ta shtart a new tradition fer us. I wanna call the fifth work day o da week, Dane day. On dat day we should try an adventure shomewhere together. I am sure we kin get a few ports so all kin make it. I kin vouch fer Llweth, an he'd be happy ta git anyone. We kin go wherever ya needs o wants."<br><br>~Xaneth moves his wobbly body and takes his seat once more. He pulls two coins from his puch and slams them upon the table. "Well there goes me two coppers", he says to himself, while grabbing a bottle of Dwarf Spirits. <br><br> <br>  <br><br> RE: Crossroads <br><br> <br>      mrbreeze6<br>Posted On 07/04/01 08:12PM <br><br><br>*stands from his seat*<br><br>"ive noticed alot of you are quiet, maybe thinking of how we will rebuild that manor, and i say worry bout that not!"<br><br>" it is being done as we speak!"<br><br>*takes a drag off his pipe*<br><br>"after desperate tolf me to leave, i figures i could do something usefull by sending my finest craftsmen and slaves form my city-state of felwithe (yes thats MY CASTLE) in greater faydark, to rebuild the manor to be exact as it was beofore"<br><br>"Now lets talk about how we can make dane better and greater peaple*<br><br>*takes a puff and takes his seat*<br><br>solux <br><br> <br>  <br><br> In a place unseen by mortal eyes <br><br> <br>      SylverMetalsmyt<br>Posted On 07/04/01 09:00PM <br><br><br>"PLACE YOUR BETS, PLACE YOUR BETS!"<br><br>Sylverdane's eyes snap open. He smelled money.<br><br>Centerseat, the roulette wheel spinning round and round, the dealer?.....something that looked like a walking turd.<br><br>"Last chance to place your bet, Dane", Cazic Thule said with a dripping smile.<br><br>"Mind if I smoke?" Sylver asked, taking out a half chewed cigar. Ten ghostly hands with thumbs afire rushed to his service. Sylver inhaled sharply, and the cigar was aflame.<br><br>"Black 11" Sylver said.<br><br>"How much, Sylver?" Cazic asked.<br><br>In Sylverdane's mind flashed several complicated and hazy shapes.....a barbarian bleeding, a cleric killing, a blonde angel wandering aimlessly, searching. A thousand other shapes and memories with no form.<br><br>"All of it." he murmured.<br><br>Cazic looked startled. "All of it?"<br><br>"Aye, all of it."<br><br>"I'll need to speak to the boss on this one." Cazic looked concerned, as concerned as a walking feces could look. He pressed a button under the table.<br><br>The Boss. Sylver thought. Damned, why is that so familiar?<br><br>Innoruuk stomped his dark and pestilant form across the casino. "some problem here?" he wheezed.<br><br>"Um, Dane wants to bet it all." Cazic almost sounded apologetic.<br><br>"ALL of it?" Innoruuk asked. Sylver merely nodded.<br><br>"They will not accept you if you come back." Innoruuk said warningly.<br><br>"I am not coming back to be accepted" Sylver replied, exhaling.<br><br>"They do not know you."<br><br>"They will"<br><br>"They will not respect you."<br><br>"Perhaps"<br><br>"some will chose to try to kill you."<br><br>Sylver laughed. "Some have ALWAYS tried to kill me....I mean, this is Rallos....=p"<br><br>Innoruuk frowned. "Do you know what you are doing?....Your body lies motionless in front of that bitch Tunare. But your soul is here, in a casino, yours to visit whenever you want. You have it all here"<br><br>"I donot have one thing, Inny"<br><br>Innoruuk moved to strike Sylverdane at that disrespectful nickname, but then chuckled.<br><br>"WHAT. What don't you have that I can't provide?" He laughed deep, and the casino's dead, decayed patrons chuckled with him.<br><br>"Family." Sylver answered simply.<br><br>Silence.<br><br>"Fine!" Innoruuk exploded. "ALL of it!...." His manner calmed. "The rules...if you win, I devise a quest for your so called "Family" to bring you back. If *I* win...Emaus is mine, and you stay here, and watch her wait tables, and then dance on them, for my and Cazic's delight. You will see her dancing with madness in her eyes...eyes blind to see you, ears deaf to your screams as you descend into eternal insanity....forever watching your "mouse" run through a maze of my design. Do you still wish to spin?"<br><br>A thought of a guildgiveaway from many moons ago crosses Sylver's mind<br><br>"Roll" he says quietly.<br><br>Cazic mouths "The switch?" to Innoruuk, who only nods curtly. Unseen by Sylver's eyes, Cazic switches a lever under the table.<br><br>And the wheel spins.<br><br>"Summon air pet" Sylver murmurs to himself with a twitch of his cigar. Unseen by the crown, an invisible elemental forms.<br><br>Red black red black red black<br><br>round and round<br><br>black red black red<br><br>slower the wheel turns<br><br>red black red black 12 36 15 3 11 9 24<br><br>2 00 33 14 8 11<br><br>18 16 29<br><br>11<br><br>2<br><br>the ball teeters<br><br>/pet bump table<br><br>"11 WINNER!" calls Cazic, caught up in it all.<br><br>"I'll take that in cash" Sylver says softly, and stubs out his cigar.<br><br>And somewhere near the back of the casino, an elemental disperses...<br><br><br><br> <br>  <br><br> RE: In a place unseen by mortal eyes <br><br> <br>      Multar88<br>Posted On 07/04/01 11:11PM <br><br><br>coming back from bluebie server?<br><br>Multar Ownzyou <br>36 paladin <br>MASTER BADAZZZ <br><br> <br>  <br><br> RE: In a place unseen by mortal eyes <br><br> <br>      Xaneth<br>Posted On 07/04/01 11:22PM <br><br><br>OOC: Good ta 'ere from ya Sylver.

He wonders why the strain in the talk. He wonders why the issues at hand have affected his brothers and sisters so strongly. He can feel the sadness, he can sense the rage. Thinking back to when he joined the guild, he remembers how happy all seemed to be. He also remembers when he checked to see who all was on most of the time the list was so long that it was impossible to be listed. He ponders why he joined this guild, why he tryed so hard for weeks to be accepted into it. Then of the feelings that flooded his mind when at last he was accepted to be part of this great family.<br><br>Was it the size of the guild? Was it the power of the guild? Could it have been the harmony that was appearent to his keen wolf awareness of it's members? Nay! Not one of these things was the most important. It was the feeling of it all as a whole. Along with the vast respect that so many travelers he came apon had for Hand of Dane. This was not "just" a guild. It was an idea that spread it's self across the lands of the world. The very strength of the guild was it's legend. A guild strong of character, a guild that was based on the efforts of many for one common goal. After meeting serveral members of this family and traveling with them while hunting and merry making and sleeping with them at their campfire, he knew that this would be his family if he could prove to them his worthyness. Now after what seems like only fleeting seconds many fear that the family is falling apart.<br><br>Agresser casts a spell and prepares to make the long journey to the halls of Dane. He knows all to well of his part in this. He knows that he must make his leader understand that what he had is not lost. That the family he is a part of is still strong, for the light shines bright as ever across the lands in the words of travelers and in the actions of Danes themselves. We can't undo what is not undone, we can strive to continue making each day yet another day's greatness for our family. To make sure our actions and deeds pass from the words of all whom we come across. The truth is that one Dane or one thousand Danes will still shine as bright on the land if their deeds and actions are talked about at the campfires of those we come across on our journeys.<br><br>Agresser Wolfheart<br>Proud member of <br>Hand of Dane<br><br><br><br> <br>  <br><br> Reesey was half asleep when she had an erie feeling she was being watched. <br><br> <br>      Ilaenu<br>Posted On 07/06/01 07:37AM <br><br><br>She let a few moments go bye, thinking it was only her nerves recovering from the long and drawn out day. The warrior's "feeling" then changed to "knowing" that she was being watched.<br>"Show yourself magic user," warned Reesey as she sprung from her bedding. <br>A laughter came from the shadows, "Sister, you never cease to amaze me." Ilaenu appeared out of nowhere.<br>A smile came to the beaten warrior's face, "Tis good to see you sister, it's been a long time."<br>"Aye, it has," replied Ilaenu<br>"You fly no flags now?"<br>A distant look came across Ilaenu's face as she muttered, "No, Once again I have no home."<br>"Care to talk to about it?"<br>Ilaenu answered, "I'd rather not."<br>"I'm sure Desperate would welcome you back to Hand of Dane, if you asked," said Reesey.<br>"I'm waiting for something to happen...I have this feeling that someone from our past is about to..."

Just then, Reesey got a nervous twitch and she looked around. "Hmm..," she thought to herself. Her gaze scanned the neighboring trees, she knew someone was watching...but she couldn't pinpoint where the watcher was hidden. She leaned forward and whispered in Desperate's ear, "M'lord, I have that twitch all of a sudden."<br>"Aye Darlin, I've just picked up on one myself."

Awakening <br><br> <br>      RudraWhiteknght<br>Posted On 07/08/01 09:05PM <br><br><br>~ A soft strand of smoke, travels across a small farmstead, as a boy tends the sheep, leading them to a far field... ~<br><br>"That smells of...", Kao's voice cracking in fear.<br><br>Kao darted for the stables, leaping upon Cortez, and set out as fast as he could, for the Cavern of the Dead.<br><br>"I know I'll find you father.." Kao spoke as his horse galloped off into the mists.<br><br>-=The Awakening=- <br><br> <br>  <br><br> RE: Crossroads <br><br> <br>      follosekker<br>Posted On 07/09/01 01:33AM <br><br><br>OOC: Please dont let any typos etc in my posting take u off the topic. I didnt have a spell checker available when I wrote this.<br><br>In the druid circle a body materializes. The old druid Follo seems content to what he sees  familiar trees, grass and hills. At his 52 season he has just returned from the largest and most mindblowing experience of his life. But as he materializes the knowledge he just thought he had, somehow seems to slip away. The only thought he seems to be able to hold on to, the only thought that somehow seems related to the journey he just finished is: This is not the only existence there is  there are others. And spirits can travel between them.<br>I must try to teach my knowledge to my fellow Danes. My dear brother and sisters.<br><br>He starts running in the direction of crossroads on his way to Kaladim, not knowing the large meeting taking place there at just this moment.<br><br>Closing in he sees there is a large gathering there, and suddenly sees old familiar faces and several new ones. He even sees faces not seen for a long time.<br><br>Hail Danes Follo says in a normal voice. Not everyone hears his salute, but as Desperate turns and hails Follo with a smile, he is greeted by all his family.<br><br>After a short introduction to the background for this meeting Follo is able to see that Desperate has been thru a hard trial. He also notices that his old friend Wynddane seems worn somehow.<br><br>Feeling that its expected he says something, Follo steps into the middel of the circle, seems to be thinking for a short while then starts speaking:<br><br>"Dear family  see around u, what do you see? Brothers and sisters from both the present and from times past.<br>Some of you spend your time thinking about the past, some of you spend your time planning the future, I say: First and foremost spend your time enjoying the present. Its here and now you can act! Its now you can make friends. Its now u can help others and gain glory. Its now you can feel joy or pain."<br><br>Glugg, glugg. Follo drinks from his bottle to clear his voice.<br><br>"Remeber our gods have mercy on us. When we die, we come alive again. My only concern is that of beeing robbed when dead. Makes me mad! Cause I have never partisipated in those acts, except when it comes to killing scum that have troubled me or my friends in the past."<br><br>Follo takes a break, hugging a small tree nearby. Then he continues:<br><br>"So there is actually no reason why we should not just be a happy family.<br>I support Desperate, and I enjoy my friendship with Wynddane and Druuni. I thank Myssi for the good advices conserning me going to Burning Woods for Hornet hunting. Lets enjoy!"<br><br>Follo feels he have spoken too long. So he concludes:<br><br>"And of cause we must recruit. There are several very nice people out there. Lets consentrate on the unguilded. We dont like when our brothers and sisters leave us to join another guild. So we must expect the same feelings arise in other guilds too, If we sort of steal their members.<br>But if we consentrate on the unguilded, we wont generate such problems."<br><br>Follo steps back and sits down.<br><br>Suddenly a Bright White light came from the Norrath Sky hitting Wynddane in the chest and almost knocking the Slayer of Vox on his back. Supported by Desperate he mutters something about a quest.<br><br>Hmm, whats this Follo thinks. <br><br><br><br><br> <br>  <br><br> RE: Awakening <br><br> <br>      RudraWhiteknght<br>Posted On 07/09/01 03:27AM <br><br><br>~Kao's horse, exhausted from hours of a feverish pace, stumbles to the ground, unable to move any longer. Springing off the fallen steed, Kao takes great strides, that would remind any folk of his Elven lineage, up the well worn pathway. His every footstep striking lightning like energy through his spine.~<br><br>"Where is that .." Kao mummured.<br><br>His stride slowed, as the brown moss clung to his father's old boots, and he came to a stop upon a lush green hill. Gazing as far as he could, he spotted the mound. It would appear quite common to most peoples that travel in these parts... just a weathered hill in a valley of many.. but Kao knew better than most people. In a circle of stones stood a pillar of Valorium, hidden from all but the truest of heart.<br><br>Kao quickly ran towards the hill, as if all of hell's furies were at his heels. He reached the green hill, and caught himself on a moss covered rock. Crawling towards the Valorium pillar, Kao uttered the prayer taught to him by this mother. He clutched his medallion... and for a moment, all things in the world fell silent.<br><br>A sharp wind blew from the Eastern mountains.. "A storm, or.." wondered Kao. He quickly made a camp before his exhaustion got the better of him. Kao laid his head down upon the soft ground, and glanced over his shoulder at the Valorium pillar, and the mountains to the East, ever blowings winds colder than Halas itself.<br><br><br><br>-=The Awakening=- <br><br> <br>  <br><br> RE: Awakening <br><br> <br>      RudraWhiteknght<br>Posted On 07/09/01 03:46AM <br><br><br>~The lingering embers in the hearth in the Great Hall of Dane burn slowly while Desperate, Leader of Dane, sleeps deeply in a heavy sweat.<br><br>A distant thunderclap awakens him from his nightmare in a startle, as his grabs for his sword, only then realizing it was all a dream. The winds of Halas blow open the great wooden doors to his hall, while the outside guards hastily try to keep them closed. Picking his massive frame off of his throne, Desperate slides over to the doors, extending his tree trunk arms, and slamming the open doors shut.<br><br>"That should be the end of tha.." muttered Desperate before his senses perked. Something was wrong, he could smell it.<br><br>Staring across the great hall, the fire in the great hearth was burning like the furnaces of Solusek itself.<br><br>"What magic this be?!" rumbled Desperate.<br><br>Unblinkly, Desperate stared in disbelief as a great frame rose out of the long burned ashes, taking shape. He could hardly control himself. With a tremendous thunderclap, not likely to ever be heard again, the frame flew across the great hall, and smashed itself into the think stone walls of the fortress.<br><br>Rubbing his eyes in disbelief, Desperate slowly stumbled over to the wall, avoiding the flames slowing dying out on his floor. Staring up at the new portrait on his wall, he soon recognized the once discarded and long hung painting risen from the ashes...<br><br>He promptly fainted.<br><br><br><br>-=The Awakening=-<br><br><br> <br>  <br><br> FALLING <br><br> <br>      DesperateMeasur<br>Posted On 07/11/01 10:01AM <br><br><br>~The bickering between Dynomite and Wynddane started to make Desperate's head spin. The crowd seemed larger then it had. Desperate felt surrounded. So many faces, so many voices. Always more to do, can't stop. Desperate's mind was weary, his head was splitting.~<br><br>~A scream~<br><br>~Desperate shook his head as it felt it split in two. Looking for the source of the scream. Lluedane fell towards the ground like a meteor from the sky. He howled as he hit the ground. Desperate raises his hands trying to quiet the world and slow it down for a moment. Somthing seemed wrong. He flashed back on his last visit to the tribunal's court, and judgement. Impending doom from the heavens. Falling down fast.~<br><br>~Desperate shook his head, shaking off the weariness and sence of impending doom. Nothing was falling. Nothing was wrong or different with the world. A wolf growled, at Wynd and Myssi, then turned at snapped at thin air. Desperate heard his brother's gasp. Though more out of shock then pain.~<br><br>~To comotion going on around him seemed to have everyone's attention as well. He could neither focus on anyone, nor look away. His mind spun again. Falling disaster, things to come, things to change. Desperate shook his head again.~ "Nothing's falling." ~No one appeared to hear him. His hand still rested on Grimace's shoulder. The paladin hadn't responded. Apparently sencing the change in Desperate's mood more then anyone.~<br><br>~The warrior released his friends shoulder and stepped to the table, where Xaneth handed out a few drinks. Desperate downed a bottle trying to calm his sences. He hadn't had a drink since his visit with his Daughter. One would do him good. Desperate paused. How long ago was that visit? How long had we all gathered here? Had the gods stopped time for the Danes? Stopped the world for us to decide its fate? Does Norrath belong to the wicked and greedy? Or will Dane save it? Will Dane stand or fall?~<br><br>Fall? Looking up at the sky again, it was easy for Desperate to believe that the stars looked down awaiting the decision on the fate of the world. The stars on the edge of thier seats looking down. What if one fell from its seat to get a closer look? Falling. Again Desperate shook his head. His vision swam.~<br><br>~Red, balck, red, black, red, black. Firey, burnt. Burning, charred. Falling fire. Impending destruction. Red, black, red, black, red, black.~ <br><br>Deep Thoughts From a Shallow Mind<br>--Desperate Measures<br>Guild Leader of<br>The Hand Of Dane<br><br><br><br>width="388" height="154"&gt;<br><br><br><br><br> <br>  <br><br> The Darkness of Ignorance <br><br> <br>      DesperateMeasur<br>Posted On 07/11/01 10:04AM <br><br><br>~~Sylverdane sat on the shore of the North and South Karanas border, looking out over the river, smoking a half smoked cigar. To his right stood a camp full of bandits, who were standing very still hoping the guildleader of the Hand of Dane would not notice them. They were less afraid of him then they were of the hulking, huge earth Elemental, Kenn, hovering next to him. It was Sylver's birthday, and he was awaiting his wife Emaus, who was due to port in and take them away for a quiet romantic dinner somewhere in the Ice Lands.~~<br><br>~Again Desperate shook his head and the world swam out of focus. Was today Sylverdane's birthday? No that was earlier in the year. Why did that thought crash into his brain like a hammer? The guildleader of Hand of Dane? No Desperate was the leader, Desperate had taken the reins behind the Lord Sylver. Desperate's arm began to throb.~<br><br>~~Sylver's arm begins to throb. He pondered all the plans for Dane, especially the long awaited and never implemented Dane Casino. How he loved the roulette wheel. Spinning round...red...black...red black.... His arm goes numb. FLASH through his mind--<br><br>RED....that first time a puma took him down in East Commons, Wynd already down beside him.<br>BLACK...the first piece of black iron, a bracer, he camped for his brother Riverdane, that would earn River the name Riverdane Blackrazor.<br>Pain shoots like poison up his arm.<br>RED....The sun behind Topasere's face as it sets, a coin in Sylver's hand and a snake fang in Topas, when a business deal turned into a friendship.~~<br><br>~Desperate shook his arm, discarding the pain and throwing it to the ground like a Dead weight. Wynddane was muttering to himself, for Dane for Dane. What was he trying to say? Desperate had realized that he hadn't heard anyone's voice. The world had stopped. What was going on? Falling. In his mind's eye he saw a meteor bouncing on a roulette wheel.~<br><br>~~BLACK...A night with Emaus in front of Sol B, when he bumped into her and invited her to River's wedding.<br>Fire ripping through his veins.<br>RED...Rudra and Sylver walking away from the Aviac House in SK, dripping with the remains of the fight that afforded him level 22....<br>BLACK...the darkness right before Alexios gave him his first Ressurection...<br>RED...The color now flashing before Sylver's eyes as the heart attack hits him full force...<br>and then<br>BLACK....Black....black...~~<br><br>~Desperate scratched his chest. The pain slowing again. Throbbing inside, now calming. Maybe he was crazy. He didn't feel crazy. His thoughts and images were crisp and sharp. He just couldn't understand them. Maybe that was insanity, being the only one who doesn't know how off you are.~<br><br>~Ilaenu's mouth moved. His eyes focused. She was beautiful. Desperate nodded to what she said. What did she say? He heard her, he had understood her. But now he was blank. What just happened? What was happening. No one appeared to see his confusion. He felt outside himself. Looking around. Falling. He fought the visions and sounds, the world that strove to break free from his mind.~<br><br>~Desperate dropped his cigar as pain exploded through his torso. Ripping like the burning fires that erruped from a wizards chant. Acid from a Necromancer's tormented incantation.~<br><br>~~A cigar falls from a twisted hand.<br><br>A man fall to the floor.<br><br>Words escape his lips...."Things are...desperate"<br><br>Afterwards, after Emaus in a state found him barely alive, and had carried him off to be tended under Wynd's hand, she returned with Rudra, where Kenn stood silently, still staring out at the water.<br><br>"Did he say anything?" she asked tearfully. "What should we do with the guild while he heals?...did he say anything at all?"<br><br>Kenn stared at her passively, stonily.<br><br>She turns to go.<br><br>"Desperate". Kenn croaked.<br><br>"Desperate?" Rudra said, eyebrow raised.<br><br>"You heard him." Emaus told Rudra, preparing to port. "Sylver said 'Get Desperate'."<br>And as they port away...<br><br>...an earth elemental named Kenn smiles, chuckles, and picks up a half smoked cigar, blowing smoke over the water.~~<br><br>~Contrary to the popular belief Desperate's mind was strong. Even as he doubted it himself. The visions bestowed on him were images of the past. Desperate would have realized this had he not listened to every's doubt of his sanity. Had he himself not doubted it. He wouldn't have fought the visions but embraced them as the Shamans had taught him. But his need to stay clear headed made him doubt. His feirce desire to prove to all, including himself made him fight. Fight off the vision. His mind was straining now as he battled off the messages from the gods. The messages from time. He had been awarded the wisdom of the past.~<br><br>~Falling from the sky. Impending disaster.~ "Nothing's falling!" Desperate's shout was heard in the world of the past, and snapped him back to the present even as he understood what was being shown to him. He took his control back. The world no longer spun, the acid no longer swept through his veins. Desperate quietly cursed his ignorance. Someone wanted to tell him somthing. But he had told them to shut up. He was shown the past, but before the future could be explained, or even the present he closed his mind severing the link.~<br><br><br>Deep Thoughts From a Shallow Mind<br>--Desperate Measures<br>Guild Leader of<br>The Hand Of Dane<br><br><br><br>width="388" height="154"&gt;<br><br><br><br><br> <br>  <br><br> Asleep in the world <br><br> <br>      DesperateMeasur<br>Posted On 07/11/01 10:05AM <br><br><br>~The world seemed suddenly normal. Where had the message gone? Desperate looked up. Nothing loomed from the sky. Nothing threatened to fall, nothing tried to crush him. As in the court of the Tribunal he again stepped into the darkness. The darkness of ignorance.~<br><br>~Wynddane was muttering to himself again. Desperate couldn't make out what he was saying. His mind clear. His ears opened. Desperate watched his brother stand, dazed and turn to leave again.~<br><br>~What the hell had happend while he was lost? The message from the gods didn't seem half as important as a word from the family expaling what he had missed.~ "Wynd! Where are you going?" ~The cleric didn't hear him or ignored him. Desperate crossed through the meeting, all eyes drawn on Wynd. This trance was not normal. The gods had deemed it impossible for the enchanters to take control of a man with spells. They had changed that long ago, so why was Wynd under someone elses control? Walking in a daze? Talking to himself.~<br><br>~Desperate looked around for Topa. That damned rogue better not be disrupting things with his jokes. Desperate gripped Wynddane's shoulder.~<br><br>~RED, BLACK, RED, BLACK, RED, BLACK....~<br><br>~DOOM FROM ABOVE. FALLING.~<br><br>~Desperate picked up a residue of the vision Wynddane was seeing. The vision Desperate had fought. When severed from Desperate the link to the gods slammed into the only other man as close to Sylver as Desperate. Wynd.~<br><br>~FALLING.~<br><br>~The warning flashed again. But too late. Fire, blindingly white covered Wynd and Desperate, cutting the two apart. Sending them flying in two seperate directions.~<br><br><br>Deep Thoughts From a Shallow Mind<br>--Desperate Measures<br>Guild Leader of<br>The Hand Of Dane<br><br><br><br>width="388" height="154"&gt;<br><br><br><br><br> <br>  <br><br> RE: Furry builds itself, and not much else <br><br> <br>      fruegel<br>Posted On 07/11/01 03:20PM <br><br><br>you a nut how long did you sit here writeing that???????<br><br><br> <br>  <br><br> "Add" <br><br> <br>      SylverMetalsmyt<br>Posted On 07/11/01 10:03PM <br><br><br>Gore drips...<br><br>Flash of steel, a limb separated from its owner....<br><br>Sound to the right...<br><br>A twist, a slice up from his heels, and another body sliced in two.....steel through flesh like a knife through butter...<br><br>--5 months in this hellhole...5 bloody stinking months with no sign of light, just an occasional food delivery made by a courier stealthy enough to get past the monkeys and get me my provisions....clerics, chanter, coming and going, aiding in the fight against Dalnir's doomed brainwashed denizens....no word from Sylver, Wynd or Fyre...did I remember to send a letter back telling them I joined in the war?-- Riverdane Blackrazor ponders the thought, as he reaches out a mailed fist and yanks a drooling coerced goblin off a terrified cleric. The goblin hits the wall and is quickly skewed like a pincushion.<br><br>All day, all night, it rages, slice hack chop, with River pausing midfight to light a cigarette and blow smoke over the feild of bodies...the stench is almost bearable now....blood, feces, sweat all mix into a perfume that is almost pleasant to the warrior. It may reek, but to him, it smelled like home.<br><br>"Here comes the next, River...." warns the current enchanter. "Mezz breaking, and it's coming in fast"<br><br>Riverdane stubs out his cigarette and spots the coerced erudite Shadowknight whipping around the corner, headed for his enchanter......the room crackle with energy, as the enchanter begins to cast.<br><br>--Gotta take that harmtouch--River thinks, as he flies forward with sword point aimed.<br><br>Through the throat of the shadowknight his blade slides, a perfect killshot, instant death. The enchanter would be impressed, had he not seen River pull that off before countless times in this never ending war.<br><br>Suddenly, the chanter watches in puzzlement, as River is jolted rigid, wideeyed....the warriors body seems ridden with electricity.<br><br>But the shadowknight was dead....the harmtouch should have died with it...<br><br>River lit up with an errie white light, blood trickling from the corner of his mouth when he bit his tongue. The chanter stepped back a pace, he didn't like the wild look in the warriors eyes...it bordered on madness.<br><br>As quickly as it had struck, the energy in the warriors limbs snapped out like a light, and his body dropped to the ground like a lifeless puppet. The chanter approached warily. Riverdane did not move.<br><br>Suddenly, with reflexes faster than the enchanter had ever seen on a man, River whipped out his hand and gripped the man's arm in a bonecrushing grip....he was pulled forward to the warrior, quite against his will, but River's grip was not to be compromised.<br><br>"What, Dane? What??" The chanter almost screamed, watching River try to make out a word. Had his arm been free he would have mezzed the metal clad gladiator and bolted for the zone.<br><br>Finally Riverdane was able to say a word, barely audible, but understandable.<br><br>"Quest..." <br><br> <br>  <br><br> The Battle For Her Life <br><br> <br>      Desdmona<br>Posted On 07/12/01 01:39PM <br><br><br>~ The Knights have gathered is the bowels of hell.....Solusek. Standing in the pit hidden Desdmona looks at her fellow Knights, her new family. She looks at her palm. She is one of them now. Her brand marks her apart from mortals tho she bears no magic of her own.<br>~ She chuckles thinking not even Aerimus has this. The Brand.~<br>Call are made for final preperations. Tensing and beginning to sweat she looks around......Ippyy, Jr, Aerimus, Glo. Mistress Hbird, Sonnyboy, Elane. Where are the rest?? She wispers to Jr, " where is our support?" Jr rubs his hands together, looking nervous. " They are gonna come in from Sol A in a rear flank I am told." " Final instructions Hbird calls out! Ippy you front, Sonny you back him, Glo you and Jr heal and you two,(pointing to Desdmona and Aerimus)you know your places. Elaine my 2nd you and I will direct and assist. They will be comming in hard at all angles....Be ready Knights.....My God protect us!"<br>~Aerimus looks at his beloved, noticing she is pale under her usually beautifull indigo skin.~<br>~ Before another breath is inhaled the battle comes. Givonne is on the Mistress...Ippyy and Sonny their backs presses together, wepons casting sparks as they shread aromor and spells aplenty for all. For a moment all is suspended in time.....that moment of danger, the aderelin the fear.....all composed to make a Knight what he/she is.<br>~Desdmona scored her best back stab of record....a 210 quite well for her age, but her wepon wont cast its spell. Someone has stripped her of her magical buffs and her sta is wearing on. Shouting, "Glo an extinguish fatigue!!!!" Elaine directs Nesspar the guild cleric to relieve her weakness. ~Aerimus is hitting for over 400 as his rageburner hits it marks again and again. " Mana song, Ippyy calls out!! Hbird I need your mana song..... PLZ I am oom and almost on the foor!!<br>~ Desdmona evades and crawls up to assist Ippyy. Once twice her shard pierces the Elf's skin 200, 175 she sees but he hasnt fallen yet. Coverd in her enemies blood or is it hers?? for an instant....she stops! Her diamond dagger is stripped from her hand. Unknowing that a blade is about to befall her, she turns to see who has stolen her wepon. <br>~ When the blade falls it is in slow motion it hits her with deadly force. She is knocked to the ground. Nesspar is casting celestial healing. Aerimus seeing his love fall dispaches his foe and yells a yell from the ancient cant as he charges the man who dare to strike his wife.~<br>~" I am bleeding badly," Desdmona yells! As the battle rages around her. Knights flood the pit from all directions.~ <br>~ Hbird is releved. In a silent wisper she thanks the Gods.~<br>~ Crying loudly, Desdmona curls in a ball. She is trying to tell Ness that her chest is on fire and her abdomen is in knots. Nesspar is desperately laying his healing hands on her body in all the places he hears her tell him. " I am dieing... my life force is draining from me," she screams in a final breath before unconscionsis takes her.<br>~ "Aerimus," yells Nesspar. " I cant stop her bleeding, it is comming to fast...... her heart. My God her legs!! Look at her legs!! Elaine!! A paladin we need lay hands or she will die!! I cant save her she has lost too much blood. I heal her as fast as she is dieing."<br>~ The Battle Rages On~ <br><br> <br>  <br><br> Death and Rebirth <br><br> <br>      Desdmona<br>Posted On 07/12/01 03:04PM <br><br><br>~"Am I dead," she asks? "No you are here in my arms," a voice tells her. "I have told you the truth.... indeed you have born a son. I did not say he would live." <br>~ Desdmona wails loudly her heart burning and her soul empty.She is in her dreams again, but this time it is different. She sees her body and those around it. She has visions of a stange man someone she has never met....Silver somebody. Who is he?? Her mind drifts to the Hall. Silverdane isnt he the largest painting in the Hall of Danes?<br>~Her heart burns as tho it has been ripped from her. Vaguely she remembers the battle.~<br>" What of my Knights, are they.... are they okay?" "The battle is done Child you have won and lost. Do you understand?" Desdmona wispers," I have a child? What of this Babe?" " See now your husband mourns his son. you shall bear him no more. I will send you with this knowing.... you will live a long life, suffer not greatly but will bear many burdens. You belong to 2 peoples of 2 families. Your loyality will be tested from both. Silverdane of whom you wonder is the creator of your beloved Danes. You must honor him as he is returning. Just as your hand bears your brand of service to your Knights your heart bears the marks of your Danes. You are to serve them both. Just as Lan served his Tribunal and his family.<br>~Go now as you must not dwell here or you will never leave... I shall see you again."<br>~With that Desdmona opened her eyes~<br>" Love I feared you would leave us," Aerimus murmered softly to her as he stroked her hair. " The Mistress conveyed you a special honor for your valor... see here I have it. (Aerimus shows her a fine new sword)<br>~Desdmona struggles to sit up in her sick bed to see all in her room. Looking she sees the tired cleric, Nesspar and Ippyy both of whom never left her since she fell. Nesspar declared his patient recovering and trembles as he takes her hand. "You know you almost died.. by the Gods we serve Vividos happened by and he healed you. I could not I am afraid. I called for a paladin and he showed up. Who is he?? Is he a palidan or a druid," the cleric inquired? "Vividos is an old and dear friend," Desdmona stated. Wondering how Vividos showed up at the precise time he did. "He asked me to become a Dane at the tender age of 9 seasons. Alas, I didnt accept then for I was young and foolish. We have been close ever since."<br>"DESDMONA," Aerimus'es voice sobbed....."WHY... WHY did you not tell me you were with child?? I would have never let you go to battle in such a condition. NOW OUR SON IS DEAD!!!" <br>~ Putting her hands to her face and sobbing......." I didnt know!!! I didnt know!!"<br>~Husband and Wife together mourn the loss. Holding eachother tightly sobbing~<br>~Ippyy clears his throat and looks to Des. " Dear Lady have not for your help I would have died also. I stayed to see if you were okay. You know you are as dear to me as my own child. God speed in your recovery and I mourn for your loss." Is saying that Ippyy backs out of the room.<br>"Nesspar," Desdmona chokes. " Please observe the rites of burial for our child. Prepare him for his return to the earth from whence he came. He shall be buried at the cross roads in Butcher Block. Desperate deserves to see his only grandchild once before he is committed to the Gods."<br>~Desdmona continues........to noone as her voice is filled with pain and renewal...." His death can be seen as a birth of sorts. I was told Dane would be reborn. Thru him my, Son, bonds will be forged old hurts healed and a new foundation can be cast. I pray this will be so.<br>Now how soon can I travel?"<br>"Love you do not think clearly... you are distraught now," Aerimus soothed. " He is MY son too. I mourn him as you do. I feel uneasy at what you speak. To put our child in a place that isnt sacred and consecrated by the Gods......."<br>~To whit Desdmona replied. " We have 2 of the best clerics. Wyyndane and Nesspar they can consecrate the ground and his place will be open for all to see and come to in times of confusion. I WILL HAVE THIS..... OR BY GODS YOU WILL NOT HAVE ME!!!" Leave me to mourn and heal my body...... both of you. I will have no more of this!! I will be about in a day or so have my things ready to travel and ask Send if she will port us please? Now have some deciency and leave me to clean up."<br>~ Realizing she was harsh....she takes her husbands hand. Holding him back as the Cleric leaves the room. "Please understand.... Husband it has to be this way. I will bear no more children I already know. A fate that distresses me greatly. Cant his death mean something?? Not just a useless death committed in the throwes fo battle?? I have never asked you for anything. For this I ask a lot I know."<br>~Aerimus kisses Desdmona's forhead thinking to himself....how did this woman bind him so??? From the moment he touched her hand the first time he felt her. Her passion, her love and her soul. He could never deny her anything she asked. In the last few days he had watched her change... grow in some ways to a wisdom beyond her seasons. Her lithe body bear numerous scars and her hair now streaked with black. So strange and beautifull his lovely dark elf.<br>"It shall be as you asked, Des you know I cant deny you. I shall make the preparations and ask for Send. She should be here with you. You need a woman's help seeing as how your mother isnt here. Do you wish me to send word to your Father?"<br>"He already knows.....he heard my cry of anguish on the wind. But yes send word of our travels there, that there is to be a burial there at the cross roads and tell my Uncle Topa I didnt stab myself to kill the enemy. Yet I slayed them.<br><br>to be contimued..............<br><br>Desdmona Shadowborn <br><br><br><br><br> <br>  <br><br> RE: Awakening <br><br> <br>      Wynddane<br>Posted On 07/14/01 07:11AM <br><br><br>bump<br>=op <br><br> <br>  <br><br> RE: Awakening <br><br> <br>      Desdmona<br>Posted On 07/14/01 09:17AM <br><br><br>your being mean Wyynd........I was having fun<br><br><br><br><br>Des <br><br> <br>  <br><br> RE: Awakening <br><br>User Options:  Edit Message <br> <br>      Druuni<br>Posted On 07/14/01 02:38PM <br><br><br>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br><br><br><br><br><br>Message Edited on 07/14/01 02:31PM by Druuni  <br>  <br><br> RE: Awakening <br><br> <br>      Multar88<br>Posted On 07/16/01 11:14AM <br><br><br>/snooore<br><br>Multar <br><br> <br>  <br><br> RE: Awakening <br><br> <br>      DesperateMeasur<br>Posted On 07/20/01 03:45PM <br><br><br>((OOC:)) Well this thread is almost 1 month old. In one month, we've filled 4 pages. With more then 100 posts. The writing and creative skills of Danes has shown through these pages. And with thier words everyone has shown how much Dane has ment to them. The support for Dane is obvious.<br><br>But now this thread is remaining untouched. Stories unfinished. Thoughts unread. Had this thread died, but others started that would have been somthing else.<br><br>But I'm still hearing that Dane is dead, and should be disbanded. I've heard this from Danes, Ex-Danes and friends. People that have supported Dane, but still say it can't be saved.<br><br>Before Sylverdane left the guild was on a wobbly leg. Then when he departed and several of the most loyal Danes left with him that last leg was cut out from under us. For those of us that stayed behind an impossible task was put to us.<br><br>I tried to set up a new web page. But honestly it is easier to go to handofdane.com so the news, roster and other information was left unnoticed by most.<br><br>I promoted my officers to replace the ones that had left with Sylver, or just left. But to save Dane too much time, effort and energy was needed that most of them did not have to give.<br><br>I've attempted to reignight the fire that once burned for Dane time and time again. But where once we shone like the sun, now we could hide in the light of a firefly.<br><br>I say this, remember Dane is one of the Oldest guilds on Everquest. We were one of the largest with an amazing member count of over 200 in November of 2000'. One of the most active guilds, with our raids, events and parties. Everyone knew Dane, and our elders. <br><br>Whatever else you say about The Hand of Dane, say, "Thank you, because it was one hell of a ride." <br><br>Deep Thoughts From a Shallow Mind<br>--Desperate Measures<br>Guild Leader of<br>The Hand Of Dane<br><br><br><br>width="388" height="154"&gt;<br><br><br><br><br> <br>  <br><br> RE: Awakening <br><br> <br>      SylverMetalsmyt<br>Posted On 07/20/01 09:51PM <br><br><br>(ooc: I had considered coming back to play on Rallos, to rejoin the guild, the works, Desp...I left the threads open to lead into the quests, added Riverdane's history into it...some people responded admirably, jumped even further in, and I was just waiting for a little bit more to add the next part itself...but honestly, like I said, and had been warned, the reception to me coming back wasn't going to be warm, and in some cases even hostile...a lot of people forget I put two damned years into building that guild...instead i get people thinking they are cute with tales of where I've been, which hasnt really been too much of a secret, and pricks on the public board with how 'Shady" I am..=p...I mean, do they even know what Dane was about when it started?...or do they just remember the free loot at the giveaways?....quite honestly, what was starting out to be a nice step back into Rallos is just become more of the Same Old [censored]....whatever you wish to do with the guild is yours to do...you did a great job, and you got these people to love you....The Hand of Dane is no longer a Dane, since I'm such a [censored]...=p...it is yours, do with it as you will, but watch your back if you ever try to leave it, it will smack you on the ass on your way out...<br><br>I'm probably moving Sylverdane to another server...the air just isn't very warm here anymore<br><br>And for you information, friends and enemies alike, when I ran this guild, I gave you my real life....sorry I needed to take it back <br><br> <br>  <br><br> RE: Sylver <br><br>User Options:  Edit Message <br> <br>      Druuni<br>Posted On 07/20/01 11:34PM <br><br><br>ooc: I hope you don't draw this conclusion all out of Dit's post? Ppl have been running around smiling here since the word got out you maight be appearing back here...and it makes me having a great feeling to. So, I've made you change your mind once before...only temporarily though. <br>So, this one'll be for you to decide. Anyway I would..really I mean it, LOVE to see you back even if it's only for trying things out... Your talent for making people *feel* things in this game is---extraondinary! (I recall how I was just sitting in Lake Dane, not moving at all when I kept watching tells and /gu during the Taja/Kristanna episode...and trust me, when you told us you were crying behind the keys...I think you know you were NOT alone about that...;) -And thus it really isn't strange that a lot of them backfire at you, nomatter how much right or wrong things you would do...you might have been *the* largest personality on the server, and as we all know: With fame comes blame.<br><br>Anyway: When you gave us the MAGIC in those 2 years, you gave us something neither *you* nor anyone else can take away from us again.<br><br>Dane is Dane, period!<br><br><br>(I'd love to see ya again, for sure.

He didnt know what reaction this group would have to him suddenly appearing out of nowhere. Feeling the tension rise he finally decided to wait for another time. Backing up to his original spot and keeping an eye on that warrior lass who seemed to keep scanning the area, he crouched and gathered his shadows around him. Dujinn retreated back to the entrance of Dagnors Cauldron while he made and discarded new plans of deliverance.<br>Why is this so hard? Dujinn whispered.<br>Maybe because your weak? a voice said behind him and made his heart skip a beat.<br>Unsheathing his mace, Dujinn spun and faced his adversary who was a wizard by the looks of him.<br>What can I do for you sorcerer? Dujinn asked already knowing what the reply would be.<br>Why die of course! he replied as he started the mystical gestures for a spell.<br>Dujinn dodged that bolt that screamed at him and leapt toward his opponent swinging his mace. <br>Gasping as a magical shield deflected his mace, Dujinn stepped through the shadows to some distance away.<br>Chuckling the wizard began his next spell. Summoning all his skill and training Dujinn prepared to face the caster win or lose. Throwing up a disease cloud around the wizard he charged in mace leading.<br>The Charge shattered the casters concentration and the spell he was weaving crumbled as Dujinns mace thumped into his chest.<br>Shield or not you will die today wizard! Dujinn screamed as he pummeled the man. <br>Dujinn began to cast a spell and the wizard clutched his chest screaming in pain, interrupting a counter spell.<br>The battle lasted what seemed like forever. Mystical spells met with the force of shadows in constant conflict for hours. Sweat poured from dujinn with every counterstrike and the spells came at him slower and slower. <br><br>Sitting against the tree Dujinn examined his burns. His breathing was shallow and he was weak but smiling. Glancing at the corpse of the wizard he pulled some bandages out of his pocket. Something the wizard said during the battle troubled him. Why would that guy want to find the Danes? Dujinn pondered.<br>After bandaging up the open wounds, Dujinn hobbled over to the nearest goblin camp to finish his healing.<br><br><br>Tryzen Tru'Hael<br>55th Templar of Reverant<br>Cleric of Tunare<br><br> <br>  <br><br> RE: Continued.... <br><br>User Options:  Edit Message <br> <br>      Druuni<br>Posted On 07/28/01 02:39PM <br><br><br>~The great wolf lifts her head and gazes towards west..what was those distant sounds of battle?<br>Putting her head to rest between her paws again, she looks back towards the familys head...Desperate looks like he is in deep thoughts.
