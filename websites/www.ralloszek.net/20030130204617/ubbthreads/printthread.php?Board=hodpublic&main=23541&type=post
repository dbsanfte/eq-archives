     I'm not afraid of you any longer Wakenbake, I have pked in self-defense in the past and turn anti to find a good guild and some friends.  Through hard work did I level my wizard to level 20.  You say you hate my guts only because I made fun of your last guild for being jerks to me.  I never said I didn't like you, you assumed it, so basically you just made an ass out of yourself.  Your probably not even in range of Tinyx, and if I were in their guild, I would do my best to be friendly to everyone in the guild, and fit in.  I'm currently buying Tinyx some new items, yes I have a main, but do you really think I'd tell you who he is?   The fact is that you never really got to know me Wakenbake, you made a hasty judgement, and didn't even want to  get to know me, we couldn't of been friends.  You say i'm boring but what have you done lately that's exciting?  I just got back from a one week deployment in Anchorage for training, I got to visit another base and it was pretty cool.  Send Tinyx a tell in game anytime if you want to just talk or better yet, want to fight me.  Wakenbake,  I just want you to know that in the beginning I wanted to be your friend.  I don't get it, he hates me when he doesn't even know me?
