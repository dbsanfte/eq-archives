Well,me and grimance did fight,after all.My level 9 paladin versus his level 10 necro,with grimance himself playing oor healer/buffer.Heres how it went down.<br />1.After initial conversation,grimance tells me to meet his necro Philistia in felwithe.I'm all for it.<br />2.I informed grimance that i saw right through his little plot,and that i was sure he would be buffed,I had no buffs other than level 9 self buff.<br />3.I do /who all hand (otherwise known as /who all wuss),Grimance and Philistia are both online,apparently this fag has 2 comps.<br />4.so after i got some gear for my rogue in bazaar,i logged me paladin,Rhoole,and proceed to pok felwithe port.<br />5.I tell grimance,i cant believe you gonna talk all this trash,and you got your big char there to play oor faggot.<br />6.Grimass says,"we'll fight a duel,fool"<br />7.i reply,"good,that way you know i cant loot,it only fair since i 9 myself.<br />8.so i port in to felwithe,I spawn,and theres Philistia there,with Grimdunce sitting on the ground,i target Phillis,and type /D.<br />9.Phillis attacks right away,not even accepting /duel(you see where this is headed? he can't get oor healing if he accepts duel) &gt;(<br />10.I run up on him,and slash and bash near 60 hp off him,and his health bar doesnt even move,he lost like a fifth of a hp bub,more or less,i doubt he had 1500 hp,but 60 pts wasnt any much damage to him.<br />11.i turn to his pet,i stay on him,taking about 120 hp off him,he loses a bub of health<br />12.meanwhiles Phyllis is poisoning me an dotting,so i do cure poison,ive lost near 2 bubs of hp after 3 minutes<br />13.i chase the guy around a bit,hes life tapping so he full hp again,i take about 70 pts again,same results.<br />14.i return to pet,determined to stay on it til it gone.i have pet to 2 bubs,i know ive cracked near 300 hp off him if not more,but im down to 1 bub,also phillis seems to be out of mana as well,this is when he informs me a PK is on him.<br />15.I lay hands,then finish pet off.now Philnuts is standing still,while a high elf (naked) is beating on him.i run up and inspect,he has 3 pices of armor,it appears to be dusty burlap,and padded.Of course hes buffed no questions now.<br />16.i start Benihanaing his ass,2 times i get him to a bub and half hp,over 5 minutes,but as anyone can guess this is where grimance stands and heals him back up.<br />17.another high elf walks up,and the pk that tried(ineffectively) to kill Phil says"hey,blowtard its me rangio,this my wizzy"<br />18.i start getting mezzed,and confused and such,meantime grimance heals his weak ass necro again.<br />19.well,im mezzed,and i also realize i dont have time to keep trying to kill the necro waiting for Gimpance to run out of mana,so were right by pok book anyways,so i click on it,and make my retreat,(heres a nice piece of info,you can port into PoK while mezzed if u close enough to book)I was still full hp from laying hands,obviously i dint really need to use lay hands when i did.<br />20.now Philistia sends me a tell"Haha u were owned"<br />21.I reply"ass,you were buffed,you had hp buff""and you got full heals,what? like 4?"<br />22.Here is where the lies start "Phillis says" you were buffed,thats why i oor healed,and you had to get help from your 2 PK friends,and you still ran."<br />23.I'm like"Fuck?friends? they mezzed me i didn't feel like being mezzed until they ran out of mana too,so i went to PoK,I didnt ask them to come along,naked jackass twits like them wait to see others fighting,it only way they can get a kill"<br />24.says Phillis "well,you were buffed,my pet should have killed you long ago." I say "bitch,I lay hands once,your pet was hitting me for 1s,I have 333 hp unbuffed and 340 ac"thats why i dint fall right over,I'm full hp as it is,I think we both know who won that fight.Without u buffs ida killed u 10 times over as u well know."<br />25.So heres how it stands,Grimance thinks he won,because I zoned out when i was mezzed,I think I won,because i killed his 500 hp pet,he had buffs,he lied an said duel not PvP,I lost 4 bubs of health and he lost like 18 bubs of health,he had to have a oor healer,and he said the 2 pks were helping me kill him,when the 1 couldnt touch his hp at all,and the other attacked me.<br />26.I don't care who won,if hed fought a straight up fight,if he had done that,and killed me,i woulda told everyone here he fought me and won.As it is,I now know Grimance to be the lying puss he really is,and I think its damn funny he claimed he had no buffs,and I had all these buffs,when I clearly saw the truth of the matter.I went in there with no buffs,he had apparently hp buff at very least,but i think he had more.I still dealt him 5 times the damage he dealt me,and he thinks he won.<br /><br />Well,obviously we should all go out and make dark elf necros and get them to 10,because the pet has 500hp,and the elf has 800 hp at level 10.Why is there any chars out there who ain't dark elf necros?shouldnt that be all there is?<br /> <br />GRIMANCE IF YOU EVER WANT TO BE A MAN&lt;AND FIGHT A REAL FIGHT&lt;AND TAKE THE TRAINING WHEELS OFF JUST SEND ME A TELL
