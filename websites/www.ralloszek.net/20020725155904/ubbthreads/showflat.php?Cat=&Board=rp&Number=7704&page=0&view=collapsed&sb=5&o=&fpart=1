The Continued Adventures of Kelleher Ivyelm<br>Chapter 3- The Exile of the Sword<br><br>	Wind blew harshly over the frozen Velious landscape. Eastern Wastes was perhaps<br>the longest leg of the trade route from Freeport to Thurgadin. For only a little over a year,<br>trade companies (Legitimate, and the other kind too...) had been traversing the trecherous<br>stretch of land, from the scortching sands of Ro, to the deathly frigid Ice Clad Ocean. The<br>route was perilous, infested with everything from roudy orc tribes and desert bandits, to<br>frost giant marauders and a legendary sea turtle devouring skiffs whole (if you believe<br>what they say anyway), but the pay off was worth the risk (to those adventuers who<br>survived, especially those who took the cut of their fallen comrades). Travelers from the<br>Old World made a killing exporting platnum, diamonds, hides, tropical fruits and various<br>alcohols (The Coldain say it helps keep them warm) and trading for valuable Velium,<br>exotic hides, and blue diamonds. There was also a fairly active mercenary and wepons<br>trade, as the Coldain were waging a war on all fronts, and paid particularly well for<br>artifacts or ‘Specialists’ which might give them an edge over their foes. The caravan<br>sought refuge from the chill at one of the small Coldain outposts along the way, as the sun<br>was setting. To stay out much later would be to tempt faith- and the horses would have<br>frozen to death anyway. After settling down around the camp fire inside the round hut, the<br>party of adventurers began making perparations for the night. Cloaks and rolls were laid<br>upon the floor, and a walrus, which the caravan had come across, was being butchered<br>and smoked, by a troll who seemed to know what he was doing. Wepons were sharpened,<br>entries were made in logs, bottles were opened, and sentries were posted near the door...<br>but not quite far from the warmth and light of the fire. The howls of dire wolves could be<br>heard in the night air and the travelers were glad to be where they were. An hour and a<br>half or so after night had fallen, a heavy wind kicked open the thick hide covering the<br>enterance to the hut. In the moment the wind lifted the flap, a dark figure had slid in,<br>ignored by the lazy eyed sentries. His shadow was pitched against the wall and shook with<br>the movements of the fire. Slowly, as if stepping from another spectrum of light, he made<br>himself visable. A figure of slightly below average height stood there, his form obscured<br>by the bulky brown cloak he donned, a hood hidding his face. What was the most distinct<br>feature of the traveler was an intracately decorated lanyard quiver strung over one<br>shoulder, and an ornately carved longbow over the other. As the first of the weary traders<br>noticed him placed their hands on the hilts of their wepons, he said, in common, “Hail.” A<br>human, who had made the run a number of times and was, for lack of a better term, the<br>leader of the expedition, got to his feet, rapier in hand, and pointing the blade of his wepon<br>to the newcomer, said “Hail. Explain yourself. Quickly.” Another breeze kicked up the<br>flap and forced the fire down for a second, darkening much of the enclosure. When the<br>light returned the traveler had slid back his hood, to reveal a fairly youthful, but wind<br>burned and sullen face. His eyes were a light glossy green, a tired, morose look spread<br>across his face. The contours of a frown held his thin pale lips. His hair was unkempt and<br>tustled, and barely visable beneath the crown of dirty brown locks, were the tips of the top<br>of his pointed ears- clearly elven, although one easily could’ve taken him as human by the<br>plain looking features of his face. “What explanation does a weary traveler need for<br>wanting the protection and warmth of fire on a night such as this?” By now all of the band<br>had roused and drawn their wepons, forming a semi-circle around the stranger. A dark elf<br>in worn chainmail holding two long, rusted dagers sneered, “Lets just dispatch this refuse<br>and have end to this.” A few of the more bold members of the group muttered agreement,<br>after so much traveling not being very enthusiastic about anything. The stranger turned his<br>head and glared in their general direction, and most turned away, not able to take his gaze.<br>He returned to the human, “I am a lone ranger, I assure you, that I am of no threat to you<br>and your band. I mearly spend my days hunting this frigid land, and make a living selling<br>the hides, furs and meat. I mearly would have the warmth of your fire and living company.<br>If you would that I left, say it now and I will do so.” The human, lowered his guard. “You<br>are welcome to stay, Sir...?” “Ivyelm.” “Well, Sir Ivyelm, I am Ghareed. You are<br>welcomed to stay for the night, that is if you could favor us with a tale of your travels. Its<br>my experiance that rangers are never at a shortage for those.” A grin went across the<br>ranger’s lips. “Yes. Yes, I could do that. Thank you Sir Ghareed.” The rest of the group<br>had already returned to repose, some of them begrudgingly. The ranger remained where<br>he stood, and a human, curious of this turned to him. “Why do you not come forward,<br>closer to the fire, Sir Ivyelm?” she asked earnestly, her smile as warm as the blazing flames<br>of the hearth. He looked at her and the flames, almost longingly, but sadly, and replied, “It<br>is probobly best that I keep this distance madame. Thankyou.” <br><br>	After everyone had settled in more, a few bottles were being passed around, and<br>stories were being told. Ghareed, sitting on one of his packs near the fire, smoking a pipe,<br>said, “Well, my good Sir Ivyelm, why don’t you pay the afore agreed price and tell us a<br>story?” The ranger had made himself comfortable (that is to say, as comfortable as such a<br>paranoid individual gets). He had unrolled a few taned and treated hides, and proped up<br>his bags as make shift cushions. He was on his haunches on the skins, his arms folded to<br>his chest. “Very well. Of what would you have me speak?” “Of might!” Said the deep<br>baratone voice of an ogre in the back of the room. “Of magic!” Said a high pitched voice,<br>belonging to a gnome in a neatly starched and brightly colored robe. “Of cunning.” Said<br>the dark elf of before, twirling his blades around between his fingers non-chalantly. The<br>young woman who spoke before, was laying on the ground propped up on some rolled up<br>clothes, and looking up said, “Speak of the war of good and evil, of order and discord.<br>Some grand adventure, Sir Ivyelm!” The ranger paused and looked around, and then<br>looked to himself intently. “Some grand adventure...” He muttered. “Very well, I think I<br>know what I will speak of.” He shifted and got to his feet, and drew from beneath his<br>cloak a long golden sword’s hilt. As the hilt, lacking a blade was unschiefed, there was a<br>slight hum and a clear, milky white form of the missing blade materialized. The ranger<br>moved it gently, it reflecting the light from the fire clearly, as though it were glass, though<br>also eminating a dull white glow. Those who were not paying attention before looked on<br>the blade in wonder and amazement. He ran a hand up and down the blade, a slight shift in<br>the ethereal energy occuring when his fingers touched it. He then returned the blade to his<br>side, disapearing beneath the contours of his cloak. He returned to his haunches, and,<br>using a rather long, archaic looking dager, appearing to be of ancient Combine in oragin,<br>he drew a circle in the ground. He clarified by cutting a cresent shape in the circle. The<br>moon. Luclin. As he scratched out the image he spoke: “Quite some time ago I found<br>myself on Luclin. Was then that started a series of events which tied the soul of myself, to<br>the soul of the wepon I showed you before. I suppose that is the nature of the wepon... It<br>ties its’s self to it’s weilder. It is a part of me and I am a part of it... Even now I can feel<br>it’s pull...”<br><br>	The small green figure was drastically obscured by the looming gothic archetecture<br>of Katta Kastelum. The lamp light from streets and windows reflected in the puddles<br>forming on the street from the falling rain. The sky was gray, and occaisionally there was a<br>flash of lightning, and a dull crack of sound rumbling in the distance. He passed though<br>shadow and light, pressing towards the massive cathedral looming in the distance. He<br>could smell the damp soil of the graveyard outside of the building, and he tread softly over<br>the hallowed ground. As he climbed the stair to the massive, wooden doors, they opened,<br>slowly, creaking. Instantly, the cold, damp ranger was hit with the warm, dry smell of<br>inscence and dust. As he stepped in, the heavy doors closed behind him. He ran a hand<br>through his wet locks and proceeded down the vacant aysle. He found a set of stairs, and<br>walked down a few flights, in almost complete darkness. Finally, he came to a lightly<br>luminated corridor, which he slowly walked down, his boots clanking against the smooth<br>flagstone. He could make out the small figure of the elderly custodian of the catacombs.<br>He was a Halfling, dressed immaculately, although he himself was quite clearly aging. He<br>had a whispy puff of white hair sitting on the top of his head, and thick white side burns.<br>He turned to the ranger, who, out of respect, bowed. The halfing returned the bow<br>piously. “Did you find the missing artifacts?” He asked hopefully. “Yes. I believe these are<br>what you said were taken from the tombs?” Said the ranger, removing a few trinkets and<br>handing them over to the halfling. He looked them over, squinting to make them out in the<br>dim light, and a smile spread across his face, “Yes, yes, these are the artifacts. How did<br>you find them?” It was a long story. The quest for finding the items removed from the<br>crypt by grave robbers had taken him across the face of the moon. It had been a perilous<br>adventure that pitted him against creatures he had never before encountered on Norrath. It<br>was, however, a way to prove his affiliation to the people of Katta Kastelum, apparently<br>the remnants of Norrath’s own Combine Empire, and hopefully, get them to tell them of<br>how they came to be on Luclin. Perhaps more important than that, he could recieve an<br>account of history that had been lost on Norrath. He would take note and return it to<br>Surefall for the druids and other wise ones to pour over. Rangers like him were always the<br>vanguard into new territory. He was a seasoned scout, having combed over and<br>doccumented lands South and East of Surefall, such as Kunark or Velious. He had risen in<br>rank simply by returning with his life. The halfling turned around and walked down the<br>corridor further, and turning, motioned for the ranger to follow. “You may think I’m an<br>old sentimentalist, for wanting these dusty heirlooms back... But you see, they are very<br>much important to those in my charge... The dead, they tie themselves to such objects<br>from their life. They are restless when they are removed and they can only know true sleep<br>when they are returned. Ah, here!” The halfling stopped abruptly and removed a small<br>wooden case from the wall. He opened a little brass latch and placed the items in it,<br>closing it and handing it to Kelleher. “Here, place this on top of that sarcofygus please.”<br>The ranger took the old container and, cautiously, walked towards the stone case. As he<br>approached he could dimly make out what looked like ancient combine carvings, not<br>unlike those sometimes found on ruins and runes on Norrath. He could vaugly make out<br>the image of a tall warrior in plate armor, standing gravly, chisled in stone as well. He<br>placed the box on the tomb and stepped back. As he did a pale white force of energy<br>pulled around the box, lifting it into the air where it disapeared completely. The whisp<br>turned into a hand, which, with the gesture of it’s fingers, held a newly materialized<br>wepon. “Take it,” Whispered the halfing. “It is a gift from the spirits for aiding them.” The<br>ranger grinned, and, reaching out, took the hilt of the wepon in his hand. As he did, he<br>staggered a moment, feeling the wepon draw out his life’s force, lowering his strength and<br>stamina. The blade pulsed to life, and he drew it back, bowing to the hand as it<br>dematerialised in a wave.<br><br>To be continued....<br><br>Kelleher Ivyelm<br>47th Level Half Elven Ranger<br>The Archer of Rallos

Part 2.<br /><br />    The cold night air blew in the open window, raising the silken drapes and chilling the room. The two forms lay unmoving in the bed, armor and articles of clothing lay cast about the room recklessly. One of the forms, sensing the slumber of the other, stirred, opening her eyes and slidding out from under the covers. She was a woman of dark complexion, obviously one of gypsie stock, as one would usually find on Antonica. She squinted as she peered through the room, her brown eyes looking about for what she had come to get. Finally, slung on the bedpost she spied the scabbard containing the blade, and gently wrapped her fingers around the wepons hilt, drawing it out of the scabbard without a sound. As it reached halfway out, she stopped, hearing the sound of wood creaking behind her. "I think you have some explaining to do, my lady." Said the ranger. She slowly turned around, not letting go of the hilt of the wepon, and saw that the ranger was indeed awake, and crouching on the bed, bow drawn with arrow. "Damn, he's fast." she thought to her self (although that wasn't what she had been thinking no more than fourty five minutes prior...). "I see your awake..." She started, "And I see you've finally made your move on that sword you've been eying since I met you in the tavern tonight." said the ranger, not easing up on the tension on the bow string. "You knew?" "Aye." "And you still-" "Aye. Now will you let go of the sword before I have to pin you to the wall?" She closed her eyes, sighed and removed her hand from the blade. She then, slowly, reached over and grabbed one of the blankets to cover herself. "Now then, lets you and I have a talk." The woman sat on the edge of the bed. "I know what you're thinking, but I'm not some common theif. My people, the Combine, may have fallen some since the breaking of The Empire, but we haven't sank that low." "Aye... A thief would've tried to slit my throat and take my platnum much earlier in the evening. Why the sword?" "Do you know of its history?" "History? Its just something I picked up on Luclin..." "Then it as I believed." "Once more, my lady, for those of us out of the know..." "I suppose I don't have very much choice... Very well. Among my people, I am an Enchantress of some accord. I make it my buisiness to travel the world in search of relics from The Empire, and I've been looking for that sword for quite some time... I had thought it was lost to history, but when I got a message from a merchant friend in Freeport that an Outrider had been seen weilding a sword of similar build well... I knew it had to be on Luclin. It must have made it that way with the Exodus, that explains where its been all these years." The ranger sighed and layed his wepon down. "Aye, it was given to me by a spirit who I did a service for. Tell me more." The woman concentrated, as if sorting out her thoughts, "Well... Legend has it that the blade, the Long Sword of Ethereal Energy was weilded by one of my people's greatest champions, a General of our armies. Legend has it that eventually, this general met his fate at the hands of a powerful practitioner of magic... The blades lifetime of warface coupled with the forces that rent the General apart had a side effect of fusing part of his soul into the wepon... Surely you have noticed how it draws your life's very essence when you merely touch it? That is the soul of the General, clinging to life. Although he had fallen in that battle, one of his comrades picked up the wepon and struck the killing blow against the magus, even as the blade was still hot and charged from the previous attack. Thus began the blades long, violent history. Those who weilded it continued to grow in might and power, but ultimately the General drew their essence and experiance into the blade. It made men great... It is that greatness that I've come seeking. That blade is both a valuable record of my people's history, and it is something that, weilding, I could use to restore our former glory... Which is why... I cannot allow you to walk away from here with it." The ranger's eye's darted from her dark brown eyes to her fingers, curling and begining to charge with magical energy. Before he could react he was shot against the wall with a charge. He shook off the attack and lept onto his attacker, shifting into wolf form as he jumped through the air. He locked his teeth onto the woman's neck and tugged feverishly as she screamed. He dug his claws into her back and she fell to her knees, doubling over in pain. Energy began to crackle at her fingers again, but the ranger shook, managing to disrupt her attempts at casting. Finally, her form went limp, hitting the ground with a thud, spent of physical and magical energy. The ranger released his grip and shifted back to his humanoid form. He hastily began to put his armor back on and sling his wepons at his side, twirling the sword into it's satchel. "Sorry my lady but you were right... This swords a part of me now." He strolled out the door and into the streets of Qeynos... She followed him, glaring as he faded into the urban cityscape. "You've made an enemy today Kelleher Ivyelm... and enemy you'll live to regret making."<br />~The End
