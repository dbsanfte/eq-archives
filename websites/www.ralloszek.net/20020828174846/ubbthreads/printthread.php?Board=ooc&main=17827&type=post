It is with a heavy heart that I post this message to you all.  A close friend of mine passed away this weekend, a man who was active in online roleplaying and a fan of the science fiction / fantasy genre.  He was a kind and gentle man, who would do anything for his friends, one who always counseled and consoled those in need, offering advice and assistance as was his means to give.<br /> <br />I was his roommate, renting out the bottom floor of his townhouse in order to help him meet his mortgage, as he had been unemployed since November of 2001.  He desperately looked for work but continued to slip further and further into apathy and depression, hiding it as best he could from the rest of us, but privately ceasing to take proper care of himself.  I came home last night from an Anime Convention (Otakon) and discovered my friend, who was as close to me as a brother, dead in our home from a stroke or heart attack (the autopsy has not been done yet).  He was due to turn 38 this August 1 and was looking forward to turning his life around.<br /> <br />As a writer, frequently put death in my stories, using it for a plot device, to provoke emotion and add spice to the writing.  In reality, death SUCKS.  My friend died in the manner he feared the most, alone without a special person who loved and cared for him, someone who was with him to share life together.  His death was not dramatic but rather something that claimed him as he slept, unexpected and unbidden.  I never will get to see my friend again, to talk to or watch movies with, to share the events of the day and laugh at jokes.  I took all these things for granted and did not appreciate the value of his friendship as much as I could have.  I thought he would always be around to hang out with.  I was wrong.<br /> <br />In closing I ask this: never take your friends for granted, treasure the time you have with them.  For my friend, please remember the man, Timothy McClosky (also known as Thalodar in Everquest and Dark Age of Camelot) in your thoughts and prayers, no matter to what entity they may be.  He was a good man and a good friend, and I will miss him.<br /><br />Please let those that knew him online what happened.<br /> <br />-Jerry aka Kyoshou
