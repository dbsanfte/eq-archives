Yeah I guess an SK is equal to a Nec in the pulling dept, actually, so we're tied as the second-best =D  Although I personally feel the Nec is still the far better choice overall, as if one has to FD before getting far enough away from the pull area to ensure there are no adds upon a re-aggro, they have to STAY FD long enough for the MT to solidly establish aggro before they can get up.  I'd rather have the SK up there tanking/meleeing in that time frame and building aggro so the Nec can stand back up n get to casting.  I think overall that makes for the fastest overall group dmg in the shortest amt of time, and allows everyone to get to doing his/her job as soon as possible.  SKs are supposed to be standing at the mobs feet the duration of the encounter, not laying down FD while the casters are getting on the hate list.  If he is, the raid isn't getting to utilize his presence to it's full potential.<br /><br />N I didnt mean to slam ya like that, Uulos, but that's an old sore-spot with Necs, and it does tend to aggravate one that even though things have changed SO much (and SO long ago), some ppl still have the same old misconceptions.  I even saw a guy bitching on the necro boards just the other day that some group wouldn't let him in because "pets steal XP".  Why he wanted to group in the 1st place is beyond me, but u get the point.  And I can't argue with keeping a PK at the lvl it's class has the best advantage over others in range, either.  I think most ppl with twinkie PK alts do the same thing.  At least thats what somebody from AD told me  <img src="/images/graemlins/bootyshake.gif" alt="" /><br /><br /><br /><br />
