Much happened that day.  The preparations for the journey went smoothly,  though not done to Baltiscan's satisfaction until very late in the eve.  Deciding they needed a good night's rest, he ordered a guest chamber readied for Carezzia.<br><br>His own rooms were deep in the basements of the guild house, hidden from the sunlight, surrounded by the damp clay smell of his boyhood home in Neriak.  It suited him, and he rested well each night in his dragon bed.<br><br>Once, she had slept in the dragon bed, but she was not quite sure how she felt about that yet.  A slow blush crept over her skin as she remembered one eve, many days before, when she had burst into his study covered in dust, disheveled, with tears in her armor and tangles in her hair.  She had been on the losing end of several battles while hunting, and no end of frustration was oozing from her.<br><br>Far from being the usual stern commander who grilled her on details, he had put his administrative work away in the drawers of his large mahogany desk.  With his own hands, he had bathed her and washed her hair in his private bathing room, even combing the tangles from her wild, unruly curls with a gentleness that surprised her.<br><br>Stubborn about those Shadow Knight's vows, he stayed honorable when he removed his own clothing and joined her in the large dragon claw footed tub to clean her thoroughly.  Even when he tucked her into his bed, he held himself in reserve, lightly trailing kisses up the side of her neck to her waiting lips as he wrapped his strong arms around her.  That was all; one taste, and then he had held her tightly enough that brooked limited movement, until she finally fell asleep.<br><br>The room had been dimly lit, and it seemed to her to have a sinister aura about it.  Late into the night, she had awakened, still held tightly, and thought she had been dreaming.  <br><br>The dragons were moving.  <br><br>The thick mahogany wood was carved with a great detail, of long dragon bodies wrapped around and around the full height of  bedposts almost reaching the high ceiling.  As she watched, the carvings seem to raise slightly from the rest of the wood, and take on a reddish glow, slowly slithering around and around the posts, then over the headboard and footboard.  She gasped, only to feel Baltiscan's arms tighten around her to hold her still.  Certain it was a dream, she said nothing, and finally relaxed enough to sleep once more.<br><br>Upon the morn, she had questioned him of her dream, but only received a small smile with an unreadable expression in his eyes.  "Your imagination amazes me at times, Lady Carezzia," was all he ventured to say.   Then he had taken her attention away by suggesting mayhap she had been nervous and flustered being held so closely in a virile, handsome,  male elf's strong arms throughout the night.  Of course, that led to a completely different conversation, and she wondered now if that had not been purposely planned.<br><br>She thought of this as she watched herself in the mirror of the oaken vanity in the guest chambers.  The last stroke of the brush smoothed through her hair, and she laid it carefully aside, her small hands lifting to push the silky tresses, softened more from the brushing, away from her shoulders.  She was tired, and knew she would need much rest for the days to come.<br><br>Sleep came quickly, but in that, there is usually a catch.  Her dream came almost just as quickly; the one of old, though this time it had a new twist.<br><br>The dark sky crackled and hissed as lightning erupted from it, striking the ground with enough force to shake it for miles. The heavens were furious with Carezzia, cloaking itself with dark angry clouds, and sending the bolts to try to find her as she ran through a dark forest. Small bumps covered her skin, responding both to the heavy charge of electricity in the air and her anticipation of the next strike of fury that she knew would be sent in her direction. <br><br>She could feel the silky material of the royal blue sarong she was wearing; the one she always wore in this dream, though she had never possessed such an item. Wrapped tightly around her slender body and looped over one shoulder, it was only loosely done from mid thigh down to her knees, and for some reason she focused on the sensation of that part rustling against her skin in the wind. <br><br>The path she ran was unfamiliar to her, and she couldn't anticipate each bend and turn. The bolts were striking closer, though, and she knew that moving as the crow flies would benefit her more than through the twists and curves of which the path was leading.  As she left the path, a vine grabbed her bare foot, sending her flying to the ground.<br><br>Her hands clutched the thick grass as she pulled her foot, trying to free it from the vine. It hadn't registered with her that her foot was being held, and she thought it only stuck. Her view of things was made murky as the fury of the wind sent leaves and twigs flying through the air. To make it worse, her thick mass of hair kept blowing in her face, shutting out the sight, but not the sound, of the large tree exploding near her as it became victim to the next lightning bolt.<br><br>The bright light engulfed her, the roar almost deafening her, even though she pressed her palms tightly to her pointed elfin ears. She thought maybe she had lost proper hearing, because her ears became filled with the sounds of small whispers that she couldn't understand, and little laughs that seemed to make fun of her.<br><br>She look frantically back at her foot as she kicked to loosen it, and her heart stopped when she saw who held her fast.  His hand had a death grip around her small ankle, and his face was twisted in anger.  Galienne.  <br><br>Tears immediately came to her eyes to trail down her cheeks, and her whisper was snatched by the roaring wind.  "Please…..please forgive me….."<br><br>The sensation of the material tightening above her knees took her attention again, and she wondered why she would even feel it at a moment such as this. <br><br>And then she felt herself dropping, not far, and hitting with a thud to the floor.<br><br>Gingerly sitting up, she ran her fingers through her hair to push it back from her face. She was on the floor of the sleeping chamber with the sheets tangled around her thighs and, just as one does who awakens to reality, she knew immediately she had been dreaming.<br><br>Not that she didn't still feel the horror and sorrow from it. Her heart was racing as she crawled back onto the bed, and it took long moments for her to begin to breathe properly again. <br>She had had this dream many, many times, yet this was the first time in which Galienne had appeared.  Was it the guilt she felt for having caused <a href=http://carezzia.homestead.com/files/ORB2_Still_Searching.htm>his permanent death</a>, or was he himself showing his anger from where it was Mother Tunare may have him now?   There was not a day she did not think of him, nor would there ever be such a day for the rest of her life.<br><br>Her thoughts tormented her throughout the night, her tears not allowing her rest, and when the glow of the morning sun began to sneak through her window, she had not slept a moment.<br><br><br>
