You'll note that I said one of the best - that doesn't mean it's perfect.  Can you point me to a better forum?  I am not by any means looking for "the best place for blue arsewipes to gather together and curse the faggot pks" - I hope I have made this clear enough from my previous posts on this forum (not to mention the fact that I'm level 31, Neutral and unguilded).<br><br>I do, of course, understand how you could see it that way.  Perhaps I have become too used to the "blue arsewipes" you have mentioned, and no longer take them seriously.. to the point where it makes little difference to me what "they" post, as it is almost always saying the same thing - though not always, of course.  Not all anti's or neutrals are by definition boring or unintelligent, as we've seen on this board.. imo, anyways.<br><br>I do try to find the places where actual, intelligent discussion can be made, but that doesn't mean I've found the very best place yet.  This is why I qualified my statement as being "the best general-purpose Rallos forum I *currently know of.*"<br><br>I do realize that it might not be happiness central... but where DB.com lacks coherent thoughts and where most guild forums are too centered around their own issues... RZ.net stands as a place that I see as having a reasonable mix of different viewpoints.<br><br>After all, you yourself and your guild have quite a presence on this board - one that only adds to the effect, and makes it that much more enjoyable to read.  I probably shouldn't say that, though, as you're quite good at making people mad.. <img src="/images/icons/wink.gif">
