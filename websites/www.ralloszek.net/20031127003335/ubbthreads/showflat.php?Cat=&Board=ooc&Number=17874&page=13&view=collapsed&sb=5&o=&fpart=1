An open letter to the President of the United States<br />By David Duke, National President<br />European-American Unity and Rights Organization (EURO)<br />Thursday, September 21, 2001<br /><br /><br />George W. Bush<br />President of the United States<br /><br />Dear Mr. President,<br /><br />During your passionate and truly great speech before Congress, you told us of the need to protect America against terrorism. True. You also eloquently told us of the greatness and the courage exhibited by many Americans during the crisis faced on September 11. As a former elected official who has heard thousands of speeches, I must say that yours was perhaps one of the best speeches I have heard in my lifetime.<br /><br />But, Mr. President, Sir, you also told Congress and the American people something quite inaccurate.<br /><br />I quote: <br />Americans are asking, "Why do they hate us?"<br /><br />They hate what they see right here in this chamber: a democratically elected government. Their leaders are self-appointed. They hate our freedoms: our freedom of religion, our freedom of speech, our freedom to vote and assemble and disagree with each other.<br />With all due respect to you, Mr. President, that statement is completely false. The media has said repeatedly and incorrectly that this was an attack against freedom, and unfortunately you simply repeated that absurd idea in your speech.<br /><br />The obvious truth is that those who attacked us couldn't care less about the kind of government we have. They did not attack us because they hate our democracy or our freedoms. They certainly did not attack Switzerland or Sweden or any other democracies in the world.<br /><br />I pray that you will agree with me that the American people deserve the utmost honesty before we take the most serious and dangerous step that a nation can ever make: go to war.<br /><br />The attack on September 11 was certainly not about people hating our freedoms. It was purely in response to America's foreign policy; and it was primarily about our monetary and military support of Israel.<br /><br />As strange as it may sound to Americans, those who attack us do so because they view our nation's leaders in exactly the same way as we view them. They believe that you and all of America's recent leaders are the real terrorists.<br /><br />If you want to know the true reasons why they attack America, you can easily read what they write about America. There are even many interviews with Bin Laden that make clear his motivations.<br /><br />He and many others say that they must fight America for its support of 50 years of Israel's terrorism against the Palestinian and other Mideastern people. He says this in precisely the same way that some say we must bomb Afghanistan into further oblivion for supporting the terrorism of Bin Laden.<br /><br />America is seen as a terrorist nation for having supported the Israeli ethnic cleansing of 700,000 Palestinians from their land and homes and the stripping them of their most basic human rights, even depriving them of the right to live where they were born!<br /><br />America is accused of supporting terrorism for backing Israel, even America is aware that Israel tortures 500 to 600 Palestinians in its jails each month. <br /><br />America is called terrorist for supporting Israel even as it killed 40,000 Lebanese in its invasion of that country. They ask the world how America could support Israel even as it bombed civilian Red Cross shelters and killed women and children by the score.<br /><br />Millions of people ask how the President of the United States could dine in the White House with Israel Sharon, a man with a proven history of massacring civilians, and who even Israel held responsible for the cold-blooded murder of 2000 people at the Sabra and Shatila camps in Lebanon.<br /><br />America is also called a terrorist state for causing the death of more than 500,000 Iraqi children. <br /><br />It is difficult for us to act morally superior to our enemies when our own U.S. Secretary of State, Madeline Albright, told Leslie Stahl of CBS that America's causing the death of 500,000 Iraqi children was "worth it." What would you say, Mr. President, of someone who thinks it is worth killing 500,000 children in order to punish one man?<br /><br />Of course, whatever the reasons for the attack on September 11, Americans must defend ourselves by whatever means necessary. No American should ever face such horrible terror as on that fateful black Tuesday. And, I salute your determination to defend us.<br /><br />But, before we respond in an indiscriminate way and breed even more hatred against us, we must be honest about why we are hated and why we are being attacked. <br /><br />Telling us that we were attacked simply because they hate our freedom -- keeps America from examining the real reasons why we are hated. It must be acknowledged that we cannot end the terrorism against us unless we first heal the hatred that spawns it.<br /><br />Of course, the Israel Firsters who control America's media don't want us to discuss the dire consequences of our monetary and military actions for Israel. They don't want us to even discuss the relationship between Israel and the events of September 11. Some are even telling the big lie that the attacks had nothing to do with our support of Israel. It is strange that Europe and the whole world recognize this obvious fact, but the American people do not.<br /><br />We must access the anti-American consequences of our Mideast Policy. It is vital to our own national security.<br /><br />As President, you must carefully reconsider our foreign involvement and policies over the last 50 years. You must determine if it is truly in the best interest of the American people to be involved in all these foreign wars and conflicts.<br /><br />As President you were sworn to defend the United States, not Israel or any other foreign nation. I beseech you to exclusively put first the interests of the American people. We cannot afford to be manipulated by powerful lobbies who owe their allegiance to Israel over that of America. <br /><br />You must also certainly recognize that the agenda of the Jewish-dominated news media can seriously conflict with the interests of the American people. I pray that you as our President will single-mindedly put the interests of the American people first, last and always.<br /><br />The tragic events of September 11 did not happen because people hate America's freedom. Unless we examine the root causes of the growing hatred against our country, we shall be doomed to suffer more terrible days like September 11. Let us not be drawn into the hatreds and blood feuds of foreign nations.<br /><br />May God keep and protect you Mr. President. And may he also give America and all the American people his shining protection.<br /><br />You have in your hands the most powerful sword on earth. At this critical moment in American history may God grant you the wisdom to use its power to heal rather than to inflame an even greater cycle of hate and violence against the American people. <br /><br />In whatever course of action you take, I urge you to defy the power of the Zionist lobby which serves the interests of a foreign nation, and put first the safety and interests of the American people.<br /><br />In Your Service and for America!<br /><br />David Duke

A truly moronic speech.<br /><br />1. America is not a democracy. Democratic goverments suck and none has ever suceeded.<br /><br />2. He fails to mention the fact that Isreal is not the one who refuse's to accept peace. Isreal is not the one running suicide bombers into busses. Isreal is not the one that has vowed to kill every last so called Palestinian.<br /><br />3. There is no, and never has been a nation of Palestine. Although after world war 2 the UN offered these people a nation. Isreal accepted,  they did not. They wanted ALL of Isreal to be theirs and every last Jew to be dead, and would accept nothing less. <br /><br />4. The fight over land is just false front. These people are "killing the infidels". If the true fight was over land then why is Isreal the targert?  Only 20% of the land these people are claiming is theirs is in Isreal. 80% of the land they claim is their "homeland" is in Jordan,  so why not make all this fuss with Jordan? Simple,  Jordan is not full of Jews.'<br /><br />Later<br /><br />Mawwle<br />

I want to know why Israel got such a harsh response from the US for defending themselves?   I mean we have done the same thing. We are defending our country because of Sept. 11, and I completely back it 100%.  To me Israel is doing the same thing, only they have been losing their citizens on a weekly basis for years due to suicide bombers that attack movie theaters, malls, and restaurants.   I guess I just don't understand.

Of course David Duke is going to write something so absurd. The man has been an anti-semite and klansman for years and years.<br /><br />Of course he totally neglects the reality of the Isreal/Palestine situation because it suits his purposes to paint Isreal in a "black hat". Why do the palestinians suicide bomb isreal?(HINT: its not because isreal stole their land.. arab nations in the region have more so called "palestinian" homeland then isreal.. and refuse to let them "return" and resettle it).<br /><br />Terrorists are people who strap c4 to their chest and blow up pizza parlors, busses, coffee shops etc. IMO Isreal does what it does to defend itself(though admittedly goes too far sometimes =p)

Things I find coincedental:<br />only 2 times in like last 15-20 we've gone in economic depression is when the last name of 'Bush' has been in president<br />We had little problems during Clinton, between the Bushes<br />Bush was told about the problem and he didn't do anything about it.<br />Daddy-Bush was in the CIA and lots of other things like that, and started war, or was in war with them over there, and now that Little-Bush is here, we get planes stuck in our buildings<br />Before 911, everyone made fun of Bush, didn't think he was a good president, and so on... During 911 everyone near him was saying what a good job he did, even though he didn't anything extraordinary you wouldn't see a president doing.  Now no one makes fun of him and he's a good president. What was really kinda spooky was everytime someone spoke to Laura Bush, no matter WHAT the question, she should say something to the extent of what a good job President Bush is doing, and refer to him like through the whole time, just kinda weird.<br />Seems like to me he might have had motivation<br />-note im not 100% on a lot of this stuff, but pretty sure.<br />/conspiricist theory off

Well, history is what this started from.<br />Cane killed Abel. God came down and past judgment. Cane wil never be able to plant the earth of food, and will never have a home. Thus, the Palestinians are born. Palestinians are Arabs. So, why does Iraq, Iran and so on give them land? The oldest history book in the world says that land was given to the chosen tribe, God's chosen people. The Jews. So, lets look at Duke's options. Side with Isreal? or Palestinians? Isreal never went after Palestinians with first blood. After WWII, Britain rightfully gave back the land to the jews. But the Palestins did not like it so they attacked Isreal.<br /><br />Isreal rose up and put them to bed. Now, it has begun again and Isreal has Risen to end it.During Clinton, Carter went there to settle this land dispute. Isreal gave up the west bank for peace. Palestin kept bombing... After it was all settled, Palestins kept bombing. <br /><br />Duke speaks of the Isreal murdering people. What have the Palestinians been doing for decades? Or the 10% of Arabs?<br /><br />What about Iraq raising almost 1 BILLION dollars for the terrist fams of 9/11?<br /><br />Switzerland and Sweden. They play both sides of the coin. They are not power houses. Isreal is. America is. And they have not returned BILLIONS of dollars back to the Jews. <br /><br />How many children has Iraq killed? They bomb thier own.<br /><br />Do you people realize how great the U.S.A. is? Sure we have our faults. But that is what being Human is about. <br /><br />And saying Clinton times was peacefull.... Man, you need to do some history reading on his 8 years. Look what he did to our Armed Forces. Our FBI... Our CIA... Trade towers where hit. Why was the white house street closed for 8 years? <br /><br />I just hate the Duke's of the world who start out posative. But the reall agenda is to bash Us. What are we supose to do? Let Bin laddin get away with it? If they get ride of us who is next? canada? South America? It will never end unless we end it. <br /><br />You can call us terrorist. But what are they? <br /><br /><br />-Grimance Prophylaxis.<br /><br />----Hand of Dane.<br /><br />

Out of the many who read this, many will view it as the opinions of a man named Duke.  However, the sad part is that most will not see the minor manipulations throughout the text.  David Duke has, as Danil correctly stated, been a klansman for many years.  Everything this fucker does is through his racist beliefs that one race is superior to another.  However, few readers are capable to discern propaganda from truth.<br /><br />The problem with this text is, the majority is based on truth.  In no way is it the truth, but the root of his arguments are.  However, he perverts the facts to suit his desires.<br /><br />Be wary of what you believe, be it the media, or the government, or religion.  Everyone is here to rape and use you.<br /><br />(Grimance, some religious scholars may argue on your idea of Palestinian origin.  When God punished Abel, he also marked him and his decendants, refering to darkening of skin.  Hence, black people.  And Noah's son was married to a black woman, so yes they survived the flood.  However, you'd have to be a religious individual to think about such things.)

Well, I have thouht about what you said, Equinoxe. The mark you speak of was placed upon Abel's head. People at that time could have been born any color. God made sure of that.  The mark was there to let man know that if he (Abel) is killed, you will also meet your fate.<br /><br />All of man kind spoke a common tounge. This all changed at the tower of Babalon. God become pissed. Scatered man all over the world according to color and change our language to many upon many.<br /><br /><br />-Grimance

Caltrops, daggers, swords.. even the foot of a diety isnt immune to such careless disregard.<br /><br />Moral of the story.. clean up your toys so god doesnt get pissed and destroy you.

Kolek, you do realize that whenever laws in government are passed, bills etc., that they usually don't show their effects until approximately 2 to 4 years later?  Therefore most likely, the "Bush" economic problems, as you call them, were actually brought on by the democratic president that was in office before him?  *ahem* cat-about-town Clinton?  So next election year, you can blame either the problems or the benefits of the economy on Bush, but you can't blame him for current day.

Alot of current budget, and economic issues are a direct reflection of a misinformed reaganomics style governance of the economy that Bush II has enacted. 8 years of economic growth doesnt come to a screeching halt for no reason. Say what you want about Clinton morally.. but his administration was genius with national budgeting and fostering economic growth.<br /><br />I think the attempt to blame the clinton administration for current economic woes laughable. The man was a [censored] tool.. but they did well by the US economically speaking.<br /><br />Sure.. its not ALL Bush II's fault. Sept 11 and the aftermath had a huge impact. But when you combine that with the corporate shilling, the stripping away of civil liberties at the drop of a hat, undefined and frankly murky and mostly hidden economic agendas.. People are just afraid to spend their money. End of story. They dont want to invest it.. cause the stock market [censored] sucks. They dont want to spend it.. who knows when the next national "rainy day" will be. People are sitting on their money right now.. and its all tied to *recent* events.. not policies that ended 2 years ago.

Not necessarily Bush, no. But circumstances that have occured during his presidency? Yes.<br /><br />Clinton just had the good fortune not to be in office during a major terrorist attack, the rupturing of the boil of corporate greed that has been festering long before either man was in office, and the subsequent corrosion of the stock market.

I'm tired of hearing faulty arguments about the ecomony.  The point is, you can't compare them.  Clinton had the good fortune to be president at the right time; a majority of the economic growth during his presidency had absolutely NOTHING to do with his administration.  The dot com boom played a major role in this, and even when most of those new startups failed, the new business models that had developed benefited the older, more reliable companies.  Clinton's administration was an orgy of rising stocks, and there was no way that this could keep up.<br /><br />Any decent economist will tell you that a normal stock can't stray too far from it's average mean for long.  During the Clinton era, there were stocks that had gone up in 6 times their value, even though their performance didn't reflect it.  Obviously, the prices would readjust.<br /><br />Yes, the market during Bush's term is going down.  But does it have anything to do with the president or his administration?  It's about as arbitrary as blaming the problem on the democrat controlled House.  There are too many contributing factors to really point the blame.

Danil, you know how Clinton was a 'Genius at National Budgeting?'  He stole it from SS. He put that money on the books to meet the budget each year. But hey, at least he put IOU's to replace the money. So, a little fuzzy math and a Democrat, and it will be ok ...<br /><br /><br />-Grimance Prophylaxis.
