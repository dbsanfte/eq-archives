<font class="post">
For some, the dawning of the new day brought a new beginning; for others, a long delayed rest.  For the truly weary, it was simply a reference point, one more event in a non-stop chain.  Carezzia was one of these.  She woke tired but restless, no chance of falling back to sleep, and her mind abuzz.  She rubbed the mat of sleep from the corners of her eyes and decided to forego a breakfast.<br><br>The beaten iron key unlocked the desk easily.  The lock was well oiled and the shutter of the roll-top slid open without resistance or complaint.  To the young elf's surprise, in contrast to the chaos of detritus she had found in the tray below, the surface of the desk was clean and organized, as if its contents had been deliberately ordered.  She was eerily reminded of someone setting their affairs in line like the leaving of a last will and testament.<br><br>The writing surface of the desk was a rich, polished golden wood.  The deep left corner had an inkpot nestled in a cutout in the desk's surface.  A clay mug filled with fine white sand rested alongside it.  Sheets of blank parchment waited below.  In a shallow trough beside the inkpot lay a single, well-trimmed quill.  On the opposite side of the desk rested a stack of yellowed parchments, easily eight inches high and certainly several hundred pages, each covered in precise, tiny lettering, front and back.  The writing was small but clear, almost artful, and although the letters were of the elder elfin alphabet, the words themselves were in a language unknown to her.<br><br>/this was unexpected…<br>…not really, it is his native language, after all/<br><br>Carezzia pulled a chair to the desk and carefully lifted the top sheet of the manuscript, studying it intensely.  Some of the words were the same as the elder elfin and many were similar.  With effort, she could glean the intent of the sentences by inference and context.<br><br>She reached across her body to lift the quill and paper then moved the inkpot to the other side of the desk.  Painstakingly, she began the slow task of translating the manuscript from the ancient language of the fairy.<br><br>***<br><br>Kathrin awoke to the metallic scraping sounds of the Keeper mucking stalls.  Using her arms for support, she sat up then pulled a bale of straw close enough to lean against.<br><br>"Fire's out!" she called.  If the Keeper heard her, he gave no outward sign.  A rat scurried to the edge of her pallet, its black eyes glistening wetly.  Patches of fur were gnawed away and she could see fleas crawling freely across its body.  She shivered in revulsion and it scuttled away, deeper into the cavern.<br><br>She folder her withered legs beneath her and tried to avoid looking at them too closely.  She heard footfalls and turned to watch the Keeper approach.  Wordlessly, he stacked the dark blocks of peat and rekindled the fire.  As it began to grow from spark to healthy flame, he rose and stalked away, returning in a moment later, kettle in hand.<br><br>"Running late," he grunted, placing the kettle into the blaze to heat.<br><br>"What's the Hunter's Peace?" Kathrine demanded without preamble.  It was difficult for her to read his face behind the mask but the Keeper did not appear fazed by the question.<br><br>"All things for all things and all things in balance.  It is an inescapable fact that life feeds on death and before you tell me that you eat no meat, let me remind you that plants are equally living as any beast of the field.  You look at the rat and are repulsed.  It is not comely to look upon nor appealing in its manners yet, would you prefer a world without them?  Refuse would pile up, disease would not spread and famine would result, larger beasts and birds would lack in food--no, the rat is not pretty but he is necessary." <br><br>"You defend vermin by saying they need to spread disease?"<br><br>"An imperfect example.  Still, without disease, not only would overpopulation lead to famine, but the weak would remain within the herds, prey ratios would be set askew--many bad things would occur.  In addition, being scavengers themselves, if the disease is too virulent, the rat dies, acting as a kind of natural filter.  The point remains:  even those things which we do not find obviously desirable still fulfill a vital role…even if that role is to die.  Life is fueled by death."<br><br>"Fine, keep the rats."<br><br>"Just because it is not an ecology which you understand or appreciate does not mean it is without its place in nature.  Listen:  once a man comes to accept the value of a thing, it is not long before he comes to respect the thing.  In time, he learns to see, in all things, beauty."<br><br>The kettle let out a short hiss of steam and the Keeper snatched it from the fire with his bandaged hand.  He trudged away and was absent for what seemed an eternity before returning and presenting a mug to Kathrin.<br><br>"Careful, hot.  Where was I?"<br><br>"Extolling the beauty of a rat."<br><br>"You are a disagreeable woman when you choose to be.  Now, sooner or later, a hunter faces a hard choice.  He looks at his prey and he sees all those things we have discussed.  He sees the beauty, the majesty, the sheer glory of life, and what can he do?  He has hungry children at home and he needs the meat.  He has to kill an innocent, wonderful thing because it is necessary to him.  Life is fueled by death.  That, Kathrin, is the Hunter's Peace:  to accept that part of the role of living is the dying."<br><br>"You have children?"<br><br>The Keeper laughed with an uncharacteristic pleasantry.  "Oh yes, a yard full."<br><br>"Yours or adopted?"<br><br>"Yes.  I bought the oldest from a traveling circus."<br><br>"You mock me."<br><br>"Would I lie to you?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"Then answer your own questions," the Keeper snarled, the light tone banished as quickly as it had dawned.<br><br>Another rat scuttled to the edge of the fire's glow.  This one was brown and less afflicted with parasites.  One of its front legs lay broken and twisted against its chest.  It released a short shriek then bounded back the way it had come.<br><br>The Keeper sighed and stood up from beside the fire pit.  "T'Ere is coming."<br><br>Kathrine felt the ground rushing up at her.  The Keeper steadied her before she could collapse but she hardly noticed.  Her stomach clenched into a fist and her heart hammered against her ribs.  She gasped for air like a fish on shore.<br><br>In her mind, she had known she was still a prisoner, even here in the Warrens, but it had been a distant fact, easy to ignore.  The light and proximity of animals had comforted her and the Keeper, though troublesome, was companionable in an odd sort of way.  But now, T'Ere was coming, gloating and oppressive--all the fear and anguish of years within the cage came crashing back in waves of panic and despair.  Hope given and snatched away, T'Ere had won again, hurt her again, torture without end…<br><br>"Stand fast," the Keeper was growling at her, shaking her by the shoulders.  "He can only take what you give him.  Be strong and hope.  His time of reckoning is near to hand.  Remember who you are!"<br><br>As her breathing slowed and she regained composure, he released her and moved quickly to the entrance of the cavern, intercepting T'Ere as he entered.<br><br>"High Lord T'Enel, you favor us with your presence," the Keeper said, his voice subdued, sycophantic.  As he spoke, he was backing away from T'Ere's entry, head bowed respectfully.  Without fanfare, T'Veren entered behind his Lord and leaned against a wall, watching it all in silence.<br><br>"Indeed," T'Ere purred.  "I have heard great reports of your work and certainly my beasts have never fared better in the arena."<br><br>"Sadly, Lord T'Enel, I fear your snow leopard will not be fighting again in the near future.  She is with litter from the larger specimen we obtained from Rileaus' stock, the Stonebrunt male.  I believe this will prove fortuitous.  The mixture of her speed and cunning with his size should yield a strong litter."<br><br>"I will defer to your judgment on this matter.  I'm sure you are correct.  Now, let us see to our prize patient, shall we?"<br><br>"Of course.  I have prepared a pallet and small fire for her.  It seems to improve her condition."<br><br>Kathrin drew a deep breath and held it for several seconds before releasing it as a long, soft sigh.  Something in the Keeper's admonitions rang true, steadying her.  She fixed T'Ere with an icy glare and tried to look more confident and defiant than she felt.<br><br>"Oh my," T'Ere chuckled in a pleased tone.  "You've done quite well, Keeper.  She's awake.  I've not seen my dear Kathrin so clear-eyed in years.  Have you missed me, my sweet?"<br><br>Kathrin did not trust her voice and glared her reply.<br><br>"I'm sure we'll have a chance to catch up later.  As for your Keeper, I am most impressed and he should be rewarded.  Tell me, sirrah, what boon would you ask of your lord?"<br><br>The Keeper bowed his head even deeper into his chest.  "I lack for nothing.  I ask only what you have already sworn:  that you will honor the Oaths of the Dead."<br><br>"Haha, of course,  by Innoruuk I swear.  I must say:  I find your primitive superstitions most charming.  Now, how is our patient, truly?  Already, you work miracles but the complete picture can not be so rosy.  I have already been advised that she is rather beyond repair."<br><br>"Sadly true.  I can, at best, delay the inevitable.  The cramped confines of her cage combined with muscular atrophy and malnutrition have wrought horrific damage to the very core of her structure.  Elfin bones are avian in structure.  They are hollow and excessively cartilaginous.  In the case of this elf, the bones of her lower limbs have bowed and twisted into a new configuration which, short of breaking and reforming the bones, cannot be corrected.  Given the overall poor health of the subject, I don't believe such an action would be viable.  The stress and shock to the system would probably kill her.  In addition, this same deformation is evident to a lesser extent in the rest of her body.  The spine is bowed, the ribcage has compacted, and the clavicle curves inward.  Only the arms and skull remain unaffected.  The degeneracy of the skeleton and skeletal muscle is, as far as I can tell externally, indicative of the state of her internal systems as well.  Her humours are severely out of balance, especially the sanguine.  The cardinal humours originate within the bones and the bones are fatally flawed."<br><br>T'Ere nodded as though he understood.  "And so?"<br><br>"She is dying, sooner rather than later.  Camphors and the liberal application of directed heat can aid the blood.  Sophorics can dull the pain.  With birch teas and alcohols, I can thin the blood and diffuse the contentious and melancholy humours."  The Keeper spread his hands as if to show them empty.  "I can delay the inevitable fatal clot but she will die.  She is deceptively fragile.  Harsh treatment, especially to the lower extremities, or even a short fall runs the very real immediate risk of broken bones which, at this juncture, would equally fatal."<br><br>"How long can you keep her alive and awake?"<br><br>"If you put her back in a cage in the dark, as little as a month."<br><br>"And if I leave her here, under your care?"<br><br>"I would not deceive you on this--it is an imprecise study, I can make no guarantees.  Six months to a year, perhaps even longer, I cannot say."<br><br>T'Ere turned his gaze back to Kathrin.  "Then I suppose I shall have to leave you here and visit often.  It's good to see you awake again, pet.  I'd hate for you to miss even a moment of my revenge."  He returned his attention to the Keeper.  "You've done well and shall continue.  You will join me for dinner, of course."<br><br>"Of course."<br><br>"I shall have appropriate dress brought to you.  Come, T'Veren, my visit here is concluded."<br><br>With a final, sweeping gaze, T'Veren followed his Lord as the two exited the cavern.  The Keeper stood immobile for long minutes, waiting, before slowly pulling himself fully upright, uncoiling from the servile bow and releasing an angry hiss from between his teeth.<br><br>"What are the Oaths of the Dead?" Kathrin asked, unable to stand the stillness.<br><br>"In the early days after the Sundering, cannibalism, especially the consumption of those recently deceased from natural causes, was common among the Teir'Dal.  Frequently, Lords would foreswear the act, often at the request of their retainers; presumably because those same retainer would be the first meals in difficult times.  There are remnants that hold to the practice of the oath-giving to this day."<br><br>"And you are one of them."<br><br>"Me?  If it's already dead, seems a waste not to use it.  But I have made it important to T'Ere."  The Keepers voice was heavy with cynical amusement.  "I've work to do now.  My day is cut short by T'Ere's whims again."<br><br>"I won't ever walk again, will I?" blurted Kathrin before he could move away.<br><br>"No.  I'm sorry, but no."<br><br>"And, what you told T'Ere, about my health, about my dying…"<br><br>"Every word the truth," the Keeper replied gently.<br><br>"The Hunter's Peace on this, then," she said at last.  The Keeper turned without answering and walked deeper into the cavern.<br><br>***<br><br>"Any quest for truth must begin with assumptions.  These assumptions are of an intuitive nature and any arguments for their validity are, by definition, circular.  First and foremost, one must assume and accept the existence of a rational universe.  Lacking a base assumption of reason, we would be left without tools to analyze the world around us, both physically and metaphysically.  The second assumption is that the tools of reason are sufficient to discern truth.  It is intuitively obvious that some truths may be determined by reason, at least on a functional level.  Lacking alternatives, we must proceed on the acceptance of reason as our instrument of discernment.<br><br>"Following this, the weapons of our war chest are words.  Words mean things and we must use and accept them as the tools they are.  Most importantly, the understanding of a thing begins with the understanding of its origins and/or its definitions.  I am, at this point, not yet convinced that origins and definitions are not, in the larger sense, the same thing.  For the sake of clarity, I refer to them separately."<br><br>Carezzia laid the quill aside and rubbed the bridge of her nose, heedless of the ink on her fingers.  She had spent the better part of two days struggling to grasp the general contents of the fairy manuscript.  She had returned to the beginning to attempt a true translation of the text and had spent the better part of the morning fighting through the pedantic lecture.  Already, she was exhausted and had barely scratched the surface of the text.<br><br>The work appeared to be a mixture of an autobiographical journal and a philosophical treatise.  The overweening theme was the permanent quest for truth, presented with rhetorical deductions, personal observations, and even examples of personal failures brought forth to illustrate key points.  It was a quest for truth, and a better way of life.  The most surprising thing to Carezzia was that the work was not about truth but the mindset and tools for the quest.<br><br>Carezzia sighed.  "But I can't translate it," she said aloud.  "Not all at once and not without help."  She had started out on a quest of her own, trying to understand her own place in the world.  She had been sidetracked, dead-ended.  Now her search to learn more of the Ancient of Days had become mired in its own set of problems and distractions.  Perhaps that was why the elder druid had written more of how to search rather than what he had found.  Perhaps the search was all there was.<br><br>Definitions and origins--that was what she needed to know, what she had set out to learn about herself.  She had gained tools along her travels--contacts she would not otherwise have met, concepts she would never have learned otherwise--and, in hindsight, she realized that she had not been ready to face what her quest would unearth.  It was time to return to her original quest:  to find herself.<br><br>But where to begin?  Quildluane was dead and her surviving family was too far removed to be of assistance.  Everyone who had known her parents or her caretaker were long dead, buried in the mists of history and their secrets gone with them.  Quildluane had kept no ties with the outside world while raising her.  There was no one…<br><br>No, she corrected herself, that was not true.  Definitions and origins--she smiled at the irony.  Her search had come full circle, mentally and physically.  There was one person who had known of both herself and of Quildluane.  It was time to return to Lesser Feydark and the fairy.<br><br>***<br><br>T'Veren was impressed with the improvements made to the Keeper's appearance.  The motley of rags had been replaced, or covered, by a simple black robe of a cut similar to that worn by the Prophets.  The sleeves were long, draping to points and hiding the Keeper's maimed hand.  The cowl of the robe was seamed, giving it a small peak at the back, hiding the Keeper's face without appearing dilapidated.  A new mask of polished mithral gleamed beneath the hood, the space around the mouth and chin notched out to reveal a scraggly beard.  The dark color of the robe made the menial less obtrusive and he seemed content to eat quietly, alone in a corner, occasionally standing to intercept the servers as they entered or left the room when he had a need.<br><br>Freed from concern over the Keeper, T'Veren devoted much of his attention to the front table itself.  The addition of the Rileaus child had, in T'Veren's opinion, heightened the tension between T'Ere and Even'gel.  For almost as long as they had been together, Even'gel's overly dramatic demands for her husband's attention was balanced against T'Ere's propensity for working and plotting obsessively.  The death of their first and only child early in their marriage had galvanized the emotional tug-of-war into a permanent state.  T'Ere would obsess on some project to the exclusion of all else.  Even' would cry and act hysterically until T'Ere's temper caused him to explode at her.  They would fight, viciously, T'Veren suspected physically at times.  T'Ere would spend the next few weeks indulging his wife's every compulsive whim as they made peace with each other, then the entire cycle would begin again.  Far from optimal; but stable and predictable and thus, to T'Veren, acceptable.<br><br>Rene had changed the dynamic.  Even'gel had always cried to her maids, but they were servants and, therefore, insufficient as an audience for her travails.  This, of course, brought her back to T'Ere, where she would continue her performances until his patience was exhausted and the shouting began.  With Rene, she had found an acceptable and 'safe' audience.  By all reports, the boy was receptive and encouraging to her, but the child's hatred of T'Ere was readily apparent to T'Veren.  Unaware and unconcerned, T'Ere ignored it all as Even'gel's cycle of passive aggression bypassed its normal release point, and began to build into a resentment which, T'Veren feared, would be truly dangerous if not addressed--and soon.<br><br>T'Ere, as usual, believed his cousin's concerns unfounded and overly pessimistic.  The boy was a welcome distraction for Even'; so long as she left him undisturbed, T'Ere saw no reason for worry, much less discussion or action.  T'Veren had already begun to consider having the boy killed but the situation with the other houses was too volatile for such an overt approach.  <br><br>T'Veren's musings were interrupted by a harsh hacking; a dog choking on a bone, not unusual in the large dining hall until Even'gel's shrieks of dismay indicated that the beast in question was not a dog but The Dog.  As the hacking cough shifted to a choking gurgle, the shrieks escalated into screams and the hall's occupants shifted and pressed forward, trying to see.  T'Veren moved to stand behind T'Ere's shoulder, watching the hound and guarding T'Ere's back.  He hoped the spoiled pet would simply die and be done with it.<br><br>The Keeper shoved through the milling onlookers, heedless of rank or propriety.  He balled the long sleeve of his robe around his already bandaged hand and thrust it into the creature's maw, forcing its jaws apart, then shoved it down onto its side, convulsing and choking.  He forced his other hand into the dog's throat then wrenched it out in a shower of saliva and blood.  The dog's struggles were growing weaker and a torrent of watery, pink liquid ran from its mouth and nose.<br><br>"A wire!  I need wire!  Thin metal!"  the Keeper demanded and, without hesitation, Even'gel pulled free the long pin holding her hair and passed it to him.  The menial placed a boot heel on it and twisted it upward with his free hand, forming a crude hook.  Within seconds, he was again deep in the dog's throat.  Giving a grunt and jerk, he tore something free within the hound and a wave of bloody mucous vomited out of the dog's jaws and it began to breathe again, a rasping wet sound.  It lay on its side, glassy-eyed and panting shallowly, a thin pink stream of blood and mucous seeping from its nostrils.<br><br>"We'll have to be extra careful with him.  The throat is torn badly but the crisis is past," the Keeper said to no one in particular, then lifted a bloody hand to inspect the bone he had extracted from the dog's gullet.<br><br>Even'gel threw her arms around the hound and began to sob in relief.  T'Ere moved to comfort her but Rene reached her first, almost but not quite shouldering the High Lord aside.  T'Ere seemed not to notice and turned instead to speak to the Keeper; but T'Veren saw more in Rene's actions than simple concern.  He pressed his lips tightly together and nodded to himself.  The boy would have to be dealt with.<br><br>
