1) We have no desire to be part of a "community" with you -- You're nothing but a bowl of fruit to us.<br /><br />2) What does the number of kills have to do with my (accurate) statement?<br /><br />3) Would you happen to be one of those talentless coattail riders I refered to? You are, aren't you? ;-)<br /><br />4) We have no desire to "be" DB, you nincompoop. Gavotte was still an RP necro, Phreeze was still an Anti monk, Hammy had yet to learn the first thing about resists/pumice in PvP... And most of the other folks which eventually made DB semi-respectable were quite happily killing them off for being the cheap ganks they were (and actually aspired to be) at the time of AD's creation. We set out to prove that "PKing" didn't have to be done thusly -- And we have.<br /><br />Why on earth would we want to become something which was the total opposite of the principles we were founded upon (except the killing your bitch ass part)?<br /><br />5) If it'll make you feel any better.. We can take our tags down once a week, bag up our gear and gank your half-dead bitch ass rather than warn you before we do it in a jovial, joking manner -- I can even call you a turd and crack a few comments about what a whore your mother is, if you like.<br /><br />/chuckles<br /><br />If sheer numbers is all it takes to dazzle you, pissant, you are going to be in for a rude awakening when one or two Artists decimate your entire guild/group/raid someday -- Lots of others have... And they are in the same bowl or rotting fruit which you inhabit<br /><br />(Note: In case it went over your head... That last part is a <i>classy</i> "fvck u turd &amp; tell ur m0m 2 wipe my jizz offa her chin" -- No need to thank me for the nostalgia.)<br /><br />Artfully Yours,<br /><br />Nnuk<br />Master of the Arts<br /><a target="_blank" href=http://www.artfuldeath.com>Artful Death Gallery</a>
