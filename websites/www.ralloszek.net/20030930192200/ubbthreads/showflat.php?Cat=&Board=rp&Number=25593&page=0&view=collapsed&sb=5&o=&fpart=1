Ok,is this roleplay? prolly not.But it is a short story based on Everquest.I have used names of some of my characters,and NPC names,and Everquest locales and themes.I have also used ficticious names in it.If any ficticious name in here resembles the names of any player character besides my own it is purely coincidental and unintended.<br /><br />Okay.now why i wrote it?I drive a vehicle for 8 hours a night,and i get bored,i'm always thinking up story possibilities anyways,so i made up some with my EQ chars as characters.This is like the 4th one i made up,i just made a rough outline,and im kinda working off it.<br /><br />I just feel like doing it,I'm not a writer or nothing.<br /><br />___________________________________________________ The Iron-bound Tome.<br /><br />   Kyzolkain is a gnome.In his youth,he stuck to his studies,and became quite a talented linguist.Like many gnomes,he sought his fortune in the lands outside of Ak'Anon.He was able to make a living selling his services as an interpreter to many of the important people of Norrath.He eventually made his way to Rivervale,home of the halflings.<br /> While at Rivervale,he became a messenger for Mayor Gubbins.The Mayor was paying him well to deliver messages to the Muddites and humans in the outlying lands.This was Kyzolkains undoing,as he spent all his money gambling at the Fool's Gold tavern.He ended up owing quite a debt to the Deeppockets.When they sent someone to collect,they realized the gnome had vanished.This brings us to the beginning of this tale.<br />-------------------------------------------------------------<br />  Kyzolkain needed the help of a thief.He needed something acquired from High Hold Keep.Unfortunately,he had made enemies with the Deeppockets,so he couldn't ask their help.A friend tipped him off that a thief could be found in Kithicor Forest.So keeping a watchful eye,he ventured into the forest,alone.<br /><br />Kyzolkain had heard the tales of this forest,but he knew how much time he had before nightfall,and he knew when he would have to turn back.He also had a vague idea where to find the thief,so he knew everything was in his favor.<br /><br />After a short time,he walked into a clearing,and saw a halfling girl picking fruit and putting it in a basket.Kyzolkain said to her"Hullo,young girl."The girl slowly turned and gave a cautious eye.Kyzolkain then said " Hey,I have come here because I need the services of a thief,can you help me?"The girl looked at him for a second then said"Hmm,I can help you,but you must stay right here,you have been being watched for awhile now.Don't try to follow me,I will bring you a thief."<br /><br />Kyzolkain rested then after that,and had a bite of lunch.He was just starting to worry that noone was coming,and he would have to turn back,when he heard voices.All at once he found himself surrounded by people,with blades drawn.He saw the girl,her basket replaced with a sword.He then saw a vicious looking half elf,smiling as he made slicing motions with a cruel looking knife.Worst of all,behind him loomed the grotesque image of a huge troll,wielding a battle axe.Kyzolkain looked around and stammered,"I,I,..I was told to come here to find a thief,I,I mean no harm...".At this a halfling came walking out of the bushes,he replied"A thief you say?Heh,I am a thief.You will never leave this place if we wish it.State your business here,nightfall approaches."<br />  So Kyzolkain said," I need a thief to bring me a certain book that Lozani keeps in his library in High Hold Keep.I will pay you well to bring it to me,though i have no money with me right now."Then the Half-elf replied,"Yes,there are thieves <br />about,its wise to hide your cash.""True enough,lets confer on this matter.Gnome,stand back but stay in sight",said the halfling.The troll then stood watch while the other three spoke among themselves for a bit.Finally,they all seemed to reach agreement,and came back to where Kyzolkain was standing.The halfling then asked,"So how much does this job pay?Seems risky,I'd hate to retrieve this item only to turn and see an angry Lozani glaring at me."Kyzolkain said"I will pay you 100 platinum for its return."All the thieves laughed."100 platinum?" says the halfling.Kyzolkain then said"If that is not enough,I can always seek help with the smugglers in Highpass".More laughter ensued."Highpass?If you go to the smugglers there,you will wake up in prison with ol' Big Dick Osargen."sneered the half elf.At that point,the halfling girl pointed at the sky,"Its near enough dark,lets get moving,we can take the gnome with us or leave him here,but I'm not getting caught out here after dark."she stated,to which the halfling replied,"You are right,O.K. gnome,I will retrieve your book,but for 200 Platinum,but I suggest you stay with us for the night.This is nowhere to be."Kyzolkain agreed,so the thieves blindfolded him and led him to their hideout.<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Later,when they had reached the hideout,a dark cave,with stout doors onb the front,the gnome and the thieves made their introductions."I am called Kyzolkain",the gnome stated.To which the halfling replied "Yeah,we know all about ya,hehe.""Okay,I am named Wake,the elf there is Micalini,this here is my sister Rhoole,and our big friend here is called Evoe.Nice to make your acquaintance",said Wake.<br />"Well,I'm glad you brought me here,though I was afraid I'd get a knife in my back,while you had me blindfolded,hehe."said Kyzolkain."Hey,may I ask,what land are we in?Are we in the commonlands?"he asked.<br />Wake replied"No,we are still in Kith,don't worry we are plenty safe here.It seems the skeletons can't reach this place.Our people been using this spot for a long time,decades.Long before any of us you see here was born.We call ourselves the orphans of the forest,all of us lost our parents long ago.Parentless children are seen as a nuisance,so they get chased into the wilderness,this happened to us all.Each of us found our way here,and now this is the only family we need."<br />  Then Micalini said,"Yeah,so we get to live here,where noone can fuck with us.Its hard life sometimes,but we get by,living off the land,and waylaying travelers.As to why the skeletons don't come here,I think its because this part of the forest didn't exist when Innoruuk laid his curse.I think these caves opened up much later,at least thats what the Shraloks tell us,hehe.Them Shraloks,we truce with them out here,none of us wants to get caught out after dark."<br />Then Rhoole said"Bah,all this talk,we only just brought this gnome here,and you are telling him the history of the world.The soups almost done so shut your stupid faces and eat."<br /><br />During the supper the orphans and Kyzolkain discussed plans for the raid on High Hold Keep.Micalini said"Theres only one way to do this Wake,me and Rhoole,we'll go there in the morning and by supplies.That will give us an alibi for being there.Then you meet us there after dark,I will cause a diversion,likely involving goblins in the cellar.This should give you time to retrieve the book.Me an Rhoole will go to the Karanas and get skins and such,and sell them in the pass in the morning,this will take suspicion off us.By then you will return here with the book,and we will come back.Then we just get the money fron Kyz here,and we'll be knee-deep in whores by nightfall hehe.Uhh,sorry Rhoole."Rhoole shot him an evil glance.<br />  Then Evoe said,"Whats 'bout me?What'll I do?"<br /> "Heh,you will get to stay here and keep our guest company.Don't eat him either." replied Wake."All in all,it sounds like a good plan.It should go off without a hitch.",he said.<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Early the next morning Rhoole and Micalini departed to the Pass to buy supplies.Wake went there a little later,and hid close to the keep to await nightfall.After it was dark,he met Micalini by the keep.Micalini whispered"O.K.,its time bro.You get up by Lozanis room,I'll go wake up the goblins.When you hear the screaming,and all the guards run downstairs,then go for the book.I'm going to run all the way to the Karanas and meet Rhoole there.I won't be around to help you if you get in trouble.Just be careful,I'll meet you at home tomorrow,we will be a damn sight richer by then hehe."The two then made their way into the keep.<br /><br />Wake made his way slowly to the upper floors of the keep.He soon found himself outside Lozanis room.By pure luck,the doors were unlocked.Fearing a trap,he quietly entered the room.At this point,he heard a major commotion in the lower floors of the Keep.Soon the guards were everywhere rushing to the lower floors,and Wake heard the screams and the crash of battle.Now he knew it was time to make his move.<br />  When he entered the inner chamber the 1st thing he saw was Lozani asleep on a couch.He froze for a second,then scanned the room for the bookshelf.He saw the Tome Kyzolkain had described right off.He paused for a second,"This is too easy" he thought.So he then slipped across the room,grabbed the book,and crept back out of the chamber.Once outside,he made haste to exit the keep.It sounded like the guards were getting things under control."I did it!!" Wake thought to himself.<br />Wakes journey back out of the pass went without incident.He knew the hard part was coming up,he would have to sneak through the forest at night.Any Rogue worth his salt had nothing to fear from the skeletons in the forest if he was careful.<br /> <br />As Wake reached the forest,he stopped for a second to catch a breather.Immediately he was surrounded by Halflings,with their blades drawn.He too drew his blades.A torch was lit up,and Wake saw two rogues he knew,as well as a fierce looking rogue he didn't know."Heber Drunery,and Rueppy Kutpurse,why are you two stopping me here?What is this?" said Wake.<br />Heber Drunery said,"Its simple,you have something which belongs to us,Wake."With this,tempers flared again,and the four halflings shouted and glared at each other.<br />"Silence,silence." said Heber."We have been waiting here for you for hours,give us the tome so that we may leave.Give us the Tome,killing you isn't our plan."he said.<br />Then Rueppy spoke up,"But killing you would be very easy at this point,the choice is yours,you dimwitted buffoon."<br />Wake replied," Bah,damn it all,how the hell did you all find me here?How the hell you even know what we was about?"<br />Heber said "That was easy enough,we just had our friend Miblunn here track Kyzolkain down,he discovered your plans and told us of it.Kyzolkain owes us alot of money,and he hasn't been straight with you.That Tome is worth alot more money than he offered to you,by right its ours because of the debt he owes us.Now hand it over,and you will be forgiven for helping our enemy."<br />Wake studied the strange halfling they referred to as Miblunn for a second then he said;"Here is the stupid book.I hope you choke on it.This is far from over."He reluctantly handed the book to Heber.With this,all the rogues simultaneously melted into the shadows.<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Later the next day the orphans regrouped at their base.Wake informed them of what happened.Everyone was disappointed by the news.<br />Micalini said,"Huh?We gotta do something 'bout this."<br />Evoe said,"Lets go,and burn their houses down."<br />Wake said,"I'm gonna go there and see Lendel,I want to hear what he says about it."<br />Rhoole spoke up and said"No,don't go,they may try to kill you!!"<br />"Heh,they won't try to kill me in town,they wouldn't risk that,it would raise too many questions"said Wake."I'm gonna go.I got to at least get this off my chest.I want all of you to wait outside Rivervale for me,I'm working an idea I'll tell you on the way.<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />  Lendel Deeppockets was teaching his young son to pick locks when his son happened to look out the window and said,"Father,there is a sinister looking man out front."<br /> Then Heber Drunery came in the room,he said,"Lendel,its Wake,he says he wants to talk to you.Shall I send him off?"<br />Lendel replied,"No,I better speak with him,he respects me,I'm sure I can get him to see our side of things,in fact,I may be able to get him to lead us to Kyzolkain."<br /><br />Lendel walked outside of Fool's Gold,and saw Wake pacing around."Hail Wake," he said.Wake walked over glaring at Lendel."Wake,look,we had to take the book.Do you even know what its worth?The man Kyzolkain was going to sell it to will pay 10,000 platinum for it.You can't trust Kyzolkain,bud.He was only going to find a way to set you up,just like he set us up.You gotta believe that.We did you a favor by taking it," said Lendel.Wake glared at Lendel still."Look,I know you are angry,but come back here in a few days,I will give you a small cut of the money,its only fair,but I can't have you walking around here stirring up trouble,people are watching us even now.Leave,think about what I said,you will see the truth of it."<br />Wake said,"Okay then,I will leave for now.I just don't like Heber waylaying me,I'll think about what you said."Wake then returned to his friends in Kithicor.<br />When Wake got back,he said,"O.K.,heres the deal,Micalini,spy on them,noone has better ears than you,plus you aren't known there,you're a bard just sit out front an play a tune,act like a beggar.We need to find out where they are taking the book.Evoe,go to the old hill,you know which one.Rhoole is already in position,lets go"They all went their respective ways.<br />  Wake knew that Miblunn would be tracking him,so he went to where Rhoole was at.He walked up to where she was standing on a rock,then she went on ahead,and he climbed a tree to get a better look.with any luck,he knew the plot may fool Miblunn.<br />While Wake was up in the tree,he started getting doubts.He knew the plot would never fool a Ranger.He even thought Miblunn may be smart enough to pretend he wasn't aware,and so trick Wake back.But wake also knew Miblunn was a rogue,so he thought there may be a chance at an easy kill.<br />Before too long Wake spied Miblunn sneaking down the path,following the trail.When he came to the rock,he stopped,found the trail and kept going."Now is my chance," Wake thought.<br /> Wake leapt down from the tree,and aimed a vicious cut at Miblunns head.At the last possible second,Miblunn became aware he was under attack,and barely dodged the blow.Miblunn snarled with rage as he drew his daggers.The fighting was fierce from then on.Each halfling was raining blows on the other,but they kept blocking each other out.Constantly slashing,and ducking blows,the two fought their way into a clearing.Here Miblunn stabbed twice at Wakes head,forcing wake to bring his daggers up to parry.Then he slashed again,and scratched Wakes arm.Immediately the wound started burning,"Poison!!" Wake thought.Wake had to fight back,he started jabbing at Mibbluns stomache,to bring his daggers low.Then Miblunn made a long stab at Wake,but left hisself open.Wake shoved a dagger in Miblunns throat,then spun behind him,and stabbed his other dagger deep between Miblunns shoulderblades.Miblunn fell to the ground dead.<br />By this time,Rhoole had doubled back,and she checked the poison scratch on Wakes arm."Nothing serious,"she said,"It'll just hurt like hell a few days."<br />Near exhaustion Wake said,"Lets strip his body of valuables,so Evoe can dump him in the pit.I need to go rest,we'll wait for Micalini there,and see what plans to make next."<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Later that day Micalini returned,"I've got great news,they're sending Heber to East Commons to deliver the book.We can trap him!!!"<br />Kyzolkain said,"They are fools,the man who wants the book will kill him."<br />Wake said,"I heard about this man,I heard you will get 10,000 platinum for the book.Now you need to tell us about this man."<br />Kyzolkain was silent for a moment,then he said,"Its true I havent been entirely truthful with you.You see?I owe the man who wants the book much money,its only in exchange for my life that I give the book to him.I have been working off my debt to him for some time.10,000 platinum?I will get nothing for the book,but I will get to live.Fear not,I still have plenty of money to pay you for returning me the book."<br />"Fair enough,"Wake said"I believe you,I think Lendel was only lying to me,to lower my trust in you."<br />Now was time to make the plans to get the book back.Micalini said"I overheard them talking,they are sending Heber to deliver the book.It seems they have already contacted the buyer.Its a dark elf from Neriak.So they are meeting at Dolman's Inn in East Commons.This is a great stroke of luck,as I know Dolman well,and he will help us."<br />"Really?You think so?"said Wake,"Well hot damn,we got a trip to make!!"<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Heber Drunery's trip to East Commons was fairly uneventful,though he was a little worried about his trip through Kithicor,even with the escort.The last man they had sent through Kith never returned."Poor Mublinn,"thought Heber,but really he had his own safety to think of.He breathed alot easier when he reached the West Commons.Here the escort left him.It was common knowledge that one rogue worked better than many.<br /> His trip through the western part of the commonlands went equally well,although he did have to hide from a party of orcs once.He was making good time still,and figured he'd make it to the drop right on time.<br />Finally,he entered the East Commons,here it was just a short walk to the Inn he would stay at.<br /> When he arrived at the Inn he hailed the caretaker.He said,"Do you have a spare room for a tired traveller?"The Innkeep said,"Yes.I sure do,its the last room on the left,you can't miss it."Heber payed and thanked the man,then went on to his room.<br /> Heber entered the room,and lit a candle.He was immediately surrounded by people with their blades drawn.He glanced around,not recognizing any of them.Worst of all one of them was a huge Troll,looking like he hadn't ate in weeks.Heber managed to hold his composure and said,"What is this?What do you want from me?"<br />At this point Wake walked out of the shadows with a triumphant look in his eye and said,"Its simple,Heber,you have something which belongs to us."<br />The cussing which then ensued isn't repeatable here."You won't get away with this Wake,we will be watching for you now,you will pay for this!!!!"<br />Wake took the book from Heber and signaled that it was time to go."Enjoy your rest here tonight,Heber,its a long journey back to Rivervale."With that the orphans exited out the window,leaving behind a very angry halfling.<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />After recieving the book,Kyzolkain gave 400 platinum to Wake and his friends.Before he departed,he said."I can't thank you enough for what you have done for me,you have saved my life for sure,and now I will finally be able to win my freedom.If ever I pass this way again,I will be sure to pay my respects to you."With that,he walked away,never to be seen again.<br />Evoe said,"I liked that gnome,he told me lots of stuff while you guys were in High Keep."<br />"Yeah,I had my misgivings at first but it paid out in the end."said Rhoole."But do you think the Fools Gold crowd will give us trouble now?"<br />Wake replied"Nah,Heber won't admit he was bested by a bunch of young kids.He'll likely come up with some story."<br />"Who gives a shit?",said Micalini,"We got some spending to do,lets go get drunk,we get 100 plat each hehe.Theys whores a plenty in Freeport,lets go!!!!"<br />With that they all headed to Freeport.<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />The damn end.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Oh well,that took a long time.I know it needs grammatical work and such,but remember,i'm no writer.
