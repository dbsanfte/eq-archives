<br>
<br>She traveled only under the protection of night, for her upbringing had demanded so. Memories and thoughts flooded through her mind as she chose to travel by foot rather than through gateways of time. Five years had passed since Lulee met with Descourg. It was on a night that would forever change life as she had known it.
<br>
<br>&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;
<br>
<br>He had been sick for what seemed an eternity to her. His face had turned from a spirited young dark elf to that of a helpless soul. Saelaeldar had fallen ill just a few days back and had remained bedridden since.
<br>
<br>“How is he?”
<br>
<br>“I don’t believe he will make it past tonight….”
<br>
<br>“Get out of my sight!”
<br>
<br>Her voice trembled as she sought to contain herself for fear of being overheard. The cleric walked away, shaking his head and apologizing in whispers, as he disappeared into the darkness. Lulee held her composure as she walked into the room. His eyes slightly opened.
<br>
<br>“Lulee?”
<br>
<br>“Yes dear, it is me.”
<br>
<br>Saelaeldar smiled as the door closed behind her. Lulee lit a candle and placed it near his bedside, his gaze never leaving her sight. She turned to him and placed her finger up towards the sky while he watched intently. Her finger traced an invisible symbol into the air as a soft wind blew through the window. He closed his eyes and opened them to find a female dark elf standing in place where Lulee had been.
<br>
<br>“I love your tricks lulu. You bring me happiness, but I grow weary.”
<br>
<br>“Nonsense! You’re doing just fine.”
<br>
<br>“Am I? What did the cleric say?”
<br>
<br>“He said you are recovering as expected. He had to visit to another patient.”
<br>
<br>“I see.”
<br>
<br>Lulee blew out the candle and sat down next to him. She leaned down towards him and placed a single kiss on his forehead.
<br>
<br>“You need your rest. I will stay here until you fall asleep.”
<br>
<br>“Ahhh lulu, you have always watched over me so. Good night my darling.”
<br>
<br>“Good night my love.”
