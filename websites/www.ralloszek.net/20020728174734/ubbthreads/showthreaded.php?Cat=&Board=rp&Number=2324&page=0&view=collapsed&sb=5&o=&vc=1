--What to do, what to do?  It is not my custom to go where I am not comfortable and without clear invitation but, the fabled Carezzia has requested (ordered, begged, demanded) that I move my small tales to this most noble of forums.  It is one of my failings that I deny my favorites of very few of their requests.  Ah, but the tale is long, some three full arcs already, tens of thousands of words, and I am a stickler for continuity and foreshadowing.  What to do, what to do?  So, a compromise of sorts--I give you a bit of  prologue (probably incomprehensible), tiny fragments of the whole.  And, should these tales prove too burdensome and poorly crafted for the august company the fable Carezzia has thrust me into, I shall retire quietly upon request.  <br><br>Behold:  that which has gone before--<br><br>[Descourge returns to the friends of his childhood after an absence of several decades]--     The man, or whatever it was that the foliage revealed, was crouched forward, kneeling beneath a heavy cloak.  He leaned against a worn farmer's scythe, the tools recurving blade forming what Kaolinn had at first perceived as the switchback limb.  Between the heavy leathered cloak and the grey hair that fell to nearly the man's waist--unkempt and wild, almost like a mane formed of feathers--he appeared even less descript than the tree which preceded him.<br>     The paladin chose the pitch of his voice carefully, stern but not overly aggressive.  "Sir?  Sir, are you well?"<br>     The reaction was unexpected and extreme.  The man surged to his feet, head thrown back, shoulders high, his arms thrust far away from his body, the fingers of his free hand spread wide like claws.  He released a growl that escalated rapidly through the menacing hiss of a snake to the feral challenge of an injured puma.<br>     At the final sound, Kaolinn relaxed slightly, memory lending comfort.  This was no immediate threat.  "Des?" he inquired tentatively.  At the name, the man swiveled his head, birdlike, toward the speaker.  The man's facial hair was as wild and overgrown as the rest.  His face was scarred with windburn and his skin had almost a blue pallor.  When he slowly opened his eyes, Kaolinn could see that they were a milk white, unseeing.  The man blinked his blind eyes twice and then, to Kaolinn's amazement, the opaque film broke lose at the top of the eyes and slid beneath the lower eyelid to reveal hollow grey eyes split with the vertical pupils of a cat.<br>     "Nictitating membrane?" the paladin whispered in disbelief.  The other man's reply was physical, he collapsed in on himself, lowering his head, pulling his arms back to the core of his body.  He dipped his head into the crook of his shoulder and turned partially away.<br>     "Des, I'm not an animal.  I need you to speak to me if you want me to understand."<br>     If the reply was in words, it was no language used by men.  The one called Des thrust out his jaw and released a series of almost musical noises, like elongated bird calls, his larynx bobbing in his throat, straining at sounds not meant for human voice.  Seeing no comprehension, the druid switched to another tongue, this one harsh, guttural and sibilant but still unknown to his listener.<br>     "Come on, Des.  You should remember this."<br>     The druid favored Kaolinn with a disapproving glare before speaking in a rough, faded whisper.  "The language of pain.  It is not my preference." <br><br>[The displaced Ancient, having extreme difficulty returning to the human world, seeks advice from his family]--     Descourge stood, shrouded in the fog at the front of the little house, and wished he was a boy again.  He wished that he could run to his mother like a frightened child with a skinned knee that she would kiss and, once again, everything would be right within his world.  Then he grimaced at the lies he told himself.  He had been a Surefall orphan--Surefall:  the distant place where the elite of Felwithe sent their disgraced daughters to whelp their half-breed mistakes and then return, forgetful, to their cultured, uncluttered lives.  He had grown to manhood with no mother, no father beyond Karana, only trainers and the beasts.  As a young druid, he had traveled the world, looking for answers to fill that one, great, gaping hole which he could not even define.  In the frozen wastes, he had found a measure of peace.  On the great plains and the desert sands, he had found the clean pleasures of the hunt.  In the so-called homeland of the elfin peoples, he found disdain and oh-so-polite condescension.   And eventually, among the fading ruins of a forgotten people, among a race as orphaned as he, Descourge had found a place and a family, not of blood, but of choice.  It was here, in the mists of the woods of Lesser Feydark, that Joleena had found room in her heart for one more foundling and named him son and member of the fairy court.<br>     He knocked once then opened the door into the mushroom building.  Stooping, he stepped inside.  "Mother?"<br>     "In the kitchen, Dessie."  The reply was in the lilting speech of the fairy and, unconsciously, Descourge switched to the ancient tongue.  He moved to join her in the other room.<br>     "Presents," the druid commented and placed a packet on the table in the center of the small dining room.  Delicately, he kissed his mother on a blue cheek.  Joleena was barely a fifth of her son's height, her skin the blue of a spring sky, her hair the golden flax of corn silks, and two small wings fluttered on her back, bearing her aloft.  Despite their physical differences, the ease with which they moved and spoke with the other made it clear that they were family. /snip/<br>     To his surprise, his mother laughed at his discomfort.  "You and I are too much alike.  Your children are grown.  Your duties are done.  Your house is empty.  You've earned the rest but you don't know how to not be doing something.  Oh, Dessie, I do understand all too well."<br>/snip/<br>     "All right then.  I'm sorry, Mother.  I must go."<br>     "Be careful," she whispered and kissed him quickly on the cheek.  "I'll send your attendants on ahead."<br>     "I don't need attendants."<br>     "I'll not hear of it.  You are a noble of the court.  It gives them honor to serve you.  Now hurry off, I'll drink your tea for you."<br>     "Thank you," he replied with a sad smile and strode purposefully from the house.<br>     Joleena watched him go in silence then muttered to herself, "I'm not sure that one will ever be settled."<br><br>[The Ancient begins to pursue matters related to ancient obligations and the fey court, specific among these, the location of Carezzia who's relevance to the Fairy is not revealed]-- I didn't know how I was going to find Carezzia; I wasn't even sure she needed finding.  Sometimes a man follows his gut and thinks it through later. <br>/snip/ <br>Sooner or later, every druid, maybe everyone else too for all I know, has to go looking for themselves.  We call it the Green, named after the emerald flash at twilight, but it really is a vision-quest with very few set limits.  The reason is simple:  at some point as a druid grows up, they stop being who their trainers and family taught them to be, and they start being who they are.  Even if it turns out to be exactly the same, after the Green, after they go away and "re-find" themselves, it's by choice rather than default.  It's dangerous, especially for the unprepared, but necessary.<br><br>My own passage occurred too young.  I barely survived and parts of my soul are twisted so bad they'll never straighten out.  I wasn't sure if Care was ready or not.  Her departure was much too sudden and emotional for my liking.  I figured if she was ready and I caught up, she'd smile and send me home.  If she wasn't, well, at least I know the pain of growing up too fast.  I had to try--for her and for myself.<br><br>I'm Karana's boy and fey to boot.  Carezzia was neither and I was out of my league.  The passage through the Green physically would mirror the spiritual nature of the traveler and Care was nothing like me.  Even as the Ancient of Days, I was going to need help with this one.<br><br>[While the Ancient is distracted with family matters, the Princess Joleena  manages to 'direct' Carezzia to her where the fairy pursues her own agenda]<br><br>The fairy favored Carezzia with a matronly frown.  "Let us set your mind to ease.  You are here for a reason and we do have a use for you but only if you are willing.  We do have your best interests at heart, so long as they do not conflict with our's, and we are more than willing to assist you with your own travails so long as the cost to us is not great.  First, let us begin with you."<br><br>The fairy cocked her head to one side and gazed at Carezzia like a bird before continuing.  "Understand, there are only two true things:  origins and definitions.  The what of a thing and from whence it came.  It is our surmise, Lady Carezzia, that you are unclear on both of these things, regarding yourself.  So tell me, young one, who are you truly and where do you come from?  Perhaps then you may tell us what we may do for you."<br><br>Carezzia sat in uncomfortable silence, pinned under the fairy's gaze, her tea cooling forgotten before her. <br><br>/snip/<br><br>"You must forgive our amusement," the fairy told Carezzia, smiling.  "It is simply that, as you bemoan the extreme preservation of your innocence, we are reminded of another who stood before us long ago lamenting the lose of his childhood.  Still, we are appreciative of your plight.<br><br>"We would first remind you that there are two true things.  Origin alone does not dictate destiny.  Remember, no matter where you have come from, how you chose to define yourself in the present and the future is your choice.  Indeed, young one, you should be prepared should you never learn the full truth of your childhood.  If that possibility is too threatening to you, perhaps you are not ready to learn.<br><br>"And, as you go, ask questions of yourself.  Wonder at that which does not fit within the context of what you know.  Why, if your mentor was a bard, did he raise both you and his daughter as druids?  Why would a bard live in the fastness of the wilderness, a wilderness, we might add, which is regularly visited by the Ancient, whose hatred of bards is well known?  Why would your relatives give you to him to raise?  So many questions you must ask."<br><br>Carezzia leapt verbally into the fairy's pause.  "He had a daughter?"<br><br>"Indeed, a lovely thing, much like yourself.  We fear there is little gain in that avenue of investigation.  She married young and moved away, dead now many years.  Still, it is not the finding of truths which concerns us.  We are most certain that, in time, you will have your answers.  Our concern is what you will do with these knowledges when you have them.<br><br>"For that, we would normally advise that you seek council from an elder of your own peoples.  Our inquiries have discovered, however, that your people have no Ancient.  More accurately, your Ancient is none other that the Ancient of the Fey Court itself.  We commend you, therefore, to consult with the High Priest of the Court itself."<br><br>The young druid was confused.  Perhaps she had lost her train of though in the fairy's persistent use of the imperial 'we' or perhaps she was expected to reach a conclusion on her own, Carezzia did not know.  Instead she asked directly.  "Forgive me, your grace, but, who is this Ancient?"<br><br>The fairy laughed aloud.  "The Ancient of Days.  It has been so long that we had forgotten that he has another name.  In truth, Ancient of Days began as little more than a nickname and became his title."<br><br>"What does it mean?"<br><br>The fairy waved a  dismissive hand at the question.  "His story to tell, if he chooses.  To answer your question, dear, the Ancient of Days is your Descourge.  When you are ready, we advise that you seek him out.  He is a great solace in times of uncertainty and made wise by his own pain."<br><br>Carezzia hesitated before replying.  "I'm not sure that he will speak with me.  Descourge's relationship with the guild has been…strained."<br><br>"Oh, child, we wish that you understood.  Of course he will speak with you.  It is for you and the others like you that he exists.  The guild has been an instrument of rendering him great pain and his current sojourn comes at high personal cost.  Is it so unreasonable that he be demanding and difficult?  But we assure you, his devotion is unquestioned for all the brusqueness he affects."  The fairy hesitated, lost in her own thoughts for a moment.  "My son is like the thistle--all the thorns and briar to protect the too-soft heart.  He is Karana's son with Tunare's heart.<br><br>"But," the fey noble continued, "We think that you are afraid of him."<br><br>Carezzia nodded slightly and did not speak.<br><br>"In that, you may be justified for he is mercurial and given to horrid moods.  Take this."  The fairy placed a pebble in the druid's hand closing the girls fingers around it, forcing her to hold it.  The stone was smooth as though from a creek and it had the mottled brown coloration of the same.<br><br>"Thank you, your grace, but what is it?"<br><br>"A memory.  A moment plucked from the rivers of time and held apart."  The gentle feys smile became suddenly malicious.  "In case he has forgotten himself.  Beyond this, there is little we can offer at this time.  Seek the past.  Hold yourself apart from it until you know yourself.  And seek the Ancient.  Our obligations to your mentor are paid."<br><br>"You mentioned earlier that you had a service for me to perform?"<br><br>Again, the smile was faintly menacing.  "You will be contacted if we have need.  Good journeys, Lady Carezzia."<br><br>[As he begins to narrow the search for the endangered younger druid, the Ancient is suddenly struck with the urge to explain theology to Carezzia's pet cat]-- "The problem, as I see it, is that no one understands their own gods and their place in the pantheon."  The cat opened a sleepy eye then closed it again in a slow wink as the druid continued his lecture, apparent undaunted by the fact that his sole listener was asleep.  "All the deities within the pantheon exist either as paragons in opposition or in compliment.  It gets even more complex when you consider that frequently the oppositions are to a compliment or the reverse.  Karana and Tunare are in compliment to one another, the giver of prey and life and the lord of the storms, master of hunts and bringer of death.  But both of these, this complimentary pair, only oppose each other in function, not in ideology.  They are facets of a singular paragon.  Their singular paragon is opposed in ideology by Innoruuk and Cazic, hate and fear, another complimentary paragon.  Even in this, the paragon of Karana-Tunare in compliment with Innoruuk-Cazic is opposed by the paragon of agnosticism and, on a different facet, Veeshan.  Rallos compliments Karana but not Tunare just as Prexus compliments Tunare but not Karana.  The entire system is a huge web of balance by symbolism and extremes.<br><br>"Look at it this way, which is truly the god of the elves, Innoruuk or Tunare?  It's a trick question, they both are.  No matter which race of elf you consider, their believes are defined just as much by the god of opposition as by the god of technical worship.  Let's take wood elves.  They worship Tunare but are defined in opposition by Innoruuk.  But, Tunare is in compliment to both Karana and Prexus just as Innoruuk is in compliment to Cazic and Rallos and they all are defined further by the greater oppositions.  You see?  Each deity  is understood only when one understands its place in the scheme of the greater pantheon.  It's like attempting to define day without discussing, not only night, but the entire concept of darkness, dawning, twilight, and so on.  Which, of course, leads me to Kaolinn.<br><br>"Our dear paladin brother is obsessive in his service to Mithaniel.  On the surface, that would seem to be a good thing but let me tell you, cat, it will end in madness and death if not mitigated by a greater understanding.  For the heavens sake, how much clearer does it need to be, eh?  The Marrs are twins.  I've seen maps with more complex symbolism.  Mithaniel is paragonic for valor but what does that really mean?  Valor is courage and fearlessness in battle.  Now, taken on its own, how different is that from Rallos?  None, until you examine the compliment and opposition.  Mithaniel is in opposition to Cazic while Rallos isn't.  This tells us that Mithaniel is dedicated to overcoming fear whereas Rallos uses fear as a portion of his armory.  The implication is that the fearlessness embodied by Rallos is an external action, an imposition of one man over another, while Mithaniel's fearlessness is directed internally, the overcoming of one's own personal failings and weaknesses.  It starts as a semantic discussion but, when reasoned out, the difference is of considerable significance.  <br><br>"The twinning of Marr makes the distinction of the kind of valor Mithaniel stands for both easier to divine and, at the same time, that much more significant.  Mithaniel's twin is Erollisi, paragonic of love and, just in case we were a little slow on picking up on the significance, female, just as Tunare is in complement to Karana.  I think that the incestuous overtones are significant here as well, not only are they in compliment within the pantheon--they are bother and sister, inseparable portions of a family unit and twins, implying a singular origin with dual resultant focus--they are also in reliant harmony on each other.  Placed in an incestuous context, they are a mated pair, never to be considered separately except as they are actors upon different stages.  And, since the pantheon is paragonic in its basis, the implied social taboo against incest is not applicable since the end goal is to provide a larger context of religious significance.  Since the belief system is derived from emulation of divine behaviors, the negative aspects are a non-issue."<br><br>The druid paused as one of the elfin guardsmen from nearby Kelethin approached.<br><br>"Are you Descourge Darkdestiny?" the guardsman asked timidly.<br><br>"Yes, this one is.  Now, be a good lad and hold on a minute.  My point here, cat, is that Mithaniel does not, actually, stand for valor exclusively.  He represents valor within the context of his sister, Erollisi--valor in the context of love.<br><br>"Now, to understand that, I have to explain love.  Love is not an emotion, that's lust or infatuation.  Love is an act of conscious will, a choice of a system of actions, the decision to act in a loving manner, if you will.  As such, love is objective, not subjective.  It can exist in a detached rational sense even when the subjective emotions underlying the previous choice may falter.  So, combine valor, fearlessness, with love, the conscious committed decision to act in a certain manner and we arrive at a true understanding of the fearlessness which Mithaniel stands for.  More to the point, it is not a fearlessness, but, as we discussed earlier, it is the overcoming of specific internal fears.  Mithaniel, understood in the context of his twin, represents the internal struggle to overcome our baser emotions and to chose to act with love towards all, even the enemy.  This is the fear which must be overcome.  Not a fear of the enemy, but a fear of the vulnerability within ourselves which is required to act with love towards our enemies, especially when these actions must then be violent and brutal.  We may still be forced to slay the enemy but, having come to regard all living things with love, it takes a terrible strength to still do what must be done.  That is the cowardice to be fought.  That, my feline friend, that is truly valor!<br><br>[After a trail of detective work leads him to Carezzia's captors, the Ancient understands his role to play within the oncoming drama and prepares]-- The druid sighed again.  "I'm exhausted, long day."  He reached into the casket and withdrew a glove-shaped tangle of rusted metal and tattered leather.  Scraps of mummified skin and broken links of chain gave the entire gauntlet a look more suited to a battlefield grave than actual use.  Darkdestiny pulled the traces tight around his forearm and Descourge flexed his hand.  The glove bent stiffly with the creak of hide and rasp of metal on metal.<br><br>The druid closed his hand into a fist then snapped his wrist sharply downward.  Twin spines of iron shot forward from the gauntlets backing, each ending in a short length of fine chain and barbed flesh-hooks.  He relaxed his fist and the spines slid smoothly back into hiding.  Frowning in concentration, he tensed the line of muscle just below his thumb, the dew claw, long atrophied in the "civilized" races.  In response, a spur of metal extended behind the thumb, parallel to his wrist.<br><br>"Looks good," he breathed in a voice heavy with resignation.<br><br>"For a martyr,"  Dark observed, "Opalla had a mean sense of design."<br><br>"He wasn't a martyr until after he died.  Before that, he was just one more poor sod trying to do what was right.  It's almost dawn.  I have to put down roots for a while and rest or I'll be worthless."<br><br>Dark nodded.  "I'll be around."<br>
