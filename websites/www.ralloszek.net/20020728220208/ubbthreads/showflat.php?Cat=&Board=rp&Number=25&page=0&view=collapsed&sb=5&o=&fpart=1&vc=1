Tiny tendrils of smoke wafted from the edges of the lush green leaf as it began to heat, followed by a darkening that crept upward to engulf it.  Almost completely shriveled by the time actual flame could be seen lapping at the remains, it broke from the stem that attached it to the tree, the flame dousing in the air by the time the wrinkled black leaf fluttered to the ground.<br><br>Carezzia peered down from her perch high in the tree with a satisfied smile etched upon face, though it felt foreign to smile with all the frowning she had been doing.  When she began her efforts only a few days ago, her first attempt had almost burned a whole tree to cinders and it was probably still smoking, even now.<br><br>Control and patience had been denied her upon birth, and at her level of training, she greatly needed it now more than ever.  Today, however, she began to truly believe effort would make up for that which genetics had robbed her.   Over the last few days, she proved concentration could make up for a world of defects.<br><br>Of course, had practicing concentration been her own suggestion, she would have tried it earlier, and mayhap accepted the idea more readily.  As it was, she only persevered with it as a last resort. <br><br>Deciding she deserved a break, she leaned her back against the trunk of the tree, the thick branch holding her lithe weight barely swaying with her movement.  It was an overly warm afternoon, and the flask she opened brought the relief of cool, thirst-quenching water.  'Twas a good day to be a wood elf in the top of a tree.<br><br>Over the past few days, warmth in the Commonlands had brought quite a few visitors beneath the inviting shade of her tree.  It was just over a small hill from a well-traveled path and there were many who stopped to do just she was now; resting and partaking of water.  She would stay hidden in the top of the tree, forcibly making herself resist the urge to play jests upon those below.  She sternly reminded herself she was studying, and it would not be a good idea to start anything that would either interrupt her or get her into trouble.<br><br>She had heard quite a few conversations, from the idle chatting of gossiping women, to talk of battles between men, to the overly amorous affections of an ogre and ogress.  From the heated words she heard, she gathered the ogre couple were recently married and traveling to a new city.  They were very obviously infatuated with one another.  Though Carezzia most certainly had a curious nature, that was something even she didn't want to witness and with a few discreet droppings of broken leafy branches, she aggravated them enough to make them seek a more appropriate spot for what they had in mind.<br><br>This time, her jubilant mood and the elation of her success gave her permission to eavesdrop as she heard sounds below her.  She would spend a little time listening, then mayhap intertwine a jest that fit with the conversation.  Nice secrets could be learned and used if one listened closely enough, such as a fear of snakes, spiders or rats. <br><br>"Me'z hungree, Ladee." The coarseness of a troll's demanding voice drifted up to Carezzia and she froze, the flask lifted to her lips for another drink.  Mayhap it wasn't such a good day to be a wood elf in a tree after all, not with a troll beneath her, and a hungry one at that.<br><br>"Shut UP, you fool.  I am tired of your complaining!"  That voice was sharp and feminine, the voice of a shrew, but obviously not one of a gutteral and hard to understand troll.  Carezzia didn't dare move much, but she turned her head to peek down through the leaves, catching a swatch of deep blue skin and a shock of white hair, and knew the female was Teir'Dal.  Carezzia hoped the 'Ladee' packed food for the troll, so he would not begin hunting for it.  <br><br>She knew many times trolls served as escorts and protectors for highborn Teir'Dal, so she was not surprised to see the combination of troll and dark elf together.  Normally, the troll deferred to the Teir'Dal, so she WAS surprised at this one's brazen aggravation with the Lady.<br><br>"You idiot!" the Lady shouted.  "We have only a short time to finish this job and you WILL NOT ruin this for me.  I haven't located the guild house of the Covenant of the Wolf, and that may yet take a few days!  Your fat stomach is something for which I DO NOT have time to worry!"<br><br>The troll was stubbornly holding out for his stomach.  "Yuz meen tu me! Me no barsh gud if mez hungree!! Me say NO when yuz askz me fer help!!!"" He unsheathed a huge sword from its scabbard, swung it in the air and stabbed it into the ground in defiance.<br><br>The Teir'Dal took a threatening step toward him, her fist raised.  "Feed, worm," she hissed, "but if you botch this for me, you will die a slow, painful death, at my hand.  Remember that!!"  She didn't look away from him as she raised her other hand, an eruption of red shooting out from her palm to drag in a struggling young kodiak that had been creeping by in the distance.<br><br>The troll was upon it in a flash, with an agility surprising for one so large.  Her nose wrinkling in disgust, the Teir'Dal turned away, but not before she saw blood spurting over his face and torso from the first limb he tore from the screaming animal.  Snorts and growls, mixed with sounds of the large animal's prolonged death, tearing flesh, and loud gulping swallows filled the air as he fed hungrily.  She wanted to press her hands to her ears, but she would not let him know it bothered her, though it was the lack of manners in his feeding that bothered her, and not the form of the feeding itself.<br><br>Her lips thinned, pressed tightly together as she walked to the edge of the shade the tree granted.  She was intent on one thing, and one thing only; her mission.  Waiting impatiently, pacing until he finished feeding, she swung back to him when she heard him rise clumsily from the ground, her mood not improved.<br><br>Her eyes ran over him in disgust, noticing the blood and bits of flesh on his face and chestplate.  "You WILL be bathing at the next river we cross.  I will not travel with a pig such as you are now."<br><br>He grunted in a satisfied way, wiping his big warty hand over his mouth before giving her a nod.  Grasping his sword hilt, he yanked it from the ground and sheathed it.  Now that his stomach was not rumbling, he waited patiently for her.<br><br>She had not eaten, nor quenched her thirst, but the Teir'Dal did not seem to notice.  Speaking more to herself than to him, she said, "A few days to find the guild house, then a few days to find Baltiscan himself, if he is away.  With luck, he will be there awaiting."  Sounding as though she was choking, she repeated his name.  "Baltiscan.  He will be dead before he sees me.  I am the finest Assassin in all of Neriak."<br><br>She turned her head, her chin lifted haughtily as she smoothed her black robe.  "Come, oaf," she spat before she headed in the direction of the path.<br><br>Carezzia stayed silent for long moments after she heard the troll lumber away.  Her pointed ears had perked up when she had first heard the guild house of the Covenant of the Wolf mentioned, knowing well herself where it was located.  In fact, she made <a href=http://carezzia.homestead.com/files/COW.htm>a little visit</a> not long ago, though she had been angry that day and did a some damage.  She had paid for it, in an odd way, but still felt as though she would be welcome if she showed up there unexpectedly.<br><br>When she heard the target's name, a jolt had hit her with such force she almost fell from the tree.  Baltiscan.  Who would hire an assassin to kill him?  Someone had to have paid well to employ the services of a caster as an assassin, who normally felt they were above jobs that were best left to the stealth of rogues.  Money and purpose; whoever it was had not been willing to chance a failure, making sure to add strong magic to the mix.<br><br>Even knowing she would reach the guild house of The Covenant of the Wolf well before the assassin, panic still gripped her; she must warn him as quickly as possible.  After scrambling down the tree, she pressed her hand to her stomach to stifle the bout of sudden illness she felt when she caught a glimpse of cast away bloody kodiak parts and was overwhelmed by the smell of fresh blood.  But only for a moment; the next instant, she lifted her hands, casting as quickly as a portal could be opened, and stepped through it.  Nothing was left of her, not even her scent, when the portal closed.<br>

<font class="post">
Baltiscan had been nervously pacing the floor of his study for well over an hour now, his steel shod boots echoing in the large room at his guild house.<br><br>He had awakened early this morn, before the beams of sunlight kissed the mountaintops, and had finished his guild duties early so he could practice with his mace near the clear blue lake.  After three long hours of sparring, his muscles ached, and sweat streamed over his ebon blue forehead, soaking his long ashen hair, but he still felt apprehensive.  The exertions of his hard workout did not wash away his tension, and when he returned to his study to ponder his situation, he didn't even bother to remove his silvery armor.  Too distracted, he didn't seem to notice his heavy boots scarring a trail across the wooden floor.<br><br>Only the sound of his pacing, metal against wood, reverberated through the room to keep him company.  He was tired; there was no denying that, as evidenced by the dark discolorations under his eyes.  But he was wide-awake, his mind unable to rest, and running through his head were the events that had transpired in the past few weeks.<br><br>His thoughts drift back to Lady Carezzia, who was a central part of those events.  When he had least expected it, when he was ready to take another sabbatical, he had found her.  They first met in the Crystal Caverns, where they had banded together to slay Queen Dracnia.  He had remarked to himself on how different she was from the coldly beautiful Teir'Dal that his parents betrothed him to; Carezzia was full of life and energy, always there to lift one's spirits. And as he grew to know her, he found out there was more to the flighty, carefree druidess than what he first thought. She gave him a reason to stay, to seek new challenges, and most importantly, to love.  She was also the reason he made a recent journey back to his home in Neriak.<br><br>Baltiscan had wished to confront his father about his new life, but most especially about her.  Sure, she was a wood elf, and she even worshipped Tunare, but they both had one thing in common -- honor.  He had been taught that honor was above all else, so how could he hate someone who conducted herself with grace and respect, no matter what race she happened to be?<br><br>Baltiscan tried to explain that he still worshipped Innoruuk; the Father was the only God to which he would ever bow down to, but he would revere Hate in his own way.  It seemed to Baltiscan that the Father had not forsaken him yet; he had retained his Shadow Knight abilities.  He still went into every battle with his skill and knowledge in one hand, and Hate in the other.  There were very few times either had failed him.<br><br>His earthly father would hear none of that. He was an old soldier who came from the old ways of learning, which was to follow the Priests of Innoruuk or be damned.  With his mother cowering in the background, they screamed at each other for hours, both men too stubborn to budge even a single inch.  In a fit of fiery rage, Baltiscan's father had flung open the doors to their manor, screaming wildly for the guards to arrest his own treacherous son.<br><br>Dodging the Indigo Brotherhood, Baltiscan had to flee, hiding in the dark alleyways of Neriak until someone could extract him.  He managed to elude the guards and escape the city, thanks in large part to Lady Carezzia, whose insistence had forced his friend Deith to guide her into the heart of Neriak to find him.  In the beginning, she had been petrified at seeing the pure depravity of the city of which she had only heard stories.  But, she had the strength and resolve to continue, willing herself to find him at all costs. The loud din of the search had informed her that he was in the Third Gate and she made her way there, tracking him atop the walled parapets surrounding the inner city, his battered body bruised and bloodied from fights with his own kin.  The loud cry of the guards signaled they were nearing the two of them, and with him clinging weakly to her, Carezzia had whisked them away to safety in the winds of a portal.<br><br>Though his death would have been horrible had he been captured, hers would have been the stuff of which legends are made.  At the least, she could have expected a slow torturous ending at the hands of the Priests, and Baltiscan did not even wish to contemplate the alternatives.  He loved her because she was willing to risk all that for him, though her bravery in rescuing him was not the only reason she held his heart.<br><br>Lady Carezzia was not there to comfort him at the moment; she was out in the Commonlands training, and he did not expect her for another few hours. Thoughts of her absence snapped Baltiscan's attention back to his troubles. He was sure his name would be stricken from the Tome of Innoruuk; no knight was allowed to pollute the purity of the Teir'Dal line by marrying an inferior race.  Just as surely, he would not be allowed to return to Neriak; the Indigo Brotherhood would see to that.  He would miss his old home and his life-long comrades from his knightly order, but most of all, he would miss his mother.<br><br>Though he expected some type of angry reception from his father, he had hoped to at least be given leave to say his good byes to his mother.  She was a waif of a woman, her frail body seemingly unable to have the strength to hold her steady, but she was the glue that held their family together. She was the one who was always there to deflect his father's fiery anger. His father was stern and his punishments were even sterner, but his mother was always there to comfort him.  Though his father wished for Baltiscan to follow in his footsteps to become an officer in the dark armies, it was his mother who showed him the little tricks of necromancers, sparking his interest in the combination of magic and the sword that the knighthood offered.  She doted on him and Baltiscan adored her.<br><br>"I have lost my titles and my family," he mused aloud.  "I am a knight without a liege and a son without a family.  Mayhap there is something I can do to change at least a small portion of that."  Now, his mind firmly resolved on his actions, he began undoing the straps that held his dragon-etched armor onto his body, the large protective breastplate clanging on the wooden floors as it drops.  After wiping the sweat of exercise off and changing into more comfortable leather leggings and a silken tunic, he strides to his large mahogany desk, plopping himself down on his chair and plucking a piece of parchment and a plumed quill to begin writing.  He needed a few supplies, and he found a list was always useful.<br><br>Innoruuk and his father be damned.  He would plan a way to return to Neriak to speak to his mother one last time.

Always, it startled Carezzia the first few minutes.  Being in wolf form was an overwhelming assault on every sense and nerve inside her and, even with time being so precious, the morphing process made her tremble, forcing those moments of adjustment.<br><br>Scents, everywhere, and sounds came from miles away, each one clearly distinctive of one another; vibrations of Norrath's movements in the ground beneath her paws; large steps from far away in contrast with smaller movements nearby.<br><br>And the wind.<br><br>The wind was beautiful.  She could feel it ruffle through her fur, and unlike in wood elf form, she could hear the flow of it in her ears. It was filled with colors unseen, and when she breathed it in, the strength of the many scents became magnified to such a degree, she could almost taste them upon her tongue.<br><br>Processing the multitude of incoming sensations became easier over the years, but she would never totally lose the awe she felt in those first few moments.  For that, she was grateful.<br><br>Stumbling her first steps as she tried to hurry herself, she raced from the druid portal, the wind stronger and more powerful with her speed.  Without color, yet so much more clear, the landscape was familiar enough now that she almost didn't need sight to guide the way.<br><br><br>************************************<br><br><br>The large double doors flew open, the shiny brass knobs bouncing against the walls they hit, and Baltsican ruined a whole section of the parchment he was writing upon.  Besides the line that ran across half of it from the jerk of his hand, the inkwell also startled, flowing quickly over most of what had already been written.<br><br>His first impulse was to shout and frown as he grabbed a linen left over from lunch, daubing at the ink.  He was grateful for the large blotting pad that covered the dark mahogany wood of his desk and was congratulating himself on a save well done when it registered who had brought the chaos and the state she was in.<br><br>He leaped from behind his desk, tossing the linen into a small basket and took her small hands in his own.  "Lady Carezzia, are you alright?"  After a quick perusal, he found her to be seemingly in one piece without injury and he wrapped his arms around her to hold her close to him.  "You startled me; I thought you were hurt.  Mayhap you should take a moment to catch your breath."<br><br>She did need to catch her breath, but it didn't take long.  "I have news, m'Lord, and methinks it must have something to do with your recent trip to Neriak."<br><br>"Nay!  I do not wish to hear it then!"  He guided her to a chair and gently pressed her back against it to sit when she began to protest.  "I am tired of it all!  Let us talk of other things."<br> <br>"But, 'tis MOST important!!  I......."  She glared at him when his hand covered her mouth, her dark golden eyes flaming, and she momentarily considered giving it a little bite..  Now that she was here, in all her hurry, he didn't wish to listen.<br><br>She knew him well enough to know he was almost more stubborn than she was.  Almost.  Staying silent so he would remove his hand, she almost burst with holding it in as he made his way back to his desk, settling himself in the large chair behind it.<br><br>"Let us talk of pleasant things, shall we?  What have you been practicing?" <br><br>There was more than one way to skin a cat.  She just had to figure out how to do it as effectively as the time-honored practice of simply using a knife and getting it done.<br><br>"I have been practicing concentration, much as I hate to admit it."  She gave him a frown as he laughed, remembering well the heated disagreement they had about 'practicing' to concentrate.  She had argued that you either concentrated or you didn't, and he had let her know the great error of her ways.<br><br>"How much of the forest did you destroy?"  He laughed when she tartly answered there had only been one woodland casualty, but as he settled back into his chair, she again noticed the sadness etched on his features.  It had been there since Neriak, and she wondered if he would ever be eased of the painful sadness that seemed to settle within; so deeply, it could well travel with him for life. <br><br>Not long ago, Carezzia had made <a href=http://carezzia.homestead.com/files/ORB1_Long_Journey_Home.htm>her own journey home</a> .  Mayhap it must be done by everyone, at one time or another, for different reasons and with different ending results.  It is inevitable for most people to leave what once was, and sometimes only the return to it makes obvious the changes life has wrought.  The contrast of past and present tells a truth with brutal honesty, and without words to misconstrue.<br><br>Rising quietly, without even a rustle from the snug leather armor she wore, she rounded his desk and approached his chair.  He was ready for her, having pushed back from the desk, and she settled onto his lap and into his arms, resting her cheek against his shoulder.<br><br>"I have a problem that maybe you can help me with, since I seem to be unable to solve it," Carezzia said softly, only moving enough to lightly kiss the side of his neck.  The stroking of his fingertips against her cheek was soothing and she knew he was now in 'protector' mode.<br><br>"What is it m'love?  You know I shall help you with any problem you may have," he answered as he planted a tender kiss atop her head.<br><br>She began to skin her cat.  "I am in love with a Teir'Dal, m'Lord."  <br><br>He laughed at her woeful voice and replied with much exuberance, "But that is WONDERFUL, my dear.  If you fall in love, 'tis always best to find someone of a superior race, do you not think so???"<br><br>She lifted her head to glare at him, then caught herself and snuggled onto him again.  "I shall not get into that argument again, m'Lord, but 'tis not all of my problem.  You see, this one happens to be atrociously STUBBORN and ORC HEADED."<br><br>"Please do not put the orcs down, love.  They may be stupid, but they have their uses to us." He couldn't help laughing now that he knew what she was doing, but decided he wouldn't make it any easier for her to accomplish.<br><br>"Well.....he is, nonetheless.  He stops me from speaking when I have something to say, then wants to listen when I am silent.  Do you think he may have had some head injuries during some of his past battles?"<br><br>He smiled as he shifted, and she sat up on his lap to look at him, her forearms lightly draped over his shoulders.  "Mayhap he is tired of thinking of things that bring sadness," he said.  "Mayhap he thinks of you as being his happiness in life and does not wish to associate you with anything else."  The lift of his hands dislodged her arms, and both his palms cupped her face, his thumbs rubbing the smoothness of her cheeks.<br><br>"But, m'Lord, sadness cannot always be avoided.  To be included in life is to be included into the wealth of emotions that make it up, wanted or unwanted," she answered softly, the sudden intense glow of his emerald eyes stealing her breath.<br><br>"Aye, and methinks I was the one who said that once before.  I had just thought to avoid it for a little time."  It was a whisper with which he answered, an instant before his fingers slid into her hair to pull her closer.  <br><br>His lips were warm and inviting, the taste and scent of him making her forget completely of that skinning she was attempting, and she turned more on his lap to press herself closer.  The beating of his heart was strong, and she found that comforting even as it aroused her heart into answering rapid beats of its own.<br><br>It wasn't until she heard the loud echo of boots striding down the marble hallway that Carezzia realized she was plastered to him in a most unladylike way, her small fingers running through his hair as she returned his kisses hungrily.  With a small gasp against his mouth, she pulled back from him, unsuccessfully trying to smooth unruly curls with her hands.<br><br>The relief on her face when the footsteps continued on past the door must have been evident.  He threw his head back and roared with laughter.  "M'Lady, you forget yourself!!"<br><br>"Nay, you make me forget myself!!!" Shooting a small frown at him, even as she straightened her tunic and slid from his lap, she decided it was time to finish the poor, suffering cat.<br><br>"M'Lord, there is an Assassin on the way here to….to…..well, I to do what assassins normally do."<br><br>His sigh had the force of the wind.  "Has it not occurred to you to notice the multitude of guards with which the guild house has been inundated lately?  Had you not thought I would be expecting it?"<br><br>Carezzia blinked, chagrinned.  She had not noticed, but then, it was well known she had a one-track mind, and at the moment of entering the guild house, that had not been on her mind.  Poor cat.  It had already been skinned well before she had begun the torture of it herself.<br><br>"Oh."<br><br>"'Twas nice of you to give me warning, though.  I shall let the guards know of it."  He lowered his head, dipping a new quill into a freshly opened bottle of ink, the smooth strokes of his letters being written on a nice, clean, blank parchment.  "If you would allow me a moment to finish my list, you may then accompany me to the Captain of the Guard.  I am sure he would appreciate a description of our future intruders."<br><br>Carezzia moved quietly behind his chair, wincing as one of her curls fell onto his shoulder to give away the fact she was peeking at his list.  He shot her a rueful glance, but she had seen what she needed to see before he could hide it.<br><br>"A packing list!!!  Where do you travel, m'Lord?"  No longer trying to hide her nosiness, she looked at him, ready to argue before she knew exactly what the argument would be.<br><br>He was prepared for it, having seen the spark in those large, golden elfin eyes he adored.  "I am traveling to Neriak again, m'Lady, and I am in NO mood to tussle with you about it."<br><br>"Oh.  Actually, tussling sounds fun, does it not??"  Her eyes sparkled more as she smiled impishly, and his eyes lowered to gaze at the full, rosy lips he had tasted only a few moments earlier.  "'Tis fine to make a list and to go, as long as you know I shall not be left behind."<br><br>For the second time, she heard the depth of his despair in a long sigh.  Suddenly looking weary, he answered dejectedly, a sadness radiating from his eyes.  "Aye, m'Lady.  This trip you shall not be left behind." <br>

Much happened that day.  The preparations for the journey went smoothly,  though not done to Baltiscan's satisfaction until very late in the eve.  Deciding they needed a good night's rest, he ordered a guest chamber readied for Carezzia.<br><br>His own rooms were deep in the basements of the guild house, hidden from the sunlight, surrounded by the damp clay smell of his boyhood home in Neriak.  It suited him, and he rested well each night in his dragon bed.<br><br>Once, she had slept in the dragon bed, but she was not quite sure how she felt about that yet.  A slow blush crept over her skin as she remembered one eve, many days before, when she had burst into his study covered in dust, disheveled, with tears in her armor and tangles in her hair.  She had been on the losing end of several battles while hunting, and no end of frustration was oozing from her.<br><br>Far from being the usual stern commander who grilled her on details, he had put his administrative work away in the drawers of his large mahogany desk.  With his own hands, he had bathed her and washed her hair in his private bathing room, even combing the tangles from her wild, unruly curls with a gentleness that surprised her.<br><br>Stubborn about those Shadow Knight's vows, he stayed honorable when he removed his own clothing and joined her in the large dragon claw footed tub to clean her thoroughly.  Even when he tucked her into his bed, he held himself in reserve, lightly trailing kisses up the side of her neck to her waiting lips as he wrapped his strong arms around her.  That was all; one taste, and then he had held her tightly enough that brooked limited movement, until she finally fell asleep.<br><br>The room had been dimly lit, and it seemed to her to have a sinister aura about it.  Late into the night, she had awakened, still held tightly, and thought she had been dreaming.  <br><br>The dragons were moving.  <br><br>The thick mahogany wood was carved with a great detail, of long dragon bodies wrapped around and around the full height of  bedposts almost reaching the high ceiling.  As she watched, the carvings seem to raise slightly from the rest of the wood, and take on a reddish glow, slowly slithering around and around the posts, then over the headboard and footboard.  She gasped, only to feel Baltiscan's arms tighten around her to hold her still.  Certain it was a dream, she said nothing, and finally relaxed enough to sleep once more.<br><br>Upon the morn, she had questioned him of her dream, but only received a small smile with an unreadable expression in his eyes.  "Your imagination amazes me at times, Lady Carezzia," was all he ventured to say.   Then he had taken her attention away by suggesting mayhap she had been nervous and flustered being held so closely in a virile, handsome,  male elf's strong arms throughout the night.  Of course, that led to a completely different conversation, and she wondered now if that had not been purposely planned.<br><br>She thought of this as she watched herself in the mirror of the oaken vanity in the guest chambers.  The last stroke of the brush smoothed through her hair, and she laid it carefully aside, her small hands lifting to push the silky tresses, softened more from the brushing, away from her shoulders.  She was tired, and knew she would need much rest for the days to come.<br><br>Sleep came quickly, but in that, there is usually a catch.  Her dream came almost just as quickly; the one of old, though this time it had a new twist.<br><br>The dark sky crackled and hissed as lightning erupted from it, striking the ground with enough force to shake it for miles. The heavens were furious with Carezzia, cloaking itself with dark angry clouds, and sending the bolts to try to find her as she ran through a dark forest. Small bumps covered her skin, responding both to the heavy charge of electricity in the air and her anticipation of the next strike of fury that she knew would be sent in her direction. <br><br>She could feel the silky material of the royal blue sarong she was wearing; the one she always wore in this dream, though she had never possessed such an item. Wrapped tightly around her slender body and looped over one shoulder, it was only loosely done from mid thigh down to her knees, and for some reason she focused on the sensation of that part rustling against her skin in the wind. <br><br>The path she ran was unfamiliar to her, and she couldn't anticipate each bend and turn. The bolts were striking closer, though, and she knew that moving as the crow flies would benefit her more than through the twists and curves of which the path was leading.  As she left the path, a vine grabbed her bare foot, sending her flying to the ground.<br><br>Her hands clutched the thick grass as she pulled her foot, trying to free it from the vine. It hadn't registered with her that her foot was being held, and she thought it only stuck. Her view of things was made murky as the fury of the wind sent leaves and twigs flying through the air. To make it worse, her thick mass of hair kept blowing in her face, shutting out the sight, but not the sound, of the large tree exploding near her as it became victim to the next lightning bolt.<br><br>The bright light engulfed her, the roar almost deafening her, even though she pressed her palms tightly to her pointed elfin ears. She thought maybe she had lost proper hearing, because her ears became filled with the sounds of small whispers that she couldn't understand, and little laughs that seemed to make fun of her.<br><br>She look frantically back at her foot as she kicked to loosen it, and her heart stopped when she saw who held her fast.  His hand had a death grip around her small ankle, and his face was twisted in anger.  Galienne.  <br><br>Tears immediately came to her eyes to trail down her cheeks, and her whisper was snatched by the roaring wind.  "Please…..please forgive me….."<br><br>The sensation of the material tightening above her knees took her attention again, and she wondered why she would even feel it at a moment such as this. <br><br>And then she felt herself dropping, not far, and hitting with a thud to the floor.<br><br>Gingerly sitting up, she ran her fingers through her hair to push it back from her face. She was on the floor of the sleeping chamber with the sheets tangled around her thighs and, just as one does who awakens to reality, she knew immediately she had been dreaming.<br><br>Not that she didn't still feel the horror and sorrow from it. Her heart was racing as she crawled back onto the bed, and it took long moments for her to begin to breathe properly again. <br>She had had this dream many, many times, yet this was the first time in which Galienne had appeared.  Was it the guilt she felt for having caused <a href=http://carezzia.homestead.com/files/ORB2_Still_Searching.htm>his permanent death</a>, or was he himself showing his anger from where it was Mother Tunare may have him now?   There was not a day she did not think of him, nor would there ever be such a day for the rest of her life.<br><br>Her thoughts tormented her throughout the night, her tears not allowing her rest, and when the glow of the morning sun began to sneak through her window, she had not slept a moment.<br><br><br>

Much had happened to Carezzia since that bad dream.  Baltiscan had delayed his trip to Neriak, had a brief battle with the assassin, which thankfully had been successful on his part.  He also insisted they marry before his trip to Neriak, giving her only a week to prepare, and while he was at it, decided he did not want to risk her traveling with him to the dark lands.  She had tentatively promised to abide by that decision, but only in a roundabout way, to her thinking, so she did not consider it a binding promise.  However, he seemed satisfied with it.<br><br>Once decided, the guild house was a flurry of activity during the next week.  When Carezzia would arrive from her own guild house, she would sneak through the back of Baltiscan's study to get in, avoiding the entrance doors and anyone who might be there, only because every person she met would shove a goblet into her hand so he or she could make a toast of congratulations.<br><br>She came close to being congratulated to a wine induced coma.  After the first few days, she only pretended to drink, knowing she needed to keep her wits about her.  Baltscan found it humorous when he noticed her mildly tipsy one afternoon and commented, "'Twould be wise to hide when you see one of my guild's members, love, if you plan on actually accomplishing something.  None of them are likely to let a drinking opportunity like this away from them, especially Jeboda."  Baltiscan either had a very high tolerance, or else he hid it much better than she was able, because she didn't notice him turning down a single goblet.<br><br>Sneaking past the kitchen a few days before the ceremony, she ran into Searra and Ozymandius, both wearing aprons and having the look of sprinkled flour about them.  In the crook of one arm, Ozymandius was carrying a huge bowl filled with creamy batter, while mixing it with a large wooden spoon in his other hand.  Searra had a wooden spoon, too, but no bowl.  She was apparently trying to make a point and waving the spoon for extra emphasis, but judging from Ozymandius' face, the spoon was not having the desired effect.<br><br>After a quick, anxious glance to see if there were any bottles within reaching distance, and finding none, Carezzia relaxed and greeted them, followed by, "I did not know you could bake.  What are you making?"  <br><br>The batter looked extremely enticing and Ozymandius suddenly grinned.  "A cake.  Your cake.  Didn't Balti tell you?  I can already tell it is going to be VERY good."  <br><br>Searra gave Ozymandius a level look, and somehow Carezzia got the idea that Ozymandius had been doing quite a bit of taste testing.<br><br>"You both have done too much already!  Methinks you are working harder on things than I."  Carezzia gave them both a hug, Ozymandius' very carefully since he had his hands full.<br><br>A few days earlier, they had asked Carezzia to their home in Surefall Glade, and presented her with a beautiful wedding outfit they had obtained with the help of Lady Kealynn.  Baltiscan had mentioned, no doubt a tad bit amused, that Carezzia was in a tither about finding a full outfit to wear in a week's time.  She had quite a bit of mismatched armor and some very informal druidess dresses she liked to wear while walking barefoot in the forest, but nothing she felt suitable for her wedding.<br><br>They could not have known she was looking for something in forest green, yet the soft wicker outfit was exactly the shade for which she had been searching.  Baltiscan had mentioned to Carezzia many times that his favorite color for her to wear was the color of a leaf, and that he loved the scent of leaves and wildflowers she always seemed to carry with her.  It was perfect.<br><br>*************<br><br><br>"I do not have much time," Carezzia whispered into the wind.  The breeze, gentle one moment and more forceful the next, seemed frustrated as one who could not talk, but had much to say.<br><br>Though her eyes were closed, she could see.  No longer on the flat path that led into the forest, her mind carried her to the height of a large hill, the wind still rushing to speak.  Robes of the palest blue, foreign to her, fluttered with the forces of the breeze as she stood at the top of the hill, her bare feet uncovered by the movement of the hem.  It was as if someone else had entered into her imagination and taken her body elsewhere.<br><br>She turned; from what catalyst, she did not know.  A noise, a glimpse of movement?  It seemed natural to know what was there without warning, though, and she was unafraid of the dark cloud that moved toward her.<br><br>"I must find him," she murmured.  "Tell him I need him."<br><br>Thousands of whispers filled her ears, overlapping one another so as to make it impossible to discern the meanings.  Some were small voices, others deep, and the languages were varied, many, she suspected, murmurs of languages long dead.<br><br>After straining to hear, one voice seeped through, though it seemed to be the softest of them all, speaking in a language she did not know, but could understand.  <i>Nae.  He is not done.</i><br><br>"I need him."<br><br><i>He has much to do.</i>  The voice caressed all around her, as though touching her, sometimes heard louder behind, sometimes in front.<br><br>"I need him."<br><br>The voice softened more, yet it seemed to be even more easily heard to Carezzia's ears.  <i>The message will be passed; your impatience shall be blamed for the consequences it will bring.</i><br><br>*************<br><br>Carezzia had not seen Sir Descourg in almost a year.  It was not unusual, she had been told by Dark Destiny, for him to do so, and that she should not be worried when such events occurred.  Still, it was odd to her and she wondered how Lady Dark endured it for such long periods.<br><br>She spent her mornings at her guild house moving her things.  Now that she was being married, she had to compromise, unless she wished to live apart from her husband.  It wasn't only her things she took; she also repainted the room to its original color, removing any touch she had given it.  When she was done, the total essence of her presence was removed, as though she had never existed.<br><br>Now she returned, with company.  Walking back with the last of her items tucked in her bags, she was followed by a snorting little bear and a black panther, grown large and sleek.  Carezzia had not yet named the panther, always just calling her "Cat", although she kept mentioning needing to name it one day.  The bear belonged to Sir Descourg, and was in her safekeeping until his return, whenever that would be.<br><br>Her instincts told her something was not right with Sir Descourg and his situation.  She felt an unease when she tried to hear the voices, and when she asked questions they refused to answer.  Sometimes her palm burned hot at the spot his pebble shards had entered her skin.  <br><br>She needed him now, for her wedding, and did not let the voices intimidate her this time.  Although she had been adamant, she was still surprised it worked, and looked for him wherever she heard sound.  Not knowing where he was, how long it would take to get the message, nor how long it would take to get to her, she had no idea of when to expect him.<br><br>***********<br><br>She was delighted to find him waiting at the Covenant of the Wolf guild house when she finally reached it.  He looked worn, she noticed, and his eyes did not immediately meet hers, as though looking at her would tell her of things he did not wish her to know.<br><br>Dropping her things, she flew immediately into his arms as he gave her a fatherly kiss atop her head.  "Father Des, I knew you would come!!!"<br><br>"What is it that called for such haste, pet?" he asked when he looked down at her.  "The urgency of the message had me on edge.  I have worried leaving you alone, even with the pets and a home you can turn to for help. "<br><br>"'Tis not bad news, only good.  I am getting married, finally, and you must give me away!"  Her news made him relax, and it wasn't until he did so that she realized how tense he had been.  <br><br>He snorted.  "That may or may not be good news. Depends on who it is." He stepped back, and she noticed his dust covered bags.  "Is it Baltiscan, or have you pushed him aside for another beau I have not yet approved?"<br><br>Carezzia gasped as she bent to collect her bags.  "Shame on you!  Of course it is Baltiscan."<br><br>Heaving a sigh, he gathered his own bags, looking around for a direction to go.  "Aye, I thought so."<br><br>Seeing his look down the hallway, she moved ahead of him and he followed her silently to a guest room just off the main hallway.   "I have a few things to do, pet," he said, as he dumped his worn bags onto the red silk comforter covering the bed.  "I'll find you later."<br><br>"I shall be here the rest of the day, Father Des," she answered, a little indecisively, watching him a moment before she left the room.<br><br>It was not like him, she thought, to be so distracted and seem so worried, especially when he would catch her eye.  To her, Sir Descourg had always been self assured, knew his way around places and people she would have been afraid to be in or know, and was never one for silence when he had the opportunity to speak.<br><br>She puzzled over the oddity as she hurried back to her own room.<br><br>********************<br><br>A wedding is a day of celebrating the union of two who want to become one; the beginning of a new life together and as such is given the same reverence by most races and classes of beings.<br><br>Weddings also could drive an otherwise normal elf insane.  Or so Carezzia found out on the day of her wedding.<br><br>It was beautiful, but in retrospect, it all seemed a blur, with a mix of friends from various guilds, her beloved fiancée, Father Des, and all three of their guilds.  Lady Raveena conducted the ceremony, and Lady Kaldarye added a blessing of Hate that Carezzia was still mulling over.<br><br>As after most weddings, the bride did not feel she spent enough time with each guest, or thanked them well enough for the wonderful gifts they gave before becoming distracted with the next event coming along.  The comfort she took, though, was in being assured by every married female within hearing distance that they had felt the same at their weddings, also. <br><br>It DID have added interest, though, a little beyond the norm.   Shortly after arriving at the Island in Lake Rathe, the spot Baltiscan had proposed to her, they were set upon by murderers, causing the wedding to be moved to the Arena.  Carezzia was upset at being married in an Arena of battle at first, but then finally conceded it was probably the safest place in which to be defended.<br><br>Besides being married in an arena, a wedding guest was attacked by other guests.  It was Greon of No Tears Initiates, and he had the audacity to call her a witch during her own wedding and to protest to the union.  Mayhap because of those reasons, the attack did not bother her so terribly bad, but the ensuing threat of a guild war when Lady Kaldarye married herself to Greon did.  It happened shortly after Baltiscan and Carezzia wed, in the ensuing celebratory chaos that followed the ceremony.  Because of the chaos, Carezzia did not know the details, but only knew Lady Kaldarye began sporting Greon's family name and <a href=http://boards.gamers.com/messages/message_view-topic.asp?name=cotw_roleplay&amp;id=zzzwm>proclaiming herself as his wife.</a> <br><br><br>Now, as she sat thinking of all this in hindsight, she could not help the feeling that Sir Des was not himself.  What forging had he needed so long ago when she was rescued from her temporary slavery in Neriak? He had not returned with her, and the first of her mysterious voices had come to her at that time, telling her that Sir Des would not be leaving Neriak with her.<br><br>Had this been what affected him?<br><br><i>Ye shoulda looked. </i>It was soft, almost only a thought except that Carezzia could hear the words of a voice that did not belong to her.  She should have been used to them, but knew she never totally would be.  <i>Ye shouldna let yer fear rule ye.  Ye shoulda looked inta tha water . </i><br><br>"The water," she whispered, remembering.  Lady Jolene, the Queen of the Faeries, had told her to look into the waters when she was ready, but she had not been ready.  That day, she had absorbed too much and needed to think on what she had learned first; that her sister had been the mother of someone she knew in her old guild, The Order of the Righteous Blade.  So close, he had been, but now he was gone, and so was anything she may ever have known of her dead sister, save a little picture Sir Kaolinn had given her once.  She only had that because she wished to learn more of Quidluanne and knew Sir Kaolinn's mother had once known him.<br><br>It seemed long ago, and so much had happened between then and now.  The day she could not look into the magic pool was the day she learned more of her father and mother, and at least partially what had happened to them.  It was too much, and she could not go further; she had been too much of a coward to know more.<br><br>She had not told the faerie queen she could still hear the voices after those first few days.  She heard them frequently, but they came to her when she least expected it, during thoughts in which she would lose herself and usually always from thoughts of the past.  But, what of the future?  Would they still come to her when the secrets of the past were unraveled, or would they disappear forever?  The whispers had become a part of her and she did not want to lose them.  <br><br>Would gazing into the pool completely end the queries of what had been, leaving only what was to come? It seemed as if she was being told, again, which direction to go.<br>

Yes, I remember that, BUT THAT sir, was NOT the wedding.  <br><br>The wedding was beautiful and the only person that got killed at the wedding was Greon (but he was warned).  <br><br>What YOU are refering to was before the wedding started.  We were getting the wedding party together and such. <br><br>But if for some ODD reason it makes you FEEL better to believe you disrupted the wedding.. then ok.  Everyone's memories of an event are always for thier own pleasures anyway.. so twist it however you may want to.
