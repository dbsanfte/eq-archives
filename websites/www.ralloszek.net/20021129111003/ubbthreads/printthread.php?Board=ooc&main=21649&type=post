Hello Lolyen, and thank you for your interest in our Rallos Zek Server.  Let me first introduce myself, I am Settle, I am what you would call the chairman of this PvP server.  I'm involved in almost every aspect of Rallos Zek.  That's enough about me, let's get to answering some of your questions/concerns.  #1 Rallos Zek is an one-item and all coin loot server, however the exceptions are that no-drop items and items located in your Primary, Secondary, Range, and Ammo Weapon slots cannot be looted.  The fact that my server is item loot does lower the number of "twink pk's" down as compared to Sullon, however there are still many out there.  #2 Well first off... yes, there is an occasional exp killing episode (if it's intentional then /petition), but this exp killing usually involves people of higher levels.  From what I've seen not to many people go out of there way to exp kill in the pre-50 levels, but I'm sure it does happen once in awhile.  #3 Well you crazy guy, this isn't really a question as much as it is a comment but yes, you are correct about RZ being 4 up and 4 down.  #4  PK classes... SK's and Wizards... I kid I kid.  There are PK's in every class, however the more popular classes are Wizards and SK's (especially at lower levels), Druids and Necros (*personal note* and there are mages that whored their epic's from Anti-guilds then turned PK).  <br /><br />Well I hope I helped to answer some of your questions and I hope you choose to join us in the Rallos Zek community. <br /><br />Thank You,<br />-Chairman Settle
