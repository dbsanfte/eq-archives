Im not an American, but I think one of your Senators made a great speech (Senator Byrd) when he said last month..<br /><br />*Start of quote*<br /><br />"I believe in this beautiful country.  I have studied its roots and gloried in the wisdom of its magnificent Constitution.  I have marveled at the wisdom of its founders and framers.  Generation after generation of Americans has understood the lofty ideals that underlie our great Republic.  I have been inspired by the story of their sacrifice and their strength.  <br /><br />But, today I weep for my country.  I have watched the events of recent months with a heavy, heavy heart.  No more is the image of America one of strong, yet benevolent peacekeeper.  The image of America has changed.  Around the globe, our friends mistrust us, our word is disputed, our intentions are questioned.  <br /><br />Instead of reasoning with those with whom we disagree, we demand obedience or threaten recrimination.  Instead of isolating Saddam Hussein, we seem to have isolated ourselves.  We proclaim a new doctrine of preemption which is understood by few and feared by many.  We say that the United States has the right to turn its firepower on any corner of the globe which might be suspect in the war on terrorism.  We assert that right without the sanction of any international body.  As a result, the world has become a much more dangerous place.<br /><br />We flaunt our superpower status with arrogance.  We treat UN Security Council members like ingrates who offend our princely dignity by lifting their heads from the carpet.  Valuable alliances are split.  After war has ended, the United States will have to rebuild much more than the country of Iraq.  We will have to rebuild America's image around the globe.<br /><br />The case this Administration tries to make to justify its fixation with war is tainted by charges of falsified documents and circumstantial evidence.  We cannot convince the world of the necessity of this war for one simple reason.  This is a war of choice.  <br /><br />There is no credible information to connect Saddam Hussein to 9/11.  The twin towers fell because a world-wide terrorist group, Al Qaeda, with cells in over 60 nations, struck at our wealth and our influence by turning our own planes into missiles, one of which would likely have slammed into the dome of this beautiful Capitol except for the brave sacrifice of the passengers on board.<br /><br />The brutality seen on September 11th and in other terrorist attacks we have witnessed around the globe are the violent and desperate efforts by extremists to stop the daily encroachment of western values upon their cultures.  That is what we fight.  It is a force not confined to borders.  It is a shadowy entity with many faces, many names, and many addresses.<br /><br />But, this Administration has directed all of the anger, fear, and grief which emerged from the ashes of the twin towers and the twisted metal of the Pentagon towards a tangible villain, one we can see and hate and attack.  And villain he is.  But, he is the wrong villain.  And this is the wrong war.  If we attack Saddam Hussein, we will probably drive him from power.  But, the zeal of our friends to assist our global war on terrorism may have already taken flight.<br /><br />The general unease surrounding this war is not just due to "orange alert."  There is a pervasive sense of rush and risk and too many questions unanswered.   How long will we be in Iraq?  What will be the cost?  What is the ultimate mission?  How great is the danger at home?  A pall has fallen over the Senate Chamber.  We avoid our solemn duty to debate the one topic on the minds of all Americans, even while scores of thousands of our sons and daughters faithfully do their duty in Iraq.  <br /><br />What is happening to this country?  When did we become a nation which ignores and berates our friends?  When did we decide to risk undermining international order by adopting a radical and doctrinaire approach to using our awesome military might?  How can we abandon diplomatic efforts when the turmoil in the world cries out for diplomacy? <br /><br />Why can this President not seem to see that America's true power lies not in its will to intimidate, but in its ability to inspire?  <br /><br />War appears inevitable.  But, I continue to hope that the cloud will lift.  Perhaps Saddam will yet turn tail and run.  Perhaps reason will somehow still prevail.  I along with millions of Americans will pray for the safety of our troops, for the innocent civilians in Iraq, and for the security of our homeland.  May God continue to bless the United States of America in the troubled days ahead, and may we somehow recapture the vision which for the present eludes us."<br /><br />*End of quote*<br /><br />I also support the troops and hope that the job can be done with as little suffering and loss of life as possible. I don't extend that same support to the politicians. This war may very well have been inevitable, but to rush into it with only the flimsiest legal argument may have made the job so much harder for those troops that I support.<br /><br />Of course, if the war is illegal, my country could be held to account before the International Courts. The USA will not, because the USA has refused to sign up to any international agreements (including those on biological and chemical weapons). <br /><br />I also have to say that I support my country's troops most, though I also support all of the soldiers there. Thus far, however, we have lost more lives to American fire than we have to Iraqi. I do hope that those responsible for "blue on blue" incidents get held to account.<br /><br />I fear that this war is creating a whole new generation of terrorists. I think that would have not been the case if we had allowed more time for inspections and built international support. The whole world was in sympathy with the USA after 9/11... how quickly that has evaporated!<br /><br />I also fervently hope that the promises made to focus on a resolution to the Israel/Palestine issue were honestly made and were not simply "spin". The support of a country that was founded on terrorism and has been in breach of 68 UN resolutions for over 20 years must be seen by Middle Eastren countries as an anachronism.<br /><br />I could go on.. I won't.<br /><br />There have actually been some very good threads on the subject on the Ascending Dawn boards <br /><br /><a href="http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showMessageRange?topicID=1939.topic&amp;start=1&amp;stop=20" target="_blank">http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showMessageRange?topicID=1939.topic&amp;start=1&amp;stop=20</a> for anyone interested... Taranna argues very eloquently.<br /><br />Lastly, now that we are there, it is *vital* that we finish the job this time, and I support our armed forces 100% in their efforts to do so.<br /><br />Riatsila
