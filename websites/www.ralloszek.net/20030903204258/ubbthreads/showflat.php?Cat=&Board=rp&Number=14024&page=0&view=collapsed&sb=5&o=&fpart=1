(ooc--RL has been very busy and the plot arc for Bitter Ashes has proven to be a much more ambitious undertaking than I had at first expected.  Since it takes place before Carezzia's wedding, you can see that I'm quite behind.  Still, I think it is a good tale with a good deal of insight into the personalities involved and I think it bears telling.  I should be getting back to it soon and have posted, below, a breif of the major characters in the tale to make it easier to follow the continuity.)<br /><br />Persona Dramatis:<br /><br />The Clan Destined:<br />Descourge Darkdestiny--Patriarch, adopted son of Joleena, High Preist of the Fey Court<br />Darkdestiny Descourge--Erudian, unofficial Matriarch of the clan<br />Aluleeana--Eldest child of Descourge<br />Lulee--Youngest child of Descourge<br /><br />House Rileaus:<br />Lord (R'lean) Rileaus--Patriarch, deceased<br />Lord Rene Rileaus--Youngest and only surviving son of R'lean, ward of House T'Ere<br /><br />House T'Enel:<br />High Lord T'Ere T'Enel--Patriarch, youngest High Lord to ever ascend to the Council of Nobles<br />High Lady Even'gel T'Enel--Matriarch, wife of T'Ere<br />Lord Garet T'Enel--Only child of T'Ere and T'Enel, deceased<br />Lord T'Vern T'Enel--Seneschal of the house and childhood friend of T'Ere<br /><br />The Majilenne Family:<br />Arthur Majialenne--Patriarch, staunch foe of T'Ere, deceased<br />Kathrin Majialenne--Matriarch, imprisoned by T'Ere for decades, widely considered deceased<br />Carezzia Majialenne--Only surviving child of Arthur and Kathrin, travels with the animal companion Cat, raised in seclusion by Quildluane, she is largely ignorant of her family's past<br />Kaolinn the Gentle--Unacknowledged child of Carezzia's older (now deceased) sibling<br /><br />Miscellany:<br />Dranerius--Minor noble charged with maintaining deliveries to the docks of Freeport, betrayed by the Keeper to T'Ere, deceased<br />Keeper (of the Warrens)--Menial charged with the care of T'Ere's menagerie<br />Marlowe--Fuzzy, cuddly bear<br />Princess Joleena (of the Fey Court)--Adoptive mother of Descourge, highest ranking member of the Court to interact with the mundane<br />Quildluane--Adoptive parent of Carezzia, deceased<br />Serrapoth (of the Fey Court)--High Priest of the Fey Court prior to Descourge's ascension to the position, deceased<br />

T'Veren slid awkwardly into his chair amidst the clink of flatware and clatter of glass, acutely aware of how underdressed he was for the establishment.<br /><br />"My apologies..." he paused as a purple liveried waiter reached to pour water from a crystal decanter before continuing.  "Your summons did not leave me time to change into proper attire."<br /><br />"An invitation to dinner is hardly a summons.  Order what you wish; I'm buying and mine is already on its way."  The ogre sitting opposite T'Veren had already commandeered roughly two-thirds of the table with cups and plates.  Despite being in Neriak's Foreign Quarter, the ogre was an oddity, large even by the standards of his own people, belying the agility T'Veren knew he possessed.  The bright red uniform of the Hand further emphasized his unique status.<br /><br />"From you, Chief Inquisitor, any suggestion is an order."  The waiter fluttered at the edge of his vision.  "Just the bread..."<br /><br />"Bring him the almandine I had earlier and another plate of appetizers.  Oh, and some wine.  You must try the wine, Veren.  The red tastes of butter."  The ogre gestured and the waiter bustled away.  "Drop the 'Chief Inquisitor'.  We've known each other too long."<br /><br />"Fair enough, but don't pretend this is a social visit either."<br /><br />"Your call."<br /><br />"Right."  T'Veren sighed.  "My call.  Out with it."<br /><br />"Carried six of your men out of Down Under.  I'd like to know why."<br /><br />T'Veren screened his facial expressions with his water glass.  "What makes you think they were mine?"<br /><br />"We can play that game if you want."  The conversation stopped as a waiter poured the wine, placed a breadbasket at T'Veren's elbow, and, finally, slid a silver platter in front of the ogre.  Resting on a garnish of yellow grass was a black oval, easily two feet long and almost as high and wide.  "I'd like to keep this unofficial.  Formal inquisitions are, well, messy.  Don't you agree?"<br /><br />The Teir'Dal nodded.  "So, Chief Inquisitor, my friend, tell me about your day."<br /><br />"How nice of you to ask, friend T'Veren.  I was quietly sorting papers at my desk when I received a message from one of the 'Goon squads."  The ogre's tone began mockingly then dropped to a smooth rumble as he warmed to his tale.  "Alley full of bodies, not unusual in that area, but they were a little too professional for simple thugs--no personal effects, well-groomed, at least based on the remains, and not locals.  You know how, when you ask around, nobody knows anybody but you can always find some shopkeeper or other who says 'yea, usta shop here, dunno nutin' else'?  Not this time.  The 'Goons ran the usuals and no one even blinked.<br /><br />"They did turn up something else interesting, though.  It seems that the young Lord Rileaus had been traversing the area earlier.  Now, call it a hunch, but I think this all might be related.  It's a bit too early for T'Ere to start trying to arrange accidents for the boy but--oh, let's say another house wanted to stir up trouble.  Naturally, I thought of you.  Security for the House is, after all, part of your job and it would be a shame if something were to happen to your ward."<br /><br />"You're right, the wine is good," T'Veren noted casually.  "You said you thought the six men were mine."<br /><br />"Did I?  I must have misspoken.  Or perhaps they were yours, protecting the young Lord from possible ne'er-do-wells, of course."<br /><br />"Of course.  Doesn't matter too much, I suppose.  For simplicity's sake, let's assume that I did send them after Rene, in theory.  That isn't really enough to merit the attention of the Hand."<br /><br />The ogre nodded.  "True.  What one House does to another is not my concern.  Heresy and the security of Neriak itself, on the other hand, does."<br /><br />T'Veren was suddenly chilled.  "The incident with the Fey was settled decades ago.  What are you driving at?"<br /><br />The ogre did not answer.  He hefted a silver hammer with a rounded head and struck the black oval on the plate before him.  Two more sharp blows followed and the blackened surface cracked along a central seam.  The ogre worked the silvered jaws of a spreader into the split and twisted.  The shell burst open with a cloud of superheated steam to reveal puffs of a white meat inside.  "Relax, I'm not accusing you of anything."  He dug out a piece of the blanched meat with a two-pronged fork, dipped it in a nearby dish of melted butter, and popped it delicately into his mouth.  Without waiting to chew, he resumed speaking.<br /><br />"Let me ask a question.  In theory, if you had sent those men after Lord Rileaus, would you have any idea what killed them?"<br /><br />"None whatsoever.  I'd like to know that as much as you."<br /><br />"Good, I am theoretically relieved.  What about T'Ere?  Any idea if he was involved?"<br /><br />T'Veren shook his head.  "Not that I know of."<br /><br />"That makes it a safe bet that he wasn't.  I appreciate your assistance, Veren.  Anything else going on in the House?" <br /><br />"Nothing new, if that's what you mean."<br /><br />"Hmm.  Let's go back to the beginning then.  T'Ere moved against Rileaus because Rileaus interfered with a shipment in Freeport.  Mistmoore perhaps?"<br /><br />T'Veren shook his head.  "Routine shipment.  My turn for a question.  Why?  Some thugs die in an alley, how does that bring the safety of Neriak into question?"<br /><br />The Inquisitor gestured with his tine.  "Try this beetle, imported from Seb.  The six men died in two groups.  Best guess is they were interrupted.  Three went down deep in the alley, standard blade work.  It would appear that young Rileaus is good when he has to be.  Fourth body was also in the same area but the throat was torn out, no sign of teeth or claws, it looked to have been removed by brute force--knifed through the throat and levered out.<br /><br />"The other two bodies were at the mouth of the alley, very different story.  One had two holes in its chest, nice clean spikes, straight in, straight out.  Its back was cut to pieces, maybe used as a shield after he died.  And the last, the last body was stripped to the bone.  I've seen bodies like it but only after they've been dead for a few weeks.  Bugs, Veren.  Eaten alive by some kind of swarm.  Green husks were imbedded in some of the remaining tissue.  There are some priests that can summon swarms but nothing green--all of our people summon black beetle or carrion flies.  This was something different.  I'd guess Tunarian."  The ogre set his utensils on the table and fixed T'Veren with an unflinching glare.<br /><br />"The heresy of the Blue Queen spreads through your, our, people every day.  Despite my repeated admonitions, your Council of Nobles allows agnostic magi to shelter within the sacred walls of the city itself.  Our enemies storm the gates of Neriak.  How do we survive, Veren?  How is it that, beyond surviving, we prosper?<br /><br />"It is because of the gods, because of Innoruuk.  The gods have rules and boundaries, limits to their powers and where their followers may go.  Neriak is strong because it is a holy site and, therefore, under the direct protection of Innoruuk.  An avatar of Marr will not bring havoc to our city, no more than an avatar of Innoruuk will invade the halls of Felwithe--because the gods protect what is theirs.  We can send agents and war among each other but the gods will not, perhaps can not, act directly.<br /><br />"Unless!"  The ogre thumped the table for emphasis and flatware leapt.  "Unless we turn from them.  Unless we let heresy breed among us.  Unless we violate ancient bans and oaths.  Innoruuk protects us but only because we serve him.  And because we do not invite others in!  We can invite trouble, direct actions of the gods themselves, and forfeit the protections of Innoruuk.  House T'Enel did that once:  you offended him and his protection was lifted.  It will not happen again.<br /><br />"Let me be very clear on this:  if I even suspect that a House has invited doom into Neriak, I shall not hesitate to cut the heresy out."<br /><br />T'Veren gulped dryly and fumbled with his water glass, suddenly reminded that he faced one of the heads of the Inquisition within Neriak, one of the great powers who had no respect for rank or privilege, religious zealots with no restraint and little regard for life.  He swallowed again, well aware of how close to the edge of heresy his House skated, continued to skate even now.  His thoughts went again to the Feir'Dal imprisoned within the warrens.  "What can I do to help you, Chief Inquisitor?"<br /><br />"I don't know.  Thus far, I have little more than an anomalous death which may or may not be related to your House, or to anything else for that matter.  I want you aware and vigilant.  I want immediate report of anything that seems out of the ordinary.  I want any new menials who have joined the House retinue after, let's say the initial trouble with Rileaus, sent to an oracle to have their weird cast, in case you have been infiltrated by Mistmoore."  The ogre paused to eat another forkful of beetle.  "And most of all, T'Veren, I want you to know that, if anything happens, I'm coming for House T'Enel first."<br /><br />***<br /><br />Carezzia stared at the pool and bit her lip.  After all she had been through, the idea of scrying through time did not frighten her as much as what she might see.<br /><br />"The past,"  the Princess Joleena whispered beside her.  "I don't understand how it is controlled, if it is, but the pool will show you what is needful for you to see."<br /><br />"Will you see it too?"<br /><br />The fairy nodded.  "I will guide you as best I can."<br /><br />With no small trepidation, Carezzia brushed the surface of the water with her hand, watching images form like watercolored paintings...<br /><br /><br /><br />Two men in a dank cell.  One chained and haggard, the other free and robed in darkness and midnight blue felt, leaning on a gnarled staff.  Rush torches burn, one in the cell, others in the hall beyond.  The clink of keys and rustle of guards outside.  And somewhere, faintly, singing.<br /><br />"You are a thief," the cowled man said.  His voice was deep and smooth, almost without inflection, the purring of a tiger.<br /><br />The returned gaze was through swollen lids, the reply through blood-crusted lips.  "I am no thief."<br /><br />"That is too bad.  I had need of a thief.  I suppose I have no use for you and must leave you here to die.  I had high hopes for you Quildluane, very high.  Sorry to have troubled you."<br /><br />"Wait," rasped the prisoner.  "How do you know my name?  Are you one of them?"<br /><br />"If, by 'one of them' you mean the League, that answer is no.  I rather think that my presence here would upset them significantly.  No, I represent an interested third party.  But I needed a thief.  A thief with a conscience, true, but nonetheless a thief."<br /><br />The young Quildluane sagged against his chains.  "What do you need stolen?"<br /><br />"A simple thing.  A child."<br /><br />"No deal.  I have stolen songs, nothing more.  Better to die than be part of some evil that taints my immortal soul."<br /><br />The hooded figure nodded.  "As I said, a thief with a conscience.  I swear to you, there is no evil to this endeavor, save perhaps to prevent it.  The child is marked for death, even now its assassins move against it.  You must steal it to save its life.  A moral imperative, I would say."<br /><br />"Then why don't you save it?  You're the wizard."<br /><br />"What an odd assumption.  Why would you say such a thing?"<br /><br />"In my cell, in their dungeons, claiming not to be one of them?  Either you are a mage or a liar."<br /><br />"Ah, Quil, you truly are young.  Have you never heard of a bribe? That is why I need a thief.  I need you, in specific.  You know the ways through the League's Halls and can move with stealth where I cannot.  Come now, are you my thief or not?"<br /><br />The captive lowered his head wearily.  "And what of me if I am?"<br /><br />"I offer your freedom, to be sure.  That alone should stir you to action for your accommodations hardly seem to your liking.  But I will offer you more, rewards such as you cannot now imagine, and amnesty.  When we are done, your petty thefts will be long forgotten."<br /><br />"No one owns a song.  I am no thief; I am a liberator of art.  The League of Bards can no more own music than a druid can own the sky," Quildluane muttered.<br /><br />"Interesting analogy.  Have we an agreement?"<br /><br />"We do."<br /><br />The figure moved close, touching the rusting manacles which bound the other man.  They fell away at his touch.  His cowl gaped open to reveal white hair and beard, grey eyes the color of storms, aquiline features on a skin of chalky blue.  "I am called Serrapoth.  Listen well for we have little time..."<br /><br />Furtive movements in the shadows of the tree city of Kelethin.  Rope and grapple in the stillness of the woods.  Halls of wood, tapestried walls embroidered in golden threads in themes of lyre, pipe, and drum, the faint strains of music--dance and song.  An impromptu nursery, little more than a closet with a crib.  A babe, tiny, elfin, fierce eyes and futile cherub fists, unwatched in her sanctuary.  Bundled by Quildluane into a swaddled pack.  She did not cry.  And away, flight through the forests, unpursued, to meet with fairy courtiers in Lesser Feydwer.  Fairy and thief raising the girl, waiting, waiting, for a Serrapoth who never came...<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Carezzia drew away from the pool, her fingers wet, sweat upon her brow.  "That was me!  He stole me!" she stammered at Joleena.  "My most trusted friend, my mentor--he stole me!"<br /><br />The fairy princess brushed the elf's hair with a gentle hand as she cried.  "Hush, child.  All is not yet clear; look again.  Hush now and return to see."<br /><br />***<br /><br />The Keeper paused in the hallway, his ears catching the strained shouts of an argument.  Deciding that he could afford to delay his audience with the Lady Even'gel, he stepped to the closed door of T'Enel's office and cocked his head to listen.<br /><br />"We're talking about the Hand of Innoruuk!  This is the Inquisition, the Temple, the heart of power in Neriak, we can't just ignore it!"  The voice was T'Veren's, strained and almost pleading.<br /><br />"Relax, Veren.  Nothing has changed.  Whatever crimes we committed are long in the past."  T'Ere answered calmly, his tone disaffected.<br /><br />"Maybe, but this all started over the girl."<br /><br />"We lost the girl.  She's gone again and I'm deprived of my revenge.  Whatever might have happened didn't."<br /><br />"We still have Kath...the Feir'Dal.  What of her?  The Inquisitor suggested Tunare."<br /><br />"Doubtful, Veren."  T'Ere's voice became conciliatory.  "Listen, no servant of Tunare could survive in Neriak and remain strong.  We learned that with the Feir'Dal.  She's wasting away and all Tunare can do is let her die.  And I doubt that the Keeper is any threat to us.  He might be a spy from Mistmoore but even if he is, it's nothing that would concern the Hand.  Do as the Inquisitor asks.  Send the menials to the Oracles to be read and we'll deal with anything that arises from it.<br /><br />"For now, rest easily, cousin.  These events may not be related at all and certainly, they pose no threat to us."<br /><br />T'Veren sighed.  "As you say, m'lord."<br /><br />Outside, the Keeper pressed a gloved finger to the metal lips of his mithral mask, nodded to himself, and hurried quietly down the hallway.<br /><br />***<br /><br />"I can't," Carezzia whispered, her voice shuddering, her hands trembling.<br /><br />"You will," replied Joleena and shoved the Feir'Dal's hand into the pool...<br /><br /><br /><br />The creak of tree limbs, the groans of wood.  Fire crackled, instruments played.  The noises that passed for silence were deafening.<br /><br />A young Feir'Dal mother, newly widowed, sipped gingered ale, sharing dinner with a gaunt-faced elf, sallow and bald.<br /><br />"I can not express my gratitude, Guildmaster.  To rest, to know my babe lies safe within these walls..."<br /><br />The bard waved away her words and did not meet her eyes.  "Do not think on it; the Majilenne name is known to us.  Your husband died fighting the Mayong, did he not?"<br /><br />She looked away.  "You are a gracious host, but I must leave you soon.  I have no doubt they will be coming for my daughter and I."<br /><br />The bard shifted uncomfortably in his chair.  "The Teir'Dal?"<br /><br />"House T'Enel; T'Ere's men.  He's not the type to let Arthur's actions go unavenged."<br /><br />"I cannot help you there.  My order has no influence within Neriak.  I hope to change that soon enough."<br /><br />"Don't!"  Kathrine snapped.  "You cannot entreat with evil!"<br /><br />"I should have anticipated that reaction, given your recent travails, but I do believe you are oversimplifying the matter."<br /><br />"I'm not," she said with curt severity.<br /><br />The Guildmaster fixed his eyes on his plate.  "I'm sorry.  That was insensitive."  Kathrin did not reply.  The meal progressed in awkward silence.<br /><br />The pastel waters blurred and time sped by.<br /><br />Quildluane had been gone from the nursery for almost an hour before Serrapoth moved from his own place of concealment.  The child was safely away, and now his work began in earnest.<br /><br />"I have been away too long.  Dinner was pleasant.  I must return to my daughter."  Kathrin began to stand, then stopped as the bard grabbed her arm.<br /><br />"Please, stay.  Just a moment longer."  His grip tightened, his wan features were distressed, afraid and tense.<br /><br />"What are you--"  She cut short her protest as two strangers, one tall, the other taller, human, stooping in the bardic halls, entered the dining room.<br /><br />"This is her?"  asked the tallest, a voice as ice, the hunger of winter's winds howling.<br /><br />From his companion:  "It is.  Beyond question, it is."  The slithering of a snake, a simpering whine striated with command.  Hunger here too, a glutton's greed, never satiated.<br /><br />The Guildmaster released her arm.  "You must understand, Kathrin.  I have the long-term interests of the League to consider," he said, looking away, sullied.  "If we can establish a toe-hold in Neriak..."  His voice trailed off, drained by the spinelessness of his argument.  He edged toward the doorway.<br /><br />"Who are you?" she demanded, her voice fierce with maternity.<br /><br />"Oh, you know me."  The human visage wavered briefly and the serpent grinned.  "I wanted to attend to this personally.  We have so much to discuss, you and I."<br /><br />"T'Ere!"  Kathrin's voice was a mixture of horror and hatred.<br /><br />"And let me introduce my cousin, Veren.  Now where's that little girl of yours?  I'd love to meet her."<br /><br />Kathrin surged for the door, frantic.  The one called Veren caught her in his arms, pulling her toward T'Ere.<br /><br />The heavy wooden door to the dining room slammed.  The sound of the bolt sliding home was deafening.  A new voice spoke, soft, weary, resolute.  "I believe you have larger concerns at the moment."<br /><br />"I wondered when the fairy would come out of hiding.  Run out of people to hide behind?"  The rictus settled across T'Ere's face; the snake turned to coil.<br /><br />Serrapoth took a single step to one side, blocking the Guildmaster's slinking  retreat.  The fairy priest lowered his cowl and smiled indulgently at the disguised Teir'Dal.  "We're done here," he said to no one in particular.<br /><br />A shout, a blur of motion.  T'Veren shoved T'Ere with his shoulder, falling with him through a window, Kathrin still struggling in his arms.  A elder oak, quiescent in the night--its crest exploded, consumed in a fulmination of power, suddenly a torch large enough to light the continent.  Flaming debris breaking loose, falling like drops of crimson blood, spraying sparks and blazing cinders in renewed storms of fire on impact.  Kelethin ravaged...<br /><br /><br /><br />"Kathrin's body took most of the impact when T'Veren shoved them all through the window.  Even landing atop her, T'Ere broke both legs and it would be years before T'Veren healed from his burns," Joleena spoke quietly at Carezzia's shoulder as she pulled back from the pool.<br /><br />"So they lived?"<br /><br />Joleena continued as if she had not heard.  "The fall broke every bone in your mother's body.  She never healed."<br /><br />"They killed her?"<br /><br />"Eventually.  Best not to worry about it now."<br /><br />Carezzia almost screamed.  "Not worry!?  They took my life!  Killed my family!"<br /><br />"And revenge has been taken!" the fairy shouted back over the Feir'Dal's growing hysteria.  "It is over.  You are free from it.  Free from fear; free from the need for revenge.  It's done.  The debts are already paid."<br /><br />"But I was just captured by T'Ere.  He&amp;#8230;"<br /><br />"Has now been dealt with."<br /><br />"He's dead?"  snarled Carezzia.<br /><br />"There are worse fates than dead," the fairy replied.  "Rest and we will speak again."<br /><br />"That can't be all.  I need to know.  I need to understand what it was all for.  Please!"  The girl's voice was desperate and pleading, thickened with grief and stress.<br /><br />The fairy studied her in silence for long minutes then nodded, once.  "Sleep first.  The pool draws its energies from you and you are fatigued beyond your knowing.  You will see the rest.  I hope you are strong enough to understand."<br /><br />***<br /><br />The Keeper knelt, tapped the floor with his knuckles, then rose and moved deeper into the room, closing the door behind him.  "My apologies, m'lady.  I was detained."<br /><br />The Lady Even'gel waved away his words.  "We had not even noticed that you were late.  Our days pass easier now.  We summoned you to give thanks."<br /><br />"The cordial works then, m'lady?"<br /><br />"Too well," muttered Rene from a chair by the fire, its back deliberately turned to the meeting.<br /><br />"We are reborn, favored Keeper," Even'gel purred.  "Our life is made bearable.  Ah, but only just, only just."<br /><br />"I do not understand."  The Keeper tilted his head slightly to one side.<br /><br />"From the past to today, it as if we have been lifted from the deepest pit.  Yet, from today to tomorrow, we would have you lift us to the heavens."  As she spoke, the Keeper noted that her affected tone, imperial and husky, hid the slur creeping into her words.<br /><br />"Certainly.  We shall speak of it anon but I have yet to pay my regards to Lord Rileaus, if you will allow it?"<br /><br />"Rileaus?  Oh yes, Rene.  Of course.  We shall await."<br /><br />The Keeper looked at Even'gel cautiously then moved to kneel at Rene's side.  "We should talk," he whispered.<br /><br />Rene snorted.  "Talk away.  She doesn't hear anything that isn't spoken directly to her imperial self and sometimes you have to shout even then.  She's in her own world most of the time."  His tone was disgusted.<br /><br />"How much is she drinking?"<br /><br />"Of your blasted concoction?  The initial flask, the cask you sent up afterwards, and she's almost ready for another.  It's constant now; she never has a glass of it farther than arm's reach."<br /><br />"And the use of the imperial 'we'?"<br /><br />"Fairly recent, but she uses it now even when she's talking to herself."<br /><br />The Keeper growled low in his throat.  "Way too much.  I warned her.  I warned you. Wormwood can cause hallucinations and empolomine addiction toppled the Combine Empire."<br /><br />"Out of my hands," Rene said dismissively.<br /><br />"Out of mine now," the Keeper snarled and stood.  "Forgive me, great Lady.  We were discussing your affliction?"<br /><br />"You have our forgiveness, favored Keeper.  In our eyes, much may be forgiven you.  We no longer live with fear.  We no longer await our husband to make decisions.  We are as a true noble woman."  Even'gel took a deep theatrical breath and gestured broadly with her hands before continuing.  "But it is our husband whom we now must treat.  As our afflictions have been set aside, we ask that you now advise us in the treatment of our husband's."<br /><br />"The High Lord has fallen ill?"<br /><br />Even'gel laughed, high and shrill.  "Naught so simple.  It is a worm which has long grown within him.  There is no connection between us.  He is his own man and we are left to deal for ourselves.  This we did not even see until you opened our eyes.  You must help us to find a bridge into his heart, a meeting place of our affections.  Fair menial, we would have our husband back."<br /><br />"Forgive me.  I have been long out of the noble courts and your manner of fair and courtly speech has left me perplexed.  Let me ask plainly to see that I understand you wishes.  You want me to speak to the High Lord about--well, renewing his affection for you?  M'lady, I am an animal keeper.  Perhaps such matters would be better suited for a member of the priesthood or another family member?"<br /><br />"Family?  I fear T'Veren, in his way, is my fiercest rival."  She poured a glassful of her cordial and gulped it.  "No, we do not want talk.  We want actions--another tonic, an herb, whatever you feel is necessary."<br /><br />The Keeper sighed heavily.  "Dear lady, it is beyond my power.  I am no hedgemage to offer you false promises of a love potion.  Even between animals there is, in truth, no certain way to force these things.  A marriage must be an act of will, a thing of commitment and effort.  The rest will follow naturally.  As you have said, you must find a bridge to him, but it must be you who reaches out.  You have a shared past, there is much between you already.  Build from that.  Dwell on what you share and encourage him on these matters."  He studied the expression of her face carefully as it sagged into disappointment.  He hesitated, waiting as she sank back into a chair and dropped her face into her hands, before placing his next statement.  "You must find a shared spirit."<br /><br />Even'gel did not respond.  The Keeper waited then asked, "Lady, are you well?"<br /><br />"We shall maintain," came the answered, muffled by her hands.  "You may go."<br /><br />The menial shifted uncomfortably from foot to foot.  "A shared spirit, m'lady."  He partially turned towards the fireplace.  "Lord Rene, were my directions sufficient to lead you back from the warrens?  It was a longer route but easier to follow."<br /><br />"It was simple enough.  It would have been even simpler if you had mentioned the big, sealed door.  I was convinced I had made a wrong turn."<br /><br />"What door?" interrupted Even'gel, suddenly aware of her surroundings.<br /><br />Rene twisted in his chair.  "One of the tunnels in the Warrens has a double door--right on the side of the passage.  Iron bound door sealed with chain, lock, and the T'Ere signet sealing the lock--I was convinced I was going to come up in Lavastorm or somewhere."<br /><br />The Keeper watched as Even'gel's expression changed, becoming contemplative, calculating.  "A shared spirit indeed.  Beloved Keeper, you have been more than helpful.  If you will leave us now?"<br /><br />The Keeper lowered his head and pulled his cowl forward to hide his mask.  "A pleasure, m'lady."  His tone was satisfied.<br /><br />

Weeks, months, perhaps even years--as she rested, Carezzia came to understand that, in the realms of the fairy, there is no time.  They never hurried, never betrayed a sense of urgency.  Things happened in an order but not by a schedule.<br /><br />To learn how her family had been lost, to see all the sacrifices made on her behalf, for her security, was a terrible burden but she could accept it.  In many ways, she already had, coming to terms, over the years, with the absence of her parents and her estrangement from her family.  Her grief for Quildluane was fresher, more real and immediate, than for the parents she had never known.<br /><br />But to know that even revenge had been taken from her, that the fairy had contrived, even for the best of motives, to redress all of the ancient grievances, to insulate her from every aspect of the tragedies of her past, left her feeling as if she had been shut out from her own life, deprived in some way of even being herself, like a child so sheltered from the pains of reality that she was never allowed to truly grow up.  It galled her, ate away at her heart--a seed of resentment trying to blossom into something, she did not know what but it was dark and vile--and she began to fear herself as she swung between emotional poles of anger and despair.  And all the time, the fairy moved about her, oblivious to her anguish in their midst.  With all the time in the world to care for matters of honor and vengeance, they seemed blind to the consuming urgency and the fanatical, frustrated need for action in a mortal.<br /><br />Unnoticed by the young druidess, ice grey eyes watched her, knowing, gauging, waiting for the right moment.  Joleena alone understood the process that was taking place and, at last, summoned Carezzia again to the silent pool of mercurial scrying.<br /><br />The elf answered the summons in a fury, prepared to make demands, prepared to argue the injustice of it all, prepared for something, she was not sure, but certainly she would have her say even--if she did not know what it was she wished to say.<br /><br />Instead, before she could speak, the fairy's gaze froze her.  Utterly alien in its cold ruthlessness, Carezzia met the piercing stare that made the girl feel suddenly naked.<br /><br />"You believe that you are the center of the universe?" Joleena spat without provocation.  "That only you were affected by these events?  That yours alone is the claim to revenge?"  She pointed to the pool.  "Learn!"<br /><br />Carezzia let her hand trail across the pastel palette of the water and saw, even muted through the veil of time, a scene of horror...<br /><br /><br /><br />Rows of tables, stone, metal, wood, some new, some old and battered, all caked and stained with blood and ichor.  Feir'dal, whole and in parts, draped, strapped, laid across the surfaces.  Here, fresh blood still dripping from torn flesh.  There, rotting putrescence, long dead and ignored.  Eyes, glazed in death, pressed closed in barely living anguish, staring blankly in shock and madness at nothing.  The only light was that of braziers of coals, casting merciful shadows, flaring to brighter light when bits of flesh were tossed into them.  An abattoir of maniacal proportions...<br /><br />"No!" Carezzia screamed and jerked her hand away, liquid running from her fingers a deep red as if she had dipped them, not in water, but in blood.<br /><br />The fairy clamped her wrist in iron fingers and shoved it back into the pool.  "Look!"<br /><br /><br /><br />Among the bodies, one constant:  all were women.  Some, chained to the tables; on others, limbs had been severed.  In places, mutilated bodies of the dead had been cast disdainfully to the floor that the surface might be used again.  Cowled figures moved in the nightmare, black hands extending to poke and prod ravaged tissues.  Another constant, slow to emerge above the shock of the slaughter:  each Feir'dal had been eviscerated, a bloody cut from sternum to waist.  In some, the cut revealed an inner tumor of flesh, half children, twisted with malformation.  Other, full-formed babes lay dead alongside their carriers.<br /><br />"Did any of the investments survive?"  T'Enel's voice, hoarse, devoid of emotion.  <br /><br />"None."  A young T'Veren.  "This batch was better than the last.  Fewer miscarriages but all those we removed were either stillborn or too monstrous to live long.  You were right.  The fairy infusion seemed to stabilized the maternal systems.  Within a few more batches, varying the injections, we could have had a successful crossbreed."<br /><br />"There will not be any more batches.  That damned Majialenne saw to that.  A pity, to come so close...  Take the bodies down through the Warren tunnels and let the river wash them away.  We're done here.  Oh, and see to it that none of the servitors are left alive to speak of this."<br /><br /><br /><br />Carezzia pulled back with a shuddering breath.  "That was what my parents died to stop?  That was T'Enel's experiment?"<br /><br />Joleena nodded soberly.  "A transgression against even the gods themselves.  Feir'Dal women raped, impregnated by Teir'Dal seed to create crossbreeds with arcane power unseen since the Sundering.  He was distilling fairy blood into injections to keep them alive long enough to bring the spawn to term.  Light elf, dark elf, and fairy blood all in one being.  He wanted to do what only the gods have ever done.  He was creating a new race."<br /><br />Carezzia sat in shocked horror for long moments.  "But he was stopped.  He failed, didn't he?"<br /><br />The fairy noble did not answer and Carezzia reached back into the pool...<br /><br /><br /><br />Bodies half-dammed the bitter cold water of the subterranean river, forgotten in the bitter depths below Neriak, a silent mass of pale, bloating flesh, too cold and too deep for even insects to find.<br /><br />A robed figure struggled to keep balanced on the shifting, macabre terrain, searching for something among the ruin, stabbing downward with an iron staff for purchase on the slippery flesh.<br /><br />The form dropped to its knees and began to dig into the ichors.  In Carezzia's mind, she thought the searcher looked familiar, like Serrapoth, like Descourge, but different.<br /><br />He pulled something from the carnal mound.  A baby.  No, it was lightly furred and bore a tiny tail...a puppy?  The searcher wiped the wetness away from the creature's nose and mouth and delicately put it to his own.  Puffing.  Wiping mucous that ran from its orifices.  Puffing again until, at last, the tiny beast gave a whimper.  The searcher wrapped the cur within the folds of his robes and the waters swirled...<br /><br /><br /><br />"I...what was that?  Who?"  the young druidess stammered.<br /><br />Joleena did not answer directly.  "An aberrant birth, not even bipedal.  Dead but not so far gone that that he could not be reached.  The pup was suckled by a wolf-bitch for almost a year and hunted wild for that long again before the rangers in Surefall captured it.  For lack of understanding, they shifted his form to roughly human and raised him.  Truth be told, he was too wild, too vicious and filled with rage.  They were relieved when he left them to study with the Unkempt.  Given the circumstances of his birth, it was no surprise to me that my son chose to follow Karana.  I don't believe he ever really had a choice."<br /><br />Carezzia's mouth gaped open.  "The pup?  Yes, that was Descourge?"<br /><br />"Of course.  Who else could have been forged into such a tool for our revenge?"<br /><br />***<br /><br />"You are the Keeper of T'Ere's warrens?"<br /><br />The menial did not lift his gaze from the guard's heavy boots.  "I am."<br /><br />"The Seer is available.  You will go directly into her.  You will not vary in your path.  You will do exactly and expressly as she commands and you will do all of this without hesitation.  The Seer serves the Hand of Innoruuk directly and you will respect her accordingly.  Is all of this clear?"<br /><br />"It is."<br /><br />"Very well.  Enter."<br /><br />The Keeper shuffled down the stone hallway and into the room indicated.  Only when he was safely inside did he dare look up.  The room was both small and astoundingly spartan.  A Teir'Dal priestess sat behind a simple wooden table, a deck of cards cradled in one hand.  She motioned wordlessly to the room's only other furnishing, a chair directly across the table from her, identical to the one in which she was setting.  He sat and waited as she shuffled the cards from one hand to another, observing that, even by Teir'Dal standards, she was a surprisingly small woman.<br /><br />"Do you understand why you have been summoned here?" she asked at length.<br /><br />"Not completely, no, m'lady."<br /><br />"Be at ease.  This is a simple thing, little more than a formality.  The Lord T'Veren has requested a reading of the weird all personnel newly acquired within his house.  It is a simple precaution against betrayal.  I shall lay the cards to read your weird and, unless you are more than you say, you may return to your duties.  Simple enough, is it not?"<br /><br />"I simply sit here?"<br /><br />"Exactly so.  Be patient as I concentrate upon you."  She began to lay cards in front of her in a pattern.  "Just a single pass, I think.  There's no reason to read too deeply on a servant."<br /><br />She began to flip the cards over, speaking lightly as she did so.  "Oh, the Magus of Power.  Be flattered, you are wise.  Four wards, good worker.  Ace of Swords reversed, hmmm, usually disaster but could be a reference to T'Enel's tyranny over his help.  And, here central..."<br /><br />The Seer's voice trailed off as she stared at the card face up on the table.  Painted across the placard's face was a wolf facing dexter below a seven-tined antler.  A long spear was superimposed over the top of both, centering the card.  In the deck of a Feir'dal seer, such a symbol would be called The Hunter.  In the deck of the Teir'dal, the card was not used.<br /><br />"Your coming is not wholly unexpected," she eventually said in a strained voice.  "You could easily kill me before I called for help."<br /><br />"Messy," the Keeper replied casually.  "It would make the rest of my work difficult though not impossible."<br /><br />The Seer licked her lips nervously.  "There is no love lost between the Hand and the House T'Enel.  An agreement, perhaps?"<br /><br />"Your life for your silence?  I think not.  It is too cheap, too easy to betray me later."<br /><br />"Then I will ask for more, to make the bargain valuable."<br /><br />The Keeper nodded.  "I can appreciate that."<br /><br />"Duty requires I have your assurance that you are not acting against Neriak, the Hand, or Innoruuk himself."<br /><br />"I can give you that easily.  The cards have already told you as much or you would already have tried to call out.  I assure you, this is, indeed, personal and specific."<br /><br />The priestess bowed her head.  "Then grant me this:  I shall hold your secret.  In exchange, you will look favorably upon my family, now and in the future...including my son.  He is in exile and disgrace but..."<br /><br />"But he is still family.  I accept your offer."  The Keeper stood.  He reached and lifted the Seer's hand to the lips of his metal mask, as if in a kiss.  "It has been a genuine pleasure."<br /><br />***<br />Sweat beaded nervously on T'Veren's upper lip and his breathing was too fast.  Behind a thin mask of calm, his mind raced.  He was a warrior, a risk taker, and he knew fear--only a fool did not--but this, the beast which stalked the periphery of his mind, this was worse.  It was dread.  Fear was a quicksilver clench on the battlefield; this was meaner, the fear of fear, a millstone, slow and sure.<br /><br />He was the foremost of the trio threading their way through the labyrinth depths of the caverns beneath Neriak.  Rene followed him closely and Even'gel brought up the rear, humming happily to herself.<br /><br />She was mad; he was certain of that now, lost completely in whatever dank world of fantasy her mind created for her.  But she was also the wife of his Lord, he could no more defy her orders than grow an additional limb; it simply was not in him.  To do so would run contrary to decades of loyal service and, within the maelstrom which was the House of T'Enel, the immutability of his character was his only anchor of self.  No, T'Veren would not unman himself and flee though every fiber and instinct in his being screamed at him to do so.<br /><br />Even'gel was dangerous in the way only the truly mad could be:  detached and ruthless, utterly without scruple for, in her psychosis, no rules, no visage of commonality remained, only her desires and the implacable will to achieve them.  Over the past month, T'Veren had seen her obsession with T'Ere grow in proportion to her madness.  She clung to her husband with the brutal, desperate savagery of a drowning woman to a swimmer, dragging them both down with her struggles.  It was a sadistic cycle, twisting back upon itself as a snake consuming its own tail.  By clutching, she drove him further from her, driving T'Ere to increasingly hurtful, painful, even physically violent rebuttals.  But these rebukes were attention nonetheless and she fed upon them, turning them in her mind into gestures of affection.  As T'Ere's resentment grew, so too did Even'gel's instability and her pleasure.<br /><br />T'Veren had seen it all play out, horrified yet unable to turn away, hopeless  to avoid the familial tableau as it stretched before him.  He had felt it as well, a swelling tension, a hunting dread, the absolute, grinding pressure leading up to something.  What, he could not guess, but it was there, the feeling, like an animal in the forest, unable to see its hunters yet knowing as sure as sight that the net was closing in around him.<br /><br />She had sent the boy, Rene, to him with her summons--a watchful eye to insure that he complied immediately, that he would not detour to alert T'Enel.  He felt the rope about his neck then and knew he had no choice but to accept it, to ride out the whirlwind and hope to survive, blind but afraid.  When, upon reaching her, she had silently handed him the heavy, corroded iron key he had thought safely locked away deep within T'Enel's most carefully hidden secrets, he had hesitated.  For one, long second the world was still, crystal and sharp, his heart hammered upward into his throat, almost gagging him.  Then he had bowed his head to the yoke and taken the key, leading the way down, into the caverns, into the past.  What purpose she had in taking the boy to the dark machine beneath, he did not even question.<br /><br />He paused again at the lock of the door, another crystal moment of turning, a fork in the road of fate.  T'Veren steadied his hand, turned the key, and entered a chamber inviolate for half a century.<br /><br />The level of the floor was a lie.  A few yards into the chamber the floor fell away below, the ceiling vaulted above, and in the pit and in the arch stood the machine, the lingering key of the blasphemy of House T'Enel.  Despite it all, T'Veren still looked upon it and saw majesty in the metal beast.<br /><br />"The Lady Even'gel would have T'Veren explain the function of this device.  Rene should understand," crooned Even'gel behind him as she entered the chamber.  He kept his face averted to hide his discomfort.<br /><br />"We distilled the fairy," he said softly, almost reverently, the words echoing in the massive chamber, the cathedral of the machine.<br /><br />The entry ledge over-looked the hopper, a low railing of iron along its edge.  They had designed for convenience, placing the most often used part right at the doorway.  They had made it large, as well.  The fairy were so small; it took so many to make even the tiniest amount of serum.  Elsewhere, the ledge launched into catwalks deeper into their creation.  It needed almost no maintenance; T'Enel and T'Veren had designed well, but the occasional bone could clog part of the tubing.  They had never fully solved the bone problem.  Other issues had been more pressing.<br /><br />Several feet down, within the funneling sides of the hopper, the gratings began.  Razor-wires strung from copper frames, criss-crossing in a grid.  Iron had been too heavy and difficult to work, easier to replace the copper when it wore out.  The wires slid within the frames and the frames slid across each other to create a web of slicing metal, sieving the fairy into a stringy pulp.  The upper grating was set above the others, hinged in the center, set to flip when weight dropped upon it.  The fairy could fly, a lid had been necessary.  Out of sight below the hopper, T'Veren knew the rendering vats would still be bubbling.  They had taken advantage of a natural fissure of lava for their heating source.  Parts of the machine reflected its dull red light.<br /><br />"We took from them the very essence which made them who they were and drained it off into a serum," he added, leaning against the iron rail and gesturing broadly.  From the russet pits, long tubes reached into the chamber's zenith.  Great swooping coils of brass raced above the machine, twisting like mating snakes in the embrace of lead pipes bringing cooling water from the rivers of the warrens.  The lines met but never their contents.  The distillate must remain pure; the water lines were for condensation.  In the end, deep within the machine on a suspended platform through a maze of catwalks, T'Veren knew that the brass spirals met together and ended in one, singular nozzle and, below that nozzle, a flask--always a flask.  A hundred fairy might be slaughtered to fill the carafe just once; not a drop could be wasted.  It had been incredibly difficult but they had done it.  Together, the two men had come so very, very close...<br /><br />T'Veren laughed, his own touch of madness emerging.  "We put their souls in a bottle."  It was terribly funny.  "We decanted their spirits.  It's a pun, you see."<br /><br />"A shared spirit," Even'gel said primly and Rene shoved T'Veren, off-balance, over the railing.  The grating closed and the razored loom wove.<br /><br />

"The rest is straightforward," Joleena explained.  "Dessy was, of course kept ignorant of his heritage until he was ready to take his rightful place in the Fey Court as Serrapoth's successor, but we watched him closely.  After he left Surefall, he wandered the frozen mountains and the forests, growing increasingly feral.  What little of human customs he knew, he rapidly forgot and even his speech atrophied.  To this day, he is more fluent in Fairy than in the Common Tongue.<br /><br />"When we began to fear that he was slipping too far away from human to be useful, I contrived for him to meet and marry Maeve.  There have been difficulties, but his family has kept him loosely tied to the mundane world."<br /><br />Carezzia held up her hand to interrupt.  "I'm getting a bit lost.  Who do you mean when you say 'we'?"<br /><br />"Primarily Karana and I, although Tunare certainly has had her input, as has Innoruuk."  The fairy waited politely as Carezzia choked and coughed violently.<br /><br />When she recovered from her surprise, the druidess asked, "And Maeve?  Who was she?"<br /><br />"Well, as I have said, she was the Ancient's wife.  She was also my daughter although you must never let him know that.  I believe the Feir'dal called her Mab, the Warrior-Queen.  Maeve was her avatar for that generation."<br /><br />The elf shook her head to clear it.  "What then?"<br /><br />"We arranged for him to fight in the Dark Elf wars and, predictably, he turned out to have an affinity for war.  Then, to our surprise, he became a pacifist of sorts."<br /><br />Carezzia laughed.  "I've read that part in his notes.  They were not fighting the war right, so he decided that if they were not going to fight to win, he would not fight at all."<br /><br />Joleena nodded then quoted with a mock severity:  'How long can you press your face against the enemy until you become a mirror of what he is?  Good and evil fall by the wayside and this so-called war is but an excuse for gratuitous bullying on both sides, with no intent of changing anything.'<br /><br />"It's even funnier when he turns around and says 'If it is worth fighting for, it is worth killing for.  If it is worth killing for, it is worth murdering for.  By this I judge no war is as effective as a single assassin and the greatest show of power is to not fight at all.'" Carezzia added.<br /><br />The fairy smiled.  "He is right, in his way.  And you notice that most of his gentle nature was a cover for a deep-seated rage.  He is certainly no pacifist when it comes to defending his family.  Ah dear Carezzia, that is why he takes revenge for us, not you.  You are family to him, a debt incurred by the fairy before he was even born, but family nonetheless."<br /><br />The Feir'dal smiled.  "I like that.  It's comforting in a strange way."<br /><br />"I'm glad you approve.  Where was I?  Oh yes.  After the war, he returned home to find that Maeve had died.  We almost lost him then.  He became almost a complete hermit.  He had learned to change form by then so he was impossible to find.  Fortunately for us, his love of his daughters was stronger than his grief, and he eventually came back.  Once they were grown, he went back into hiding to write but he always kept an eye and an ear on the world outside."<br /><br />"And the Erudian?  Where does she fit into the picture?"<br /><br />To Carezzia's surprise, Joleena snorted and scowled.  "I do not like her.  My granddaughters think she is the next incarnation of Mab, come back to look after Descourge, but I rather doubt it.  Still, she has been loyal to my Dessy and an adequate partner.  I've no more to say on that matter!"<br /><br />Carezzia quickly changed the subject.  "How does this tie back to Quildluane's death and my capture?"<br /><br />"When you came back to Lesser Fey, you closed the circle.  It gave T'Enel one last chance to either capture you or to show that he had learned from the punishments already inflicted and, thereby, escape a more extreme judgment.  Obviously, he has not learned and chose his own fate."<br /><br />"You said 'punishments already inflicted.'  What was that?"<br /><br />"His plan offended all the gods, not just ours.  Innoruuk let his only son die and struck his wife barren, a horrible fate for the master of a noble house."<br /><br />Carezzia nodded slowly to herself.  "And Quildluane?  How did he die?  Did T'Enel kill him?"<br /><br />The fairy reached to hold the elf's hand.  "No.  The Ancient did.  Your mentor had been captured by the Mayong's troops.  He was too old and injured already.  Dessy couldn't heal him or rescue him so he killed him to spare Quildluane from torture.  If it is any consolation, he also hunted down the Mayong's agents.  None of them returned home.  I'm sorry, dear.  I know it's a harsh thing, but he thought it best."<br /><br />Carezzia shook her head and cleared her throat.  "No.  It's all right.  I understand."  She smiled without humor.  "I'm a druid.  Death and suffering seems to be an integral part of our calling.  And now?  What becomes of us now?"<br /><br />Joleena grinned and squeezed her hand.  "Now?  Dear child, now we proceed with our lives.  For us, this war is over.  It's time to let it go."<br /><br />***<br /><br />"Keeper!"  Kathrin's voice was harsh, scratching its way out of her throat.  "Keeper!" she shouted again then collapsed forward, wrapping her arms protectively around the searing pain in her chest.  Her mouth was so dry that her tongue was numb.  Her entire body ached just from the exertion of pushing herself upright and her eyes burned, the edges of her vision wavering with tears.<br /><br />The hands that steadied her were gentle but the merest touch forced her to bite back screams of agony.  A clay cup was pressed to her lips and she tried to drink, half the water flowing down her chin instead.  "I'm sorry," the Keeper whisper to her.  "I've done all I can."<br /><br />"How much longer?"  she gasped.<br /><br />"Days, I'm sure, no more.  Don't die, not yet."<br /><br />"One last stab at T'Enel."  She tried to smile at that but could not summon the effort.  "My children, you'll care for them?"<br /><br />In her fevered state, clinging to a life already stretched beyond its limits, she had asked this question repeatedly.  The Keeper answered her as he always did.  "As my own--blood of my blood, bone of my bone."  The words seemed to soothe her and she slipped into a restless sleep.<br /><br />***<br />[Warning:  The following section contains instances of extreme domestic brutality.  Though not rendered at a gratuitous level, these scenes may be disturbing.  Reader discretion is advised.] <br /><br />"Damn it all," growled T'Enel, "Where are the servants?"  He hefted a fluted glass from the table and threw it across the room, enjoying the action and the satisfying crash when it hit the wall.<br /><br />Even'gel was coddling her dog and looked up.  "The Lady Even'gel has sent the servants away that she might enjoy a quiet dinner with her husband."<br /><br />T'Enel clenched his teeth to keep from shouting.  Her insipid use of the third person was like a rasp drawn across his already taut nerves.  A headache was perched behind his eyes like a fat imp beating his brain with a hammer.  At least dinner alone with Even'gel reduced the number of irritations in his life down to one; he would not have to deal with that simpering fool Rene.<br /><br />"Where is T'Veren?  He's been gone for two days now," he complained aloud.  "He knows I can't manage two houses without help, curse him.  If he wasn't my cousin, I'd have him killed just for abandoning me!"<br /><br />Even'gel fluttered a hand at his seat and began to light candles, one from another.  "Do not trouble yourself over these small things, husband.  Sit and eat.  Rediscover your lost love."<br /><br />He rubbed his temples and sat, ignoring her words.  If he could simply tolerate her through this meal, then he could return to work, maybe even get some decent sleep tonight.  He would have to spend the night in his office; otherwise Even'gel would suck the life from what little rest he did get.  He looked across the table to her sallow face and glassy eyes and wondered again why he had married her.  Surely even the power and money the marriage had gained him was not worth this millstone around his neck.<br /><br />"It is suitable?" she asked, seeing his gaze, and T'Enel nodded, eating mechanically.  He washed down the food with a wine almost as tasteless and even saltier.  Even'gel was talking, prattling on about some trivial part of her day; he did not listen, his mind racing forward to dwell on the work that awaited him in his office.  Perhaps the Rileaus brat could help after all; at the least he could run errands while T'Enel worked.  He swallowed another mouthful of the wine.<br /><br />"Where's Rene?" he asked aloud.<br /><br />"The Lady Even'gel has sent him away that she might be alone with her husband.  She has sent him to deal with the great distraction which has consumed her beloved these many years."<br /><br />He squeezed his eyes tight against the pain in his head.  "What are you babbling on about, woman?"<br /><br />"Does the Lady Even'gel's husband not find the wine uniting?"<br /><br />"Even'gel!"  He slammed his fist into the table.  "Enough of your prattling!  What are you talking about?  I'm in no mood to play this game of yours.  What is going on?"<br /><br />"The wine."  Her eyes pooled and her lower lip trembled.  "Do you not like the wine?"<br /><br />T'Enel sank back into his chair.  "The wine is fine," he lied and, to prove his point, gulped the last of it with a grimace.  "What is the big deal about it?"<br /><br />For a moment, he saw her, a flash of the Even'gel he had married, indeed loved, a frightened child peaking out from behind her glassy eyes.  "I miss you, T'Enel.  I wanted us, together.  I did it for us.  We needed a shared spirit."<br /><br />Something in her tone lifted the hair on his neck like a cold wind and he stood, speaking gently.  "Even', what did you do?"<br /><br />The mask was back in place now and she retreated, pressing herself back in her chair.  "The wine.  High Lord T'Enel has loved T'Veren his entire life.  Now same T'Veren has served his house most nobly, binding husband and wife with his shared spirit.  Why, by the very creation of his own hands."<br /><br />His head was pounding; his stomach knotted around a fist of stress and an ill-settled meal; Even'gel's sentences were almost impossible to follow then, in a terrible moment, it all locked into place and T'Enel gripped the edges of the table to keep from falling.  "You fed T'Veren to the machine?" he asked softly, incredulously, then again.  "You fed T'Veren to the machine.  And the wine&amp;#8230;"<br /><br />T'Enel flung the table aside in a crash of glass and silverware.  "You killed T'Veren!  And served him to me like food!"  He advanced on her menacingly, hand lifted to strike at her.<br /><br />He had forgotten the dog--the accursed, overfed, pampered dog.  It growled and snapped at him.  T'Enel kicked at it, the toe of his boot catching it just under the front shoulder.  It yelped and lunged at him, fat and clumsy, tearing the cloth of his breeches.  Furious, T'Enel dropped on it with both knees, a hand on its neck.  The other hand searched behind him, finding a knife, stabbing the struggling mutt in the throat until it stopped struggling.  He stood and threw the knife to one side and kicked the dog's body contemptuously.  <br /><br />Even'gel flew at him, the ineffectual protests of a woman, crying and beating lightly on his chest.  He slapped her then, to shut her up, to push her back.  She startled and pulled away, fixing him with a venomous look.<br /><br />It all rushed up then--the frustration, the anger, the barely realized horror--in the face of that hated look.  As though she had any right!  He hit her, hard.  No slap this time, a solid right jab into that loathsome face.  It felt good.   Something within him tore, and something felt released.  As she raised her hands, he hit her again.  The rage was better than the headache.  He hit her again, knocking her to the floor.  And again when she tried to rise.  Again and again until she did not struggle anymore, until she stopped crying, until she stopped moving, until the moist pulp beneath his fist ceased to crunch with bones, until all resistance was gone.  And then he remembered:  "She has sent him to deal with the great distraction which has consumed her beloved these many years."<br /><br />"Kathrin," he spat and began to run, down through the halls of the House T'Enel toward the warrens.  A guard saw him, covered in splattered blood, wild-eyed and running, and moved toward him.  T'Enel shoved him aside with a snarl, then turned and jerked the sword from the guard's hands, leaving him standing behind, transfixed by his confusion as T'Enel continued to run.<br /><br />When he burst into the central chamber of the warrens, T'Enel saw Rene, standing over an unconscious Kathrin, hesitant, not quite ready to kill in cold blood.<br /><br />"Get away!" he roared at the boy and Rene turned his head, blade pointed at the prostrate elf.<br /><br />He saw then that the Feir'dal had not been unconscious after all.  As Rene turned, she forced herself upward with her knees and elbows, a look of pure hatred fastened on her face and, staring at T'Enel, a sneer crept to her lips.  Before he could move, she threw herself forward, onto Rene's blade.<br /><br />The boy never had a chance to react.  Even as he turned in surprise to see Kathrin's corpse sliding from his sword, T'Enel struck him.  The blow was an overhand, more suited to ax than sword.  It cut through his shoulder, shattering the clavicle, then twisting when it hit the upper ribcage, tearing across Rene's chest and through his left lung, wedging in the broken sternum.  Rene collapsed, gurgling in the froth of his own blood.<br /><br />T'Enel ignored him, releasing the trapped weapon, and fell to the ground, cradling Kathrin's body in his arms.  He did not look up until the Keeper was standing almost atop him.  The menial's bandaged hand now sported two long rods ending in flesh-hooks protruding from the back of a leathered gauntlet.  Casually, as though mindless of the surroundings, the Keeper reached with his free hand to remove his metal mask and cast it aside.<br /><br />"Serrapoth?" T'Enel asked incredulously.  The resemblance was uncanny.<br /><br />"No," the Keeper replied.<br /><br />"Then who--what--"<br /><br />The Keeper laughed sharply.  "You want an explanation?  Gods know that&amp;#8217;s more than I ever got."  The Keeper knelt in front of him and pressed the tips of the flesh-hooks into the soft skin beneath T'Enel's eyes.  "Not Serrapoth,  something more primitive and yet, more modern.  Do you not recognize your own creation?"  The Keeper pressed the hooks harder, into the flesh, and pulled down slowly, forcing T'Enel's eyes to gap open.  "All of this, you did.  All the death, all the sorrow, everything here is yours.  Oh, they planned it but, for a certainty, you earned it."<br /><br />T'Enel raised a hand and etched a sigil into the air.  "By Innoruuk, I&amp;#8230;"  His spell was cut short as a searing pain lanced his arm.  He looked to see the hand and arm wither to a brittle stub.<br /><br />"Never take an oath lightly," the Keeper said dispassionately.  "You swore the Oaths of the Dead, after all.  That was the tricky part, you know.  To remove even the protections of your own god from you."  The Keeper pulled on the hooks, forcing T'Enel's gaze back to his own and winked at him with a nictitating membrane.  "Everything else was planned by the gods but this moment, this one right here, between you and me, they left to me.  My payment, I suppose; my chance to take revenge as I saw fit.  Probably expected me to kill you."<br /><br />T'Enel waited, drained of energy, tired of caring and awash in confusion.<br /><br />"No,"  the Keeper continued.  "I think that I shall give you the one thing which you gave to me, that would be better than revenge, don't you think, to give you justice?  No family, no house, no hope--just life."  The flesh-hooks wrenched down and away, tearing the flesh of T'Enel's eyelids and cheeks, flooding his eyes with hot blood.<br /><br />As he fell, blind in blood, awash with pain, T'Enel felt the body of Kathrin  taken from him and then the rest was silence as he was left, waiting.<br /><br />***<br /><br />On the rocky slopes of the mountains that rise at the northern edge of the western plains of Karana, a small grove of conifers wrings out a solitary existence.  Within the sheltered copse, the wind is a constant sigh and a permanent blanket of brown needles covers the earth beneath.  It is a graveyard of sorts, a type of family plot.  There are no headstones, no monuments, only low cairns of rock laid to preserve the memory of those buried beneath from scavengers.  The number of graves is low, barely distinguishable from the other rocky outcroppings in the area--a wife, a granddaughter, a few sons--and now, one other.<br /><br />The Ancient dug the graves by hand, neither tools nor talents, only the power of his hands, driving into the packed soil, tearing free the clods and stones, prying with broken fingernails.  Physically, he was a poor match for the land and it took its toll upon him.  Skin broke and bled, nails shattered or tore painfully away from his hands, bones would crack and still he would dig, staining the new-cut grave with his own blood, tears, and sweat.  It was a flagellatistic act, a personal atonement for the dead, an external suffering in accord with the internal grief.  It was, by symbol and sorrow, a sacrament as holy as any formalized process and more personal.  Stripped bare of pretense, it was the losing struggle of one man's will against the unforgiving stoicism of nature, and utterly pointless.  Yet whether the act was one of thurification and unction by suffering or a futile gesture of selfish pride, no power above or below would gainsay his right to this most personal of rites--the burial of one's own dead.<br /><br />Satisfied with the depth, he laid the body within, moving slowly, for that was the only speed clenched muscles and exhaustion would allow.  The placement was gentle, as though tucking a child in to sleep.  As he replaced the dirt into the grave, he laid each handful with care, tender as though the deceased were only resting and not to be disturbed, covering the face last and smoothing the soil with the bleeding palms of his hands.  He paused to bite away a torn and hanging strip of flesh from a gash on his forearm, then turned to the stones.<br /><br />Each rock was examined, turned full about and every angle scrutinized by eye and rubbed by hand before its placement.  The cairn was perfect, each stone fitting together like pieces of a giant puzzle, solid and secure, permanent with neither mud nor mortar, streaked russet from bloodied fingers.<br /><br />Done at last, Descourge stood and did nothing--standing and looking down for unmeasured time--no words were spoken, no eulogy given, nothing to indicate "Here lies Kathrin Majialenne, family."  It was enough to know what was.<br /><br />As he had worked, day had passed into night and now crept back to day again.  He turned and walk down from the mountains, unhurried, caught in a moment of ritual outside of time.  He walked for miles, out of the foothills, across the plains and farmlands, to the banks of the slow, muddy river.  Into the river he walked until its waters rose to tease at his beard.  Only then did he stop.<br /><br />He sank, fully beneath the water, robes and hair floating out in a strange dark halo, the marks of his labors flowing away, into the bosom of the river, the blood, the salty mud, the grief of the body.  The grief of mind was his own to keep.<br /><br />Six more times he dipped himself within the river before he was clean.  He strode back to the shore and shook himself like a large, wet dog and twisted his robes to squeeze the weight of the water from them.<br /><br />Some distance away, jutting up from the brush and weeds of years of unchecked growth, rose a fire-blackened chimney.  Near the chimney, flat paving stones formed what might once have been a walking path, perhaps the sill of a doorway.  It was to here, to these ruins retaken by the land, he walked now, meet by the hefty bear cub running in a rolling gait.<br /><br />The Ancient smiled thinly as the bear pushed against his legs with its head.  "All right, Marlowe.  Let's go home."<br />

It was two years before Carezzia saw the patriarch of her family again; he had gone to ground and even her newly acquired family would not break his silence.  When Joleena had relented and agreed to send for him, Carezzia's courage had flagged and she had considered not seek him after all.  She was to be married, to a Teir'dal--an exile who had renounced his people but, given her surrogate father's past, she was afraid of his reaction.<br /><br />She need not have worried.  He had come, dressed all in black leather, sternly distinguished.  Meeting the young dark elf who was her suitor, Descourge had laughed suddenly, shook his head in bemusement, and given his blessing.  <br /><br />To her utter delight, the Ancient had given her away, answering the ecclesiastic's "Who gives this woman" with a stern "Her mother and I do."  As he said it, Carezzia had felt her mother's spirit as solidly as she felt the ground beneath her feet.  Upon this moment of pure joy, another glimpse of the layered mystery that was his life was added.  "And who shall speak for the character of this man?" had been answered in the same stern voice with an answer a riddle:  "In accord with assurances given to the Oracles of Neriak, I vouchsafe for him.  He finds favor in my eyes."  No explanation had been offered; she had intended to ask him about it during the reception but, of course, the aging druid had already gone, vanished back into his self-imposed exile.  He had left her a gift in the keeping of her eldest sibling:  a small, clay cup, no inscription, no explanation, another enigma.  But she was happy.  It was enough.<br /><br />***<br /><br />Dearest Sister Carezzia,<br /><br />I trust this finds you well and that your honeymoon was a joyous one.  We have not heard from Father.  I'm sure Grandmother knows where he is but, well, you already know that she is as tight-lipped as he is.  I think they both love secrets as much as they love their children.  The Kerrans speak of a hermit in Stonebrunt who gives candy to the children in trade for catnip and protects the villagers from poachers.  I have my suspicions.<br /><br />During your reception, you asked me a question and, in the hubbub, I didn't get a chance to answer.  It's just as well, explaining why we call Father "Ancient of Days" is tricky.<br /><br />When we were little, before Mama died, they used to sing us to sleep.  It was an old lullaby in fairy.  We didn't understand most of the words, of course.  I got all the words and the translation from Grandmother a few years ago.  The lullaby was a duet.  Father would sing the first half of the line and Mama sang the ending, like a conversation.  After Mama died, it was like he forgot her part of the song.  He was just kind of stuck in his half of the song, like it was all that he had left to describe himself without her.  I don't know a better way to put it.  It was sad.  He's still sad, I think.  <br /><br />Anyhow, I didn't write you to upset you.  I checked with Grandmother, just to make sure, and I wrote the words out for you.  It's translated so the rhythm is all messed up but here it is.  We miss you and I hope you come visit soon.<br /><br />With Love, Your Sister<br />A.<br /><br /><br />To sift through bitter ashes...and find the singed relic<br />To speak in lifeless tongues...that they may never fade<br />To reflect on past injustice...to learn mercy and seek grace<br />To endure the pressing darkness...looking toward the coming dawn<br />To live when hope is gone...for life is more than dreams<br />To dig the graves of children...and know the fields will flower again<br /><br />Standing in the breech...a time to stand alone<br />Weakened from the fray...a time to stand with others<br />Broken from the wars...a time to stand with family<br /><br />This is the duty...which I have chosen<br />This is the cost...which I will pay<br />For I am become...Ancient of Days<br /><br /><br />[Our little play is done.  Performers exit stage right and Curtain.]<br />
