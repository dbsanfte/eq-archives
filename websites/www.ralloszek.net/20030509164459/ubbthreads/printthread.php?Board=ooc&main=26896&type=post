I seem to have a problem making myself clear sometimes <img src="/ubbthreads/images/graemlins/smile.gif" alt="" /><br /><br />I guess my passion is my downfall when it comes to arguements. <br /><br />But, onto Iraq.<br /><br />A few things concern me about this planned reconstruction of Iraq. The first is, nobody knows for sure whether or not we actually got Saddam Hussein. Hussein is a cagey fellow, and he's very intelligent. The Bush administration severely underestimated just how wily he really is. He had the forethought to have speeches taped in the event he was separated from his advisors. He has encouraged his own people to engage in suicide bombing, he has authorized his military to murder civilians, he has set up military headquarters in hospitals and holy sites. He doesn't give a damn what happens to his people, and if I were him, my butt would have been the first one out of Baghdad long before the missiles started flying. <br /><br />Secondly, yes the factions are going to be a problem, but Iran will be a real threat. The volatility of Iraq (and its closeness) was one of the things helping to keep Iran in check. Unlike Iraq, Iran actually has WMDs. I'm worried that we're going to slice the head off of one monster just to watch another sprout up in its place. Bush and that embarrassing "axis of evil" comment didn't help either. <br /><br />I'm not even going to go into North Korea or any other nation that feels its been shafted by the US...<br /><br />In keeping with the saying "an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure" some basic tact and a lot less arrogance could have prevented a lot of what we have to "cure" with strong-arm tactics and threats now.
