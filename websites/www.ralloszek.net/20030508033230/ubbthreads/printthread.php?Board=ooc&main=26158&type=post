Yeah. Pretty much. ;-)<br /><br />Don't take it as a slam, Rhawn, as that truly wasn't my intent -- Longtime readers can surely attest to the fact that, were that my goal, it wouldn't have been anywhere near as subtle.<br /><br />If you note the timeline my comment was directed towards you'll notice that I'm refering to an era when peeps were still confused as to whether LV had gone PK or if Guznuk, Timon and the rest of the HiV folks that joined had become Antis -- This isn't a veiled insult. It's simply the way it was.<br /><br />In any case.. The main thrust of my point was that people have been proclaiming RZ to be a dead server since Kerry got his ass banned and, no matter how passionate the prophet, the server was doing just fine the last time I checked.<br /><br />I suppose I did get a little rowdy prematurely with Tusk... I've been offline for a while so perhaps my diplomacy and tact are a tad rusty. But it drives me totally f'ing nuts to see so much goddamned whining from so-called PKs when it comes to [censored] like levels, gear, why they can't do X uber mob cause of training AD-Lite fuckwits, etc, etc etc and etc.<br /><br />You...<br /><br />[Note: I'm using "You" in a general sense... Don't get your panties in a snit. ;-)]<br /><br />... Can't get flagged for exping in UberZone01? Well cry me a river -- Go kill someone, goddammit.<br /><br />Artfully Yours,<br /><br />Nnuk<br />Master of the Arts<br /><a href="http://www.artfuldeath.com" target="_blank">Artful Death Gallery</a>
