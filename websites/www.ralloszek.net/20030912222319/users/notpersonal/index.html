Honor before everything.The Nothing Personal Player Association (PA) is a group of like-minded players that grew from a core of real life friends with origins in EverQuest.  Our home in EverQuest was the Rallos Zek Server, the cut-throat PvP server.  Most of us enjoy PvP combat and hope to avidly participate, while others are more of the non-combat creative types.  As a group of players we are mature and organized when it comes to PvP and PA business, but we are laid back and full of humor.  If you cannot take or do not enjoy harmlessly picking on your friends then this is not the PA for you.  Even though Nothing Personal is a laid back PA, orders are expected to be followed, but should rarely be given.  The formation of the PA is such that a council of leaders runs the PA, and even then everyone in the PA is expected to voice their opinions on most issues.  Nothing Personal is NOT a dictatorship, but on occasion some issues will be decided and mandated by the council or leader.  Even though our PA is a military organization with a defined hierarchy, we strive to maintain a family atmosphere in our PA.
