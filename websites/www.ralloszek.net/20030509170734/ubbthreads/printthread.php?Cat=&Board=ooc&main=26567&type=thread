Well you can argue about it if you so desire, but no one else has. The simple fact, not opinion, is that there are men and women who have and will lose their lives because they choose to, for you and me and him and her and... etc... Whether anyone *agrees* with the reason they are there, they are, and every damn one of us (primarily addressed to those in the US, the UK, Australia) ought to be bowing down to kiss their asses at any available moment and feel fucking priveleged to do so. I said "support our troops" (I won't argue with that, I'll just tell you that you are wrong if you disagree); I didn't say "Agree with the *cause*", because that is all based on personal feelings, beliefs, views, and I won't get into that here for obvious reasons.<br />Just consider this:<br /><br /> </font><blockquote><font class="small">Quote:</font><hr /><br />  Whether or not we agree with the war with Iraq, the troops deserve all the support we can give them.<br /><br />The average age of the military man is 19 years. He is a short haired, tight muscled kid who, under normal circumstances is considered by society as half man, half boy. Not yet dry behind the ears, not old enough to buy a beer, but old enough to die for his country.<br />He never really cared much for work, and he would rather wax his own car than wash his father's; but he has never collected unemployment either. He's a recent High School graduate; he was probably an average student, pursued some form of sport activities, drives a ten year old jalopy, and has a steady girlfriend that either broke up with him when he left, or swears to be waiting when he returns from half a world away.<br />He listens to rock and roll or hip-hop or rap or jazz or swing and 155 mm Howitzers.<br />He is 10 or 15 pounds lighter now than when he was at home because he is working or fighting from before dawn to well after dusk. He has trouble spelling, thus letter writing is a pain for him, but he can field strip a rifle in 30 seconds and reassemble it in less time in the dark. He can recite to you the nomenclature of a machine gun or grenade launcher and use either one effectively if he must. He digs foxholes and latrines and can apply first aid like a professional. He can march until he is told to stop or stop until he is told to march.He obeys orders instantly and without hesitation, but he is not without spirit or individual dignity.<br />He is self-sufficient. He has two sets of fatigues: he washes one and wears the other. He keeps his canteens full and his feet dry. He sometimes forgets to brush his teeth, but never to clean his rifle. He can cook his own meals, mend his own clothes, and fix his own hurts.<br />If you're thirsty, he'll share his water with you; if you are hungry, his food. He'll even split his ammunition with you in the midst of battle when you run low.<br />He has learned to use his hands like weapons and weapons like they were his hands. He can save your life - or take it, because that is his job.<br />He will often do twice the work of a civilian, draw half the pay and still find ironic humor in it all. He has seen more suffering and death then he should have in his short lifetime.<br />He has stood atop mountains of dead bodies, and helped to create them. He has wept in public and in private, for friends who have fallen in combat and is unashamed.<br />He feels every note of the National Anthem vibrate through his body while rigid attention, while tempering the burning desire to 'square away' those around him who haven't bothered to stand, remove their hat, or even stop talking. In an odd twist, day in and day out, far from home, he defends their right to be disrespectful. Just as did his Father, Grandfather, and Great-grandfather, he is paying the price for our freedom.<br />Beardless or not, he is not a boy. He is the American Fighting Man that has kept this country free for over 200 years. He has asked nothing in return, except our friendship and understanding.<br />Remember him, always, for he has earned our respect and admiration with his blood.<br /><br /><hr /></blockquote><font class="post"> <br /><br />

Sorry, I gotta head off to class in a few, so I can't make too much of a response right now.<br /><br />My father served active duty during the time of the first Gulf War. I was a military brat the first 17 years of my life, and believe me, I agree that the servicemembers fighting this war over in Iraq as well as the forces in Afghanistan deserve our respect and admiration. They're doing their duty for their country, and unlike some job you can just quit if it gets too bad, you don't lay down your duty until its done.<br /><br />My problem is with the statement demanding that those who do not agree with this war should go eat bullets in Afghanistan (I believe it was Afghanistan). <br /><br />I was just wondering what the point of making that statement was?

I don't want to go into a rant with an anonymous person ( for once! :P ), but I'll say this...<br /><br />That thread is abound with meaningless double standards and ignorance.<br /><br />"This war" started 10 years ago, with the world's consent.

Im not an American, but I think one of your Senators made a great speech (Senator Byrd) when he said last month..<br /><br />*Start of quote*<br /><br />"I believe in this beautiful country.  I have studied its roots and gloried in the wisdom of its magnificent Constitution.  I have marveled at the wisdom of its founders and framers.  Generation after generation of Americans has understood the lofty ideals that underlie our great Republic.  I have been inspired by the story of their sacrifice and their strength.  <br /><br />But, today I weep for my country.  I have watched the events of recent months with a heavy, heavy heart.  No more is the image of America one of strong, yet benevolent peacekeeper.  The image of America has changed.  Around the globe, our friends mistrust us, our word is disputed, our intentions are questioned.  <br /><br />Instead of reasoning with those with whom we disagree, we demand obedience or threaten recrimination.  Instead of isolating Saddam Hussein, we seem to have isolated ourselves.  We proclaim a new doctrine of preemption which is understood by few and feared by many.  We say that the United States has the right to turn its firepower on any corner of the globe which might be suspect in the war on terrorism.  We assert that right without the sanction of any international body.  As a result, the world has become a much more dangerous place.<br /><br />We flaunt our superpower status with arrogance.  We treat UN Security Council members like ingrates who offend our princely dignity by lifting their heads from the carpet.  Valuable alliances are split.  After war has ended, the United States will have to rebuild much more than the country of Iraq.  We will have to rebuild America's image around the globe.<br /><br />The case this Administration tries to make to justify its fixation with war is tainted by charges of falsified documents and circumstantial evidence.  We cannot convince the world of the necessity of this war for one simple reason.  This is a war of choice.  <br /><br />There is no credible information to connect Saddam Hussein to 9/11.  The twin towers fell because a world-wide terrorist group, Al Qaeda, with cells in over 60 nations, struck at our wealth and our influence by turning our own planes into missiles, one of which would likely have slammed into the dome of this beautiful Capitol except for the brave sacrifice of the passengers on board.<br /><br />The brutality seen on September 11th and in other terrorist attacks we have witnessed around the globe are the violent and desperate efforts by extremists to stop the daily encroachment of western values upon their cultures.  That is what we fight.  It is a force not confined to borders.  It is a shadowy entity with many faces, many names, and many addresses.<br /><br />But, this Administration has directed all of the anger, fear, and grief which emerged from the ashes of the twin towers and the twisted metal of the Pentagon towards a tangible villain, one we can see and hate and attack.  And villain he is.  But, he is the wrong villain.  And this is the wrong war.  If we attack Saddam Hussein, we will probably drive him from power.  But, the zeal of our friends to assist our global war on terrorism may have already taken flight.<br /><br />The general unease surrounding this war is not just due to "orange alert."  There is a pervasive sense of rush and risk and too many questions unanswered.   How long will we be in Iraq?  What will be the cost?  What is the ultimate mission?  How great is the danger at home?  A pall has fallen over the Senate Chamber.  We avoid our solemn duty to debate the one topic on the minds of all Americans, even while scores of thousands of our sons and daughters faithfully do their duty in Iraq.  <br /><br />What is happening to this country?  When did we become a nation which ignores and berates our friends?  When did we decide to risk undermining international order by adopting a radical and doctrinaire approach to using our awesome military might?  How can we abandon diplomatic efforts when the turmoil in the world cries out for diplomacy? <br /><br />Why can this President not seem to see that America's true power lies not in its will to intimidate, but in its ability to inspire?  <br /><br />War appears inevitable.  But, I continue to hope that the cloud will lift.  Perhaps Saddam will yet turn tail and run.  Perhaps reason will somehow still prevail.  I along with millions of Americans will pray for the safety of our troops, for the innocent civilians in Iraq, and for the security of our homeland.  May God continue to bless the United States of America in the troubled days ahead, and may we somehow recapture the vision which for the present eludes us."<br /><br />*End of quote*<br /><br />I also support the troops and hope that the job can be done with as little suffering and loss of life as possible. I don't extend that same support to the politicians. This war may very well have been inevitable, but to rush into it with only the flimsiest legal argument may have made the job so much harder for those troops that I support.<br /><br />Of course, if the war is illegal, my country could be held to account before the International Courts. The USA will not, because the USA has refused to sign up to any international agreements (including those on biological and chemical weapons). <br /><br />I also have to say that I support my country's troops most, though I also support all of the soldiers there. Thus far, however, we have lost more lives to American fire than we have to Iraqi. I do hope that those responsible for "blue on blue" incidents get held to account.<br /><br />I fear that this war is creating a whole new generation of terrorists. I think that would have not been the case if we had allowed more time for inspections and built international support. The whole world was in sympathy with the USA after 9/11... how quickly that has evaporated!<br /><br />I also fervently hope that the promises made to focus on a resolution to the Israel/Palestine issue were honestly made and were not simply "spin". The support of a country that was founded on terrorism and has been in breach of 68 UN resolutions for over 20 years must be seen by Middle Eastren countries as an anachronism.<br /><br />I could go on.. I won't.<br /><br />There have actually been some very good threads on the subject on the Ascending Dawn boards <br /><br /><a href="http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showMessageRange?topicID=1939.topic&amp;start=1&amp;stop=20" target="_blank">http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showMessageRange?topicID=1939.topic&amp;start=1&amp;stop=20</a> for anyone interested... Taranna argues very eloquently.<br /><br />Lastly, now that we are there, it is *vital* that we finish the job this time, and I support our armed forces 100% in their efforts to do so.<br /><br />Riatsila

Did I not say in my first or second response to you that I FULLY support the troops?<br /><br />Yes, I did. Go back and read it again if you need to.<br /><br />Alright, I'm going to clearly outline my position on this war just so there's no further misunderstanding about where I'm coming from on this. <br />1. I support the troops. <br />2. I agree that Saddam needs to die.<br />3. I agree that this war is necessary.<br />4. I just wish the first Bush administration hadn't done a half-ass job.<br />5. I don't trust "Dubbya"<br />6. I don't trust the puppet-masters of "Dubbya" (Rumsfeld etc. if you needed clarification on that one)<br />7. I frankly couldn't trust that whole administration as far as I could throw it. <br />8. I am a red-blooded American.<br />9. As a red-blooded American that appreciates liberty and democracy and apple pie, I don't believe that anyone should be made to feel that they cannot express their opinions. <br />10. I find it doubly hard to swallow when I hear other AMERICANS advocating just that.<br />11. ONeonite is obviously not an American, nor are (I'm guessing by the bad grasp of English) the other people who posted on his board.<br />12. Does the fact that ONeonite is a resident of another country mean that he has no right to express himself or has no room to disagree with this war? I believe he has every right to say what he feels, just as you have every right to say what you feel. Just because he's not American doesn't make him any less of a human being.<br />13. Accusing his people of electing a "Hitler-type" was flat-out uncalled for. <br />14. I could give a damn if you don't give me an apology, though I surely think ONeonite deserves one. <br />15. If you don't agree with anything that I've said (and you have every right not to agree with me), I'd simply ask you to go refresh yourself on the American Right to Free Speech. <br />16. If you don't agree with the American Right to Free Speech, I have to wonder if you wouldn't be happier in Iraq or in Afghanistan. <br />17. Finally, if I'm still managing to miss your point, you'll have to explain it to me. As far as I can see, you aren't really making one, but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt.<br /><br />P.S. There's always room for sarcasm.

Blimey! (note: just to establish my Britishness <img src="/ubbthreads/images/graemlins/smile.gif" alt="" /> <br /><br />Steinuh, I think all accept your point that the troops deserve support. Its the "go eat a nuke" comment that rankles a bit. It's a bit like the line that one often hears from Americans that says if you don't like what the current leadership (and the writer) say and do you should go and live somewhere else. It leaves little room for dissenting voices in a free democracy. <br /><br />For the record I don't believe you meant it that way at all. I think you said it simply to lend further impact and to demonstrate the strength of your support.<br /><br />Rube, I just wonder who is the puppet.. Dubbya or Rumsfeld and crew? <br /><br />On a different topic, I wonder what the exit strategy for Iraq is. You have the kurds in the North, the Sunni and the Shia (among other groups).. who does the country get handed over too? What happens if some parts (kurds?) want their own independent state. Will Iraq be the new Northern Ireland? How many terrorists will it produce if it isnt possible to satisy all factions?<br /><br />I do hope there IS an exit plan, and we arent just making it up as we go along.<br /><br />Riat<br /><br />

I seem to have a problem making myself clear sometimes <img src="/ubbthreads/images/graemlins/smile.gif" alt="" /><br /><br />I guess my passion is my downfall when it comes to arguements. <br /><br />But, onto Iraq.<br /><br />A few things concern me about this planned reconstruction of Iraq. The first is, nobody knows for sure whether or not we actually got Saddam Hussein. Hussein is a cagey fellow, and he's very intelligent. The Bush administration severely underestimated just how wily he really is. He had the forethought to have speeches taped in the event he was separated from his advisors. He has encouraged his own people to engage in suicide bombing, he has authorized his military to murder civilians, he has set up military headquarters in hospitals and holy sites. He doesn't give a damn what happens to his people, and if I were him, my butt would have been the first one out of Baghdad long before the missiles started flying. <br /><br />Secondly, yes the factions are going to be a problem, but Iran will be a real threat. The volatility of Iraq (and its closeness) was one of the things helping to keep Iran in check. Unlike Iraq, Iran actually has WMDs. I'm worried that we're going to slice the head off of one monster just to watch another sprout up in its place. Bush and that embarrassing "axis of evil" comment didn't help either. <br /><br />I'm not even going to go into North Korea or any other nation that feels its been shafted by the US...<br /><br />In keeping with the saying "an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure" some basic tact and a lot less arrogance could have prevented a lot of what we have to "cure" with strong-arm tactics and threats now.

Steinuh and my boss, Shirley, have every right to say "go suck a nuke" or "all those damn protestors should have their citizenships taken away!" I might say something to refute them because I think such statements reflect poorly on all Americans (whether they agree or not), but they have a right to say those things. I have my right to disagree. It's all good. Of course, I'm wondering how long that will last with "Operation: Homeland Secure-A-Titty" in effect.....<br /><br />&gt;I support the right of the Dixie Chicks to say whatever the hell they want about Bush.

No, you can't go doing things like that without generating a lot of hatred and fear across the globe, just like we're doing now. <br /><br />Like it or not, the US is the super-power in the world right now. We're the big kid on the block. We have responsibilities. We can't go around beating the snot out of other countries just because we want to. That creates unnecessary hostility and it isn't good for the world as a whole. <br /><br />

I just want to give my support to a thread that is more then "my dick is bigger then your dick, etc...". Though this thread has at times wavered that way... it's at least interesting.<br /><br />To throw out some interesting ideas on the issue at hand, I recommend you take a look at the concept of the "Just War". <a href="http://www.utm.edu/research/iep/j/justwar.htm" target="_blank">http://www.utm.edu/research/iep/j/justwar.htm</a><br /><br />This gives a more managable handle on the issues at hand. I do beleive that the Iraqi military is not at all following any  sort of ethical conduct in the war, but I do beleive that the United States did not have enough justification to begin a war. Why haven't we followed the foreign policy we've taken with Iraq with other dictatorships and governments that brutalize their people? If it's simply an issue of non-compliance to the UN, then why isn't this an UN action? There are alot of unanswered questions and the Bush admninistration seems unable or unwilling to answer them clearly and reasonably.<br /><br />-Arravis
