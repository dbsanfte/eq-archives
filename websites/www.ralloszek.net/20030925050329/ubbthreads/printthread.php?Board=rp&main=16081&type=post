Outside his stall, he heard the hum of bazaar life. Inside, he had dressed ceremoniously in his full suit of green Ivy Etched chainmail, bow and swords, spitpolished, shining and at his side. He smiled as he grabbed the ring he had been looking for, and slid it into his pocket, securly, making sure it wouldn't be jostled out when he wasn't paying attention. Ring pocket, he looked at himself in the body length mirror on the wall. He licked his hand and fixed his neatly brushed dark brown hair. Perfect. He nervously smiled at himself, and exited, making for the Nexus. As he ran down the corridor, he heard his lady yelling, "Hurry, we have to go very very soon!" "I'm comming," cried the ranger as he ran through the hall, bumping and stumbling past other people. "I had wanted to be more ceremonious about this but please," He lept up the stairs to the main platfrom in the Nexus, fell to one knee and presented the ring to the lovely high elven enchantress he kneeled before. Her beautiful face almost winced as she realised what was going on, "Oh... baby..." She said, resting a hand on his shoulder. "Oh God... baby..." Kelleher took her hand in his and kissed it, "Take the ring my love... I would trade all the women of Norrath for your sweet companionship. Of all, I love you the most, and I would that you would love me too, and accept my ring so that we might be joined in matromony." A tear streamed down her pale white cheek, as she said, "No, baby... I'm so sorry." She gasped slightly, to hold back more tears. "I just can't... I still haven't gotton over being left at the alter..." "I'd never leave you," Kelleher pleaded, "Not on darkest, fiercest plane, not in frozen frigid tundra, not in scorctching hot sands. Not when the odds are stacked against us, and the rest of the world has lost faith, never will I leave you. Not even at the alter." Another tear rolled down her cheek as she looked down at the ranger, realising things had gone terribly wrong. She slide the ring back in his hand. "I'm sorry...." She said as static began to fill the air in the chamber. In a few flashes of light and clouds of smoke she and her raiding party had dissapreared... And there stood the ranger, alone, on his knees, clutching the thin, gold, band.</i> <br />Kelleher Ivyelm<br />51st Level Half Elven Pathfinder<br />The Archer of Rallos
