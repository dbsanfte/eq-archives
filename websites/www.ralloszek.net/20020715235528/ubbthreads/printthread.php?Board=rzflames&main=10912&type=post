Ok... so after all this, you're just going to lean on your only ace in this discussion, which is "it's my toy!"  Fuckin moron...<br /><br />"As for whats going on with me and Lullee.. is between her and me... Doesn't really concern anyone here"<br /><br />If you noticed, I said the same thing.  Only thing it has to do with me is that people argue ALL THE TIME, yet you close a thread where I argue with her?  You MAKE it our concern.<br /><br />"All you two and many others have done is BITCH"<br /><br />Why don't you quote all the times where I bitch?  You can't.  Plain and simple.  I might complain sometimes, but no more than most.  You are so far out there you can't even imagine what is really happening, can you?  Wake up, simpleton...  <br /><br />"OOC board I put up for people to have civil conversations where they can just talk and people don't have to filter through tons and tons of people like you"<br /><br />Ok.. so me having to filter through tons and tons of pointless bickering about the current newbie PK guild is better than actual, well-thought, posts?  You again prove your lack of mental worth.<br /><br />"why don't you try pointing out some good things and how to make things you don't like better.."  <br /><br />Ok, start with not judging people that post here.  Whether they be good or bad, smart or stupid...  It's not your concern if you are trying to host a haven for a public community.  If someone gives bad info, are you going to ban them?  What if they say something the wrong way?  God...  Why do I feel like I am writing this to a 2nd grader???...   lol<br /><br />"alot of people here appricate the hell I get from you and the expenses I pay out of my own pocket for this place where I get nothing but bitched at.... so you two can just for f*** yourself... "<br /><br />First off, classy finish to that paragraph, mr "we need a language filter"...<br />Secondly, you get nothing but bitched at?  As far as I know, the last time you got bitched at was the LAST time you were a moron.  While you were fixing the site, you were getting praise, not bitching.  It's a simple if - then equation...  "If you act like a stupid, spoiled child, then people will laugh at you."  Learn.  Learn quickly.<br /><br />lastly-  "I haven't asked a single person from this site to help with the expenses..."<br /><br />No.. you just mention that every single time someone doesn't play with your toy the way you want them to.<br /><br />Get over yourself, Datal... it's a WEBSITE.  Not a fuckin reason for living....  <br /><br />As for me being "fuckin stupid"?  <br /><br />..<br /><br />heh...<br /><br />Ahh.. nevermind... I think we all know the difference between you and I.  ;^)
