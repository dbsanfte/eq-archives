Hello Cyber Adventurers, much to the dismay of many of you I am sure, I voted against turning off the bad word filter.  These anti-censorship views might be just fine and dandy on the MTV, but not for us roleplayers.<br><br>Seeing as how Everquest is an RPG in a medieval setting, there is no reason for a character to use bad words.  People in those times did not use the same curse words that are used by.. ahem.. "l33t d00ds" today.  Now you might say, "but but but Blart!  This is an OOC board!"  That doesn't matter - it's an OOC board about a role playing game.  If there is no reason to curse in-game, there is surely no reason to curse when talking about the game.  You also might say "but but but Blart!  The filter is an option!  You can just keep it on!"  That's just not good enough, everytime I see the word [censored], an image of a four letter word is conjured up in my mind, and I'm sure in the minds of others.  What if someone were to see me reading these?<br><br>What if one of the little girls in my neighborhood fell off her bike, or was given chloroform accidently, and I was forced to take her into my house overnight, and she woke up and saw me reading a message with the word [censored] all over it? What would she say to her parents about me?<br> <br>If everyone is forced to have the language filter, especially the hispanics, they will learn not to curse.<br><br>Datal, please think about the integrity of Rallos Zek's finest messageboard before giving into the mindless mob that's invading this poll.  Allowing foul language is feeding all that is bad about games and the media in general.  I am bombarded by curse words in music, literature, films, and NASCAR events everyday.  Can't there be one wholesome place for my young neighbors and I to relax?  <br><br>
