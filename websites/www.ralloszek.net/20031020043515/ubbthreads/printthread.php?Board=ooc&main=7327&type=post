"Afraid not. It's just a club for the blubie anti's to feel safer with the rest of the herd, so they won't feel like hunted sheep so much. How can you call it a general purpose forum when it seems to be designed specifically as a place where the anti's can gang up and rip the "Evil PK's". If you're going to host a public forum, you need to try to have an objective view when you make posts with your admin tag flying. The debates raging here seem to be generated from the fact that the owners of this site publicly choose sides between a debate over the alignment of fictitious beings, then berate those who don't share their opinions. If you don't like it, change this sites name to "RZ.Net Anti's Club", or something else that more closely matches your true intentions with this site. " - FoH Events<br><br>Did you just tell someone who is voluntarily exerting effort to run a site that you and your guild obviously use somewhat regularly what he "NEEDS" to do? If I'm not mistaken, he doesn't NEED to do anything but whatever he chooses to do. <br><br>What kind of pompous ass comes on to a site they have no obligation to visit as well as no control over it's content and tells the creator what he NEEDS to do? The guy can do whatever the hell he wants to do, jackoff, as can you. In your case, your options include visiting or not visiting. Those are your options, the same as his include posting what he damn well pleases. <br><br>I am by no means a huge fan of Datal, his opinions or his guild, but I am sensible enough to appreciate this site that he moderates and allows us all to post our opinions/auctions etc. on. <br><br>Whatever small ounce of respect I may have ever had for FoH was discarded with these last several posts, which HAVE to qualify as some of the most assinine, ignorant comments I have ever heard on this forum. Quit bitching and go somewhere else, jerkoff. <br><br><br>
