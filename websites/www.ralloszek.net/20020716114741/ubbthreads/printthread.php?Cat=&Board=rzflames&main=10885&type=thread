I guess this is the only place where I can speak my thoughts on this board anymore.<br /><br />I don't like people who cry racism when there was none involved.  I like it less when the board's admin backs up the fool because they're close.  Somehow, some people thought I was being racist.  I don't see it...<br /><br />So... here's the rant-<br />Datal-  Stop being a little boy and open your mind to viewpoints other than your own or the people who control you.  Just because you have the power to ban someone does not mean you should EVER do it.  You obviously did not read the whole thread when the only idea I got from ya was "lovaelihn, stop bitchin and moanin"... I claimed nothing about race, and your silly little girl stated I did, crying racism.  That stance is ignorant.    ( Lulee-  note my use of the word "ignorant" )  My opinion is this-  You got offended because many people called her names.  Awwww.... poor datal... did someone misuse YOUR toy?  =P  Cry me a fuckin river.<br /><br />Lulee-  You cannot even understand the most simple of my points, so unless you come up with something fresh, I am done discussing this with you.  Everyone who read that thread knows you to be a fool, and that is fine.<br /><br />So, in closing, I am sure that my opinion will probably get me banned although this is the place I was told to post it in...  ( See?  I am even following your biased self-righteous guidelines )<br />Oh well... Praytell... is this a place for discussion of our opinions?  Is this a place for discussion of YOUR opinions?<br /><br />The heading underneath the "OOC Forum says, "Forum to discuss all OOC topics."<br /> That should read "Forum to discuss all topics datal sees fit for his own viewing pleasure."<br /><br />Thanks, have a nice day.   :grin:

I think your being a little harsh on Datal, the thread was getting out of hand. <br /><br />But I agree with you 100% that you were not being racist. Hell, they talk like that in game it's not a big deal. And when I use the term they yes I am refering to the people in Peacebreakers. When I played they were very nice people IF they liked you. If not they were complete a-holes just like anyone else.

Listen, missy... It's threads like that which are the reason most of you people even have an RZ.Net board to bloody read.<br /><br />This friggin place had all of a dozen readers/posters/admins when I first showed up and the reason it was so desolate was because...<br /><br />(drum roll)<br /><br />... People were not allowed to say a [censored] thing without being "moderated" into oblivion.<br /><br />The kind of [censored] that rejuvinated this place were the Imperien/Kyoshou threads. The Ordieth/Petunia threads. The Cynara/Aumvar threads. The Nnuk/Every [censored] Anti In Existence threads.<br /><br />Out of hand indeed! PFFT!<br /><br />The original "clique" may not have liked it but, dammit, that is the stuff which made Ralloszek.net more popular than the Ralloszek.com of old -- Not the touchy feely "Letter to Cynara..." bullshit which dominated this obscure corner of the net at the time.<br /><br />And while I'm on the subject -- ok.. so it's another subject but so f'ing what? -- Lov was NOT being "too hard" on Datal.<br /><br />If anything he showed a shitload of restraint in light of yet another display of overemotional bullshit put forth by the Pop-Tart Admin -- I like Billy but DAMN! Shutting down the most read threads is [censored] ridiculous!!!<br /><br />And, finally... You'll notice I'm [censored] cursing a lot in this post. Why? Cause I wanna see if that [censored] censorship filter bull-[censored]-[censored] is in effect on what is [i]supposed to be[/i] a "free" board.<br /><br />Artfully Yours,<br /><br />Nnuk<br />Master of the Arts<br />[url=http://www.artfuldeath.com]Artful Death Gallery[/url]<br /><br />PS I'm still waiting for an explanation regarding the "Your girl" comment.<br /><br />Is Billy [censored] -- online or otherwise -- Lulee or what?

Thanks, Nnuk.  <br />That's pretty much the opinion I wished to convey, but being involved in the argument from the onset makes it difficult to handle all the issues at once.  I didn't want to write a 3 page essay, because I really don't care enough.<br /><br />Censorship fuckin sucks. <br /><br />Well, I could sit here and rephrase everything that's been said,  but I think it will fall on deaf ears.  Those who understand the point already get it, and those who don't are not capable of gathering this simple of an idea, apparently.<br /><br />"Your girl" was in regards to Lulee and Datal's back and forth discussions in several places on the board, and other things.  I don't exactly know/care what the relationship is, but it's obvious they are close.  My opinion is that the whole reason why the thread was shut down was because she was really looking stupid.  Maybe he didn't have the balls to tell her how stupid she looked, or maybe he agreed with her.  Either way, it was childish.<br /><br />Here's a test... go to the www.darkenbane.com board, and say "Meter sucks donkey dick!"  (Meter is the admin there)<br />I bet the thread won't be closed down.  Meter doesn't need to worry himself with that.  <br /><br />Datal should spend more time fixing this damn site, and less time being a nazi.  ( and don't cry racism again, please... this is obviously a negative reference to a horrible mindset )<br /><br />Ban me for it, datal-  Ban me for saying all these bad things about you.  It'll just prove me more right than I already am (if that's possible).<br /><br />

Ummm I would turn the filter off if I could... However the filter is entire site or not... And welll I like it on for most of the site.  I will look into a way to make it board specific.. but you know... None of you all pay me to do this... None of you help pay the cost... Your not the one incuring the $280 bill every 6 months... Nor the other $100 yearly fee I pay for some of the updates... So... If you all still want a site to talk and [censored]... Calm down some... I haven't asked a single person from this site to help with the expenses... and what are most sites doing?? They are going to a paid membership me I am leaving it free... I have already recieved a notice by my admin saying why the hell am I using so much bandwidth... So bitch at me all you want but remember if I wasn't willing to put alot out for you all this site wouldn't be here... Remember what Petunia did... He just closed it one day... no notice... nothing... Ohh where you not around then??   Well some of us were and I know alot of people here appricate the hell I get from you and the expenses I pay out of my own pocket for this place where I get nothing but bitched at.... so you two can just for f*** yourself...

Ok... so after all this, you're just going to lean on your only ace in this discussion, which is "it's my toy!"  Fuckin moron...<br /><br />"As for whats going on with me and Lullee.. is between her and me... Doesn't really concern anyone here"<br /><br />If you noticed, I said the same thing.  Only thing it has to do with me is that people argue ALL THE TIME, yet you close a thread where I argue with her?  You MAKE it our concern.<br /><br />"All you two and many others have done is BITCH"<br /><br />Why don't you quote all the times where I bitch?  You can't.  Plain and simple.  I might complain sometimes, but no more than most.  You are so far out there you can't even imagine what is really happening, can you?  Wake up, simpleton...  <br /><br />"OOC board I put up for people to have civil conversations where they can just talk and people don't have to filter through tons and tons of people like you"<br /><br />Ok.. so me having to filter through tons and tons of pointless bickering about the current newbie PK guild is better than actual, well-thought, posts?  You again prove your lack of mental worth.<br /><br />"why don't you try pointing out some good things and how to make things you don't like better.."  <br /><br />Ok, start with not judging people that post here.  Whether they be good or bad, smart or stupid...  It's not your concern if you are trying to host a haven for a public community.  If someone gives bad info, are you going to ban them?  What if they say something the wrong way?  God...  Why do I feel like I am writing this to a 2nd grader???...   lol<br /><br />"alot of people here appricate the hell I get from you and the expenses I pay out of my own pocket for this place where I get nothing but bitched at.... so you two can just for f*** yourself... "<br /><br />First off, classy finish to that paragraph, mr "we need a language filter"...<br />Secondly, you get nothing but bitched at?  As far as I know, the last time you got bitched at was the LAST time you were a moron.  While you were fixing the site, you were getting praise, not bitching.  It's a simple if - then equation...  "If you act like a stupid, spoiled child, then people will laugh at you."  Learn.  Learn quickly.<br /><br />lastly-  "I haven't asked a single person from this site to help with the expenses..."<br /><br />No.. you just mention that every single time someone doesn't play with your toy the way you want them to.<br /><br />Get over yourself, Datal... it's a WEBSITE.  Not a fuckin reason for living....  <br /><br />As for me being "fuckin stupid"?  <br /><br />..<br /><br />heh...<br /><br />Ahh.. nevermind... I think we all know the difference between you and I.  ;^)

Seeming as you don't answer any of my points, I guess I can just ignore yours.<br /><br />I won't though... ( see how nice I am? )<br /><br />Stop paying.  Let everyone here know that the site got closed down because of some stupid [censored] you did.  The people will always find somewhere else to go, and you'll still be the idiot that caused it.  We can joke around afterwords and when someone acts like a fool, then blames everyone else for it, we'll say, "He pulled a Datal".<br /><br />Or, you can just shut up, run the site, and actually fix things instead of closing down threads where your girlfriend looks like a fuckin clown.<br /><br />There are other options, too...

Knowing that you're overflowing with emotion right now, Datal, I'm going to choose to be the kind, caring and understanding fellow everyone knows me to be rather than tell you to take your sandbox and shove it up your ass.<br /><br />Ok.. Maybe not that understanding after all.<br /><br />Have you taken a moment to read the drivel you've posted? Jesus... Take a look:<br /><br /><br />"the OOC board I put up for people to have civil conversations where they can just talk and people don't have to filter through tons and tons of people like you and Nnuk always bitching about something"<br /><br />Filter through my posts?<br /><br />Excuse me, Billy -- But your OOC board was getting absolutely zero attention for several months other than an occasional LoL thread.<br /><br />People weren't coming to me asking that I start posting here again because it was too lively, ya know.<br /><br />And you actually have the nerve to complain that I've not suggested how to fix the things you've fvcked up?<br /><br />Here's one that might ring a bell:<br /><br />DON'T TRY TO BE A BOARD ADMIN BECAUSE YOU FVCKING SUCK AT IT!<br /><br />There's your goddamned suggestion.<br /><br />Christ.. This isn't rocket science and it's not an insult either -- You simply can't handle it. You banned an entire guild AND put the site in limbo all in the space of a few weeks... What more proof do you need?<br /><br />Want another suggestion? Here ya go!<br /><br />If you're actually paying $250+ a month to host this site you are getting royally screwed. AD.com takes up a shitload more space than RZ.net ever did -- And we have a rather nice unlimited bandwidth deal as well.<br /><br />Here's a third suggestion for ya...<br /><br />Quit threatening to shut down the site -- It's becoming a running gag and, quite frankly, very few people that have been around more than a few months take it seriously.<br /><br />Either do it... Or shut the fvck up about it.<br /><br />And here's the final suggestion you'll be getting from me in this post...<br /><br />... Do not even think of refering to me as "stupid" again.<br /><br />I recall you trying that with Petunia once (ironically enough.. It was on the old "flames" board) and I had to bail you out of it before your head imploded.<br /><br />The absolute last thing you need is to become my "Idiot du Jour" -- Believe me when I tell you that you're even less equiped to handle that than you were to take on Pet... Or than you are to be the moderator of an unbiased server board.<br /><br />Good day.<br /><br />Artfully Yours,<br /><br />Nnuk<br />Master of the Arts<br />www.artfuldeath.com

OK first off... never said I was shutting it down... I have alot of stuff I am planning... as for the web hosting... are you saying you transfer over 2 gigs worth of PLAIN text withen what 16 days?? I have transfered over 2 gigs of data... all plain text so far this month... This site just in the form is it in now gets a [censored] load of traffic... As for the server messing up... Yes that is due to the bugs in the PHP programing system... Not mine... And I highly doubt you use more space on your site then this... At one point before I cleaned it up I had about 500 megs of data on the site... removed about 60% of it to lower the HD space... as of right now I have over 200 megs of stuff on the server still that you all access daily... So... don't get me that junk how you have more and stuff... You don't provide a service for an entire server just a small fraction of people...

Are you crazy? you made rz.net? I know your not hat new to rz.net but come on. After Datal bought the name, what 3 or 4 years ago it stayed strong, without ever seeing your name. Or maybe I did, who knows.<br /><br />It started to die about 2 years ago, maybe a little bit less, when people started quiting EQ and getting bored of it. <br /><br />Next time I post, I'll get my thoughts together before I do =) I'm kinda busy at work at the mometn and troll these boards so I don't get to aggravated.

I just think it's funny when it's the public of the server he's trying to supply the need for, yet it is his own whims that decide what information is shown.<br /><br />Rz.net?<br />Datal.net?<br /><br />Who can tell anymore?<br /><br />And yes-  you do threaten to shut down the site plenty.<br />DO IT.  I double fudge dare ya.  =P<br /><br />"Look out... he's pulling a Datal..."     Hmm... Maybe... "Oh no!  He's going Datal!"<br /><br />I think I'll start a poll ( that will get quickly shut down. ) about which form to use with the datal term.

I'm sorry for this Datal you kow I support you but you have to admit this is funny:<br /><br />"Look out... he's pulling a Datal..." Hmm... Maybe... "Oh no! He's going Datal!"<br /><br />Lol hes going Datal, hehe made me smile.<br /><br />As for the timeline, I wasn't around for all that, I don't think. I stoped coming here after I quit EQ. And you know, or maybe you don't, Datal would of kept this site up if only a handful of people were using it. I really don't hink he cares one way or another if this place gets thousands of hits a day from a couple hundred people or if it gets 10 hits a day fom 3 people. He is doing this because he wants to and some people like coming here.

I really didn't want to get involved in any of the discussions that take place on the flame board nowadays, but since the main OOC board is dead right now, my curiousity got the better of me.<br /><br />I read this thread and I'm not going to comment on the whole Lovaelihn vs Datal war, but I do ask one little thing of you, Nnuk.<br /><br />You see, I've learned to put my past idiotic behavior behind me.  Could you please stop using me in your examples?  I do agree with you that the boards were a lot more active back when I would put the torch to anyone I felt like (and I do wonder just what happened to ole Aumvaar), but is it really that necessary?<br /><br />I'm guessing that you're probably going to answer this post with a resounding 'Hell No', but it doesn't hurt to make the request.<br /><br />-Rube

Thats what I was looking for:<br />It existed as a small message board for a dozen people -- of which you were apparently one -- with delusions of what RPing in an MMORPG is, complete ignorance of what PvP in the genre is and a habit of deleting/editing the posts of the few non-clique individuals that stumbled across it trying to make a comment<br /><br />I think this is where we aren't seeing eye to eye. I am refering to when Datal did not own the site, when I first got here. After that it stayed pretty stedy but did have its ups and downs. But when people lost intrest in EQ the site died down so maybe you did bring life back to the site. Good job =) But that is neither here nor there red my post on page 3, if you dont want to here is a clip:<br /><br />Datal would of kept this site up if only a handful of people were using it. I really don't hink he cares one way or another if this place gets thousands of hits a day from a couple hundred people or if it gets 10 hits a day fom 3 people. He is doing this because he wants to and some people like coming here. <br />

lol... it's part of a drawing I did of Arravis years ago, a bit dark for standard Arravis, but it was depicting a dark moment (death of a friend). Arravis wasn't all daisies and sunsets, the character had a profound dark streak in him which he hid quite well. A few people here have seen it though. He could be quite a bastard when he needed to be, but ussually, if he screwed you over, he manipulated the situation so the fault would not fall on him and none to few suspected it was his doing. Arravis was, above all, politically cautious, never showing his true colors. He wasn't a truly bad person, he definately had more good then bad, but there was bad. Just like all of us.

You mean that you didn't think Arravis was "dark" in a evil/shadowed way, or you didn't think he was dark, in an ebon-skinned way? lol

lol...<br />The original Arravis (for which I had done the drawing for, long before EQ) was from a pen and paper RPG game called Arcanum. He was of the Druas race, which is a drow looking race of neutral alignment. Which, really better explains his alignment then "he grew up in Erudin", hehe. Anyway, I later transferred the character to AD&amp;D, then to EQ :).<br /><br />I never thought that EQ Dark-Elves were blue though. I know from experience as an artist, that drawing ebon-black skinned peoples is damn difficult. One of the common tricks is to use blue-black, using the blues as highlights. Just an old artist's trick. I always assumed that the EQ artists sucked and tried to use this method and failed.
