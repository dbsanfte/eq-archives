Always, it startled Carezzia the first few minutes.  Being in wolf form was an overwhelming assault on every sense and nerve inside her and, even with time being so precious, the morphing process made her tremble, forcing those moments of adjustment.<br><br>Scents, everywhere, and sounds came from miles away, each one clearly distinctive of one another; vibrations of Norrath's movements in the ground beneath her paws; large steps from far away in contrast with smaller movements nearby.<br><br>And the wind.<br><br>The wind was beautiful.  She could feel it ruffle through her fur, and unlike in wood elf form, she could hear the flow of it in her ears. It was filled with colors unseen, and when she breathed it in, the strength of the many scents became magnified to such a degree, she could almost taste them upon her tongue.<br><br>Processing the multitude of incoming sensations became easier over the years, but she would never totally lose the awe she felt in those first few moments.  For that, she was grateful.<br><br>Stumbling her first steps as she tried to hurry herself, she raced from the druid portal, the wind stronger and more powerful with her speed.  Without color, yet so much more clear, the landscape was familiar enough now that she almost didn't need sight to guide the way.<br><br><br>************************************<br><br><br>The large double doors flew open, the shiny brass knobs bouncing against the walls they hit, and Baltsican ruined a whole section of the parchment he was writing upon.  Besides the line that ran across half of it from the jerk of his hand, the inkwell also startled, flowing quickly over most of what had already been written.<br><br>His first impulse was to shout and frown as he grabbed a linen left over from lunch, daubing at the ink.  He was grateful for the large blotting pad that covered the dark mahogany wood of his desk and was congratulating himself on a save well done when it registered who had brought the chaos and the state she was in.<br><br>He leaped from behind his desk, tossing the linen into a small basket and took her small hands in his own.  "Lady Carezzia, are you alright?"  After a quick perusal, he found her to be seemingly in one piece without injury and he wrapped his arms around her to hold her close to him.  "You startled me; I thought you were hurt.  Mayhap you should take a moment to catch your breath."<br><br>She did need to catch her breath, but it didn't take long.  "I have news, m'Lord, and methinks it must have something to do with your recent trip to Neriak."<br><br>"Nay!  I do not wish to hear it then!"  He guided her to a chair and gently pressed her back against it to sit when she began to protest.  "I am tired of it all!  Let us talk of other things."<br> <br>"But, 'tis MOST important!!  I......."  She glared at him when his hand covered her mouth, her dark golden eyes flaming, and she momentarily considered giving it a little bite..  Now that she was here, in all her hurry, he didn't wish to listen.<br><br>She knew him well enough to know he was almost more stubborn than she was.  Almost.  Staying silent so he would remove his hand, she almost burst with holding it in as he made his way back to his desk, settling himself in the large chair behind it.<br><br>"Let us talk of pleasant things, shall we?  What have you been practicing?" <br><br>There was more than one way to skin a cat.  She just had to figure out how to do it as effectively as the time-honored practice of simply using a knife and getting it done.<br><br>"I have been practicing concentration, much as I hate to admit it."  She gave him a frown as he laughed, remembering well the heated disagreement they had about 'practicing' to concentrate.  She had argued that you either concentrated or you didn't, and he had let her know the great error of her ways.<br><br>"How much of the forest did you destroy?"  He laughed when she tartly answered there had only been one woodland casualty, but as he settled back into his chair, she again noticed the sadness etched on his features.  It had been there since Neriak, and she wondered if he would ever be eased of the painful sadness that seemed to settle within; so deeply, it could well travel with him for life. <br><br>Not long ago, Carezzia had made <a href=http://carezzia.homestead.com/files/ORB1_Long_Journey_Home.htm>her own journey home</a> .  Mayhap it must be done by everyone, at one time or another, for different reasons and with different ending results.  It is inevitable for most people to leave what once was, and sometimes only the return to it makes obvious the changes life has wrought.  The contrast of past and present tells a truth with brutal honesty, and without words to misconstrue.<br><br>Rising quietly, without even a rustle from the snug leather armor she wore, she rounded his desk and approached his chair.  He was ready for her, having pushed back from the desk, and she settled onto his lap and into his arms, resting her cheek against his shoulder.<br><br>"I have a problem that maybe you can help me with, since I seem to be unable to solve it," Carezzia said softly, only moving enough to lightly kiss the side of his neck.  The stroking of his fingertips against her cheek was soothing and she knew he was now in 'protector' mode.<br><br>"What is it m'love?  You know I shall help you with any problem you may have," he answered as he planted a tender kiss atop her head.<br><br>She began to skin her cat.  "I am in love with a Teir'Dal, m'Lord."  <br><br>He laughed at her woeful voice and replied with much exuberance, "But that is WONDERFUL, my dear.  If you fall in love, 'tis always best to find someone of a superior race, do you not think so???"<br><br>She lifted her head to glare at him, then caught herself and snuggled onto him again.  "I shall not get into that argument again, m'Lord, but 'tis not all of my problem.  You see, this one happens to be atrociously STUBBORN and ORC HEADED."<br><br>"Please do not put the orcs down, love.  They may be stupid, but they have their uses to us." He couldn't help laughing now that he knew what she was doing, but decided he wouldn't make it any easier for her to accomplish.<br><br>"Well.....he is, nonetheless.  He stops me from speaking when I have something to say, then wants to listen when I am silent.  Do you think he may have had some head injuries during some of his past battles?"<br><br>He smiled as he shifted, and she sat up on his lap to look at him, her forearms lightly draped over his shoulders.  "Mayhap he is tired of thinking of things that bring sadness," he said.  "Mayhap he thinks of you as being his happiness in life and does not wish to associate you with anything else."  The lift of his hands dislodged her arms, and both his palms cupped her face, his thumbs rubbing the smoothness of her cheeks.<br><br>"But, m'Lord, sadness cannot always be avoided.  To be included in life is to be included into the wealth of emotions that make it up, wanted or unwanted," she answered softly, the sudden intense glow of his emerald eyes stealing her breath.<br><br>"Aye, and methinks I was the one who said that once before.  I had just thought to avoid it for a little time."  It was a whisper with which he answered, an instant before his fingers slid into her hair to pull her closer.  <br><br>His lips were warm and inviting, the taste and scent of him making her forget completely of that skinning she was attempting, and she turned more on his lap to press herself closer.  The beating of his heart was strong, and she found that comforting even as it aroused her heart into answering rapid beats of its own.<br><br>It wasn't until she heard the loud echo of boots striding down the marble hallway that Carezzia realized she was plastered to him in a most unladylike way, her small fingers running through his hair as she returned his kisses hungrily.  With a small gasp against his mouth, she pulled back from him, unsuccessfully trying to smooth unruly curls with her hands.<br><br>The relief on her face when the footsteps continued on past the door must have been evident.  He threw his head back and roared with laughter.  "M'Lady, you forget yourself!!"<br><br>"Nay, you make me forget myself!!!" Shooting a small frown at him, even as she straightened her tunic and slid from his lap, she decided it was time to finish the poor, suffering cat.<br><br>"M'Lord, there is an Assassin on the way here to….to…..well, I to do what assassins normally do."<br><br>His sigh had the force of the wind.  "Has it not occurred to you to notice the multitude of guards with which the guild house has been inundated lately?  Had you not thought I would be expecting it?"<br><br>Carezzia blinked, chagrinned.  She had not noticed, but then, it was well known she had a one-track mind, and at the moment of entering the guild house, that had not been on her mind.  Poor cat.  It had already been skinned well before she had begun the torture of it herself.<br><br>"Oh."<br><br>"'Twas nice of you to give me warning, though.  I shall let the guards know of it."  He lowered his head, dipping a new quill into a freshly opened bottle of ink, the smooth strokes of his letters being written on a nice, clean, blank parchment.  "If you would allow me a moment to finish my list, you may then accompany me to the Captain of the Guard.  I am sure he would appreciate a description of our future intruders."<br><br>Carezzia moved quietly behind his chair, wincing as one of her curls fell onto his shoulder to give away the fact she was peeking at his list.  He shot her a rueful glance, but she had seen what she needed to see before he could hide it.<br><br>"A packing list!!!  Where do you travel, m'Lord?"  No longer trying to hide her nosiness, she looked at him, ready to argue before she knew exactly what the argument would be.<br><br>He was prepared for it, having seen the spark in those large, golden elfin eyes he adored.  "I am traveling to Neriak again, m'Lady, and I am in NO mood to tussle with you about it."<br><br>"Oh.  Actually, tussling sounds fun, does it not??"  Her eyes sparkled more as she smiled impishly, and his eyes lowered to gaze at the full, rosy lips he had tasted only a few moments earlier.  "'Tis fine to make a list and to go, as long as you know I shall not be left behind."<br><br>For the second time, she heard the depth of his despair in a long sigh.  Suddenly looking weary, he answered dejectedly, a sadness radiating from his eyes.  "Aye, m'Lady.  This trip you shall not be left behind." <br>
