<font class="post">
It all started with the mice.  At the time no one thought anything about it.  One day the mice stopped scurrying around the dark corners of the large house.  Sulakek’s concubine was the one to point it out to the rest of the staff.  She had only been in his employment for a few weeks when they vanished.<br><br>She came into the kitchen in her dressing gown sleepily rubbing her eyes as the rest of the servants were preparing for the evenings meal and Sulakek's return from his daily hunt. When one of the male servants caught her eye, she batted her eyelashes and put on a terrible pout. After she requested the male remove the dead mouse from her room he nearly tumbled over his own scaly feet to do the beautiful women’s bidding.  The women of the house paid no attention to the human girl but the men would stare wantonly at her.  She was exotic to the iksars, soft and warm to the touch, unlike the iksar women with their deep cold scales.  She was not desired for breeding but ever since the pales had come to Kunark, schoolboys would fantasize about the pale women.<br><br>As the young iksar carried the small rodent to the trash he coughed.<br><br>Only in hindsight was this moment important.  No one considered the dead mice a bad omen for the Czar’s grand home.<br><br>Before the night’s meal was served much of the staff was not at their best.  Sulakek’s temper was enraged when his meal was unable to be had in peace for all the noise of sick which surrounded him.  In frustration for quiet he ordered his concubine serve him his meal alone in his room before he stormed up the grand stairwell and slammed the large door.<br><br>The pretty dark hared human girl quietly slipped into the Czar’s chamber.  With a slight motion of the Czar’s hand the skeletal guard moved out of the room and took his post outside the door quietly closing it behind him.<br><br>She climbed into his lap holding a small bowl of fresh halfling stew.  She looked small and delicate next to his large scaled body her flesh was pale next to him.  With her fingers she fed him while he read a large tome.  Noise from the rest of the house had faded.  His scaled hand petted the girl’s soft hair.<br><br>In the night he awoke, he was having trouble catching his breath.  Sitting upright in the bed he startled the girl sleeping by his side.  She sweetly smiled at him comforted his concerns and both went back to sleep.<br><br>By morning many of the servants were too ill to work.  Sulakek did not feel up to working or leaving his own chamber.<br><br>Sulakek sat in his study, pondering a tome.  He read the same passage over and over trying to understand the deep meaning behind each word.  He was not the kind of man who would allow any time to go by without his work being done.  He had such trouble focusing on the words.  His breathing was audible.  With each struggled inhale thick phlegm could be heard resisting being sucked down into his lungs.  Each exhale was more of a cough then an expulsion of air. His hand moved away from his scaled lips and wiped the spotted blood on the handkerchief lying on his desk<br><br>The day passed the house by, as they were all imprisoned with illness.  Someone in the kitchen had said it would pass.  As the day grew towards its end it seemed it had.  In sleep they seemed to cough and wheeze less.<br><br>Sulakek’s body was sore and hot.  Normally iksars enjoy heat but this was intolerable.  He tossed and turned in bed trying to sleep off the illness.  Had he been able to sweat it could have brought comfort to him.  His joints were stiff his stomach was sore from pushing the air in and out of his lungs.  The night seemed to the Czar to extend into forever, his devoted concubine served him meals and looked after his comfort.  In the night his heat was overwhelming and he sent the naked girl from his bed and back to her own chambers.<br><br>Sulakek felt relieved to have the girl in his home even if he did not feel up to partaking of her pleasures.  She quietly did for him any and everything he needed without speaking. Her walk was enough to remind him of the many things they could do once he was better. This gave him comfort, pleasure a reward worth waiting for.<br><br>In the morning the concubine stepped over the bodies of the sickened and dead servants.  Her eyes did not show shock when she saw them scattered around the house.  She collected the Czar’s meal and returned to his chamber.  With a spoon she fed him the watery soup. Being closed in his chamber he did not know his other servants were dead.  He did not know his soup was a bowl a now dead iksar had prepared for him self, the night before and the girl had removed it from his cold dead hand to feed to her master.  He ate the cold soup as the beautiful girl fed him.  That was when the Czar noticed the silence of his home. He suddenly knew it was too late to turn back.<br><br>He ordered her to fetch his parchment and quill.  His bone thin finger traced the line of her jawbone.  She was being spared; the only human in his home had not coughed even once.<br><br>Sulakek had lost weight, sitting upright to write a letter was much work for his now frail and sick body.  His human girl held him up assisting him move his body so he could write.  She fetched a large tomb and placed it in his lap, she moved his fingers around the quill with determination he forced himself to write.  The concubine watched knowing he wasted much strength and effort to pen a letter she most likely wouldn’t deliver.<br><br>He gave the letters to the concubine and bid her to deliver them to the Malificus Sect’s guildhall.  The Czar laid back upon his pillow closed his eyes.  Just then the longest moment in two days time no coughing was heard.  The Czar’s breath could suddenly no longer be heard.<br><br>The girl went to her room and collected her things, packing her dressing gown and other gifts Sulakek had given her into a single bag.  The Czar’s skeletal pet continued to stand guard near his masters chamber door.  The concubine slowly and quietly sneaked up the stairs; she smiled sweetly just before she began chanting a spell.  The skeletal pet shook its head a few times looking around the empty hall as if he did not recall walking to his guard location on his own but had just appeared there.  The human girl went back down the stairs, just before she opened the door she heard a clatter of bones falling to the floor from upstairs.  The skeleton had given up on his own life.<br><br>The concubine stood at the historic log in Nektulous; she smiled sweetly at a young enchanter.  The young teir`dal was happy he had just received some wonderful gifts for use in his craft and others nice items he would sell.  He asked the woman’s name, before she answered she had cast a spell and was creating a gate to return to her home.<br><br>Knocking on her chamber’s door awakened Oceana.  She quickly pulled her dressing gown around her and opened the large door and blinking into the light of the hall.  Xunziir looked concerned demanding to know where Oceana had been.  Oceana yawned sleepily and pointed to her desk.  She turned her back on the preacher and stumbled back to her bed.  Xunziir quietly closed the large door and moved over to the desk.  He sat at the table while Oceana curled back up in her bed pulling the blankets up around her face.  Xunziir broke the seal on the letter, his lip curled upwards in an evil grin as he read the letter from the Czar.<br>
