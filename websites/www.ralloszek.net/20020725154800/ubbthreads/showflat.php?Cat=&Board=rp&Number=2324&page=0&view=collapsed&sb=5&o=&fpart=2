The Lady Even'gel hovered over the Keeper as he gingerly inspected her pet.  If it was considered inappropriate for a menial to be alone with the lady of the house in her bedchambers, none had voiced their concerns and the visits continued daily after the dog's injuries.  In truth, there was nothing to be concerned for; the Lady Even'gel's attentions were devoted solely to her hound and the Keeper seemed to prefer the warrens to the softer comforts and finery of the main household.<br><br>The Keeper patted the beast's broad head and stood slowly.  "He'll be fine.  Every day is better and soon you can put him back on solid food.  His diet is a bigger danger to him than anything else right now."<br><br>"Oh, I have to give him his treats," tittered Even'gel, and the Keeper nodded.<br><br>"Of course.  Lady, I must take my leave now.  I've much work awaiting me below."<br><br>"Wait!"  Even'gel wrung her hands in indecision then motioned for the Keeper to sit.  "I…can I count on your discretion?"<br><br>"Certainly.  What troubles you?  Is another of your beasts ill?"<br><br>"No, nothing like that.  You must understand, I can't go to the priests and my own healers are unable to help me.  You have shown…that is, I had thought that perhaps…"<br><br>"Tell me what is wrong."<br><br>"It is my nerves.  I am so distressed.  I cannot rest.  I fear to go out.  I need…if only there were something to make me relax.  Not sleepy, you understand, just--more relaxed, more confident."<br><br>The Keeper hesitated and scratched at his beard before replying.  "I could prepare a tonic, but there would be risks, side-effects…"  His voice trailed to silence as he thought.<br><br>"Just do it!  Please!"  Even'gel clutched at the sleeve of his robe like a drowning woman to her last hope.<br><br>The Keeper stood and pulled away gently.  "Of course.  You'll have it by day's end."<br><br>***<br><br>Carezzia never made it to Lesser Feydark, not directly.  She had barely stepped from the Council chamber when she saw the flash of light in the hall again.  This time she went directly to the knothole, tracing its outline with her finger.  She came away with a sprinkling of sparkling dust and smiled as understanding dawned.  She had wondered how the fairy had been able to travel so quickly and frequently to the guildhouse.  Factoring in her knowledge of the original builders and the mystery of a missing room, she arrived at a new theory:  obviously, she was looking at a permanent gate within the hole.  But how to use it?  The small fey had no problem simply entering the opening but it made no sense that Descourge would not have some way to use it personally as well.<br><br>She placed her palm against the rough wooden planking, enjoying the texture as she thought.  Of all the druids she had ever met, Descourge placed the most emphasis on the alternate physical forms, not for their powers, like the vision of the wolf or the natural defensiveness of the tree, but for the intrinsic value of understanding which the form itself brought to the mind.  Oh a hunch, she let the change overtake her, the first change a druid is given and the most fundamental of them all:  the change into a tree.  As she become wood, she felt herself pulled through the knothole, merging with the fabric of the gate.<br><br>She found herself standing in a heavy forest, shrouded in rolling mists.  She thought of Lesser Feydark but the trees were larger, old growth sycamore and evergreens, a heavy carpet of moss and ferns growing below them.  There was a feeling of unnatural stillness, no bird or animal sounds, only the distant trickle of water sounded in a forest of grey.  The light filtering through the canopy was soft and diffuse, like moonlight.  Lacking a point of reference, she made her way toward the sounds of running water.<br><br>Walking upon a tapestry of needles and moss, Carezzia came to a small clearing.  A pool with low walls formed of stacked and mortared stones was central to it, filling most of the opening.  A smooth arch of water fountained into the air above the pool, falling back, limned in the silver glow of an unseen moon, to ripple across the pool's surface.  She settled upon the lip of the pool, the edge being the height of a low bench, and watched her reflection waving back at her.<br><br>She heard a rustle of cloth by her side and glanced to see the Princess Joleena join her at the pool.  In the context, the arrival was not surprising and neither was it unusual that the fairy appeared taller, almost the same height as the wood elf.<br><br>"I'm glad you made it," said Joleena, her voice a tender whisper above the falling water.<br><br>"Me too.  But where is here?"  Carezzia replied in the same hushed tone.<br><br>"Why, this is Dessy's room, of course.  Not quite Feydark, not quite the old worlds of the true fey, just a little spot in between--it is the place you go through when you pass between the worlds."  The fairy chuckled to herself humorlessly.  "Caught in between, that's my boy."<br><br>"So it is all related then, isn't it?  Me, Descourge, the fey, the Teir'Dal--it all ties together."<br><br>"Of course, dear.  After this many intersections, how can you even doubt?"<br><br>"I just have trouble grasping it all.  I can not see a connection, only coincidence."<br><br>"The link is buried in the past.  The advantage to immortality is time to wait for justice.  The disadvantage is that the demands of honor do not fade with time."<br><br>"But not everyone involved is immortal.  I'm not.  Des isn't."<br><br>Joleena stared hard at Carezzia before replying.  "Are you sure that he isn't?"<br><br>"He was born after the Sundering."<br><br>"Actually, he was never born…but I see this is confusing to you.  Begin at the beginning, so to speak.  What would you know from me, pet?"<br><br>Carezzia startled.  "You just called me pet.  Quildluane called me pet.  So does Descourge.  Why?"<br><br>The fairy princess smiled and trolled her fingertips in the water.  "Your father, he called both his daughters that.  Serrapoth picked up the habit and I suppose he passed it on to the rest of us."<br><br>"Wait, wait.  How did you know my father?  Who is Serrapoth?  And did you say daughters?  Plural?"<br><br>Joleena patted Carezzia's hand with her own.  "I'm going too fast.  Let us take a different tack, shall we?  I take it that you were unable to speak with my Dessy.  Do you still retain the stone I gave you in case he refused to speak with you?"<br><br>"I did.  Even after I was captured by the Teir'Dal, I kept it but something happened.  While I was captive, it shattered and things became strange.  It was like time had stopped for everyone around me and I started hearing voices in my head.  I escaped, but then there were nightmares about ancient things and streets that were rivers and…"<br><br>"Slowly," the fairy interrupted.  "Tell me exactly what happened and don't rush.  Here, we have all the time we need."<br><br>Carezzia complied, explaining what she remembered and reconstructing as best she could the things she did not.  The fairy noble was silent, attentive and encouraging, often seeming to understand what Carezzia was saying before she said it.  Only once did she interrupt.<br><br>"The voices you hear are not the fairy," Joleena interjected.  "Descourge has always heard them, as did Serrapoth before him and, I believe, does his eldest child Aluleeana."  No further explanation had been forthcoming.<br><br>Carezzia concluded with describing how she had found the knothole.  "But I was wrong.  The gateway doesn't lead to Feydark."<br><br>"It does.  As I said, this is an in-between place.  Those who pass through simply will themselves the rest of the way into Feydark.  Most times, this little pocket is empty.  <br><br>"Now, regarding the stone, much of what you've sensed and dreamt is true.  The gods and greater fey stand apart from time, viewing it as a totality in progress.  A portion of that power has remained among the Fairy Court.  What I gave to you in the form of the stone was a memory, a record of a moment from Dessy's own past which I thought would make him more pliable.  When Cazic-Thule invaded Feydark, the fairy were forced to step outside of time to survive.  With the fairy gone from the world, the metaphysics which bound the stone ceased, setting you, too, outside the flow of time.<br><br>"Obviously, the Ancient knew, if not what was happening, at least that something would happen.  That would be why the Erudian was waiting for you.  That is one of his gifts, you see.  He is where he is most needed when he is most needed and he tends to have that effect on other people around him as well.  It also means that he personally was occupied with tasks elsewhere or he would have met you himself.  It seems that the powers of divine providence and interference are hard at work around us.<br><br>"You said that after the stone shattered, you kept the shards.  Later, you had periods of lost time which the voices said were a kind of slippage and you had the nightmares of the elders beyond time.  Then it all stopped.  Do I have that correct?  There have been no further anomalies after the nightmares ceased?"<br><br>"It has only been a few days," Carezzia replied.  "But yes."<br><br>Joleena nodded.  "Then most likely, the shards attuned you to fairy sensibilities and the time issue has been resolved…Let me see your hands."<br><br>Carezzia dutifully offered them, palms up.<br><br>"Ah, there."  Joleena pointed to a trio of faint brown marks on the heal of Carezzia's right hand.  Below the surface, as though the skin had healed over them, she could just make out three slivers, the shape and color of apple seeds.  "It would seem," Joleena noted, "that you carry a bit of the old fairy within you now."<br><br>"Is that bad?  I mean, is it dangerous?"<br><br>"Not in this family.  No more than anything else we have to deal with."<br><br>"This family?"<br><br>The fairy princess shrugged.  "The definition is more functional than literal, but there is no point in denying it.  You are ideologically one of Dessy's brood, just like the rest.  Lucky me," she added cynically, "a grandmother again.  But in all fairness, the fairy have owed a debt of honor to your family for a long time now."<br><br>"Wait:  how can Descourge be your son?  He's half-elfin."<br><br>"Ah, but what is the other half?  Indeed, what is either half really?  Officially, he is adopted but I assure you, fairy blood runs in his veins and the veins of his children.  In many ways, he is more closely related to the elders than to me.  I get ahead of myself again.  I had a purpose for asking about the stone, you see.  The pool here is the Ancient's scrying pool; the water is a parallel flow to the river of time.  With the stone now part of you, there is no reason that you cannot scry into the past here just as he does.<br><br>"But," the fairy held up a warning finger," when to begin?  What to tell and what to show?  Do you know of the Teir'Dal noble T'Ere T'Enel?"<br><br>"I have heard the name.  He is the one who had me captured."<br><br>Joleena nodded.  "A bitter one, he.  And ambitious beyond his station.  When T'Ere was young and newly come into power over his house, he set his mind to a scheme of great magnitude and terrible destruction, a plan so terrible that it was an affront unto the gods themselves, even his own.  I will not speak of his goal further, only of his actions.<br><br>"He began with the kidnapping of Feir'Dal, but only the young and female, and he invested considerable energies and sums to provide for this.  He also became indebted to the Mayong for his assistance.  Even then, your father fought against him, more specifically against his agents, for Arthur did not know of the mind behind the evil nor of its full intent.  <br><br>"Then, with the assistance of the Mayong, T'Ere entered into a alliance with the brownies of Lesser Feydark and the harvesting of the fairies began.  Unlike the taking of the Feir'Dal, the fairy were taken with no regard for gender, age, or station.  Their existence was enough.<br><br>"In those days,  Serrapoth was the High Priest of the Fairy Court.  His successor, Descourge, was not yet born, though he is old enough in body to have been.  Serrapoth discerned that these events were of a singular origin and went to your father and the paladins of Tunare who served alongside him.  They entered into an honorable covenant to war against this evil and it was then that the obligation of the fey to your household began.<br><br>"Safe within Neriak, it was not possible to strike directly against T'Ere but they took captives of their own and learned much of what was transpiring.  T'Ere was horribly overextended, his resources strained, his debt to Mistmoore growing, and the other Teir'Dal noble houses were threatening to overwhelm and consume his weakened house.  The stakes were high and delicately balanced.  T'Ere was near success, a success that would place unrivaled power within his hands, but he was also threatened on all sides and fast running out of time.<br><br>"Therefore, Arthur and Serrapoth contrived a drastic action.  The paladins of Tunare and the warriors of the fairy would strike, simultaneously, at a dozen targets, destroying T'Ere's operations in all of Feydwer.  Arthur himself would lead an attack deep into Mistmoore itself to destroy T'Ere's forces there.  It would be a great loss and one from which T'Ere could recover.<br><br>"In this, they were successful, and it is a tribute to T'Ere's skill and resourcefulness that House T'Enel survived and has again risen to power in Neriak.  That was the beginning and, for some, the end.  Your father died in the effort.  I am sorry for that.  He was a good and noble man and he would have considered his own death a good exchange for their success against T'Enel."<br><br>The two women sat in silence, staring at the water, each lost within their own thoughts.  Eventually, Joleena spoke again.  "Arthur's oldest daughter was betrothed to Arthur's aide, a human and a noble man in his own right.  Shortly after Arthur's death, they were wed and moved to Freeport.  The human became one of the hallowed Sentries of Passion.  They bore a son and, though she tried, your sister, isolated in the human lands, faded."<br><br>Carezzia released a breath she had not realized she was holding.  "She was Kaolinn's mother.  My sister…"<br><br>"Is long dead and safe from T'Ere," the fairy snapped irritably.  "Age and distance kept here from T'Ere's notice.  Her husband's rank protected her from any revenge.<br><br>"Arthur's wife and other child were not so fortunate.  We failed them.  You, we were able to hide for a while but your mother…As I have said, the obligations of honor do not fade with time."  The bitterness in Joleena's voice was pronounced.<br><br>"What happened?"  Carezzia asked tentatively.<br><br>The fairy sighed and gestured across the waters of the pool.  "When you are ready, put forth your hand and see for yourself."<br><br>***<br><br>"Although I hope that my children would disagree, I have been, in my life, a very poor father.  I could make excuses and certainly there are reasons but they are only reasons and do not change the facts.  For all practical purposes, I abandoned my children to grow, in many ways, as orphaned as I was.<br><br>"Most elfs worship Tunare because it is natural and easy.  They live safe and secure on the island where they fled, guarded by dwarf and gnome, in the bosom of the forest where even the greatest evil they face, the Mayong, is still rooted in the fey.  It is eminently predictable that they would be predisposed to the gentler, female side of the pantheon.<br><br>"Half a world away, in Surefall where they send away their half-bred mistakes, such tenderness is not a luxury.  There are those who argue that I misperceive the intent of placing the elfin orphanage in Surefall.  To them I ask:  what other purpose is served by placing these potential marks upon their honor in such a remote location?  It is not that they are sent to the mainland to be reared near the human heritage.  They are sent the width of the continent away.  These children could not be sent further from Feydwer without placing them in the hands of the Erudian government.  The half-elfin children are reared closer to the Kerrans than to other elves.  Only the Iskar  are further removed from these children than the elves themselves.  Increasingly, I become incensed at this callous treatment and, as I have grown older, I have become much more vocal on the plight of the orphan.  Ironic, in light of my own parenting skills.<br><br>"Orphaned and isolated (any druidic training beyond the most basic is unavailable upon the western coast), the harsh and intuitive way of Karana, the unkempt path of the hunter, is the only option for survival.  All things in balance, I suppose, and I would not have chosen an alternative path even had I been given a choice, but my children are a different issue.  Raised as virtual orphans on the plains of Karana with no mother and an absent father, the steady string of fairy messengers I sent to watch over their physical safety were a more consistent influence on their early lives than I was.  (Our 'very quiet ghosts' we called them--these loyal fairy who carried messages and information between us during my travels and I am forever indebted to them and to my own adoptive mother who encouraged them.)<br><br>"If I gave them anything, it was a definition, a thing to stand for.  To be a member of a family is not simply to share a bloodline but to share a commitment, a loyalty, to adopt a common core ideology and a unified face to the world.  If anything, I gave them the ability to ask themselves, in the face of crisis, 'Is this what we stand for' rather than 'Is this what I want.'  To have a 'we' and to belong to something bigger than yourself is very important to the soul and to the development of a noble character.<br><br>"In the wake of such irresponsibility on my part, their decisions later in life come as no surprise to me.  The rebellious attitude of the twins (though I think becoming a bard was a bit excessive), Aluleeana's string of failed relationships with men, even Lulee's timid nature (oh my dear Lulee, perhaps not technically my youngest but always my baby, she keeps a home for us all.  Alu is too much like her father and too filled with the wanderlust)--in all of these I see the results of my own failures as a parent.  Let others look upon my own admissions and learn rather than repeat my own mistakes.<br><br>"Yet, to return to my point, in the midst of such upheaval, when life all around them was a constant struggle for survival, these orphans of mine found a better way.  They chose the gentle paths of Tunare from among the hardships of Karana and grew up to be both strong and kind.  At once, they make me ashamed and terribly proud."<br><br>--The Fairy Manuscripts, as translated by Carezzia--<br><br>***<br><br>Rene suspected he was followed from the time he left the Blind Fish.  It had not taken him long to confirm his suspicions and put the number of pursuers at six.  Their patient stalking warned him that these were professionals rather than merely opportunistic thieves.  Returned to the noble plazas of the Third Gate, he made a dangerous error:  in the unfamiliar maze of Neriak's merchant district, a connecting alley proved to be a dead-end.<br><br>Abandoning pretense, he placed his back to the alley's end and pulled free his blades, a light rapier and a short weighted dirk.  His followers remained at the street's edge until they could advance together.  They were silent, wasting no effort to engage him in dialogue and needing none among themselves, confirming Rene's fears.  In an odd way, their professionalism was a small comfort.  Even against complete ruffians, he could not hope to survive six-to-one odds.  If his assailants were sent by one of the noble houses or a related faction, however, there was a chance that the goal was kidnap and ransom rather than the more lethal alternative.<br><br>Once massed, the six Teir'Dal approached casually down the alley, their demeanor businesslike, weapons drawn.  Short blades or heavy knives settled in their hands--there would be no kidnapping.  At least, Rene thought ruefully, they had not chosen to keep him pinned in the alley and shower him with bow fire.  He would get a fight, no matter how vain.<br><br>"Can I help you gentlemen with something?" he asked perfunctorily, amused at his own words.<br><br>"We could make this easier," offered one of them cordially without slowing his approach.<br><br>"Whispering breezes, secrets swirl, abruptly ending with one last twirl."  An overly-loud, drunken singing cut through the tense silence.  Quick glances were exchanged and two of the men moved away, back down the alley towards the source of the racket.  Straining to see past intervening shoulders, Rene could discern a drunken servant stumbling around the corner.<br><br>"Hey!  It's the young Lord Rene!  I've been looking for you!" the menial shouted.  The man closest to Rene turned his head toward the sound and Rene pounced.<br><br>Rene lunged past the man, skewering his companion with the rapier.  As he passed on the forward surge, Rene swept the dirk backhanded, slashing through the distracted man's throat before he could recover.<br><br>The attack dropped two opponents in seconds but it almost killed Rene.  The weight of the sagging corpse pulled the rapier down and away; the slash left his other arm thrown wide.  Rene pitched desperately backward from a reactive slash from the third attacker, across his chest, tearing flesh and cloth, breaking hard on Rene's collarbone and ripping away through the skin of his upper arm.  Had it been a lunge rather than a cut, Rene would have been dead.<br><br>As it was, the gorge rose in his throat and his vision dimmed briefly at the pain before training and shock blocked it from his mind.  Rene half-stepped closer to his attacker, using his body as a temporary shield against the fourth man.  The rapier was still hung.  Rene released it and trapped his attacker's sword arm with his own before he could recover.  Frantically, Rene hammered the man's head with the heavy pommel of the dirk.  The two spent deadly seconds  jerking and twisting, both men slick with blood, desperate for grip and footing.  Rene turned the dirk, sawing clumsily on the other man's neck while the fourth attacker maneuvered for a clear stroke.<br><br>Wrestling, the two drove hard into an alley wall.  Blistering stars of pain danced across Rene's vision as the collision vibrated through his shoulder.  Metal clattered on stone as his attacker's blade was knocked loose by the impact.  Rene shoved him away and pistoned the dirk into his ribcage.  The man fell and Rene slumped against the wall, gasping, waiting for the killing stroke from the assailant he lacked the strength to turn to face, let alone fight.<br><br>A snapping thrum, a warm wetness splashing across him…<br><br>"Let's go," growled a very sober Keeper at Rene's side.  "If it were me, I'd have sent a follow-up squad."  Rather than respond, lost in a haze of fatigue and shock, Rene wondered if he should have recognized the Keeper's voice earlier.  They would move soon enough, right now he needed to sit down, to catch his breath…<br><br>Rene screamed as fire washed across his wound.<br><br>"Pure dwarfin whiskey, strongest alcohol in the world and I'll do it again if you don't get up."<br><br>"I can stitch you up in the Warrens.  Cut's not as bad as it could be.  Missed the tendons, only nicked the bone.  I've fixed worse."<br><br>"Just get me back to Third Gate and the priests can fix me."<br><br>The Keeper sucked his teeth loudly before replying.  "Whose House?  Any idea who sent them?"<br><br>"No," Rene admitted tiredly.<br><br>"T'Veren is my guess but it doesn't matter.  So, young Lord Rene, who do you trust?"<br><br>The alley was silent save for Rene's heavy breathing and the faint plops of a distant dripping.  "All right.  Help me down to the Warrens."<br><br>***<br><br>"Do you have to cross-stitch them?"  Rene hissed through clenched teeth.<br><br>"No."<br> <br>"How many more?" he asked when it became clear that no further explanation was forthcoming then yelped as the Keeper, literally, used his chest as a pin-cushion.  The menial used teeth and both hands to tie off before retrieving his curved needle.<br><br>"Done.  Want me to fix the shirt?"<br><br>"No, no, that's fine," Rene replied hurriedly, not convinced that the shirt would be removed from his body before more stitching occurred.  "My cloak will do until I get home."<br><br>"Good.  Strip to the waist then, I want to apply an unguent and full bandage.  I've no inclination to bring you back and cut out an infection."<br><br>Rene complied, his motions slow and gentle.  "You're left-handed," he commented as he undressed.  To his surprise, the Keeper had removed an elaborate contraption from his hand before beginning his careful surgery.  Hidden under the bandages, Rene now knew, was not a mangled hand, but an intricate bladed gauntlet, currently still wet with blood.<br><br>"I know.  Raise that arm as high as you can.  I don't want the bandage to slip.  What will you do next?"<br><br>"Go back.  If whomever is behind this was secure enough to strike within the House, they'd have done it already.  That's how my father would have done it, anyhow.  I think I can safely rule out Lady Even'gel.  I'll seek her advice."<br><br>The Keeper grunted in agreement as he wound strips of cloth around Rene's ribcage.  "You're loyal to her then?"<br><br>"Of the entire House, she's the only one who cares about me.  I think she truly does care, about me, I mean, not just for politics.  Yes, if any of them could have my loyalty, it's her."<br><br>"Good.  When you leave, you can take the first batch of her cordial up to her.  I'll finish the next and bring it up tomorrow.  That's actually why I was in the Down Under--replenishing my stocks."<br><br>"Lucky for me you were.  This cordial, it will help her?"<br><br>"Put your arms back down and I'll wrap across the shoulder.  Yes, the cordial will address her symptoms.  Warn her of its use.  It is very strong, very dangerous."<br><br>"How?  What's in it?"<br><br>"Ashroot, wormwood, empolomine, handful of other things--urge her to use it sparingly."<br><br>"If you say so."<br><br>"I do.  Listen, if this soaks through, have one of Lady Even'gel's maids change it for you.  They're not as useless as they try to look.  Take a deep breath and hold it while I pull this tight.  Good.  That should hold.  Wait a moment and I'll get the Lady's cordial."<br><br>Rene pulled his cloak over his newly bound shoulder and waited as the Keeper made his way deeper into the clutter of his workspace.  While he waited, Rene turned his attention to the Warrens outside, looking across the cavern and its contents with mild interest.<br><br>"Nice collection," he commented solicitously as the Keeper returned.  "Lots of variety."<br><br>"It's T'Ere's menagerie.  I just keep them alive.  A lot of these beasts don't fare well in captivity, worse yet underground.  They lose the desire to live.  I gather that they're quite a source of pride for his Lordship."<br><br>Rene was suddenly more interested.  "They're important to him then?"<br><br>"Indeed.  Some more than much of the House itself, I'd venture.  The Feir'Dal, for example, is almost an obsession for him.  He visits near daily to see it."<br><br>"A light elf as a pet?  I'd love to see him."<br><br>"Her."<br><br>Rene nodded, looking away to try to hide the excitement on his face.  Innocently enough, the Keeper might have given him the weapon he sought against T'Ere.  "I'm a bit lost.  You can show me the way back?"<br><br>"Of course."  Pressing a silver flask into Rene's hands, the Keeper motioned with his head for Rene to follow.  "That's the Feir'Dal's nest there.  Don't disturb her; I've quite a bit of trouble getting her to sleep.  If you follow that passage there and stay to the left, you should reach the Third Gate without incident."<br><br>Rene nodded and walked several steps down the passage before pausing.  "And you?" he said, turning to look back at the Keeper, "Who are you loyal to, Keeper?"<br><br>"Why, Lord Rene, these lowly creatures are my only concern.  I've no ambitions beyond their well-being."<br><br>Rene laughed and walked away down the passage.<br><br>"I couldn't help but notice," chirped a voice behind the Keeper, "that the tunnel you sent him down is not the one I usually see used.  Could it be you have repaired him only to send him into a danger of your own making?"<br><br>The Keeper clucked his tongue.  "You are too suspicious, dear Kathrin.  He will reach home whole and hale."  He walked past the Feir'Dal who was still curled on her side as if sleeping.  "I merely feel some family secrets have been kept too long."<br><br>
