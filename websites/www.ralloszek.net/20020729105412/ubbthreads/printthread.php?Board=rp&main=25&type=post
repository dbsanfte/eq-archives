Tiny tendrils of smoke wafted from the edges of the lush green leaf as it began to heat, followed by a darkening that crept upward to engulf it.  Almost completely shriveled by the time actual flame could be seen lapping at the remains, it broke from the stem that attached it to the tree, the flame dousing in the air by the time the wrinkled black leaf fluttered to the ground.<br><br>Carezzia peered down from her perch high in the tree with a satisfied smile etched upon face, though it felt foreign to smile with all the frowning she had been doing.  When she began her efforts only a few days ago, her first attempt had almost burned a whole tree to cinders and it was probably still smoking, even now.<br><br>Control and patience had been denied her upon birth, and at her level of training, she greatly needed it now more than ever.  Today, however, she began to truly believe effort would make up for that which genetics had robbed her.   Over the last few days, she proved concentration could make up for a world of defects.<br><br>Of course, had practicing concentration been her own suggestion, she would have tried it earlier, and mayhap accepted the idea more readily.  As it was, she only persevered with it as a last resort. <br><br>Deciding she deserved a break, she leaned her back against the trunk of the tree, the thick branch holding her lithe weight barely swaying with her movement.  It was an overly warm afternoon, and the flask she opened brought the relief of cool, thirst-quenching water.  'Twas a good day to be a wood elf in the top of a tree.<br><br>Over the past few days, warmth in the Commonlands had brought quite a few visitors beneath the inviting shade of her tree.  It was just over a small hill from a well-traveled path and there were many who stopped to do just she was now; resting and partaking of water.  She would stay hidden in the top of the tree, forcibly making herself resist the urge to play jests upon those below.  She sternly reminded herself she was studying, and it would not be a good idea to start anything that would either interrupt her or get her into trouble.<br><br>She had heard quite a few conversations, from the idle chatting of gossiping women, to talk of battles between men, to the overly amorous affections of an ogre and ogress.  From the heated words she heard, she gathered the ogre couple were recently married and traveling to a new city.  They were very obviously infatuated with one another.  Though Carezzia most certainly had a curious nature, that was something even she didn't want to witness and with a few discreet droppings of broken leafy branches, she aggravated them enough to make them seek a more appropriate spot for what they had in mind.<br><br>This time, her jubilant mood and the elation of her success gave her permission to eavesdrop as she heard sounds below her.  She would spend a little time listening, then mayhap intertwine a jest that fit with the conversation.  Nice secrets could be learned and used if one listened closely enough, such as a fear of snakes, spiders or rats. <br><br>"Me'z hungree, Ladee." The coarseness of a troll's demanding voice drifted up to Carezzia and she froze, the flask lifted to her lips for another drink.  Mayhap it wasn't such a good day to be a wood elf in a tree after all, not with a troll beneath her, and a hungry one at that.<br><br>"Shut UP, you fool.  I am tired of your complaining!"  That voice was sharp and feminine, the voice of a shrew, but obviously not one of a gutteral and hard to understand troll.  Carezzia didn't dare move much, but she turned her head to peek down through the leaves, catching a swatch of deep blue skin and a shock of white hair, and knew the female was Teir'Dal.  Carezzia hoped the 'Ladee' packed food for the troll, so he would not begin hunting for it.  <br><br>She knew many times trolls served as escorts and protectors for highborn Teir'Dal, so she was not surprised to see the combination of troll and dark elf together.  Normally, the troll deferred to the Teir'Dal, so she WAS surprised at this one's brazen aggravation with the Lady.<br><br>"You idiot!" the Lady shouted.  "We have only a short time to finish this job and you WILL NOT ruin this for me.  I haven't located the guild house of the Covenant of the Wolf, and that may yet take a few days!  Your fat stomach is something for which I DO NOT have time to worry!"<br><br>The troll was stubbornly holding out for his stomach.  "Yuz meen tu me! Me no barsh gud if mez hungree!! Me say NO when yuz askz me fer help!!!"" He unsheathed a huge sword from its scabbard, swung it in the air and stabbed it into the ground in defiance.<br><br>The Teir'Dal took a threatening step toward him, her fist raised.  "Feed, worm," she hissed, "but if you botch this for me, you will die a slow, painful death, at my hand.  Remember that!!"  She didn't look away from him as she raised her other hand, an eruption of red shooting out from her palm to drag in a struggling young kodiak that had been creeping by in the distance.<br><br>The troll was upon it in a flash, with an agility surprising for one so large.  Her nose wrinkling in disgust, the Teir'Dal turned away, but not before she saw blood spurting over his face and torso from the first limb he tore from the screaming animal.  Snorts and growls, mixed with sounds of the large animal's prolonged death, tearing flesh, and loud gulping swallows filled the air as he fed hungrily.  She wanted to press her hands to her ears, but she would not let him know it bothered her, though it was the lack of manners in his feeding that bothered her, and not the form of the feeding itself.<br><br>Her lips thinned, pressed tightly together as she walked to the edge of the shade the tree granted.  She was intent on one thing, and one thing only; her mission.  Waiting impatiently, pacing until he finished feeding, she swung back to him when she heard him rise clumsily from the ground, her mood not improved.<br><br>Her eyes ran over him in disgust, noticing the blood and bits of flesh on his face and chestplate.  "You WILL be bathing at the next river we cross.  I will not travel with a pig such as you are now."<br><br>He grunted in a satisfied way, wiping his big warty hand over his mouth before giving her a nod.  Grasping his sword hilt, he yanked it from the ground and sheathed it.  Now that his stomach was not rumbling, he waited patiently for her.<br><br>She had not eaten, nor quenched her thirst, but the Teir'Dal did not seem to notice.  Speaking more to herself than to him, she said, "A few days to find the guild house, then a few days to find Baltiscan himself, if he is away.  With luck, he will be there awaiting."  Sounding as though she was choking, she repeated his name.  "Baltiscan.  He will be dead before he sees me.  I am the finest Assassin in all of Neriak."<br><br>She turned her head, her chin lifted haughtily as she smoothed her black robe.  "Come, oaf," she spat before she headed in the direction of the path.<br><br>Carezzia stayed silent for long moments after she heard the troll lumber away.  Her pointed ears had perked up when she had first heard the guild house of the Covenant of the Wolf mentioned, knowing well herself where it was located.  In fact, she made <a href=http://carezzia.homestead.com/files/COW.htm>a little visit</a> not long ago, though she had been angry that day and did a some damage.  She had paid for it, in an odd way, but still felt as though she would be welcome if she showed up there unexpectedly.<br><br>When she heard the target's name, a jolt had hit her with such force she almost fell from the tree.  Baltiscan.  Who would hire an assassin to kill him?  Someone had to have paid well to employ the services of a caster as an assassin, who normally felt they were above jobs that were best left to the stealth of rogues.  Money and purpose; whoever it was had not been willing to chance a failure, making sure to add strong magic to the mix.<br><br>Even knowing she would reach the guild house of The Covenant of the Wolf well before the assassin, panic still gripped her; she must warn him as quickly as possible.  After scrambling down the tree, she pressed her hand to her stomach to stifle the bout of sudden illness she felt when she caught a glimpse of cast away bloody kodiak parts and was overwhelmed by the smell of fresh blood.  But only for a moment; the next instant, she lifted her hands, casting as quickly as a portal could be opened, and stepped through it.  Nothing was left of her, not even her scent, when the portal closed.<br>
