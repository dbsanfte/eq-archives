1.  I agree... there is more of a learning curve than some people realize.  As for your suggestion, that is actually something we are considering.  The other side of the argument is this.  If you have a Level 30 character in Shadowbane and feel like you messed it up... it isn't that hard to reroll it due to the leveling curve not being that bad.  Granted, if you try to do the same thing with a Level 30 character in other games you may just cry... <img src="/ubbthreads/images/graemlins/smile.gif" alt="" /><br /><br />2.  They are being worked on.  We have a new version coming up soon with more balancing issues addressed.  I know Pets are on that list.<br /><br />3.  True, especially at the higher levels.  As I stated earlier, Shadowbane is more of a player interaction game than PvE.  Now, I know it's harder currently at the lower levels too but that is more due to there not being enough low level spawns rather than them being too hard (and BaF (Bring a Friend code) which is being tuned down for lower level Mobiles) but that is being adjusted in this next patch, too.<br /><br />And "Ashen" has been here for a while... just not as "Ashen" <img src="/ubbthreads/images/graemlins/smile.gif" alt="" />  Use to play on RZ a long time ago... in the Elven Guard and a short-time member of the Blood Coven.
