I agree with all of you, wow, whou would have thought we would all agree on something.<br /><br />And Wynona Rider is definately a babe, and I agree with the verdict.  We'll see about her sentecing, I don't think she needs jail time, A fine, community service is fine with me.  What I  <font color="red"> DO </font color> wish would happen was that everyone who broke the law was charged with the enthusiasm the prosecuters had against her.  Was she put in the spotlight because she was a star, hell yes. Did she deserver to be, no not really.  She didn't do anything a "normal" citizen could not have or even HAS done.  So I feel the punishment she gets should be the same as I would get.  BUT I think they reason they prosecuted her like they did was similar to a thought one of you said, I forget who, but about the politicians, just because they are famous, and make big money, should they really get that kind of special treatment? I do not think so.
