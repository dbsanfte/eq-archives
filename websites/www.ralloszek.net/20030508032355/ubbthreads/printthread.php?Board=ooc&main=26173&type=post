Don't have any care for being tactful. I've watched you make barbed insults about my guild numerous times and I have remained silent only because I thought perhaps you weren't intentionally being rude. But if you're gonna talk the trash, at least be resigned to defending yourself when someone brings it back to you. It's not that I don't want to be a diplomatic person -- its simply that I feel I have been long enough. I responded mainly to your barbed jab (as usual) to my guild. I don't really care whether the the mass thinks PKing is dead or not. I've been diplomatic with you for a long time, and I grow tired of your small-minded insults, and despite your belief, I am not "furiously whacking my keyboard" while I'm typing here. Trust me, after I posted I felt bad about being so rude, but that doesn't mean what I said I don't agree with 100%.<br /><br />You're right. Impact would depend on how I define it. If you look at guild KOS lists -- lets take MiM for example. You'll see "Lucid Vision KOS" -- not FoH, or AD or any other PK guild, but LV. Now, why do you think that is? It's because we were the only PK guild in their range. I'd rather affect the top 10 guilds (as far as PvE and levels/gear goes) then 100 low level guilds. Maybe we can agree to disagree here, but I still contend that PKing in the higher levels is not only harder, but it yeilds more kill satisfaction and high-end gear than newbie_slaying010. So whether or not you dispute us being "bluebies that want gear" -- the fact is, as a contingent, we were the most heavy hitting PK guild, although, for their time, I still think DB still holds seat one. I think Drakkyn called that arrogance; me? I just call it a fact.<br /><br />And I wouldn't call our PK range narrow. Anyone that intended to level to their characters full potential was in my range. Just like most LV. You for example. I think you were 54 or 55. You had 8 levels to PvP the player base. I also had 8 levels to PvP the player base. Only difference between you and I is its harder for me to score kills. IE: More challenging. Just like the rest of us. But we still did it, and fairly well.<br /><br />Is there anyone that hasn't uttered the phrase "GAH u fukkin foh assholes suck!!!"? Well, yea. I never did. Mangar never did. Shoon never did, or Darkahn, or Lairans, or Laroux, or Arakan, or Psycholistic or.. yea, the list goes on. But seriously, unless you're a level 20 chilling in the newbie sandbox, you didn't deal with FoH. Not because you scampered to get out of their level range! But because if you wanted to evolve with your character, you simply leveled. FoH -- and I'm not trying to be offensive here -- didn't mean anything to me, or anyone else higher than level.. what? 20 or 30? You tell me. I ran into them a few times on my wizard twink and corpse camped one of their wizards for like 30 minutes before, though. Who would talk about us? Um.. only the entire high end player base. You have to remember, not only do I not know crap about the lowbies that populated the server, I have no idea who "Legions of Legends" are, either. This is the major difference between you and someone thats higher level. It's not arrogant that I don't know who you're refering to, its simply that these people had absolutely no effect on my EQ life, consequently -- I don't know who they are.<br /><br />Frankly, I don't care how many "Welcome back!" tells you get. I obviously didn't play the same way you did. I was always more interested in duels and actual killshots of people I didn't like then people being giddy at my very presence, but its not actually so different. Even though I'm a PK, I always represented myself as someone with integrity, which I'm sure other people can attest for. You have a similiar reputation, but honestly, do you think people were more wary about fighting Shoon, or you? I'm just making loose examples here.<br /><br />Thats great that you have a nostalgic 65 shaman in AD that shoots the hay with you about how fun it was when he was a newbie fighting you. Me on the other hand, I've dueled those people. I've killed many of them. I'm not sure what point you're trying to make. Wait-- I think I get it. You're trying to say that because some AD guys actually remembers his scoffles with you an eon ago, that somehow makes you more of an impact than lets say.. me, who has numerous kill shots of those people? (chuckle) Okay, how many peeps under level 50 even have the faintest notion of who I am -- gee, I don't know but I'm inclined to say, "Gee, I don't care." If I wanted the lower level base to give a [censored] about me I'd have played my character as a lowbie, but I was more interested in killing the toughest people on the server. What kind of a silly point are you trying to make with that argument? I mean, c'mon!<br /><br />You're wrong again about TUS. Mangar turned down their offer and told them when they come on LV raids -- they adhere to LV rules. And we *DID* absorb all of HiV that still actively played. Thats a fact. We were content to do our own thing -- didn't make a difference to us one way or the other. And when you say "We were going to grant you access" do you mean to tell me that you were apart of a raid guild that was designed to get bluebie_loot? Our dealings with TUS were very minimal at best at any rate. I remember going to 2 TUS things to get a feel for those people and heal them because their highest cleric was 49. Mangar also helped them. We had nothing to benefit from helping those people besides gaining political allies and potential new LV material. Most of those people were green.<br /><br />Like I said, we had been PKing for months before we even bumped into TUS. I don't see any other reason disputing these facts with you as I only saw you in game several times anyway and I'm sure your memory is somewhat hazy.<br /><br />It always comes back to Everfrost with you, doesn't it? Look, I can't express how much I simply do not care about your nostalgic days of kicking around in the snow at Everfrost. I'm inclined to say, "Who really gives a crap?" So you were a wizard that could (/gasp) kill newbies. That is absolutely shocking and frankly, I think the local media should be contacted immediately and get in touch w/ CNN to give you the appropriate attention that you so rightly deserve. News flash -- I was a PK on Vasten till level 44. I was in Darkenbane at level 20 and I aquired many shots in that time. I died once as I leveled and started at 1. 44 to 49 LV was at war with Begotten and I periodically played Nenlain and killed tB. Few months later LV decided to go PK.<br /><br />"So if ya don't like it.. Don't read it."<br /><br />It's not that I don't like what you're saying, its simply that what you're saying isn't accurate and I feel the need to clarify for you because -- like it or not -- you don't have a clue what you're talking about.<br />
