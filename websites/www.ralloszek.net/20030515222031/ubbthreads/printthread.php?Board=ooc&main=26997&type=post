.. what is it good for? lol~<br /><br />I'm not the kind of person to talk much politics. I don't really think most people would like hearing my <i>honest </i> view on politics. Who would want to hear how, in my opinion, the only reason why capitalism ( and therein the United States ) seems to be working is simply because it takes one of mankind's most dreaded traits into account? See, I am not an idealist to the point to which I am blind to the world. I know what it means to be a 'democracy'. My opinion counts so long as it melds well with the socially acceptable norm. Otherwise, I might as well keep most thoughts to myself. <br /><br />I am, at heart, a pacifist. I don't really think that fighting solves anything. I do know that sitting by idly while someone else hurts people is wrong, too... and being a pacifist does no good at that point. Yeah, we can all talk big about how we don't want to hurt a fly and all that, but when it comes down to it, any one of us should be ready and willing to kill another person - if the stakes are high enough. Case in point - someone is holding your child hostage.... What parent <i>wouldn't</i> kill?<br /><br />Anyways...<br /><br />So, yeah... I don't talk much politics. I just did, though, sorta.<br /><br />So, people that are much braver than myself are putting their lives on the line to save a nation in distress. We've done this several times and the average person simply watches the news briefs in contempt, wishing that they would show the highlights from last night's game instead. We're a decadent culture, although we tend to not see it for what it's worth. Hell... by our own government's definition, I am living in poverty. I still am afforded the ability to gorge myself on exotic foods from any corner of the world 24 hours a day, the simple pleasure of turning on my television to see pretty much anything I would want to see at any hour, and the wonderful intoxication of spreading my thoughts on paper like they matter. I think of the people living in these other countries starving. These people don't worry about cavities... no concern about their complexion... Mental health is a punchline to a joke that most of them are so uneducated that they probably would have been lost on 'a guy walks into a bar'.... and I complain. lol~<br /><br />I think it was Hemmingway that wrote something similar to "So long as I am free to think what I will, what matter is it to me what government I live under?" I might be wrong, though... I'm not exactly 'educated' by the norm's definition. <br /><br />It's all a matter of perspective, I guess.<br /><br />
