There is a slight creak from the aged bow as its string is pulled back. The wood moans in extasy from the ranger's firm pull, and the arrow's head is raised towards its mark. Seconds pass before there is a thwack, and the arrows is let loose to flight, slamming hard into the message board with a dull thud. The force of the hit shakes loose the wax seal binding a roll of paper to the shaft of the arrow, and the paper billows in the cold night air, overlapping and obscuring all of the other postings. The archer, his acute vision unhindered by the darkness, saw this and a grin tears across his grim and some what aged face, and his green eyes shine. He pulls back the hood of his cloak and shakes his head for a moment, scratching his head, letting out a sigh. "Alright," he mutters under his breath, "lets see her cover this up." He slings his bow across his back, and adjusted his quiver, running his hand through his hair quickly once more before covering his head once more in the cowel, obscuring his features. He steps backwards and slowly sinks into the night, camoflaged in shadows, walking away from civilazation towards the trees on the horizen.<br><br>The Continued Adventures of Kelleher Ivyelm: Chapter 2<br>"One mighty fine bow"<br>         The cave walls shook as the battle raged in Kael Drakkel. The small legion, dwarfed by the massive scale of their surroundings, braced themselves for another wave of attack as the sound of giant feet came thudding down the long corridor. They slunk back into the shadows as the monk came running in from around a corner, being chased by two of the massive Frost Giant sentries. Not seeing the assembled combatants, they did not make an uproar or alert their bretheren, and slowly they were surrounded. The monk adoitly slipped and feigned death from the fall, halting the giants dead in their path. Their deep low voiced murmured in confusion, and one picked up the monk by the leg with his massive forefingers. Shrugging, he examined the monk, checking for any signs of life. It was at that time that the spears slid out from the shaddows and the group advanced, hurling their long wepons through the giants middles from the ground. While some were deflected by the giant's thick scaled armor some went through, pinning the giants in their spot. Roaring, the leaned down and swipped the spears away, the shafts broken and sticking out from their middles. Our protagonist, Kelleher Ivyelm, the jovial and sometimes inebriated ranger, was flung against the cave wall with a crack. The ranger winced from the sound and felt his back, realising his bow had broken. He uttered an obscanity, heaved up his long shafted Wurmslayer and charged back into the fray, the swords of his compatriots hacking violently at the giants, the tallest of them only reaching the knee caps of their foes. He lept up and stabbed the long blade into the giant's gut, and held on, his feet dangling in midair. Using one hand, he reached down and grabbed his shorter sword and hacked into the giants flesh rappidly, while still hanging on for dear life. The giant, realising the fight was leaving his favor (for his fellow had fallen hard to the ground, dead and cold as the velium wepons his people carried) turn and ran from the fray to alert his fellows, the hapless ranger still hanging on for dear life, hacking into the giants gut. With one more swift jab the ranger's wepon lit to life with magical power and shards of velium tore from the blade and into the giant's flesh, sending a cascade of bile, intestines and blood onto the ground. The ranger shook his wurmslayer free and fell on the ground, showered in entrails. The ranger's movement was hindered by the sleek bodily fluids coating the ground, but quickly he ran from the falling giant, with a mighty, wet thud, barely escaping the crushing death. He wiped his bloody brown locks from his face and licked the iron rich liquid from his face and started running back to the other members of the raid group, who were enguaging another giant, a bit better dressed than his fellows. The ranger spat, and cursed, "A noble." He lept up and threw himself over the shorter halfling fighters and heaved into the giant's shin. The massive mountin of a man was not moved, and he proceeded to begin evoking his magics. With a musical whir, a thick updraft lifted the fighters in the air, hurling them towards the spiked ceilings. Kelleher hit the ceiling hard, his middle being cleaved by a sharp stalagtite, the force of the giants spell cutting though flesh, bone and armor. He grimaced and yelled in pain, as he slowly slid down off of the stalagtite, his vision clouding around the edges, seeing the other fighters sprawled across the floor. He violently hacked blood up and bile, spilling from ruptured organs, the surging of his body making his gaping wound gape even more. His wepons slid from his hands and clanked against the arms. He slid free of the stalagtite and landed on a dead giant, his fall slightly padded. Being damned near torn in half, the ranger slowly eaked out his last struggling words, reaching towards his wepons a few feet away, and watching as one by one, the giant picked up his compatriots and ripped their heads from their necks in it's gaping maw, its hard teeth grinding brain and bone to a pulp and spitting it to the ground, letting the body fall like a candy wrapper. The ranger heaved in heavily and forced out a healing spell, shoring up some of the wound, rejuvinating the flesh. He rolled over and casted again, the blue sparkles dancing across his body and reflecting in the sticky shiney blood coating much of his armor. He slid off the giant and got to his feet, stumbling somewhat and looking around. He saw that the giant he had landed on had held a bow, a massive one, intractely carved on a dark cherry wood. It's color was a reddish brown, dyed seemingly from blood, two massive bearded heads carved in holding the bowstring in place. In the giants hands it was massive, but as his small hands reached out to grasp it, it shrank to his appropriate size, and he was amazed at the power and light weight of the bow. It felt cold, like ice, and smooth. Dangerous. He slowly reached across his back and grabbed an arrow, and mounted it on the bow. He climbed onto the giants gut, and pulled back, holding the bowstring close to his cheek and taking aim square at the giant's chest. The giant saw this and started charging towards the ranger, making his last stand. The ranger exhaled and released the bow, the string brushing against his cheek and the arrow speeding through the air, seemingly pulling all of the cold from it and focusing on it's head, and slaming into the giants chest, letting loose a ripple of blue ice and forcing him into convulsions, before he turned on his heels and fell to the ground. As the other combatants got to their feet, the ranger slowly let the bow down, and ran his hand over it, his fingers glidding across the intracate carvings. He knew the bow was mighty, and respectuflly, he slung it across his back. He forced another heal out of himself and he stubled away from the others. He felt around his belt for his trusty bottle of beer and took a swig, trying to get the taste of blood from his mouth. He sighed, the wind from the Eastern Wastes buffeting his face. He staggered out into the snow muttering under his breath, "This is one mighty fine bow." and making his way towards Thurgadin, and it's many bars.<br><br>Kelleher Ivyelm<br>45th Level Half Elven Ranger<br>The Archer of Rallos
