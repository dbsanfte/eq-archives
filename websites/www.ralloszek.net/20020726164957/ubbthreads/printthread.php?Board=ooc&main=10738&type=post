... But, in our case, online presence depends on various factors.<br /><br />Take now, for example...<br /><br />Our younger members have busy preparing for school exams (or getting hammered). Those employed in the retail trade had been putting in mad hours due to Mother's Day (second only to Xmas). And some of us -- not mentioning any names ;-) -- have to spend HUGE amounts of time processing portraits and putting up galleries to enlighten the masses rather than in game sketching them.<br /><br />Add to this the fact that it's spring and those of us that have been burried in snow for the past several months might like to go outside on occasion and it's plain to see how our EQ presence is gonna be cut down periodically -- <i>Especially</i> when our gaming time is split among other games as well.<br /><br />/chuckles<br /><br />I should save this as my "spring speech" -- I seem to make it every year! ;-)<br /><br />Artfully Yours,<br /><br />Nnuk<br />Master of the Arts<br /><a target="_blank" href=http://www.artfuldeath.com>Artful Death Gallery</a><br /><br />PS I'm sure someone else will comment on this (cough Ord cough) but the individual that refered to DB as being "classy" doesn't know wtf he/she is talking about.<br /><br />To clarify.. 5-10 "classy" members surrounded by 100 incompetent, smack talking, exploiting, naked/newbie tunic wearing, portal ganking, coattail riding fuckwits does not a class act make -- It just means that 5-10 people were in the wrong guild.
