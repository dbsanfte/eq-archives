Goddamn,everything you said there was a lie.I don't give a fuck really,you can say whatever you want here,but we both know the truth.I've killed enough people that I can tell when someone was buffed.Only reason I made that big post was because of as soon as we was done with the fight,he just started lying and lying.He and I both know that everything I stated in that post was absolutely true,it doesn't matter at all wether anyone else believes it.I don't have time to sit in the bazaar and beg buffs.Believe me,after fighting me he knows damn well he needed those buffs and heals.I ported into felwithe,and grimance was sitting there on the ground.I don't require anyone to believe me either.If grimance hadnt been right there,he wouldn't have made it in time.And sure,50 percent of people wouldn't even dream of logging on their lowbie without some kinda major buffing,we've all seen it.I'm not crying,because there is nothing to cry about,I didn't die.I just went there thinking it was a fair fight.Instead he has grimance there in tow,which if you read back far enough,I predicted he would be there,long before fight went down.The only thing about whole deal that set me off was just the plethora of lies he hit me with after the fight.He said he wasn't buffed,I was.LIE.He said I had the pks help me.LIE.It just goes on and on.I couldn't believe it.It was just a simple fight that really wouldn't count for much in ANYONES eyes,and he goes and carries on like he just ninja looted Ascending Dawn,and is on damage control extreme.Its laughable.Hahahaha &lt;-------------See?<br /><br />Fuck you Grimance.
