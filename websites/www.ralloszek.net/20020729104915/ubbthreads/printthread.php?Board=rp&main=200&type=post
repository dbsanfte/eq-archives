Baltiscan had been nervously pacing the floor of his study for well over an hour now, his steel shod boots echoing in the large room at his guild house.<br><br>He had awakened early this morn, before the beams of sunlight kissed the mountaintops, and had finished his guild duties early so he could practice with his mace near the clear blue lake.  After three long hours of sparring, his muscles ached, and sweat streamed over his ebon blue forehead, soaking his long ashen hair, but he still felt apprehensive.  The exertions of his hard workout did not wash away his tension, and when he returned to his study to ponder his situation, he didn't even bother to remove his silvery armor.  Too distracted, he didn't seem to notice his heavy boots scarring a trail across the wooden floor.<br><br>Only the sound of his pacing, metal against wood, reverberated through the room to keep him company.  He was tired; there was no denying that, as evidenced by the dark discolorations under his eyes.  But he was wide-awake, his mind unable to rest, and running through his head were the events that had transpired in the past few weeks.<br><br>His thoughts drift back to Lady Carezzia, who was a central part of those events.  When he had least expected it, when he was ready to take another sabbatical, he had found her.  They first met in the Crystal Caverns, where they had banded together to slay Queen Dracnia.  He had remarked to himself on how different she was from the coldly beautiful Teir'Dal that his parents betrothed him to; Carezzia was full of life and energy, always there to lift one's spirits. And as he grew to know her, he found out there was more to the flighty, carefree druidess than what he first thought. She gave him a reason to stay, to seek new challenges, and most importantly, to love.  She was also the reason he made a recent journey back to his home in Neriak.<br><br>Baltiscan had wished to confront his father about his new life, but most especially about her.  Sure, she was a wood elf, and she even worshipped Tunare, but they both had one thing in common -- honor.  He had been taught that honor was above all else, so how could he hate someone who conducted herself with grace and respect, no matter what race she happened to be?<br><br>Baltiscan tried to explain that he still worshipped Innoruuk; the Father was the only God to which he would ever bow down to, but he would revere Hate in his own way.  It seemed to Baltiscan that the Father had not forsaken him yet; he had retained his Shadow Knight abilities.  He still went into every battle with his skill and knowledge in one hand, and Hate in the other.  There were very few times either had failed him.<br><br>His earthly father would hear none of that. He was an old soldier who came from the old ways of learning, which was to follow the Priests of Innoruuk or be damned.  With his mother cowering in the background, they screamed at each other for hours, both men too stubborn to budge even a single inch.  In a fit of fiery rage, Baltiscan's father had flung open the doors to their manor, screaming wildly for the guards to arrest his own treacherous son.<br><br>Dodging the Indigo Brotherhood, Baltiscan had to flee, hiding in the dark alleyways of Neriak until someone could extract him.  He managed to elude the guards and escape the city, thanks in large part to Lady Carezzia, whose insistence had forced his friend Deith to guide her into the heart of Neriak to find him.  In the beginning, she had been petrified at seeing the pure depravity of the city of which she had only heard stories.  But, she had the strength and resolve to continue, willing herself to find him at all costs. The loud din of the search had informed her that he was in the Third Gate and she made her way there, tracking him atop the walled parapets surrounding the inner city, his battered body bruised and bloodied from fights with his own kin.  The loud cry of the guards signaled they were nearing the two of them, and with him clinging weakly to her, Carezzia had whisked them away to safety in the winds of a portal.<br><br>Though his death would have been horrible had he been captured, hers would have been the stuff of which legends are made.  At the least, she could have expected a slow torturous ending at the hands of the Priests, and Baltiscan did not even wish to contemplate the alternatives.  He loved her because she was willing to risk all that for him, though her bravery in rescuing him was not the only reason she held his heart.<br><br>Lady Carezzia was not there to comfort him at the moment; she was out in the Commonlands training, and he did not expect her for another few hours. Thoughts of her absence snapped Baltiscan's attention back to his troubles. He was sure his name would be stricken from the Tome of Innoruuk; no knight was allowed to pollute the purity of the Teir'Dal line by marrying an inferior race.  Just as surely, he would not be allowed to return to Neriak; the Indigo Brotherhood would see to that.  He would miss his old home and his life-long comrades from his knightly order, but most of all, he would miss his mother.<br><br>Though he expected some type of angry reception from his father, he had hoped to at least be given leave to say his good byes to his mother.  She was a waif of a woman, her frail body seemingly unable to have the strength to hold her steady, but she was the glue that held their family together. She was the one who was always there to deflect his father's fiery anger. His father was stern and his punishments were even sterner, but his mother was always there to comfort him.  Though his father wished for Baltiscan to follow in his footsteps to become an officer in the dark armies, it was his mother who showed him the little tricks of necromancers, sparking his interest in the combination of magic and the sword that the knighthood offered.  She doted on him and Baltiscan adored her.<br><br>"I have lost my titles and my family," he mused aloud.  "I am a knight without a liege and a son without a family.  Mayhap there is something I can do to change at least a small portion of that."  Now, his mind firmly resolved on his actions, he began undoing the straps that held his dragon-etched armor onto his body, the large protective breastplate clanging on the wooden floors as it drops.  After wiping the sweat of exercise off and changing into more comfortable leather leggings and a silken tunic, he strides to his large mahogany desk, plopping himself down on his chair and plucking a piece of parchment and a plumed quill to begin writing.  He needed a few supplies, and he found a list was always useful.<br><br>Innoruuk and his father be damned.  He would plan a way to return to Neriak to speak to his mother one last time.
