Cleric Alternate Abilities
<br />
Version 5 (October 9th, 2003)
<br />

<br />
 
<br />
This guide is an attempt to describe, in many details, Alternate Abilities that become available to clerics once they reach level 51.  Most of the information provided here comes from the EQCleric forum and the Castersrealm site, and I've tried to verify it as much as I could.  While there can still be errors, and explanations on some abilities remain vague, I have tried to be as comprehensive and accurate as possible.  I hope you will enjoy reading this guide.  Unfortunately, English is not my primary language so I hope you will forgive my spelling and grammar mistakes too!
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
	B. Ranks
<br />
	C. Activated abilities
<br />
	D. Titles
<br />

<br />
II. Abilities
<br />
	A. Generic description
<br />
	B. Alphabetic list of abilities
<br />

<br />
I. GENERAL
<br />

<br />
A cleric can begin acquiring Alternate Abilities (AA) at level 51, for abilities that were introduced with the Shadow of Luclin (SoL) expansion, and at level 61 for abilities that came with the Planes of Power (PoP) expansion.  Note that many PoP abilities can be acquired only after several of SoL abilities have been acquired before them, so owning both SoL and PoP is pretty much a requirement.  This will be detailed later in this guide.
<br />

<br />
To acquire an ability, a cleric must spend a fixed amount of experience to train it.  All abilities require a cleric to spend one or more AA points (the exact number is given in the ability's description), and each point corresponds approximately to the amount of experience it takes to go from level 51 to 52.
<br />
I.A. REQUIREMENTS.
<br />

<br />
Many abilities can be trained only if some requirement is fulfilled.  There is a requirement on the cleric's level, and on other abilities that must be trained previously.  All abilities follow a common requirement that depends on the category they belong to (there are 4 categories) plus some specific requirement, listed in the ability description. The categories are:
<br />

<br />
    * General, a cleric only need to be level 51 to train an ability of this category, in any order.
<br />
    * Archetype, a cleric must be level 55, and have 6 AA points trained in any of the General abilities, to be able to train an Archetype ability.
<br />
    * Class, a cleric must be level 59, and have 12 AA points trained in any of the Archetype abilities, to be able to train a Class ability.  Since Archetype abilities have their own requirement, there is a minimum of 18 AA to train, 6 in General and 12 in Archetype, before a cleric has access to Class abilities.
<br />
    * Planar, a cleric only needs to be level 61 to train an ability of this category.  However many have additional requirements. 
<br />

<br />
I.B. RANKS
<br />

<br />
Several abilities increase in power as you put more AA points into them.  This is described by a rank system, a cleric can spend AA points to train the first rank of an ability, then more AA points to train the second, and so on until the last rank is trained.  For instance, Innate Run Speed has 3 ranks, each costing 1 AA point.  Therefore the first AA point a cleric spends in this ability give him the benefits of the first rank, another AA point spent and he gets the benefits of the second rank, and a third AA point finally allow him to train this ability to the maximum possible rank.
<br />

<br />
Note that, while many abilities have ranks, some don't.  And oftentimes the AA cost for the next rank is higher (like 2 AA, then 4 AA and finally 6 AA, for a total of 12 to train Spell Casting Mastery to its maximum rank).
<br />

<br />
In the game, the word 'level' is used instead of 'rank'. I have chosen to keep rank since it is commonly used by the cleric community, and to avoid confusion with regular levels.
<br />
I.C. ACTIVATED ABILITIES
<br />

<br />
Depending on how a cleric can use them, abilities are either activated or passive.  A passive ability acts all the time while an activated ability must be triggered with a button or a command line.  To obtain a button that triggers an ability, press alt-I or click on the inventory icon in the window selector, to open the inventory window.  Then click on 'Alternate advancement'.  This opens the Alternate Advancement window.  Select the appropriate panel and the ability you're looking for, then click fast once on the hotkey button on the right, and you will have the button corresponding to the ability on the cursor.  You can then click-replace a macro or a social button with this one.
<br />

<br />
To activate an ability from the command line, type /alt activate #, where # is the activation code.  Here is a list of code for all activated abilities:
<br />

<br />
35	Mass Group Buff
<br />
36	Divine Resurrection
<br />
37	Innate Invis to Undead
<br />
38	Celestial Regeneration and Celestial Renewal
<br />
39	Bestow Divine Aura
<br />
40	Turn Undead
<br />
41	Purify Soul
<br />
153	Radiant Cure
<br />
169	Divine Arbitration
<br />

<br />
Activated abilities cannot be used at any time.  Instead, they have a refresh timer attached to them, in the same way spells have a recast time.  A given ability cannot be reused until its refresh timer allows it.
<br />

<br />
During the time such ability is unavailable, the corresponding button will look pressed, and clicking on it will display a message indicating what's left on the timer.  The major difference between spell recast time and ability refresh timer is that, for abilities, the timer is real-time and counts down whether the cleric is online or not.  For instance, Divine Resurrection has a refresh timer of 18 hours.  If a cleric uses it to resurrect a corpse, then camps out of the game and logs back 2 days later, Divine Resurrection will be immediately available again.  This is true for every ability.
<br />
I.D. TITLES
<br />

<br />
As a cleric trains more abilities, he gains a new title prefix to his name.
<br />

<br />
    * After training 6 AA points in General category, the cleric becomes Baron for male characters and Baronness for female.
<br />
    * After training 12 additional AA points in Archetype category, the cleric becomes Venerable.
<br />
    * After training 24 additional AA points in Class category, the cleric becomes Exarch. 
<br />

<br />
Planar abilities do not count against titles.  It is not possible to get rid of the title you get once AA points are spent.
<br />

<br />
II. ABILITIES
<br />
II.A. GENERIC DESCRIPTION
<br />

<br />
Type
<br />

<br />
The ability type, can be either passive or activated.  An activated ability must be triggered by the cleric whereas a passive one acts all the time.
<br />

<br />
Casting
<br />

<br />
This is valid only for activated abilities.  It's the casting time of the ability, very similar to spell casting time in that you can be interrupted, and you can duck during this time.  An interrupted casting let you try again immediately.  However, Mass Group Buff is special in that aspect (see this ability for details).
<br />

<br />
An ability casting time can also be instant.  In this case it cannot be interrupted, or ducked.  You can even use it while running.
<br />

<br />
Duration
<br />

<br />
This is valid only for activated abilities.  It's the duration of the ability's effect, usually instantaneous, or a given number of ticks.  Like spells, each tick is 6 seconds.
<br />

<br />
Refresh
<br />

<br />
This is valid only for activated abilities.  It's the refresh timer associated to the ability.  A refresh timer is reset after the end of the casting (not the end of the effect).
<br />

<br />
Range
<br />

<br />
For abilities that affect a single target, the range is, like spells, the distance between the cleric and the target.  For abilities that affect the group, it's the distance from the cleric to any member that can be affected.
<br />

<br />
Activation code
<br />

<br />
This is valid only for activated abilities.  It's the number to use in the /alt activate # command.
<br />

<br />
Reference
<br />

<br />
This is valid only for activated abilities.  An ability for which a spell description exists will be listed on the Lucy site.  The reference points to the corresponding spell and is up-to-date (as opposed to my description, which may be out-of-date after a patch).
<br />

<br />
If the ability has several ranks, the reference lists all of them.
<br />

<br />
Requirement
<br />

<br />
List of requirements that must be fulfilled.  A level requirement indicates what is the minimum level the ability can be trained at.  If another ability is listed in the requirements, a cleric must have trained it at the listed rank in order to be able to train this one.
<br />

<br />
Ranks
<br />

<br />
The number of ranks for the ability.  The description details the benefits of each rank.
<br />

<br />
Points per rank
<br />

<br />
The number of AA points that must be spent to train rank x of the ability.  The first number corresponds to rank one, the second to rank two and so on up to the last rank.  Their sum is the amount of AA points necessary to train the ability to its maximum rank.
<br />

<br />
Usefulness
<br />

<br />
An indication of how useful the ability is to a cleric.  This is a compromise between my own opinion and many people that voiced their own on EQCleric.  Take it with a grain of salt, since each cleric has his play style.  Train what is best for you.  In this guide, usefulness can be very low, low, average, good or very good.  The only exceptions are Innate Intelligence and Advanced Innate Intelligence, for which I really don't see why a cleric would train them.
<br />

<br />
Abbreviation
<br />

<br />
The short name most commonly used to designate the ability.  Most are taken from the EQCleric forum.
<br />

<br />
Usually, the abbreviation is followed by the rank it is trained to, for instance ND3 is Natural Durability at rank 3.  Here is a list of all abbreviations listed in this guide:

This ability allows a cleric to instantly make a character invulnerable.  The cleric selects a target and clicks the hotkey, or type /alt activate 39, to give the target all the benefits of the Divine Aura spell.
<br />

<br />
A character under Divine Aura can still click it off, can be death touched by some monsters and can be summoned, but is otherwise invulnerable to any type of attack and cannot attack, cast a spell or use an activated ability.  A monk protected by BDA can still feign death, but a shadowknight or necromancer cannot (they cannot cast the spell).  A caster protected by BDA after he has begun to cast a spell will finish casting and the spell will take effect, but not on him.  For example if a wizard casting an evac spell is being hit by BDA mid-casting, he will not evac but the rest of his group will.
<br />

<br />
Spell Casting Reinforcement and Spell Casting Reinforcement Mastery increase the duration of the bestowed Divine Aura.
<br />

Bestowing Divine Aura generates aggro if the target is on a hate list.

This ability improves a cleric ability to channel a spell while being beaten up and pushed.  It operates on two factors:
<br />

<br />
    * If a cleric doesn't move but is being hit, his spell can be interrupted, based on his channeling skill.  Channeling Focus reduces the rate of interrupts.
<br />
    * If a cleric moves while casting, the spell will be interrupted if the location at the end is too far away from the location when he started casting (note that if you run through half the zone then come back to finish casting the spell, you can still channel it.  Corners are your friends).  Channeling Focus increases the range where you can cast and not be interrupted. 
<br />

<br />
As of this writing, there is no solid data on how improved is channeling at rank 3, but it is considered situationally useful.

<br />
This ability allows a cleric to be missed more in melee fight.  Defensive abilities operates on two factors: avoidance (blows that don't land) and mitigation (blows that deal less damage).  Combat Agility is an avoidance defensive ability.  It affects melee hits and innate procs (procs that occur only on a hit) but neither nukes nor AoE damage.
<br />

<br />
This ability can be further improved with Lightning Reflexes.
<br />

<br />
At rank 1 the chance of a miss is increased by 2%.

This ability decreases the damage a cleric receives when being hit.  Defensive abilities operates on two factors: avoidance (blows that don't land) and mitigation (blows that deal less damage).  Combat Stability is a mitigation defensive ability, that translate into a chance that your opponent will hit for lowest damage instead of normal damage.  It affects melee hits but neither procs nor AoE damage.  Generally, clerics prefer to train Combat Agility before Combat Stability.
<br />

<br />
This ability allows a cleric to share all the damage done to his group evenly among all members.  After casting, all hitpoints of every group member within range are added, and compared to their current maximum hitpoints.  The difference is the sum of damage currently done to the group (again, within range).  If this difference is 0, or the cleric is not grouped, or all other members are out of range, the ability fails with a message, and is immediately available for a next try. In the case the group damage is not 0, a penalty is applied which depends on the rank of the ability, 20% at rank 1.  That means at this rank the group damage is multiplied by 1.2.  Once this penalty is applied, the group damage is then evenly redistributed to all members in range, assuming full hitpoints.
<br />

<br />
The benefits of this ability are multiple: it casts fast and since it's not a spell it can be used right after a heal.  Assuming rank 3 (no penalty), if a member of a group of 6 is low on hitpoints and others are at their current maximum, the member with low hitpoints receives a heal equivalent to 5/6 of his current damage and all others suffer 1/6 of this same damage, which in situations where only one member is taking hits is a very fast and mana free heal.  Also, it generates exactly zero aggro and for this reason is often used with pullers feigning death, to heal them without aggravating the creature they pulled.
<br />

<br />
A cleric under Divine Aura or Divine Barrier cannot use any activated ability including Divine Arbitration.  However, there is no way to prevent the loss or gain of hitpoints due to this ability, so if another cleric in his group uses it, he will be healed or damaged even invulnerable.  For the same reason, Bestow Divine Aura followed by Divine Arbitration will heal a now invulnerable group member.
<br />

<br />
Rank 1 can be trained at 61 or later and the penalty is 20%.
<br />

<br />
Rank 2 can be trained at 63 or later and the penalty is 10%.
<br />

<br />
Rank 3 can be trained at 65 and there is no penalty.

Abbreviation: DR or GM rezz
<br />

<br />
This ability allows a cleric to resurrect a corpse with several benefits: it's a 100% xp restoration, at full hitpoints and mana, and without rezz effect.  All other conditions on resurrection spells apply.  The target character will see a resurrection box pop up (with "divine resurrection" and the percentage displayed) and can still accept or reject the rezz.  In any case, the ability is used and will not be available until the next 18 hours.  The same thing occurs if the character is zoning, the ability is used and the resurrection fails.
<br />

<br />
A common use of this ability is to instantly rezz someone in the middle of a fight (it cannot be interrupted).  Another one is to rezz the corpse normally (epic is best), let the character loot is corpse but for one item, then give the corpse a Divine Resurrection (since corpses can be resurrected several times).  The character accepts the divine resurrection and is restored to full HP and mana, including everything that comes from his gear, which often amounts for a large part of his mana.
<br />

<br />
Like all resurrection spells, this ability doesn't generate any aggro.

This ability increases the percentage of total hitpoints a cleric can heal using the Bind Wounds skill.  At 210 skill (current Bind Wounds cap for a level 65 cleric as of October 2003) a cleric can heal up to 70% and the amount healed by each application of Bind Wounds is 50 HP.
<br />

<br />
This ability does not increase the amount healed, but only the maximum number of hitpoints a cleric can heal, hence the very low usefulness of this ability.
<br />

<br />
At rank 1 the percentage is increased by 10%.
<br />

<br />
At rank 2 the percentage is increased by 20%.
<br />

<br />
At rank 3 the percentage is increased by 30%.  A cleric with maxed Bind Wounds can therefore heal a character completely with this skill.

This ability gives a cleric a chance to perform a critical heal on direct heal spells.  It doesn't affect heal over time spells.  If a critical heal is performed, it doubles the amount of hitpoints healed (after increase from Healing Adept but before Improved Healing focus effect, if any).  This ability also works with Complete Heal, group direct heal spells and procs that do a direct heal (single target or group).
<br />

<br />
This ability can be further improved with Advanced Healing Gift.
<br />

<br />
At rank 1 the chance of performing a critical heal is 3%.
<br />

<br />
At rank 2 the chance of performing a critical heal becomes 6%.
<br />

<br />
At rank 3 the chance of performing a critical heal becomes 10%.

This ability increases the cleric base agility.  A cleric might consider training this ability if, with gear and buffs factored, his agility is right below a threshold.  The most common issue is for dwarf and erudite clerics to reach 75 agility, since this dramatically affects their AC.
<br />

This ability increases the cleric base charisma.  This ability is almost useless because, at the level it becomes available, it is often possible to obtain for cheap two of these items: Opal Encrusted Stein Slot: PRIMARY, SECONDARY CHA: +25 MANA: +10 WT: 0.6 Size: SMALL Class: ALL Race: ALL
<br />

<br />
For the purpose of selling to or buying from vendors, almost every cleric holding these two steins will reach 104 charisma, which gives the best prices.
<br />

<br />
Death Pact and Divine Intervention (cast on self) and Lull spells are also charisma-based.  For the purpose of maximizing chances of success for these spells, a cleric could consider raising his charisma.
<br />

<br />
This ability can be further improved with Advanced Innate Charisma.

This ability increases the cleric defensive skills, extending the general ability Combat Stability.  A cleric can spend 3 AA points in this ability for each level he has beyond 60, up to 15 AA points at 65.  Note that this is the maximum AA points that can be spent, a cleric is not required to spend them at a given level but can instead spend 12 points in one shot at 64 for instance.  See the Combat Stability ability for details about the benefits of increasing mitigation defensive skills.

This ability increases the cap on intelligence and wisdom.  See Planar Power for details on stat caps.  A cleric can spend 3 AA points in this ability for each level he has beyond 60, up to 15 AA points at 65.  Note that this is the maximum AA points that can be spent, a cleric is not required to spend them at a given level but can instead spend 12 points in one shot at 64 for instance, to raise the cap by 40.

<br />
This ability allows a cleric to make him invisible to undead, similarly to the spell Invisibility to Undead.  The duration of this invisibility is random, but fortunately the refresh time is quite short.  The use of this ability is situational, as it can often be replaced with Improved Invisibility to Undead, which gives a long, fixed duration.  It's a convenient ability in that it's doesn't take a slot, and is instant.  Another use of this ability is to instantly kill a summoned pet if needs be, since the only way a cleric can kill his pet is by becoming invisible.

This ability reduces the rate at which a cleric consumes food and drink.  This ability becomes especially useful when using a mount and stat food and drink.  Without stat food and drink, a cleric can summon bread and water on its own for free, so training this ability is a matter of convenience.  However some stat food and drink can be expensive, and force feeding normal bread and water quickly becomes annoying.  For these reasons Innate Metabolism is quite a popular ability among clerics.
<br />

<br />
At rank 1 the rate of consumption is reduced by 10%.
<br />

This ability increases the cleric base speed.  Unless you own an item with speed increasing effect (like Journeyman's Boots) this ability is probably the first one you should train.  The increased speed it gives works everywhere, including dungeons.
<br />

<br />
However, it doesn't stack with other effects.  When using a mount, the cleric moves at the mount's speed even if it's slower than what this ability gives.

This ability increases the cleric base stamina.  Since increasing stamina increases hitpoints as well, clerics with lots of AA points eventually train this ability (unless they have so good a gear that stamina is maxed already).  However, the hitpoint gain per stamina is low, ranging from 2.5 to 3.3 HP/sta.  The Natural Durability ability gives better results.

This ability increases the cleric base strength.  You might consider training this ability if being encumbered is a recurrent problem for you (it lowers agility and therefore AC as well).  Strength plays only a minor role in the ability for a cleric to deal damage.

This ability increases the cleric base wisdom.  There are two schools regarding this ability.  Even though wisdom is the primary stat for clerics and more wisdom gives more mana, many feel that they will max their wisdom eventually (if not already), and that these points will be wasted.  The other school argues that since clerics must spend 6 points in general abilities before having access to archetype abilities, they might as well increase their wisdom. Obviously a gnome cleric in low-end gear needs more wisdom increase than a high-elf cleric with high-end gear.  So just choose what's best for you.
<br />

<br />
This ability can be further improved with Advanced Innate Wisdom.
<br />

<br />
Each rank increases the cleric base wisdom by 2 points.
<br />

<br />
For how much mana per wisdom a cleric has, the rule of thumb is (shamelessly taken from Saarem's F.a.q. post at EQCleric):
<br />

<br />
    * Each point of wisdom below 200 is worth 10 mana at 50, and 12 mana at 60.
<br />
    * Each point of wisdom over 200 is worth 5 mana at 50 and 6 mana at 60.
<br />
    * Each point of wisdom above 255 is worth 3 mana at 61+.

See the Combat Agility ability for details about the benefits of increasing avoidance defensive skills.

At this time (October 2003) there is no solid data on the benefits of this ability, but clerics who have trained it at rank 5 seem to consider it's worth it.

Abbreviation: MGB
<br />

<br />
This ability allows a cleric to cast a single-group buff onto several groups or characters.  When a cleric activates this ability, he receives a message indicating that the next group buff he casts will affect everyone in the buff range.  Only spells that can be cast on other groups can benefit of this ability.  As of October 2003 the list goes as follow:
<br />

<br />
    * Ancient Gift of Aegolism
<br />
    * Blessing of Aegolism
<br />
    * Ethereal Elixir
<br />
    * Hand of Virtue
<br />
    * Heroic Bond
<br />
    * Kazad's Mark
<br />
    * Marzin's Mark
<br />
    * Naltron's Mark 
<br />

<br />
Celestial Regeneration and Celestial Renewal can also be cast on multiple groups.
<br />

<br />
Sunskin, while technically a group buff, is not affected by this ability.  If you activate MGB but cast a non-eligible group buff, the ability is lost until refreshed.
<br />

<br />
Level limits for buff spells also apply to characters in the range.  Therefore a low-level character will not receive the benefit of Ethereal Elixir even when using MGB.
<br />

<br />
Casting the buff spell also uses up to twice the normal mana, even if only the group is in range.  Up to means that if this extra mana is available, it will be used.  But if it isn't the spell still affects everyone in the range.
<br />

<br />
Example with Blessing of Aegolism: if a cleric is full mana (let's say 4500 for the sake of this example), clicking the MGB hotkey or typing /alt activate 35, then casting Blessing of Aegolism (on a target which will be the center of the affected area) will use 4000 mana.  If the same cleric had 3200 mana, he would still be able to use MGB and all his mana would be used.  If he had less than 2000 mana, he wouldn't be able to cast the spell, until he meditates to 2000 mana.
<br />

<br />
Leaving the zone or camping out doesn't reset the timer, but disable the use of MGB until refreshed.  To reset MGB, cast a group buff (any group spell will do) and duck mid-casting.  This resets the ability timer and you can activate MGB again and use it.

This ability allows a cleric to reach a skill level greater than 200 in tradeskills.  Without any points put into this ability, anyone can reach 250 in a single tradeskill but is limited to 200 in all others.  By training ranks in this ability, a cleric overcomes this limitation for other tradeskills.

This ability increases the cap on all stats (agility, charisma, dexterity, intelligence, stamina, strength and wisdom).  For all stats, there is a cap level beyond which a high value gives no benefit.  The cap is identical for all stats and depends only on the cleric level and the number of AA spent in this ability.
<br />

<br />
Up to level 60 the cap is 255 (i.e. having 256 or more in a stat gives the same benefit as having only 255).  Then, the cap is raised by 5 points per level beyond 60 (for up to +25) and rank in this ability (for up to +25), for a maximum cap of 305.
<br />

<br />
With Innate Enlightenment, the cap on both intelligence and wisdom can be further raised to 355 (see this ability for details).
<br />

<br />
A cleric can spend 2 AA points in this ability for each level he has beyond 60, up to 10 AA points at 65.  Note that this is the maximum AA points that can be spent, a cleric is not required to spend them at a given level but can instead spend 8 points in one shot at 64 for instance, to raise the cap to 295.
<br />

<br />
A clerics benefits from raising the cap only if one of his stats is above it.
<br />

<br />
Each rank increases the cap on all stats together by +5 points.

Purify Soul
<br />

<br />
Type: Activated
<br />

<br />
Casting: Instant  Duration: Instant  Refresh: 30mn
<br />

<br />
Range: 100  Activation code: 41  Reference: Lucy
<br />

<br />
Requirement: Level 59, Healing Gift at rank 3
<br />

<br />
Ranks: 1   Points per rank: 5
<br />

<br />
Usefulness: Low
<br />

<br />
This ability allows a cleric to instantly cure a single target of pretty much every detrimental effect it's suffering.  See the reference link above for details.  Any use of this ability is however very situational, because several other abilities (Radiant Cure) or spells (Abolish Poison, Abolish Disease, Greater Remove Curse) can cure a target, or even the group, and they have very low refresh time.  Note that only Radiant Cure has a chance of curing a detrimental effect that has no counter, but it does it on the group rather than on a single target.  On the other hand, Purify Soul is much more powerful at curing such effects, and cures several of them at the same time.
<br />

<br />
Neither Radiant Cure or Purify Soul cure charm, fear or remove the resurrection effect.
<br />

<br />
This ability can be further improved with Hastened Purification of the Soul.

Abbreviation: RC
<br />

<br />
This ability allows a cleric to cure all members of his group (within range) of many detrimental effects including effects that have no counters.  It is much less powerful than Purify Soul, but acts on the group and has a much shorter refresh time.  See the reference links above for details.  The first rank of the ability cannot cure more than one effect of each type (poison, disease, curse and counter-less effects).  Next ranks remove more counters, but still can only cure one effect of each type.
<br />

<br />
Neither Radiant Cure or Purify Soul cure charm, fear or remove the resurrection effect.
<br />

<br />
Rank 1 can be trained at 61 or later and cures 9 poison / disease / curse counters.
<br />

<br />
Rank 2 can be trained at 63 or later and cures 12 poison / disease / curse counters.
<br />

<br />
Rank 3 can be trained at 65 and cures 16 poison / disease / curse counters.

<br />
This ability increases the cleric poison resistance, extending the general ability Innate Poison Protection.  A cleric can spend 2 AA points in this ability for each level he has beyond 60, up to 10 AA points at 65.  Note that this is the maximum AA points that can be spent, a cleric is not required to spend them at a given level but can instead spend 8 points in one shot at 64 for instance.  See the Innate Poison Protection ability for details about the benefits of increasing this resistance.
<br />

<br />
Each rank increases the cleric base poison resistance by 2 points, resulting in a maximum increase (with this ability alone) of 20 points.

This ability gives a cleric a chance to perform a critical nuke on direct damage spells.  It doesn't affect damage over time spells.  If a critical nuke is performed, it increases the amount of damage dealt (before increase from focus effects, if any).
<br />

<br />
This ability also works with AoE damage spells and procs that do direct damage (single target or group) including Hands of the Gods.
<br />

<br />
This ability can be further improved with Fury of Magic.
<br />

<br />
At rank 1 the damage is increased by 33% and the chance of performing a critical nuke is 2%.
<br />

<br />
At rank 2 the damage is increased by 66% and the chance of performing a critical nuke becomes 4%.
<br />

<br />
At rank 3 the damage is doubled and the chance of performing a critical nuke becomes 7%.

This ability reduces the mana a cleric spends to cast a spell.  It works on every spell, and stacks with focus effects.  However, a cleric must have enough mana without taking this ability into account to be able to start casting a spell.  Mana reduction abilities and effects (including specialisation) operate after the spell cast has been started.
<br />

<br />
The cleric community considers this ability one of the best.
<br />

<br />
At rank 1 the mana saving is 2%.
<br />

<br />
At rank 2 the mana saving is 5%.
<br />

<br />
At rank 3 the mana saving is 10%.

This ability increases the duration of all beneficial buffs, including heal over time.  It stacks with focus effects, however most focus effects have a minimum duration requirement or exclude certain spells, and therefore don't increase the duration of Supernal Elixir or Divine Aura for instance.
<br />

<br />
This ability can be further improved with Spell Casting Reinforcement Mastery.
<br />

<br />
At rank 1 the duration is increased by 5%.
<br />

<br />
At rank 2 the duration is increased by 15%.
<br />

<br />
At rank 3 the duration is increased by 30%.

Turn Undead
<br />

<br />
Type: Activated
<br />

<br />
Casting: Varies  Duration: 4 ticks  Refresh: 1h 12mn
<br />

<br />
Range: 35  Activation code: 40  Reference: Rank 1/2/3 at Lucy

Requirement: Level 59, 12 AA points spent in Archetype category

<br />
Ranks: 3   Points per rank: 3/6/9
<br />

<br />
Usefulness: Very low
<br />

<br />
This ability allows a cleric to fear and put a damage over time spell on all undeads within a 35' range.  The fear effect and the DoT last for 4 ticks, however each rank inflicts more damage per tick.
<br />

<br />
This effect has a -1000 resist modifier and is therefore pretty much irresistible.  While it seems powerful, this ability has several issues that make it unattractive.  First of all, the casting time goes from 2.5 to 7.5 seconds (at rank 3).  With such a long casting time it is difficult to use this ability without being interrupted.  Second of all, the fear component works only on undeads that are level 54 or lower.  Because of this, higher level monsters are unaffected by both the fear but also the DoT component, making them immune to this ability in practice.  And third of all, even if it lands, the fear component will send all of them away, aggroing other creatures as they come back.
<br />

<br />
The duration of this ability is not increased by Spell Casting Reinforcement.
<br />

<br />
At rank 1 the casting time is 2.5 seconds and the DoT is 250 HP per tick.
<br />

<br />
At rank 2 the casting time is 5 seconds and the DoT is 1250 HP per tick.
<br />

<br />
At rank 3 the casting time is 7.5 seconds and the DoT is 2500 HP per tick.

<br />
This ability increases the likelihood of a Death Pact or Divine Intervention spell to successfully heal their target.
<br />

<br />
As we understand these spells today (October 2003), if a character buffed with Death Pact or Divine Intervention takes damage and his hitpoints drop below 15% of his maximum, there is a chance that he will get healed, and the spell then fades (oversimplified view of the spell mechanics, but what matters is the trigger concept).  Death Pact heals for 300 HP, Divine Intervention completely heals the character.
<br />

<br />
The probability that the spell fires off is based on the character's charisma, the higher the charisma, the better the probability.  Unfailing Divinity increases this probability, additional ranks giving an even better chance of success.  Also, with Divine Intervention it gives a chance to get a small heal even if the spell fails, the amount healed being of the order of 1500 HP per rank.
<br />

<br />
Rank 1 can be trained at 61 or later.
<br />

<br />
Rank 2 can be trained at 63 or later.
<br />

<br />
Rank 3 can be trained at 65.

This ability increases the cleric fire resistance, extending the general ability Innate Fire Protection.  A cleric can spend 2 AA points in this ability for each level he has beyond 60, up to 10 AA points at 65.  Note that this is the maximum AA points that can be spent, a cleric is not required to spend them at a given level but can instead spend 8 points in one shot at 64 for instance.  See the Innate Fire Protection ability for details about the benefits of increasing this resistance.
<br />

<br />
Each rank increases the cleric base fire resistance by 2 points, resulting in a maximum increase (with this ability alone) of 20 points.
