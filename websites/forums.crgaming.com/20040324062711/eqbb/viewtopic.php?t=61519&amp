Chapter 1 (pilot chapter)
<br />

<br />
"The Fateful Day"
<br />

<br />

<br />
Yep here I go again, writing another story line, it tangles in with the others but you won't notice it.  Until much later.  Think of it as a fresh beginning and please help me.
<br />

<br />

<br />
It had been raining all day long, all Magus wanted to do was go to town and find some sort of adventure.  He'd been like this ever since his parents sent him to train with his Grandfather at the small shrine they had in the mountainous area located in the western most part of the Karanas.
<br />

<br />
"I wonder... Just what is in that cave....."
<br />

<br />
"Always keep your guard up!!!!"
<br />

<br />
"What the...?!"
<br />

<br />
Magus had left his guard down again during sword practice and for his mistake had been struck over the head with his grandfathers walking stick.  Which I might add left a nasty red mark across the young man's forehead and also got a chuckle out of his grandmother.
<br />

<br />
"Don't be so hard on him, he's so much like you where when you where his age."
<br />

<br />
"If he doesn't learn now it'll be harder for him to learn later on after he picks up all those bad habits that other fighters have."
<br />

<br />
"Other fighters?! You mean you intending for him to join the Antonica Fighter's Tournament held in Freeport later this year?!"
<br />

<br />
Magus looked back and forth at his grandparents bickering and sighed.  His grandmother didn't exactly disapprove of him training, but then again she didn't want him to use the skills he was being taught.  Again his thoughts drifted back to what could be held in that cave.
<br />

<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />

<br />
Deep within the bowels of the cave a woman sat, she didn't look a day over seventeen, but she had been there for several hundred years, apparently sleeping.  Truth be known she wasn't human even though she looked like it.  Within her mind though she was very awake, thoughts of revenge and what she would do to the man who imprisoned her so long ago.  A small smile crept across her face as she lay waiting for something to disrupt the wards place on the stone door,  she sensed her freedom was coming soon, and the person who would free her would be the first to feel her wrath.
<br />

<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />

<br />
Magus had somehow managed to slip away from the shrine and was walking through the woods near the cave on his way to Qeynos where his great grandfather lived. The usual task to earn his great grandfathers silence on his adventures was to fetch the old man something or capture images of the women in the local baths, which was pretty simple enough since he had already been trained to become an expert theif by his father.  However today he was determined to find out just what was in the cave, if the legends of a beast being killed that could destroy armies had really been buried here. It nothing flat Magus had picked the lock to the iron gates of the cave, a smile crossing his face.
<br />

<br />
"Now to see just whats in here..."
<br />

<br />
Magus slowly stepped inside the cave and as he walked further in the air began to grow stale, along the walls where old torches had long since been light. He had been in such awe at what the cave looked like that he hadn't been paying attention to where he was stepping until it was to late.
<br />

<br />
"What the hell?!"
<br />

<br />
A giant guillotine dropped from the ceiling and had nearly split him in two. He figured anything this closely guarded must be interesting, and he pushed into the depths of the cave, avoiding the trigger stones that where laced across the floor.  Then he came to a stone door, one that had strange, ancient writing upon it, that which he had never seen.
<br />

<br />
"I really should ask that old man to teach me to read the ancient languages..."
<br />

<br />
Magus shrugged and examined the door, he figured it must of been several feet thick, it was definitely going to be difficult to open, or so he thought as he leaded against the wall and fell, the next thing he knew was he slipped on the stone floor and landed with a smack on the floor.  With that he was out like a light, hearing the sound of the stone door sliding open as he blacked out.
<br />

<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />

<br />
She smiled, finally someone had opened the door to her tomb. As she quickly sat up and stood, slowly gaining her bearing she could see someone outside on the floor, a smirk crossed her face as she stumbled over to the boy laying unconscious on the floor, she was going to have fun with him.
<br />

<br />
"Wake up! Hey!"
<br />

<br />
She kicked him a few times and got no response, all she could do was shrug, it wouldn't be very fun to kill him while he was asleep, but at least she was free.  She would definitely have some fun with him later. She slowly faded from view, waiting for the right time to strike.
<br />

<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />

<br />
Magus slowly awoke, rubbing his eyes as he stared into an empty room and sighed.  It was all a legend after all, if there was a beast it must of rotted away long ago and turned to dust.  Suddenly he looked out towards the caves entrance, it was night! He must of been out for hours, in a flash he was up and running out of the cave, heading to the city to have what little fun he could before he could slip back to the shrine.
<br />

<br />
At night Qeynos is not at all like the bustling port town of the day, the bars are usually packed full with patrons. Tonight was no exception as Magus rushed into his great grandfathers house, waiting to hear what the old man would trade for his silence.
<br />

<br />
"Lets see, what could I use from you this time sonny?  I know! I want you to go get me something from the Bayle families home, but what?"
<br />

<br />
"Knowing you it'll be some womans underwear", Magus mumbled, he knew the old man to well.
<br />

<br />
"What was that boy?"
<br />

<br />
"Nothing...."
<br />

<br />
"All right your task tonight is simple, all you have to do is sneak in, capture some images of the young lady Bayle in this mystic mirror and bring it back to me."
<br />

<br />
"Should of known, you old pervert...", Magus once again mumbled as he walked from the house.
<br />

<br />
Magus knew he could do this task easy enough, but then again this feeling that all would not go right kept nagging at him, even as he slipped over the stone wall towards the Bayle Family Estate. It was an easy enough task to sneak up behind the guard standing watch at the front entrance, and was even easier to slip past him once a well placed strike knocked him unconscious. After dispatching several more guards Magus found himself in the room of the young lady Bayle. The worst possible thing that could happen actually did happen, for as he tilted the mirror to catch enough light to catch her image she woke up. Normally this wouldn't have been a problem except that he'd neglected to put the rest of the guards to sleep in his haste.
<br />

<br />
"Guards! Intruder!!!!"
<br />

<br />
"Aw damn, why'd this have to happen to me?!"
<br />

<br />
Magus ran out to the balcony just as several guards burst into the room, this was going to be one hell of a night for him, this much was certain. Of course his luck wasn't getting much better as he seen the guards on the grounds below had begun to converge on the area near the balcony. It was now or never for his escape as he leapt from the balcony and made a running dash for the stone wall, dodging arrows the entire distance.
<br />

<br />
"All I wanted to do was have some fun and instead I'm going to be hung all on the kind of that dirty old man..."
<br />

<br />
Magus barely managed to jump over the wall as he continued to run.  Thinking on the run was becoming a habit of his, one he wished he didn't have the luxury of forming.  Well at least he thought he was having some excitement, but the idea of being hung for it wasn't what he had planned.
<br />

<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />

<br />
She smirked as she watched this young man from the shadows, she'd never seen a human this fast before, or this agile, but then again she had never seen one with nearly white hair either.  He was definitely going to be fun to play with, at least until she could sate her thirst for revenge on the man who had imprisoned her. Still this one amazed her as he had somehow managed to slip past every guard patrolling for him, and had actually managed to sneak inside what appeared to be the Mages guild house.
<br />

<br />
"This one will be fun..."
<br />

<br />
She said with a cackle and slowly began to close in on the young boy.  She thought she was going to use him for a warm up for her next encounter, as she followed him closely to the roof of the building.  It was perfect, he had his back to her and was staring out over the city. It was then that she decided to take action and leapt from the shadows.....
<br />

<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />

<br />
Magus was hit from behind and skidded across the roof on the side of his face, whatever hit him sure packed one hell of a punch, and as he stood back up he laid eyes on his assailant.  It was a woman, she looked stunning in her tight fitting dress, but it wasn't that feature that caught his eye, it was the fact that her eyes where glowing an amber color.
<br />

<br />
"Your certainly tougher than you look. Oh well consider that a little love tap for releasing me from my prison."
<br />

<br />
"Prison?! You mean...."
<br />

<br />
"Thats right, I was the one in that tomb back in that cave, and I'm so thankful for you releasing me, matter a fact I'm so thankful that I'm going to give you a small taste of what I'm going to give that Sorcerer Cain who imprisoned me."
<br />

<br />
"But thats my gre...."
<br />

<br />
Before he could say another word the woman rushed at him again, only this time he barely managed to move out of the way, and in the process gave her a leg sweep that sent her flying over the edge.  To what he thought was her apparent doom, so naturally he began to walk away from the edge. This was a mistake.
<br />

<br />
"Nice moves, but you'll have to do better than that human."
<br />

<br />
Magus swallowed hard and turned around to look, the woman was just floating there in the air.  He was in deep trouble, he knew it as soon as he pointed a hand at him, a hand that was had glowing amber mana surrounding it.
<br />

<br />
"What'd I do to deserve this?!"
<br />

<br />
Magus rushed for the door, flinging it open as he rushed down the steps, about halfway down the stairs he received a direct hit from an amber ball of mana that sent him crashing down the steps and into a wall. He knew there must be a way to defeat her as he frantically searched for a place to hide, and he found it in one of the magicians laboratories.  He held his breath as the woman slowly walked past him, and as he managed to make out in the darkness there where various poisons lined up on the wall, a smile crossed his face as he noticed two of the most foul smelling poisons he could remember. His father always told him never to mix this particular two because they could cause an explosion if exposed to heat right afterwards.
<br />

<br />
"Now lets see her try that again.."
<br />

<br />
"Try what again?"
<br />

<br />
The woman smiled as she seemed to slip through the door as if she where a ghost, he had just enough time to grab the two bottles and uncap them behind his back.  This would definitely be something to remember.
<br />

<br />
"By the way, my ancestor was the Sorcerer Cain..."
<br />

<br />
"Then your his spawn! You will die!!!"
<br />

<br />
At that the woman rushed him, mana surging through her hands as she did so.  At that same moment Magus threw the bottles at her, the resulting explosion threw him from the building and onto the street below.  He simply grumbled as he stood up, the burns on his back throbbing with pain.
<br />

<br />
"She wasn't half bad looking, well I guess I should get going now..."
<br />

<br />
"Thats no way to treat a woman!!!!"
<br />

<br />
The woman growled as she pulled herself from the rubble and leapt down infront of him.  In the far off distance they both heard an explosion, and then guards screaming out orders to one another, and then a guard rushed down the street yelling as loud as humanly possible.
<br />

<br />
"To arms! The Torn Ear and Black Burrow Gnolls are attacking!"
<br />

<br />
Magus groaned, it was now certain that he'd never make it home in time to keep this little excursion a secret, but never the less he was going to try, and at that he took off running leaving the woman dumbfounded at what was going on.
<br />

<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />

<br />
"Where is that boy, I thought I told him that I was going to teach him some special techniques tonight."
<br />

<br />
"Oh, I seen him heading for the city eariler, now don't go into one of your rants, the boy just wants to have alittle fun."
<br />

<br />
"Well I just want to make sure he learned what I have to teach him, I don't want him to find out the hard way about using his gifts."
<br />

<br />
Magus's grandfather had to learn the hard way about harnessing his gifts, he had no one else to teach him and all his experience came from actual battle. He knew that battle was no place to experiment on such abilities.
<br />

<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />

<br />
Magus ducked as the gnoll swung its sword at him, without a weapon he was forced to use hand to hand combat, something he never really appreciated until now as he gave the gnoll an uppercut, sending it reeling backwards into several other gnolls.
<br />

<br />
"Hey where are you going?! We're not finished yet!"
<br />

<br />
The woman had followed him, intent on settling the dispute once and for all, instead she was forced back against the Qeynos city walls by several of the gnolls spells, and as Magus glanced back at her some deep seeded instinct triggered in his mind, even if she did try to kill him, he simply couldn't allow her to die without having a fighting chance.
<br />

<br />
"Hey over here!"
<br />

<br />
Magus was purposely taunting the gnolls, drawing their attacks at him, but the woman couldn't understand why he would do such a thing. That is until she seen him cross his arms infront of his face in a defensive stance just as a burst of fire was about to hit him, instead of incinerating him it split of in all directions, igniting the gnolls around him.
<br />

<br />
"Well aren't you hot stuff? Maybe I should keep you instead of killing you."
<br />

<br />
"Gah, the hell if you will!"
<br />

<br />
Magus took off running, dodging gnolls left and right as they swung at him, and of course the woman followed close behind him, batting gnolls away left and right as she gave chase. By now it was obvious she as much stronger than he could of imagined.  However, his mind was quickly drawn to the heated sensation, the woman had hurled a orb of mana at him and had scorched the seat of his pants
<br />

<br />
"Ah damn!!!!!"
<br />

<br />
Magus patted the flames out as the woman cackled in laughter, indeed she was having fun with him, but this was also drawing the attention of some of the stronger gnolls of the horde, that is until she incinerated them with a sphere of mana. Only to turn her attentions back to Magus.
<br />

<br />
"Thats the last time I ever try to be nosey around old ruins again, cause no matter what you always end up with an old nag of a problem."
<br />

<br />
"Who're you calling a nag!"
<br />

<br />
A flip of her wrist and a ball of mana struck the ground at Magus's feet, sending him reeling through the air, only to land on his back. Then it struck him, if he could get her to exaust herself maybe he stood a chance.
<br />

<br />
"Thats right I said an old nag! Come on you heifer, give me your best shot!"
<br />

<br />
Again and again she hurled spheres of mana at Magus, this time he was ready and began to dodge them, he was actually having fun now. He laughed and taunted her again.
<br />

<br />
"Looks like your beginning to sag from old age!"
<br />

<br />
"Thats it your toast! When I get my hands on you......"
<br />

<br />
She was flustered, now she was so angry she wasn't aiming anymore, she was simply slinging orbs of mana in every which direction until she was infact exhausted and was breathing in gasps. At which point Magus turned and started to walk away, only to be struck from behind by her, this time however she was wielding a sword of pure mana.
<br />

<br />
"Take that you little creep!"
<br />

<br />
The sword had cut deep into his left arm, almost to the bone, he was all out of options, and just as she swung at him again something amazing had happened.  A strange sword had appeared in his hands, the hilt was definitely real but the blade, the blade was made of pure energy.  He knew for certain it wasn't mana  Again and again the swords clashed, sparks of mana and energy spraying through the air.  Finally as luck would have it he landed a blow to her right arm causing her to jump back.
<br />

<br />
"I'll get you for this I swear it!"
<br />

<br />
At that she was gone, and at the same time the sword he was wielding had disappeared.  It was a long walk back to the shrine, all he could think of was that woman, what was she, and more importantly when would she be coming back, those where Magus's last thoughts as he crossed the threshold of the shrine and collapsed from the pain of his injuries and the loss of blood....</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

Chapter 2
<br />

<br />
"Mysteries Revealed"
<br />

<br />

<br />
Well I'm writing again on this series, odd I know but hell I have some idea's for it and I need to get to working on them before I lose them.  Many of you are most likely solid fans, and I hope that this delivers some of the action you where missing.
<br />

<br />
Magus's Grandfather snorted, even his own son had never been this much trouble, but perhaps that was the price of taking on a youngster like this. Well it was either train the boy himself, or let the only other person capable of using their gifts train him, and at the moment that wasn't exactly to high on his list of things to wish for. The old man simply smiled as he seen Magus was having a nightmare, this would have to be punishment enough until he woke up.
<br />

<br />
The nightmare was simple enough for Magus, before him in his acursed dream lay the temple in ruins, blood covering the ground as well as his own hands.  He had caused all the destruction and death simply because he had something he never truly wanted.  An unimaginable power, the likes of which mortals should never have, soon enough he awoke screaming in horror.
<br />

<br />
"And that my dear boy is what could happen if you don't learn what I have to teach."
<br />

<br />
"Nothing ever is private around this place from you is it...", Magus frowned, his grandather was so watchful sometimes.
<br />

<br />
"Remember, your training is to prepare you for the future, so how did you get hurt this time? Did some damsel catch you spying on her?", Magus's grandfather chuckled.
<br />

<br />
"Would you stop pestering the boy, besides he has a visitor, some brunette is here to see him, she has the oddest amber eyes though."
<br />

<br />
Magus turned as white as a sheet, it couldn't be her, she was probably long gone already, but sure enough to his horror it was her.
<br />

<br />
"Oh is this his room!"
<br />

<br />
The young girl rushed into the room and leapt on Magus, feigning her emotions with empty tears of joy.  Of course this sent chills down the young mans spine, here was the very woman who tried to kill him last night, and worse yet, he was in no shape to defend himself.
<br />

<br />
"Oh my hero, I can't thank him enough for beating all those scary gnolls for me last night!"
<br />
"I... Eerr... That is... I uh...."
<br />

<br />
"Oh is that how he got hurt, well if thats the case all is forgiven grandson."
<br />

<br />
"Now you be quiet and shut up... Make one wrong move now and I'll tear you apart.", the woman whispered into Magus's ear with a smirk.
<br />

<br />
The old man smiled at his grandson, and along with his grandmother left the room. He had heard all that the woman had said, he knew the truth all to well, the only thing he really didn't know about was the woman true intentions.  She had a eerie calmness about her, and was much stronger than she looked.
<br />

<br />
"Are you here to try and kill me again?"
<br />

<br />
"Well that thought did cross my mind, except I know nothing of this world."
<br />

<br />
"So in return for helping you out I suppose I keep my life?"
<br />

<br />
"That's right cutie pie!"
<br />

<br />
Magus shived, this woman or whatever it was certainly was strange.  He simply couldn't figure her out, one minute she was ready to kill him and the next she was asking for his help. Those things didn't matter how as he heard his grandfather calling out for him to come to practice.
<br />

<br />
"Hurry up boy! It's time for sword practice!"
<br />

<br />
"My name is Ka......."
<br />

<br />
In a instant Magus was up and running down the hall, leaving the woman sprawled out across the floor with footprints on her face. He enjoyed nothing more than sword practice, it was the only thing he really felt he was good at.  His grandfather knew he had a natural talent for the sword, but also he knew Magus would need a great many skills to survive in life, which is why he insisted on teaching him the hand to hand skills that monks all had to learn.
<br />

<br />
"I'm ready grandfather!"
<br />

<br />
Magus grabbed a hold of his wooden practice sword and took his stance as his grandfather did the same.  Both stood there smiling at each other, one waiting for the other to begin the spar. Neither noticed the young woman who stormed into the room with the fresh foot imprints on her face from Magus, that is until she began mocking the young man's stance.
<br />

<br />
"Your kidding right? I could of sworn you where a better swordsman."
<br />

<br />
"Well young lady if you wish why don't you spar against Magus here.", the old man smiled, he was going to lure her into showing him what she was capable of.
<br />

<br />
"I'd be glad to, and please, call me Kayla."
<br />

<br />
Kayla smirked as the old man tossed her his practice sword, she was going to humiliate Magus infront of his grandfather. She made the first move, lunging forward and aiming the tip of the wooden sword at Magus's ribs.  The tip only connect with air as Magus moved to the side and brought his own practice down across her extended arm.
<br />

<br />
"Ouch that hurt, You jerk!"
<br />

<br />
"Well at least we know I'm a better than you at using a sword."
<br />

<br />
"Oh really?"
<br />

<br />
Kayla moved in to attack again, the sound of wood striking wood was heard as Magus countered her attack.  All the old man could do was smile as he watched the two launch attack after attack at each other.  Neither where gaining much advantage over each other, which pleased the old man greatly.  The least he could do was teach his grandson how to become a great fighter.
<br />

<br />
"I'm surprised, she's a pretty good sword fighter."
<br />

<br />
Magus grandmother smiled as she came through the door way and watch the two spar.  She could tell her grandson had definitely improved since he'd came to stay at the shrine.  Right off it was evident he had a skill for the sword, and whether he knew it or not she could tell his unarmed skills where just as good. Still the fact that the young man constantly held back his talent was disturbing to her.
<br />

<br />
"This spar would done be over if he would just stop holding back", Magus's grandfather sighed.
<br />

<br />
"You mean to tell he's holding back?!", Kayla narrowed her eyes at Magus.
<br />

<br />
The young woman felt insulted, and more so since he was keeping up with her attacks.  There also remained the fact that he had definitely managed to hurt her the previous night. That didn't settle well with her at all.
<br />

<br />
"All right you want to play, fine then I'll just play too!"
<br />

<br />
Kayla giggled and disappeared from sight, leaving Magus gawking and dumbfounded at what just happened. All Magus's grandfather could do was laugh, mainly because this was going to be a practice the young man would never forget. It was then that Kayla's form appeared behind Magus, and then she landed a mana charged fist into his jaw just as he began to turn around to face her.
<br />

<br />
"What the hell was that for?!"
<br />
"That was for making me look like a pushover!"
<br />

<br />
Magus's eyes narrowed as they settled on Kayla, he was gingerly rubbing the whelp left behind from her fist. It was then that his grandfather decided to give the young man some advice.  It was just what he needed to settle the playing field since Kayla had taken the spar to another level.
<br />

<br />
"Magus just keep calm, today's lesson was to teach you how to harness your power."
<br />

<br />
"Like thats going to help me now!"
<br />

<br />
"Okay, then you can figure it out on your own."
<br />

<br />
It didn't take long before Kayla was on the attack again.  It was taking all Magus had to dodge her sword strikes as well as her glowing fists.  He was back up against a wall now and knew the only way he would manage to get out this one would be to try and learn what his grandfather was going to teach him this day.
<br />

<br />
"Okay I'm sorry, just tell me what to do!"
<br />

<br />
"That's simple, just hold out your hands, relax your muscles and stop holding back."
<br />

<br />
"That's all?"
<br />

<br />
Magus flipped backwards, and hand springed away from Kayla, he knew he was going to need some distance.  Kayla just laughed, she couldn't feel him gathering any kind of mana at all, of course she thought he used mana in a similar way that she did.  Her confidence soon faded as a small glowing orb formed infront of the young mans out stretched hands.
<br />

<br />
"You wouldn't..."
<br />

<br />
"Oh yes I would!"
<br />

<br />
The orb exploded into flames and shot forward, landing at the ground infront of Kayla and forming a spiral of flames that engulfed her form. Naturally her wooden practice sword was burnt to a crisp. However, the sight that came next was one that Magus would never forget.
<br />

<br />
"You jerk you just burnt all my clothes!"
<br />

<br />
Kayla made a feeble attempt at covering herself, the flames had indeed burnt her clothes away and left her standing nude infront of everyone. All Magus could do was stare, and all his grandmother could do was cover his grandfathers eyes. Needless to say the old man was laughing.
<br />

<br />
"Well you certainly do have a way of messing things up, might I suggest running?"
<br />

<br />
"Uh huh..."
<br />

<br />
Magus wasn't paying any attention at all to what his grandfather said.  He did pay attention to the fact that his grandmother had tossed a robe to Kayla, who in a frenzy wrapped the clothing around herself.  That was his que to run, which he did as fast as he could out of the room with Kayla in hot pursuit.
<br />

<br />
"Come back here! I'm gonna make you pay for that one!"
<br />

<br />
"I'm flat broke can you put it on my tab?!"
<br />

<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />

<br />
Cain smiled, he had been working many years on this project.  He'd gotten the idea from the Exodus sword he had been responsible for creating, and it was astounding.  A sentient suit of armor, he had dreamed it and had worked many years to bring it into existence, or rather the crystal that would create it.
<br />

<br />
"So, what do you wish to be called?"
<br />

<br />
The crystal simply pulsed a few times in the vat of solution infront of Cain.  At first glance it just seemed like a pendant, but the material it was made of was like nothing the world had seen before.  The old man had no idea just what the armor it could summon was capable of.  The ancient text he studied mentioned something of some sort of evil King of the undead having a metal armor of unimaginable power.
<br />

<br />
"Well my friend, what should I call you?"
<br />

<br />
- Cy.......rus..... -
<br />

<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />

<br />
"Now I got you!"
<br />

<br />
"AHHHH!"
<br />

<br />
Magus screamed as he was tackled to the ground, sure enough Kayla had caught him and now he was at her mercy, or would have been had not her robe came open, giving the young man a stunning show.
<br />

<br />
"Yep, those are real!"
<br />

<br />
"How dare you!"
<br />

<br />
Kayla slapped Magus as hard as she could, leaving a red whelp across his cheek as she fumbled to close the robe again. With that Magus shoved her off and scrambled to his feet, dashing for the doorway. Much to his surprise he ran face first into the breastplate of none other than a guard from Qeynos.
<br />

<br />
"I'm here to take you in Magus."
<br />

<br />
"What is the meaning of this?"
<br />

<br />
Magus's grandfather stepped out into view, he wasn't very fond of the Qeynos guards.  Of course from past experience they where not fond of the old man either.  To this day the new recruits are told stories of just what the old shrine keeper was capable of in a battle.
<br />

<br />
"This young man was caught in the young lady Bayles room last evening."
<br />

<br />
"Is that so? Are you certain it was him?"
<br />

<br />
"We have arrested anyone who fits the description, the young lady intends to pick the one who broke into her room out from the group."
<br />

<br />
"I see, well then instead of you taking him why don't you go on about your business and tomorrow we'll come to town. You see he still has chores to do around the temple here."
<br />

<br />
"I must insist that he come with me..."
<br />

<br />
The old man glared at the guard with an icy stare. Not many guards had the nerve or the guts to come out to the temple.  However the ones that did had a bad tendency of believing themselves to be all superior.  It was then that the old man smiled, he had an idea.
<br />

<br />
"Do you remember a story about three fighters who destroyed Crow's Pub many years ago..."
<br />

<br />
"Yes I do, but what does that matter?"
<br />

<br />
"It matters because I was one of the three who did that..."
<br />

<br />
The guard stared wide eyed at the elder man before him, he couldn't believe what he heard.  Surely anyone with that kind of strength could easily handle himself and several other guards still even for being an old man.  It was then that guard decided to make his decision.
<br />

<br />
"Fine, come to the city tomorrow..."
<br />

<br />
At that the guard rushed out of the temple, scared for his life. The reason being was that the three fighters where said to have been demons.  Perhaps some sort of monster, but that was the rumors at least, and today was the day he didn't want to find out if they where true or not.
<br />

<br />
"Well Magus, it looks like your in more trouble than you bargained for..."
<br />

<br />

<br />
What does fate have in store for Magus, and more importantly what is this mysterious armor hidden by the power of the crystal calling itself Cyrus? If you want to find out more keep on reading folks, and yes I know I'm writing slow.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

Chapter 3
<br />

<br />
"The Burning Sword, A Demon's Rage."
<br />

<br />
As is usual with the beginning of any chapter I have to write a little something or other. Well as usual I've had my fair share of ups and downs, I mean after all its not easy having a 50+ monk.  But to all you monks out there learn something. Power without perception is virtually worthless and of no true value.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Magus banged a metal pan against the bars of his cell, he couldn't believe it.  The wench had picked him out of a line up and worse yet, he was looking at a sentence of life imprisonment or death at the worst.  He could only hope the judges ruling would be different than those two choices tomorrow. At least he didn't have a cell mate to deal with. It didn't take long though for the guards to come to his cell and shove him back from the bars.
<br />

<br />
"You have visitors."
<br />

<br />
Both his grandparents and Kayla had come to see him, of the three though his grandfather was acting odd, he had a smile on his face. The kind that could give anyone the creeps, even the lowest of creatures seemed to sense something as the rats, of two legs and of four scurried further away from them.
<br />

<br />
"Well looks like you've gotten yourself into some real trouble."
<br />

<br />
"He'll be in trouble when he gets out.", Kayla mumbled, she was still upset at him from before.
<br />

<br />
"Thanks for the vote of confidence.", Magus grumbled, he hated this.
<br />

<br />
Of course his lowered spirits changed when his father pulled out the very sword hilt he had used in battle. It looked the same, except it didn't seem as old in some way, almost as if it just forged recently.
<br />
Certainly this was something new to him.
<br />

<br />
"Your father has one similar to this, as does another along with myself."
<br />

<br />
With that Magus visitors left, and soon enough the torches where put out. For some reason Magus felt at home in the darkness or in the light.  Oddly enough he could see everything perfectly which gave the guards the creeps because no pure blooded human was suppose to have perfect night vision. The young man's peace and quiet was interrupted as the sword finally decided to introduce it.
<br />

<br />
- The names Matsume, you even wake there? -
<br />

<br />
- Wonderful, a talking piece of junk -
<br />

<br />
- Well aren't you optimistic, and I'm not a piece of junk -
<br />

<br />
Magus definitely hated all that had happened to him, of course what was he to do? Well at least the sword itself seemed to hold some promise. It was keeping the rats away as well as anything else in the darkness. He was so wrapped up in his thoughts about what were going to happen to him the next day he didn't notice some small figure was unlocking the door to his cell.
<br />

<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />

<br />
All Cain could do was chuckle as he walked away from the jail area. Sure he had caught some heat about what all Magus had done, but after he'd explained just what he was doing both the young lady Bayle and her father understood. Still telling the royalty that this young man was his great grandson wasn't exactly what he had planned, but things where still turning out wonderful.
<br />

<br />
"So my little friend, are you learning more about this world?"
<br />

<br />
He had been carrying the crystal that he himself had created in his laboratory around with him all day. It was his theory that the more it could understand of this world the better it could express itself. Deep down the old man realized that this crystal would serve his great grandson, and his further descendants well.
<br />

<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />

<br />
Through out the castle things seemed quiet, all the royalty where asleep and things seemed to be settling down after the fiasco several days ago from Magus. This was the perfect time for the assassin to strike, or so he thought. His first objective was to kill the Bayle family, the second was to destroy the being his employer's termed "The Spirit Master". This unfortunately was one of his better jobs he thought.
<br />

<br />
He thought it was odd though, why was a simple human they called a Spirit Master so feared. He himself thought of humans as inferior, at least this was his common belief since it was so easy for him to sneak past the guards.
<br />

<br />
Certainly his employer could come up with someone else to do the job just as easily, after all they weren't easily detected. However, he knew that using a hired assassin would better blend in with all that was intended. Still he was puzzled why he was chosen, after all there where far better qualified and more experienced rogues that himself about.
<br />

<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />

<br />
Magus simply yawned and leaned against his cell door, for now Matsume was quiet. At least the sword gave him some comfort since after all he was in the holding area beneath the very same place he had snuck into not long ago. It surprised him that they still considered using such an old jail area, but if even he wasn't able to pick the lock then it must of meant it was still as useful as the day it was constructed.
<br />

<br />
Earlier it hadn't taken long at all for Magus to determine that the locks where tinkered by gnomes. Against normal locks he was a master, but against such gnomish devices he simply didn't have a clue. He still couldn't figure out how his father could unlock them as he had seen him do in the past. 
<br />

<br />
"What in th......."
<br />

<br />
- Serves you right for calling me a piece of junk. -
<br />

<br />
Magus had put his full weight on the door and fell flat on his back when the door moved. Common sense told him that escaping would just get him into deeper trouble if he was caught. On the other hand, he thought it wouldn't hurt to look around just as long as he made it back to his cell without getting caught. It didn't take long for him to make up his mind and he was gone, creeping through the shadows of the castle.
<br />

<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />

<br />
Kayla laughed to herself as she slipped through the shadows of the castle. If she couldn't get Magus back then the least she could do was torment him while he was in his cell, not to mention her curiosity of the world was getting the best of her. This world was far to wondrous than what she remembered from the past. 
<br />

<br />
However, Kayla could sense something was not right in the castle, like a strange presence had invaded the very essence of the building itself. Still she was more curious about the events going on in the castle as she faded through the walls. Every so often she would spot something out of the corner of her eyes in the shadows, for the most part all she could make out where patrolling guards as she neared the cell where Magus was being kept.
<br />

<br />
"He's gone...."
<br />

<br />
Kayla was definitely intrigued now, not only by the fact that Magus was no longer in his cell, but to where he could be heading. A smile crept across her face as an idea dawned on her. It was now obvious to her exactly where Magus was going, he was heading up to the young lady Bayle's room. So that is exactly where she began to slip off to herself. Little did she realize a surprise was laying in wait for both herself, and the young lady.
<br />

<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />

<br />
With hesitation or fear the assassin began to strike down the guards, he always liked this part, it was so fun for him to knock the guards unconscious. After all they would live to be punished for not doing their jobs better. To him this was simple child's play, they never seen him come out or return to the shadows as he made his way to the first room.
<br />

<br />
His plan was simple, first he would kill the young girl, then while the remaining guards found their fellow guards unconscious he could use the resulting confusion to sneak past the more adept guards at the master bedroom. This was a tried and true plan, at least he thought so until he seen a woman come out of the shadows near the young girls door.
<br />

<br />
"Wonderful...."
<br />

<br />
This was definitely an unexpected flaw in his plan, he hadn't been told of any extra guard at the young girls door. He silently cursed himself for not pumping his sources for more information, to make matters worse instead of leaving the woman was leaning up against the door frame. It became obvious he was going to have to at least paralyze her, or at the worst add another victim to his night of blood shed.
<br />

<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />

<br />
"Come on Magus.... Where are you hiding."
<br />

<br />
Kayla thought for sure she could find Magus at the young ladies room. She couldn't believe she could be wrong, or maybe she had simply arrived before he did. She was certain one of the shadows she had seen before was Magus's.
<br />

<br />
 In fact she was so wrapped up in her thoughts she didn't notice the figure out of the corner of her eye, but she did notice the glimmer of cold steel as it traveled through the air and lodged itself firmly in her side. It didn't take long for her to slide down to the floor as her world began to go dim, then shift to complete darkness.
<br />

<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />

<br />
As typical Magus's stomach had lead him to the pantry, and it didn't take him long to find him something quick to eat before he was back to wandering around the castle. He figured if he was going to be out and about at least he should get one last good meal before the book was thrown at him the coming day.
<br />

<br />
Something bothered him though, the castle was unusually quiet, like the guards where all gone or at least off somewhere sleeping. He smiled as he remembered that quite a few times he had run across a sleeping or half asleep guard. Those where fond memories he had of when his father trained him in the arts of stealth, and a couple times he had put the skills to good use as a peeping tom. 
<br />

<br />
Magus soon set his thoughts aside as he came across an unconscious guard, and then another. It became obvious that some intruder was in the castle as he followed the trail fallen guards to an all to familiar area of the castle. Soon he found himself just around the corner from the young lady Bayle's room.
<br />

<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />

<br />
With all the stealth and cunning that he had been hired for the assassin had quickly picked the lock to the young girl's room and had slipped inside. Of course to his dismay he heard footsteps down the hallway. Had he been careless and missed a guard like the one he had just dispatched?
<br />

<br />
The assassin simply shook his head, he couldn't of missed a guard. No one had ever escaped his detection before. He was the absolute best at doing this, no one had even seen him before on his many jobs. Which was glad for since it was the only reason there wasn't a price on his head.
<br />

<br />
The fun was just beginning for him though as he again heard someone moving around outside the room, which made him pause for a moment. It was definitely someone even if it wasn't a guard. This was going to make the job a little more interesting for him he thought.
<br />

<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />

<br />
Something happened to Magus as he rounded the corner and seen Kayla slouched against the wall near the cracked open door. He knew what this meant as he slowly kneeled down beside Kayla. He could tell she was still alive by her breathing. He wondered why she was here in all places and then it dawned on him. Perhaps she had came back to.....
<br />

<br />
Magus quickly dashed those thoughts aside as he stood up, they didn't matter because it was evident to him everything was now his fault. His actions had caused all the events to unfold causing everyone around him to be hurt in some form or other. At least now if he wasn't to late he could repent for at least some of it and save himself in the process as he pushed open the door.
<br />

<br />
A cold chill ran down his spine as he watched the figure poised near the young girl, and then it was replaced with something that wasn't fear. Something he couldn't describe, but compelled him to take a step forward.
<br />

<br />
"So I did miss a guard, I must be getting sloppy..."
<br />

<br />
"Don't even move..."
<br />

<br />
"Oh you plan on doing something to me when your so far away?"
<br />

<br />
A smile once again crept across the assassins face has he turned to face Magus. This was perfect, he could kill all his targets easily he thought, and escape before anyone became obvious. He couldn't of even planned something so perfect.
<br />

<br />
"You know boy, your going to die tonight, you'll end up just like this young girl here, and maybe her friend outside.", the assassin chuckled.
<br />

<br />
It was always a favorite ploy of his, he would first anger someone so they would make the first move. That way he always managed to get in his fatal blows, and leave before he was noticed. Just as he predicted Magus moved forward to strike, only this time his strike with the dagger missed. Somehow, though he couldn't explain it, he had missed, which resulted in him striking out with his fist. 
<br />

<br />
Magus hit the ground hard, he considered himself lucky to have dodged the dagger, but the punch left him dazed and his mind clouded. How could he be so helpless, to let this happen to himself and the people here this night. It was then he wished for some kind of force to help him, he wished for the power to save not only himself, but Kayla as well.
<br />

<br />
- Well your a rather sad sight, I was sure you where stronger than this! -
<br />

<br />
- What do you know? Your just a piece of junk! -
<br />

<br />
- If you want to win just let your mind go. -
<br />

<br />
- Fine, whatever, if I live through this I'll melt you down for scrap though... -
<br />

<br />
Magus thought he had nothing else to lose as he let his mind calm, it was then that he felt a pulling sensation, as if something was pulling at his soul. Whatever it was felt cold, angry, and enraged. Somehow it was similar yet more intense than what he felt before.
<br />

<br />
This was far to easy, or at least the assassin thought as his attention was drawn back to the girl who was in a deep sleep in her bed. However, this was a mistake, as he hadn't noticed the hilt tucked under Magus's belt sparkle for a brief instance. Never the less he made his move as he drove his dagger down towards the girl's heart, only to find it had been stopped by some force. Fear raced though his heart as he glanced down and seen the cause of it.
<br />

<br />
Magus was holding up a single glowing crimson hand, and there was a defined red glow in the centers of his eyes. Whatever this was, it was something that was definitely helping him. With a swift move of Magus's hand the assassin found himself flung back through the doorway and sprawled across the floor in the hall.
<br />

<br />
"So this is why they wanted you dead, your going to pay for that!"
<br />

<br />
Slowly Magus stood to his feet, then he heard a scream as the sleeping girl had awakened to the scene before them. It didn't matter though, Magus was now letting his anger control his actions as he watched the assassin stand and rush toward him with his dagger.
<br />

<br />
Several guards came rushing down the hall as they heard the scream, what they found before them went far beyond what they believed possible. They could only see a blur of movements as what appeared to be two people fought.
<br />

<br />
"It looks like you will be paying instead of me!"
<br />

<br />
The assassin soon found a punch planted across his stomach, which flung him back into the hall and up against the wall with enough force to leave the guards in awe. But it was far from over for the poor soul as once again Magus was on the assault, this time forcing them both out the window down the hallway and into the open yard outside.
<br />

<br />
Needless to say this was a surprise to the guards outside as they seen two people landed on the ground in front of them, and then begin to fight as if they where in a bar room brawl. They could only describe the one person being a demon from the savage way he attacked and the way he moved.
<br />

<br />
It wasn't long before the ground below was drenched in the assassins blood, and may of the guards still wondered how he could still be alive from the punishment they seen him take. Then they seen something most would never forget as Magus crossed his forearms and an incandescent crimson light surrounded his body.
<br />

<br />
In Magus's mind he could seen what he was about to do perfectly, it felt so natural, as if he had seen or done this many times before. Just before he was about to part his arms the Matsume once again spoke to him.
<br />

<br />
- You can't do this here! Think of all the people you'll destroy! -
<br />

<br />
- Shut up! They all deserve this! -
<br />

<br />
- Do they really deserve to die? -
<br />

<br />
The Matsume's words had a somewhat sobering effect on Magus, causing the glow to fade away slowly. Still his anger made his blood boil, he had to do something to make this man pay for doing this to him. It was then that Magus thrust a single hand forward, in it was the Matsume.
<br />

<br />
Night soon became as bright as day as a bright field of light engulfed the yard, finally when the light faded Magus was simply standing, silent. However, the would be assassin was barely clinging to life. His body had been bombarded by what looked like strikes from a flaming sword....

Chapter 4
<br />

<br />
"Shadows from the Past, part 1."
<br />

<br />

<br />
Once again I'm deciding to write another chapter of this slowly progressing, but ever interesting story. Some of you might actually like this one, while others could dismiss it. I'm sure Jet and Raziel are more familiar with this particular person will actually consider this a delightful little twist they had never expected. Anyway without further more to say we begin. (as a side note I've removed the ---- barriers and switched to using just an extra space in their place.)
<br />

<br />

<br />
It had been raining in Freeport for close to two days straight now, but tonight was the far worse than before. Every few minutes there could be seen a flash of light and the sound of crashing thunder in the small pub that several citizen's had taken refuge in. Most of the people where newer faces to the bartender and his waitress, but that was to be expected. After all the weather was horrible, and had taken to being dreadfully cold as well this evening.
<br />

<br />
"Mr. Trass, don't look so down, at least we're having good business tonight.", with that the waitress smiled.
<br />

<br />
Mr. Trass considered Kiri to be his best waitress, and she always chose to work over when the other waitresses got sick. This was the case for the night, still he was slightly worried about the people in the bar. Most particular was a man that was sitting in the corner who had came in earlier. This man was far to quiet, and kept his face hidden beneath cloth constantly.
<br />

<br />
There where also the three other men, who were far to noisy rowdy at one of the tables. In truth he had over heard them speaking about Kiri's appearance.  He had to admit she was an attractive young woman, the only problem was he knew better than to say anything. The last poor soul who hit on Kiri had found themselves in one of the worst street fights he had ever seen with an elderly old man that could only be made out to be one of her relatives.
<br />

<br />
"Say Kiri, why don't you go over and try to talk to our mystery friend there.", Mr. Trass simply nodded his head in the direction of the lone man.
<br />

<br />
The young woman simply did as she was told, sitting down at an empty chair at the mans table. There was something she could sense about him that was sad, as if he was in a great deal of emotional pain. She had always had a way of feeling a small amount of what others sometimes felt. If anything this helped her with the customers and kept them all coming back. This time was different, the feeling was far more intense than she had felt from anyone else.
<br />

<br />
"So Mister why are you so sad?"
<br />

<br />
At that the man simply glanced over at Kiri's eyes then stood up. He slowly made his way to the door, only to throw back a small pouch at her. It was amazingly heavy, and he had intended it to be so, since it was stuffed full with platinum coins. For him money didn't seem to be a matter, if anything it seemed to be a burden.
<br />

<br />
"Your tip for the night young woman...", his voice was strong, and at the same time calm.
<br />

<br />
With that he was out the door before she could say another word, even as she looked through the window she lost track of him as a sheet of rain pelted the panes of the window. The bartender on the other hand wasn't surprised. He had seen the type before, they had no friends, nor seemed to have any family. All they did was travel from place to place doing what ever job suited them, but this one was different...
<br />

<br />
"So she is who my father seems to want captured... I don't quite understand."
<br />

<br />
In truth the man didn't really understand at all, his father was one of the strongest beings to ever grace the face of Norrath. Yet, for him to hold an interest in this girl meant she was probably related to one of his few defeats. For some reason he just couldn't understand why innocent people where victimized by his father. Even as he continued to walk through the rain the girls eyes seemed to haunt his mind, there was something about her that was so odd.
<br />

<br />
Nonetheless he wasn't here to cause anyone any harm, he simply wanted to see the people who had defeated his father. Perhaps then he might understand more of his father and just why he was like he was. Something nagged at the strangers mind, often he had been able to sense who was a genuine threat to people, a kind of foresight to predict when some violent act would occur between people. Tonight it was a feeling about the three men who had been noisily making comments about the waitress.
<br />

<br />
"I suppose I should intervene this one time...", Darkness surrounded the stranger's figure and he simply vanished into the night.
<br />

<br />
"Well Kiri, I think its safe for you to go home now, don't worry about all the cleaning, just head on home."
<br />

<br />
This was the least Mr. Trass could do for Kiri, after all the many times she had picked up the slack around the pub. She was such a sweet girl, always full of joy, as if she hadn't a care in the world. In fact she seemed to care more about others than she did for herself sometimes. What with all the times she had stayed when she should have went home.
<br />

<br />
Still he was worried about the three men he had seen earlier, their where overly interested in Kiri. This is why he had chosen to send her on her way while he suspected the guards would still be out in full force. That was one thing he could count on as well, the Freeport Militia and the Knights of Thunder were always at odds which meant the streets would remain safe for the most part.
<br />

<br />
Kiri was humming as she traveled through the rain, making sure she didn't step in the more deeper of the water puddles that laced the street. In being so carefree she had neglected to notice several people moving about in the shadows behind her. She really didn't have to worry, what with how her parents, and her great uncle were. The memory of her great uncle fighting in the street the one day was still fresh in her mind.
<br />

<br />
She always knew her great uncle was a good fighter in his prime, but as an old man she couldn't believe the strength he had. Sure she had received some training by him personally, since her parents insisted that she learn at least a little self defense. Though she had never really had to of used those skills, everyone who met her seemed to like her. In fact she couldn't remember anyone who actually tried to be mean to her.
<br />

<br />
Tonight that was going to change for her as she felt someone shove her forward, sending her toppling to the wet ground before her. When she finally managed to look back she could make out the figures of three men. Kiri for once was afraid, she had no idea what was happening of what to do now. 
<br />

<br />
"See boss I told ya, she's a sitting duck."
<br />

<br />
"That's right boss, she'll fetch a fine price on the slave market once we get her trained."
<br />

<br />
"Aye, that's my specialty, though if she's good enough I might just keep her for us instead.", the apparent boss of the three smiled down at Kiri.
<br />

<br />
The strange feeling he had gotten was correct, this time though all seemed different for him. Certainly he could just go on, but something was urging him to help now. This scene reminded him of the past, when his mother had been killed. So far in his life he had noticed that no matter the race, if someone is deemed different then they are feared.
<br />

<br />
Tonight was going to be a change for him, perhaps now he could do something and not be persecuted for what he was. He moved in for a closer look and noticed that clearly the young woman wasn't going to be able to defend herself. She was far to scared to even consider doing anything, even her screams wouldn't be heard, mainly because earlier he had noticed the guards where all taking shelter. Now was his time to take action as he appeared from a sheet of rain and stepped between the young woman and the trio.
<br />

<br />
"An who might you be?"
<br />

<br />
"Are you her boyfriend."
<br />

<br />
"No, I'm more of a concerned citizen", there was slight smile on the strangers face.
<br />

<br />
"Why don't you just leave her alone? If you do, I'll let you live."
<br />

<br />
All three laughed at hearing this, for the most part in their many times of doing this they had never had very much trouble. Sure sometimes people like this interrupted them, but usually they ended up as another victim of what looked like a failed robbery. This instance was different though, they hadn't picked this girl at random, someone had asked for her personally, someone who intended to pay a fortune.
<br />

<br />
"I have given you a chance at life, you have refused it...", the stranger reached under his cloak and rested his hand on the hilt of a sword.
<br />

<br />
Kiri could tell this person was serious now, in her mind she thought for certain this was a spy for the Paladins who controlled Northern Freeport. Most of the ones she had met tended to act this way when it came to women, most unlike the Freeport Militia. Something with this person was different as she seen mana begin to surround his body.
<br />

<br />
The stranger pulled his hand away from his sword for a moment, which for the most part confused the three men before him. They couldn't understand just what he was going to try, but the visible appearance of mana around his person was going to make things more difficult. They considered this to be one of the more worrisome parts of the business, since wounds caused by magic often took longer to heal.
<br />

<br />
A Flash of lightning was all it took and the fight was on, in truth he hadn't imagined these people would present much of a problem. That is until he realized they where using weapons he hadn't counted on, in truth they where of a strange enchantment. He had to end this quickly, so he unsheathed his sword and slipped past their attacks, aiming his blade for the weakest of them.
<br />

<br />
Blood soon diluted into the wet puddles on the ground as one of Kiri's assailants fell, having had the strangers sword rammed through his heart. All hopes for her safety soon sank as one of the two remaining men drove his short sword into the side of the stranger. There was no scream, no audible sound that the stranger had been wounded. Soon the stranger found himself struck from behind as the broadsword of the other remaining man ran across his back.
<br />

<br />
In his mind he cursed his luck, he had underestimated them three of them, but at least he had killed one of them for sure. As his sight finally began to black out there was odd feeling in the air, as if he could sense some kind of new power. It felt feral, almost animalistic in nature and yet he wasn't afraid of it as he slipped into the void of unconsciousness.
<br />

<br />

<br />
This was something he despised, since their parents where out of town he had to play baby-sitter for his great nieces. It was no wonder he had gray hair at this age, if anything it was a blessing in disguise since most people never expected what was coming when they fought him. Still tonight of all nights for them to be out late like this, and in the rain at that. At least he could find Kiri easily in the city, given the unique connection he had with his relatives finding her sister wouldn't be very difficult either.
<br />

<br />
To make matters worse he was expecting his grand son to arrive the very same night. In all his years of living he could of never imagined having a family like this. Nevertheless it was comforting to know that they didn't have to suffer as he did during his younger years. Those thoughts where set aside as he neared where he sensed Kiri, he could make out the faint smell of blood in the air through the rain.
<br />

<br />
Instantly he began to mask himself within the shadows as he peered around the corner and witness three men fighting. Soon he found the source of the blood, it was a forth man who lay dead on the ground. Whom ever these men where, it was clearly obvious that some of them had intended to harm Kiri. Of all people, he knew if he waited long enough that one of the sides would win, and then he could take whatever action he thought was necessary.
<br />

<br />

<br />
"Well now that he's done with, how about we take our prize now?"
<br />

<br />
"Most certainly, she'll make sure we'll stay nice an warm tonight with what we have planned for her."
<br />

<br />
All Kiri could do was scream out for help, she didn't want to be taken away by these people, and she certainly didn't think she could handle these two by herself. Off in the distance she heard something, someone breathing heavily, she could feel the anger swelling up in this person. Fear raced through her heart as she felt the emotion building up from this other person, this unbridled rage that she felt was about to consume everything around it.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Now he was certain of what was happening before him, raw power was beginning to flow through very inch of his being as he heard his great niece scream out for help. All he did was take a single step out into plain view, his hands clenched into tight fists. There was a audible snapping as his knuckles made a disgusting cracking sound. Soon enough a crimson aura had surrounded his body, which caused the rain that fell near him to evaporate from the heat it produced.
<br />

<br />
"Hey Boss, looks like we got more company."
<br />

<br />
"Aye it does, an this time its some old man to.", this was very amusing to him to see an old man here as smile graced the slaver.
<br />

<br />
"You fools will die for trying to harm my family, especially my dear great niece here.", he simply pulled back the hood of his cloak as his eyes turned into solid onyx orbs.
<br />

<br />
The weaker of Kiri's remaining two assailants rushed forward, his sword aimed for the old man's chest. It was a futile attempted on his behalf since he found his blade parried to the side with little effort from his opponent. Once again he lashed out to the old man's side this time, only to find his strike to be blocked by a forearm. That was the last thing the man would ever do as he found his sword forcefully pulled from his hands and then darkness filled his world as his own sword was used against him.
<br />

<br />
This was something the old man missed, the carnage of a battle, and this one reminded him of old times as the sword in his hands was shattered over the skull of his advisari. He heard Kiri scream once more  faint, as the man's head seemed to explode from the impact. A smile crossed the old mans face as he looked down at the remains of the blade, then threw them through the air lodging the broken edge into his remaining opponent.
<br />

<br />
As quickly as it had started it was over, the puddles on the street began to turn a crimson color, similar to that of a fine red wine. Even as he hoisted his great niece over his shoulder he still savored the fight he had just had. Still as he turned to look at the wounded man on the street whom had fallen earlier he felt he should do something. With his decision made he shrugged and lifted the man up onto his free shoulder. As he began the walk home he could only wonder just where the other great niece was, and what she was up to.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Kiri came to just as her great uncle entered her house, and before she could say anything she was tossed down to the floor on her rear. For all the times she had been taken care of by her great uncle she always thought of him slightly cruel to most. That was to be expected though since he did put an effort into giving her some lessons in fighting. Still she was puzzled at just why he had brought the stranger who had protected her home with them.
<br />

<br />
"This person protected you did he not?"
<br />

<br />
"Yes, he tried to at least."
<br />

<br />
"Then since you can't seem to fight worth a damn, your going to take care of him, at least until he's well."
<br />

<br />
"I understand...", Kiri felt horrible now as she watched her great uncle take the unconscious man into the other room.
<br />

<br />
She did her best to gather some spare bandages her parents kept in the house, then made her way into the room. At least it was her that he was laying on rather than her brother's or her sister's, after all her sister was probably already on her way home, and her brother was suppose to come back home soon for a tournament. Soon enough she heard her great uncle leave the house as she began to unravel the soaked cloths of the man before her.
<br />

<br />
Kiri had a rough idea of where the wounds where, though it was best to make sure there wasn't something else she would have to care for later. A surprise came to her as she managed to pull the cloth away and uncover the man's face. She was amazed at how handsome this man was, further removal of his garments only proved this. Not only was he good looking, but his muscles where extremely well defined, proof that he had been through a great deal of training.
<br />

<br />
What was before her was a mystery though, the wound on his side only appeared to be a scratch at best now, but she had clearly seen blood earlier. Even the cloth she removed showed signs of heavy bleeding, but now there was no flowing blood. The only real evidence that remained of him being injured where the deep scratch like marks, and the torn blood soaked shirt.
<br />

<br />
All she could do was hastily cover up the marks with the bandages, she wasn't quite sure what her sister or great uncle would do if they seen him in this shape now. Once she was finished though she couldn't help but stare at him. His hair was a deep brown, though she wasn't quite certain what color his eyes where since he hadn't given her the chance to look earlier. There was just something strange about him, like he was somehow more different than his appearance gave away.
<br />

<br />
"Staring isn't polite..."
<br />

<br />
"I'm....... I'm..... I'm sorry.", Kiri felt her face flush as it turned red from embarrassment.
<br />

<br />
"Where am I, and how did I get here?"
<br />

<br />
"Well your at my home, an my great uncle brought you here."
<br />

<br />
"Since it seems I'm a guest here in your home, I'll introduce myself. My name is Alexander, but you may call me Alex."
<br />

<br />
"My name is Kiri, its a pleasure to meet you..."
<br />

<br />
Alex sat up in the bed, taking the time to let his eyes adjust to their surroundings. It was clear this was a woman's bedroom. For the most part it was tidy, and well kept, also it had a warm feeling to it, which made it seem a little better. He was glad though, at least it wasn't anything associated with cleric's or paladin's, which he had good reason to avoid.
<br />

<br />
"This might alarm you Kiri, but I'll be forward with you I'm not exactly what I appear to be."
<br />

<br />
"I guessed as much from the way your wounds appeared."
<br />

<br />
For a second he smiled at her, and the sight before her sent chills up her spine. She had never actually seen someone like Alex before, and in fact most people feared people like him. For some reason she wasn't afraid, just startled at the fact of what he really was. Anyone else in her position would have went into hysterics by now, but rather than that she backed away, not wanting to give anything to chance.
<br />

<br />
"Your a vampire?"
<br />

<br />
"Not exactly, I'm only part vampire, you see my mother was a human."
<br />

<br />
"So why would what make you take a chance like before, as well as even coming to this city?"
<br />

<br />
"Well in a sense I'm stuck playing baby-sitter, my little brother and our sister are somewhere in this city."
<br />

<br />
"So the reason you where at the pub was you where searching for them?"
<br />

<br />
"Yeah, my little brother tends to get into trouble, so that's the first place I go looking."
<br />

<br />
"Oh, I forgot to thank you for helping me..."
<br />

<br />
"I would think we're even now."
<br />

<br />
"So where would you expect your sister to be?"
<br />

<br />
"I'm not totally sure, this is the first time she ever really came to a big city."
<br />

<br />
"Well you can stay here for the night if you like."
<br />

<br />
"Thank you..."
<br />

<br />
Alex laid back once again in the bed, wondering what mischief his little brother and his sister could be into tonight. After all their curiosity always had got the better of them, no matter where they were. At least now he could have a decent nights rest if luck was with him. Little did Alex or Kiri know what else the night would hold for them though...
<br />

<br />

<br />
More twisted idea's are coming from my mind folks, and some unexpected surprises are in store, besides I'm pretty sure everyone will like this...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

Chapter 5
<br />

<br />
"Shadows from the Past, part 2."
<br />

<br />

<br />
Well here we are again folks, I'll clarify some things for everyone at this point in time. For one I write each chapter as they come to me. This might seem odd, but in actuality it seems to keep the story fresh so to speak. Also some people will notice some oddities or people or places that seem out of place. What can I say they're simple mistakes that I miss, after all I'm only human. Well here we go, prepare to be launched into chaos once again.
<br />

<br />

<br />
This weather was horrible, all the night life had practically dried up since the rain had started. Sure she seen people at the pubs and bars that normally would she would never see there. Of course this wasn't exactly a good thing since the guards also took shelter there as well. All this meant she couldn't get into her usual fights or arguments which was one of the things she really enjoyed.
<br />

<br />
All the bartenders and waitresses knew her well, in fact they did just about anything to keep her from getting into a fight. After all, she had been kicked out of the monks guild, mainly because she slugged it out with her instructor which left him bedridden for close to a week. Still even with this kind of reputation most of the waitresses tended to appreciate it when she would stop by. Especially since she had a nasty habit of getting into fights with hecklers, and the occasional "touchy feely" type of men.
<br />

<br />
This particular night she decided it was best to stay away from the pub her sister worked at as she made her way into a densely packed tavern. In truth the two seemed to be more or less opposites, and people couldn't believe the two where actually twins. Nevertheless, they knew who her family was and the kind of trouble they could cause if upset. To make matters worse was the fact that a tournament was going to be held soon, which was only proving to draw out the kinds of people she liked to fight.
<br />

<br />
"How you doing tonight Cara? Have a trouble?"
<br />

<br />
"It's been quiet lately Rina, no scum bags or anything."
<br />

<br />
Cara had been one of her friends since they where children, which often meant Rina would come visit her while she was working at the tavern. In fact Cara was thankful for this, since on more than one occasion Rina had gotten rid of some of her less that favorable patrons. All in all this worked out fine for the barkeep, with Cara's friend coming around he didn't have to invest in nearly as many bouncers as his competitors.
<br />

<br />
A quick survey of the room revealed nothing special for her, there were just the typical customers. With that she decided to take a seat at the only empty table in the place. All Rina was going to do was sit and wait for someone to do or say something wrong, then she'd have the fight she was looking for. Though she knew her great uncle would most likely end up dragging her home, but until then she was going to be searching for some excitement.
<br />

<br />

<br />
The young man couldn't believe his luck, he wasn't able to find anything to do in this city since the raining had started. Sure he had been to a couple places and looked around, but nothing was of any interest here. Though he was grateful that his usual problems with any sort of trouble hadn't shown up yet. In fact where ever he went trouble tended to follow him so even as odd as it was, this break was more than appreciated.
<br />

<br />
His luck began to change as he stepped into a tavern, and much to his surprise there was actually a place to sit. Though he thought it was quite odd that everyone took a glance back at him when he took a seat across from the tables sole occupant, then went about their business. Past experiences just told him to keep quiet and keep everything except his eyes hidden from prying eyes.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Rina couldn't believe someone actually had the gall to sit down at her table, though from the looks of it he seemed harmless. In fact to her he looked like a drifter with the way his cloak and other cloths appeared. As fate would have it her attention was drawn away as a fight broke out at a table in front of her. Now she had the perfect chance to get the fight she wanted, in which she sprang on instantly as she entered the fray.
<br />

<br />
All manner of insults, cursing and the like could be heard from all the parties involved in the fight. Instantly the other patrons dove for cover, even the bartender and Cara took cover as tables and chairs began to take flight. The only person remaining at their seat was the drifter who had entered, in fact nothing that was launched his way had managed to hit him. For the most part the bartender and Cara thought he was nuts to stay in his seat.
<br />

<br />
The young man simply thought of this as the usual trouble following him as he stood from his seat and turned to walk away. What he hadn't counted on was the fact that Rina was launched at him and he had no choice, but to catch her. With his luck though his hands landed on a part that no one even dared touch on Rina. In turn all the remaining people of the tavern could do where look on as they realized just what was about to happen.
<br />

<br />
"Sir you better run while you can!", Cara ducked back behind the bar, she knew all to well what could happen.
<br />

<br />
In fact Cara had seen what happened when someone touched Rina in the wrong way, that was just what landed her instructor in the cleric's guild for treatment. This, she knew, was not going to be a pretty sight at all. Even the few guards that had been in the tavern had rushed out after having seen the scene before them. They had seen just what her great uncle was capable of and where certain that she could probably cause close to the same damage.
<br />

<br />
"Let go of me... You pervert!", Rina was definitely angry now, far more so than anyone had ever seen before.
<br />

<br />
"Sorry! I didn't mean to...", all he could do was duck as he turned to punch him.
<br />

<br />
Somehow he had managed to avoid her first attack, much to everyone's surprise, an before she could launch another he was already, rushing for the door. With that the chase was on as Rina followed in close pursuit. She was now determined to make him sorry he had ever seen her now as they rain down the rain soaked street. At this point all the guards had cleared out of the way, they definitely knew by the look in Rina's jade eyes that she was enraged beyond anything they had ever seen before.
<br />

<br />
This seemed about usual, just as he would manage to relax, some sort of trouble would happen. Though this time it most definitely wasn't his fault. He was amazed at just how fast she was though, she had somehow managed to keep up with him through all this. It was now apparent he had probably angered one of the people who where going to enter the up coming tournament. Furthermore he couldn't use any of his abilities out in the open like this, otherwise he would have more than just this girl on his hands to deal with.
<br />

<br />
Suddenly it dawned on him as he raced past an darkened tunnel, it was the perfect place to get away from her and he could use all his powers. The only down side it was the sewers, which didn't settle well with him at all. This was his only chance though to at least escape, so he took it, running head on into the darkness before him. He was counting on the fact that his night vision was far superior to hers, or so he thought.
<br />

<br />
Rina absolutely hated the sewers, especially after she dealt with several unsavory Shadow Knight's before. Though that didn't deter her from following this young man at the moment, after all, if she didn't get him they probably would. She was puzzled though as she seen him navigate through the tunnels, it was clear he had excellent night vision, of course so did she.
<br />

<br />
"Can't we just talk this out?!", he hoped that this would at least stop her for awhile.
<br />

<br />
"No we can't you damned Pervert! You shouldn't of grabbed them to begin with!", Rina watched as her prey disappeared from her sight.
<br />

<br />
"I do have a name, its Ash, and I'm not a pervert."
<br />

<br />
"I don't care what your name is! Your still a pervert!"
<br />

<br />
Rina's eyes searched the area for him, she simply couldn't understand what Ash was. She could tell by his appearance in the tavern he wasn't exactly a proficient user of magic. Not only that but he had been able to run so fast which was more evidence to show that she was dealing with more of a close combat fighter.
<br />

<br />
Ash had always heard that redheads had foul tempers, and stubborn but this one was proving to be far worse than any stereotype he had heard. Most notable was she was visibly searching for him, which made moving for him that much worse. After all using an illusion like the one he was using now was difficult to say the least. He was going to have to make his move soon, or else she would definitely catch him.
<br />

<br />
Rina turned around just as Ash leapt out of the shadows after her, there was a loud splash as the two of them landed in the water. She couldn't believe it not only had he managed to sneak up on her, but he now had her pinned down. Of course she wasn't going to stand for this one bit as she began to struggle to release herself. Which of course had very little effect on Ash's grip, he certainly wasn't going to let her go just yet.
<br />

<br />
"Will you just listen now? All that back there was an accident."
<br />

<br />
"Like hell it was! Your a pervert plain and simple!"
<br />

<br />
"If I was such a person I'd be trying to grab you right now rather than talk some sense into you."
<br />

<br />
"Take this you bastard!", with that she rammed a knee into Ash's groin.
<br />

<br />
It had been a long time since anyone had really managed to hit him, and it took all he had just to back away from her. Ash simply couldn't believe she had done that, further more he couldn't believe he was able to stand either. He had now had enough to trying to talk to her as he looked for a quick escape away from the situation.
<br />

<br />
In a split second he managed to avoid a flying kick from Rina, as well as scramble into through a opening in the grating of a nearby tunnel. If anything this would keep her at bay while he thought up a new plan on how to get out of all this. Usually when he needed to get out of trouble with women he could appeal to their vanity, in this case it was a definite bad idea. She didn't appear to be the money hungry type either, so that left bribery out as well.
<br />

<br />
"Wait until I get my hands on you!", Rina did her best to try and reach through the metal grating at Ash.
<br />

<br />
"Now who sounds like a pervert?", he couldn't help but snicker at this scene before him.
<br />

<br />
"That's it!!!"
<br />

<br />
Before Ash could do or say another thing he heard the straining of metal and the cracking of stone as Rina began to pull on the grate. She was doing something he thought was impossible for a woman to do as he seen her tear the grating free and throw it aside as if it where a piece of parchment. All he could do was try to avoid her attacks one after another. This was turning out more worse than he could of expected.
<br />

<br />

<br />
There remained to be a few problems the both of them neglected, for one fighting in the sewers leaves no way for escape. Another is that more often then not your discovered by one of the many Shadow Knights that travel the passages, as well as the occasional undead that where associated with them. In this case the later applied as several of the aforementioned heard the fight and took it upon themselves to find out more.
<br />

<br />
It was simple enough, or so the two Shadow Knights thought as the neared the fighting. They could simply send in some undead creatures to do their dirty work, then go in and do whatever they wanted. After all they weren't to proud to rob the armor off of corpses if it would further them along in their quests for power.
<br />

<br />
"Go and kill, bath in their blood...", with that one of the shadow knight's pointed a hand towards the sounds of the fight.
<br />

<br />
The reanimated corpses simply headed down the tunnel toward the where their master had sent them. Most of the undead where several homeless people who had drowned in the sewers due to the flooring from the last couple days of rain. The others where composed of several lesser ghouls, which although not smart, always presented problems to anyone they where ordered to attack.
<br />

<br />

<br />
This was bad, Ash just knew it was from the feeling he got as he continued to avoid Rina's assault. When it came to sensing undead he could of been considered one of the best, mostly due to the blood that flowed through his veins. Most of the time it tended to be more of a curse, rather than an actual gift since it meant one of his family where coming for him. These he could tell where definitely not family, which distracted him just enough for Rina to slip in a quick punch to his face.
<br />

<br />
"Finally I got ya! Now stay still so I can do it again!", she once again drew her fist back, ready to attack.
<br />

<br />
She wouldn't have the chance to do it again though as several zombies pounced on her from the shadows. Now Rina was beginning to wonder if this Ash fellow was really worth all this trouble, even if he had grabbed her back in the tavern. She decided to put her revenge on hold as she sent the zombies flying to the walls one by one.
<br />

<br />
It was simple enough to Ash to hide himself from the zombies, still it wasn't exactly fair of him to do such either. He was more than use to close quarters fighting, but he tried to avoid that at all costs. This time was different though, in this case it was more or less putting them out of a forced existence of misery and torment. He really didn't have any other choice as he batted a zombie away, sending it sprawling into the water.
<br />

<br />
"How about we settle this once we handle our friends here. Is that okay Miss?"
<br />

<br />
"Once I'm done with these your next, that's a promise! An the name is Rina, got that?"
<br />

<br />
This was enough of a distraction for one of the lesser ghouls to pounce from the shadows and tear the cloth covering Ash's face away. Now she was definitely puzzled, from what she seen he had no reason to hide his face, in fact if Cara would have seen it earlier she would have probably given him a free drink. It was then that strands of mana began to flow through the air as they collected into field around his body. Rina began to wonder, if he had this kind of talent then why hadn't he used it on her before.
<br />

<br />
He had never intended to for her to see his face, after all if someone could see his face then they could also see else was trying to hide. That didn't matter now as he slid a several daggers from under his cloak and sent them flying into the several of the zombies, as well as the lesser ghoul that had attacked him. At that he held out his hands as the intensity of the mana surrounding his body began to build, he was now ready to end their torment.
<br />

<br />
Rina heard shrieks come from behind her as she turned to see just what was going on. What she seen simply amazed her as streams of mana had stretched from Ash's hands and attached to the daggers firmly embedded in each undead surrounding him. As abruptly as the shrieks began they stopped as lifeless husks fell to the ground, their accursed and tormented souls once again at rest.
<br />

<br />
Not to be outdone by Ash she took a stance, as she prepared to use one of the many techniques her great uncle had shown her. In fact he had said it was specifically created to deal with the very problem they where now faced with, which happened to be an unknown number of undead. Little did she realize that an unsuspected problem was about to arise from the mistake she was about to make.
<br />

<br />
"Soul Reactance!"
<br />

<br />
A massive force of white light erupted from her hands and spread through the ranks of undead around her. The howls of the tormented souls soon filled the air as body after body fell to the ground, the life it once held gone as its own soul was used to attack the next undead creature near it. Then the unexpected happened as the force converged on Ash, next to be followed by his screams of agony.
<br />

<br />
This was totally surprising to Rina now as she watched, the brilliance of light as it swirled around Ash's form. She couldn't understand what she had done wrong, she had done everything correct, just as her great uncle had said. Then she found the reason why as she looked closer at his face, grim reality soon dawned on her as she realized the attack had done specifically what it was meant to do.
<br />

<br />
The agony of hundreds and thousands of souls assaulted Ash's mind as he felt his very life being torn from his body. It was taking all his concentration and will just to keep his very existence intact as he struggled through the onslaught. In the back of his mind he was sensing something as it was approaching them. Something that was consumed in the darkness was heading towards them and he couldn't fight now.
<br />

<br />

<br />
This was clearly disappointing for the Shadow Knights as the both of them neared where they heard the screaming. Their puppets had most likely failed them since neither could sense them anymore. Though neither where prepared for what they seen before their eyes as they reached their prey. They had never seen anything like it, the way the light was shifting around this persons form. Still they where intent on getting what they could as they came out of the darkness, weapons ready.
<br />

<br />

<br />
She seen the two armored figures come forward from the darkness and couldn't do anything, she was frozen with fear. Rina was scared, because she had never intended to do this to another person. Her great uncle had always told her that she would know which people should not exist in this world, that she would be able to tell eventually.
<br />

<br />
In his mind Ash thought he was surely done for, that is, until the two armor clad individuals past him and began to head straight for Rina. It was then that he had an idea about what to do, mainly of how to free himself, and how to get rid of these two in the process. He was certain that these two had commanded the undead that attacked them, which meant that the souls that where attacking him now held more hatred for these two than him.
<br />

<br />
Rina finally seen Ash move, even though he was still being assaulted by the spirits that had been unleashed. Soon the white mass shifted from him to the two Shadow Knights as he reached out and touched them. The result was a blinding flash of white light that filled the sewers for a moment and then it was gone. The souls had sated their rage for not being allowed to pass on by devouring the very people who had forced them to exist past their time.
<br />

<br />

<br />
The old man reminded himself that he would chew Rina's parents out for asking them to watch her. In truth it was like dealing with himself again sometimes. Still even for all that had happened he managed to find out where she had been, or at least signs of her handy work as he trudged through the sewers. All he did was spit on the ground as he kicked the two empty suits of armor that lay before him as he realized she was already on her way home.
<br />

<br />
It was interesting to him, as he looked at round and noticed several pieces of cloth. She must of been into some kind of fight to cause all the destruction he seen here. It was obvious his lessons had benefited her, and that she showed signs of improvement since her last time with him. Though he still couldn't understand just what had been done to totally evaporate the two bodies that had occupied the armor. He knew she didn't have that kind of power yet, and doubted she would ever intentionally try to gain it either.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Rina didn't know why she was doing this, after all she wanted to smash his face in when she met him, and still wanted to. Of course she knew that neither her nor Ash could exactly fight after the incident that just happened. In a sense he had saved her, but even if he did, she was still going to get him back once they had rested some.
<br />

<br />
"This doesn't mean that we're friends, I'm just doing this so you can't get away."
<br />

<br />
"Looks like more trouble for me in the future then....", Ash couldn't help but mumble hearing that.
<br />

<br />
The two had managed to help each other stand as they made their way down the street like a couple of drunks. Ash smiled for a moment, least now she couldn't hit him, mainly because if she tried they'd both fall and probably be stuck on the ground for awhile. Little did he realize that she was keeping an eye on him as they made their way down the street, and his secret was now fully uncovered with his smile.
<br />

<br />
"I should have known you where a blood sucker."
<br />

<br />
"Well I'm not, I'm only part blood sucker thank you very much."
<br />

<br />
"Wise guy too I see."
<br />

<br />
Well she was thankful that at least he had somewhat of a charming personality, and he wasn't all that bad as she thought back on it. He'd probably put up a better fight once they both got some rest, though she was unsure of what her sister would say for bringing him home with her. Sure her sister was kind, but she had never brought home anyone of the opposite sex before, which tended to raise some rumors. Though she made sure to stifle them at the source, which lead to some of her many fights she had been in.
<br />

<br />
She quickly brought her thoughts to the present as she pushed open the door to her house, only to see something she hadn't expected. A quick inspection showed some recent wet footprints, and the sight of wet cloths outside her sisters room was something surprising. Rina looked at the cloths for a minute, then to the cloths on Ash and realized they both had the same style.
<br />

<br />
"Looks like we have another guest here, wonder who it is."
<br />

<br />
"As if my luck couldn't get any worse..."
<br />

<br />
This was all he needed, he recognized the shirt that lay on the floor easily, it was his brother's. Though he wasn't exactly sure he should tell Rina, who knows what would happen if she got mad now. Ash's plans on keeping Rina in the quiet about who was here though.
<br />

<br />
"Kiri! Just who else is here!!!"
<br />

<br />

<br />
There you have it folks, chapter 5, and just wait chapter 6 is soon to come, with a slightly mild yet interesting tone that most will enjoy.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>
