Chapter 1
<br />

<br />
"The Reunion"
<br />

<br />

<br />
For everyone who's become a fan of my first story, I'll just say this is a preview of the next one.  This by no means determines the exact depth or impact of the last story's end.  Anyway I hope you enjoy this.
<br />

<br />

<br />
It has been 16 years since the Shoken and his friends faced quite possibly the greatest threat that Norrath ever faced.  In that time the world has been at peace, everything has remained in balance.  It is now that our story begins, in the bustling port town of Qeynos.
<br />

<br />
A young red haired boy ran down the street, his hair tied back into a pony tail, it wasn't unusual to see him, after all he lived in this city with his parents and his grandfather, but this day would be the day that his life would change forever as the boy ran around a corner and rushed into his grandfathers house.
<br />

<br />
"Grandpa why'd you send for me?"
<br />

<br />
"Well m'boy its time for you to earn the right to the special training you've been wanting.  Take this package and don't open it until nightfall, inside is a note describing your task."
<br />

<br />
"Okay grandpa!"
<br />

<br />
The boy took the note and rushed out of the house, all the old man could do was shake his head and think of how he reminded him of his own son, tonight would definitely be a test of his mettle.
<br />

<br />
Just down the street two cloaked figures entered a house, both where clearly familar with this city, and with the house they where entering, as well as the greeting the recieved as they came into the house.  A loud metallic bong was heard and then cursing.
<br />

<br />
"What the hell did I do this time?!"
<br />

<br />
"I told you to keep Zenki home today! Don't you remember? Today is the special day!"
<br />

<br />
"Well Shoken I see you and Azia haven't changed."
<br />

<br />
"It's just like old times isn't it dear?"
<br />

<br />
The two cloaked figures pulled back their hoods, it was Zolf and Zinka.  Today was the day that they met each year, both to catch up on events as well as to discuss if they should intervene in any of the worldly events to prevent anything like what happened sixteen years ago.
<br />

<br />
"Well the reason we're here so earily is our daughter is in town, she just finished some of her training in Erudin."
<br />

<br />
"Oh, thats right, I seen Leona heading towards the inn eariler today, anyway the reason Zenki's not here, is because my father has decided to begin training him."
<br />

<br />
"Oh.... I'm sorry about the pan then."
<br />

<br />
Zinka laughed, Azia had always been strict when it came to keeping Shoken in line.  Though sometimes it amazed her that Shoken could survive all the abuse, but then again with what he'd been through it was surprising to see him alive, let alone working as a blacksmith.
<br />

<br />
"Anyway we have a small favor to ask of you two, as of late it seems that Leona is having trouble finding a suitable suitor."
<br />

<br />
"Actually none of them want to even get involved with her since Zolf nearly incinerated the last one."
<br />

<br />
"And I take it you think Zenki is husband material for her."
<br />

<br />
"He's to much like his father and grandfather, he can't seem to stay out of trouble."
<br />

<br />
The four continued to talk about the possible engagement, while across the city Leona had just came back to her room from buying some supplies.  She was cross training in every class she could.  After all it was her parents wish that she learn all that she could, what amazed her even more was that all the guilds she had been to had agreed upon this.
<br />

<br />
Zenki smiled as he watched the sun set, he then promptly tore open the package his grandfather had given him, inside was a full suit of gnome skin armor, and a note.  The instructions where explicit and to the point.  He was go into the inn, go into room 32, take whatever clothing he could find, and return it to his grandfather before midnight.  For sure this was an easy task, or so he thought.
<br />

<br />
"Well if thats what he wants then I guess thats what I have to get."
<br />

<br />
No more than a half hour later Zenki was in his pitch black armor and had just picked the locks to the room, it was odd, this was a private room, it even had its own bath set aside for it.  As he looked around he couldn't see any clothing at all, so much for his easy task.
<br />

<br />
Leona had decided to relax and soak in the bath that came with her room, it was times like this that she enjoyed having rich parents, she could throw her cloths all over the place and not worry about a thing or so she thought.
<br />

<br />
Zenki slowly edged open the door to the bath area, one thing he'd learned was how to turn himself invisible, but it was odd, he didn't have to use a spell to do so, but who was he to complain about such a gift since it was just what he needed now as he eased his way through the steam filled room.  Of course he wasn't counting on what happened next.
<br />

<br />
Leona stared down at the water and noticed a slight glimpse of a shadow across it, someone was in there with her and was invisible, as second later she had cast see invisible on herself, what she seen was some guy in a pitch black suit reaching for some of the new armor she'd just bought, it didn't take her long to turn around and scream while sending a fireball at the theif.
<br />

<br />
"Stop! Theif!"
<br />

<br />
"Holy sh...."
<br />

<br />
Before Zenki could finish the sentence he was flung backwards by the fireball and bounced off the wall, landing on his hands and knee's.  He'd blown it, now he was going to have to escape, and grab anything he could in the process.  He reached out blindly and grabbed whatever clothing he could and bolted out of the room.
<br />

<br />
"Stop! Pervert!"
<br />

<br />
Leona jumped out of the water and grabbed her remaining clothes, rushing to slip the last of them on as she tripped over her own feet, through the doorway and landing in the hallway.
<br />

<br />
"Why me, its not me fault honest!"
<br />

<br />
"Tell that to my fireballs you bastard!"
<br />

<br />
Leona chased Zenki out of the inn and into the street sending fireball after fireball at him.  Much to her surprise he was able to avoid them. All the while scaling the side of a builting and running across its roof, it didn't take Leona long to reach the roof though and the pursuit was on again.
<br />

<br />
"Wonderful, she's stuck on me like a fly to....."
<br />

<br />
Zenki hadn't been paying attention and fell through a hole in a roof.  His surprise lay at the bottom, it was the public baths, and much to his horror it was the womens section, screams and shouts of a dozen nude women ranging from high elves to barbarians who began throwing whatever they could get their hands on as well as casting whatever spells they could on him.
<br />

<br />
Leona gasp as she seen Zenki blasted through the main doors to the baths and out into the street, only to be followed by towel clad women who promptly began to chase him down the street, Leona taking the lead.
<br />

<br />
"Lets skin him alive, right ladies?!"
<br />

<br />
Cheers and shouts of approval rang though the air from the women as Zenki ran as fast as his feet could carry him down the street.  Suddenly he had an idea, it was a long shot but he thought it could work.  All he'd have to do was buy himself some time to prepare for the ability he was going to use, certainly he'd seen his father do it more than once, and he knew the basics behind it, it was just a simple use of a powder that was used in flares, but still it was a long shot and Zenki found the perfect place to test this out as he came face to face with a dead end.
<br />

<br />
"Okay I'm sorry! Honest! It wasn't my fault! By the way are those real?"
<br />

<br />
The women roared in anger, all the while Leona held back a snicker, at least he was funny, even if he was about ready to die at all their hands. But she knew there must be a reason he was stalling, what was it.  She would soon find out.
<br />

<br />
"Hey look its Antonius Bayle!"
<br />

<br />
Zenki raised his hands into the air, and a bright flash of light blinded the angry mob, this was all he needed as he rushed past them all and towards his grandpa's house, where naturally his grandpa was waiting out in front.
<br />

<br />
"So boy did you get the items?"
<br />

<br />
"Here catch!"
<br />

<br />
Zenki had tossed him a set of womens underwear and a bra, he hadn't really paid attention to what he grabbed in the room, but now he knew why he was being chased down like a dog.  Leona had just regained her vision and was tracking Zenki's foot prints when she seen him running for a house.  She was going to roast him like a chicken for sure.
<br />

<br />
"Where is that boy?!"
<br />

<br />
"I told you he was to much like his father, always late, probably getting into more trouble as we speak."
<br />

<br />
"Well dear thats all right, Leona gets into her fair share of trouble too."
<br />

<br />
Zenki rushed through the door and backed up against it, barring it with his body just as Leona rushed the door, determined to break it down.  What a find mess he'd gotten himself into, and it didn't look like it was going to get any better as he was struck over the head with a pan.
<br />

<br />
"Where have you been Zenki?! And Who's that outside?!"
<br />

<br />
"I've been running an errand for grandpa, and thats some crazy woman out there trying to kill me."
<br />

<br />
"Open the door you little pervert or I'll blast it down!"
<br />

<br />
Zolf and Zinka both looked at each other, was it really Leona's voice they had heard?  No it couldn't of been, she should be at the inn ready to meet them and not out on the street, but soon they found themselves corrected as Azia tugged Zenki from in front of the door and flung it open, just as Leona was about to pulverize it with a fireball.
<br />

<br />
"Where is he? Where's that little perverted creep that stole my...."
<br />

<br />
Leona looked around and gasp in shock, this was the place her parents had came to visit before meeting her at the inn.  This definitely was going to earn her some punishment of some kind. 
<br />

<br />
"Leona! What's going on here?"
<br />

<br />
"Well uhmm.... I uhmm... He stole my underwear!"
<br />

<br />
Leona pointed at Zenki, who had been trying to make his way to the window, he figured since his grandpa had gotten him into this mess he could hide out the night there, but his escape plans where cut short now.
<br />

<br />
"Zenki!!!"
<br />

<br />
"I swear it wasn't my idea! I was just doing what grandpa wrote in the note!"
<br />

<br />
Zenki was once again hit over the head with the pan, all Shoken and the others could do was laugh.  The old man had done it again, even now he could find a way to cause chaos.
<br />

<br />
"Everything would of went of fine if she wouldn't have seen me... I can't help it she's a slob!"
<br />

<br />
Leona grabbed the pan from Azia and began bashing  Zenki over and over with it.  That was the last straw.  All the while Shoken laughed, it reminded him of all the old times they'd had together.
<br />

<br />
"You didn't tell us she had a temper like Azia."
<br />

<br />
Zolf and Zinka laughed, that was one thing Leona had, she had a firey temper to match her firey red hair.  This definitely was along the lines of the confusion they remembered, but was this also a foretelling of the future to come, especially since it seemed history was now making a rep
<br />

Its short and sweet, but least its funny, and if you liked this let me know guys.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

Chapter 2
<br />

<br />
"The Training begins - The Furious Redhead."
<br />

<br />
Well as you can expect I'd like to thank all the people who give me inspiration for my stories, without you I wouldn't be doing this right now.  Believe it or not this is the truth, special thanks to Monozard and Danini for proving to me that there are still mobs out there stronger than I could ever expect. So on with the Show!!!!
<br />

<br />

<br />
Zenki's life had become a living hell in just one day, not only was he forcefully engaged to someone he didn't know anything about, or care to know anything about, but he never would have expected the training he was going to have to endure.  For at the moment it was taking everything he had to block his fathers attacks, and some how he knew full well his father was holding back.
<br />

<br />
"Don't leave yourself open Zenki!"
<br />

<br />
Before Zenki could regain his concentration he received a swift punch to his face that sent him reeling back against a wall. He always thought the training would be something similar along the lines of smithing, or something else he knew his father could do, but never did he imagine it'd be unarmed combat this intense.
<br />

<br />
"Well I suppose you'll improve... You'll have to if you intend to survive courting Leona."
<br />

<br />
"I think I'll need more than just this to survive against her, she knows magic and I don't..."
<br />

<br />
"Well now isn't that a shame, I suppose I'll just have to show you something better than any kind of spell."
<br />

<br />
"Something better than a spell?"
<br />

<br />
Zenki was puzzled, what in the world could be better than a spell besides acouple tricks he had picked up from traveling with his father to deliver weapons and armor to guards.  For a second he thought that maybe his father was just playing a trick on him, that is until he seen his father hold out an open hand.
<br />

<br />
"Now watch closely son, this is where your advantage comes in handy."
<br />

<br />
In an instant a small glowing orb of power formed from his fathers palm, the soft blue glow seemed to mesmerize Zenki.  He had never really seen something that wasn't a physical attack and certainly wasn't a spell.  Spells required the use of channeling mana, and thus when the spell started it was visible to see the gathering of the mana required, but this was much different, it had seemed to materialize out of thin air.
<br />

<br />
"Don't let your attention be drawn to just one thing son, thats a mistake all fighters make."
<br />

<br />
Shoken tossed the orb into the air and slapped it toward a small pile of disguarded bricks, the ending result was a small explosion that turned the majority of the bricks into dust, an left the remaining ones cracking and crumbling around themselves.
<br />

<br />
"How did you do that?!"
<br />

<br />
"Oh its just alittle something that came naturally to me I suppose, you should be able to do the same thing."
<br />

<br />
Zenki had an idea, if he could do this then maybe he could get use it to save himself from being blasted to hell and back by Leona, he knew full well she was going to be coming back later that day and would most likely try to beat the living daylights out of him.
<br />

<br />
Leona frowned, she would have finished beating the daylights out of Zenki the day before if it wasn't for her parents dragging her back to the inn. She would have killed Zenki right then and there, of course now at the moment she was being chewed out by her father.
<br />

<br />
"Leona, how could you?! I mean seriously, the last boyfriend you had was worse than Zenki is."
<br />

<br />
"Only because you tried to incinerate him!"
<br />

<br />
"Well what do you think I was gonna do? That little display you put on with him was embarrassing and degrading."
<br />

<br />
"Do I really have to marry that little creep?"
<br />

<br />
"Yes, I'm afraid so dear, weither you realize it or not he's probably more than a match for you in combat."
<br />

<br />
"But he can't even cast a simple spell, all he does is use stupid compounds that gnomes invented to make his escape."
<br />

<br />
"Fine, if you want to try to kill him, but I don't think you'll succeed in it."
<br />

<br />
"All right then I will!!!"
<br />

<br />
Leona stormed out of the Inn and headed down the street, she was going to get rid of Zenki, and then maybe see if she could find a date for the night in the city. It was impossible for anyone who couldn't cast spells to beat her, she'd experienced her fair share of fights during her travels from city to city, and she'd never been beaten. She flung open the door and stomped past Azia, and all Azia could do was smile slightly, she knew the girl had no idea what she was getting herself into.
<br />

<br />
Zenki had just finished learning what his father called the "Iron Fist" technique, it was a small start but with this learned he could put his fists through wood, maybe even stone, but he wasn't about to test that theory just yet.  However he did know how to do the regular striking and kicking attacks most monks learned from their guild, even though he never really liked to use them.  He was always partial to throwing daggers or using sleeping potions and drugs to get by, and even poison at times when it was gnolls.  Little did he realize the monk combative skills he'd learned as a boy would be what he'd be forced to use, because Leona kicked open the door and walked into the enclosed backyard where Shoken had been training Zenki.
<br />

<br />
"All right you little cretin, the only way my parents will let me out of our engagement is if I kill you, so prepare to die!"
<br />

<br />
"Now wait just a minute I......"
<br />

<br />
Zenki jumped to the side as Leona sent a small fireball in his direction that nearly knocked down one of the thick stone walls it collided with.  Now he knew he was in trouble, she was serious, and not only that she was angry.
<br />

<br />
"I don't want to fight you!"
<br />

<br />
"Tough luck, your going to die!"
<br />

<br />
At that Leona flung another ball of fire towards Zenki, who ducked to the side and leapt into the air, aiming a flying kick towards Leona, who stepped out of the way causing him to land on his back.  For his mistake she attempted to stomp on his head, only to find that he and rolled back and hand sprung away from her.  All Shoken could do was laugh, this was much better than actually training Zenki, he'd learn much faster this way at least.
<br />

<br />
"Hey Son, why not try altering Vibration Array."
<br />

<br />
Shoken looked at the ground, then at Zenki and nodded.  Zenki finally caught onto the idea, with enough manipulation he could cause the ground under Leona to explode if he done it right.  Leona mearly looked puzzled at Zenki who kneeled down and prepared to strike the ground with his fist.
<br />

<br />
"Giving up so soon? It's not going to save your life."
<br />

<br />
"Who said I was giving up! Take this!"
<br />

<br />
Zenki struck the ground with his fist, at first nothing happened, but after he had stood up the effect was already beginning to show, the ground itself was cracking in a path towards where Leona stood.  A split second later the ground under her feet seemed to explode, sending her flying into the air, causing her to land on the roof of the house.
<br />

<br />
"Sucker!"
<br />

<br />
Zenki laughed and stuck his tongue out at her, mocking her.  This only proved to enrage Leona further, who retaliated with a iceball that struck Zenki square in the chest, sending him sliding back up against a wall. Shoken shook his head, Zenki still had much to learn.
<br />

<br />
"I told you to pay attention."
<br />

<br />
"Sorry Dad!  I'm not use to fighting witches like this."
<br />

<br />
"Witch? What makes you call me a witch?!"
<br />

<br />
"Well for one, you can cast spells, two, your not pretty enough to be a Sorceress, and three I just don't like you."
<br />

<br />
"Why you impudent little moron! At least I'm intelligent enough to cast spells!"
<br />

<br />
Zenki stuck his tongue out at her again only to struck by a bolt of lightning that leapt from Leona's hands, this just wasn't going to be one of his days.  In his mind he knew at best he could fight her to a stalemate, but if she gained the upper hand for to long he'd be dead.  Zenki, leapt out of the way as Leona hurled another bolt of lightning in his direction.
<br />

<br />
"Catch me if you can!"
<br />

<br />
Zenki leapt up onto the roof and took off, he was going to use the rooftops in hopes that he could avoid her spells long enough for her to run out of mana.  What Zenki didn't know was that Leona knew just what he was trying to do, and was purposely conserving her mana for one of her more powerful spells so she could finish him off once he was to tired to avoid it.
<br />

<br />
The Guards below looked up to see sparks of mana shooting left and right from the spells Leona was casting, all they could do was look on in awe, although some looked up to see if they could catch a better view at Leona, at one point several of the guards began to take bets.
<br />

<br />
"I bet 3 gold pieces she kills him."
<br />

<br />
"I'll take that bet!"
<br />

<br />
Zenki couldn't believe what he heard from the guards, that was it for them, he wasn't going to offer his superb snooping services to them for a long while.  That was if he survived this fight with Leona, for him time seemed to slow down as his stamina began to fade, and then finally he had run out, he did his best just to move to the side as a Leona sent out a force shock at him, one that caught his left arm and caused it to go numb.
<br />

<br />
"Well looks like you finally got me."
<br />

<br />
"Thats right you little bastard, now your going to die."
<br />

<br />
Zenki's eyes widened as mana began to surge up around Leona in a dense field, she'd planned this all a long, here he was hardly able to avoid her and now she was going to clobber him with a spell that would probably  blow the entire roof off the building they where on. Suddenly Leona channeled the mana into a large spheroid of swirling fire and lightning, and with a snap of her wrists the mass flew off towards Zenki, it was then that time seemed to stop, and a mysterious cloaked figure appeared before him.
<br />

<br />
"Well it looks like your in a awful load of trouble."
<br />

<br />
"Who the heck are you?"
<br />

<br />
"Well I'm more or less a helper so to speak."
<br />

<br />
"Why are you here?"
<br />

<br />
"Oh that's simple, I'm here to help you."
<br />

<br />
"Well how do you plan to do that."
<br />

<br />
"I'd like to show you an technique."
<br />

<br />
There was a blinding flash of light in Zenki's mind, then it was as if every part of his body was invigorated with new energy, the likes of which he had never felt. However to the outside world nothing seemed to happen except for a blank expression that was on Zenki's face.
<br />

<br />
The look that Leona saw on Zenki's face puzzled her, it looked like he was in a daze until he threw his arms forward, catching the swirling mass of fiery lightning in his hands. She thought it was impossible to stop a spell once the caster was done casting it, but here Zenki seemed to have done the impossible. The result was an explosion, then finally when the dust and smoke cleared Zenki was still standing, unharmed.
<br />

<br />
"Oh you think your so fancy stopping my spell, well I still have more left for you!"
<br />

<br />
Zenki didn't say a word, instead he moved to the side dodging her next spell, it was odd, he could now easily avoid her attacks, he had already picked up on her signature movements that she unconsciously done before casting her spells, it was a matter of timing now, which is something Leona didn't have.
<br />

<br />
"All right fine... You think your such a hot shot, why don't you try this one on for size..."
<br />

<br />
Zenki recognized the spell she was casting, it was Sunstrike, and it would surely destroy the building they where standing on, along with setting fire to the others around them.  He was stuck and he knew it, if he didn't do something he'd be in deeper trouble than he already was.  Leona just smirked and launched the deadly projectile at Zenki, who took a chance and leapt up into the air.
<br />

<br />
"Stupid Fool!"
<br />

<br />
Zenki's hands began to glow with power as instincts began to take over as Leona redirected the spell upwards toward him, he now understood what his father meant by this coming naturally and he was determined to use what the stranger showed him, it was going to be just enough to stop Leona's onslaught.
<br />

<br />
"Fukei!"
<br />

<br />
Zenki thrust his hands downward as several glowing red orbs shot from his palms and collided with the mass of mana that was following. The resulting explosion flung Zenki higher into the air and send Leona reeling off the rooftop and onto the street below. It was then that Zenki snapped his wrists together and sent down the final sphere of energy at Leona....

Chapter 3
<br />

<br />
"The Punishment."
<br />

<br />
It's Fun time again! Actually I'm writing again because my Necromancer got boring as hell, anyway I've been neglecting my fans for far to long. Also it seems that EQ in general is becoming boring, lets just hope I can weasel my way into Star Wars Galaxies beta sometime soon.
<br />

<br />

<br />
This was the worst possible punishment Zenki could of imagined. All because Leona and himself had practically levels two buildings in Qeynos his father was going to make him work off the repairs for them. He would of rather been smithing free weapons or armor for the repayment, instead he was stuck delivering mail and spell scrolls.
<br />

<br />
"Stupid witch... This is all your fault!"
<br />

<br />
"My fault?!"
<br />

<br />
Leona hated this, her father was making her help Zenki even though she thought it wasn't her fault. After all he had dealt the last blow, and it was his last attack that caused the most destruction. Still she wondered just how Zenki could of caused it all. Then again the other puzzling thing was how did she survive the attack. She hated to admit it, but her father was right in the fact that Zenki had more power that she thought.
<br />

<br />
"Stupid wi......"
<br />

<br />
Before he could react Leona had done smacked Zenki over the head with a scroll. All he did was call her that ever since they had left Qeynos, and they where already nearing the bridge outpost in the Karanas. To her the idea of simply traveling wasn't so bad, but to constantly be called names was just too much.
<br />

<br />
"This stinks! Why do things like this always happen to me! I'm a refined lady..."
<br />

<br />
"Refined? Yes. But a lady? More like a girl from what I seen."
<br />

<br />
All he could do was snicker, because he knew the insult hit home. Sure he hadn't seen enough of her from their previous encounters, but Zenki knew this was giving him somewhat of an edge in the arguments. Least that's what he thought until Leona smacked him once again with a spell scroll.
<br />

<br />
Little did the two know they where being followed, for some reason some rather dark forces had set their sights on them. All the two figures could do was smile, they had their prey in sights and even though they still couldn't determine who their main objective was, it was evident they where going to have some fun with these two. From what they had seen the woman seemed more prone to violence, and thus they thought in their minds she seemed more likely to hold the power they searched for.
<br />

<br />
"So... We destroy the one who manipulates the energies and we're done?"
<br />

<br />
"That's right, we can't allow -their- power to continue to grow..."
<br />

<br />
Yet these two where themselves where being watched by a man cloaked in the shadows, wisps of red hair came down concealing all but his black glimmering eyes. He knew the two who where following his nephew where demons. He began to wonder if his decision to intervene in the events in Qeynos was worth drawing this much attention. However, he knew if things came to the worst he could dispose of the two demons, they had no real idea of the true powers that Zenki or anyone with their bloodline could contain.
<br />

<br />
"Hopefully I can take a bath when we reach Freeport, if it wasn't for you I could of just teleported there."
<br />

<br />
"Miss high and mighty still hasn't learned to teleport others yet, and here I thought you had more skill."
<br />

<br />
Zenki laughed, that would certainly put a dent in her ego, at least until she decided to smack him again with the scroll. This was getting to be a habit of hers, he didn't know who was worse about hitting him with things now, his mother or Leona. At that moment he was still wondering about that. After all it was pretty normal for his father and him to get hit, of course neither had the nerve to tell her that it wasn't hurting them much anymore.
<br />

<br />
It was then that the two demons made their move, they appeared from the shadows and instantly struck Zenki, sending him sliding across the ground on his face.  Leona in the meantime was cornered, she didn't know what to do since everything happened so fast, all he heard was Zenki. In truth she couldn't imagine how he could still be conscious from a hit like that.
<br />

<br />
"That hurts almost as bad as when my mom broke her frying pan over my head..."
<br />

<br />
He was slow to get to his feet, he was lying about it. It felt like the whole side of his body that was hit was broken. This of course surprised the two demons, they had thought for sure the attack would of killed him, for the most part it did kill humans in one strike.
<br />

<br />
"Why did you hold back? You know what we're suppose to do!"
<br />

<br />
"He's tougher than he looks, but he'll die, don't worry."
<br />

<br />
With that one of the two stepped forward, then a mass of black mana erupted from its hands and collided with Zenki head on. Nothing could describe the amount of pain Zenki was put in as a fell forward. To the demons he no longer seemed alive, and in truth his mind was still conscious. What had really happened was his mind had finally shut down from the shock.
<br />

<br />
"Now what shall we do with her? Perhaps we should take her back with us and let our brethren have their way with her?"
<br />

<br />
"No harm could come of that, we can dispose of her easily there..."
<br />

<br />
Leona's mind was racing, she knew she couldn't take on beings like this, and with Zenki now dead she didn't have much hope of escaping. These creatures where savage and brutal, with no compassion at all. She could tell they where pure evil, no trace of goodness or light dwelled within there being. 
<br />

<br />
All the cloaked figure could do was smile, the demons had made their first mistake. They failed to release that Zenki was still alive. That was their first mistake he saw, the second was they hadn't been told of the young mans training or past experience. His smile grew wider as he saw Zenki's fingers twitch, his body was recovering from the attacks.
<br />

<br />
All Zenki could do was focus on what his father had taught him, for the most part all the training he had received had been that of a monks. He had seen his fathers wounds heal nearly instant through sheer will power. His body had remembered the training, and his subconscious was putting it to good use as again his fingers twitched.
<br />

<br />
Leona couldn't believe what she saw, she had actually seen Zenki's fingers move. She didn't think it was possible, but somehow he had survived the last attack. More importantly this meant she might actually live to see her parents again, and perhaps after this little incident they'd reconsider the situation.
<br />

<br />
"Zenki get up already and save me!"
<br />

<br />
The two demons found this outburst amusing, to them it was just a feeble attempt to distract for her to try and escape. He was dead, no human could survive a direct unguarded attack from their powers. It was clearly impossible.
<br />

<br />
"Get up already and save me!"
<br />

<br />
"Shut up! He's dead and you soon will be too!"
<br />

<br />
For her outcries she was struck across the face, the demon's claws left light cuts across her cheek. They loved causing pain, and even more so they loved the taste and smell of fresh blood as one the demons tongues snaked out of its gruesome mouth and across the marks on Leona's face. This in turn sent a chill up her spine, but also Zenki could see what was happening out of the corner of his eye.
<br />

<br />
All Zenki could feel was some sort of burning, all encompassing urge overwhelm his mind. It seethed and burned. Whatever this feeling was it was causing his body to feel as if it was on fire, it was burning away the fresh wounds. It was then that Zenki decided that he would stop them from doing anymore harm to Leona as he forced his broken body to stand up once more.
<br />

<br />
"Leave her alone..."
<br />

<br />
The two where surprised, as they turned to see Zenki standing again. They couldn't believe he was alive, and even if he was he surely couldn't do anything to them. After all to date no human had ever harmed them. They simply found this to be amusing, letting out what could best be described as laughter, as they once again struck Leona.
<br />

<br />
"You shouldn't have done that..."
<br />

<br />
"There's nothing you can do to stop us human."
<br />

<br />
"That's right, you can barely stand as it is..."
<br />

<br />
Zenki rushed forward with such speed that the demons as well as Leona lost track of him. This startling new ability frightened Leona, to her this speed was unnatural and inhuman. The next thing she knew one of the demons that had been holding her captive was being lifting into the air and then drove down with enough force to bury its form beneath the earth. It was apparent that Zenki had finally had enough, his anger was controlling his actions now.
<br />

<br />
Zenki's form then seemed to disappear from sight again, only to be found behind the next demon. With a quick flying kick the demon found itself sailing through the air and towards the water. Taking this as a chance to gain some advantage it simply levitated out over the water. It was then that Zenki unleashed his rage once again on its comrade, driving his hands down into the earth and ripping its body upwards with a jerk.
<br />

<br />
"This is impossible! Your not....."
<br />

<br />
Before the gruesome creature could utter another word it found its head in Zenki's grip, and then with a quick squeeze its life was over. Blood and bone spattered to the ground as the demons head seemed to explode in Zenki's hands. This was not the same Zenki that Leona had seen before, he was like a monster, maddened by the power he now possessed.
<br />

<br />
For the first time the creature knew fear, it truly was scared for its foul life. Whatever this person was it certainly couldn't be a human in his eyes, it was so savage and brutal. In fact to the demon Zenki's personality was more like its own, yet it was different. The demon could sense that he wasn't fighting for the pure pleasure of it, some other driving force was causing this.
<br />

<br />
All Leona could do was stare in awe as Zenki ran across the surface of the water, it was clear his sights where sent on their last assailant. It was then the demon made a feeble attempt to escape by leaping into the air. Zenki was in hot pursuit and did the same, a short geyser of water forming from where he had jumped. Leona could tell this was not going to be good even if Zenki did win. All his attacks where landing precisely, this in turn causing the creature to resort to other tactics.
<br />

<br />
"So you think you've gotten me beaten... Then have a taste of our true power!!!"
<br />

<br />
With a couple quick gestures from the creatures hands a black void appeared around Zenki and engulfed him. Leona had heard of a type of magic that even the highest of wizards couldn't use, it was an innate property found only in creatures known as Demons. At least now she knew what she was facing. However, the demon did not, as it thought this would surely finish off Zenki.
<br />

<br />
The cloaked figure smiled at seeing the demon's latest attempt. He knew it would take more than a simple Shadow magic attack to defeat him. Even more so the disturbing was the fact that Zenki was smiling while inside the black mass. He was preparing something for the creature, something that felt very familiar.
<br />

<br />
"Fukei!!!"
<br />

<br />
The black mass scattered as several crimson orbs shot out from Zenki's hands and collided with the creature. It was then that Leona dove for cover, she had seen this before and knew it wasn't going to be pleasant. Of course this all had surprised the demon, it was never expecting something like this.
<br />

<br />
Finally as the last orb was released from Zenki hands a light erupted from where the demon once was. It engulfed the surrounding area and could be seen for miles. This is turn had a startling effect on the guards who where at the bridge encampment in the Karana's.
<br />

<br />
As the light faded away Leona seen Zenki fall to the waters below. All his power had been expended on the final assault, which comforted her. Things where going to get much more interesting for her now...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

Chapter 4
<br />

<br />
"Innocence and the Darkness Within."
<br />

<br />

<br />
Okay so I'm back at it again, what can I say I'm crazy. Anyway this chapter will be stray from what your use to folks. For starters you won't heard hide nor hair of Zenki or Leona. Now don't go getting upset just yet, this will definitely be a refreshening experience for my fans.
<br />

<br />

<br />
All he could do was wonder just what his father was thinking sending him on such a trip. Sure he must of had some special reason, but because of who his mother was he was often viewed by most races as trash. To most he appeared human, but in face he was a half breed, half human and half dark elf. This alone made him traveling in the area he was in very dangerous. Sure he had the same build and physical appearance as a human, which made things easier, but he was also gifted with his mothers knack for being extremely fast and dexterous.
<br />

<br />
To make matters worse concealing his appearance only seemed to attract the kind of people he really didn't want to be worried with. Most of the time the guards he encountered overlooked him, after all it wasn't odd to see a person nearly completely covered by a hooded cloak. Of course this also seemed to draw pickpockets and bandits to him like flies to honey. Still through it all he had managed to keep his coin purse and his money, at the expense of giving several people broken arms.
<br />

<br />
Still, he couldn't help but wonder why his father wanted him to personally go and receive information on what was happening on the continent of Faydwer. Sure he had heard stories about how his father and mother had both fought a battle in the Greater Faydark, but that was years ago, before he was even born. Nevertheless, he was going to obey his father's wishes by going to some contacts and getting the information he needed.
<br />

<br />
The young man could definitely believe his father had been here before as he entered the Greater Faydark. As he continued on near the spires he seen the tree's which still bore the scars of a savage battle. Something was different, it was like there had been another person during the great struggle from the feeling he was receiving. He never could understand why he could feel such things though, how he could feel where a person had been before or not.
<br />

<br />
To him it was simply more a curse than a gift, mainly because at times the feeling he got from the way his father fought made him afraid. It was like some darkness was being focused, something unnatural being twisted and refined into something that was barely controlled by the light. All these things gnawed at him as he traveled further into the forest.
<br />

<br />
Things hadn't changed much in the forest over the passage of time. Kelethin was still standing and the great city of Felwithe still remained. Even the Crushbone clan of Orc's still existed, though they hadn't gotten any brighter over the passage of time. The only difference the young man could really notice in the Orc's where that they where much smaller to their counter parts located just near his home city of Freeport. Of course he was just about to find out another difference....
<br />

<br />
"Orc Smash! Orc Crush! Orc Kill!!!"
<br />

<br />
The young man barely had a chance to move as several Orcs leap from the tree with their weapons drawn. This was definitely turning out to be an odd adventure for him as he managed to dodge the on coming Orcs feeble attacks. They certainly where much faster than the ones he was use to, and their size made it slightly harder for him to judge their attacks. However, by the time the Orcs where done attacking they where to exhausted to hold their weapons.
<br />

<br />
"See wasn't that foolish? Now why don't you run along and harass something else."
<br />

<br />
Before the Orcs could once again speak, they each found an arrow driven through their hearts. In fact the young man had been aware that someone or something else was watching the on going fight. As usual what his grandfather had said was true, if your being watched never do anything that might cause yourself more problems. This time it meant he could hide his appearance from the on looking wood elves who had revealed themselves at last.
<br />

<br />
With a simple nod of his head, the young man was once on his way to meet his contacts, which happened to be in Kelethin. Luck was on his side, most wood elves and high elves he had met could tell by looking in his eyes he wasn't completely human. It would be doubtful if they'd let such a suspicious person enter Kelethin.
<br />

<br />
All the young man could do was stare at the city in awe as he reached one of the many lifts. It amazed him that an entire city could be built within nothing but tree's. Not only that, but the sheer size of the city itself was something else, though it wasn't nearly as big as Freeport it was impressive to see. Even for his fascination he kept his eyes under the cloaks hood, he couldn't afford to be seen just yet, or to be harassed by the guards he seen on patrol.
<br />

<br />
It was puzzling, his father had given him a map with the exact location of his contacts home. More so puzzling yet it was apparent that they where either wood elves, or half elves to be living here in Kelethin. From his past knowledge his father was never overly friendly with anyone, let alone elves, with the exception of his mother. All he could do was smile, remembering how his father was always so gentle and kind around himself and his mother. However he soon brought his thoughts back to the map, and to the names of his contacts.
<br />

<br />
"Daxster and Selena..."
<br />

<br />
Even mumbling the names to himself didn't bring any idea or thought to who the where as he reached the door to their apparent home. With a few simple raps on the door with his knuckles he got an answer, being greeted by a wood elf woman, whom as to be expected had a puzzled look on her face. All confusion was soon set aside as the young man handed the map and a small note to her though, and with that he was allowed inside.
<br />

<br />
"So your their son are you? You don't have any proof that your really what you say you are do you?"
<br />

<br />
"I knew there would be some disbelief, maybe this will prove it."
<br />

<br />
At that the young man pulled back the hood of his cloak, in the process revealing his charcoal black hair, along with his near black eyes. This brought a small look of astonishment and a gasp from the woman. There was no mistake now to her that he truly was whom he claimed to be.
<br />

<br />
"I believe you, you have your mothers eyes. Sorry if I seemed so apprehensive, it's just your father..."
<br />

<br />
"I understand, so exactly what am I suppose to be here for."
<br />

<br />
"To the point aren't you, your definitely his son."
<br />

<br />
Selena smiled, she could see that this young man had definitely gained his mothers gentleness, along with his father's straight forward personality. She hadn't heard from his parents in awhile and was a little confused when they sent word their son would be coming. Though she was in a particular dilemma at the time, what with the last few days of events.
<br />

<br />
"You'll have to forgive me if I seen distracted. My daughter has disappeared, and my husband went to search for her."
<br />

<br />
"Husband? An exceptional man with the bow and very silent, am I right?"
<br />

<br />
"Did you see him on your way here?"
<br />

<br />
"Maybe, would it be all right if I took this thing off?"
<br />

<br />
"Of course, there's no reason for you to be afraid to be seen here, by the way what is your name."
<br />

<br />
"My name is Janus..."
<br />

<br />
It was evident he was tired of staying stuffed up under a cloak as he removed it with a quick tug. It had been days since he was able to be comfortable. What with the curiosity of the dwarves and the like he had encountered in the Butcher Block mountains. And of course the travelers and the like he had run across out on the road.
<br />

<br />
"Anyway, what your father wanted to know was just what was going on between Neriak and the Orcs, but we really haven't been able to find out a word."
<br />

<br />
"Well now I know why he sent me instead of having it delivered by messenger."
<br />

<br />
"I suppose in a few more days we could have the information you want."
<br />

<br />
Just at that moment Daxster walked in with a solemn look on his face. He was obviously rattled by something. This alone made Selena fear the worst for her daughter, after all, why else would Daxster be acting like this.
<br />

<br />
"Selena, Iris has been captured by the Orcs."
<br />

<br />
"Iris is the name of your daughter right?"
<br />

<br />
"That's right Janus, and this is my husband, Daxster."
<br />

<br />
Daxster finally took a look at their guest, it took him awhile to finally realize who it was, but he could definitely tell who's child he was. The proof was in Janus's eyes, as well as his personality, it was something that was unmistakable.
<br />

<br />
"Well I can't exactly wait around here, for long, and I can't very well sit around while a innocence girl is in danger."
<br />

<br />
"You mean your going to go into Crushbone?"
<br />

<br />
"That is the idea, besides its the quickest way for me to get the information I need."
<br />

<br />
"Well the best time for you to try is near sunset, and be careful."
<br />

<br />
"I'll be fine, you'll have your daughter back with you soon..."
<br />

<br />
They certainly couldn't figure out how come Janus could be so alike, yet different from his father at the same time. Then again they never could figure out how anyone could be so cruel or violent, yet still manage to have a family either. However, both Selena and Daxster where glad that Janus was here, because if he had inherited any of his father's power and abilities then the Orcs would do good just to live through the night.
<br />

<br />
The guards around Kelethin where at their usual posts, they knew the Orcs where even active during the night. What they hadn't planned on was what they seen before them, a man completely dressed in black garments jumped off one of the many platforms of Kelethin and managed to land safely at that. In a flash he was off running, in the direction of Crushbone. To them anyone going there at this time had to be crazy.
<br />

<br />
None of the Orcs guarding the entrance seen Janus as he slipping in with the shadows caused by the sunset. He had heard stories of how the Orcs took slaves, some for mining purposes, and some for other acts that where of a more horrid nature. Still no matter what he was going to find out as much information as possible while still saving Iris. After all it wasn't really in his nature to not help a damsel in distress, besides who knows just what he could accomplish here tonight. Perhaps he could do enough for the elves to earn enough trust with them to be able to walk around without having to hide himself from their eyes.
<br />

<br />
Seeing at night was no problem for Janus, but he also knew the Orcs could see at night as well. That's something he learned long ago as a child. He had learned a lot since those days when he would recklessly rush into anything without first learning more about it. Another little trick he had managed to pick up was the ability move like creatures of the night.
<br />

<br />
It wasn't very hard for him to find the slaves holding area, most of them appeared to be wood elves. All he could do was nod his head as he observed the area. He couldn't very well leave all these people here to do such demeaning and horrid work or acts. Then again he couldn't start freeing anyone right away either, if he did then it would cause a commotion and get him into more trouble than he wanted.
<br />

<br />
Finding Iris was going to be much harder than he thought, and worse yet was the fact that he could sense something nearby. It was definitely bad news for him, and it didn't give off the feelings the slaves or the Orcs gave off. All he could do was shiver, this was getting more complicated that he bargained for, but he couldn't break his word. It was then that he took a leap of faith and woke up one of the wood elf slaves.
<br />

<br />
"Be very quiet... I'll get you out of here, but first I have to find someone, do you know a girl called Iris?"
<br />

<br />
"Iris? They took her far in the back with some other women earlier."
<br />

<br />
"Stay quiet... I'll return soon..."
<br />

<br />
Janus had to admit, he was surprised that had went so well, he would of expected the poor elf to go into hysterics. It was complicated doing what he had planned next, but it was definitely worth a try. Lady luck had been on his side for awhile now. It was difficult enough to crawl along the walls, if someone seen him it would of reminded them of some kind of overgrown spider, but being over a ledge over the furthest slave area was definite a chilling experience.
<br />

<br />
What he saw disgusted him, the women had practically been stripped of their clothes except for the bare essentials. Further more crouching upside down under the ledge was even worse than wearing the cloak since the blood was rushing to his head. The next thing he saw where an orc and two dark elf men come into the area. The one was completely clad in plate armor, and the other was in robes, which meant at the worst he now not only faced the Orcs, but also a fighter and a magic user of some sort.
<br />

<br />
"You want woman? Point an I tell price."
<br />
"We would prefer the youngest of the lot here, also a freshly caught one at that."
<br />

<br />
"Dat be this one. Flower girl, very pretty."
<br />

<br />
Moments later he seen a girl dragged from the group and taken away with the men. In his mind he wondered, if this one was Iris or not. He would have to ask the others below weather she was or not. If she was his job just got nearly ten times harder. He wondered how women could be such trouble as he released his grip and landed on the ground near the women.
<br />

<br />
"Hello ladies, now be quiet and you'll get out of here soon... I need to know where the girl called Iris is at."
<br />

<br />
"They took her to..."
<br />

<br />
"That's all I need to know."
<br />

<br />
There was a glitter of light as Janus dropped two daggers to the ground and leapt off into the darkness. Not only had he found out what Neriak latest involvement with the Orcs was, but he also knew what his father had been worried about. Things certainly would be what his grandfather would call fun, what with all the scantly clad women he just left behind. At the moment he had more to worry about those as he managed to crawl through a window in the small fortress.
<br />

<br />
Janus knew if he didn't think of something good that he would have a hard time escaping. Surely a surprise attack would work, but if he didn't plan it all out carefully then he could be in deep trouble. The worst case scenario involved him or Iris being killed. Least that's the worst he could image at the moment as he crawled along the ceiling of the hallway closer to where he could sense the two dark elves at.
<br />

<br />
Needless to say Janus was upset as he peeked through the crack at the top of the door, and into the room Iris was in. They had paid the Orc to use her for their own horrid deeds, still for the moment she was safe and out of attack range which gave him some time to formulate a plan. To take advantage of someone... To be forced like they where intending to do to her, it was enough to make Janus's normally calm and docile personality fade away.
<br />

<br />
Many a time he had seen his father angry and had never really understood what could drive someone to fight and train like he did. Now he realized his father probably trained to protect his family, but this feeling he had now was growing stronger. It was like his blood was boil, and even worse his fingers where now sinking deep into the stone ceiling, unknown to Janus of course.
<br />

<br />
Things certainly didn't look to favorable now, he was going to be forced to play his hand no matter the consequences. Janus looked on as one of the dark elves neared Iris, before realized what was happening he had dropped to the floor and had literally ripped the door from its hinges. Then he threw it to the two dark elves and sent them back into a corner. This in turn caused Iris to scream out at the top of her lungs.
<br />

<br />
"AHHHHH! It's a Demon! Stay way!!!"
<br />

<br />
"Do I look like a demon to you!!!"
<br />

<br />
Before Iris to react or say a thing he had already grabbed her and was in the process of making his way down the hall. He knew that the Orcs would soon be up to investigate just what happened, and Iris struggling against him was slowing them both down. It appeared his only chance was to leap out the window and hopefully find a place to hide from view.
<br />

<br />
"Not so fast, that woman is ours! Bought and paid for! Get him before he gets away you foolish wizard!"
<br />

<br />
"Inferno Shock!"
<br />

<br />
The wizard's hand surged with mana as a fiery mass of mana leapt from them just as Janus had jumped through the window with Iris in his arms. All he could feel was a burning sensation then intense pain as he turned his back toward the ground, shielding Iris from the fall. The landing had a more sobering effect on Iris than what one would expect.
<br />

<br />
Iris's mind was no longer racing, panicked, and frightened. Reason had finally broken through those emotions as she realized just what had happened. Who or whatever this person was had just saved her, and not only that they had sacrificed their own body to protect her. Before she could even think of escaping though, several orcs had taken her in their grasp.
<br />

<br />
"Not so fast you scum!"
<br />

<br />
Janus had regained his bearings and was on the offensive, first kicking one of the Orcs that was restraining Iris directly in its face, probably improving its looks in the process. The next thing Iris knew she could see a fist lash out, catching her other captor across the face, which in turn sent into the water nearby.
<br />

<br />
The on-looking slaves who where in the process of freeing themselves where surprised. This person who they could tell was definitely not a full blood human was fighting with passion more fierce than any of their own guards. He wasn't fighting for his own life at all, he was fighting to save others which would regard him as an enemy.
<br />

<br />
It didn't take long for the two dark elves to rush outside, intent on regaining what they regarded as their property. The wizard of the pair couldn't believe this person who, or whatever it was, was still able to move, let alone fight off the Orcs that where coming after him and the girl. It was then that the dark elf that Janus had observed in plate earlier torn a sword from an Orcs grasp and rushed forward.
<br />

<br />
"She's our property now you pathetic fool!"
<br />

<br />
There was a quick glint of light as the dark elf struck out at Janus, only managing to graze his shoulder in doing so. It was just Janus's luck that there where no weapons near him, he was now stuck using hand to hand against an armed opponent, one he knew nothing about. It was then that he felt suddenly weak, he now knew what his opponent was from the mana surging through his free hand. He was facing a seasoned Shadow Knight.
<br />

<br />
"Give up now before you die."
<br />

<br />
"Never!!!"
<br />

<br />
"Then so be it!"
<br />

<br />
On this swing Janus wasn't so lucky as the blade sliced through the skin of his chest. Then next thing he realized he was sent flying backwards by an unknown force. A force that caused pain to surge though his entire body and mind as he fell backwards against a wall. He was losing, and worse yet he didn't have the strength to escape now.
<br />

<br />
"Shall I finish this fool off so we can get back to business?"
<br />

<br />
"Yes, a fiery death for him sounds suiting doesn't it?"
<br />

<br />
"It most certainly does."
<br />

<br />
Iris simply looked on in horror from the Shadow Knight's grasp as fire erupted from the wizard's hands and encircled Janus. She couldn't believe anyone could be so cruel, or that anyone could be so gallant even to the end. It looked as if her fate was now sealed to whatever these two cruel beings had intended for her now.
<br />

<br />
All Janus could do was scream out in pain as the flames hit his skin, he knew this was the end. All he could think of was how he was letting Selena and Daxster down, as well as his parents. In his mind all he could do was curse himself for being weak, and wish that somehow he had the power to at least complete what he had come to do. It was then that he seen a figure shrouded in the shadows within his mind.
<br />

<br />
- Why wish for power you already have. -
<br />

<br />
- I don't have any power, not like my father does. -
<br />

<br />
- Of course you do, you have it, but your afraid of it. Are you afraid you'll be like your father? -
<br />

<br />
- I haven't got any power! -
<br />

<br />
- Look at you, you don't even have the will power to fight anymore, you've given up! -
<br />

<br />
- There's nothing I can do! -
<br />

<br />
- Foolish boy, let your mind go blank, then your power will come to you! -
<br />

<br />
All Janus had left was to try, what harm could it do to give any chance he had left a try he thought. As his mind was becoming blank, the pain from the fire seemed to fade away. Soon it was replaced with a warm pulsating feeling that followed through his body.
<br />

<br />
The dark elves had done began to drag Iris back into the fortress when they heard the screams from some of the still freed slaves. The couldn't believe what they seen before their eyes. Even worse was the fact that maybe what the wood elves had been screaming was true, maybe this person was really a demon.
<br />

<br />
Iris couldn't believe her eyes as she watched Janus stand up and slowly walk out of the flames. Surprisingly there were very few burns visible, and not only that but he looked somehow stronger than he was before. There was definitely something different about him now, but rather than being scared now she was glad.
<br />

<br />
Before the dark elves could utter a single word Janus was back on the move. The main focus of his attention for the moment was the wizard as he moved toward him with an unnatural. All that could be seen was a flash of light as the wizard tried to launch his attack at Janus, only to find his own hands being held by what felt like the grip of a devil. In the wizards mind there was a burst of pain, then numbness as he stared down to see two bloody stumps where he use to have hands.
<br />

<br />
"Your a monster!"
<br />

<br />
"Your dead...."
<br />

<br />
Janus made a quick strike to the wizards chest, then moments later the dark elf's heart exploded. This was something that could only be a nightmare to some, but to these few witnesses it was a reality as blood and bone fragments spattered the ground. Seeing this display caused the Shadow Knight to release Iris, and ready himself for an attack.
<br />

<br />
"I don't know what the hell you are, but your going to die!"
<br />

<br />
"No, you are..."
<br />

<br />
The dark elf struck out, trying desperately to land a fatal blow that could kill his foe, but all he found was air each time he attacked. All Iris and the others could do was look on as Janus toyed with the dark elf. They all looked on in awe as Janus caught the sword between two a finger and his thumb, then snap it the blade off at the hilt. With a quick strike to the head it was over, the dark elf's face was crushed in with a single blow, leaving it barely alive for a brief moment and in the same pain it had once inflicted on others.
<br />

<br />
Everyone was shocked yet grateful this had happened, but all where also scared except for Iris. She could sense something kind and gentle about him. Of course this didn't last for long as Janus fell to his hands and knees, he felt completely drained of whatever power he just had. Then everything went black as he finally lost consciousness.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Hope you folks liked Janus, I know I sure did while writing this and don't worry this will all soon tie into the story just you wait and see.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

Chapter 5
<br />

<br />
"Rest and Regeneration."
<br />

<br />
It seems like Janus and Iris seemed to have caught the attentions of several of my readers. Also I've noticed that several of my readers tend to flatter my works saying that they should be published. Afraid to say that is nearly impossible. Anyway since some people liked Janus and Iris they're going to be in yet another chapter. And yes this does tie in, eventually that is.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Nearly an hour had past since a band of escaped slaves from Crushbone had been taken to Felwithe for treatment of their wounds. Normally this wouldn't have raised any sort of major commotion, except for that every slave had managed to escape in the event due to a single person. Even more disturbing was the person responsible for it, and even for his acts the guards where going to kill him.
<br />

<br />
"That filth doesn't deserve to live!"
<br />

<br />
"He deserves to die like the Orcs of Crushbone do!"
<br />

<br />
Several guards raised their swords in unison, each preparing to strike a fatal blow to the injured man before them. The people who had came in to be treated couldn't believe this was going to happen, but none could argue against the guards. Even the Seniors of the guard agreed that the young man was going to be killed.
<br />

<br />
"Guards, its a pity your kind never could forgive..."
<br />

<br />
"And who are you to say such things of us?"
<br />

<br />
"Do you really intend to stop us from taking this filth's life?"
<br />

<br />
"Taunting someone you know nothing about, nor giving someone the benefit of doubt are mistakes."
<br />

<br />
The figure the guards now glared at was shrouded in a blackened cloak and garments, very much similar to the ones the young man wore. Little did the group of seasoned men know who was in front of them, someone they all should have known better than to invoke anger from. One of the very people who had not only survived the events of the years before, but had also confronted one of their most fierce enemies.
<br />

<br />
One of the more eager of the guards decided the conversation was over and drove his sword down towards the heart of the wounded savior. However, just inches from piercing the flesh and blood of its target it was stopped. The concealed man had nearly disappeared from their sight when he made his move, leaving several of the guards confused as to where he really was until they turned to see their fellow guards throat in the hand of what looked like an apparent foe.
<br />

<br />
"You dare touch one of my flesh and blood?! Your arrogance will be forgiven though..."
<br />

<br />
In a single deft, fluid motion, the guard was flung into a nearby fountain. For a second they could see a smile beneath the hood of the mans cloak. It was as if he knew something special that they all should of known.
<br />

<br />
"I'll leave you now, I have more pressing matters to attend to..."
<br />

<br />
With that the man was gone, though the guards where once again standing over the young man, again ready to take his life in spite of the figures words. This time all the guards drove their blades down, intent on finishing what they had started. This time they met a different kind of obstacle as one of the refugee's ran out and shielded the young man's body wit her own.
<br />

<br />
"You can't! He did nothing wrong!"
<br />

<br />
"Get out of the way stupid girl!"
<br />

<br />
The young wood elf found herself kicked away by one of the guards, for his tactless and despicable abuse of power he was dealt a swift blow from an arrow that run straight through his shoulder. The source of the arrow was a wood elf couple who had just entered the square. The guards where stunned as to way this particular couple would protect this young man.
<br />

<br />
"Sir are you a fool? If you take his life you'll anger one of the two people who have not only held their own against Mayong Mistmoore, but you'll also anger one of the men who defeated him!"
<br />

<br />
The guard went pale at those words, or what one might call pale for a high elf as the words had a sobering effect. They all now realized just who the figure had been before. The name of Mayong Mistmoore itself was enough to chill their spine, but the idea that they had nearly taken the life of someone who was more brutal and savage than even that creature simply brought pure terror into their very being.
<br />

<br />
Before the guards could once again make another protest the wood elf couple, and the young girl had already lifted the young man off the ground and carried him into the clerics guild along with the other refugee's. Realization had set in by that time as the Senior officer ordered his men to return to their posts, as well as his foolish subordinate to the cleric's guild to receive treatment for his shoulder wound.
<br />

<br />
"Well it looks like Janus here kept his word to us about getting our daughter back."
<br />

<br />
"How do you know this Janus?"
<br />

<br />
"It's a long story, but myself and your mother traveled with his parents before you where born."
<br />

<br />
"I thought he was a demon when I first seen him, he looked so angry when..."
<br />

<br />
"When what?"
<br />

<br />
Both Selena and Daxster where now curious as to what really happened. They had only heard that the slaves had been freed. Other then that most of the people rescued didn't say much else other than they seen a strange person who fought like a devil.
<br />

<br />
"It's just that he tore a door completely off its hinges to get to me."
<br />

<br />
"My gods! He's still alive!!!"
<br />

<br />
Before another would could be said one of the clerics attending to Janus screamed in horror. At first they assumed he had died before being brought in and where performing his last rights, that is until they seen his chest still moving. They couldn't believe a person could have such wounds and still be alive.
<br />

<br />
"How could someone take so much punishment and still be alive?"
<br />

<br />
"He... He fought a wizard and what I think was a Shadow Knight..."
<br />

<br />
The clerics turned and looked slack jawed at what Iris had said. They had certainly had their fair share of dealings with the wounds inflicted by both the for mentioned. Never had they seen someone survive while fending them both off at the same time.
<br />

<br />
"And before that he kept the Orcs from taking me back."
<br />

<br />
"He must of been carrying a weapon smiths prized collect to have survived all that."
<br />

<br />
"He was just using his fists..."
<br />

<br />
Iris shook her head, it was beyond comprehension, but nevertheless, what all she had said was true. Janus had done everything, but still even most people would have given up after failing to escape right away. All she could wonder about was what driving force made him stand up to all the punishment, until she heard a the Senior guard bark out orders to increase the number of guards on patrol to find the two responsible for this.
<br />

<br />
"You don't have to do that... He killed them both before succumbing to his injuries."
<br />

<br />
"Well there is absolutely no question now, he is definitely their child."
<br />

<br />
"Your right Daxster, I'd expect the same out of his father."
<br />

<br />
As a young girl, Iris had heard stories about a group of people storming Mistmoore Castle to rescue their friend. The stories also said that only one of the people who went in actually fought against Mayong. She had always heard that her parents where involved but never fully understood how, that is until now.
<br />

<br />
"Mother? Father? Do you mind if I stay here until he wakes up? I want to thank him for everything, and I want to apologize."
<br />

<br />
"We won't mind at all will we?"
<br />

<br />
Selena grabbed Daxster by the arm and pulled him out of the room. Besides she knew that they wouldn't be much help to anyone else just sitting in there in the way. Daxster only smiles and then laughed as he heard some of the clerics commenting on Janus.
<br />

<br />
"I've never seen anyone built like this before, even for a human."
<br />

<br />
"He must be train an awful lot to be like this, just our luck he's a monk."
<br />

<br />
"Quiet ladies, there is a young girl present you know!"
<br />

<br />
Iris couldn't help but blush as she over heard the women clerics while they tended to Janus. Then after hearing the older woman scold them she giggled. It wasn't very often that she seen humans, or monks for that matter. She had heard they where always the type to travel alone, and never ones to stay in one place for long.
<br />

<br />
"Excuse me ma'am, but how can you tell who is a monk and who is not?"
<br />

<br />
"That's very simple child, monk's tend to use staves, or their fists while fighting. They also don't cast spells."
<br />

<br />
This only proved to further confused Iris, she had seen him fight with both his fists and then something else. It certainly wasn't spells she seen used, but it looked to be even more fatal and destructive than any kind of spell she had seen before. She would definitely have to ask Janus when he woke up just what she had seen.
<br />

<br />
What would look like a normal sleep was much more than that. Again he was contending with the figure from before. This time there was a startling revelation, the realization that the power he had used at Crushbone could of been much more devastating than he realized.
<br />

<br />
- Well I'm quite impressed with the amount of control you had in Crushbone. -
<br />

<br />
- Why should you be impressed? -
<br />

<br />
- That is simple, you could of easily destroyed everything there and half way into the Greater Faydark, that is if you lost control of course. -
<br />

<br />
- Why didn't you warn me... All those innocent people could of been hurt, or worse. -
<br />

<br />
- You needed to learn something, having power is one thing, using it the right way is another. -
<br />

<br />
- Why me though? Isn't there anyone else this could of been done to? -
<br />

<br />
- Certainly, but let's just say your special, and we'll leave it at that. -
<br />

<br />
All the while Iris waited patiently for him to wake up, she wanted to make sure he would really be okay. Besides no one else had come for her, or at least even tried to risk saving her. She knew her parents very well couldn't have gotten a party together in time to save her, she was thankful though that she back and safe.
<br />

<br />
It took awhile before Janus finally woke up, needless to say he was confused to where he was at. He was certain the last place he had been was Crushbone, but now he was in some strange room with Iris asleep in the chair beside the bed he was on. At least he was relieved to see she was all right, even if it did feel like an entire army marched over his body.
<br />

<br />
Now Janus had enough time to get a good look at Iris as she slept, from her looks, she appeared to be the same age he was. He could understand her being tired after all they had been through, and certainly the rest was well deserved. One thing that gnawed at his mind while regaining his senses was why was Iris here in his room by his side.
<br />

<br />
Little did anyone realize the serenity that was newly granted to them would be in jeopardy soon. The Orcs of Crushbone had hidden for their lives as several Dark Elves entered their stronghold. None where pleased with the news they had received. In fact the news in question was the fact that two of their people had been killed while visiting the filthy place they now stood in. They where astounded what remained of their comrades.
<br />

<br />
"Sir, from the wounds and the description the Orcs gave that some kind of human did this."
<br />

<br />
"I find that highly unlikely, no simple human has this much power."
<br />

<br />
"But Sir that's what they..."
<br />

<br />
"Keep your lips sealed about this incident, no one is to know besides us, that is an order!"
<br />

<br />
"But what if someone from Neriak arrives to investigate?"
<br />

<br />
"If they do then we'll say they where attacked by some beast, and that we destroyed it."
<br />

<br />
"This is despicable! We're going to cover up this incident without avenging our brethren?!"
<br />

<br />
"Certainly not, we will kill whatever is responsible for this, that part won't be a lie."
<br />

<br />
This elicited a sinister smile from the trio as they departed the Crushbone yards. They had made a fatal mistake as someone had been watching them the entire time. The figure smiled, it would definitely be a good test for the youngster he had left in Felwithe earlier. Besides, he knew the young man was in good hands, some of the finest clerics that he, himself, had been treated by those many years ago.
<br />

<br />
The young cleric yawned as she entered the room, she had been appointed the night watch woman so to speak. She didn't like it even if it was just for the one night, being that they had guests in the guild. Worst yet she had a glimpse of the young man they had treated earlier. Sure his wounds had responded to the treatment, but there was something about him that seemed so out of place.
<br />

<br />
For the moment she brushed those thoughts aside as she covered up the young wood elf beside the bed. It all seemed to odd to her, this man was part dark elf yet he had risked his life to save people who had already condemned him. Then again, she realized that the girl sitting up and sleeping in the chair probably had more sense than the rest of them, considering she had tried to save him.
<br />

<br />
"Well your a quiet one aren't you?"
<br />

<br />
"Your... Your.... Your awake?"
<br />

<br />
Janus smiled for a moment, he had heard the young woman come into the room. Also through his cracked open eyes he had seen her place the blanket over Iris. Still he had to find out just where he was at, and further more find out more about what happened afterwards.
<br />

<br />
"Exactly where am I?"
<br />

<br />
"Well your in the cleric's guild house in Felwithe."
<br />

<br />
"I see... So do you mind telling me how come I'm here?"
<br />

<br />
"You don't know do you? The people who escaped from Crushbone brought you here."
<br />

<br />
"I guess I must have made quite an impression with everyone."
<br />

<br />
"I think that's an understatement."
<br />

<br />
"Thank you..."
<br />

<br />
"Why are you thanking me?"
<br />

<br />
"For being so kind of course."
<br />

<br />
"No worries, it was a break from the boredom so I should be thanking you."
<br />

<br />
Janus smiled as the woman left the room, it wasn't often he had a chance to talk anyone so easily. Naturally though he would not have the luxury of much rest, because when the door finally shut Iris awoke. This put his mind at ease, now he could find out just why she was still here, and more about what happened afterwards at Crushbone.
<br />

<br />
"I suppose I have a lot of explaining to do, like just who I am."
<br />

<br />
"My parent's said your name was Janus."
<br />

<br />
"What else did they happen to say about me?"
<br />

<br />
"Well they said they traveled with your parents a long time ago."
<br />

<br />
"Then you should know a little more, though I appear mostly human, I am also half dark elf."
<br />

<br />
"That's why I stayed here, I wanted to apologize for calling you a demon, and also to thank you for coming to save me."
<br />

<br />
"By now I'm use to being called such names, besides I couldn't exactly let a friend of the family's daughter be kept as a slave."
<br />

<br />
She was glad now that she finally had a chance to apologize, after all her parents had raised to do such. However, there was still something that Iris felt was missing. Something she felt she could do to ease both Janus's mind as well as her own.
<br />

<br />
"I should go now, do you mind if I come to see how your doing in the morning?"
<br />

<br />
"Of course not."
<br />

<br />
Before another word could be said Iris leaned over the bed and gave Janus a quick kiss on his cheek. With that done she quickly left the room leaving a dumbfounded Janus wondering just why she had done that. Sometimes he never could understand women, they always seemed to do things for no reason and without warning. The best he could describe it was they where unpredictable, and slightly strange.
<br />

<br />
Unbeknownst to all in the great city of Felwithe the dark elf trio had managed to track down just where their victim lay. They had in fact begun to plan their plan of action, either it was to lay in wait for the prey to show itself, or if they would sneak inside Felwithe itself and destroy the beast before their enemies eyes. Needless to say this was causing a slight conflict of choices between them.
<br />

<br />
"I say we find a way in and kill who or what it is."
<br />

<br />
"Your a fool, if we do that we risk being captured or killed, and where will that get us?"
<br />

<br />
"Afraid to say that he's right, the safest course of action is to lay in wait, that way no one will interfere."
<br />

<br />
"Very well, but letting our enemy rest is not wise."
<br />

<br />
"Wise or not, it's the safest and least suspicious way to act."
<br />

<br />
With that said, the decision was made, who or whatever had killed their fellow dark elves would die by their hand's when it left the city. No matter what it was they where prepared to face it, otherwise they would have a much larger mess to clear up, not just with Neriak, but with someone else. Someone they feared more than their own superiors.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Enjoy folks, I know its short, but its going to be an action packed chapter next time. Who knows you all might just see Zenki and Leona!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

Chapter 6
<br />

<br />
"Identity Revealed, A Dreamer Awakens."
<br />

<br />

<br />
Well its time yet again to write, I'm pretty sure everyone here has grown quite fond of Janus and Iris. So don't worry folks if this chapter doesn't contain them, I'm still sort of trying to figure out just which one to write on at this point in time. Maybe I'm getting to old for this...
<br />

<br />
For a long time a lone figure has watched over the people he had thrust into the horrors of facing things no mortal should. He had inadvertently caused the force that binds all reality to bestow unnatural abilities onto a boy who had just reached manhood. Further more he had to contend with the consequences that their descendants where drawing more attention by the darker forces. This ungod as some would call him was thankful that two simple humans had saved him, and as repayment he vowed to watch over and assist them in any way possible, for this bloodline had the power to save the gods, to restore that which the will of the eternity had created.
<br />

<br />
It was a miracle, it just had to be, but still even after so many days Leona was still in shock at what had happened. Some mysterious force had transported them to the eastern commons just near Freeport. She was thankful for this, mainly because Zenki was being treated at the clerics guild. At first though they where fearful, mostly because of a supposed legend of a demon with eyes with the blackness of death, and hair as crimson as the blood of a thousand slain men.
<br />

<br />
The door opened, and a dark elf woman quietly stepped in. This was very out of the ordinary since they where in Freeport and even more so was the fact that this was the woman's house. Leona had never heard of any dark elves being let live out in the open inside the city of Freeport, and even more so disturbing was the fact that she was readily accepted and liked by everyone who she talked to.
<br />

<br />
"How are you feeling today?"
<br />

<br />
"Much better, any word of....."
<br />

<br />
"Zenki will be fine, though the clerics are fearful of treating him, save one."
<br />

<br />
"How is it that you know his name, and why are you doing this for us, also just who are you?"
<br />

<br />
"Well I suppose you could say Zenki is my nephew, as for my name, I'm called Rita."
<br />

<br />
"How is this possible unless..."
<br />

<br />
"It is true that I'm married to human, though few seem to think so sometimes. I just wished you could meet Zenki's uncle and his cousin."
<br />

<br />
"Leave it to my parents to leave me in the dark on something I should have known about."
<br />

<br />
"I wouldn't except them to openly talk about my husband. To be honest I think they're afraid of him, much like most of the people who live in this city."
<br />

<br />
"Is that why everyone is so nice to you?"
<br />

<br />
"Actually it isn't, they think of us as night and day, so they are genuinely being kind, also since both my husband son help the local fighters train the majority hold a respect for them."
<br />

<br />
It was hard for Rita to believe the story that the clerics had told her at the guild. They all seemed to be deathly afraid of Zenki because of his appearance. All except for one, though she was still young she held no fear at all. This was all cleared up once the young woman told Rita just how the demon everyone was afraid of had saved her mother as well as her.
<br />

<br />
"How can you not be afraid, you've heard the legend!"
<br />

<br />
"I know I've heard that legend, and I seen what they called a demon first hand when I was a child."
<br />

<br />
"It let you live?!"
<br />

<br />
"Not only did it let me live, it also saved my mother and myself just as we where about to be killed."
<br />

<br />
For all they said none of the clerics could understand why their dear friend Nadia still wasn't afraid. Even the guards of the guild where afraid, and it for them to be rattled so badly just at the sight of someone was beyond belief. This excluded Sir William of course, since he was the one who told them the story of the demon.
<br />

<br />
For Zenki all he had was broken dreams, and nightmares of the battle with the demons he had fought in the Karanas. The only true time he had any rest was when he wasn't dreaming at all, the calm darkness in his mind comforted him. During all this time the Nadia had helped the clerics attending Zenki, she was the only one of them who dared to actually touch him.
<br />

<br />
All she could do was wander around the city, Leona remembered the time she spent at the guilds here learning from the trainers. In truth she liked this city better than most since she could find anything she wanted here. She hated the fact that even if she did want to leave she couldn't because of Zenki, but at least now she had the time to pick up a couple spell scrolls she had been wanting for awhile. Little did she know that something had followed her and Zenki to the city.
<br />

<br />
"Despicable humans, can't we just destroy them all?"
<br />

<br />
"Your so much like our brethren who fell in the Karanas, you underestimate these creatures."
<br />

<br />
"Can't we just use the dark elves like we've done on Faydwer?"
<br />

<br />
"This one must be handled personally, he's already become aware unlike the other."
<br />

<br />
Things definitely where not going to be peaceful in Freeport, two more demons had been sent out after it was learned the two others had failed miserably. Their superiors where both angry and disgraced that something could dispatch their lesser brethren. There also remained the fact that someone else was interfering, making things even more complicated.
<br />

<br />
Indeed someone was watching this whole scene from the shadows, and now it was becoming apparent that physical interference was going to be needed. From past experience he knew full well that Zenki was going to be unconscious for another day or so. Worst yet was now Freeport would be caught in the cross hairs when the foul creatures finally did decide to attack. This was something he couldn't stand for in the least, since his own family called this city their home, and in face he had grown quite fond of it as well.
<br />

<br />
All the city was oblivious to the oncoming threat, even Rita who had been tapping her contacts for every ounce of information they had. Who or whatever was behind the recent events was in fact being very careful of who they worked with. With her husband away all she could do was send word to Qeynos and hope that Leona's parents came to make a visit.
<br />

<br />
These hopes came true as there was a knock on the door, and none other than Zolf and Zinka quickly stepped inside. After having gotten word of how their daughter and Zenki where found they felt they had no other choice than to come. Not only that, but they didn't exactly trust her husband either, especially after the events in the past.
<br />

<br />
"So how is our daughter doing?"
<br />

<br />
"She's fine, but she hasn't said what happened."
<br />

<br />
"Dear, what about Zenki, is he all right?"
<br />

<br />
"Well he's recovering at the cleric's guild, and he looked like he had been through a war zone."
<br />

<br />
"And what of...."
<br />

<br />
"Oh our son is off to get some information on Faydwer, and his father is off traveling."
<br />

<br />
It was then that Leona finally walked in from her walk through the town, not surprised in the least that her parents had come. She was glad to see them, even if they had sent made her travel with Zenki. She still couldn't believe all that had happened though. Little did she or anyone else realize the fate that was about to befall Freeport as the sun began to set.
<br />

<br />
The guards near the clerics guild never knew what hit them as a flurry of clawed strikes shredded their armor before the razor sharp teeth of the Reapers ripped out their throats. For them this was pure pleasure, it has be so long since they had the opportunity to kill humans, so this task was much more to their liking. They took great pride in their abilities, and thought that sending the low classed incubae half breeds before was a mistake. The two where now intent on turning this night into a night of blood filled gore before they finished their job.
<br />

<br />
Sir William had just finished making his rounds, and it was his duty to escort which ever trainee's whom lived in Freeport from the cleric's guild to their homes for the night. Tonight it looked as if he had the pleasure of seeing Nadia to her home. Though, he wasn't expected to face the conversation that was about to take place.
<br />

<br />
"Sir William! How could you tell such stories of a demon when you know they aren't true!"
<br />

<br />
"Anything that monstrous has to be such a creature."
<br />

<br />
"When I was a child I seen him myself, and he was no demon!"
<br />

<br />
"I remember it well, it did harm me!"
<br />

<br />
"And didn't it also save Freeport when it was being overrun by those vile trolls and ogres?"
<br />

<br />
"That doesn't matter, I still think that man was a demon."
<br />

<br />
"Why must you always be so stubborn!"
<br />

<br />
"Young people are to trusting these days, you'll soon learn that."
<br />

<br />
As soon as they rounded a corner they befell the horror the Reapers had managed to cause. Blood and chunks of pink flesh littered the grown and slid down the walls. Pieces of bone and brain matter where all that was left of the guards heads. Nadia nearly fainted at seeing this sight, and Sir William did well to hold back the urge to vomit. It was then they spotted a set of glowing eyes in the darkness, and the glint of razor sharp teeth from a Reaper's grotesque mouth.
<br />

<br />
"Look, more lambs for the slaughter..."
<br />

<br />
"Yes... What things we can do to them..."
<br />

<br />
Before another word or action could be taken, a lone figure, shrouded in black garments stepped out from the shadows and stood directly in front of the two Reapers. Then the person turned towards Sir William and Nadia, both where speechless as they gazed upon the figures eyes. They where the same as the demon from the legend, solid black, like the shadows themselves.
<br />

<br />
"So Sir William how's the arm doing?"
<br />

<br />
"Your that boy from all those years back!"
<br />

<br />
"More or less, even now your scared out of your mind."
<br />

<br />
"Please, who ever you are, help us."
<br />

<br />
"So the child who called me a demon has grew up..."
<br />

<br />
The two Reapers where clearly insulted at hearing all of this, for anyone they deemed to be human or the like to be called a demon was insulting. This in turn resolved their decision to just what they would do to this person, having considered only maiming him for interrupting them before. They would get retribution for having been  insulted so greatly, first by killing him, then by destroying the humans whom he seemed to be protecting.
<br />

<br />
"You will die now foolish mortal!"
<br />

<br />
A Reaper thrust its clawed hand forward as black mana began to gather around the tips of its nails. All that could be seen was what could be described as a sinister smile from the creature as darkness seemed to encircle the man before them. Soon the mass of darkness burst into flames as both of the Reapers laughed in unison.
<br />

<br />
Nadia couldn't believe what had just happened before her, she was almost certain that who ever this person was, had now died before her eyes. What made things worse was the fact that she knew Sir William had no chance of fending off these beasts. To her there didn't seem to be a future, she felt she was now nearing the end of her stay on this mortal coil.
<br />

<br />
"You are the ones who are fools, you barely even singed my clothes."
<br />

<br />
The flames seemed to fold away from the figure, then disappear only to be replaced by a crimson incandescent aura. Laughing was all they could hear from beneath the cloth mask as the man finally pulled the garments away from his head. It was definitely the same person Nadia had seen before, no one else could have hair that same color, or have this much power.
<br />

<br />
"I will show you that I'm far worse than these creatures, then no one shall make the mistake of calling me a demon again."
<br />

<br />
Whatever this man was, the Reapers now knew that he wasn't a simple human. In all their years of slaughtering people they had never encountered someone like this. The silence of the moment was becoming unbearable, and then everyone felt it. The ground beneath them began to vibrate, and then the earth under the man's feet began to crack.
<br />

<br />
"I'll give you the pleasure of knowing your destructors name, I am called Ryo Kataoka."
<br />

<br />
It was then that Leona felt the small tremors from across the city, then she felt and overwhelming horror envelope her very being. The feeling was similar to when Zenki had fought before, but it was far stronger. She broke out into a cold sweat as she thought of what must be happening.
<br />

<br />
"It's Zenki! He has to be awake!"
<br />

<br />
"How can you..."
<br />

<br />
Before her father could utter another word Leona had ran from the house, heading directly for the cleric's guild. She wasn't sure why, but since Zenki was awake he might be causing untold destruction. Leona felt responsible for all of this somehow, though she wasn't sure why, the only thing she knew was she had to do something.
<br />

<br />
Naturally her parents and Rita had taken off after her, though they hated to admit it they had let themselves become out of shape and found themselves quickly falling behind. Leona's parents had a good idea of what might be happening, but they dared not say it to Rita. They just had to be sure of what was really going on.
<br />

<br />
Sir William was awestruck, never had he seen such a fierce fighter before. To make matters worse this was the same person he had heard was helping the monks train. This man named Ryo was actually enjoying the fight, and more so disturbing was it appeared he was toying with the creatures. For being so well built Sir William could hardly believe how nimble Ryo was.
<br />

<br />
"Despicable mortal... It is time I showed you just what we Reapers are capable of!"
<br />

<br />
"I was hoping you would have more than this, your much slower than I expected."
<br />

<br />
There was a hiss and then Ryo found out just what the Reapers had been holding back as all four of the Reaper's clawed limbs began to strike out. This was much more to Ryo's liking as the beasts nails only found nothing or a catch of clothing here or there. What he hadn't noticed was the other Reaper had slipped off into the shadows, with a task set in it's mind.
<br />

<br />
Leona in her haste had actually shoved open the door to the cleric's guild house, and had made her way through the guards trying to strain her to get to Zenki's room. When she seen the sleeping Zenki However, she was confused. All that ran through her mind was how she could be so wrong, and further more, what had caused her to feel the way she did.
<br />

<br />
Finally Ryo had noticed he was only fighting just one Reaper, his attention was drawn away for just a second, his mind wondering where the other had gotten to. Then it dawned on him just as one of the Reaper's razor sharp talons caught more than just cloth this time, leaving a thin cut across his cheek Now the creature had gone to far, it was no longer play time.
<br />

<br />
"Tiring are we, mortal?"
<br />

<br />
"You have just advanced from being my play toy, to now being a victim...."
<br />

<br />
Before the Reaper could make another move it found a punch landing square across its fast, and then another in the form of an uppercut connected with it's chin, sending the beast into the air. It had never felt attacks this intense before, bone had shattered upon contact and blood had sprayed out into the air. This in turn left splotches of blackened liquid over the street and walls, along with fragments of dark bone matter.
<br />

<br />
Nadia looked on slack jawed as she seen Ryo leap into the air, striking the grotesque creature back to the stone inlaid street below. He was like a man possessed, as thunderous blow after blow landed on the beasts body, sending skin and bone into the air as the force of each attack began to increase. The sheer magnitude of the strikes alone where causing the ground to shake violently as each attack connected.
<br />

<br />
"Not...pos...."
<br />

<br />
The Reaper didn't get the chance to finish what would be its last words as Ryo reached down with both his hands and grasped the monsters head between his hands. A sickening gurgle was heard from the beasts throat and then the snapping of bones as the creatures head seemed to explode in Ryo's hands. The next thing Sir William and Nadia saw was the now dead Reapers spine being torn from its body by Ryo's bare hands.
<br />

<br />
"It very well is possible, moronic creature!"
<br />

<br />
This all had given the now dead Reapers companion in bloodshed the time to find the cleric's guild, it was going to finish the task it was given. It was easy enough for it to slip through the shadows past the guards, not taking its time to marvel in the carnage it so wanted, as it rushed to find its target. Instead what it found was much more rewarding, as it seen a girl standing beside the bed of its would-be victim.
<br />

<br />
Leona couldn't even utter a word as the Reaper emerged from the shadows in the room. This was something that she could have never imagined in her worst nightmares, and yet here was this thing, standing the room, claws extended and ready to lay waste to whatever got in its way.
<br />

<br />
"It will be a pleasure to shred your flesh and crush your bones before I kill this boy."
<br />

<br />
The monstrous being fell on her with a speed unlike anything else she had seen before. All her mind could do was search for some way out, something or someone that might help her survive. Then her subconscious had found the solution as Leona spoke a barely audible sentence, it was now her only hope that it was heard.
<br />

<br />
"Zenki, please help me."
<br />

<br />
These words did not fall on deaf ears, Zenki had indeed heard them, and his mind was beginning to clear as another voice filled his head. It was a voice he had heard before somewhere, and now it was here once again to help him. Somehow he knew it was going to help him in what must be done.
<br />

<br />
- Zenki it is time to rise up and fight. -
<br />

<br />
- How do I wake up? It hurts if I even move, let alone fight. -
<br />

<br />
- You have the power, just use it, draw the strength you need to move from it. -
<br />

<br />
- I...... I'm afraid, I lost control before. -
<br />

<br />
- Just do what comes naturally, don't fight the urge, it's just a dream after all. -
<br />

<br />
It was then that Zenki's eyes opened, he simply thought this was another dream, or nightmare as he viewed the scene before him. What he saw was a being like none he had ever seen, and it was holding Leona in the air by her throat, ready to plunge its free arm into her body and tear her to pieces. This was something that even he couldn't let happen even if it was a dream.
<br />

<br />
"No you don't!"
<br />

<br />
Within a split second Leona saw Zenki roll forward out of the bed and leap into the air, before she could make out anything else she found herself hitting the floor. In fact Zenki had hit the Reaper with enough force to shove them both through the stone wall and down toward the street below. She was glad that he had her as she struggled to regain her breath.
<br />

<br />
"I'll kill you, and then I'll get to have the pleasure of killing her as well!"
<br />

<br />
"Go ahead and try!"
<br />

<br />
The Reaper moved forward, launching several attacks with all four of its limbs, trying desperately to satisfy its lust for blood. Instead it missed, only to leave itself wide open for what could only be deemed a foolish mistake on its part. The creature had underestimated what it thought was a boy, and now it was going to pay for that grievous error in judgment.
<br />

<br />
There was a quick movement, far to quick for the creature to anticipate as Zenki's leg connected with the side of one of its knee's. This in turn caused the joint to practically explode on contact from the impact, leaving the beast howling in pain, and again wide open for another attack. For once it appeared as Zenki was finally going to have an actual dream, rather than the nightmares he had experienced before.
<br />

<br />
Leona's parents had finally arrived at the Cleric's guild house, what they seen before them was surprising to them. They had never really seen a Reaper before, but they had found the chance to read scriptures describing their appearance. Indeed they could tell the material they read was in fact truthful, right down to their hideous appearance.
<br />

<br />
The Reaper soon found itself in far worse trouble than it ever could have before as Zenki shoved his elbow directly into its chest, only to snap his arm back up and strike at it's chin with the back of his fist. Then there was a flash of light before the creatures eyes as Zenki had pulled its face directly down into one of his knee's. The very next thing it could feel was a foot lodged in it's back that sent it into a nearby street wall.
<br />

<br />
As if he had done it many times before Zenki held out his hands, palms facing toward each other as barely visible aura surrounded his body. Then before Leona's Parents, as well as Rita they seen his arms part and a sphere of brilliant white light form between Zenki's palm's. They had all seen this attack before, and knew there was no hope of survival for the Reaper.
<br />

<br />
"Celestial Wake!"
<br />

<br />
The sphere had changed into a massive beam of energy that raced forward and struck the Reaper head on. Light filled the surrounding area as the Reaper's body was encompassed in the light, and then faded away as the light continued on up into the sky above Freeport and then dissipated. For the few who had seen this in the street's below they could have only described it as the reverse of a falling star.
<br />

<br />

<br />
I certainly hope this is to everyone's liking, and if its not then I guess I should try harder. Anyway feel free to tell me what you thought.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>
