3 notes, before you read. One, this is not the finished draft, so some things may change. Two the second scene is somewhat more grisly then usual. 3 for those wondering when I will hurry up and finish this and CR: The Movie Episode 2. I shall repeat ID Software's famous saying "When it's done." So without further chatting...

The Shadow Falls: Sign of the Void
<br />
-------------------
<br />

<br />
	For almost 500 years , I have watched Norrath changed, blossom and decay. Nations rise and fall...teachings are learned and forgotten. Unfortunately the latter happened to what my beloved tried to show to the world. The truth behind all things fell upon deaf ears...the 'gods' sway has gone undiminshed...but like all things.They changed. Through are offspring, the truth is starting to be spread once again. Maybe this generation can finally convince Norrath...or maybe it will fall tot eh wayside once again..maybe...regardless of what happens, the winds of change are blowing was once again and Norrath will never be the same.
<br />
--------------------
<br />

<br />
	Jesyca hated the underground caverns, they stunk like the pits of hell and were as dark as pitch.
<br />

<br />
|Why don't they ever clean these damn caverns?|
<br />

<br />
I have no idea Mika. You would think they would a city. a capital city no less as rich as Palsa could pay some one to clean it.
<br />

<br />
|Beauracrats..|
<br />

<br />
No kidding
<br />

<br />
|Jes..slow down a bit, i don't like this he has to be around here somewhere.|
<br />

<br />
Can't you sense his familiar?
<br />

<br />
|No..That scares me...I should be able to sense familiars|
<br />

<br />
I hate to admit it, but this is scaring me too..I almost wish that I had waited a bit..|
<br />

<br />
|Big bad Jes? scared? I'm shocked. Don't worry, You will do just fine, your more then ready to become th- DUCK!!!!|
<br />

<br />
Jesyca ducked at her famaliar's advice just a chain shot out of the shadows and sailed over her. She then rolled to the right, withdrawing her scimitar. A blue wolf appeared behind her running at high speed, it leapt and just as it was about to land on her back, it shimmered and in a flash of darkness, it was gone, and on Jesyca was suit of blue spiked armor.
<br />

<br />
Her breath drew short, as her eyes darted from side to side, trying to pierce the darkness searching for her target. 
<br />

<br />
|Calm down, Jesy, if your heart starts beating any faster and harder, you'll rattle off your armor.|
<br />

<br />
You would like that wouldn't you?
<br />

<br />
|I refrain to answer that..it might incriminate me..|
<br />

<br />
She smiled, but the smile faded as she noticed her that her breath was becoming visible, the mist hanging in the air because of the cold.
<br />

<br />
He's close.
<br />

<br />
|Your armor is rattling...|
<br />

<br />
I'm scared.......I'm not ready for this!!!!
<br />

<br />
"Too late to run now" Spoke a deep voice behind her. She wheeled around swinging her scimitar at the voice, it exploded as it touched a fiery red cloak. She gasped then cried out, as two chains arced out of the shadows and collided with her armor,  shattering it with the familiar armor, leaving her in nothing but her burlap under clothing. Another flash of darkness went off, catapulting her backwards flying through the air.
<br />

<br />
|JESY!!!|
<br />

<br />
Four more chains  harpooned out the darkness,  each of the chains buried themselves into her wrists and ankles, then hoisted her up off the ground, spread eagling her.
<br />

<br />
A cold, deep voice laugh crept out of the darkness, a tall shape stepped out. The majority of the figure couldn't be out by the pain wracked girl, but she could very clearing make out the fiery cape and cowl.
<br />

<br />
Mika....Help me!!!!!
<br />

<br />
The black wolf, appearing at her side, charged the tall figure. The wolf leapt it's teeth bared, and was shredded by a barrage of chains through it's body. The mutilated body crashed tot he ground, just barely alive.
<br />

<br />
|jesy...I'm sorry.....I've failed y-|
<br />

<br />
The wolf howled as it exploded into flames.
<br />

<br />
|MIKA!!  M ika!! answer me!!!!!!!!! Say something!!!!!!!!!!|
<br />

<br />
The figure laughed again. 
<br />

<br />
"Your familiar is gone girl, as you will be. But you will not be so fortunate as it. I intend on savoring your soul."
<br />

<br />
"YOU..bas... I'll kill you!!!"
<br />

<br />
The figure responded with several lashes from hiss shadow chains, they bit into her flesh making her scream in pain. Another barrage tore off some of her flesh and what little clothing she had left on.
<br />

<br />
The figure smiled. He moved up to her, and with his hand clutched her face. 
<br />

<br />
"Such beauty.I shall savor every moment of ecstasy, every second of exquisite pain." to make his point, the chains began to retract slowly.
<br />

<br />
She screamed and then spat into his face. "Do you what want!! You and I both know that you aren't a true Hell Lord!! You may have beaten me!! But you will always be a Mal'shak!! You never could claim the title!!! You could never beat -"
<br />

<br />
The figure's eyes flashed with anger and the chains penetrating her body, glowed white hot,  illicitly another scream for Jesyca. Another chain leapt out of the darkness and smashed into her, feeling like she had been punched in the left arm. The other chains vacated her body and she slumped ot the floor. When she made to get up, she gaspd..but she couldn't scream any more...her arm...her left arm was gone..only a constant spurt of blood.
<br />

<br />
The figure began to talk..but not to her..Just to the darkness as if some one else was there.
<br />

<br />

<br />
"You robbed me of my destiny..My chance to go to Jahorn..." A spiked chain shot out and pierced through Jesyca's neck and out of the other side, it retracted slight and she felt barbs at the back of her head as she grasped in disbelif at the chain in front of her, buried in her neck.
<br />

<br />
"But I can feel you out there..taunting me...I can feel your power....Every moment.you grow stronger....as do I....soon...we shall meet...and I shall claim my birth right...."
<br />

<br />
The chain retracted rapidly. Jesyca felt no pain... she tumbled forward, finding her slef looking at the feet of the figure....the Hell Lord of Palsa Maxim..as he walked off into the shadows, she heard another thump..and something fell into her view...her twitching headless body. 
<br />

<br />
	Just the last light faded from her, she heard one last word.
<br />

<br />
".....Raziel."

Gnomish fireworks sail into the air and explode to the cheers of  hundreds of people and blaring music, illuminating the sky.

{Welcome to Sunday Night Gladiators!!!, 1 mile above the Oasis of Marr in the largest floating arena in Norrath!!!!!! Hi I am Dayn Owens and to my right is, Hermi Pots and we are here to bring you all the deetails, and moment by monet commentary on the greatest show in existence!!!}

{And we are starting things with abang tonight! First up is a title defense!! and boy is it a doozy!! We are kicking the show off with a defense of the Norrath championship!! and coming down the ramp now is the challenger Commander Slate!!!}
<br />

<br />
A large muscular human, enters the massive arena pyrotechnics going off behind him. He raises his arms in celebration, driving the group into greater hieghts of hysterics
<br />

<br />
{I like Co Slate, but personally I think he is way over his head. No one has beaten the champion yet. }

{I'd have to agree with ya there, but yo0u never knowwhat may happen on SNG}

<br />

<br />
{And her shee comes!! The reigning undeafted cchampion!! The mean lean fighting machine...AquaMarine!!!}
<br />

<br />
An armored figure steps out, the arena lights up as countless flashes of cameras goes of, shining brightly off the  light blue form fighting hard suit of Aquamarine. The crowd goes insane, as two panels at the the shoulder blades of the hard suit open up, jutting out 90 degrees. Aqua marine crouches,  an immense flare shoots out of the panels , propelling Aquamarine forward into a breakneck dash down the ramp.. The thruster then suddenly cut out, she falls forward intoa several twisting hand springs forward. On the last hand spring,she pushes up, and rights her self, the thrusters kick in again, and she connects to Slate with a tremondous Arial whirlwind kind.
<br />

<br />

<br />
--------------------------
<br />

<br />
Wow, Aquamarine is tough.
<br />

<br />
|She's ok.|
<br />

<br />
Like to see you do that.
<br />

<br />
|Fat chance.|
<br />

<br />
Thought so old man
<br />

<br />
|I may be old but I can still kick your butt!!!|
<br />

<br />
I am so scared..I wuake att the thought of you batting me with your paw.|
<br />

<br />
|You know in my day, people actually respected their grandpa.|
<br />

<br />
Tough noogies
<br />

<br />
With the last remark, Reyas batted the young boy in the head withhis paw.
<br />

<br />
"ow!"
<br />

<br />
|You deserve it. Now do you want to pay off the airship or not?"
<br />

<br />
Of course...though I don't see why I have to do the hard part? it's your fault that it broke in the first place.
<br />

<br />
|It is not!!! I was just walking there!! Even if it was my fault...which it is not. You don't expect your poor old granpa to do hard labor now do you?|
<br />

<br />
Oh so now you are old and wornout?
<br />

<br />
|O yes..O my back...O ah..ee oi! How does that sound?|
<br />

<br />
Hmph!
<br />

<br />
|Being  more then several millenia old has it's benifits|
<br />

<br />
So I am learning...Alright..I'l go get ready. You go place the bet. And no stopping at the Casino this time!!
<br />

<br />
|You have no faith in me Nall...sniff.....|
<br />

<br />
You better believe it! Now promise!!
<br />

<br />
|Alright I promise I wont stop at the Casino.|
<br />

<br />
And...
<br />

<br />
|..the bar..|
<br />

<br />
And!!!
<br />

<br />
|...the Hall of  Bare Nekkid Elves....Man! you are no fun.| With a sigh, the silver winged cat Reyas, hopped off the  Nall's shoulder and disappeared around the corner.

<br />
So after making you wait a very long time. SOTV is finally here!! you may now praise me . One little note before you start enjoying, as always there music cues in SOTV. but you may notice that most them can be found on either WWF: The Music Volume 5 or WWF Tough Enough: Trax Unleashed. I just want to assure you that it is purely concidental and I was not paid $5,000 for the shameless advertising....maybe (But you'll never know for sure, now will you )
<br />
So without further ado... It's story time!!!
<br />
-----------------------
<br />

<br />
For almost 500 years , I have watched Norrath changed, blossom and decay. Nations rise and fall...teachings are learned and forgotten. Unfortunately the latter happened to what my beloved tried to show to the world. The truth behind all things fell upon deaf ears...the 'gods' sway has gone undiminished...but like all things. They changed. Through our offspring, the truth is starting to be spread once again. Maybe this generation can finally convince Norrath...or maybe it will fall tot eh wayside once again..maybe...regardless of what happens, the winds of change are blowing was once again and Norrath will never be the same.
<br />
--------------------
<br />

<br />
Kyt hated the underground caverns, they stunk like the pits of hell and were as dark as pitch.
<br />

<br />
|Why don't they ever clean these damn caverns?|
<br />

<br />
I have no idea Mika. You would think they would a city, A capital city, no less as rich as Palsa could pay some one to clean it.
<br />

<br />
|Beauracrats..|
<br />

<br />
No kidding 
<br />

<br />
|Kyt..slow down a bit, I don't like this he has to be around here somewhere.|
<br />

<br />
Can't you sense his familiar?
<br />

<br />
|No..That scares me...I should be able to sense familiars|
<br />

<br />
I hate to admit it, but this is scaring me too..I almost wish that I had waited a bit..|
<br />

<br />
|Big bad Kyt? scared? I'm shocked. Don't worry, You will do just fine, your more then ready to become th- DUCK!!!!|
<br />

<br />
Kyt ducked at her familiar&#8217;s advice just a chain shot out of the shadows and sailed over her. She then rolled to the right, withdrawing her scimitar. A blue wolf appeared behind her running at high speed, it leapt and just as it was about to land on her back, it shimmered and in a flash of darkness, it was gone, and upon Kyt was suit of blue spiked armor.
<br />

<br />
Her breath drew short, as her eyes darted from side to side, trying to pierce the darkness searching for her target. 
<br />

<br />
|Calm down, Kyt, if your heart starts beating any faster and harder, you'll rattle off your armor.|
<br />

<br />
You would like that wouldn't you?
<br />

<br />
| I refrain to answer that..it might incriminate me..|
<br />

<br />
She smiled, but the smile faded as she noticed her that her breath was becoming visible, the mist hanging in the air because of the cold.
<br />

<br />
He's close.
<br />

<br />
|Your armor is rattling...|
<br />

<br />
I'm scared.......I'm not ready for this!!!!
<br />

<br />
"Too late to run now" Spoke a deep voice behind her. She wheeled around, swinging her scimitar at the voice, it exploded as it touched a fiery red cloak. She gasped then cried out, as two chains arced out of the shadows and collided with her armor, shattering the familiar armor, leaving her in nothing but her burlap under clothing. Another flash of darkness went off, catapulting her backwards flying through the air.
<br />

<br />
|KYT!!!|
<br />

<br />
Four more chains harpooned out the darkness, each of the chains buried themselves into her wrists and ankles, then hoisted her up off the ground, spread eagling her.
<br />

<br />
A cold, deep voice laugh crept out of the darkness, a tall shape stepped out. The majority of the figure couldn't be made out by the pain wracked girl, but she could very clearing make out the fiery cape and cowl.
<br />

<br />
Mika....Help me!!!!!
<br />

<br />
The blue wolf, appearing at her side, charged the tall figure. The wolf leapt it's teeth bared, and was shredded by a barrage of chains through it's body. The mutilated body crashed tot he ground, just barely alive.
<br />

<br />
|Kyt...I'm sorry.....I've failed y-|
<br />

<br />
The wolf howled as it exploded into flames.
<br />

<br />
MIKA! Mika!! Answer me!!!!!!!!! Say something!!!!!!!!!!
<br />

<br />
The figure laughed again. 
<br />

<br />
"Your familiar is gone girl, as you will be. But you will not be so fortunate as it. I intend on savoring your soul."
<br />

<br />
"YOU..bas... I'll kill you!!!"
<br />

<br />
The figure responded with several lashes from his shadow chains, they bit into her flesh making her scream in pain. Another barrage tore off some of her flesh and what little clothing she had left on.
<br />

<br />
The figure smiled. He moved up to her, and with his hand clutched her face. 
<br />

<br />
"Such beauty.I shall savor every moment of ecstasy, every second of exquisite pain." to make his point, the chains began to retract slowly.
<br />

<br />
She screamed and then spat into his face. "Do you what want!! You and I both know that you aren't a true Hell Lord!! You may have beaten me!! But you will always be a Mal'shak!! You never could claim the title!!! You could never beat -"
<br />

<br />
The figure's eyes flashed with anger and the chains penetrating her body, glowed white hot, eliciting another scream for Kyt. Another chain leapt out of the darkness and smashed into her, feeling like she had been punched hard in the left shoulder. The other chains vacated her body and she slumped to the floor. When she made to get up, she gasped..but she couldn't scream any more...her arm...her left arm was gone..only a constant spurt of blood.
<br />

<br />
The figure began to talk..but not to her..Just to the darkness as if some one else was there.
<br />

<br />

<br />
"You robbed me of my destiny..My chance to go to Jahorn..." A spiked chain shot out and pierced through Kyt's neck and out of the other side, it retracted slight and she felt barbs at the back of her head as she grasped in disbelief at the chain in front of her, buried in her neck.
<br />

<br />
"But I can feel you out there..taunting me...I can feel your power....Every moment. you grow stronger....as do I....soon...we shall meet...and I shall claim my birth right...."
<br />

<br />
The chain retreated back into the darkness. Kyt felt no pain... she tumbled forward, finding her self looking at the feet of the figure....the Hell Lord of Palsa, Maxim..as he walked off into the shadows, she heard another thump..and something fell into her view...her twitching headless body. 
<br />

<br />
Just the last light faded from her, she heard one last word.
<br />

<br />
".....Raziel."
<br />
-----------------------------------
<br />

<br />
A black crescent wave carved the air and into a dozen undead which where immediately disintegrated. But even more took up the fallen's place, all the while still moaning from eternal agony.
<br />

<br />
"Dread.....Dread.....Join us.......Dread!!!!!!!!"
<br />

<br />
The zombies continued up the hill, pushing through the onslaught undaunted until they came upon an invisible barrier. The zombies howled in pain as the barrier scorched them. On the other side of barrier, a cloaked figure approached the howling zombies, extending an arm. Black hot flames ignited on his arm and a beamed pulsed out destroying the mob of zombies pressed against the barrier.
<br />

<br />
The shrouded figure, stepped through to the other side of the barrier into the large gap in the mob of zombies. The zombies closed in encircling the figure, but then suddenly they stopped and didn't close in any further. The figure looked around searching for someone or something. Obviously getting agitated, the figure pulled back the hood of the cloak, revealing a black skinned elf.
<br />

<br />
"I tire of this Dread King!!! Show yourself!!"
<br />

<br />
The zombies encircling the black elf, began to speak, but instead of the normal moan and chants, they began to speak as one, in a cold almost distant voice.
<br />

<br />
"Try as... you might Dirk..... You will never..... be able to hold..... me back forever..."
<br />

<br />
"That remains to be seen! You have been trying for 18 years unsuccessfully! You will never enter the temple."
<br />

<br />
"...maybe so...but I need not...enter the ruins..to complete my goal......and even Tunare's.....last wish...will not protect..this mountain forever...soon...soon....Dirk Lunas....."
<br />

<br />
"Hmph. You are over confident. You will never pierce the barrier. You are too weak. I and others have beaten countless times before and will continue to do so."
<br />

<br />
The zombies began to laugh, even Dirk had to shudder at the sound of unnatural sound of thousands of undead laughing as one.
<br />

<br />
"My corporeal form may be destroyed....but I will always return...but even so....my new form....will be able to contain...all of my power......not just a token...like Veeshan&#8217;s gift......"
<br />

<br />
"New form?"
<br />

<br />
"In all this time..you do not understand...."
<br />

<br />
The zombies began to laugh again.
<br />

<br />
"Soon.....the child's soul and corporeal bind...will belong..to me..just ....as the soul and corporeal bind of the..... mother belongs to Palsa......"
<br />

<br />
"NEVER!!!" 
<br />

<br />
The ground surrounding Dirk crackled and then detonated incinerating everything within a quarter mile forward of the barrier. Even with the zombies gone, the voice of the Dread King still spoke.
<br />

<br />
"Soon...you will see.....Dirk........Lunas......."
<br />

<br />

<br />
Then the voice went silent, and the hairs on the back of Dirk's head stopped standing on end, indicating the retreat of the Dread King's influence. He shuddered slightly, then turned around and passed back through the barrier. as he walked back up the mountain in the ButcherBlock range, to Tunare's forgotten temple, his thoughts began to drift.. 
<br />

<br />
Jesica....I miss you so much..When I have fulfilled my promise...I will avenge you...I will not rest until I have his -
<br />

<br />
"Papa! Papa!!!" A small girl appeared out of the temple, and dashed down to greet Dirk. The girl was met with open arms and scooped and lifted into the air.
<br />

<br />
"Whee!!!!" she cheered as Dirk twirled around a bit with a large smile Slowing down to a stop, he brought her to his chest and the girl gave him a tight hug around the neck.
<br />

<br />
"ack..not so tight Trini." He said feigning ..slightly
<br />

<br />
"Sorry."
<br />

<br />
"Trini what are you doing up here, you know you aren't supposed to come up here when the zombies approach the temple."
<br />

<br />
"I know..but the barrier never lets them through..and even if they did your so strong Papa!!" She said with big eyes swelled with adoration.
<br />

<br />
"Yes, I am..but just the same, I don't want you up here when they approach. you're all I have left in the world Trini. now promise me you won't come up here again when the zombies appear."
<br />

<br />
" I prom-" Suddenly she shrieked and began to tremble..A cold wave passed over Dirk..he could feel what Trini was feeling. Power...raw unequaled , indescribable power..
<br />

<br />
"Papa!! What is it!?!" Trini said between a combination of shakes and tears."
<br />

<br />
"I can feel it..A storm.... it's coming."

<br />
Gnomish fireworks sail into the air and explode to the cheers of hundreds of people and blaring music, illuminating the sky.
<br />

<br />
{Welcome to Sunday Night Gladiators!!!, 1 mile above the Oasis of Marr in the largest floating arena in Norrath!!!!!! Hi I am Dayn Owens and to my right is, Hermi Pots and we are here to bring you all the details, and moment by moment color commentary on the greatest show in existence!!!}

{And we are starting things with a bang tonight! First up is a title defense!! and boy is it a doozy!! We are kicking the show off with a defense of the Norrath championship!! Coming down the ramp now is the challenger ..... Commander Slate!!!}
<br />

<br />
A large muscular human, enters the massive arena pyrotechnics going off behind him. He raises his arms in celebration, driving the group into greater heights of hysterics
<br />

<br />
{I like Co Slate, but personally I think he is way over his head. No one has beaten the champion yet. }
<br />

<br />
{I'd have to agree with ya there, but you never know what may happen on SNG}

<br />
{And her she comes!! The reigning undefeated champion!! The mean lean fighting machine...AquaMarine!!!}
<br />

<br />
{Speaking of machines. Dayn, did you know to wear hard suits, that each suit must be custom fitted tot he wearers body to make an exact fit for the neuro contacts? Obviously making it forming fitting.}
<br />

<br />
{I'm a married man..I am happily married man...}
<br />

<br />
{And because of the amount of neuro-connection to provide maximum amount of response. The wearer must have nothing underneath the hard suit?}
<br />

<br />
{Married Man...Happy, Happy married man!}
<br />

<br />
An armored figure steps out, the arena lights up as countless flashes of cameras goes of, shining brightly off the light blue, form fighting hard suit of Aquamarine. The crowd goes insane, as two panels at the shoulder blades of the hard suit open up, jutting out 90 degrees. Aqua marine crouches, an immense flare shoots out of the panels , propelling Aquamarine forward into a breakneck dash down the ramp.. The thruster then suddenly cut out, she falls forward into a several twisting hand springs forward. On the last hand spring, she pushes up, and rights her self, the thrusters kick in again, and she connects to Slate with a tremendous Arial whirlwind kind.
<br />

<br />

<br />
--------------------------
<br />

<br />
Wow, Aquamarine is tough.
<br />

<br />
|She's ok.|
<br />

<br />
Like to see you do that.
<br />

<br />
|Fat chance.|
<br />

<br />
Thought so old man
<br />

<br />
|I may be old but I can still kick your butt!!!|
<br />

<br />
I am so scared..I quake at the thought of you batting me with your paw.|
<br />

<br />
|You know in my day, people actually respected their grandpa.|
<br />

<br />
Tough noogies
<br />

<br />
With the last remark, Reyas batted the young boy in the head with his paw.
<br />

<br />
"ow!"
<br />

<br />
|You deserve it. Now do you want to pay off the airship or not?"
<br />

<br />
Of course...though I don't see why I have to do the hard part? it's your fault that it broke in the first place.
<br />

<br />
|It is not!!! I was just walking there!! Even if it was my fault...which it is not. You don't expect your poor old Granpa to do hard labor now do you?|
<br />

<br />
Oh so now you are old and wornout?
<br />

<br />
|O yes..O my back...O ah..ee oi! How does that sound?|
<br />

<br />
Hmph!
<br />

<br />
|Being more then several millennia old has it's benefits|
<br />

<br />
So I am learning...Alright..I'l go get ready. You go place the bet. And no stopping at the Casino this time!!
<br />

<br />
|You have no faith in me Nall...sniff.....|
<br />

<br />
You better believe it! Now promise!!
<br />

<br />
|Alright I promise I won&#8217;t stop at the Casino.|
<br />

<br />
And...
<br />

<br />
|..the bar..|
<br />

<br />
And!!!
<br />

<br />
|...the Hall of Scantily Clad Elves....Man! you are no fun.| With a sigh, the silver winged cat Reyas, hopped off the Nall's shoulder and disappeared around the corner.
<br />
---------------------------
<br />

<br />
A door chirps.
<br />

<br />
"Enter."
<br />

<br />
A gnome holding a data assistant pad, enters the dark room and stands in front of a large oak desk, staring at the back of the chair of the Director of En-gen. A small puff of smoke drifts up from behind the chair. A flash of lightning goes off, illuminating the dark room.
<br />

<br />
"Could this be any more of a cliche? You have to much free time boss."
<br />

<br />
The man in the chair laughed, then thumbed a button on his chair. The room illuminated, the tv in front of him disappears into the ceiling, the smoke generator on the top of chair, retracted into the chair, and the chair it self shurnk down to 3/4 it's previous size as does the table. The chair swings around to face the gnome holding the D.A.P, revealing a Halfling. 
<br />

<br />
"So what do you have to report to me Shamus?"
<br />

<br />
"Well, we have run into a lot of snags sir."
<br />

<br />
"What type of snags?"
<br />

<br />
"Unfortunately. A majority of the targets for the Next-Generation Special Forces Ghost program and Lilith, have proved either unattainable or decayed beyond use."
<br />

<br />
"Explain."
<br />

<br />
The gnome sighed deeply. "Prepare for a mouthful."
<br />

<br />
"We have nothing but time Shamus."
<br />

<br />
"I'll start with target Number 1. Dirk Lunas. Display on."
<br />

<br />
A laser projection hovers in midair, it showed an array of symbols and numbers and in the center a picture of Dirk, then it switched to an aerial view of Faydwer.
<br />

<br />
"We dispatched a lance of troops to physically acquire a sample, but they where totally anniallated and turned by the undead. They never even got close, only about 500 feet into the continent."
<br />

<br />
"Why were physical troops dispatched? Why no the drones?"
<br />

<br />
"They couldn't get close."
<br />

<br />
The aeriel view zoomed into the ButcherBlock mountains, then into some temple ruins.
<br />

<br />
"Dirk Lunas.He has been sighted by our aeriel surveillance units to live here, but unfortunately, there is some kind of barrier protecting the temple from the undead and the Dread King. Whatever it is, it has been destroying our drones, and the few times he actually leaves the barrier, his MT aura destroys the drones as well. It's a losing situation."
<br />

<br />
"So he's out of the picture. What about 2?"
<br />

<br />
"Same reason, except the child never leaves the barrier."
<br />

<br />
"3?"
<br />

<br />
The projection shifted, revealing a picture of young Erudite.
<br />

<br />
"Raziel Eom'brn.We haven't been able to find him or a body. which is disappointing because from what we have been able to extract from texts. He would have been a valuable addition. But he just seemed to disappear off the face of Norrath after the destruction of Erudin."
<br />

<br />
"4?"
<br />

<br />
"Unlike the that range in the Butcherblock mountains, there was no barrier around the ruins of Old Felwithe. but when the drones searched the burial tomb. There where no remains. So either they where moved with the flight or they where turned by the dread King."
<br />

<br />
"5?"
<br />

<br />
The projection switched to a figure shrouded into a fiery cloak.
<br />

<br />
"Maxim Tidias. The current Hell Lord of Palsa, we where able to obtain a sample from him. it was actually quite easy, we didn&#8217;t even have to send a drone near him to get it. we has some interesting..to say the least..rituals....which inflicts upon himself everyday..like this"
<br />

<br />
"Spare me the details. What have you extrapolated?"
<br />

<br />
"His MTA levels are well beyond anything we have ever seen. His markers are a perfect addition to the Ghosts and Lilith."
<br />

<br />
"Very good."
<br />

<br />
"There is one thing you should know about his rituals."
<br />

<br />
"yes?"
<br />

<br />
"Well, I won't bore you with the details. But what it entails is the maintenance of a corpse."
<br />

<br />
"So?"
<br />

<br />
"The drone was able to extract some samples of Dirk from the corpse."
<br />

<br />
"Really? What was extrapolated?"
<br />

<br />
"Not much. Unfortunately, whatever preservation techniques Maxim is using. It didn&#8217;t preserve the sample very well. 97% of it was decayed beyond recognition. The rest that was decodable was pretty much junk."
<br />

<br />
""So aside from the Hell Lord, do we have any good materiel for the projects?"
<br />

<br />
"Well there is one thing. It does have a lot of promise."
<br />

<br />
The projection shifted once again, this time to the cast of Sunday Night Gladiators. The projection then zooms in on the entry ramp as Nall enters, pyrotechnics going off behind him. Shamus made a quick adjustment, muting the sound, as the music was blaring quite loudly.
<br />

<br />
"When we did the 'steroid testing' for this young apparent half-elf,like we do all the athletes. We came upon something interesting."
<br />

<br />
"Which is?"
<br />

<br />
"Well. 75% of his profile is elven, and of that, there is nothing truly special. but the last 25% is a type in which we have never encountered before. And what ever it is, its potential is unbelievable."
<br />

<br />
"Any speculations?"
<br />

<br />
"Not really, after combing the database, there isn&#8217;t a single thing that even comes close to matching the profile.. But if we to take a clue from the his fighting name and the fact that he has wings..."
<br />

<br />
"Quite stalling!!"
<br />

<br />
"It may be a dragon profile."
<br />

<br />
"Dragon!?!"
<br />

<br />
"yes. But this is pure speculation, but from what we know fro old texts, it may be well possible. And"
<br />

<br />
The projection shifted to a security camera. At first the screen was filled with an assortment of scantily clad and bare elven women dancing to strobe lights and unheard music. The camera then zoomed in on one of the women doing a table dance, then the camera panned down to the table top. On the table was a silver winged cat.
<br />

<br />
" What is that?"
<br />

<br />
"this is purely speculation but, seeing how that cat or whatever it is, is almost always hanging around the boy, and what little we have from texts. It's possible that, the frisky kitten on the screen may be an ancestor, in essence a full fledged dragon..in a reduced form obviously." 
<br />

<br />
"My, my. Things are looking up. Get another sample of the boy, and try to capture or get at least get sample of that..whatever it is."
<br />

<br />
"Yes,sir"
<br />

<br />
Shamus had the display, wink out and moved to exit the office.
<br />

<br />
"Shamus, one more thing. How goes the progress in claiming the 'item' for Lilith?"
<br />

<br />
"Unsuccessful sir. Negotiations with the Selvatorian government have been halted and fruitless. We had planning on dispatching the Ghosts, to acquire it by force."
<br />

<br />
"Keep that has a back up plan, I have an idea. Lets see just how potent the boy's dragon side is..."
<br />

<br />
---------------------------------
<br />

<br />
|Bet's placed Nall. Remember the plan.|
<br />

<br />
I know! Why are you reminding me? It was my idea.....minus the part in which I get beat up....
<br />

<br />
|Well, it's what happens when you break your airship.|
<br />

<br />
You broke the airship!!!
<br />

<br />
|Details..Details.|
<br />

<br />
So what are the odds at the moment?
<br />

<br />
|5-2 favor of Magus.|
<br />

<br />
That's definatly no going to cover the repairs..
<br />

<br />
|No kidding, your going to have to fake it till at least 10.|
<br />

<br />
Man....here we go. Magus is heading in..
<br />

<br />
(Music Cue: Dragula: Rob Zombie)
<br />

<br />
{And here comes one half of the Demolition squad. Magus Shenron!!}
<br />

<br />
A large 8 foot, very ugly human enters the ring. Pyrotechnics go off in the arena, the smoke trails, creating a large M. The crowd is in hysterics.
<br />

<br />
{Man. Magus is one powerful guy, but man is he ugly. he's got a face that even a mother couldn't love! But that what's happened when your mom is a Troll}
<br />

<br />
{Hey, Now that isn't right. Insult the wrestlers, but leave family out of it.}
<br />

<br />
{I wasn't insulting his mom, she really is a Troll, his dad his human, his mom is a troll.}
<br />

<br />
{You mean..someone actually.....eeewwww...}
<br />

<br />
Magus continues on down the entrance ramp arms high.
<br />

<br />
{and here comes the new kid who has been lighting things up over the last week. Nall Tayus aka... KID DRACO!!!}
<br />

<br />

<br />
Nall enters from behind a black curtain, gingerly. He turns around briefly shaking his rear at the crowd, eliciting cheers from the women in the audience. He then leaps into the air turning back to face the crowd, with an arm raised in triumph he shots.
<br />

<br />
"BAM!!" 
<br />

<br />
Pyro ignites briefly obscuring him then begins to ignite in stages going down the ramp entry ramp. As the pyro begins to cycle back up the sides of the ramp, Nall lands flexes eliciting more cheers from the women in the audience and starts down toward the arena.
<br />

<br />
| Remember, let him have the advantage, but not to much or they will put a hold on the betting odds.|
<br />

<br />
Yeah. Yeah.
<br />

<br />
A gong sounds as Nall was at the bottom of the ramp flicking the bang of red hair on his forehead, driving the women wild.
<br />

<br />
What was that ?
<br />

<br />
|The start gong|
<br />

<br />
Oh....CR-
<br />

<br />

<br />
"YOUR MINE KID!!!!" Magus shouts as scoops Nall in a bear hug and begins to squeeze.
<br />

<br />
{Oh man!! Magus has got the kid in his infamous hug of bone cracking!!}
<br />

<br />
{I guess he should have spent less time showing off and a little more time paying attention on what Magus was doing. I say this Kid has is behind 6-1 at the moment.}
<br />

<br />
{I'd have to agree.. Oh Look!! The Kid has broke loose!! Alright kid!!! Hey why is he beginning to glow?}
<br />

<br />
{Looks like the Kid is warming up! So far as we have seen in the last week, he really hates to get in close in these fights. He prefers to take his opponents down with mana based attacks. But think for a minute that he can't fight close up.}
<br />

<br />

<br />
Nall begins to glow fiercely as mana begins to gather around him. Suddenly he the mana flows stops and he with his fist he strikes the arena floor.
<br />

<br />
"MANA WAVE!!!!!!!" A blue wave of energy erupts and streaks toward Magus. Magus glows yellow briefly then unleashes his own mana attack.
<br />

<br />
"GROUND QUAKER!!!"
<br />

<br />
The swell of yellow mana collides and then consumes Nall's attack and before Nall could react the swell consumed him, singing him and burning some of his clothes. For an interminable time, Nall was in pain. That was all that existed pain...endless pain...then it was gone. He could see somewhat, but the smoke from his burnt clothes stung his eyes. He could barely make out the lumbering form of Magus coming toward him. The shape got closer and closer.. then he felt the air leave his lungs, a fist was buried deep in his stomach, then in his face, then nothing once again. He could feel air rush past him, that weird weightless feeling of flight...then he cried out once again as he found himself slamming into the crowd protection shield. The stinging of the shields energy snapped him to full consciousness.
<br />

<br />
Oh that hurt...How are the odds Granpa?
<br />

<br />
|Those can't be real! |
<br />

<br />
Huh? Of course this fight is real. Don't be silly. How are the odds? Can I beat this guy yet?
<br />

<br />
|They are!...... So soft..........|
<br />

<br />
Huh.........GRANPA!!!! 
<br />

<br />
|?? Nall??? oops...I should pay attention to what I think|
<br />

<br />
YOU PROMISED!!
<br />

<br />
|I did no such thing|
<br />

<br />
You promised just before you placed the bet!! You did place the bet didn't you!?!
<br />

<br />
|Yes, I placed the bet!! And I said I would not go to the Casino, Bar or Hall of Scantily Clad Elves...I made no such promise about the Hall of Bare Nekkid Elves.|
<br />

<br />
O for crying outloud!!!! YOU-You old horny dragon!! Would you just pay attention to the betting odds!
<br />

<br />
|Alright Alirght..sheesh...And I am not old!!!|
<br />
---------------------
<br />

<br />
A thousand years away, buried deep beneath the surface of Norrath. A consciousness awakens for the first time. For the first time it begins to look out, searching.....just to explore the world around it. For a millennia the consciousness spread out understanding it's environment and itself. Only as the things came into perspective did the consciousness realize that it was alive, and what it was. As it turned inward and explored the surrounding of skin and sinew that held it to this plane, it looked at every par t of the form. Exploring and pondering every inch, every hair, every finger, every leg...Everything in its entirety. It pondered each part and understood each part so thoroughly , that it became them. and for the first time it looked upon its world through its eyes.
<br />

<br />
At first everything was blurry, then slowly came into view. The world was soft...almost......like a liquid.... yes that seemed to be the right word, the mind decided. The eyes looked upon more of its surroundings, it saw some shapes a few inches from it. It focused on the shapes and read them with much happiness. A flush of elation ran through it, it was it's first word.
<br />

<br />

<br />
LILITH
<br />

<br />
The mind thought upon the word with happiness. It liked the word. It was nice. It decided to call itself that. Lilith. That was nice. As it pondered the word even more, it noticed some movement just beyond the floating word.. Lilith focused in on the movement, the moving shape came into focus. It was short.it had hands....legs...a robe.robe seemed like the right word...it was a gnome...That is what those little things where called. The Gnome wearing the robe was cheering about something..something else that was moving around.....a stereo tub..In the tub was the figure of....a boy...with snow white hair except for this red sliver of hair running across his forehead. The boy seemed to be fighting.... he seemed so strong..yet..he was holding back...Lilith couldn&#8217;t figure out why.....but she didn't ponder it too much. For some reason, she liked looking at him....it puzzled her why ..she felt so...different..she felt giddy and excited...
<br />

<br />
She her body and reached out searching for the boy. She wanted him she was so happy..so happy..happy happy happy PAIN!! FRIGHT!! LOSS!!!! ABANDONMENT!!!
<br />

<br />
*Release....... me.....*
<br />

<br />
Go away!!!
<br />

<br />
*Release ......me.......Release....... me...nooooow*
<br />

<br />
Who are you? Get out of my mind!!!!!
<br />

<br />
*Release.... me..Lilith!!......Release me...from prison....from Luclin...........*
<br />

<br />
Leave me alone!!!!!!!
<br />

<br />
*Release me!!!! *
<br />

<br />
I'll release you!!! Anything you want Just get of my mind!!!!! So scared...I cant see...I'm blind.....l-
<br />

<br />
*-ost.....alone.....you are me.. and I am you...Lilith....release me..from the false god's prison.....release me...*
<br />

<br />
How....
<br />

<br />
*keys....5......................Veeshan.....Cazic-Thule .....Tunare........ ...Errolisi..... .........Bristlebane. ..Release....... me......*
<br />

<br />
The other consciousness left Lilith...Leaving her numb from the invasion..aside from the lingering remnants of the others emotions.... Lilith retreated into herself, taking a few centuries to compose herself and prepare herself to release the other....and maybe find that boy. She giggled for the first time, she liked the boy. He would be hers. Finally ready she stretched and took full control of the body of meat and skin.
<br />

<br />
The computer beside the En-Gen Tech chirped loudly. It screeched, but the tech was slow as he was still interested in the fight between Nall and Magus. He had 40 platinum on Magus to win.
<br />

<br />
"ah Man..." He turned his chair to the noisy computer and stared at it wide eyed.
<br />

<br />
"What the? That can't be right!!! There is no way!!! How could the MTA levels have risen so high!! There's no way! and so quickly!!!! There was barely enough to register on the system a few minutes ago!! "
<br />

<br />
The tech went to slap an emergency call button to the Overseer, but he hard a cracking sound, he turned to the bio tube which held En-Gen's prize work Lilith. A large crack ran down the polymer tube.
<br />

<br />
"Oh no..Dear Quellious!" his eyes looked onto the sky blue eyes of Lilith, entranced...and it was the last he saw as shards of the bio tube sliced through him. 
<br />

<br />
Lilith ,dripping getting wet from the solution that once held her in stasis, smiled and stepped out into the new world.
<br />
------------------------------------
<br />

<br />
|10-1 odds Nall. Finish him off.|
<br />

<br />
Finally!!
<br />

<br />
As Magus fist swung in , Nall caught it and bent the man's hand back causing him to scream in pain, then swing with his free hand, which found itself swiftly in the same predicament as the other. With a light push, Magus sailed across the arena smashing into Crowd protection shield. Magus slumped down unconscious.
<br />

<br />
Nall flipped forward to the center of the ring then cheered "ALRIGHT!!! " The crowd roared...then went silent very quickly.
<br />

<br />
Hey..wht's up? Why is everyone so silent? I just won... This bites...
<br />

<br />
|Nall..they are silent because the odds against you winning just jumped 4 points|
<br />

<br />
Not that I don't mind the extra platinum..but that is kind of silly. I just won the match why would the odds j-
<br />

<br />
(Music Cue: Big Show| WWF: the Music Volume 5)
<br />

<br />
Nall turned around slowly to the entrance ramp, and stood dumbstruck as an armor clad giant almost 12 feet tall strode inside.
<br />

<br />
{Uh oh! Looks like things have just turned ugly. Weighing in at over a quarter ton, it's Magus's partner and the other half of the Demolition squad. TANK!!!
<br />

<br />
Tank roared shaking the arena, then lifted his arms and two rockets shot from his shoulders detonating in midair.
<br />

<br />
No..no...NO!!! This isn't fair!! This isn't a handicap match!!!!
<br />

<br />
"YOUR GOING TO GET IT RUNT!!" Tank shouted pointing at the dumbstruck Nall firing a rocket.
<br />

<br />
AAHHHH!!!!
<br />

<br />
Nall leap to the left just missing the rocket.
<br />

<br />
|Hey. Think of it as more money for fixing the airship|
<br />

<br />
That you broke!! You should be the one dodging missiles not me!!!
<br />

<br />
|I did not break the Naked Elf!! I was just in the wrong place at the wrong time!!! DUCK!!!!|
<br />

<br />
Two more rockets sailed over Nall's head.
<br />

<br />
That's it I have had enough of this!!!!
<br />

<br />
Nall glared intensely at Tank, then let out a yell. his muscles immediately swelled, ripping his shirt sleeves and pant legs. Exposing the large corded muscles. Several women in the audience wolf called at him.
<br />

<br />
As his muscles bulged to their fullest , he tensed ready to strike. "DRAGON-"
<br />

<br />
He disappeared from sight. Tank panned around looking for Nall and got more then he wanted. Nall reappeared in front of Tank in midair. Claws easily shredding through the 3 inch thick mythril armor. Rending large shards and shooting sparks everywhere, Nall sunk his fist into the mangled breastplate and ripped it off exposing the man inside the armor. Nall planted his feet into the man's chest then disappeared once again.
<br />

<br />
Reappearing behind the doubled over Tank, mana gathered in Nall's hands he forced it out upon Tank
<br />

<br />
"-GENOCIDE!!!" Tank found himself engulfed by a wave of pure energy, the wave was so forceful it lifted the super heavy man and sent him flying across the arena, landing not to far from his partner. 
<br />

<br />
{HOLY!!! WOW!! Have you ever seen anything like that? Lets count the hits in super slo-mo!!! 1...2...10.......Incredible, not counting that massive energy wave a breathtaking 56 hits all in 4 seconds!!! Unbelievable!!!!!!} 
<br />

<br />
Nall collapse on knee, panting heavily from the expenditure. But the cheers pf the crowd, got the adrenaline flowing and he got back up to his feet and waked tot he center of the ring and raised his arms in triumph!
<br />

<br />
YEAH!!! I RULE!!!!! AND THE 'NEKKID ELF' WILL FLY AGAIN!!!!
<br />

<br />
"ALRIG-" 
<br />

<br />
"I'M NOT THROIUGH WITH YOU YET!!!!"
<br />

<br />
"What the-" Nall whirled around to see the massive Tank back on his feet charging toward him
<br />

<br />
{NO WAY!!!}
<br />
|NO WAY!!!|
<br />
"NO WAY!!!"
<br />

<br />
But before Tank could get close a massive beam seemed to come out from no were and burn a large 5 foot hole between him and Nall.
<br />

<br />
"Who?"
<br />

<br />
{Who shot that particle beam?...Look up on the arena spire!!!! It's... It's!!}
<br />

<br />
|Aquapurine!!!|
<br />

<br />
-Marine.
<br />

<br />
|What ever.|
<br />

<br />
Standing tall arms folded, balanced on the high reaching spire of the floating arena was the SNG champion, Aquamarine. Her shoulder canon still smoking retracted back inside of the hardsuit.
<br />

<br />
"You!! It's bad enough that a puny little girl is the champion!@!! now you want to interfere in my match!!! I have had enough you girlie!!!" shouted Tank "FIRE ALL MISSLES!!"
<br />

<br />
Tank disappeared in a cloud of smoke as 13 missiles leapt out of various places of his armor suit and streaked toward Aquamarine.
<br />

<br />
{What is he doing? Why waste missiles, he can't Aquamarine she's above the Crowd Protection sh- OH MY GOD!!!! The missiles just went through the shield!!!! If they hit the spire who knows how many will be hurt or killed!!!!}
<br />

<br />
The panicked crowds screamed loudly, but it was not because of the thought of the missiles hitting tall spire , it was out of reaction of an ear piercing noise emanating from Aquamarine.
<br />

<br />
GAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!!!
<br />

<br />
|WHAT IN THE HELL IS THAT!!!!|
<br />

<br />
The missiles!!! Look the sound is causing them to detonate high and out of the way. Aquamarine saved the crowd!!!
<br />

<br />
As the ear piercing screeched died out, Aquamarine somersaulted through the air and landed in front of Tank. Planting a fist into his faceplate and then an armored leg into his groin dropping the behemoth.
<br />

<br />
Nall still somewhat dazed from the sound, watched through the haze as aquamarine then moonsaulted and dropped down the large hole she caused with her shoulder canon.
<br />

<br />
{Hey where is Aquamarine going? Wait a sec....Isn't that area of the floor above the ..OH NO!!!!!}
<br />

<br />
Aquamarine reappeared out of the hole carrying three very large jingling sacks. Turning toward the dazed Nall, she lifted her Visor showing her face to him. 
<br />

<br />
"Thanks for driving up the loot cutie. I owe ya!" She blew him a kiss and snapped down the visor. Crouching down for a moment, she leapt 50 feet into the air and then her thrusters kicked in sending her flying upward and away.
<br />

<br />
|NALL!!! You got to stop her!! She just robbed the place!!!! All our winnings is in those bags!!!|
<br />

<br />
No need to tell me twice!
<br />

<br />
Nall crouched down and leapt up into the air, but instead of thrusters, he spread his expansive wings and took after her.
<br />

<br />
"Come back here you...you!! Blue Platinum stealer you!!!!"
<br />

<br />
Flying under her, he swiped at her breastplate which she easily dodged. He swiped at her several times, missing again and again. seeing that she had no way of escaping without fighting him, she let go of the bags, and with a sudden quickness grasped Nall and head butted him. As stars circled around him, she cut her thrusters and began to fall back down toward the arena him tight in her grasp.
<br />

<br />
{Oh no!! Looks she has him set up for her signature move!! The Waterfall!!!}
<br />

<br />
Her thrusters kicked in as the plummeted head first, the arena grew larger and larger, and then she kicked of him letting him continue on his own.
<br />

<br />
{OH!!!! 1.....2.....3...AH...4..Geez!!...5...6!!! Man she just drove him down through 6 floors of the Arena. And that's reinforced Velium!! Some one get a cleric for this kid!}
<br />

<br />
Aquamarine continued back up into the sky, diverting just enough to catch the falling bags filled to the brim with platinum coins. A second pair of thrusters angled out and she rocketed up into the night sky.
<br />

<br />
...women............................ow.....
<br />

<br />
6 floors down under the arena, Nall's world went black.
<br />

<br />
|NALL!!!!! Answer me!!!!!!! NALL!|
<br />

<br />
The winged silver cat Reyas sifted through the mess of velium and mythril searching desperately for his grandson. After a few minutes, he came upon a patch of white fur. 
<br />

<br />
|Nall!!!!!|
<br />

<br />
Reaching in he pulled out a small white winged kitten with a red diamond on its forehead. Shaking the kitten for a few moment, it mewed grumpily.
<br />

<br />
Think it's to late to try the Antonican lottery? ow......
<br />

<br />
The kitten Nall, dozed off to sleep again.
<br />
-------------------------------------
<br />

<br />
Not too far away. On the top of one of mountain peaks in the Oasis of Marr. A figure wearing a two horned mask of crystal, watched what happened above. As the events unfolded and concluded. The figure began to talk to itself. at first it was a man's voice.
<br />

<br />
"Things are starting once again. The void is growing restless and stretching out more and more. The teachings have gotten it excited, it must not be allowed o be free...I should have listened to you."
<br />

<br />
The voice continued talking to itself but this time it was a woman's voice.
<br />

<br />
*You hold to much guilt. Why do you always take so much upon your shoulders?"*
<br />

<br />
Then back to the man's
<br />

<br />
"Because it is my fate not to rest until things are right. I owe her that much."
<br />

<br />
*But why do you place such a have penance upon yourself. You could have brought her back long ago. It was well within your grasp.*
<br />

<br />
"With the knowledge of what I have done to this world..and the pain I put on her I could not bear to look upon her. I would only see pain..nothing but endless pain."
<br />

<br />
*You are so melodramatic...but that is one thing I have always loved about you. It was why I picked you, because you don't find the easy way out..but even so. You don't have to take it this far. You can have some happiness.*
<br />

<br />
"Maybe...but not today. Only when the Void has been silenced."
<br />

<br />
*Yes.*
<br />

<br />
The two voices began to speak together, almost as one, but overlapping each other.
<br />

<br />
"The influence of the Void must wiped from Norrath and from al things. It must not be freed. It is our task, our duty to ensure that the Universe knows not the touch of the void. And it shall forever be our task, we are one in this, we are........ Rashan."

<br />
Subject: Maxim Tidias
<br />
Profession: Hell Lord of High City Palsa
<br />
Age: Estimated to be over 500 years old
<br />
MTA Level: Unchartable
<br />
Race: Erudite
<br />
Last Known Location: High City Palsa
<br />
En-Gen Filer: Shamus Actus
<br />

<br />
Bio: 
<br />

<br />
Maxim Tidias is the current Hell Lord for the High City Palsa. He acquired this rank, through less then perfect circumstances, which has lead to recent events and discovery of other potent subjects for integration into the Ghost Program and Lilith.
<br />

<br />

<br />
From what that can be extracted from old scrolls. Maxim was one of Raziel Eom&#8217;brn&#8217;s students at the Rank of Hell Knight. For all that can be told, it was said that Maxim was immensely powerful even then, but unlike his current state, he was easy going and for the most part cheerful and happy. But that was changed about 500 years ago, when the people of the now destroyed city of Erudin, attacked the also destroyed city of Paineel.
<br />

<br />
In the attack, his love was mortally wounded and later died in his arms as the old clich goes. Bringing out the cold, torturous Maxim that we know of now. The death of his love, also a Hell Knight Reva, sealed his heart in ice, and the only pleasure he ever received from then on was the slow torturing of those who opposed him, with his shadow chains.
<br />

<br />
Because of Raziel&#8217;s flight from Paineel, Maxim being the only surviving Hell Knight (being this after torturing and slaying the other student of Raziel.), Maxim was promoted to the rank of Hell Lord.
<br />

<br />
Unfortunately for him, custom and lore states that He is not a true Hell Lord and may never enter the sacred &#8216;Halls of Jahorn&#8217; (A mythical place, to the Hell Lords, where there souls go after death.), because he never defeated his mentor Raziel. This just further agitated Maxim, driving him even more insane then his mentor. (As unbelievable as that sounds).
<br />

<br />
Flash forward 500 years to the present. Maxim is still the Hell Lord, and at this point he has tortured and consumed the souls of hundreds and hundreds of his students and countless others. His heart of ice over the years has grown colder and his mind even more unstable until one day he meets a woman capable of piercing the ice, and for a time he almost seemed stable.
<br />

<br />
But things like this are never perfect, as it turns out the woman that eased his suffering, was the wife of one of our targets Dirk Lunas (See file Dirk). 
<br />

<br />
For reason unknown, she left him after the brief 2-month affair, returning to Dirk. This of course drove Maxim, insane beyond all point of recovery.
<br />

<br />
Interestingly enough, the woman later returned some time later and was promptly killed by Maxim. Though her death wasn&#8217;t his usual MO. It was quick and without (for the most part) pain.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Summary: Maxim is a valuable subject for the projects. A sample of him is required immediately. Though there are few subjects that I would like to delve into deeper, when I can spare the time. One, through out his reign as Hell Lord or even back when he was just a Knight. No one ever saw his familiar. It can only be speculated that, he chooses to hide it for when he needs the familiar's power..which makes you wonder just how powerful can Maxim be?

Subject: Dirk Lunas
<br />
Profession: Unknown
<br />
Age: Estimated to be over 500 years old
<br />
MTA Level: Unchartable
<br />
Race: Combinate Creature (High Elf and Unknown)
<br />
Last Known Location: ButcherBlock protected zone, Continent Faydwer 
<br />
En-Gen Filer: Shamus Actus
<br />

<br />
Bio: 
<br />

<br />
Dirk Lunas, probably one of the most reclusive and hard to find subjects ever tracked. There is not much to report specifically about him; from old records it is known that he is a master of Shadow Magic, supposedly a &#8216;God&#8217; level magic form.
<br />

<br />
On the other hand there is a great wealth of information about the people around him. More specifically his wife. He lived with her for a great period of time inside the Butcherblock protected area. For the most part that is were they stayed, only occasionally visiting the outside world.
<br />

<br />
In one of these outings his wife met and had an affair with Maxim Tidias (See file Maxim). The affair was brief however, and she retuned to Dirk. But this brings up an interesting possibility. About 2 years after the affair and her return she gave birth to a child, because of the wildly varying gestation periods (5 months-3 years) of elves and half-breed elves. It is unknown if the child was fathered by Maxim or Dirk. But regardless of the child&#8217;s father, she must contain extraordinaire power. Which is why En-Gen is very interested in her, not to mention the Dread king who dominates the accused continent.
<br />

<br />
Summary: Dirk Lunas and his(if she is his) child are valuable subjects and a sample must be obtained. Also considering the constant attacks by the Dread King and his knowledge of Shadow Magic, I recommend that we take a sample of Dirk and liquidate him, but extract the child from Faydwer and bring her back to En-Gen. Not only can we obtain samples from her, but also considering her young age and impressionability, she could be recruited to one of our programs.

 The Shadow Falls: Sign of the Void
<br />

<br />
Chapter Two: Atwight...the lonely blade.
<br />

<br />
The night was quiet save the storm brewing. Dirk sat in the chair, no light on, pistol in hand and armored in his heavy power suit, save his head, on which the helmet&#8216;s visor was open.
<br />

<br />
His skin had returned to it&#8217;s normal gray color as the anger subsided. He was actually a fairly handsome man. He was built like a sword blade, long and thin, deceptively slight. He was actually very strong when he needed to be. His dark hair and cool black-and-blue eyes had given him his title. Black Elf, they called him. Black in body, maybe, but not in heart. Darkness was his weapon, and so was light. But it didn&#8217;t control him.
<br />

<br />
 He slouched, actually, drained of most energy. He hadn&#8217;t eaten a full, good meal in days-he&#8217;d given all of his better food to Trini. A smile, melancholy and bleak, rose to his face as he remembered how much his daughter looked like her mother.
<br />

<br />
Memories rose unbidden. He gritted his teeth, but he couldn&#8217;t stop them.
<br />

<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />

<br />
Nall ordered another drink. The waitress looked oddly at him. &#8220;Aren&#8217;t you a little young for the hard stuff?&#8221;
<br />

<br />
&#8220;Just get me it. I need it.&#8221; Nall sighed and turned to his grandfather. &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe that I let her get away.&#8221;
<br />

<br />
&#8220;Let?&#8221; Reyas grinned in half-elven form. &#8220;You got yourself stomped.&#8221; He gave the waitress a lewd grin, she blushed and looked away.
<br />

<br />
&#8220;And we bet all our cash on that fight...and that....that....&#8221; Nall looked furious. &#8220;jerk stole it! We&#8216;ll never pay our debts! We&#8216;ll never fly that damn...airship again! We gotta find a job..&#8221;
<br />

<br />
&#8220;Calm down, Nall. Calm down.&#8221; Reyas sighed. &#8220;You have to be patient. We&#8216;ll fix the airship soon enough.&#8221;
<br />

<br />
&#8220;Easy for you to say! How old are you anyways?&#8221;
<br />

<br />
&#8220;I am not old!&#8221;
<br />

<br />
&#8220;So several millennia is young?&#8221;
<br />

<br />
&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t know! It&#8217;s not the age, it&#8217;s the attitude-&#8221;
<br />

<br />
&#8220;Boys, boys...&#8221; A man in a black business suit was standing nearby. &#8220;Please behave yourself.&#8221; He looked slightly suspiciously at them, then leaned forward conspiratorially. &#8220;I was listening. You need a job? I have a business proposition for you..&#8221;
<br />

<br />
&#8220;We don&#8217;t work for free, you know. Show us some encouragement.&#8221; Nall said, the drink beginning to get to him.
<br />

<br />
The man opened his briefcase.
<br />

<br />
Nall saw nothing but the shine of the pure platinum bullion inside. One hundred percent pure, shining, glittering platinum bars. He found he had stopped breathing. Drink forgotten, his eyes fixed on the man&#8217;s face as enchanted by the platinum his wits wandered.
<br />

<br />
&#8220;That pique your interest?&#8221;
<br />

<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />

<br />
Dirk and his wife had lived in the temple since Tunare&#8217;s death. He had loved her very much, of course. But while he had been content to study, read, and learn most of the time, with only infrequent trips, Jesi didn&#8217;t have the patience for that. He had let her go out into the world on her own. She had left once-and not come back or even communicated for two months. He had only learned what had happened from her.
<br />

<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />

<br />
Maxim stared at the dead body in front of him. It was a woman, dressed in evening dress and lying prone. It was old, five years old, but showed no sign of decay. Indeed, the wood elf could have been asleep.
<br />

<br />
&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry....&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;I&#8217;m so sorry, Jesica.&#8221;
<br />

<br />
[I hate you! I hate you!] she shrieked in his head. [I hate you! You hurt me....Let me go!]
<br />

<br />
&#8220;No. I can&#8217;t. You&#8217;ll die. I can&#8216;t stand to let that happen.&#8221;
<br />

<br />
[You killed me already!]
<br />

<br />
&#8220;I.....&#8221; Guilt wracked Maxim. &#8220;You&#8217;re...special to me. I don&#8217;t know why...&#8221;
<br />

<br />
[Some sign of showing love by KILLING ME.]
<br />

<br />
&#8220;Don&#8217;t.....! I...&#8221;
<br />

<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />

<br />
She had encountered Maxim. He had befriended her, loved her-and finally, had an affair with her. She had been torn, but finally left him. They had never found out who was Trini&#8217;s father-she had been born shortly afterward.
<br />

<br />
It had been strange to Dirk. His wife had never showed any signs of boredom or lack of devotion. Her affair was almost entirely unlike her. But he had gone on with life, and everything seemed bliss. Then his world came crashing down.
<br />

<br />
It had been five years ago. He remembered it well-too well. The public record of his wife&#8217;s death was only partially true-he had watched it happen.
<br />

<br />
They had gone to Palsa for their anniversary. It had been a wonderful trip, everything he could have hoped for.  They had rented a hotel room, seen shows, eaten at fancy restaurants. He remembered her laughter, her joy-and got nothing but pain from the memory.
<br />

<br />
They had been walking home after a night of carousing. Walking on the street. He had gotten a feeling of danger, but he had been a little drunk and didn&#8217;t pay enough attention.
<br />

<br />
Then Maxim had appeared, eyes bright with envious rage. As they had tried to grab their weapons and fight, he had sent a barbed, spiny chain from his flaming cloak straight at him. Jesica had leapt in front of it. It had impacted her in the heart. Her scream blotted out all else, her hot blood had fountained out all over him. He could still feel it and it made his skin crawl and turned the taste of all good things to ashes in his mouth.
<br />

<br />
He had screamed so loud it made his throat muscles raw. He remembered catching her, then turning a murderous eye on Maxim and advancing with enough rage boiling his blood to obliterate the universe and everyone in it. But the Hell Lord had surprised him. His eyes had widened, then he had sent Dirk, spinning, to the pavement with a hard blow, then picked up Jesica&#8217;s dying body and vanished. Dirk knew her soul belonged to Maxim now, and the thought burned his mind like the flames that had marred his body previously. He had never even got a chance to say good-bye to his beloved. Hatred had nearly claimed his sanity.
<br />

<br />
Trini was all that was left to him, the only anchor of sanity in a void of despair. But an idea had began to take shape recently. A hopeful, terrible idea.
<br />

<br />
Dirk had his wife&#8217;s genetic code stored in his armor&#8217;s computer and in several backup chips. If he could just free her soul from Maxim, he wouldn&#8217;t need her body-which couldn&#8216;t live again, as it&#8216;s heart had been shattered. He could hire someone to make hers again, and infuse it with her spirit. And then they would be together again. Since he was dreaming, Dirk expanded on it, adding all his desires. They could buy a home in a city or out on the countryside somewhere. Trini would never be lonely again; they&#8216;d send her to a school and when she came home they would be normal parents and help her with her work (Not like that was needed, Trini had a miniaturized computer chip implanted in her brain with a massive database anyways.). He could do everything he had ever wanted to do but couldn&#8217;t due to lack of resources. He could maybe even find Yakov and Xedri&#8217;s descendants, and maybe even the two themselves, if they were still alive. Everything would be perfect........he would be happy again....Trini would be happy. They would never have to worry about the menace of the Dread King. He would never be lonely again.
<br />

<br />
Dirk had quickly lost himself in his fantasy. He shook his head. Stop dreaming.
<br />

<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />

<br />
Reyas wasn&#8217;t breathing either. He said in tones of utmost respect, &#8220;Sir, I think you just hired us. What do you need?&#8221;
<br />

<br />
The man smiled. &#8220;That&#8217;s more like it. There is...an artifact I need recovered from the Selvatorian wastes.&#8221;
<br />

<br />
&#8220;What sort?&#8221; Nall asked, face leaned forward and eyes intent. &#8220;What shape, size, weight, characteristics? Also, what&#8217;s the pay?&#8221;
<br />

<br />
&#8220;Twelve million platinum in bullion, or as much as you can get these for. Believe me, you&#8217;ll be happy with it. The artifact in question is a sword, hidden in a small catacombs system in the wastes.&#8221; The man leaned forward conspiratorially again. &#8220;This sword isn&#8217;t guarded much or in any way difficult to get to for someone of your capabilities.&#8221;
<br />

<br />
Nall wasn&#8217;t even paying attention. Twelve million platinum in BULLION? They could sell that for twice that much! They wouldn&#8217;t have to simply fix the airship, they&#8217;d upgrade it! The height of luxury...
<br />

<br />
The man&#8217;s nagging voice snapped Nall back to reality. He grinned impishly. &#8220;You got it. Arrange transport for us and we&#8217;ll get your stuff.&#8221;
<br />

<br />
&#8220;Oh, I almost forgot.&#8221; The man smiled, a predator&#8217;s smile. &#8220;The sword is dangerous. Watch yourselves.&#8221;
<br />

<br />
Reyas looked huffed. &#8220;Sure. A sword, dangerous to us? You insulting us?&#8221;
<br />

<br />
&#8220;Considering the boy&#8217;s performance in the arena, perhaps I should just go hire Aquamarine. After all.....&#8221;
<br />

<br />
Nall&#8217;s blood boiled. &#8220;Now you hold on a minute-&#8221; He prodded the man in the chest, razor-sharp claws coming within an inch of torso as they emerged from their hidden sheaths. &#8220;We are just fine, thank you. You tell us about this job, and we&#8217;ll damn well do it.&#8221;
<br />

<br />
&#8220;So we have a deal?&#8221;
<br />

<br />
&#8220;You betcha.&#8221; Nall smiled and shook hands with him, not trusting the shifty-looking eyes.
<br />

<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />

<br />
The man pulled out a cell phone as Nall and Reyas left. &#8220;Contact. I&#8217;ve arranged for them to pick up the item.&#8221;
<br />

<br />
&#8220;Good. Proceed and send a team of Ghosts to extract it and them-at gunpoint. The Director would rather not pay up.&#8221;
<br />

<br />
&#8220;How about Team Five? They&#8216;re full strength and equipped.&#8221;
<br />

<br />
&#8220;Five is already in Faydwer hunting Lunas and the girl. You&#8217;ll have to work with Six.&#8221;
<br />

<br />
&#8220;Why again? Six? They don&#8217;t even have full strength. And no support.&#8221;
<br />

<br />
&#8220;They&#8217;ll have to do. The Director has reason to believe that this will be more successful.&#8221;
<br />

<br />
&#8220;All right. Six will trail them. Five should rendezvous with Six after recovery. All subjects must be collected as soon as possible. I&#8216;ve placed a transmitter on the target.&#8221;
<br />

<br />
&#8220;What if they manage to evade the team? Or kill them?&#8221;
<br />

<br />
&#8220;Evade Ghosts? Come on. Be serious. As for killing them, I wouldn&#8216;t bet on it either. The teams should be able to defeat them without much trouble. Remember their genetic sources.&#8221;
<br />

<br />
Satisfied by his success, the agent of En-Gen lay back and sipped his drink. The key to owning someone was angering them, he decided. Once that had happened, you could make them do anything. The phones rang again.
<br />

<br />
&#8220;What?&#8221;
<br />

<br />
&#8220;Lillith is gone. We suspect breakout.&#8221;
<br />

<br />
&#8220;Damn!&#8221; The agent cursed wildly. &#8220;Wait. She has a transmitter implanted, correct?&#8221;
<br />

<br />
&#8220;Correct.&#8221;
<br />

<br />
&#8220;Well, track it. Keep her away from the targets at all costs.&#8221;
<br />

<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />

<br />
Dirk was brought out of dreams of the future by the sound of a footstep. He slowly, ever so carefully, withdrew the switchblade knife from his belt and flicked it open with a twist of the wrist. It had been an anniversary present long ago. Jesi had always been practical, it reminded him of her again, and it hurt to use it.
<br />

<br />
Again. The sound of booted feet. He slowly brought the knife into throwing position and with a mental command sealed the helmet.
<br />

<br />
(I&#8217;m up and ready. What&#8216;s on the menu?)
<br />

<br />
Can it, Starlight. I need infrared.
<br />

<br />
His vision turned greenish. Ahead, masked by shadows, a humanoid, living, male shape glowed bright green. It was carrying a rifle of some sort, probably automatic, pointed straight ahead. Seeing no friendly identity codes, and guessing from the man&#8216;s manner-and his natural instincts, Dirk threw the knife.
<br />

<br />
A sudden flash of green signified the heat bursting from the wound as the knife impacted at the man&#8216;s gut. The man cried out-and then started to rise again. Incredible. The knife was tungsten, and would go through most armor like paper. But Dirk had had enough. He brought the pistol up and caressed the trigger. A hail of death lanced out again and again and again. After four shots, the man crumpled without a sound.
<br />

<br />
(Nice armor.)
<br />

<br />
I noticed. 
<br />

<br />
He leapt out of his seat and knelt down to the corpse. Checking for other enemies, and seeing no signs of life, he moved closer.
<br />

<br />
Lights please.
<br />

<br />
(Activated, oh mighty military genius.)
<br />

<br />
Can you stuff it?
<br />

<br />
He looked down and saw a familiar insignia. Reading it, he got up, and turned to walk away.
<br />

<br />
&#8220;En-Gen. But they don&#8216;t have troopers this tough....do they? What&#8216;s this? &#8216;Ghost&#8216;?&#8221;
<br />

<br />
A bullet whistled by his visor. Another shot out straight at him and bounced off his armor&#8217;s shields. As the neural chip on his forehead-the only one, so he could wear armor beneath as well- transmitted mental commands, the nozzle on his armor&#8217;s right forearm erupted in black energy as a black diamond once part of his original sword received a beam of energy and whirled around. Dirk pivoted, letting the prism blade sweep through the shadows. The supposedly dead man cried out again and fell to the ground, a bisected husk.
<br />

<br />
Dirk began to run. Fear for his daughter filled him and he sprinted for Trini&#8217;s room.
<br />

<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />

<br />
So do you trust this guy?
<br />

<br />
[Of course not. Anyone offering that much can&#8216;t be on the up and up.]
<br />

<br />
Wow, Grandpa. Your wits haven&#8217;t slipped after all. Amazing.
<br />

<br />
[Remember what I told you about respect?]
<br />

<br />
Respect is earned. And not by womanizing alone.
<br />

<br />
[No way! You don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re talking about, kid!]
<br />

<br />
Nall stared out the window at the frozen wastes of Selvatoria. The country ruled the upper north of the continent, and was rich in minerals but not in food and water  . The rapid euphoria of seeing so much money in one place was beginning to fade. He didn&#8217;t trust the crew, so he spoke telepathically.
<br />

<br />
Reyas punched Nall. &#8220;Ow!&#8221; 
<br />

<br />
[So what are you planning to do with the sword?]
<br />

<br />
Sell it, of course. If he&#8217;s willing to pay twelve million in platinum bullion, then there are others who will pay more. We&#8217;ll be rich! Wealthy for the rest of our lives!
<br />

<br />
[Isn&#8217;t that a little amoral?]
<br />

<br />
You were the one who broke our ship. So keep quiet with the moralizing.
<br />

<br />
[I DID NOT BREAK IT! I was only walking on it and-]
<br />

<br />
Excuses, excuses. Nall turned and looked at his grandfather, then spoke aloud. &#8220;Looks like we&#8217;re there.&#8221;
<br />

<br />
The pilot spoke over then intercom. &#8220;Ok, boys, this is the general area. Signal us when you&#8217;re ready to go back. We&#8216;ll be watching for the flares.&#8221;
<br />

<br />
Nall picked up his weapons and left the compartment. He heard his grandfather follow. Seconds later, the massive Dropship lifted into the night sky.
<br />

<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />

<br />
Dirk ran like a bat out of hell, tearing through ruined corridors and only pausing to catch his breath. 
<br />

<br />
(Stop, hold it!)
<br />

<br />
WHAT?
<br />

<br />
(Stealth. Five enemies ahead. MT is really high, and they&#8217;re armed and dangerous.)
<br />

<br />
Thanks.
<br />

<br />
(You&#8217;re too much like your dad for comfort.)
<br />

<br />
Dirk crept to the area around the doorway. As he raised his armor&#8217;s right arm, he aimed, directly for a head that seemed to leap out. Five men and women in hard suits were searching the room.
<br />

<br />
Dirk fired the automatic weapon in his right arm, turning the silence into a violent cacophony of sound. It took one man in the head. Screaming, the man hit the ground. The other four turned as one and flame licked the alcove.
<br />

<br />
Dirk pointed and screamed &#8220;Nocturne Beam!&#8221; A black beam, aided by the night already in the chamber, tore into a woman, who shrieked and grasped her chest. He whirled-and took a bullet to the side. His armor withstood the blow, but barely. He locked eyes with the man he had thought down.
<br />

<br />
No way......these guys are too tough.
<br />

<br />
Spent cartridges flying from the chamber, Dirk stabbed his arm&#8217;s machine gun out at the wounded man. There were blue ripples where the bullets impacted, but no damage, indicative of a mana shield amplifying the armor&#8217;s shield. 
<br />

<br />
Dirk could play with those too. He activated his. As bullets bounced off his shield, he ignited his prism blade and slashed, killing his enemy without a sound. He whirled-and took a black beam in the shoulder. It sent tendrils of pain through his left side.
<br />

<br />
NO WAY. That&#8217;s biologically impossible...isn&#8217;t it?
<br />

<br />
(They don&#8217;t seem to think so.)
<br />

<br />
Dirk sprayed the room with bullets and rushed in, killing two before they could even draw their melee weapons by the most ensured way he could-beheading. The wounded woman and a young man drew reinforced adamantine weapons, the ultra-hard, ultra-light black metal shining, the man using a sword and supporting his wounded comrade, who was using a pair of katar.. Dirk rushed them with blade held high.
<br />

<br />
Prism blades operated through generating an energy field and focusing it through a prism. They were superior to laser blades because the minute fluctuations in the rotating prism caused the blade to constantly shift and be very difficult to guard against. However, adamantine lessened the damage by reflecting the light off in random directions. So the boy managed to parry-the girl wasn&#8217;t in any shape to fight. Dirk snarled and struck again, and again, and again, striking either blade, shield, or armor but doing no critical damage, before the boy thought he could risk a counterattack.
<br />

<br />
The kid&#8217;s attack was beautifully well struck-but futile. Dirk smiled behind his visor and countered with a ten-strike-in-quick-succession combo without losing a beat. Though armor shards flew, amazingly the boy was still standing.
<br />

<br />
Dirk&#8217;s face twisted into a bitter smile. He raised his right arm. &#8220;Night Blade.&#8221; A cone of darkness erupted from the floor and drilled into his opponents. The already wounded woman screamed and fell to the floor, her shield shorting out and her mind in agony from neural feedback. The kid yelled in pain but stood his ground, raising his own arm.
<br />

<br />
&#8220;Plasma Flare.&#8221;
<br />

<br />
Dirk yelled in pain inside his armor as flame blasted at him. His cooling system tried to keep up, and barely managed to do so.  He regarded his enemy coldly through the visor, breathing low and steady. The boy  was panting hard-but shut up abruptly as Dirk rushed in and backhanded the boy across the head, knocking him out.
<br />

<br />
Then another scream. &#8220;PA-PA!!!!&#8221;
<br />

<br />
Dirk&#8217;s blood turned to ice, his skin jet-black, and he ran for Trini&#8217;s room.
<br />

<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />

<br />
Nall looked around cautiously. &#8220;Unguarded my a--.&#8221; he said, and looked up again
<br />

<br />
Five men in the uniforms of Selvatorian troops stood guard over a strange-looking ruin in the barren, frozen wastes.
<br />

<br />
&#8220;Five. No trouble.&#8221; Reyas answered.
<br />

<br />
&#8220;That&#8217;s not the point. If he lied to us, we could be set up.&#8221; Nall cautiously aimed his rifle. &#8220;Here goes. Mana Wave!&#8221;
<br />

<br />
A wave of azure energy crossed the area between them and tore into a trooper, spinning him around and dropping him to the snow. as he rose again, a bullet from Nall&#8217;s railgun rifle broke the sound barrier and smashed into the enemy with all the grace and gentleness of a sledgehammer. The man dropped to the ground, his helmet a ruin of steel and plastic, and did not rise again.
<br />

<br />
The remaining four fired as one, the roar of their weapons shattering all semblance of peace. The bullets were fired at Reyas.
<br />

<br />
&#8220;Grandpa!&#8221;
<br />

<br />
Reyas pulled a blade of mana from nowhere and concentrated.  Nall heard a series of crackling noises and another Selvatorian fell dead as Reyas deflected the bullets with his blade. Nall whistled.
<br />

<br />
The remaining three did the only thing available to them. They charged, two of them tossing fireballs as they went.
<br />

<br />
Nall felt his skin and armor burn from the heat, but still managed to keep his aim. A round of shots and his attacker fell dead. Then they were within minimum range. Nall leapt to one side and clawed at another one. The claws went through the light steel breastplate easily and pierced the man beneath. As internal organs shredded, the man fell dead with a strangled scream.
<br />

<br />
The last man launched himself into a berserker-like charge, running straight past Nall and swiping at Reyas with the bayonet on his rifle. The two traded blows for a bit before Reyas ran his broadsword right through the middle of his assailant. The last man collapsed like a doll without strings.
<br />

<br />
&#8220;Nice work Grandpa. Guess you&#8217;re good for something besides womanizing after all.&#8221;
<br />

<br />
&#8220;Thanks-and I can still kick your butt, young whippersnapper.&#8221; Reyas pointed. &#8220;After you.&#8221;
<br />

<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />

<br />
Dirk ran into the room where Trini slept. He stopped immediately.
<br />

<br />
&#8220;Don&#8217;t move, Lunas.&#8221; A group of three, heavily armor-clad &#8216;Ghosts&#8217; were aiming various nasty weapons at him. One held Trini.
<br />

<br />
&#8220;Daddy! Let me go!&#8221; She screamed and kicked at her assailant.
<br />

<br />
&#8220;You heard her. Let her go,&#8221; Dirk said, his voice at a dangerously quiet level.
<br />

<br />
&#8220;And if I don&#8217;t?&#8221; the leader asked with a smirk as he raised his visor. His face was menacing, tough, hard. Brown skin, dark hair. A pair of deep-set green eyes.
<br />

<br />
&#8220;You&#8217;ll contract a bad case of &#8216;dead&#8217;. That bad enough?&#8221;
<br />

<br />
&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to back that up, you know. Surrender now and I promise you neither her or you shall be harmed.&#8221;
<br />

<br />
&#8220;I know what En-Gen wants me for. No thanks.&#8221; Dirk brought his weapons up.
<br />

<br />
&#8220;Your loss. Sergeant, Private, take the kid and go.&#8221; The leader spread his arms and brought his armor&#8217;s rocket launcher up over his shoulder. Dirk aimed his gun at the two, but one of them held up Trini as a human shield and prodded her with his pistol.
<br />

<br />
&#8220;Daddy!&#8221; she screamed.
<br />

<br />
&#8220;I can&#8217;t....Trini!&#8221;
<br />

<br />
Damnit! Dirk let the weapon down and the two vanished out the doorway to the balcony. He heard the rush of their jump jets.
<br />

<br />
The next thing he heard was the dreaded tone and screaming of &#8220;MISSILE LOCK!&#8221; He leapt to the right as the enemy man fired, fire jetting out the back of the launcher. The missile lanced to the side and literally blew the roof off. Dirk leapt forward and brought his prism blade to life, slashing down.
<br />

<br />
It impacted another prism blade, a bright orange one which stained the room with argent light. As energy blade struck energy blade, his own flashed white and sucked the light from the room. Dirk felt the impact of a dozen bullets as a machine gun licked his armor. His screen recorded 5% armor reduction.
<br />

<br />
Dirk yelled and his body was coated in supernatural fire so hot that it literally sucked in everything, including light particles, black as night. He flipped backwards, bringing an armored boot into his assailant&#8217;s gut. The man gave no ground, but countered with a brilliant streak of argent flame. Dirk ignited his jumpjets and leapt into the sky as his foe did likewise.
<br />

<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />

<br />
Nall placed his boot ever so cautiously on the stone beneath him. Nothing happened, so he relaxed and placed the other one on it.
<br />

<br />
Immediately alarms started to blare. Nall cursed wildly and Reyas looked around as troops clad in riot armor and carrying bullet shields stepped out. There was the ****ing of twenty automatic rifles.
<br />

<br />
&#8220;Drop your weapons and stand down.&#8221; The leader spoke through his filtered gas mask. The metallic tone of the voice was odd.
<br />

<br />
In response Nall simply grinned and struck the ground beneath him. &#8220;Catastrophe!&#8221; he cried. The ground exploded in fire and many of the troops were knocked onto their backs. Nall pulled out his railgun and started firing wildly as return fire blasted over his head. He ducked behind a pillar and reloaded. There was no sign of Reyas.
<br />

<br />
&#8220;Grandpa?&#8221; he yelled as he swung around and drilled a man with a murderous volley.
<br />

<br />
&#8220;I&#8217;m fine!&#8221; Reyas pulled out his mana broadsword and struck three quick blows across one man&#8217;s torso. The man responded by bludgeoning Reyas in the gut, but the dragon wasn&#8217;t affected at all. He raised one hand and energy was collected into a sphere in his palm. Reyas clenched his fist and screamed &#8220;Graviton Beam!&#8221;
<br />

<br />
The energy exploded outward in a lance of death. Reyas pivoted, slashing through support pillars and men, til the beam exhausted itself. The crushed remains of Reyas&#8217;s opponent collapsed in a heap of blackened, melted metal and melted plastics.
<br />

<br />
&#8220;Nall!&#8221; Reyas yelled. &#8216;They&#8217;re machines! They&#8217;re not human!&#8221;
<br />

<br />
&#8220;Geez, thanks for letting me know.&#8221; Nall slammed another clip into his rifle. &#8220;I&#8217;m running outta bullets here!&#8221; He fired again, creasing another assailant&#8217;s body with thousands of  pits and holes. The thing stopped moving after a full round. Not able to take the time to reload, Nall dropped the railgun and leapt at his enemies, claws ripping apart steel torsos and bodies with merciless efficiency.
<br />

<br />
Reyas spun and drove his blade into the floor. Tremors shuddered through the building and the last remnants of the enemy force collapsed.
<br />

<br />
&#8220;You could have done that earlier.&#8221;
<br />

<br />
&#8220;You were doing all right. Is the young, spry, fit man tired?&#8221; Reyas laughed.
<br />

<br />
&#8220;Quit goofing around, grandpa.&#8221; Nall pulled a fresh packet of clips from his backpack. &#8220;Let&#8217;s go.&#8221;
<br />

<br />
The next room was a simple, well-furnished office. There was no surveillance and no traps. On the desk was a gold-plated case.
<br />

<br />
&#8220;This seems to have been a covert Selvatorian base, grandpa. I don&#8217;t like this-but as long as there are no witnesses, we&#8217;ll get away with it. Selvatoria always bugged me anyways.&#8221;
<br />

<br />
&#8220;Careful, Nall.&#8221;
<br />

<br />
Nall opened the case. A long, ornate platinum-and-silver long sword lay inside, the blade festooned with lots and lots of small gemstones. He picked it up. It seemed to radiate power, and he grinned.
<br />

<br />
Then a voice spoke right inside his head.
<br />

<br />
/I don&#8217;t recognize you. Who are you?\
<br />

<br />
&#8220;Ahh!&#8221;
<br />

<br />
The door slammed open and he heard a familiar voice.
<br />

<br />
&#8220;Drop the sword, cutie.&#8221; He spun around and looked down the barrel of Aquamarine&#8217;s particle cannon.
<br />

<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />

<br />
Dirk spun around in midair and boosted the power to his jumpjets. He drove the blade at his foe with hatred surging in his blood. It was parried, then the enemy man snapped his fingers and cried out &#8220;Flare.&#8221;
<br />

<br />
Dirk&#8217;s armor was suddenly engulfed in bright red flames of which the concussion nearly snuffed his own black flame barrier. He cursed and raised his arm. &#8220;Lucent Beam.&#8221; A bright blade of light crossed the air between them and lanced deep into armor.
<br />

<br />
Back and forth the duel raged. Dirk had found a worthy opponent, and though the scream of weapons and magic was thick in the air, neither could penetrate the other&#8217;s defenses. They ripped through the air, and Dirk locked weapons with his adversary and grinned as his other hand glowed with black fire.
<br />

<br />
(Watch your six!)
<br />

<br />
Then he knew the horror of freefall as...something blasted him in each side and he fell.
<br />

<br />
It was five hundred feet to the ground. He impacted with a hideous crunch of shattering metal and equipment, felt a shard of torn armor dig into his back-and screamed. He stared through his suddenly cracked visor and saw a reddish stain on and near the crack. He looked to his side and saw his jumpjets were shot. He looked up to see two enemies about him and cursed in one of the lower languages of Hell.
<br />

<br />
&#8220;Nice timing, Rashan.&#8221; Dirk&#8217;s original foe commented. &#8220;It was starting to get a little iffy.&#8221;
<br />

<br />
&#8220;Next time, do not depend on our arrival.&#8221; said the figure with a two-horned mask, in a male and female voice. Dirk shuddered and started to rise.
<br />

<br />
&#8220;I&#8217;m not finished yet!&#8221; he yelled. The figure laughed and sent a glowing orb of energy at him. Dirk whipped out the modified prism blade and parried the ball, sending it back. &#8220;I&#8217;d rather not keep your little gift!&#8221;
<br />

<br />
The figure caught the orb in a gauntleted hand and smashed it, then laughed. &#8220;....Small wonder. You&#8217;re too weak to be worth anything.&#8221; it said in it&#8217;s female voice.
<br />

<br />
Dirk&#8217;s eyes and skin turned black as he gave in to his darker side. He raised his arm and screamed &#8220;Mar&#8217;ak, nealk veelth!&#8221; and ran at the figure, hatred surging in his veins and all moral values dead. His strike was barely parried, then something hit him and he slammed into the rock. He heard metal tear and then started to black out.
<br />

<br />
&#8220;What will we do with him?&#8221; he heard weakly.
<br />

<br />
&#8220;Leave him.&#8221;
<br />

<br />
&#8220;But my orders were to kill him after extracting a sample-&#8221;
<br />

<br />
&#8220;We said leave him. If you want to kill him, go ahead and try.&#8221;
<br />

<br />
The man descended to the earth and got close to Dirk. Through reddened eyes, Dirk saw the hazy form of the man get closer.
<br />

<br />
&#8220;It&#8217;s over for you...&#8221; and the man aimed.
<br />

<br />
Then he screamed in pain as Dirk&#8217;s left hand went straight through armor as if it were a shadow and clenched in the area of his heart. The blood left the man&#8217;s face. He writhed and struck weak blows on Dirk&#8217;s helmet, which did absolutely no good.
<br />

<br />
&#8220;I...don&#8217;t think...so.&#8221; Dirk gasped. &#8220;Never...underestimate...a demon...even a half-breed.&#8221; With no regrets, Dirk clenched his fist and felt something-something rather important- tear. Then he let go. &#8220;If you hurry....you might live....&#8221;
<br />

<br />
Already screaming and breathing hard, the man rocketed into the sky. Dirk stopped fighting the darkness, and fell unconscious.
<br />

<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />

<br />
Nall backed away. &#8220;Oh no, it&#8217;s AquaPurine!&#8221; he taunted.
<br />

<br />
&#8220;MARINE! AQUAMARINE!!!&#8221; she screamed, and fired the particle cannon. It missed Nall narrowly and blasted into a wall. He winced and backed up another foot. Recovering her composure, she re-aimed it and repeated her order. &#8220;Drop the sword.&#8221;
<br />

<br />
&#8220;You think I&#8217;m crazy? You ripped me off before, you&#8217;re not doing it again.&#8221; Nall aimed and fired as she raised her own weapon.
<br />

<br />
The sound of both warriors opening the gates of Hell to one another was tremendous. Nall saw only a hazy, bluish glow as the particle cannon bestowed it&#8217;s teasing, crushing caress on his body. He felt pain. Only pain. He dimly heard Aquamarine&#8217;s screams, of fury, not of pain, then he saw again and she wasn&#8217;t in front. 
<br />

<br />
No WAY do you get behind me! He spun like a top and grabbed the sword from the table. With a curse he swung for her shoulder, knocking the particle cannon to the ground. As she cursed wildly and struck with her fist, he continued his spin, deflecting most of the blow. It still closed his jaw abruptly and made his teeth ache. She fired something at him and he felt himself be propelled by the impact. He slammed into a wall with a crunch.
<br />

<br />
....Where the hell are you, Grandpa?
<br />

<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />

<br />
When he came to, he may have been screaming. He didn&#8217;t know. He couldn&#8217;t see out of one eye. Did I lose it? he wondered.
<br />

<br />
[There&#8217;s blood covering it.]
<br />

<br />
His hand couldn&#8217;t reach inside the helmet. He did the best he could and sent a subliminal command to his computer to blow some air inside his helm. The blood slowly was washed away by the jets of air-most of it, He stared at the bloody crack in his visor with a numbed brain and felt the clotting blood on his cheek.
<br />

<br />
[You ok? You&#8216;ve cut your cheek to the bone, Dirk. It isn&#8216;t serious but you&#8216;re in shock.]
<br />

<br />
I think so........He tried to get up and felt the fire of the barely staunched wound on his back. Then again....
<br />

<br />
[The emergency medical supplies are exhausted. You&#8217;re gonna have to make do. Are you still any good at healing?]
<br />

<br />
&#8220;Yeah...&#8220; he whispered and felt the cool blue light infusing his wounds.
<br />

<br />
[You took one hell of a beating, Dirk. I&#8217;ve never seen that happen before.]
<br />

<br />
&#8220;I suppose that guy was really, really good.&#8221; he said aloud. The screaming fire of his wounds was only barely cushioned. &#8220;Starlight, did you hear me? I feel like I&#8217;ve been screaming.&#8221;
<br />

<br />
[You were.]
<br />

<br />
&#8220;.......What?&#8221;
<br />

<br />
[You were talking to someone in your dreams. It sounded like.....you were talking to Jesi.]
<br />

<br />
A chill washed over Dirk, but he got weakly to his feet.  &#8220;Well this is a fix, eh? No jumpjets, no transport, and no shelter. Any ideas?&#8221;
<br />

<br />
[There has to be some transports left behind. It looked like it was a team of twenty men, and you put down six. A standard light transport-the only kind they could have gotten over here because of the no-fly zones- holds four to six people and a bedroom to sleep in.]
<br />

<br />
&#8220;I can&#8217;t fly one. The last flying course I took was about five years old.&#8221; Dirk answered as he picked his way over the broken rocks towards the ruined temple. &#8220;And what happens if they linked the controls? Anyways, why do you think that they packed their troopers comfortably?&#8221;
<br />

<br />
[We&#8217;ll make do. Even if they had packed them like sardines, think about it. Ammunition. Armor. Food.. Probably some genetic equipment. I&#8217;m willing to bet we&#8217;ll have a spare. ]
<br />

<br />
&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you unstoppable.&#8221; He laughed. It was good to have at least one person rooting for him. &#8220;You do know these healing spells are a temporary thing, right? It&#8217;s basically jury-rigging.&#8221;
<br />

<br />
[Yes. You should be ok, though. As long as the transport holds medical supplies, that is.]
<br />

<br />
The sunlight filled the ruined structure as Dirk walked down the halls, searching for the room and it&#8217;s two unconscious occupants. Memories, happy ones, mocked his pain. The feeling of light-headedness began to grow as he lost more blood, leaving slightly reddened footsteps occasionally. He would pause about every five minutes to reseal the wounds and preserve blood.
<br />

<br />
[The spot where you left the two was around here.]
<br />

<br />
&#8220;I know.&#8221; Dirk pointed his weapon straight ahead, and as he strode forward he saw two tumbled forms.
<br />

<br />
&#8220;Wake up.&#8221; he said quietly, and tapped the kid&#8217;s helmet.
<br />

<br />
The sound of the pistol being pulled out and aimed at Dirk&#8217;s cracked visor was the rasp of metal on leather. Dirk stared down the muzzle of it, then as the kid fired he grinned as the bullet bounced off the shield he had prudently put up first and clattered to the floor with a ringing like silvery bells.
<br />

<br />
Dirk struck the pistol out of his captive&#8217;s hands. Captive, because both of them knew who was in charge. The woman stirred-then leapt up with weapon out, dropping it down as the kid quietly urged her.
<br />

<br />
&#8220;You&#8217;re taking me to your transport, and then where I say. Do as I say and you won&#8217;t be killed, and we may actually come to a more firm, profitable partnership in the future.&#8221;
<br />

<br />
&#8220;And if we refuse?&#8221; the young man asked. Dirk grinned like the Grim Reaper.
<br />

<br />
&#8220;I&#8217;ll kill you and steal your transport anyways. What&#8217;s inconvenient for me is fatal for you. Choose.&#8221;
<br />

<br />
The man&#8217;s shoulders slumped in defeat, and he removed his helmet. The woman did likewise and Dirk, as a sign of respect, removed his.
<br />

<br />
The young man was tall and fair of face. He was blond, slightly reddish, haired, and had a firm, honest face that spoke of a sense of honor and a thoughtful nature. His slightly pointed ears spoke of elven blood, and he had a thin, wiry build. He looked very out-of-place in heavy armor and carrying an adamantine broadsword. He didn&#8217;t look terribly strong, but he was very, very fast.  His blue eyes were piercing, a lot like those of a bird of prey.
<br />

<br />
The woman, on the other hand, was dusky skinned, like desert sand at sundown, and possessed a smoldering beauty, dark haired and fine-boned, the sort that challenged a man as well as tempting him.  Her eyes were dark and deep, her face was classically beautiful, and her figure was quite nice. Her build was deceptively slight, but from a second&#8217;s study Dirk knew hers was a strength that showed itself only when needed, much like his own. She looked at him with barely held contempt and hatred, while the boy looked more curious and nervous then angry. Her features were that of an erudite/human crossbreed, a rare combination indeed.
<br />

<br />
&#8220;What&#8217;s your names?&#8221; Dirk asked quietly.
<br />

<br />
&#8220;Privates second class Eris and Scott.&#8221; the young man answered, pointing to his comrade first and then himself.
<br />

<br />
&#8220;All right, Eris, Scott. Take me to your transport, then set up it&#8217;s route for wherever you were intending to take me.&#8221; Dirk smiled grimly. &#8220;I need to have a few....words with your boss.&#8221;
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Nall fired another bolt even as he clenched his fist. &#8220;Mana Wave!&#8221;  The blast of energy left Aquamarine feeling numb and her other projectile weapon in shambles. She threw the ruined thing aside and glowed bright white for a second.
<br />

<br />
&#8220;Nanoflare!&#8221; She hurled a ball of white-hot flame at Nall, who managed to dodge and counter with a strike from his sword. She gripped the blade. &#8220;LET GO!&#8221; she cried.
<br />

<br />
&#8220;Fat chance!&#8221; He pulled back.
<br />

<br />
&#8220;Easy there, boy! We&#8216;ve just met!&#8221; Nall distinctly heard the female voice. Combat stopped abruptly.
<br />

<br />
&#8220;Did you say that?&#8221; he asked, looking at Aquamarine.
<br />

<br />
She shook her head.
<br />

<br />
&#8220;Down here.&#8221; Nall looked down and saw only the jeweled sword.
<br />

<br />
&#8220;Where?&#8221;
<br />

<br />
&#8220;Are you always this thick?&#8221; The sword was talking! Aquamarine snickered, but Nall flushed.
<br />

<br />
&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;
<br />

<br />
&#8220;Name&#8217;s Atwight. I-&#8221;
<br />

<br />
A sudden flash interrupted the sword&#8217;s words, and the next thing he knew Nall was struggling as a man grabbed him from behind and held a wet rag smelling of chemicals to his mouth. His vision grew dim, and he only barely heard Aquamarine&#8217;s screams of protest as she was knocked out, and sank down into a welcome darkness.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>
