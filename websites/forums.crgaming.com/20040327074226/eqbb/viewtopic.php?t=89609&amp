<br />
      
<br />

<br />
       The Gloom that covered the moor, was Errie and silent.Nothing moved, Nothing breathed. Not even the winds blew here, the Trees 
<br />
were all dead or dying. This land was sick, it Disgusted the only life in the area. She sighed as she looked about, her eyes filled with tears, she needed to leave here... forever.
<br />
      Her name was Hynea, she was half Elf, and half wolf, her skin was nut brown like any elfs, her hairwas as black as the moonless night, her eyes were Grayish blue , her ears  were longer then any elf's and she had a long black tail. She walked the dead lands as if the life left was presious. Somehow... Somehow she would heal this destrution, and stop it. 
<br />
    Hynea's Sharp ears picked up a strange moaning sound.She turned to look in the direction of the sound, she frowned. Someone was still alive? She needed to help them. She darted off catiounly towards the sound. She soon came into sight of a small colapsed building the moaning came again... it came from within. Hynea Snarled. she began to lift stone by stone away until it was wide enough to let her pass. she peered Catiounsly within, blackness... darkness... She stepped within untrustingly, when her feet touched the stone floor everything light up, the walls the floor... the stone!
<br />
    Hynea glaced around, the moaning was much closer, she swallowed her fear and moved on. She went down the large corridor untill a statue was before her. At the foot of the statue a young elven man sat weakened and dyeing she was feeling his lifeforce fade. She went to him, ad touched his pale cheeks. His eyes opened and he looked around.
<br />
    "Heeeelllpp me ...... Pleeeasee." his voice was rasping, he was near death.
<br />
    "I will try." She held the stranger in her arms lettin her magic and lifeforce flow through him.She noticed a beautiful stone in his hand clasped tightly, she opened his hand rather difficultly and took the stone, she examined it....
<br />
      The Stone of the Wind Rider! it was 1 of 3 stones ancient stones...
<br />
The Stone of the Wind Rider, The Stone of the Storm Caller, and the Storm of the Wave Crasher.They are said to all be used by one... did this man think he was that one? She bit her lip. If the stones are held by someone, it was not ment for their lifeforce would be drained and they would die... Why wasnt she having the same effects?
<br />
    Was she the one? Was she the one told by legand.She sighed.
<br />
    The man's eyes fluttered open. He looked up at her then at the stone she was examining. Hynea , looked down at him and smiled.
<br />
   "Are you feeling better?"
<br />
   "Yes , that stone... Why do you have that stone... it was mine.." he sighed.
<br />
    "This Stone is what almost killed you." his eyes were wide.
<br />
     "I see. Who are you? My name is Alulen."
<br />
     "I am known as Hynea, the Wolf of the forest."
<br />
     "Ive imanged meeting you before but i never knew you were... so well... Nice.." he muttered.
<br />
      "That isnt what you were thinking." She smiled at him." Since you found this stone, would you like to help me get the others? With them i might be able to restore this land to what it once was."
<br />
      "I would love too Hynea." He grinned.
<br />
      "Do you have any idea where the other stones are?"
<br />
      "Maybe. The Stone of the Storm Caller would be in the temples of the Rathetear Nimbus mountains, The Stone of the Wave  Crasher would be in the lost city of Atlantis."
<br />
      "As the books say." She smiled and rose to her feet gracefully. Alulen followed in suit.

<br />

<br />

<br />
The wolf-elf and the wood elf left the ruined temple into the lands of the dead forest moor. The smell of decay, overwhelmed them, the trees fell in clumps, all that was left of animals where their skeletons. Hynea lead them into a open feild that was her home as a child. A statue of a beautiful wood elf stand in the center in a mid casting pose, Alulen found it amazing art. Hynea smiled at him then moved gracefully and steathfully to a caved in cottege. She disapeared into the gloom of the old home for several minutes. Alulen still examined the Statue. 
<br />

<br />
He felt Hynea's presence at his shoulder. "That was my mother."
<br />

<br />
alulen looked at her. "How could a statue be your mother?"
<br />

<br />
Hynea smiled sadly. " The old Legends are mostly True about me and the small band of other half breeds. My mother died from the peterfing stare of a set of demons at the age of 9, i killed the Squads leader, only to find my mother lost to me."
<br />

<br />
"You are truely amazing ,Hynea." Alulen said grinning at her. He had legends about her many times but he never thought if them as true. Legend told that Hynea a young girl had single handedly fended off 100's of demon's, all while her companions went after A Acient sword, that is said to have great power. the Sword was stolen, by a evil hearted wolf that was father to one of her companions.Anther told of how her magic had grown strong enough to counter thoughs of the gods. Her healing , offence, and defence spells were all secound nature to her, even the ones that others would find immpossible to cast.
<br />

<br />
Hynea un-sheathed a beautifully crafted rune marked scimitar, She swung it around testing it. "Still as good as it was all thoughs years ago." 
<br />

<br />

<br />
Alulen just stared at her." Where too?"
<br />

<br />
"Nimbus." Hynea said simply. She looked back at the state of her mother. "Good bye mother."
<br />

<br />

<br />
Alulen and Hynea traveled the dying lands for several days, long terrible days. That made the only thing they wish for was the marrow, and a way from the moor's gloom and death. Brightnes of the plains overwhlemed them , as they stepped from the gloom. Hynea sheilded her eyes , it had been years since she had been from the gloom of the moor. The Long grasses of the open plains the bright sun looming over head. Their Treck led them through the Karanna's plains the lush green to the deep desert all rich with life. Hynea smiled as the antalope raced catiously pass, Centure's raised their bow's threateningly as they watch carefully over their calf's. Elephants snorted and wandered. Lions roared nd hunted. it was basically paridise for life. But it all too soon ended. Gloom and death soon overwhelmed them once more. 
<br />

<br />
 skeletons  of animals and trees lay dead and the mountain's loomed over head. Tornado's and swift gust's of dust rushed past. Thunderstorms stuck and set fire to many near by things. even the waters of the near by lake seemed to be filled with death. Fish floated lifelessly catching fire every now and then, the water float sickly and green.
<br />

<br />
The only sign of life was a distant howl. The howl of a wolf. Hynea's wolf's ears perked and howled. Anther howl returned. Alulen stared as Hynea let out many howl's and yelps.
<br />

<br />
"Hynea, it has been a long time." a tall figure appoached them. He had Long silver hair and Green-yellow eyes.He wore light leather chain-mail.
<br />

<br />
"Hello Nark. How's Neoly?"
<br />

<br />
"She's  in better parts." Nark sighed "With the kids."
<br />

<br />
"Seen Seon?"
<br />

<br />
"Nope i havent seen him in years."  He looked at Alulen. "Why are you here? And Got yourself a boyfriend? i havent seen you try at someone since Seon barked at you." 
<br />

<br />
Hynea Blushed. "He isnt my boyfriend just a companion. and im here because of this." She raised the glowing orb in her hand. Stone of the Wind rider. Nark gaped at her. 
<br />

<br />
"Really now? She your Girlfriend elf?"
<br />

<br />
Alulen Glared. "No." He blushed at the thought "She too good for me." he sighed. 
<br />

<br />
Nark Howled with laughter. 
<br />

<br />
Nark Nodded to the Mountains, and sighed."I have been living in these mountains, for several years, life here has drindled, to just a few shrubs, and insects." 
<br />

<br />
"It is sad; in my own homeland it has done that as well, everything was dead or dieing. Thats when i found Alulen there near death, and with this stone." Hynea said holding the stone of the windrider up again.
<br />

<br />
"Maybe the stones are effecting the life of the area they are in indicating that they are needed."
<br />

<br />
"maybe" alulen and Hynea muttered in union.
<br />

<br />
"Well you two should get up tha peak then. I need to get the hell out of hear bout time i saw my wife dont you think?" Nark said with a grin.
<br />

<br />
Hynea chuckled "yes yes Go on."
<br />

<br />
Hynea started for the mountains Alulen followed her only to be stopped by the grip of Nark. "She isnt as head strong as she was , she;s wiser , take care of her, and she will do the same to you. she;s been a woman of her word since she was what a wee girl. Be careful. " Nark let go of him and began to walk away towards the karana's. Alulen ran to catch up to Hynea.
<br />

<br />
Light Mist, ravor sharp rocks and the gray- dead skys were all that they saw as they climbed through the mountains. The forests of the foot hills long left behind with their death. yet the gloom and decay followed them through the mountains. The mist thickened, as they started down anther mountain of the peaks. A Anceint temple apeared in the valley, made of durrable old stone, even still pillars lay collapsed all about the couple. 
<br />

<br />
Crimson eyes came from no where in particular. "Demons...." Hynea breathed in recongition. Little did she know these were no ordnary demons. Several small demons came from no were tackleing Alulen to the ground, Their clawed hands grapsed his flesh an aura of pure mana surrouned the demons and their captive. They could drain a persons mana!
<br />

<br />
Hynea Skillfully drew her scimitar slicing the tiny demons in peices. "You okay ?"
<br />

<br />
"Thanks to you yes......" alulen rose to his feet " I am betting we need something that isnt mana. The stone...."
<br />

<br />
"What do you mean? Ive tried to invoke the power but i havent been able too." 
<br />

<br />
"Your holding back!" 
<br />

<br />
Hynea's attention went to her scimitar, it was envloped in green light. Her eyes widened as the light surrouned her body. Alulen gaped at her as her form changed. A Black wolf with 2 pairs of wings and 2 tails stood before him around its neck The stone of the wind rider hung on a chain glowing  faintly. The wolf bowed on its fronts indicating it wanted Alulen to get on its back. Alulen Got on the wolf and put his arms around the beasts neck. 
<br />

<br />
The wolf Howled , and spred its wings taking flight. The demons beneith scattered as wind of blades crashed into them. The Wolfish Hynea dived into the temple. it landed gracefully before a old decaying shrine. it appeared as if the demons knew to keep their distance. The wolf shimmered and returned back into Hynea's orginal form. "Get off me alulen!" She Snarled. 
<br />

<br />
Alulen blushed and rose off of her. "Sorry." He picked her from the ground. 
<br />

<br />
"Where the... What the.... What just happened?!" 
<br />

<br />
"You Turned into a wolf scared them demons off and took us into the temple." 
<br />

<br />
Hynea scowled, as she moved into the shrine, leaving Alulen staring. She emerged carrying a dull sky blue stone. "We got it!" 
<br />

<br />
"Woot! Yay!" alulen grinned at her. 
<br />

<br />
"You crack me up." she laughed at him. Hynea stared at him as he approached her." Something wrong?"
<br />

<br />
"No , not at all." he said putting his arms around her, making her glance around. Her eyes widened as his face came against her own. 
<br />

<br />
"Alulen....." Was all she could say before he kissed her. A Warm sensation flooded through her body, her arms went around his neck. She blinked when he released her. "Alulen....." she repeated. 
<br />

<br />
"I'm sorry..."
<br />

<br />
Hynea didnt respond , but doubled over from warm pain comming from her chest and hand.... The Stone of the Windrider hung around her neck and the Stone of the Storm caller was held in her hand. Her breathing hastened, as she lost sight of her surrondings. She felt like screaming. As white hot  pain seared through her, then all went black.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Hynea moaned, as her eyes oponed all she saw were two gray loomed over her. She heard voices but couldnt make them out. a Warm hand touched her cheek. She moaned again, she couldnt remember anything that happened resently. her thoughts drifted back to 20 years ago. 
<br />

<br />
Red demon eyes glinted in the gloom of the caveren , exhausten over whelmed her. Her trusty scimitar in hand, it glowed green, and envloped her body. a Strange presence that guided her destroyed the hundereds of demons that surounded her and her coliges. When all were destroyed she stood in the center of their blood and corpses, and suddenly returned to herself, only to meet blackness. 
<br />

<br />
She sat up her eyes wide , her breathing hastened; she was beng held she relized... That very presence that was within her all thoughs years ago...... was within her again! She Stood against the ars that held her and ran into the gloom of the dead forest near by. She didnt know how long she ran but she ran until she colapsed of exhausten. What Was happening to her?!?! Why was she so Confused? What is the Presence within her? She Screamed then... a high pitched soul chilling scream. 
<br />

<br />
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<br />

<br />
Alulen watched Hynea run off into the wood, Nark's hand clasped on his shoulder preventing him from presueing her. Until his grip released when a Scream sounded in the distance. That Scream chilled their blood, it peirced their souls... 
<br />

<br />
"Hynea!" Alulen Breathed, as he moved towards the wood, only to be stopped by Nark again. "Let me go She needs my help." 
<br />

<br />
"She needs no one. She needs to find herself." Nark said, coldly.
<br />

<br />
"What do you mean? Release me!" 
<br />

<br />
"No i will not. She needs to be alone she needs to find herself. Hynea is a survivor, she has simply lost herself. Alulen you love her. I can sence it."
<br />

<br />
Alulen fell to his knees, he did love her, he didnt know why, he had a girlfriend back in Kelethan long forgotten. If he went with Hynea his family friends and anyone who cared about him would be lost, to him. He didnt care, he wanted to be with her. A pleasurable , hurtful  sensation filled him. It was a new sensation to him. "God help her..." 
<br />

<br />
Nark smirked at him. "You are foolish boy, she can only help herself." 
<br />

<br />
"pfft,  Nark dont you think she has changed at all since you knew her?"
<br />

<br />
"She's  become wiser, stronger, less head strongedly, yet she is the same person i knew twenty years ago."  
<br />

<br />
Anther scream chilled the air, renewing the yerning for Alulen to get near her. Nark wouldnt let him move towards the wood."  She is finding herself. Let her be." Nark's gaze shifted to a solitary figure approaching the two men. "Well ill be a monkeys uncle... Neoly." 
<br />

<br />
Alulen stared as a beautiful wood elf with wolfish features approached them. She was aged , but had gray blue eyes and midnight black hair. " Hello , my love. Who is this?" She said to Nark asking about Alulen.
<br />

<br />
"Heh, Hynea's man."
<br />

<br />
Neoly laughed gently , and Alulen scowled at Nark. " Where is Hynea? " 
<br />

<br />
"Ran off into the forest. She needs to find herself." 
<br />

<br />
"I see." Neoly said simply and walked off into the wood in the direction Hynea ran hours earlier. 
<br />

<br />
"So you let her go yet not me." 
<br />

<br />
Nark laughed " Hynea and my wife are good friends. Hynea might rather talk to anther woman who;s gone through hell and back then a little elf like yourself."
<br />

<br />
"Im not little" 
<br />

<br />
"Thats what all little ones say!" 
<br />

<br />
"Your not being funny." Alulen said simply and looked into the full mooned night sky , over whelming pain filled him. Alulen Grapsed his head and snarled inhumanly. Nark stared at him, Nark moved away from him. Alulen Howled like a wolf, his body and face took the form of a silver large wolf. He looked extically like Heah.  Alulen looked over to Nark, who was snarling his teeth bared and sword drawn. What was going on??? 
<br />

<br />
Just then a gasp and twig snapping alreted to the presence of Hynea and Neoly both were scowling. "Heah How dare you show your acursed face after all this time!?" Hynea said unsheathing her scimitar. 
<br />

<br />
"Thats impossible Heah died!" Neoly muttered. "Nark what happened?" 
<br />

<br />
Nark  choked the words. "Alulen turned into Heah...." Hynea glaced at him and fell to her knees. 
<br />

<br />
Alulen wanted to lick her face, as tears formed rivers on her cheeks. But Neoly's glare told him to keep his distance. a new Voice startled them all. 
<br />
"It is simple enough to anwser." 
<br />

<br />
They all jumped. A cloaked figure said.
<br />

<br />
"What is?"
<br />

<br />
"The fact that this pure blooded elf turned into a wolf and looked extically like Heah."
<br />

<br />
"How is that simple?" Neoly snarled. 
<br />

<br />
"When Heah was killed his soul was purefied and as well as the magics contained withhim him were all freed. The soul and magics wandered for a time and probly settled in this boy when he wasnt even born yet."
<br />

<br />
"I see, who are you?"
<br />

<br />
"You should know that my sister."  Seon removed the cowl of his cloak. Hynea looked up at him and sighed. 
<br />

<br />
Alulen looked around. So he had the soul and magics of these peoples mortal emeny. That was probly why the demons attacked him earlier. He looked back at the full moon, as pain sheered through him again returnd to himself. He was surprised when Hynea flung herself on him, they laughed when the two hit the ground. The older three laughed then moved to talk with each other and catch up on old times.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<br />
	The sun rose in the clear skies of the earlier morn.Alulen yawned as he looked groggly around the camp he saw Seon not far off contained in his own thoughts, Hynea was no where to be seen.Seon noticed the elf and smiled at him. "Get over 'ere kiddo." Seon called him over. Alulen stood and went to join the aged wolf-elf.
<br />
	
<br />
"Aye?"
<br />
	
<br />
"Nuttin' really, Just a lil curious.. And need to rely  a message from Hynea. Hynea went into the mountains alone to think she needed to be to herself for awhile, and im curious as to how close you and her are, Hynea's a difficult gal she is, She can be your friend on moment the next her sworn advasari. I think its because she trusts no one really."  
<br />

<br />
"Alright, i can see why she went off alone, but i gess me and her are... close enough for how long we've been together."Alulen scratched a imaginary irritation on the back of his head." I dunno ive become fond of her ... really fond, but i dont know how she feels about me."
<br />
	
<br />
Seon smiled stifling a laugh. "She cares alot about you, i think she's old enough to settle with someone." With that the older wolf-elf disapeared into the shadows.
<br />
	
<br />
Alulen watched him go, then sat alone by himself away from the remaining Nark and Neoly who finally awoke.
<br />
	
<br />
Hynea returned when the sun was high in the sky , she came into the camp silently a deep claw mark on her cheek, it seemed she had faced a battle. She seated herself next to Alulen."Lets go to Faydwer." 
<br />
 	
<br />
"By boat?"
<br />
	
<br />
"Aye, bought time I went to Kelethan."
<br />
	
<br />
"Well lets go then!" Alulen grinned i had been months since he had left kelethan. "Its been awhile since ive been there myself!"
<br />
	
<br />
The two disapeared from the camps and traveled days strait to reach Freeports busy streets and docks, where they awaited a boat, when it finally came they boarded quietly. About midway through the Shipride nearing Sister Isle, Goblins jumped aboard grinning stupidly. 
<br />
	
<br />
Alulen's eyes narrowed as the light-blue skinned Aqua goblin's the surrouned himself and Hynea. Storm clouds loomed over-head and lighting illumanted the skies , sea and deck. The goblins grinned then charged, Hynea began to cut the creatures down one by one. Alulan on the other-hand had no weapon as he bit his lip and was in trouble from this, The goblins grabbed him and pain seared through him. He once again took Heah's form. The Crimson eyed goblins jumped back as he tore through several of their comrades and blood covered his silver coat.
<br />
	
<br />
Goblin's were ugly creatures , they wore almost no clothing ushally having blue or green skin, they had horrizontal oval shapped heads, that had Bulging eyes and wide toothy grins their ears were pointed and somewhat elfish looking. Their bellies often bulged with the last nights feast right over their single garment, a loun cloth. They were somewhat dangerus with their crude weapons. Nevertheless Hynea and Alulen tore through them, soon goblin corpses littered the deck as well as their blood. They rain from the skies washed the the blood into the sea , and the sailors thrust the corpses into the waters. 
<br />

<br />
A figure in the shadows had watched the whole event, a smile crept across his young wolfish face. He had plans for these two...
<br />
	
<br />
The ship crept across the sea's slowly docking for a few hours at sister Isle then continueing to Butcher-block mountains , its main destanation. The two travalers, woman and wolf left the ship their shadowy followed hastened to follow their quick pace. little did the three know evil and danger crept in these mountains and forest lands, a Great evil, even that Hynea in her wolf-ish form or the stones could be a match for.. since he held the third stone... He was undead in a way so he could use the stones freely. The undead had no lifeforce to give therefore they could use the stones...
<br />

<br />
	Hynea finally slowed her pace as they neared Kelethan both Alulen and the shadow were out of breath. Their chests heaved as they breathed Hynea smiled at Alulen out of the corner of the eye she saw their shadow not really caring, alot of cloaked figures wandered around the elfish city. "im ganna go talk to some old friends ." Alulen said  as he moved towards the lift , She smiled at him, knowin that he had many friends here. She decided she would find someone too, she didnt know who to look for though. She just ran through the wood until she ran into  a tall cloaked figure. 
<br />
	
<br />
"You'll pay for that wench!" The figure rose to his feet and began to cast a spell a sea green stone around his neck glowed virgorlessly,  a giant sized wave crashed into Hynea sending her into a tree. She rose to her feet again and pull her scimitar free, it evenloped her in Greenlight turning her into the winged-wolf once more.
<br />
	
<br />
She howled and dodged some of the waves, others hit her dead on . The stone of the Windrider and the Stone of the Storm caller glowed viriously, she returned to a wolfish-elfish self. She yelped as the stones changed her form, Wings grew on her back her ears turned into wingish-ears her other features changed slightly.  The cloaked figure gaped and began to cast, once more sending waves at her once more. she easly dodged them taking her scimitar in hand sliced into the creature.
<br />
	
<br />
"You may have killed me but you wont defeat my master Mayong Mistmoore, Master of the Vampires!" Hynea sighed and fell to her knees retakeing her orginal form taking the 3rd stone from the minyons corpse. She would go find Alulen now.
<br />
************************************************************************************
<br />
	
<br />
Alulen noticed his old girlfriend in the Taveren, her waitress cloths hugged her  form tightly and the men pinched at her. She came by him a few times not noticing him, finally she noted his preasence and took a seat across from him." Been awhile Alulen! Where the hell were you? I was worried sick! Bah, I dont even know why i care for you anymore!"She snarled.
<br />
	
<br />
"Well ladyduhday, I've almost been killed at least 5 times in the last couple weeks! Yet you dont have a care in the world! Damn you woman!"
<br />
	
<br />
"Wow, you were almost killed that many times by whom? have a worse neimisuss i should know about?!"	
<br />
	
<br />
"Uhh, no. It's just the woman i been traveling with."
<br />
	
<br />
"WHAT?! your cheating on me! You Bastard!" She smacked him.
<br />
	
<br />
"No..... its just danger followers her where ever she gose so im just trying to repay my dept to her, she saved my life."	
<br />
	
<br />
"What ever as far as im conserned We're through you damned bastard!" She slapped him again then went to serve some of the others of the bar. One of Alulen's human friends saw what was going on and went over to talk to him.
<br />
	
<br />
"She's feisty as ever, that Keekyuto." Tahitian said muttering.
<br />
	
<br />
"Of course. Oh well who needs her? She;s a bar maid bet she's been playng part time whore."
<br />
	
<br />
Tahitian laughed at that. "Probly! Pleasure to the Drunks!" He laughed again, but his attention went to the door as it swung opon, an Exhausted looking Hynea stood there scanning the crowd. She spotted who she was looking for and went to sit with Alulen and Tahitian. Tahitian eyed her and grinned at Alulen. "She your new Traveling companion Alulen? "
<br />
	
<br />
"Shut it mister." Keekyuto whacked him over the head with her serving tray, She eyed Hynea jeoliously then Alulen. "Hrmmph," she muttered and attempted to hit Hynea with the tray as well, Hynea caught it with her hand easily.
<br />
	
<br />
"There a problem miss?"
<br />
	
<br />
Keekyuto gaped at her. "Not really. Uhh..... Your with Alulen?!"
<br />
	
<br />
" Yeah ,so?"
<br />
	
<br />
"Alulen! i hate you , you bastard!" Keekyuto said and disapeared into the crowd.
<br />
	
<br />
"What was her problem?" Hynea asked.
<br />
	
<br />
"She Alulen's Ex-girlfriend."
<br />
	
<br />
Hynea and Alulen laughed in uninison.
<br />
	
<br />
"A little of  a feisty bitch...." Alulen muttered. 
<br />
	
<br />
Laughter up formed from the threes mouths once more.

<br />
	Hynea told them of the encounter she had had with Mayong's Minyon, They spoke of it for several minutes before desiding that they needed to kill the Vampire lord before he killed them. Their plan wasnt the best bein that  it was thought up in about fove minutes. Tahitian said he was comming since it had been months since he had done anything exciting. Tahitian would sneak in first delay the vampires and taking their attention away from the two that would sneak in and find Mayong. The plan was simple enough but it wasnt full proof.	
<br />
	The Three  rose un-aware of the Shadow that watched them,he watched them leave the taveren.He began to follow them un-emontonly he knew this would mean his death was very possible. He followed the un-aware quarry through Kelethan and the lush forest land of the Greater faydarks. The company and their mysterious shadow entere the mist enshrounded forest lands of Lesser Faydark. 
<br />
	As they steadedly set through the  forest they heard tormented neighs of a horse, they grew louded and closer each moment. The shadow knew what it was, for he had faced the beast before Memories flooded through him. He was Son of a pair of half breeds that had joined a wolf pack, the pack hd become crowded in their own homeland and moved into the Lesser faydark. Hours after arriving they heard tormented neighs and soft cladding of a horses feet on the damp earth. No sooner had the creature attacked them, a Black mair with crimson glowing eyes attacked. Almost instantly it killed half the pack, all was left was the him as a young child and his parents. He remembered his white haired young mother throwing herself before her husband and son yelling to them to run. His father Grabbed him instantly tears flooding his gray-blue eyes his black hair flying behind him as he ran. As promised the Crimson eyed mair appeared , it gave a in-horse shreek and charged them it knocked Alulen to the ground then knocked Tahitian into a near by tree it turned and shreeked again as it charged Hynea. the Shadow bit his lip he drew a sword his uncle had given him when he was a boy. He Growled deeply making the maire and the rest of the company peer at him. The Maire reconized him in a instant, and shreiked again. It charged him digging her hoves into his chest making his cowl of his cloak fall back as he hit the ground. Hynea gaped at him "..... Seon...." 
<br />
	The Maire jumped off of him ready again to charge him. The shadow rose to his feet weakly "I'm not Seon.... I'm his son." He said  dodging the maire. " a Lil help here?" 
<br />
	Hynea Nodded and drew her scimitar and charged the maire driving it into the beasts back. Seon's Son lept into the air delivering a flying kick to the maire's head, killing it. the young man helped Tahitian to his feet,  Alulen was propped up on a elbow mumbling to himself. "Names Seaker" the man muttered to them. "I gess I'll help yeh'all out."
<br />
	"How did you know to  where to find us, Seaker?" Hynea asked holding Alulen up.
<br />
	Seaker sighed "I've been following you and Alulen since you got on the boat here."
<br />
	Hynea and the other two just stared at him "i should have sensed your presence."
<br />
	He smiled " I'm like a shadow." 
<br />
	They rested from the pounding the maire delivered then continued their treck towards mistmore castle. Hynea studied Seaker for a moment he looked like Seon besides his yellow eyes and silver hair strands. He was also taller than his father and looked more serious she noted a sword sheathed at his waiste. He looked over at her and smiled. "Something the matter Hynea?" 
<br />
	"No nothing , you look alot like Seon..."
<br />
	"Heh, oh well i take after my mum, even if she is dead..."
<br />
	"Hynea pay attention to the matter at hand." Alulen said tugging her wolfish ear.
<br />
	"Arggh , Alrighty... Seaker i gess you can help Tahitian out with the Vamps." 
<br />
	"Sure Thing."
<br />
	"I'm not working with show off here!"
<br />
	"Shut it Human before i slice you in two." Seaker muttered slightly annoyed.
<br />
	"Oooh, Look he wants to slice me into peices."
<br />
	"Calm down you two!" Alulen howled.
<br />
	"Please." hynea agreed.
<br />
	"I'm not working with a show off wolf."
<br />
	"Your just jeolious i finished that damned maire."
<br />
	"So who cares if i am?!"
<br />
	"Maybe you should sallow your pride hotshot , we ganna be part of something great, human."
<br />
	"How the hell do you know?!"
<br />
	"Dose it really matter? lets just sallow our pride work together for now then we can cut eachothers heads off later."
<br />
	"That sounds good" Hynea and Alulen said in union.
<br />
	They stopped talking at the sight of the Mistmoore Castle. Tahitian and Seaker both ran into the mist enshrouded courtyard. Alulen took Hynea's hands and kissed her." If either of us dont make it through this..."
<br />
	Her finger on his lips stopped what he was saying " We will make it through this... Stop kidding yours...." Her words were interupted by the shreiks and howls of vampires, alulen and hynea nodded to each other and ran into the castle grounds sticking the to the shadows that enveloped this place.
<br />
	The stones around Hynea's neck began to pulsate and she felt a warm sensation at her waist where her Scimitar was sheathed, Alulen's form shimmered and he again turned into a Silver wolf.It seemed mana was in the air here reacting with magic talismens and properties within a person. The two intruders stalked the halls and corridors. Vampires rushed pass them several times either not noticing or not caring, they seemed to be in a hurry.  After what seemed endless minutes they reached the throne room of the castle. It seemed emtey and lifeless...  Dust covered everything and the air was sour. Hynea and Alulen loomed over the rooms items not sure what to do next. The Latter began to snarl , he then yelped in pain as he was flung into a stone wall. Hynea Jumped out the the way of  a ball of crimson mana. the two stones pulsated even harder enveloping Hynea in their magics. Alulen in the mean time was back on his feet snarled and began to glow himself. The magics of Heah Reainimated within him his eyes glowed crimson and he easyily dodged the crimson mana flung at him hynea join the fight her transformation complete. A set of crimson eyes appeared on a 6 foot tall figure.
<br />
	Mayong Mistmoore grinned as he stepped from the shadows, he casted a spell crashing a tsami into his guests. Hynea flew to the celing and howled in fury her eyes glowed with amber furry Alulen also was on his feet . The Great Vampire lord Jumped out of the way of their assults he smiled and again casted spells opon them. A Crimson ball of mana hit Alulen dead on he was slammed into a near by wall and knocked unconsios. The Vampire smiled as he moved to finish the elf off.  He had foolishly forgot the stone holder, he felt searing pain in his back as she stabbed him with her scimitar. He howled in furry and the blade sliced through him several times. Mayong mistmore fell to the ground becoming dust as he desingrated away. Hynea went to Alulen's side his breathing was faint and shallow his skin cold to the touch. Hynea bit her lip and lifted him over her shoulder, on her way from the throne room she stooped to pick up a Blue green stone, The Stone of the Wavecrasher.
<br />
	Together the four fled Castle Mistmoore it seemed Tahitian and Seaker had become friends durning the battle. Alulen recovered slowly and painfully. Finally on the fourth day after the death of the Vampire lord he awoke from his unconiosness. Asleep with her head on his bed side was Hynea it seemed she didnt want to leave his side. He patted her head making her awake it seemed he was back to a elf.
<br />
	"Alulen..." She hugged him."I was so worried..." 
<br />
	He smiled at her and held her for a time. "Hynea... You should use the stones for what they need to be used for... Heal the land heal the death and destruction that has befallen the lands.. I'll wait for you."
<br />
	She smiled at him she had never come out of her transformation as of yet. She picked the stone up from the table at his bedside her form began to shimmer in silver light  her great wings spread and she flew out of the room, from the faydarks and from the continet.

	A smiled crossed his face as he embrassed his newly returned love. The two had plans... they would be wed this night, and then leaving to lead a life of adventure. It seemd all was happy in the lands and nothing threatened them as of yet. The power of the 3 anceint stones and the once evil wolf would stop all in their tracks. Hynea and Alulen left Kelethan late that night their spirits high. Tahitian had returned to his home city of Quenoys to protect the inhabidents until he surcomed to a mysterious illness. Ironicly Seaker and Keekyuto were wed many months later...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>
