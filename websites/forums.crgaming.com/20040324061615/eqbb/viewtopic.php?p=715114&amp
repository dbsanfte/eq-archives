				<td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">A cold night in Neriak, throughout the walls of the deep cavern city the cries of a child could be heard.  A child is born, brought into this world like any other child, a father and a mother.  All throughout Norrath children were being born into loving caring families.
<br />
Not this child, his dark elven parents cared only about keeping their race strong.  A cold world indeed when a child is brought into this world with no love.  So he was destined to live as the others cold, heartless without love and passion.
<br />

<br />
	At a young age he was taken from his parents and brought to a guild of magic users, stripped from his parents grasp and torn away from what he would have called his only family.  Before he was taken his parents gave him one thing a name, the boys name was Halcion.  His time was spent perfecting his mind and his body for the strains his magic would force upon him.  In most ways he wasn’t unlike any other student at the guild, but that was to be expected they were all trained to be alike and never question.  There were a few peculiarities about this child that the guild leaders did see; one was quite obvious in his appearance his shimmering purple eyes were unlike that of any other elf they had ever seen before.  For this fact even in his own city he was an outcast and a freak.  The other was his lack of devotion to the dark elven god, the lord and creator of his race, Innoruuk.  He was an outcast in his own small world.
<br />

<br />
	Halcion creeped quietly as he set out during that dark moonless night for he knew if he was heard leaving the city at this hour the guards would be upon him and drag him back to that hole he had called home for the last twelve years.  As he made his way through the dank caves he slipped past many of guards using his powerful yet inexperienced magic.  Hiding himself from the gaze of others he left the gates of Neriak far behind him as he set out towards the common lands.
<br />

<br />
	He had long heard stories about the people of this world and the foul deeds they had done against his people, so when he stepped out into the morning light of the eastern commons and saw the land filled with many children about his own age of different races he felt a great hatred towards them as the played in clearings.  Grumpy and a bit sleepy from his long nights travel he made his way to an inn to buy some food and water with the bit of silver he had taken before he left his home.  He could hear the snickers of the other children ask he walked up to the inn door, hearing comments about his purple robe.  None the less he shook it off, his robe was a symbol of his chosen path, that of an enchanter.  As he stepped into the inn he could smell the food and hear the people around him, he could almost feel all the life in this room tugging at his soul.  What he could feel was the broom of an inn keeps wife as she chased him out and back into the common lands.  
<br />

<br />
	He could have guessed he wouldn’t have been welcome, with his stomach growling and his body aching he found a solid tree with much shade to rest against.  In his dreams he could imagine himself back home, feeling the hot air as he passed the forge on his way to the jewelers shop to watch him work.  But the hot air was very real and not a dream, he opened his eyes slowly to find himself staring into the mouth of a hungry lion.  He winced in anticipation as he knew he was surely done for, a force rippled through the air and Halcion could feel it.  Opening his eyes he saw the lion with an unblinking gaze and a glassy look in his eyes.  He stood up and walked away slowly, the lion never moved, never twitched.  He slammed hard into something and his feet gave way as he met the ground, when he managed to right himself he found a boy around his age only much taller and with dark skin.
<br />
	
<br />
	“Your lucky I came along when I did, you were about to become this lions midday meal.” The young eurdite chuckled at Halcion.  Extending his hand the eurdite lifted the dark elf off the ground and onto his feet.  “My name is Osuen; I’m an enchanter of the land of Eurdin.  I have come to these lands searching high and low for bits and pieces of a quest I have embarked on.”  The dark elf stared blankly at Osuen for a minute not knowing what to make of this strange boy.  Remembering his teachings, he spoke in common tongue so the boy could understand “I’m Halcion, I’m also an enchanter, but I don’t come from anywhere I have no home.  Now I bid you a good day before I lose my patience with you.”
<br />

<br />
	As the dark elf turned to walk away, something sparked his interest.  His keen eyesight had locked onto the contents spilling out of Osuen’s pouch.  “A quest you say? Let me see your pouch.” the dark elf grumbled eyeing Osuen up and down.  Osuen handed over his pouch without a second thought, such trust for a creature he had never met before.  Rambling through, Halcion’s eyes lit up as he recognized the items and could recall thoughts of this quest himself.
<br />
“I shall help you with your quest; I have read many a books and studied along time.  The only thing I ask of you is that we also get the item for myself to.” They agreed and began making their way to the docks for the boat ride to Eurdin where the next step of this journey would take them.
<br />

<br />
	As they made their way, a strange force rippled through the air as a high elf passed them by.  Osuen grabbed Halcion by the arm and raced to the high elf. “Excuse me sir, is it really you?  Are you really master Xornn?” Osuen stumbled with his words in excitement.  The high elf smiled slyly and chuckled as he looked at the odd traveling partners. “Why yes young one, I am Xornn why do you ask?”
<br />

<br />
	As Osuen and Xornn chatted, Halcion peered intently at the older high elf.  His robe was neat and clean with a large amount of work done to the images on the cloth.  “And who would this be?” Xornn questioned while pointing at the dark elf.  Halcion jumped at his voice, it wasn’t so much the surprise but the power behind the voice he could tell that Xornn was wise and powerful beyond his years and was not one to be fooled with.  “My name is Halcion, if you know that you know as much about me as anyone.  I am helping this boy with a quest for the Stein of Moggok, it’s a nice trinket for students of the arts like us.
<br />

<br />
	Xornn’s eyes flashed widely and his smile shown bright as he looked at the boys.  “Enchanters I see, well young men I shall journey with you and keep you guarded on your travels to the far off lands.  You see I have done this many of times and with me along it will only make it faster.”  The boys agreed to this and set off with Xornn.  A short bit later Xornn paid a young wood elf to transport them all to Toxxulia forest. 
<br />

<br />
	As the journey continued, Halcion found himself more entranced by the power and wisdom of the Fier`Dal.  The more the boy tried to figure out why Xornn was helping them out the more he was confused.
<br />
As they moved Xornn explained in great detail the life of an enchanter and to his surprise the two young boys were already full of knowledge of their chosen path.  “I’m no oracle but I see a great future for these boys.” Xornn quietly thought to himself.
<br />

<br />
	Both beaming with pride and joy over their newly finished quest, the boys thanked Xornn for his help and told him they’d be in touch.
<br />
Halcion and Osuen said their good byes, as Osuen departed the city of the Oggok.  As Xornn made ready to leave himself, he left a tug at his robe.  Turning he found the young dark elf looking at him intently. “Why did you do this?” said the puzzled boy. A light smirk crossed Xornn’s mouth as he began to speak.  “You see young one, I was once in your postion myself.  I remember what its like to be your age and so full of power, yet have no one to guide me along the right path.” said the wiry high elf as he turned to head out.  The next words from the boy’s mouth stunned Xornn, “Will you teach me?” mumbled the young boy.  A quiet yet powerful voice rang through Halcion’s heads as Xornn spoke, “Come with me young one.”  An unusual thing happened next, a smile, crossed the face of the young dark elf, an emotion of pleasure not prone to dark race.
<br />

<br />
	Eyes wide and observant, Halcion peered at the great structure before him.  A temple was not what he had planned to stumble upon in the dense jungle.  Carefully reading the scribed marks on the temple he realized what he had stumbled across, The Lost Temple of Cazic Thule.  A fear of the unknown quietly crept into the now young mans soul.  Showing little emotion he slipped quietly into the temple knowing he must not let the fear get the best of him, after all it was his job to know as much about the world around him as possible.
<br />

<br />
	As he worked his way into the temple he found a race of lizard men around him, not quite sure what to make of the dark elf they moved about their business.  His ears perked up, he could hear something in the distance, a cry?  As he closed his eyes and let his mind slip into a trance he bound his eyes to the nearest creature and commanded it to go to the sound.  Deep inside the temple he saw a young wood elven girl, surrounded by the lizard men who were getting ready to make prey of her.  Working quickly he vanished from sight and slipped deep into the heart of the temple, working his way to the girl hoping it wasn’t to late.  As she cried in the corner praying to Tunare, a burst of color surrounds her and the monsters.  Power flowed through the air grasping at the minds of the lizards and shutting them in a deep trance.  The girl rubbed her eyes trying to recover from the dazzling effect of the lights; she sees a young dark elf before her.  “Come with me, we have little time before they regain control of themselves.  The young girl resisted as Halcion grabbed her by the arm and began to run with her towards the temple exit.  A calming sense fell over her as Halcion’s magic began to work around her, calmed they rushed from the temple and were able to escape with their lives.
<br />

<br />
	Reaching the safety of the Rathe Mountains, the two teenagers collapsed against each other from the exhaustion of the ordeal.  Awakening from the cold of the night, Halcion finds himself next to the young wood elf as she sets up camp.  She cups her hands as light begins to spark from them, a burst of fire leaps forth from her hands and ignites the pile of wood before her.  As she looks up she finds the dark elf peering at her up and down.  She scoots to the opposite side of the fire being weary of the dark elf.  Halcion smirks at the young girl “What’s the matter never seen an enchanter before?”  She bites her lip trying to decide whether to dignify the elf with an answer.  “Well, my name is Halcion; it’s a pleasure to meet you…..”  Peering across the fire she opens her mouth as she begins to speak, then decides against the idea.  “I see, if my presence bothers you I can leave, just be more careful in dangerous places, I won’t always be around to save your life.” Halcion gets up to leave.  “Wait! I’m sorry, I’ve never been around a dark elf before, let alone kept company with one.  I’m Sarania, but my friends just call me Sara.”  As the two young elves sit at fire side an odd friendship is formed, the timid girl moves closer to the dark elf as the night progresses.  Morning comes and the two must say their good byes as it is again safe to travel.  Trying to show his disappointment at the farewells Halcion remains stone faced and calm.  The wood elf slips into the forest quietly, sighing Halcion turns to walk away.  He feels a rush behind him as Sara grabs him and gives him a quick kiss before she is off again.  Disappearing into the air around him a soft smile crosses his face for a second.
<br />

<br />
	As Halcion grows in age, his power grows with him.  Coming into his own it is apparent he is neither a normal dark elf nor a normal enchanter.  His power and his wisdom are well beyond his years, his discipline and control is wondrous.  Of course being a dark elf in this world isn’t very easy, as he has found himself both outcast from good and evil. 
<br />

<br />
	 As Halcion journeys into the heart of the Dread lands, he tries to bite back the cold as his cloak whips around him in a frenzy. Covered by his veil of magic he trudges through the mountain tops of snow, finally reaching the edge and seeing out in the forest.  “Not to far from here lies a castle, a dangerous one at that.” He thinks to himself quietly.  Deciding to set up camp for the night he finds a cave and begins to collect wood for a fire.  He finds his thoughts drifting to the elf that stole his heart the months before, her soft golden hair and wondrous blue eyes.  “At least she could start a fire.” He grumbles as he fiddles with the flint and steel in his pack.  He lies back against the cool wall of the cave and starts to drift off into his dreams; a noise awakens him from his state.  Foot steps are heard outside his cave that he had hidden with a clever illusion.  A strange glow begins to move its way into his cave as his illusion waves and falters.  A pair of shadowed figures walks into the cave, shielding his eyes from the now steadily glowing light; Halcion gets to his feet and prepares to defend himself against robbers.  His hands glow with furious light as he begins to recall the little offensive magic he knew.  “Calm down there little one, no one is going to hurt you, right dear?” a female elfs voices smirked.  Halcion’s fist dimmed as he heard a familiar voice.  “Not if he doesn’t calm down before he blows a hole in the wall.” Xornn chuckled.  “You mind turning down the lights a bit; you’re giving me a head ache.” Halcion said as he winced against the light.  The wood elf besides Xornn, slipped a light stone back into her pouch, dimming the cave to just the embers of the fire. “Some of us don’t have your keen eyesight in the dark.” Muttered the wood elf.  “Well I see you brought a friend sire, care to introduce us or am I the only gentleman in the room?” Halcion chuckled as he winked to Xornn.  Taking the young ladies hand into his he kisses it and offers his introduction. “Hello there m’lady, my name is Halcion, apprentice to Master Xornn here.”  “My name is Rhedd, I’m surprised you have never heard about me before.” She replies turning an icy glare to Xornn.  “Halcion, meet my wife.”  Halcion’s jaw dropped to the floor at this news, he had thought of Xornn more as a teacher and not so much as a person in his life.  
<br />

<br />
	The three sat well into the night talking about old times and new ones to come, Rhedd soon mentioned that she had come across a young wood elf in her travels.  Talking to this lonely girl she had soon discovered the reason for her sadness, she missed someone she had grown very close to in such a short period of time, her name was Sarania.  Thoughts and feelings began rushing back into Halcion’s mind as her name was mentioned, it seemed to carry itself with the wind to find him again, to let him know she was thinking of him as well.  “What brings you to this part of the world sire?” queried the dark elf.  “A staff, one of untold legends and great powers.  I’ve been working on recovering it since I came across some old scrolls, I seem to have misplaced them, no bother I had made copies for myself.” Explained Xornn.  Halcion’s face turned a bright red at the mention of the scrolls.  He drew a few tattered notes from his pack.  Grinning slyly he handed them to Xornn.  “Why you little rogue, how did you get a hold of these?”  “You dropped them last time we met and you took off so fast I had no time to catch you.” Said Halcion.  “I’ve studied the notes long and hard myself, I think I’ve found something.” Halcion said as he motioned to Xornn.  The two enchanters fussed and argued over the notes and fine subjects of each others journals and studies.  “You two have fun, I’m going to see if I can stir up some fun.” Rhedd smirked as she wandered out of the cave.
<br />

<br />
	Early the next morning Halcion rose early to start his day, he soon found himself with the lack of his companions.  Searching around he found a short note, explaining to him that Xornn and Rhedd had be called away in the night on urgent business.  A bit disappointed Halcion sulked about working his day’s chores.  Cleaning up his camp, his mind made.  He was to leave the Dread lands tonight in search of something, unsure of what he was looking for but certain it was not here.  Stuffing his mountain clothes into his pack, he gathers the rest of his items and sets off through the deserted waste lands.  Cloaking his image from harm doing, he fades into his surroundings as he presses forth.  As he scrambles past a nest of large spiders he spies some columns and an opening in the side of the mountain.  He draws a map from his pack and inspects it quickly before sliding it back in.  “So this is the way to Firiona Vie, I expected more from those snobby high elves.” He mutters as he starts his trek into the pathway embedded in the mountains. 
<br />

<br />
	 Making his way through the tunnel he spots on of the cities guards, Halcion unsure of what path to take inside of the tunnel decides to ask.  He steps up behind the guard and begans to speak.  The guard whirls quickly about as his face contorts with anger he shouts “You Dark elves have ruined your own lands! You will not ruin mine!”  Halcion freezes for a moment unsure of what do to, soon his eyes begin to glow wildly as a look of confusion washes over the face of the guard.  Halcion chuckles as the guard stands there mesmerized unable to do anything.  With a glow Halcion’s form shimmers into that of a handsome high elf.  A wave of his hand makes the guard forget all about what just happened as Halcion sent him on his way.  “Some people just can’t look past some ones race I guess, sad world when people don’t give you a chance just because of what you look like.” He thinks quietly to himself.  As he steps out of the dark cave he shields his eyes from the mid-day sun.  His vision washes over the view of Firiona Vie, a beautiful city surrounded by crystal clear waters.
<br />

<br />
	He quietly steps into the city, keeping in mind to hold his illusion steady, the rest of the guards may not be so easy to subdue.  Working his way through the crowds he finds the bank and unloads some trinkets he has collected.  He then find himself drifting towards a nice bar as he settles in one of the deep chairs he orders a drink, his thoughts begin to wander.  His mind fills with the thoughts around him, not trying to intrude but hes always been able to peer into others thoughts. An image flashes into his mind, Sara, some things wrong.  He holds still for a moment, trying to find the person the image flowed from.  His eyes gazing around the room, they settle upon a ragged group of men.  His eyes close in on a single member of the party, one particular ragged man.  He closes his eyes and focuses on the images swirling around.   His thoughts cluttered with images of the days battle and the nobles throat he slit earlier for five platinum.  He opens his eyes, only to find the ragged stranger looking back at him.  His cold eyes glaring at Halcion.  He watches as the man fiddles with a small pendent hanging from his neck.  It glows a soft blue in the dark room.  “s**t.”  Halcion thinks, knowing he was careless enough to not make an attempt to cover up his magic.  The bearer of the pendent and his crew get up from their seats, knocking the chairs and table over as they trudge over to wear Halcion is sitting. “What the hell do you think your doing, you damn inky?”  The stranger begins to draw a dagger from a sheath in his wrist.  The young elf stands up as his illusion drops and reveals his true self; a gasp arises from the small crowd in the dinning room.  He grins devilishly as he rolls a copper piece between his fingers, in a small flash of light and clattering of change on the floor he is gone. The bewildered crew looks around for the elf.  The ragged stranger clutching the pendant around his neck looks about.  Seeing nothing the men stumble out of the dinning room to find their next fight.

	No one notices the small copper piece on the floor, right itself and start rolling through the kitchen door.  Passing by the kitchen servant’s feet and out the back door, the coin grows and contorts into unusual shapes as Halcion stretches his sore limbs.  “Not a bad little trick there darling.” A young human female says as she adjusts the straps on her thin leather boots.  Startled Halcion carefully surveys the young woman, noting her tattoos and her curious attire, no loose clothing, tight leather breaches and tunic, as well as wraps around her fists as he takes her in.  “What concern do you have in my affairs lady monk?” Queried Halcion.  “You seem like an interesting fellow, you know being cooped up in The Order so long can get a bit boring.  Now that I am allowed to travel certain things interest me, you are one of them.” The woman replied.  Unsettled, Halcion thinks of his next move, what was happening to Sara, what could he do to help and what did he have to do to find her.  “I can tell you’re looking for someone aren’t you?” she chimed in.  “That’s my own affair not yours dear lady, no if you excuse me I must be going before these town folks find dark elven blood in their midst.”  With that said Halcion waved his hand and his form shimmers as he takes on the features of a young human male. 
<br />
	
<br />
	“You know they’re going to find you like that.” Remarked the monk, who had started following Halcion.  Grumbling he turns to her, “And what do you know of magic of this sorts?”  “I know that people know you are here, they are gathering their own tools to help them see magic.  Like that thug in the bar.”  “Ok and what do you suppose I do about it?” the clearly annoyed Halcion muttered.  “If you follow me…” “Follow you? Are you crazy?  I’ve just met you, I don’t know your name I don’t know where you’re from, and I don’t know anything about you!” Halcion interrupted.  Halcion turns as he hears the shouts of guards bellow out over the crisp night air.  “Kaila, Freeport and you know I am a monk.”  She blurts out.   “Huh?” Halcion manages to blurt out.  “My name, where I am from and what you know about me.  Now if you don’t follow me now you’re going to make a nice impression on the gallows!”  She reaches her hand out.  Halcion turns towards the sound of clattering metal headed in his direction, Kaila reaches over and clasps a firm grasp on his forearm pulling him quickly into a small alley he had not seen before.  Halcion blushes deeply as he realizes how close he is to Kaila.  “A bit cramped in here don’t you think?” Halcion manages to say as he tries not to stare at her.  She places a hand over his mouth.  “There are places in this city and others that are safe spots for rogues, I’m lucky to have a few friends on the other side of the law that let me know about these.  While the magic conceals our image it will not conceal your loud mouth, so shush.” She whispers. The pair lay still, silent for a few minutes before Kaila leads him out of the dark alley.
<br />

<br />
	“Now I suggest you stick with me or else you’re in a heap of trouble darling.” She grinned at him.  Halcion nodded at the young girl and followed her through the many twists and turns of a small labyrinth under the city she had taken him too.  Sloshing through the muck and mess down there, Halcion holds his nose and quietly wonders to himself how he got dragged into this.  As they turn down a corridor they see a solid brick wall in their path.  “Wrong turn?” chuckled Halcion trying to sound amused at the situation.   Shooting a glare at the dark elf, Kaila turns towards the wall and knocks four times, pauses, then knocks once again.  A small slot opens up in the door and a pair of eyes looks out onto the unlikely pair.  A voice behind the door grumbles, “Still bringing back strays I see, Kaila.”  “Well don’t just stand there Gus, open up the damn door.”  The wall of bricks shimmers and is replaced by a large iron door that creaks and squeals as it moves on its ancient hinges.
<br />

<br />
	She steps through the doorway and into the dimly lit room, many shady characters are playing cards, darts and making cat calls at the lady performers on stage.  Halcion takes a few steps into the room, it develops a strange silence as the many pairs of eyes in the room all set upon him.  Shifting uneasily Halcion wonders if this was a good idea or not.  “What are you mongrels looking at?” Kaila shot at the crowded room.  The men, knowing the young monks fiery temper decide its better to go about their business.  Relieved at the thought of not having to exhaust him-self teaching all these ruffians a lesson, Halcion follows Kaila into a corner of the basement room and settles down in a large padded leather chair.  He relaxes and lets his sense roam.  He smells the cigar smoke in the air, the scent of meat and fresh bread cooking in the oven.  His keen eyesight searches over the crowd of faces for nothing in particular, his sensitive ears trying to not ease drop on conversations about bragging paladins and trolls who were easily outwitted.  He awakes from his small trance like state as Kaila kicks his shin, “Ow!” Halcion jumps from surprise.  “Do you always ignore someone when they are talking to you?” Kaila asks abruptly.  “Sorry, was just taking in the surroundings.  Reminds me a lot of a place back in Neriak, called the Maiden’s Fancy.”  “As I was saying…We will stay here for a few days until the guards are sure of your absence from the city.  I have already made arrangements for a room to stay in, but its coming out of your pocket.”  She informs him.  
<br />
“Now tell me, who are you looking for?” 
<br />

<br />
	 Halcion sighs but decides to comply with her request and begins his tale of the young elf who stole his heart.  “You know we are going to need more help finding this girl than just you and I.”  Kaila’s voice sounding distant in the smoke filled air.  “Tomorrow we will look for an adventure, tonight, we sleep.” She yawns as she stands.  She begins to walk down a hallway leading from the common area.  She glances back and sees Halcion standing there. “Well come on, we have a lot of work to do tomorrow and you won’t be any help if you don’t get some rest.”  He trudges down the hall and follows her into the room; he looks about and notices the single bed in the room.  An uneasy look settles across his face.  Chuckling Kaila looks at the elf, “Don’t worry, you’ll sleep in the bed.  I have my own bedding I use.”  With that she draws a hammock out of her light pack and sets it up using hooks hanging on the walls.  She swings into the hammock and quickly falls fast asleep.  Shrugging off his heavy robe, Halcion hops into the bed and pulls the covers around him.
<br />

<br />
	He sleeps but its not a restful sleep, nightmares toss on turn him.  Visions of his beloved Sara being destroyed tear through his head.  Halcion wakes abruptly, a profuse sweat running down his body.  Looking about he sees no sign of Kaila, he sits up and jumps out of bed. His eyes scanning the room until he sees a door just slightly ajar on the other side of the room. He throws his robe on and bursts through the door searching for her. His eyes meet hers as she washes herself off in the big tub filled with hot steaming water.  His jaw drops seeing her like this then he turns his gaze quickly and begins to wholly apologize to her.  She chuckles at the blushing elf as she steps from the tub.  “Hand me that towel will you darling?”  He reaches for the towel and puts his hand out behind his back, careful not to turn around.  She dries off then drops the towel to the floor as she walks into the main room to put her tunic and breeches on.  Halcion turns a deep purple as he manages to say “Didn’t anyone ever teach you humility?”  “When growing up in The Order, everyone is treated the same, we are all equals and the sex of the student is not made an issue.  Everyone sleeps in the same barracks, everyone eats in the same mess and everyone uses the same bath house.” She informs him.  Now enough chit-chat, you better use that bath now or you probably won’t get one while we are on the road.”  Halcion shooed her out of the room, unlike her, he enjoyed his privacy.
<br />

<br />
	After his bath he puts on his breeches and forgoes his robe for the moment but instead puts on a simple leather tunic.  He steps out into the common room to find it much quieter than the night before.  Kaila sits at a table eating a breakfast of honey, oatmeal and muffins.  He sits down and joins her, helping him-self to the pitcher of milk at the table.  They eat quietly, either of them clearly not morning people.  Afterwards Kaila gets up and heads up a flight of stairs and opens a door into an open courtyard.  Halcion follows her out, shielding his eyes from the morning sun as it beats down on the courtyard.  He watches as she begins to stretch for her morning work out.  She takes a stance and begins to slowly move herself in a complex exercise.  Her body picking up speed and force with each new maneuver, twisting and lunging.  Her wrapped fists whipping through the morning air becoming a blur of pure speed and power.  Halcion’s jaw drops as he watches her in awe. Her muscles rippling and flowing smooth as she continues her exercise.  She stops and picks up a towel wiping the sweat from her brow as she takes a drink.  She grins evilly at Halcion.
<br />
“Now its your turn Halc.”  Halcion laughs at her proposal, he was in good shape but he had no where near the skill it took for something like that.  She runs over to him and grabs him by the wrist, twisting it and easily tossing the elf over her shoulder and out into the middle of the courtyard. “Hey now!” Halcion complains as he rubs his sore muscles.  “Now what if we had been out on the road, someone could have easily done just what I did to you as well, except after you had fallen they may have placed a knife in your chest.  Now get up your going to learn some self defense.”  
<br />

<br />
	“I’d like to see you try that again Kaila.”  Halcion says as he eyes start glowing with a violet fury.  She reaches for him but with a flash of violet she can no longer see.  Halcion chuckles as he walks around the blind Kaila, making faces at her.  Deftly the young girl takes Halcion’s feet from beneath him with a swift sweep kick.  Her sight returns as Halcion loses his concentration.  “You may have taken my sight, but I still have other sense to work with.  And you walk about as quiet as a Clydesdale.”
