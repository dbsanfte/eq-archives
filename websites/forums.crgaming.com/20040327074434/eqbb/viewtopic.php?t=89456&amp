<br />
Quein Looked over at her compainion , he was asleep by the camp fire, his wood elven features shadowed in the darkness.Quein on the other hand couldnt sleep she kept seeing things she didnt care to see again.She closed her eyes and was asleep in moments.
<br />
      Quein was standing in a open  breezy feild not far from the Campinieinc camp. The breeze blowed her long black hair about her face.
<br />
She turned when a twig broke not far from where she stood.Daillen was trying to sneak up on her.She smiled in spite of herself and whent to him.
<br />
     "Stil trying to play these childs games?" She grinned 
<br />
    "No, just wanted to surprise you.Errr... got to boring in camp, tomany fights i didnt want to get into ."He said that his nut brown cheeks blushing lightly as a small taft of his mud brown hair blew into his face.
<br />
     "Then why are you blushing?" Quein asked him.
<br />
    "Errrr.. Welll... i... i... wanted to come be with you actully."He wrapped his arms about her.
<br />
     She and Daillen had been good friends since the age of 5, and here he was gettin romantic? She cared for Daillen more of a brother then a lover.Ahh o well why blow him off? might as well see if this is anter prank. Quein frowned , her thoughts ceased.
<br />
     "Anything the matter ,Quein?"
<br />
     "uhhh, no, not at the moment." She looked at him.
<br />
     Daillen did something totally unaspected, he bent and kissed her passonatly.When he finally backed away he was staring at her, and her at him.
<br />
     "Daillen, i think im ganna go back to camp."She turned and took at step"By the way.... how long have you felt that way?" She touched her lips.
<br />
     He was blushing"Let me escort you back." he moved to her side, ignoring her other question.They went back to camp,
<br />
   Hours later it happened... Winged Basilisk camp from no where distroying the people of the camp with their peterfiying stare of with the flames of hell they breathed.Daillen grabbed Quein and ran to the woods none channlenged them. they both looked back at the ruined camp of the druids... if they were the only that escaped their were over 200 dead.
<br />
  Quein awoke breathing hard, why did she have to fall asleep?! She noticed she was bein held. Daillen had his arms around her concern shown in his face.
<br />
     "you okay Que?" he asked.
<br />
    "yes i am." she hugged him digging her head into his shoulders, tears forming rivers on her face.
<br />
     Daillen looked at her when she finally awoke. her black eyes staring at him, his own sky blue eyes looked at her. He kissed her then. He loved her more then life it self.
<br />

<br />
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<br />
       "Well is it done?" A cold harsh voice that chilled all those who heard it to te bone and soul.
<br />
      "For the most part ,Sir." a scared dark elf messanger muttered.
<br />
     "What do you mean by for the most part?!"the voice boomed angerly.
<br />
      "2 Druids escaped , Master."
<br />
      "Go on. Who?" 
<br />
      "A male and a  female wood elf, all i know is the female is named Quein , and the male is named Daillen."
<br />
      "Fools... Fools! HOW DARE YOU FAIL ME!"The Voice Howled "Bring me the girls head or burn in HELL!" Innuruk boomed.
<br />
      "Yes, my Master, as you wish." The dark elf ran from the god of hates chambers , to give the God of hates message.
<br />

<br />
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<br />
      "Where to?" Daillen asked Quein.The dawns light spilling over them.
<br />
     " Kelethan for some suplise then as far north as we can go!i dont want to endanger others if those things hunt us again!"Quein said, She found her love for Daillen changing.She no longer loved him as a brother but as a lover, it had only taken 2 days fr her to change.
<br />
      The two trudged onward not certain where they were.The camp itself was in the Waking lands, but now they were in Snowy tarain , lost. They came across a large casam. 
<br />
     "Shall we go in and up? prolly our only way through."Daillen sugested.
<br />
     "Aye." Quein muttered as they started to climb down the side, the foo holds were plenty and they got down easily.
<br />
    It took them a good part of 3 days to get through to Cobolt scar , they finally figured out where they were."No way outta' here really." Daillen muttered, chilled and freezing from the tunnle they were in.
<br />
        "yah it seem so." Quein leaned into Daillen for some warmth.A little later they found themselve in a lovers dance un concerned of where they were anymore.Daillen was on top of her their clothing shed not far from where they lay. after they were done they chill got to them. How do they get out?! the thought crossed both their minds.They finally disided swimming was the best. they dove in the water and swam to shore which they found not far from them. they warmned up at the offmir camps. a high elf wizard approached them.
<br />
    "You two dont look so well. I can Teleport you outta here if you let me come on your journeys.This has been my home for 7 long years and i dont know what else to do." he muttered eyeing Quein.
<br />
     "fine we want out of here as much as you do."Daillen muttered not following the elfs gaze that went up and down Queins body.
<br />
     The wizard ported them out of there.They camped in Greater faydark where they wished to be ported too.Daillen went off to the elf city to get suplise leavin Quein and the high elf.
<br />
    "My names Kainien" he smiled placing his hand on hers.She pulled it away.Kainien frowned.
<br />
     "I am Quein"she muttered.Kainien moved closer to her wrapping his arm tightly around her."Do you have a problem Kainien?" she snapped.
<br />
     "No, milady." He removed his arm and went into the wood.
<br />
     Some nerve! Quein thought. moments later all went black. When she awoke she was in a tunnle of some sort and kainein was cleaning a head wound.
<br />
      Quein tried to speak but she was bound and gagged.Kaiien Grinned in spite of himself and stroked her face."il un-gag you if u promise you wont scream.She nodded. he removed he gag. and moved close to her , strocking her face abd body freely.
<br />
      "What are you doing?" she asked him, his hands under her shirt and she couldnt do a thing about it bein bound as she was."Un tie me!"
<br />
     "No." he muttered Climbing on top of her."I fell in love with you the moment i set eyes on you."He grabbed her face and kissed her and kept kissing her. 
<br />
     She growled as he removed her clothing and then his own."Why are you doin this?!" 
<br />
    "To make you mine!" He grinned"I saw the love you have for the other druid. ill kill him unless  corperate." 
<br />
    She looked away a tear faling  down her face, she didn care if the high elf raped her. she just wanted free. 
<br />
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<br />
  
<br />
       Daillen looked about for the High elf and Quein, they were both gone from where he left them. he called their names and asked everyone he could if he saw either. all the anwsers were no. He sat and waited nothing. he worried greatly , Quein!
<br />
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<br />

<br />
  "Ill kill you if you dont let me go!" Quein howled
<br />
  "How will you?" Kainein demaned kissing her hard.
<br />
  "ill find a way!" She snarled" What will you do if Daillen tracks  you here?"
<br />
  "He cant i covered all signs of tracks before i started and if he dose he'l die." The high elf grinned his hands running down her naked body."You dont seem to care if i do this " he smiled"Come with me"
<br />
   "No" her anwser ws firm"I would never go with you" 
<br />
   The Elf grinned"then il make you see it my way, Come with me or ill kill your friend you wouldnt want that would you?"
<br />
  "Of course not!" She howled. 
<br />
    He was on top of her again doing what ever he pleased.
<br />
   He Grabbed her face so she looked at him"As i said i fell in love with you the mment i saw you. You want out you shouldnt have been so god damned beautiful!" He kissed her long enough to sufficate her.
<br />
   " I hate you!" She howled "Set me free!" Her feet were free she relisec and kicked him hard. he backed away stunned. She freed hersel and got into her clothing, without  a moments look back she ran into the night.
<br />
   
<br />

				<td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">Tears streaked Quein's face as she ran, she ran for who knows how long, several thoughts crossing her mind such as, Why me?! Why! Do the gods hate me so?!She ignored the burning pain in her legs and sides she kept running until she colapsed from exhuasten,Tears continuied to roll down her cheeks.
<br />
   Why was she cursed so?She finally caught her breath and regained her composisure, she couldnt have changed what happened she was bound and gagged most of that time. She walked into a beautiful grove she had played in as a child, bringing back good and bad memories.She loved this Grove; it gave her pleasure, being here, she rembered the Phoenix Wolf cub Heahian; She and Daillen had played with the orphained cub, they always snuck food and water and other necisitys the puppy needed.the puppy , Heahian, was their most loyal friend.
<br />
   She smiled at the thought she loved that thought, she looked into the pool of water.seeing the wolf cubs young face, then Daillen's she rembered how life was before this choas.
<br />
    :Daillen smiled at her from one of the great oaks, he sat under,calling her over.
<br />
     "have you seen Heahian?"
<br />
    "Are you two playing hide and seek again?"
<br />
    "Aye he didnt leave a trace, he's gotten good."
<br />
   "You two are so silly."
<br />
     "Gotcha!" a Elfish looking creature,with Grayish skin Silver Hair, Wolf tails , and ears and a big wolfish grin.
<br />
    "Heahian!" Quein Yelping in surpirse hugging the Elf-wolf.
<br />
   "No, i Gotcha!" Daillen laughed as he tickled the elf-wolf till he begged for mercy.
<br />
     "That wasnt fun Daillen!"
<br />
     "Then why were you laughing?"Daillen Tuanted back.
<br />
     "Calm down you two"Quein threw water on them , and they all dove in for a swim.:
<br />
     Thoughs were the days.Neary by bushes waved and sounded the approach of something, Quein was on her feet scaning the dark forest uncertanily.
<br />
     ---Quein; why are you here alone?---
<br />
   She turned to  look, at who spoke.A hadsome Silver wolf stood about 5 feet behind her. she reconised him at once.
<br />
    "Heahian!"she threw her arms around the wolf's neck."Your season of the wolf is it?"
<br />
   --- Aye it is, it will end when the moon hits its peek this night. Why are you here alone? i saw you crying, Did Daillen hurt you?---
<br />
   "No he didnt... i... i... was.... i was....." She choaked on the words single tears falling from her eyes."I was raped.." she muttered.
<br />
   -- Bye whom?--- Heahian Snarled.
<br />
  "A High elf, i dont rember his name, if he did tell me."She rubbed her forehead.
<br />
  --- Stay here dont move, By the way, is Daillen here he might want to comfort you.---
<br />
  "He is somewhere he left me and the elf alone to go get suplise, i cant belive we trusted him." 
<br />
    --- its Alright, ill be back before the moon hits its peak.--- Heahian disapeared in a cloud of mist.
<br />
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<br />
   Daillen yawned, and looked about for Quein or the high elf. He saw a bright robed figure approach.
<br />
    "Wheres Quein?!" he snarled at the elf.
<br />
   " I have no clue, i stepped away from her to give her some space, and she was gone when i returned ive been scanning this area for her."
<br />
    "What is your name elf?" Daillen Snarled un trustingly.
<br />
   "I am called Kainien" he bowed. 
<br />
     "Do you know where Quein is? tell me!"
<br />
   "no i do not." 
<br />
    "well lets look." 
<br />
    Daillen lead the way through the woods glacing around for his beloved Quein.he looked back at the high elf every now and then, he didnt trust what Kainien , was telling him. Mist in circled the two, silvery shadows enclosed them. They Felt as if they were bein watched an errire voice called:  
<br />
      ---- Daillen--
<br />
    "Who's there?" Kainien called un easyly.
<br />
   --- And who might you be? high elf.?---
<br />
   A silver shadow approached them, it took the shape of a wolf , which daillen reconized as Heahian.
<br />
     Heahain, was Snarling teeth bared at Kainien.  
<br />
    "Daillen What is this Wolf's Problem?!" Kainien Howled in fear.
<br />
    "He dosent like you."Daillen looked from the elf to the wolf"Thats the matter Heahian?" 
<br />
      --- I found Quein she wants to talk to you.--- Daillen Grinned and a Evil smile crossed Kainien's face--- im taking you to her alone i dont like this high elf.--- 
<br />
    "But but... why not? im as worried about Quein as he is!" Kainien howled in a sincere furry.
<br />
    "If we both watch him it should be fine." Daillen muttered.
<br />
     Heahian nodded and turned to leave --- you two better keep up.---
<br />
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<br />
    Quein sighed and looked at the pile of soil in her hand.She let it blow in a gentle breeze. She thought of what had happened with her and the high elf earlery. Had she realy done all she could to stop it? Had she? What if she actully enjoyed being raped. her brow furrowed , she had done everyhting she could have she knew. she loved Daillen , not him, she would never love that high elf monster.She picked up anther handful of soil and threw it into a near by bush.
<br />
   --- what was that for Quein?--- Heahian muttered brushing his muzzel with his paw.
<br />
   "heh sorry." 
<br />
   --- Daillen is here, theres a high elf with him i want to know if thats the 1 that attacked you, come and stay hidden.--- 
<br />
  he lead her into the bushes where Daillen and Kainien came into veiw. She bent and whispered into Heahian's senitive ear.
<br />
   "yes, that is him." She had a worried look on her face, she was concered about Daillen.
<br />
   --- You fell i love with Daillen Didnt you?---
<br />
   She looked at the wolf and nodded surprised by his question. Heahian Licked her cheek --- Well lets get this over with.-- They went into the clearing.
<br />
      Kainien smiled and she came into veiw, she never met his gaze. "Daillen" she whispered 
<br />
     Daillen ran up to her and hugged her.Quein looked at Heahian and winked.She hugged Daillen back crying into her shoulder.
<br />
   Heahian Snarled and Growled deeply. The lovers broke their hug and looked. he was Snarling at Kainien. the high elf had true fear in his eyes, as he turned to the wood elves for help.
<br />
    --- you wont get away elf.--- Heahian's growl was deep and fierce.
<br />
   "With what?!" Kainien backed away slowly "I didnt do anything." he lied.
<br />
   ---You hurt Quein , i smelt it on her and you, im  not going to let you get away with it.--- 
<br />
    "What did you do to her?" Daillen muttered.
<br />
   " Nothing i swear! i just borrowed these robes from my older brother!" Kainien's fear was true."i was with my mother and sister after i left Quein to herself!"
<br />
     "how much dose your brother look like you?" Quein asked suddenly, startling both Haehian and Daillen.
<br />
     "Extically the same exspect a scar on is left cheek he got when we were childeren.
<br />
     She rembered the high elf's face tht attacked her, he had a thin almost invisiable scar on his cheek.She apprached, Kainien wearily. The moonlight hit the left side of the elf's face. the same scar he discrided was clearly visable. She jumped back from him fear mirrowed in her eyes.Haehian Jumped the elf and tore him to peices, all that was left was little blood and the robes. when he was done... but Haehian didn't kill him the elf simply disapeared.
<br />
    Midnight struck and Haehian became the elf-wolf , again. He had grown very handsome, and he sat and talked with Daillen and glacing at Quein, when their conversation was based on her, they left her to herself mostly.  
<br />
      "So you've Grown, fond of  her have you Haeh? Daillen asked 
<br />
    "Aye i have."
<br />
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<br />
     A young High elf man approached his master.
<br />
   "You have done well Kainien." innuruk muttered." Are you sure you have done this?
<br />
   "Yes my master, i have done as you have asked."
<br />

<br />

     "Can you be certain, Kainien did his job."
<br />
    "yes master but he let the girl get away , so we arent certain his purpose was fully; well fulfilled."
<br />
    "I see keep spying on her and her friends."

    "yes, Master." The Spy disapeared into the castle.
<br />
    Inneruk, was happy with himself, if that girl found her true power she could destroy all evil if she is killed before that, she wont be much of a nuisence.he Laughed evilly at his plot, his many servants ran form his chambers in Fear.
<br />
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<br />

<br />
      Quein's eye's fluttered open.She saw no sign of Daillen but noticed Heahian laying next to her his Gray skin seemed t have a silver glow like his hair, she almost wanted to stroke him.
<br />
    The elf-wolf's eyes opened and looked at her his gray-blues eyes filled with a un-readable warm expression. He smiled and brushed the hair out of her face, before rising to his feet gracefully.
<br />
   She smiled back, and hugged him.
<br />
   "This dosent feel, right. Where is Daillen?"
<br />
   "whats the matter? I dont know he went out early this morning." His arms were around her and his face was close to her own.
<br />
   "Nothing." She looked away resting her head on his chest.
<br />
   "Theres something the matter." his face was agianst hers." I can sence it. you dont like me this close to you. because u love Daillen..."
<br />
   She looked up at him and smiled tears running down her face.he whiped them away quickly.
<br />
   "i do love him. and i love you too , but ... my love for you guys is more of a brotherly love then anything."
<br />
    "i see." Heahian muttered." You dont act like you are just a sister figure to Daillen, you act as if your his girlfriend." He bent and kissed her. he backed away quickly and disapeared into the mist.
<br />
    Quein stared after him.
<br />
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<br />
     Kainien smiled as he watched Quein from  a distance. He loved her even if he was under Innruks comand.He would ask the God of hate if he could have her. if sheindeed carried his child, he would make certain of it. The Druidic Child of Evil. that was Innuruks plot. he wanted a druid more powerful then even the storm  wardens to become his loyal servant. Kainien didnt care. All he wanted was Quein.  He got jeolious when her companions tried to sueduss her. but he didnt move from his spot. he watched the wolf-elf go into the shadows. just to have his love for the druid to get thrown back in his face he felt sorry for him.
<br />
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<br />
    Heahian punched a near by tree. Was she Lieing?! Why couldnt she love him the way he loved her. he knew she might be pregnant ; he would protect her, he would protect her child even if she was raped. he knew she wouldnt care if the child was a product of a rape she would love it.Heahian  looked back at where Quein was standin her confusion was growing. he sighed.
<br />
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<br />
    Quein watched the shadows in which Heahian hide. She never questioned her feeling about him. she was so confused.She sat and looked into the water of the grove. What would befallen them? she asked and then began to rember more happy times. her and Daillen in the Colbolt tunnle, Her and heahian moments ealiry  The there as childeren.  She loved both more then brothers... but she couldnt choose.

<br />
   "Vinnie, its been a Long time, since we've been together hasnt it my love?'
<br />
    "Oh my ,Daillen!" The beautiful dark elf threw er arms around him, her Silver hair blinding him for a moment.
<br />
    "What have you been up to?" Daillen asked her stroking the dark elf's hair.  
<br />
     "Nothing just the ushale, ive missed you my love." Vinnie kissed Daillen for a minute.
<br />
     "I just came for suplise, i need to go out again." 
<br />
     "Just come in for a bit."
<br />
    "Alright."  Daillen followed her into their home.
<br />
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<br />
     Heahian Tapped Quein's shoulder awakening her.
<br />
    "Huh? What? O hi Heah." Quein muttered hugging him.
<br />
    "We should find Daillen i  found his sent trail about a hour ago."
<br />
    "Why did you wake me?"
<br />
    "You looked so peaceful sleeping." She stood and followed him.
<br />
    She walked by his side, he put his arm around her ."There's something i should tell you before we go to Daillen."
<br />
     "What is it?" She looked up at him, as they stopped walking.
<br />
    " I promised id never tell him. But he has a Wife, he's Married to a Dark elf, " he bent close." i dont want him to hurt you. I dont know if they have any children , but they live right out of Kelethen and south of Felewith in the middle of the wood. To keep her safe."
<br />
     Quein put her head on his shoulder, and cried softly."How long have you known?"
<br />
     "Since that night , when we talked to each other he told me about his wife."
<br />
      "Why didnt he tell me?"
<br />
      "He love's you but i dont think he cares as much about his wife as he dose you. Stay away from him."
<br />
       "Heahian thank you. we can go see him now."
<br />
       She sighed and silent tears ran down her face, she was happy that Heahian cared enough about her to tell the truth.How much was Daillen hiding from her? Was he with the emeny that seeked them? Oh, Daillen. 
<br />
      The walked into the gloomy part of te forest keeping their cloaks wrapped about them to keep from the chill. A small cottege stoof not 15 feet into a clearing the gardens beautifully tended. the Door open and Heahian and Quein sharnk into the shadows . Daillen with his arm around a Dark elf woman with yellow eyes and Long silver hair.
<br />
      "Let me come with you this time my love!" She said tears falling from her eyes.
<br />
      "No, Vinnie. It's too dangerus, i will be back as soon as i can."
<br />
      "But Daillen!, I'm a Cleric! i can keep you and your friends alive."
<br />
      " I said No, Vinnie."
<br />
       Heahian Shifted in the shadows next to Quein. he whispered in her ear." this is good as any time to itterupt them. Stay here." he slid from the shadows. 
<br />
     "Actully a Cleric would help on our adventures, Why not let her come Daillen?"
<br />
     "Heahian! how long have you been there?" Daillen Snarled.
<br />
     "Long enough." Heahian Frowned and stifled the urge to look at Quein."Why not let your wife come. Or do you think you can keep going between her and Quein?"
<br />
      "Who's Quein , Daillen?" Vinnie muttered sadly.
<br />
      " A old Childhood friend dont worry she means nothing to me." Daillen said loud enough for Heahian to hear.
<br />
     "Maybe i  should go tell her that? o wait i think you already did!" Heahian Snarled. he looked at Quein and nodded.She came out to stand next to him.
<br />
     "Quein..." Daillen muttered staring at her.
<br />
    "So she;s whats this is about! Daillen i hate you!" Vinnie said smacking him.
<br />
       "Vinnie! Like i said she means nothing to me! Your the only one i care about!" Daillen sighed "Alright you can come with us." 
<br />
       "Really?" Vinnie Grinned she knew well enough how Daillen's head worked.
<br />
        Quein Stared at the Husband and wife before she looked at Heahian, his mouth was gaping.She hugged him before she clutched her stomache and fell to her knee's. She vomited then, then again.
<br />
        Heahian knelt besides her and put his arms around her."I will always protect you." his arms tightened about her body"I see that your sickness isnt cause by a bug but by this." he touched her stomache gently.
<br />
    She smiled and kissed his cheek.

To get the Tainted Essence for the child.It would be simple enough to get. just go to the Plane of hate and kill 1 of the guards. he grinned. it would be nice to kill again.
<br />
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^    It was Several months after the company left the Faydark forests. Heahian held Quein in his arms as she held her newborn child. The child Slept soundly and did his mother  Heahian just watched them. He looked at Vinnie who was sippin Tea and Enjoying the ship ride to Fironia Vie. Daillen was probly on deck; his Sea Sickness was obvious. Quein stirred he black eyes looked at Heahian she smiled and kissed him. 
<br />
     "We need to think of a name for this 1." She tickled the child's chin. the kid awoke and giggled histerically.Quein and Heahian Giggled too.
<br />
      "We should shouldnt we."
<br />
     "i wouldnt." Vinnie Startled them." If i was innuruk i would send someone to kill my worst  emeny or do something to them.If that High Elf raped you for a reason it would be to get you pregnant, Maybe Innuruk has a plot for your Child. and he wants to kill you ,Quein. If you want the name the child be my guest but i would sooner drop that kid in the sea than that." Vinnie Walked out on deck. Quein and Heahian stared after her.
<br />
    "She knows more than  1 mans mind. maybe she's telling us something. Lets wait to name him." heahain said as he Kissed her.
<br />
 She kissed him back." I love you Heahian."
<br />
    he smiled at her.

Quein's grip about his arm and child tightened.... not far in front of them stood Kainien he was grinning evilly. Heahian Snarled and whispered in her ear. "We need to hurry ; this is the night of the wolf for me after midnight i will be a wolf again... lets just pass him up." They continued walking pass the high elf who was startled what they just did. 
<br />
   "ill let the Dranchids get them if not ill kill them before they reach their companions... Sweet Sweet revenge Daillen... He Grinned. Kainien dawned his cloack and followed the couple he thought was Daillen and Quein.
<br />
     Heahian Snarled as a Spider with the torso of a Human and with colorful spider body below its human half. it's Evil Grin was hungry . The Drachid launched herself at Quein. Heahian Dug his claws into the creature before it got halfway. Magic surged through his palms as fire set on the spiders back. Heahian jumped from it and charged Digging his Claws through the Spider's neck. 
<br />
   he backed aay andflung the blood from his hand. "Lets go." They Quickened ther pace,and were at the Tunnles within the hour. Heahian's arms came around her again. "Somethings not right.." 
<br />
    "Your right its not," Kainien slid from the shadows a Glowing Jar in his hand. it was Glowing a deep red; an Errie red.
<br />
    Heahian  removed his cowl of the hooded cloack. "You are a Fool Elf." 
<br />
   "Really all i need to do..." He glaced at the jar then art the child in Quein's arms.

    "Your Not touching Quein or her Child!" Heahian snarled, he crouched in a threatening stance.

    Kainen Grinned. He disapeared and Had Quein in his grip "hand me the child girl." 
<br />
   "No.... Heahian.... go without me." 
<br />
  "No, im not going anywhere without you.. Let her go."
<br />
  Kainien Reached around the girl and took the baby from her grasp; she nearly screamed, as he flung her away. he Grinned his evil grin and opened the jar in his hand.Forcefully he opened the childs mouth and dumped the liquid in his mouth. "There i am done..." Kainien said as he faded with the child in his arms.
<br />
    Quein cried into Heahians shoulder. "Im sorry... " was all he could say.
<br />
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<br />

<br />
  "Good work Kainien ." Innuruks cold voice rang with pleasure as he held the baby. "Take this child and raise  him come back to me in 5 years time... when we can really train this child.... for now we will worry about killing Quein. the God of hate gave the child to the high elf and sent him from is veiw.
<br />
 
<br />
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<br />

<br />
 Heahian held Quein close to himself as they approached Daillen and Vinnie. He bent close and kissed Quein. "I love you Quein... Ive been wanting to ask a Question as of late... " His eyes met hers , the gentle Gray-blue eyes seemed to glow. "Quein...." his arms came tighter about her, they stood like that before Quein anwsered him.
<br />
    "What is your Question... sorry if im not myself but i just let him take him.... i just let him take my child."Heahian kissed her.
<br />
    " I'm Trying to take your mind off that"
<br />
    "What is your Question?"
<br />
    "Quein...." He took her hands in his own. "Quein... will you ,......marry me?"
<br />
    Quein's eyes widened in surpise at his Question. She pressed her body against his and kissed him long and hard, and lovingly. "Yes ...." 
<br />
    Heahian Smiled. 
<br />
  Midnight came and had gone Heahian was once again in his wolfish state as they approached Daillen and Vinnie. the two were asleep as they approached.
<br />
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<br />
    
<br />
   Not far from the two couples, two iksar brothers grinned at each other as they ate the Giant they had killed hours ealiry. "Time to go to the castle." one stood as they headed off into the Dreadlands.
<br />

<br />
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<br />
  
<br />
   It was dawn; it was a beautiful one. a Silver wolf licked her face loveingly. His head rested in her lap when her arm slid up and down his body petting him.
<br />
   " You and him have grown close." Vinnie said when she saw the two.
<br />
   Quein nodded wordlessly.
<br />
  Vinnie smiled, "After Daillen Proposed to me , i felt renewed and re born.  i couldnt turn him down." She looked away. "i can tell by the look on your face ; That wolf-elf proposed to you."
<br />
   Quein looked up at the dark elf. Her face was soft with expression and her eyes were gentle, she wouldnt hurt anyone." yes he did. "She kissed heahian's forhead." Right before he turned into a wolf."
<br />
   Heahian's Gray blue eyes fixed on her, there was love in them. he licked her.
<br />
  ----- So where's Daillen at this time?----
<br />
 "he went to scout for something , he hasnt been back" 
<br />
 The There looked towards the Dreadlands.

    "If you Wissssh you can bring your Friendsss , We are Going to Karnorsssss Casssttle We will Wait for You and your company if you wissssh to come."

   "Where are they , it may not be a safe journey through the Dreadlands." Neokinen said wisely.
<br />
    "The tunnle that leads to Fironia Vie."
<br />
    Neokinen nodded "It may be ssssafe watch yourssself elf."
<br />
   With a secound look back at the Lizard man and wife before running back to his company.
<br />

<br />
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<br />
  
<br />
     Heahian looked back at his fiancee' . She was half asleep against one of the trees.He felt sorry for her, her child gone, the man she really loved was out of her grasp. he Stared at her, her Beauitiful face was flawless, yet it had grown hard and cold, her eyes are what scared him most, as Cold as ice... he shook his wolf's head. Her long black hair blew gently about her in the wind , her hair must have been 4 feet long . She turned to look at him she smiled.
<br />
   "Come here silly dont stand there alone." her voice was soft, but even that wasnt as kind as it was years ago.
<br />
   He came to her side she knelt next to him her arms came around his neck."Heahian... dont leave me... " he felt her face dig into his side , as she cried gently.
<br />
   --- i will always be by your side.---
<br />
  "Thank you.."
<br />
   his soft Gray blue eyes looked at her conserned. he woundered why Daillen , even tried at her heart when he had a wife.
<br />
  Heahian Sighed and licked Quein to comfort her. he couldnt do much as a wolf.
<br />
   --- 2 more months till im a elf again--
<br />
  She smiled at him gently."i will love you always heahian why i said yes to you."
<br />
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<br />
   
<br />
   About a hour later , Daillen returned to them. Heahian was asleep on the slumped sleeping form of Quein's lap. He smiled at least she was happy, why did he have to fall in love with her he had Vinnie. Speaking of which Vinnie went to him and put her arms about him. 
<br />
    "We are moving out it looks as if we found ourselves guides." Daillen said loudly as he pushed his wife to his side.
<br />
    Quein and Heahian awoke at once and went to them.
<br />
    "Who are they?" Heahian asked.
<br />
    "two Iksars that offered a helping hand."
<br />
     "Well lets go." Vinnie said." most iksars are good to their word."
<br />
     "alright then follow me" Daillen led them through the Dreadlands to where the iksars waited.
<br />
    "Hail, there you all." Neonkinen yelled at them waving his scaly hand.
<br />
   "hello Neonkinen."
<br />
    "so lead us to Karnors Neo."
<br />
    "Assss you wisssh." the iksar lead them through the heat of the desert   to ruins of the past , they went to the largest of the buildings , with strange dog men guarding it. 
<br />
    --- they are no allies of ours.---
<br />
   "No they arent" Neokinen agreed.
<br />
   "what are they?" Quein asked.
<br />
   "Drovlargssssss"Isharie said. 
<br />
   They looked at her.
<br />
   "Letssss go in" Neokinen said
<br />
   "aye"
<br />
   The company entered slowly. Their eyes scanned he passage ways leading from the secerate entrance.At the end of the passage a large Drovlarge stood cluching a Giant hammer. it Snorted. 
<br />
   "we need to kill him" 
<br />
   Daillen snuck close to it as he could in the shadows, he began to cast a spell as roots entangled its feet.Neokinen and Isharie charged their staves risen high. Heahian charged next Vinnie kept them alive and Quein summoned fires , and insects to kill it. Daillen would use the roots of the earth most the time. after several minutes the Drovlarg fell dead rivers of blood forming from its corpse.
<br />
    Neokinen took its hammer and tested it as a wepon."Thissss will do better than my presiousss weapon."
<br />
    soon they found themselves in a well lighted area of the castle near the main enertance two Large Drovlargs guarded the Rest of the castle but they were weak and were taken down quickly.The company easily got through the enterance of the castle it didnt get hard till they were deep within. Several Skeletons of Iksars and Sarnaks charged them. 
<br />
     "Run! get out of here i'll hold them off!" Neokinen Shouted to them
<br />
    "I will never leave you Neokinen!" Isharie shouted back.
<br />
     "GO!" He shouted but she remained as hordes of creatures attacked them. Neokinen was killed easily his head was sliced off... Daillen bit his lip and pulled Quein and Vinnie to the enterance, heahian got the message and came, Isharie ran as well but the hordes too kiled her hundereds of spears flew into her scaled back almost killing her instantly. The four remaning ran like cowards into the Dreadlands and into Fironia vie. 
<br />
     "We ran like cowards... we should have stood and fought with them!" Daillen Snarled.
<br />
      "No , They sacerficed themselves for us. They , are probly in a much better place now, Death if just a cold sleep we should embrass." Quein Said startlying them.
<br />
     Heahian Stared at her.. Dose she want to die? the question lingered in his head, he wouldnt let her kill herself or get killed he swore that he would never let her go unless she ordered him too.. he loved her too much.
<br />
     He slept right up against her that night never lettin her presence leave him.
<br />
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<br />
  
<br />
   "Do you want me to kill her then , my lord?"
<br />
   "Yes Vinnie, it will be the last thing i ask of you my daughter." Innuruk grinned down at his beautiful daughter.
<br />
    Vinnie Grinned se would have Daillen to herself she would kill both the wolf and Quein, she grinned at her betrayle.
<br />
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<br />
  
<br />
   The dawn came and went as they sat talking about yesterday they would return to the castle to let their friends rest then, the would travle once more, but these plans were interupted Winged lizards know and Dragon Basil's the very lizards that atacked the Druid camp almost a year ago, attacked them, Daillen Shouted to Heahian and Quein to get out of there and take Vinnie. But the Dark elf Cleric was standing next to the Basilisks , a Evil smile crossed her face.
<br />
    "You shall be mine alone Daillen." she whispered.
<br />
   Heahian Grabbed Quein, he ran her to the Plane of Knowledge book that stood in the center of the tunnle of the Vie, he chanted the ingravings on the stone book and they disapeared into the plane of knowledge.
<br />
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<br />

<br />
   "Vinnie, it was you who attacked the Camp, wasnt it?"
<br />
  "No that was my father... that is right," she grinned" i am innuruks child."
<br />
  Daillen's eyes were wiide." So what is it you want?"
<br />
  "You" she said as she whistled to the lisk's that flew away.
<br />
 "Fine have me." Daillen said giving himself to her.
<br />
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<br />
  
<br />
    Heahian was in his elf for again he held Quein as if she would disapear at anytime. 
<br />
   "Quein dont leave me..."
<br />
   "i wont" she said as se kissed him.

				<td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">It had been 17 years since Daillen's disapearance, Quein's first child's kidnap, the iksar's deaths, Now all was retivally calm. Quein watched as Heahian Trained their 15 year old daughter while she sat with their 4 year old son. Their oldest child had gone off to train with the Cleric's and druids in the art of healing and to see what he would choose, he became a druid. He cerantly was on a dangerus mission in Luclin.
<br />
 
<br />
Quein's smile brodened as Inulynn tackled her father to the ground and gave him a headlock."Gotcha dad your holding back!"
<br />
  
<br />
  "Heh, I'm just getting old!" Heahian said proudly.
<br />
  
<br />
  "Heahian, your barely 37 years of age so get up and train her right!" Quein called. She was teaching magics to her son, they tought both combat, and magics to their childeren.
<br />
 
<br />
  Inulynn grinned and jumped from her father, she has coal black hair like her mother , gray blue eyes like her father, as well as many wolfish features such as long ears with gray tint,  her skin was nut brown, she also had , claw's and fangs like a wolf. She was skilled , in combat, and in magics , she had her mothers furry and anger, her fathers gentle ness and head strongness and agaility.
<br />
  
<br />
Their son on the other had was elfish, in all but two features, his silver hair and long wolf's tail. Their oldest son on the other hand, looked like extically like his father besides hs black eyes. why the cleric's turned him down maybe. Quein smiled as the two training again fell to the ground, it seemed Inulynn had far surpassed her father.
<br />
 
<br />
"Come on dad! you can do better thn that." Inulynn's ear's perked and she dived on her father pushing him to the ground again.she got back to her feet and Snarled. "COME OUT COWARD!" a arrow stuck up from the ground where Heahian was standing moments ealier. 
<br />

<br />
"My dear sister, why call me a coward." a chilling voice called mysteriously, a cloacked elf stepped into veiw, his hair and eyes were black, and the restr of his features were mixed high elf and wood elf.
<br />
 
<br />
Inulynn heard her mother gasp in recognition."Why are you trying to kill my father? i know you arent my brother."
<br />
 
<br />
"But I am. I am a product of Rape, i was stolen from her arms when i was a child, and turned into the druidic son of Innuruk." He pointed at Quein.
<br />

<br />
"If you are Innuruks Druidic son i will kill you neither the less!" Inulynn snarled.
<br />

<br />
"Why are you going to kill my husband if you are who you are , why?"
<br />
 
<br />
"To see what you will do mother." he raised his hand and fire bursed from it, smashing into Heahian, who fell to the ground slumped against a tree. Quein let out a cry of pain as she fell to the ground, her face hidden, her son crying gently in her shoulder.
<br />

<br />
Inulynn;s eyes filled with tears as well as she charged her half brother.But it was Quein who acted , her eyes glowing slightly as well as most of her body. 
<br />

<br />
"It cant be!" the Stranger howled then vanished.
<br />

<br />
Quein sighed and walked to her limp husband. "he's still alive!" she quickly raised her hands and healed him best she could to the point she knew he would live.
<br />

<br />
"Quein... what happened to you?"
<br />

<br />
"yes mother what happened?" Inulynn asked staring at her mother holding her youngest brother, Paw. his named was Woodpaw but everyone called him Paw for short.
<br />

<br />
"What do you mean?" Quein asked.
<br />

<br />
Paw and Inulynn stared at her but it was Heahian who spoke."Your.... hair.. your.. eyes... your .. power... you made.. that kid... run in fear." he breathed.Heahian colapsed his had falling into his wife's shoulder. She touched him... he was dead.. she thought he would live!
<br />

<br />
*************************************************************
<br />

<br />
Daillen approached Kelethan wearly, his left arm missing, as well as half his right ear. He heard a high pitched sceam and wail. Might as well check it out he thought. He  walked into a near by clearing, the limp figure of a vaguely familair old friend. 
<br />

<br />
"How can i help you miss?" he said to the young woman holding a child.
<br />

<br />
She scowled, her Gray blue eyes intease, her wolfish features fliched slightly."Go away you cannot help though's already dead!"
<br />

<br />
"you mean he;s dead?" indicating the limp form.
<br />

<br />
"What dose it look like? why would my mother be crying?" he saw a familiar woman standing not to far from him and the limp form, tears comming from her eyes.
<br />

<br />
"uhh, who was this man?"
<br />

<br />
"My father Heahian." the girl muttered "I am Inulynn."  and she looked at the child in hr arms" and this is my youngest brother , Woodpaw , we call him Paw for short." she giggled.
<br />

<br />
Daillen's eyes were wide."The i know who your mother is, Thank you Inulynn, its been years since if seen Quein."
<br />

<br />
"Who are you?"
<br />

<br />
"Name's Daillen, im a old friend of your mothers."
<br />

<br />
Inulynn stared at the man go talk to her mother, who cried into his no armed shoulder.Daillen;s arm went around her for comfort.
<br />

<br />
"Well lets give Heahian a proper Bareiale!" Daillen said."Cant let him rot befor he gose in the ground eh?"
<br />

<br />
Inulynn stared at him. "Where at though?"
<br />

<br />
"The old grove me your mother and him met in."
<br />

<br />
Quein nodded."That would be nice."
<br />

<br />
*************************************************************
<br />

<br />
"i am sorry my master. i have failed you. the wolf is dead but, it seems that loss has made Quein very powerful, i feld in fear from my own mother."
<br />

<br />
"She is not your mother, nor are you her son, her blood may run in your veins but you belong to the darkness." Innuruks voice said comely.
<br />

<br />
"yes, master." Cavin bowed and disapeared into the darkness.
<br />
*************************************************************
<br />

<br />
Heahian was barried and more tears were shed.
<br />

<br />
"Shall we leave Paw here and go avenge my father?" Inulynn snarled.
<br />

<br />
"yes, leave him with your Grandfather."
<br />

<br />
They leaved Paw with Inulynn's Grandfather, they set out. Little did they know Quein was a Stormrider. the most powerful of the druids of late.

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
        Inulynn looked back at her mother several times, the woman did not resemble the Quein of old, whos hair and eyes were as black as the night sky, now had pure silver hair, and bright green eyes, was was shorter and looked younger.
<br />
     
<br />
       Inulynn felt the weight of her sword shift. It was a large sword, 11 feet long , and it had a broad blade, it looked as if it would weigh 100 lbs, but it weighed much less. It was said to be foraged from a unicorns bones then coated in pure obsidian, stronger then the purest gold. This sword was the first line of defence for her mother, and the 1 armed stranger, Daillen.
<br />

<br />
      The two were both druids, yet long back good friends. Inulynn knew some of the arts of the druid nut not as much as her mother or this stranger, she was better at combat then anything else. Un-like her oldest brother, she shed the blood of emenies instead of healing those injured by the evil essences of the world. She wasnt Harrow after all. Harrow the healer. Typicail, she thought.
<br />

<br />
      It was high-noon when the three finally reached the docks, of the Butcherblock mountians. They wandered the dock village, gettin suplise or talking with the locals untlil they finally sat and talked queitly to eachother.
<br />

<br />
     "So, Daillen, How did you lose that arm of yours?" Inulynn insisted opon the hunderth time trifling with him.Quein thought it was quite humerous.
<br />

<br />
    "Fine! If it will shush you!" Daillen snapped at her. "I lost it 3 months ago escaping from the prison which held me. years back i was captured by Vinnie, the woman who posed to be my wife, when she was Innuruks duaghter. It was 3 months ago but i remember it well."
<br />

<br />
    "Do you Remember who actully cut it off?"
<br />

<br />
    "yes. a half-breed, A half wood elf and a half High elf." Daillen sighed "Cavin, Innuruks Druidic slave, or son, Innuruk wants this druidic son to seek a wife, a wife to be his Queen."
<br />

<br />
    " A Half wood elf and a half high elf? Wow really? sounds like the guy who attacked .. and killed Heahian." Inulynn sighed, ignoring her mothers wail of greif.
<br />

<br />
     "Must have been Cavin, sounds like him. Looks like he was sent."
<br />

<br />
    "I swear if i see him, I will kill him!" Inulynn snarled.
<br />

<br />
     "Tough talk wolf-girl, can you back it up? Cavin is no joke." 
<br />

<br />
    "You honestly under-estimate my training and skills." 
<br />

<br />
     "Aye" 
<br />

<br />
    "Calm down the boats here!" Quein interupted them, as the boat docked silently.
<br />

<br />
     The trio boarded wordlessly , Quein and Daillen decided to go get a room. Inulynn stood out guarding the main cabin area. A wood elf man stumbled towards her obviosly in-toxicated. 
<br />

<br />
     "What do you want?" She snapped at him.
<br />

<br />
     "A little fun, want to provide missy?" he asked 
<br />

<br />
    Inulynn scowled, raised one clawed hand and dug it deep into his face." Try that again ill slice you in two."
<br />
    
<br />
     He didnt look phased, his brow furrowed fusterated. " Mind if i sit here?" He sat next to her and slightly behind her looking at her bottom.
<br />

<br />
     "Nothing funny and i dont care where you sit."
<br />

<br />
    "What do you mean by funny?" He rose to his feet, grabbing at her Bosom.
<br />
  
<br />
     She Snarled, grabbed the color of his tunic." You just better have written your will!" She Clawed his face several times and tossed him overboard.
<br />

<br />
     "Sorry for my brother mylady." A handsome wood elf said his blonde hair  shining dimly and tied back semi-neatly. 
<br />

<br />
     "That Drunken pervert was your brother?"  Inulynn asked Sacastically.
<br />

<br />
     "Aye, ashamed to say. He always thinks attactive ladies such as yourself, are there for his pleasure."
<br />

<br />
     "Figures." Inulynn sighed "Who are you anyway?"
<br />
   
<br />
     "Call me Alan, Alan Stormcaller."
<br />

<br />
    "Call me  Inulynn." she said simply. 
<br />

<br />
     Alan stood next to her talking for a few more minutes before disapearing. He returned to her around 45 minutes after he left her.
<br />
 
<br />
    "Looks like we are being followed. Dout yer heavy sword wil be much help if Pirates attack us."
<br />
   
<br />
    "This sword isnt heavy." She unsheathed her giant sword and handed it to him. Alan gaped at how light it was.
<br />

<br />
    "Theres a large chance they are Dark elfs that are after us." Alan grinned " Maybe they want you." he said sarcasically.
<br />
 
<br />
     "Very funny if they want me they can taste my blade!" Inulynn said sheathing her sword, she was likeing Alan more and more every minute.
<br />

<br />
     "Feisty aren't you." 
<br />

<br />
     "Who are you kidding? of course i am? or i wouldn;t have tossed your brother over." She looked at him more closely. He had a Thin scar on his Right cheek his hair was long and blonde, he looked about 20 years of age, his eyes were a purple blue, and a smal peice of his left ear was missing. He was musclar for a wood elf, wore light chainmail armor, with a bow and Quiver strapped across his back.
<br />

<br />
    "You have a point." 
<br />

<br />
     "All hands on Deck! All hands on Deck!"  The captains voice rang. Alan Scowled and disapeared into the crowd. he came back within moments 
<br />

<br />
     "Darkies a whole cruser full of them! Comming right for us." Alan Scowled furiously. He looked at her and forced a smile. Alan put his hand on her right cheek then removed it quickly. He bent then kissed her."Just incase i dont make it through this fight."
<br />
    
<br />
      Inulynn stared at him and touched her lips." I hope so; or i would have given you anther scar. " She grinned at him.
<br />

<br />
    He grinned back. The Ship caught up with them effortlessly, Dark elf sailors jumped aboard to either be shot down by Alan's Arrows, or cut down by Inulynn's sword.
<br />

<br />
   After what seemed hours the deck was stained brown with the blood of dark elves, a cloaked man appeared he casted a spel hitting Alan in the chest. The acher clutched his ignighted chest and colapsed. 
<br />

<br />
      The figure removed his cowl. Cavin! Inulynn Scowled , she raised her sword the the ready and charged him. Cavin and his ship disapeared into the mist. Inulynn stopped short of the edge of the boat. She Sheathed the sword , and rushed to Alan. his breathing was shalow, his wound bleed furiously.
<br />
      
<br />
      "Alan, Dont die Damnit!'" she put her hands on the bleeding wood and casted a complex healing spell. Healing the wound almost perfectly. He gasped and looked up at her.
<br />

<br />
      He smiled. "Thanks, i owe you."
<br />
    
<br />
      "You dont Owe me." She smiled "You would have done the same for me."
<br />

<br />
       "Yah i would." He sat up in her arms and kissed her cheek. She blushed and stood away from him.
<br />
   
<br />
      "We will be arriving in Freeport within the next few days." Alan said to her , hours later.
<br />

<br />
     "Good... Can finish with why i am comming here then."
<br />

<br />
     "Mind if i ask what is it your doing in Freeport?"
<br />

<br />
    "Need to find my Brother Harrow."
<br />

<br />
     "Why?"
<br />
   
<br />
     "To Avenge my father Heahian, Cavin killed him."
<br />

<br />
     "I've heard rumors of Heinian, the half wood elf and half wolf, who knew you were his daughter? You traveling with anyone?"
<br />

<br />
     "My mother and a old friend of hers."
<br />
   
<br />
     "Would you mind if i joined you? i need to get back at that  Cavin for almost killing me."
<br />
 
<br />
     "We'll see." She lent into him resting her head on his chest, he fell asleep within minutes when his arm wrapped about her.
<br />

<br />
    Inulynn awoke to the cold sea air blowing in her face. she sighed and stood, waking Alan when she did. 
<br />

<br />
   "Inulynn..." He took her hands in his own. "Im coming with you despite what you say...." He pulled her into his arms and kissed her passonatly. 
<br />

<br />
    She backed away and stared at him. "i shouldnt be doing this... i really shouldnt... " she turned her back to him. " But i cant readly stop you from following me, so i might as well embrace the fact that you want to stay." 
<br />

<br />
    "I see. Inulynn the thing is the last few days ive known you .. ive grown fond of you."
<br />
     
<br />
    She blushed at him.
<br />

<br />
The Gentle sea breeze blew Inulynn's hair all about her, Her eyes shut against the damn air blowing in her face. she gazed into the endless ocean seeing what seemed to be land in the distance. she smiled, Freeport ... they were almost their. Inulynn jumped from her perch and wandered over to her mother's cabin. She knocked on the door with the hilt of her sword. 
<br />

<br />
"We will be in Freeport shortly" she called through the door.
<br />

<br />
"Alright, will get ready for port then." Quein called through the door.
<br />

<br />
Inulynn turnedto leave just to run into Daillen returning to the cabin he shared with her mother. "Sorry." 
<br />

<br />
"Its alright" Daillen smiled at her and patted her head befoe slipping into the cabin.
<br />

<br />
Inulynn stood alone on deck awaiting something to happen. She let a small yelp of surpirse from her lips when Alan hugged her from behind.
<br />
"Alan you scared me." 
<br />

<br />
"Sorry" He kissed her cheek before leaving her to do his job. Inulynn wasnt so certain she should have fallen in love with the sailor.  The Ship finally docked in Freeport. The two druids , the warrior- Druid, and ranger sailor walked through the streets of Freeport to the Common lands. It took quite awhile since Freeport was a crowded city full of hustle and bustle , mostly they couldnt move and if they did they lost eachother. 
<br />

<br />
They finally fought through the crowed city to the common lands. Daillen looked over to Quein then Inulynn then the not-so-trusted Alan."Myself and Quein will look through the East commonlands for Harrow, Alan and Inulynn take the west , meet back here sundown tomorrow with or without him." The others nodded and split their ways. 
<br />

<br />
The night in the West common lands was clear , the moon was full and the a tapestry with a errie blackness then with the pinpricks of starlight high above the chriping crickets and silence of the ground. Inulynn and Alan Sat side by side talking silently, alan rested his head on her shoulder then fell asleep. She smiled at the sailor letting him rest against a tree. Her ears perked as in the distance Thunderous footfalls echod their approach. A hill giant.... Inulynn scowled in disgust as she raced in the direction of the giant. She un-sheathed her sword and crouched ready to atacked the giant as it stomped stupidly into veiw, she drew back into the shadows becomming one with the night. 
<br />

<br />
She swallowed what fear she had and crept out into the light of the moon. She Crouched again this time jumping into the air, she drove her sword into the back of the creature landing on the other side of it. The Giant Roared bringing its hammer onto the spo she stood, she jumped from it quickly enough, the hammer came again and again slowing slighty each time as the pool of blood behind the giant grew, and pain sear through it. Finally it slowed enough for Inulynn to go on the Offence again . She jumped up again digging her sword deep into the monsters gut, cutting through muscle vital organs and bone, the Giant roars again this time Grabbing her in its fist. She Howled in pain as the giant's grasp titened. 
<br />
**********************************************************
<br />

<br />
Alan  jumped to his feet when he heard a Giant;s roar. He looked around for Inulynn and frowned, she must have gone after the giant. He ran in the direction of the Roar , he came into veiw of the gian standing in a pool of its own blood a sword blade down into the earth and Inulynn bein crushed by the giants grasp he snarled running to Inulynns sword, he pulled it free running to the giants ankles he swung the sword hitting the bleeding giant in the leg slicing through senu tendans mucle and bone right through the leg, The Giant roared pitifully as it fell ti the ground releaasing Inulynn, who fell to the ground in a limp heap. Alan ran over to her side, sheathing her sword and craddling her in his arms. He lifted her unconious body and ran into the night.
<br />
***********************************************************
<br />
Harrow's ears percked as a giant roared its last time in the distance. He sighed as he walked through the Commonlands . He would be back at the druid house in no time he thought. When he finally got there a small crowd was gathered in a corner of the area. Harrow sighed and went to see what the clatter was about he noticed a wood elf with blood all down his tunic and leggings, when he saw people like that it disgusted him. 
<br />

<br />
Harrow gaped when he got through the crowd, his unconsios little sister lay scarped and bruised , Harrow healed her and let her rest. Inulynn moaned as she sat up and looked around the first face she saw was Harrow's.
<br />

<br />
"Harrow!" she flung her arms around her older brother. Alan came over and hugged Inulynn too whispering something in her ear. Harrow didnt like this Alan guy one bit he was covered in blood yet he hugged harrows sister. He forgot that Inulynn too was covered in blood.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

The Trio waited patiently for the return of Quein and Daillen, they were several hours over meeting time. Inulynn sighed and rested her shoulder on Alan's shoulder, she was tired , her fatigue and constant useage of her body had cought up with her, the girl was asleep in moments. Harrow glaced at her sleeping sister resting against this man he knew nothing about besides him claiming to be a ranger. His gaze returned to the dark dust filled desert.
<br />

<br />
*************************************************************
<br />

<br />
Daillen colapsed against  a tree his fatigue overwhelmed him. Quein seated herself next to him , she had kept to herself the whole time they were within the Eastren commonlands.
<br />

<br />
"We're late you know." She said.
<br />

<br />
"I know, Blame the sand giant..." 
<br />

<br />
"And this Squad of teir'dail bountyhunters." Quein said indicating the humaniod shadows around them, her Night vision was spetacular.She rose to her feet, an sighed ." Lets get going." She grabbed his hand and lead him towards Freeport.
<br />
*************************************************************
<br />

<br />
Cavin smiled his evil smile at his blood father. They had gone over the plan and it was simple. Seperate the Emenies forces and let them kill themselves. Of course his sister mght pose a problem, she was highly skilled, he knew he could match her if he needed to but he thought what was the point when he could kill her with spells? But something was nagging at him, What if he didnt want to kill her? 
<br />

<br />
"Your gettin' soft is all ,Cavin." Kainien said eyeing his son. 
<br />

<br />
"Pfft why? i dont need anyone not even you." 
<br />

<br />
"You need Innuruk."
<br />

<br />
Cavin scowled. "Why?" 
<br />

<br />
"Without him Tunare may have struck you down herself by now."
<br />

<br />
"Tunare has not the guts for that."
<br />

<br />
Kainien laughed boyishly. "As i thought years ago when i left Innuruks protection."
<br />

<br />
"What happened father?"
<br />

<br />
"I fell in love with a young beautiful woman and she ... She well... " Kainien held his cloak up so his son could clearly see a long scar that ran from the top of his shoulder to his waist. "She tried to strike me down, She was tunare's daughter, mearly a nymph, but i killed her anyway..."
<br />

<br />
"Love is for the weak , father."
<br />

<br />
"Say that yourself, at least i dont fall in love with my half sister!" 
<br />

<br />
Cavin Growled and Hit his father over the head with his fist. " What ever i dont like her, In fact ill kill her tonight instead of letting a scranny goblin do it." 
<br />

<br />
"Go ahead if you have the heart." 
<br />

<br />
Cavin grummbled and moved away from his father his scowl was feirce.
<br />
*************************************************************
<br />

<br />
Inulynn yawned as she awoke, she glanced over at her brother then over at Alan. Alan smiled at her. "Well your awake again." 
<br />

<br />
"Yes so it seems." She grinned at him. 
<br />

<br />
"once you two stop acting like childeren we can get out of here. Mom and her friend are here." Harrow said loathnessly, He didnt like the fact alan and inulynn were together.
<br />

<br />
Just as he said two red faced exhausted elves ran through a cloud of rolling dust, shadows chasd them, the glance Quein threw her daughter told her to follow suit. "Come on." She grabbed Alan and followed Quein and Daillen through the less crowded steets of the city Harrow followed them quickly.
<br />

<br />
The company stopped at the docks the shadows were gone their faces covered in sweat and dust. Their chests heaved as they gasped for breath. Daillen plopped down and went to sleep almost imedately.
<br />

<br />
"I'll take first guard, get some sleep you guys." Inulynn muttered. 
<br />

<br />
"Ill help you..." Alan  muttered grinning at her. Harrow growled and fell asleep away from the others, Quein sat down and slept against Daillen's side leaving Alan and Inulynn alone.
<br />

<br />
He hugged her close to him. "Inulynn... something about tonight dosent seem right." he had hugged her to feel her against him and tell her this.
<br />

<br />
"I see , lets stay on our guard then." She muttered appearng to kiss his cheek several times, she hd cought on fairly quickly.
<br />
*************************************************************
<br />

<br />
Cavin motioned his father to follow him to the docks, he saw three sleeping and Inulynn , his half sister, in a lovers dance with a blonde wood elf. This angered him slightly, why was he jeolious? Cavin sighed pulling his cloak around him tightly. the two cloaked figures approached  the 5 from kelethan.  He noticed something about his sister, her eyes followed him and his father while she kept up with what the elf with her was doing. 
<br />

<br />
Was she literally trying to look non-commited to her guard duity while actully doing it? He sighed might as well get this done, He raised his hand pointing it towards the three sleepig he casted a simple teleportation spell and sent the three into some unknown place as they were bathed in light.
<br />

<br />
Instantly Inulynn and the elf were up on their feet their weapons drawn. Kainien rooted the elf and casted many spells opon him as the elf shot arrows back at the high elf. Cavin drew a sword and charged the girl, who matched his every move. His cowl fell back revealing his face as he fought the woman, she gaped slightly and dodged his attacks launching her own slicing his left arm off. Cavin jumped back in pain and disapeared into the shadows. Inulynn turned to Alan he was burned badly but the elf that was his opponet was dead due to a arrow in the head. Blood bathed the dock, but Rain later the evening washed it away. 
<br />

<br />
Alan kissed her passonately for several minutes when the roots were torn through. The two slept soundly the rest of the night side by side.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<br />

<br />
"Aye it dose." she kissed his cheek.
<br />

<br />
He smiled at her and kissed her back. "Lets get abored before we are left behind."  Alan said helping Inulynn abored. They choose a cabin and nurses his burns while they rested. The ship took about 17 days to reach butcherblock, Alan held Inulynn close she had cought sea sickness ... well so he thought. Her symtems only worsened as they got closer to Kelethan. he took her to the druid guild in Kelethan for treatment.
<br />

<br />
"Will she be okay Heartwood?"
<br />

<br />
"I belive so, just needs bed rest is all." The Heartwood druid master said. 
<br />

<br />
Alan nodded and carried the weak Inulynn to his families home.
<br />
*************************************************************
<br />

<br />
Quein looked around the wasteland as he comrades , Daillen and Harrow had gone to scout out the area. the desert heat was overwhelming she knew they were in Dreadlands... A Place like this was never forgetable, her mind wandered to her daughter and her new friend... they had been seperated just under weeks ago...
<br />

<br />
Harrow and Daillen returned minutes later "We really need to get out of there." 
<br />

<br />
"Aye we do."
<br />

<br />
The three left towards Fironia Vie.
<br />
*************************************************************
<br />
Alan sat at Inulynn's bed side her hair was damp with sweat and she almost never stopped sweating with fever. She has slipped into a coma and the Druid master had come to Examine her again.
<br />

<br />
"Better leave me to my work kid." he muttered 
<br />

<br />
"Okie..." Alan said leaving the room. About a hour later the Druid came from the room a big smile on his face.
<br />
 
<br />
"She's fine just exhausted get some food and water into her and she should be fine!"
<br />

<br />
Alan sighed with his relief. "She awake?" the druid nodded. "Alright ill get her some food and water."
<br />

<br />
"Not  to much at once."
<br />

<br />
Alan went catiously into Inulynn's room and smiled at him." Brought you some food." 
<br />

<br />
"Thanks.."  Inulynn eyed the sword in the corner of the room. "Alan....." 
<br />

<br />
"Yes?"
<br />

<br />
Inulynn smiled, "I.... I'm...." She couldnt say what she wanted to say.
<br />

<br />
"Something the matter?" He sat next to the young woman. She smiled and kissed him. 
<br />

<br />
"No..." She looked away. "Umm... im starving..." Alan laughed and handed her some rations and water. She ate them quickly and laid back down to rest. He stayed at her beside until she awoke again she was unwilling to tell him what she tried to say before. 
<br />

<br />
"Alan... Take my sword and go in Lesser faydark. Find the Silver Unicorn and show it the sword... Return and tell me what happened..."
<br />

<br />
Alan nodded "But why?" 
<br />

<br />
"Just do it.... for me."
<br />

<br />
He took the sword and headed away towards Lesser Faydark. Inulynn didnt know how to tell him what happened to her. She douted she could tell anyone. she let her hands rest over her stomache she felt a gentle tenshin and smiled she'd have to tell him. She smiled and pulled on her armor. She rushed from the home and towards Lesser Faydark.
<br />

<br />
Alan came  upon the Lesser faydark Entrance and her rapid footfalls behind him. He turned and saw Inulynn running towards him her breathing rapid. "Are you crazy?!"
<br />

<br />
"Nope...." she took his free hand and rested it on her stomache. In a instant Alan dropped the sword and held her close...
<br />

<br />
"Inulynn.... I'm sorry.... uh.... Will you marry me?" he said it awkwardly without a ring.
<br />

<br />
She smiled and kissed him ."Aye." The 15 year old woman and the young sailor returned to Kelethan. Within a month They were wed.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Quein ran her hand through her dark hair as she walked through the Oasis. It had been several months since she had been seperated from her daughter Harrow and Daillen were fighting more and more nd she was gettin sick of being in the presence of either. The Three entered Freeport and once again got on  a ship. it was a month before they arrived in Butcherblock, they headed towards Kelethan.
<br />

<br />
"Hey isnt that Alan?" Harrow asked. as he saw a blond elf talking to several guards. 
<br />

<br />
"maybe..." the three snuck up on him.
<br />

<br />
"Godamnit! Where the heck did she go if you bunch saw her?" 
<br />

<br />
"she was headed towards Caulderen Elf! Now get out of our faces before we cut you down." 
<br />

<br />
"pfft, thanks for your help." He said running off in a different direction.
<br />

<br />
"Im not sure.. lets ask the guards." Daillen said "Excuse me kind sirs who was that you were just speaking too?"
<br />

<br />
"Likes its any of our buisiness, he didnt tell us his name." the guards snorted and walked away.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

"Im... sorry Alan.." Inulynn muttered.
<br />

<br />
"It's okay at least i found you before you got into to much trouble." He said smiling at her taking the baby from her arms.

Quein and her companions walked through Kelethan. Heading for her Granfathers home.
<br />

<br />
"Dad you there?" Quein called through the door.
<br />

<br />
"Quein!" Her father muttered opening the door releasing Woodpaw who jumped into his mothers arms. " Damn Inulynn's been back for about 10 months already, she;s outta town right now though."
<br />

<br />
"Inulynn? How is she? What she been up too?" Quein asked exitment overwhelming her.
<br />

<br />
"I dont know i only saw her once bein carried to the druid guild, She was pretty sick when she got back."
<br />

<br />
"Carried? by whom?" Harrow asked.
<br />

<br />
"I dont know a blonde wood elf man."
<br />

<br />
Harrow scowled. " Hey Grandpa theres that elf again!"  Paw yelled at pointing Alan out he was talking to a human man holding a bondle in his arms.
<br />

<br />
Quein Daillen and Harrow watched the young sailor for a time before he disapeared for several minutes returning without the bundle."Lets talk to him..." Quein said moving over to the elf. "Alan." She muttered making him jump several feet into the air. 
<br />

<br />
He pounded his chest several times apprently trying to get his heart to work again.  "Quein... Harrow... Daillen... Hello.... you guys surprised me." 
<br />

<br />
"Alan wheres Inulynn?" Quein asked. 
<br />

<br />
He blushed "She's in the forest somewhere she told me she needed some alone.. time."
<br />

<br />
"Hahah very funny Alan!" The human behind him laughed. "Names Erwin, friend of Alan's family."
<br />

<br />
"I'll get her wait here." Alan disapeared down a ramp and returned with a older looking Inulynn. 
<br />

<br />
"Mom! Harrow!" Inulynn hugged her family "Paw! Gramps..." She huged her other family as well. 
<br />

<br />
"Inulynn i was so worried..." Quein muttered "my dad said you were ill."
<br />

<br />
Inulynn blushed and hugged Alan's arm.  "I wasnt ill mom..." 
<br />

<br />
Harrow snarled a little faster minded than the others "Alan what the hell did you do to my sister?" 
<br />

<br />
Alan sighed "Alan didnt do anything... I did... Harrow if you have a problem take it up with me."
<br />

<br />
"What do you mean? why are you defending him?"
<br />

<br />
"She loves him..." Quein said with a smile.
<br />

<br />
Inulynn stared at her mother, Alan too stared at her. "How'd you know mom?"
<br />

<br />
"haha For one the rings of both of your fingers and the looks on your faces..." Everyone present laughed. 
<br />

<br />
"So my younger sisters married at 15?!?!?!" Harrow howled. 
<br />

<br />
"Uhh..... ya....." Inulynn scratched her head. "Be right back..." Inulynn disapeared down the ramps, she decided it was good as time as any to show off her month old child.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<br />

<br />
"What do you mean?" Inulynn asked.
<br />

<br />
"You were taken here 7 years ago... After a fall from Kelethan... Your husband has been worried sick..."
<br />

<br />
Suddenly  it all came back. She ran down the ramp to her families home , she tripped and fell about a 100 feet, all went black. Inulynn held her head. "I want to see him.." She muttered.
<br />

<br />
"As you wish, Ill send for him." The Cleric said, she turned and left the room.
<br />

<br />
Inulynn lent against the nearest wall, a Tear falling from her cheek. "Inulynn!!" Alan said as he opened the door a young girl about the age of 8 at his side. 
<br />

<br />
"Alan... " Inulynn replied her smiled faint as he came and hugged her to him. The child kept her distance she kept staring at her parents with disgust and hatred. "How are my mother and Daillen and... the rest of my family.
<br />

<br />
"You me and Paw are the only survivors..." Alan said bleakly.
<br />

<br />
"What do you mean?" Inulynn asked panic mirrored in her face.
<br />

<br />
"About  a year after the insident, Cavin returned this time stronger you mother scared him away but decided we should put a end to this once and for all... Quein... Harrow... Daillen... their all dead..." Alan said.
<br />

<br />
"Damn you Cavin damn you!" Inulynn screamed crying into her husbands shoulder.
<br />

The child in the room glared at them and left silently . Her plots her own a smile crept across her face.

<br />
It had been years since anything had happened really... Inulynn over time regained her Stregth and tried to get closer to her daughter . The girl alowed no such relationship howevr.  The night was chill and damp, the girl grinned as she took a candle to her room and dropped it on the wooden floor setting fire to the home imdetatily. She took her dagger and went into her parents room Driving it into her fathers back, killing him. 
<br />

<br />
Inulynn awoke at the smell of smoke she looked over to her husband his ashen face and the pool of blood that surrouned him told her he was dead. "Alan."
<br />

<br />
"Forget him" The cold voice of her daughter said.
<br />

<br />
"You killed him didnt you?" 
<br />

<br />
"Aye..."
<br />

<br />
"Damn you." Inulynn rose to her feet and the child disappeared into the inferno heading towards her uncles home. Inulynn Dressed and ran after the girl. She arrived their just as the girl slipped into the house. Several screams told inulynn the girl had done her worst. "Paw... Alan.... Gramps.."
<br />

<br />
The Child stood before Inulynn then "Your heart and soul is now forever pained .... You shall never seek Vengance for your loved ones....For your own blood has undone them all." The Girl rose the dagger to her neck and thrust it into her flesh.
