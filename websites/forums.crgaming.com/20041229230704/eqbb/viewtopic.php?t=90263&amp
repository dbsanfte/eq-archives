--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
A very nice Tips and Tricks guide copy from EQ Beastlords.
<br />
Enjoy!
<br />

<br />
Tips and Tricks 
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
<br />
Performance / Raid settings 
<br />

<br />
/SHOWGRASS OFF reduces lag in newer zones with moving tree branches 
<br />

<br />
/showspelleffects off will remove the most of the pretty spell effects. 
<br />
To remove the rest, you will need to go into the display options to remove the new particle effect. 
<br />

<br />
/shownames off turns all names off so you don't get lag from all the names. Good for raids. 
<br />
/shownames 1 (reduces everyones name to just thier first name) 
<br />
/shownames 2 (reduces everyones name to first and last) 
<br />
/shownames 3 (Shows title and whole name) 
<br />
/shownames 4 (shows guild, title, and wholename) 
<br />

<br />
/hidecorpses all or /hidecorpses allbutgroup works well to get rid of dead bodies that you don't need to loot and are interfering with targetting. 
<br />
Targeting your corpse and typing /loot will also loot for you. 
<br />

<br />
For pet classes: Pet will always have its last target's corpse targetted if you haven't cleared its targets or given it new attack order yet. So if a mob dies inside a wall, assist your pet, go next to the wall and type /loot. 
<br />

<br />
Ctrl - (minus) to lower clip plane without having to switch to options. 
<br />
Ctrl + (plus) to move clip plane back out. 
<br />

<br />
If you are on a high-speed connection, find the file datarate.txt in your EQ Directory and change it so the value is 8. This will cause larger packets to be downloaded to you (decreasing lag) ( have heard of values higher than 8 causing frequent LD on zone) 
<br />

<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
<br />
Casting 
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
<br />
Ducking Interrupts Casting Immediately… rather than trying to run or jump, duck will stop it now 
<br />

<br />
/target will target the closest thing whose name is unique. This works on mobs too. For example. There are 2 players named Fred and Fredrick on the raid, both not in the group. Fredrick needs healing. Type '/tar Fredr' and as long as Fredrick is within 50 feet of you (forwards or backwards - doesn't matter) she will get selected to be your current target. If you type '/tar Fred' and both Fred and Fredrick is within 50 of you, your current target will not change since 'Fred' is not a unique name 
<br />

<br />
/tgb on - lets you cast group spells on another group without having to be invited 
<br />

<br />
/rt will return a tell to the last person that gave you a tell 
<br />
It actually returns the target of the person, that send you a tell. Providing they are within range. 
<br />

<br />
alt+# 1 - 8 casts the spell in that spot 
<br />

<br />
Arrow keys left and right flip through the pages of your spellbook if you have it up 
<br />

<br />
/book # opens your spellbook to page #. 
<br />

<br />
Right click on a empty spell gem will bring up your spell list menu. 
<br />
Right Click on the "open spell book" image brings up the save spell set. 
<br />

<br />
/memspellset index/name (/memspellset buff or /memspellset 1) to mem your spell set. 
<br />

<br />
Cure disease will cure Slow 
<br />

<br />
Cure poison will cure Tash 
<br />

<br />
If the cleric has divine aura on, or the bard is playing their divine aura spell, they will not teleport with you nor will they succor. 
<br />

<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
<br />
General 
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
<br />

<br />
To get into The Hole, go down to the bottom where the pond is in Paineel. When you are in the water, in the upper right portion of the rocks there is a hole you can squeeze through. Wolfform helps in doing this. Keep trying and eventually you'll make it through. 
<br />

<br />
/ttell. Targeted tell. Useful for sending a tell to the owner of a corpse. Works for the living too 
<br />

<br />
/join &lt;channel name&gt; will have you join channel 
<br />
/list will list all the channels you are in 
<br />
/list # will list all in that specific channel # 
<br />
/# to speak in a channel 
<br />
/leave &lt;channel #&gt; will have you leave channel 
<br />
/autojoin &lt;channel name&gt; will make you autojoin that channel. 
<br />
/autojoin channel is a toggle. To stop autojoin just retype it and it will leave autojoin. 
<br />

<br />
/rsay or /rs have you talking in the raid channel (PoP only) 
<br />

<br />
For characters with pets, pressing the respective group select function key (F1 - F6) twice will target their pet, provided the pet is within 50 feet of you. 
<br />

<br />
Pressing F1-F6 targets respective person in group, F1 being yourself. 
<br />
If you press the F1-F6 key again you will target the individuals pet. 
<br />
F7 targets the closest player in view 
<br />
F8 targets the closest NPC in view 
<br />

<br />
Pressing 1-10 initiates respective Hotkey 
<br />

<br />
/doability #number 
<br />
abilities 1-6 are standard abilities and 7 – 10 are the combat abilities. 
<br />

<br />
When creating the macro's, you can put " /stand " on the first line to save yourself time having to find your stand hotkey, and on the flip side you can use /sit (note: /sit can be used as a toggle) 
<br />

<br />
%r returns the race of a player character. 
<br />
%s returns the subjective pronoun (he, she, or it). 
<br />
%o returns the objective pronoun (him, her, or it). 
<br />
%p returns the possessive pronoun (his, her, or its) 
<br />
%m gives back your pets name 
<br />

<br />
' is a shortcut for /say 
<br />
: is a shortcut for /emote 
<br />

<br />
/assist &lt;target&gt; will target what ever that person is targeting. 
<br />

<br />
/assist will target what ever that person or MoB is targeting. 
<br />

<br />
/doability # will perform the numbered ability 
<br />
/do # works as well. 
<br />

<br />
To not auto attack when you type /assist, type either /assist off or in your EQClient.ini file change AttackOnAssist=TRUE to read FALSE 
<br />

<br />
If you need to cast after running, tap a short turn before casting to avoid having an interrupted spell. (This forces the server to update your location so it doesn't think you're still running) 
<br />

<br />
You can left-click-and-hold an inventory slot and drag-and-drop it into an empty hot button. So, her Crucible of Escape is always available for use without opening her inventory. 
<br />

<br />
Once you remember to use it (you can use it on corpses) it's amazing. Ever talk to someone with a horribly complicated name to spell at a glance? Target them and /tt. 
<br />

<br />
After you hit the "r" to reply to the last person you can also hit the "tab" key to cycle through all the people that have sent you a tell. Up to 10 I think. Useful if you are talking to several people at once. 
<br />

<br />
To check if you are hidden or sneaking type /target &lt;your name&gt; If it targets you, you are not invisible. 
<br />

<br />
To find a corpse that is missing, make a hotkey with /target &lt;player name&gt; and run around hitting the hotkey. When you are in range of the corpse, you will see the name appear in your target window. Then type /corpse to summon it. 
<br />

<br />
How to drag multiple corpses: 
<br />
Make a hotkey(s) with the following: 
<br />
/corpse &lt;name1&gt; 
<br />
/pause 2 
<br />
/corpse &lt;name2&gt; 
<br />
/pause 2 
<br />

<br />
/ho &lt;macro name&gt; 
<br />
/hotbutton *Name_With_No_Spaces* *First Line Can Have Spaces* 
<br />
Thus... 
<br />
/hotbutton Help /g HELP ME!!! 
<br />
Gives you a hotbutton that when depressed says 
<br />
"HELP ME!!!" to your group. 
<br />
Slightly pointless addition, but you can have spaces in a hotbutton label if you use quotes. 
<br />
i.e. /hotbutton "Shout Help" /g HELP ME!!! 
<br />
creates a hotbutton labelled "Shout Help". The only thing is, if the label is too long, when it wraps, part of it may drop off the bottom of the button. 
<br />

<br />
etc for as many corpses as you need. You will need to move slowly, but you will be able to summon multiple corpses along as one giant pile. 
<br />

<br />
Hold shift down and hit pageup or pagedown and you will scroll the main chat window up or down 1 page at a time. 
<br />

<br />
Hold shift and up or down arrows will cycle through the messages you have typed 
<br />

<br />
Ducking significantly reduces falling damage when running on hilly terrain 
<br />

<br />
Dropped swords/daggers point north 
<br />
Clouds always move east to west 
<br />
Moss only grows on the north side of trees 
<br />

<br />
To stop moving quickly while on a horse, just click off the horse icon 
<br />

<br />
Sitting causes Agro with mobs. This can work to your advantage if the mob doesn’t summon. If you need to keep a mob off the tank for a moment, sit and as it comes towards you, stand back up. This is known as ping ponging the mob. The mob will go back and forth between you and the tank. 
<br />

<br />
“ – “ on the numberpad is the Default Key for Screen shot 
<br />

<br />
cntrl click picks up a single item from a stack 
<br />
shift click picks up an entire stack of items 
<br />
This also works when you are purchasing/selling items. To buy only one of any stackable type of item, hold the CTRL key and click BUY. To buy a stack, hold the CTRL key and click BUY. Do the same thing to sell single units or whole stacks. 
<br />

<br />
/autoinventory will take whatever's on your cursor and put it in your inventory. Very useful for tradeskills. 
<br />

<br />
When looking at a merchant's inventory, hold your cursor over the inventory and press alt -- you'll be able to see the names of all items without having to click on each one. 
<br />

<br />
Shift and up and down arrows will let you scroll through what you have previously written. Comes in handy when someone has missed your tell or reply. 
<br />

<br />
/toggleinspect off Will keep you from inspecting someone everytime you try to click on them (I found this very annoying in groups). 
<br />
/toggleinspect on will turn it back on. 
<br />

<br />
To put a comment in your profile that others see when they inspect you, go to a non first person view(F9), target and inspect yourself, and type in the box. 
<br />

<br />
Grab a KEi, load up your cheapest, fastest casting spell for the skill you wish to raise and head to the Plain of Knowledge zone. 
<br />
Begin casting whatever spell you have chosen, on yourself. the spell, be it a de-buff, DD or DoT, will not effect you, but will still raise the skill. buffs will work as normal. 
<br />

<br />
One more thing to add: 
<br />
You can shorten any command to just the letters required to make it unique, 
<br />
and some commands have explicit shortcuts. 
<br />

<br />
Examples of shortest unique command: 
<br />
/shownames and /shown 
<br />
/ttell and /tt 
<br />
/target and /tar 
<br />

<br />
Examples of an explicit shortcut: 
<br />
/tell and /t 
<br />
/gsay and /g 
<br />

<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
<br />
Terms 
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
<br />

<br />
MA: Main Assist, the person that tells everyone else what to kill. 
<br />

<br />
MT: Main Tank, the person who you try and get a mob to hit 
<br />

<br />
ST: Secondary Tank: backup for MT if stuff happens. 
<br />

<br />
SA: Secondary Assist: Backup for MA if MA goes down or MA misses something. 
<br />

<br />
OT: Off Tank, person who is tanking a mob that the raid force is not trying to kill at the moment. 
<br />

<br />
MA is not the same as MT its just that some people do both jobs at the same time. The only real difference between MT and MA is that MT doesn't have to know what mobs are more dangerous or what mobs are mezzable, but the MA does (otherwise you're not doing your job). Usually one person can do both jobs at the same time. 
<br />

<br />
Rampage is an extra round of attacks, that a mob can do, that hits the first person on the rampage list. 
<br />
Mobs that rampage have a hate list and a rampage list. Rampage is not changeable, you enter at a specific point, and that is where you remain (well, you can't lessen your position on the list I should say.. when somebody dies, you go up a place). Some PoP raid mobs can AE rampage and hit everyone in the mob's melee range at once. 
<br />

<br />
At the point of agroing a mob, a MA and rampage tank will "agro" it. 
<br />
This sets the following 2 lists 
<br />
AGRO LIST RAMPAGE LIST 
<br />
MA MA 
<br />
SA SA 
<br />

<br />
Now the raid engages, the agro list will change (e.g. clerics and debuffers will rise), but the rampage list is unchanged 
<br />
AGRO LIST RAMPAGE LIST 
<br />
MA MA 
<br />
Cleric1 SA 
<br />
Enchanter1 Cleric1 
<br />
Shaman1 Enchanter1 
<br />

<br />
10 minutes on... the lists would look something like 
<br />
AGRO LIST RAMPAGE LIST 
<br />
MA MA 
<br />
Wizard1 SA 
<br />
Rogue1 Cleric1 
<br />
Monk1 Enchanter1 
<br />

<br />
Rampage will never hit the MA either (if the mob is meleeing you, he can't rampage you) 
<br />

<br />
Another is Flurry: 4 extra attacks on 1 target (whoever the mob is currently beating on) 
<br />

<br />
Common battle tactics, and why? i.e. MT gets in front of mob, no one hits till they call it... then all melee stays behind the mob. Why? When is it useful? When is it not useful? 
<br />

<br />
Because mobs riposte. When a mob melees for several hundred, if you take a few ripostes you are going to be substantially low on health and requiring healers to focus on more than just the MT/MA. Also, because parry, block, riposte etc don't come into play from behind, so you will do better damage</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<br />
ENRAGE- when a mob enrages (you'll see a message to the effect of 'A moss snake has become ENRAGED'), it will riposte all attacks made by characters that are attacking from the front.  In order to avoid taking damage, make sure you're behind the mob or off to one side of it.  If you are facing the mob and see the ENRAGE message, turn off autoattack and move to the side or back of the mob.  The main tank should turn off autoattack during this time as well, since you won't be able to hit the mob until it is no longer enraged.  You'll just be taking extra damage.
<br />

<br />
If you've ever heard a reference to 'plowing enrage', it refers to a person who didn't turn off autoattack or move out of in front of a mob that enraged, thus taking a serious beating as the mob riposted every one of their attacks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

Even worse is with people who are very SLOW about learning this stuff, or simply aren't paying attention when you explain what it is.  This is usually a problem in lower-level raids, places like Kael where only a handful of mobs will enrage.
<br />

<br />
And more annoying than that are the people who continually plow enrage then demand heals.  I don't think so, sonny.  I <span style="font-style: italic">might</span> heal you once the fight is over, assuming you survive, and maybe next time (after I explain enrage to you for the 10th time) you'll move your low-AC-dual-wielding ass to the side or back of the mob . . .</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

But yeah, it's annoying when people don't know what's going on. Everytime our raid force recruits, it's obvious who is new to raiding because they usually die to enrage a couple times before they either figure it out or have it explained to them.

/cast # (1-8) Will cast the spell in that slot.
<br />

<br />
/pause will cause a pause between macro commands, and can be used on the same line as other commands. It must be used BEFORE the other commands to take effect:
<br />

<br />
/pause 30, /cast 1
<br />
/pause 30, /cast 1
<br />
/pause 30, /cast 1
<br />

<br />
This macro will cause you to cast the spell you have memorized in slot 1 with a 3 second pause afterwards 3 times.

<br />

<br />
From caster's perspective:
<br />

<br />
Don't nuke/tash/slow/heal early unless the tank is a paladin/SK tank who's good at building early agro.
<br />

<br />
Don't sit down right after nuke/tash/slow/heal.
<br />

<br />
Don't sit down when tank is about to break mez, ie, when "you gain exp" message shows up.
<br />

<br />

<br />
From tank's perspective:
<br />

<br />
If chain pulling, hit the "/assist nameOfPuller" hotkey when he/she gives the inc message and grab agro on the new mob, by casting, or arrow. Forget about the old mob if it is dying; let other melee finish it off while you build up agro on the new mob.
<br />

<br />
In addition to taunt, beg and disarm can also generate agro.
<br />

<br />
Sitting down can generate huge amout of temporary agro. This can be used a good agro grabbing and/or mob position tool. If the mob is in a wall, or chasing a caster who's running around like a chicken, try sitting down to pull the mob to you.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Eating stat food/drink does not give you that added statistic bonus, its simply having it up as next to consume that gives the stats, that way you can change the stats you want at any time.
<br />

<br />
To prevent consuming of your precious stat food, you can force feed yourself regular food/drink.
<br />

<br />
Food &amp; drink offer you a potential statistic slot for your character, but can be done from within an inventory slot of your choice.
<br />

<br />
Money has weight. Going overweight reduces your stats. Deleting the coppers you gathered up may be enough to get you back under your weight allowance.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>
