<br />
Note: This story will occure it parts , so be prepared to read for a long time before looking away from the screen, well if people even read this stuff.... in game friends say they like what i told them of this story So hope you all like it too.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Her eyes watered as she pulled at the Restraints that bound her to the wall, of the prison. Her thoughts drifted as she hung gettin weaker and weaker. every moment her life force drifted away , as if it were the ebbing tide of the ocean. Her Friend Harley had been killed in the capture of the three, Harmony had been captured and was jailed, Things were different however for Naryhn , she had given te guards a decent fight and was imprisened in the torcher chambers.  Relization hit her she would die very soon if she were to stay there much longer. Her hatred re newed as a Dark elf man stopped at the entry of her cell. He frowned and approached her. 
<br />

<br />
"They were aweful creul to you werent they"? 
<br />

<br />
"What the hell do you want?!?!?" She Snapped at him. 
<br />

<br />
"Lets see... get you the hell outta this place? It's possible you know."
<br />

<br />
"What do you mean?" he caught her attention.
<br />

<br />
He smirked. " Get you the heck outta here means you need to trust me so i might as well tell yeh my name. Its Nelven." 
<br />

<br />
"I am Naryhn, so tell me this plot of yours."
<br />

<br />
"Do you trust me?"
<br />

<br />
"Do i have a choice?"
<br />

<br />
"If you want some extent of freedom no if you dont care what the hell happens to you yes." He said this sarcastically.
<br />

<br />
She sighed." Alright i trust you." 
<br />

<br />
"Alright then, the way we do it is make them think i buy yeh for the slave trade they got going around. I heard about it from a guild mate, he bought a fresh captured girl i feel sorry for her. So i gess i can do that and take you to stay at my home till i can sneak you out of the city. Sound like a plan?"
<br />

<br />
Naryhn scowled "im not about to be bought to be your play toy!"
<br />

<br />
"Dont you listen to what i say? Im here to help you. Besides i treat women with restpect not matter what they are besides Ogre or Troll.." 
<br />

<br />
She laughed at him. "What ever. I swear try anything funny and youll be looking for a new head." he smirked at her and turned to leave.
<br />

<br />
"Will be back for you in the morning." Naryhn watched him go. 
<br />

<br />
Her thoughts rested on him. He was actully quite handsome. He had regular dark elven skin slightly paler than the average dark elf but not much.He had soft blue eyes and almost black blue hair that was about four feet long and was tied back in the same manner she had seen rangers from kelethan do their hair. He was basically a muclar elf and carried himself much like a seasoned Shadow knight. She finally went in a semi sleep and was awoken via  the clatter of armor at her cell door.
<br />

<br />
Two dark elven men unlocked her door and shackles roughly shoving her from the room and a collar was strapped tightly about her next. she was roughly pushed into a signing office she saw Nelven signing some papers, when he noticed her he grinned, it was convicing enough for the elfs. The leash was handed to Nelven and he hurried her down the steet into a complex of homes and appartments. He finally stopped at his house. 
<br />

<br />
"Sorry i had to be so rough." He muttered fimbling with the keys to the door.
<br />

<br />
"Its alright i knew you had to be convincing " 
<br />

<br />
The lock clicked and allowed them entry."Well gatta convince them a little longer till i can smuggle you out of this city, i bet you miss your home... Tell me.... What is Kelethan like?" 
<br />

<br />
He took a seat on the chair near by ready to hear what she had to say. She took a seat and cleared her throught "Kelethan... i do miss it. It is a maze and can be fusterating if you havent been there before , most of the people are good natured , the bards are always playing their wonderful songs , and the tree tops are bright and well protected , sometimes its funny to sea the rogue trainers push their recruits of the edge of the city on its low part so they can get better at safe fall." She sighed and longed for home, a solitary tear ran down her face as the fond memories flooded through her. 
<br />

<br />
Nelven whiped her tear away and put his hand on her own in a conforting manner." I see you miss your home , i know how id feel if i actully cared about this place... I'd like to see Kelethan myself but being a dark elf  i will probly not be tolerated within the city."
<br />

<br />
"Maybe i can take you there one day."
<br />

<br />
"I'd like that, if you want to wash you can upstairs."Nelven muttered "Ill take you up there if you want."
<br />

<br />
"I need to wash has been days since ive actully had a bath." She took his hand as he lead her upstairs to the bathing room. She waited outside as he got some fresh clothing and towels for her.
<br />

<br />
"There all set." he smiled at her.
<br />

<br />
"Thank you Nelven, you've been kind to me." She Kissed his cheek making him blush. then slipped into the room.
<br />

<br />
"Call me if you need me." he said through the door. 
<br />

<br />
She washed quickly and disposed of her clothig in the wash basket, not far away, She looked around the room and only saw a towel, where was the garment he got her? did he even get her one? she dried with the towel and wrapped it tight around her. She moved over to the door and peaked through she cleared her throught "Nelven got any fresh cloths here for me?" 
<br />

<br />
"Uhh yah i think. Be right there in a min." He did as promised but he was shirtless showing the mucles of his chest and arms They both blushed as the saw each other. "ill show you" he mutter shyly as she let him go through the door and he disapeared into a closet in the back of the room. he emeraged awhile later carrying what appeared to be a silver robe. "Here wear this for now." He handed it out to her. She grabbed it at the same moment releasing her grip on her towel which fell from her body as she grasped the robe. Nelven looked away his face a violet crimson. She too was crimson and she hastedly put the garment on. 
<br />

<br />
"Sorry..."
<br />

<br />
"Its okay.... my fualt.." Naryhn muttered, what a day she thought. 
<br />

<br />
"Will let you rest in guest room i gess." He lead her down the hall to a bedroom. "Be careful might be haunted said to be my gradma's aunt died in here...." 
<br />

<br />
"I hate ghosts."
<br />

<br />
He laughed at her. "Just a old family story " he kissed her cheek and moved back down the hall towards his own room "Yell if you need anything."
<br />

<br />
He left her alone standing there dumbfounded at him, dark elves are weird she thought, before slipping into the room. She slept until Vigoruos knocking at her door ."Naryhn time to go. Dont make me come in there." 
<br />

<br />
She moaned as she arose from her bed. "I'm awake alright damnit." she dressed quickly then slipped from the room, running right into Nelven who cought her in his arms.
<br />

<br />
"You okay?"
<br />

<br />
"Yes i'm fine." she said taking the collar and leash to make their act convincing enough and wrapping it about her own neck, when she was done , Nelvan dragged her from his home. The shadow  knight ran through the city quickly it was hard for Naryhn's weakened body to keep up with him. He kept a steady pase despite carrying a heavy sheild and sword, while wearing armor. 
<br />

<br />
He finally stopped in frount of a evil looking building, ghouls and dark elves guarded it , as the two crept within. the wals within were bloodstained and smelt strongly of carniege. Nelven took her into a hall way with iron doors and pushed her gently into one. mouthing "I will be back."
<br />

<br />

<br />
"Naryhn! they did get you!" one of the female occupants of the cell screeched.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Okay everyone here’s Chapter two.... Enjoy. 93 veiws so far I think I will post this! Lol! I can’t belive how many veiws this has gotten in such a short time! =) 
<br />

<br />
..........................................................................................................................................................
<br />

<br />
Naryhn turned and looked upon the face of her friend Harmony. Her clothing was tattered and torn and her face was bruised and showed signs of not sleeping in weeks, her hair was knotted and un-kept, but the hope in her eyes at seeing her friend was un-mistake-able. “Harmony! What are you doing here!?”
<br />

<br />
Harmony frowned as she answered “I was sold , as a slave to one of the dark elven men.”
<br />

<br />
Naryhn gaped and sighed “Your okay right?”
<br />

<br />
“As good as I can be my friend!” Harmony said laughing. “So, how on norrath you get here?”
<br />

<br />
Naryhn smiled and began to explain the night before happenings. “So you know anything about him Harmony?” she asked her friend.
<br />

<br />
Harmony nodded “I’ve heard from him, from the guy that bought me.... he goes to the Shadow-Knight guild , and must have cussed this Nelven guy out for hours after he apperently cut his arm off.” 
<br />

<br />
Naryhn gaped, remembering how gentle Nelven was. “So you think there’s two sides to Nelven?”
<br />

<br />
Harmony nodded , “Maybe the way you described him to me , he was pretty gentle.”
<br />

<br />
Naryhn bit her lip, and changed the subject. “ How long do these guild meeting usually last?”
<br />

<br />
Harmony Shrugged. She too changed the subject and the women talked for hours until harmony was forcefully dragged from the cell by a one armed crimson eyed elf. Naryhn passed the time examining   the cell and other women of the cage. Nelven finally came for her around a hour after Harmony left. He was Snarling with anger from a bleeding wound on his left cheek, it was festering with poison. 
<br />

<br />
Scowling he lead her back through the streets his anger continuing to grow. He kicked open the door to his own home and threw her on the couch , slamming the door. He was cussing everything in the room out. 
<br />

<br />
Naryhn looked at Nelven as he scowled at everything in the room, his festering wound was the cause of this anger. Naryhn seated next to the Enraged elf smiled sadly placing her hands on his wound. He yelping on pain but didnt tear her hands from his cheek. When she finally removed her hands the wound was gone but Nelvens anger remained and he took it out on everything. 
<br />
Hours later, Nelven's temper ceased. "Naryhn... I'm sorry..." 
<br />

<br />
"It's alright..." she said holding her left arm. 
<br />

<br />
"No it isnt... I hurt you..." he moaned as he wrapped his arms around her. 
<br />

<br />
"It's alright really.." she said her face closing in on his. 
<br />

<br />
He sighed and hugged her close as if she would leave him in a moment. She placed her hand on his cheek and kissed him, His eyes opened wide in shock but he too soon fell into the kiss. They stayed this way until finally Nelven backed away. His eyes were intense and soft . “Naryhn....”
<br />

<br />
“Yes...?” she muttered. 
<br />

<br />
“I’m taking you out of this accursed city.”
<br />

<br />
“I’m Comfortable where I am...” she muttered laying her head on his shoulder. 
<br />

<br />
“You wish to stay here?” he muttered aghast. 
<br />

<br />
She looked up into his dark face and smiled. “As long as I’m with you!”
<br />

<br />
He blushed and sighed. “ I mean I’m taking you out of here... I’ll be with you..”
<br />

<br />
She looked surprised when he said this. “You don’t like Neriak?”
<br />

<br />
“Not the least!” he howled. “I’ve always wanted to see... Kelethan.”
<br />

<br />
“Want me to tell you about it?” she asked.
<br />

<br />
He nodded. “Yah... I would like that...” 
<br />

<br />
She smiled. “Kelethan is the city of the wood elves as you probably already know. The city is in the tree tops and only ways in are Three lifts with two guards stationed at each, they watch the young children carefully as sometime Orcs attack from no where,” she sighed. “ children are easy snacks for the disgusting orcs... Anyway, all around the city you can hear beautiful music that the bards play during their spare time. It sets a cheery wonderful and calm mood throughout the city. The city itself is a large maze of ramps and bridges, you need to memorize the city or you become lost easily.” she continued to  talk about te city as Nelven listened intently.
<br />

<br />
“Sounds like a interesting place... But I doubt the guards will allow me to enter.” he muttered sadly. 
<br />

<br />
“Non-sense.... we will make sure you can enter.” she said kissing him, he wrapped his arms around her holding her close. “And I yelled at you for not trying anything! Look at me!” she said laughing. He smiled at her. 
<br />

<br />
The night continued as the two continued to talk. At dawn Nelven left her asleep on the couch, he left silently and mysteriously. Naryhn awoke and didn’t see Nelven anywhere, she smiled to herself knowing he had gone for supplies for their journey. She decided to clean his house that he almost destroyed the night before. 
<br />

<br />
Nelven returned around seven hours after he left. Behind him at the door two brown horses on their backs packs or supplies. He smiled at Naryhn who had cleaning his house tossing her a traveling cloak. “ You should wear this...” he muttered also handing her a backpack or leather armor. She nodded to him and went upstairs to change. 
<br />

<br />
Naryhn bit her lip, why did she feel the way she felt about him? Did she possibly fall in love with him? Were the feeling he invoked in her all just in her head? Or did she really love him... She slipped the traveling cloak over her new tightly fitting leather armor and slipped down the old stone steps of his home. He gave her a smile as she approached him. “We need to lead the horses through the city until we get through the front gates.” he muttered lifting her cowl over her head, then replacing his own traveling cloak. 
<br />

<br />
She nodded and followed him through the city. The front guards didn’t even bother them. They mounted their horses and rode off into the forest outside the elf city. None challenged the two cloaked riders, as they rode towards West common-lands. The two stopped riding in the West common-lands they tied the tired horses and sat against a tree side by side. Naryhn would look into Nelven’s face every now and then. Her companion showed no evidence of emotion as he ate his rations. Dusk set over the two travelers as they made camp. 
<br />

<br />
Nelven was setting his sleeping bag, and blankets out when she went over to him. He smiled up at her, when he was done. “It feels good to be free from that place...” She nodded sighed. “Something wrong?”
<br />

<br />
“No...” she muttered.
<br />

<br />
He smiled at her and hugged her close to him. He sat down on his bed with her in his arms. She looked confused at him. “Uhh.... sorry...” he muttered releasing her. 
<br />

<br />
“It’s alright!” she laughed and kissed him. He grinned at her laying himself down in his bed yawning, it had been a long day for him. She smiled laying down next to him, making him blush furiously.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">Nelven stared around the commonlands as he walked somely naryhn behind him.
<br />

<br />
"Theres freeport just up ahead." Naryhn said upon seeing the stone gates. The two walked through the crowd heading towards the docks, they boarded a docked boat waiting for it to continue with its journey.
<br />

<br />
"We'll be late, come on!" A cloaked figure shouted to her companion. 
<br />

<br />
"Shuddup!! I'm comming!" Her companion shouted back. "Who cares if were late to the God forbbin camp!" 
<br />

<br />
"Maybe, Did you think the people that are waiting for us!" The two ran up ramp to board the boat. Nelven sighed and watched the two, thinking about his earlier dream. 
<br />

<br />
"You sure your alright?" Naryhn asked him from the railing she lent against. 
<br />

<br />
"Yes, I'm fine... just been thinking...." 
<br />

<br />
"I see." She smiled at him. 
<br />

<br />
Nelven turned back to watch the cloaked figures who just boarded the boat. The female of the two removed her cowl. He stared at her.. Recongiation mirrored in his face, He felt Naryhn's look of concern. The woman he regonized looked in his direction and her jaw nearly dropped to the ground. She grinned and approached Nelven and Naryhn. 
<br />

<br />
"It's been a long time Nelven." 
<br />

<br />
Nevlen growled and looked away from her. "Yah yah so what...." 
<br />

<br />
"What brings you out here? I really thought you were going to waste your life in Neriak for the rest of your life." 
<br />

<br />
"Pfft, go bother someone else Sinharu." 
<br />

<br />
"Nelven who's this?" Naryhn asked. 
<br />

<br />
"I might ask the same thing.." Sinharu said looking Naryhn over, she grinned. "Nelven!" 
<br />

<br />
"What you want?!" he snared. 
<br />

<br />
"This girl your girlfriend?" Sinharu asked, making Nelven fall to the ground, and Naryhn blush. "Thats a yes then!" She howled laughing. 
<br />

<br />
"Sinharu.. partin' without me now?!" The secound figure asked, he hadnt removed his cowl yet. 
<br />

<br />
"Xeha I'm surprised at you... You know how much fun it is to make fun of old boyfriends!" Sinharu laughed. 
<br />

<br />
"Just don't do that to me.." Xeha said dully. 
<br />

<br />
"That was a long time ago!" Nelven growled. 
<br />

<br />
"Yup and I left Neriak because i longed for the life of adventure, Me and Xeha here are off to meet a group in Butcherblock for a Adventure that promised riches... You and your Girl friend are welcome to come Nel." Sinharu said with a grin. 
<br />

<br />
"Uhh.. we'd be glad too i gess." Naryhn smiled. 
<br />

<br />
"I'm not going to be harassed all night..." 
<br />

<br />
"Nope I'm ganna bug Xeha about his ears again." Sinharu said turning to her companion who groaned. "Come on off with the cowl..." Xeha removed it relucantly and they all saw what she ment. Xeha was elfish but he had cat ears on the top of his head and silver eyes. He also had a tail but kept it hidden. 
<br />

<br />
"Before you all laugh, youll have to know my mom was a wood elf and my dad was a Vah shir." Xeha said making them glance at one anther. 
<br />

<br />
"On wards to Butcher!" Sinharu said as she began to rub Xeha's ears. 
<br />

<br />
"You two are comical." Nelven said sitting next to Naryhn.
<br />

<br />
"O well!" Sinharu grinned hugging Xeha.
<br />

<br />
"Well I'm ganna go get some rest." Nelven yawned moving away from them.
<br />

<br />
Sinharu shrugged. "Well you guys comming Nary?"
<br />

<br />
"Yup i don;t see why not."
<br />

<br />
"Awesome!" Sinhary said back at rubbing Xeha's ears.
<br />

<br />
"If you keep that up my ears will be bald!" Xeha cried.
<br />

<br />
"Alright I'll stop!" She laughed , beginning to kiss him instead, the Vah elf rolled his eyes.
<br />

<br />
The four arrived in Butcherblock several hours later. The four walked through the mountains without a care and entered the camp they were s'posed to meet in. "There they are." Sinharu said pointing out 4 hard looking elves.
