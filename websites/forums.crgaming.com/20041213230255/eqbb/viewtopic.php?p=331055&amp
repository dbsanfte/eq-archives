No Idea what to call it...It is about 22 pages long, so will take a while.
<br />

<br />
Chapter I
<br />

<br />
His feet were rooted to the ground.  He couldn’t move, he couldn’t run.  A scream was trapped between his lips, begging to get out.  This wasn’t the time for fear, he had to move, he had to run.  With agonizing slowness, his foot slowly lifted from the ground, took a step forward, then froze.
<br />
	“Thump…thump…thump…thump…thump.”
<br />
	No!  He had gone this far, and all for nothing.  He had failed; he was going to die.  IT was going to get him, and IT was going to tear him apart.  
<br />
	“Thump...thump…thump……”
<br />
	Suddenly the sound of movement died off.  He breathed a sigh of relief.  For a fleeting second he felt at ease, he had won!  He was going to make it out.  With a strong step, he started to walk along, then slammed into a surface hard as rock.  The impact threw him backwards, and he fell to the ground, staring up into a huge, drooling shadow.  Red eyes, hundreds of them, stared from the dark passage, gleaming madly with bloodlust.  As his body was ripped apart, he had only one thought remaining, I have failed!
<br />

<br />
In the barren, dying city of Qeynos, King Soloron sat on a cracked, broken throne, where wonderful rubies, emeralds and diamonds had once lain; they now long sold to grinning merchants for a few coppers to buy swords, spears and other weapons of war.  Not that it was hard, there being barely four-hundred citizens in a city fit for hundreds, even thousands.  Less than half of them were in the Qeynos army.  If they were lucky, two or three inhabited houses stood on a cobbled road of thirty, the rest slowly decaying or falling apart.  There was no reason to loot the empty houses, for now a flask of water could sell for a bundle of rubies in Qeynos.  
<br />
Soloron stroked his jet-black beard, the beard he had been so famous for before the Great Plague, and the war that followed.  He could barely remember those times now, looking at the bleak, crumbling walls that once housed his strong city.  It was the Gnolls who had done this to him, those dog-like creatures that stood on two legs; during the climax of Qeynos he’d even felt sorry for them, having to live in the hills while the humans populated the rich farmland they had once owned.  The Gnolls had been forced into a tortured existence, their squabblings and petty battles amongst each other giving time for the Qeynos militia to separate their main force, so they would never be able to revolt and try to reclaim their lost land.  
<br />
Ahhh, yes, he thought.  I was so sure of myself then, I never thought the Gnolls would have the brains to attack us, not with all their pesky wars between each other.  Even when the Gnolls finally got together and formed two supreme clans: the Sabertooths far to the north in the nearly uninhabitable Qeynos Hills, and the Splitpaw, deep to the south in the Plains of Karana, I never doubted my army, and instead, focused on trade and the more mundane aspects of civilization.  
<br />
He remembered that fateful day very clearly, how could he not?  It was the last day of peace, the first day of Qeynos’s rapid decline - the day the scouts reported an army of Gnolls, so incredibly vast you could not see from one side to the other, or the trailing end of the army from the front; surely it had to be miles wide.  With the gates shut, and Qeynos’s great walls standing twenty-feet deep, why would he think to worry about such a force; they would all die on the walls.  It was a known fact they lacked the intelligence to create siege weapons. They were perfectly safe inside the city walls.  Or so he thought….
<br />
Instead of the mass throwing themselves against the gates, trying to break the double-thick iron grating, they stood back, and oh he had hated looking out that window, seeing the creatures that had materialized out of the swarm of Gnolls.  From then on he knew they had lost, and from then on he had entered a deep depression, so deep he had been unable to command his army during the first battles; he couldn’t have brought himself to lead those brave soldiers to their certain deaths.  Only three Ogres left the crowd of Gnolls, their fat, cumbersome bodies only a few heads taller than the surrounding warrior Gnolls, standing eleven feet tall, terribly short for the lumbering giants of thirty-feet some Ogres could reach.
<br />
But to these peculiar Ogres, size did not matter, for they did not wish to engage in combat, melee combat at least.  He remembered their wise faces, rare for any of their kind, and their probing eyes, staring into his, knowing what he knew, that Qeynos would be no more someday soon.  These Ogres were no ordinary Ogres; they were three of maybe five or six mystical shamans, who through the power of their crude magic, could elude death, the oldest ones age being deep into the thousands.  These were the leaders of the Ogre tribes, commanding the “normal” populace along the everyday tasks of pillage and looting, for in the treacherous canyons where they lived, food was scarce.  Their flowing, white beards stretched near to their stomachs, and he remembered the trance-like ways in which they moved that first day, and even from that distance he could see them dropping powders and herbs on the ground, crumbling the dirt; leaving him at a loss for words at what they were doing.
<br />
From there after the water had been poisoned, the shaman’s deadly magicks somehow tapping into the Qeynos groundwater.  That must have wiped out half of his population.  Oh how he saw those Ogres grin as the people were finally forced to dump the bodies of their friends and family over the walls, for the graves being made could not hold enough people, and the decaying bodies also spread diseases.  
<br />
After the poison had been discovered, Soloron had fresh water secretly carried in by carts from deserted farming villages nearby, via a secret, underground passage into Qeynos, built hundreds of years earlier.  It was once intended as a sewer system, but after that hadn’t worked out, it had just stayed there, unused.  Once again he had thought he solved the problem, but only days after getting the supplies of water, the shamans struck again.  This time no powders were dropped, or herbs applied, this spell was weaved by chanting and the tracing of unknown runes in the air.  That was when the people had been forced into the inner city, when the mosquitoes struck.  They were the ones who started the great plague, and that was when he had ordered his armies out of the city, although he knew it was suicide.  As a last resort to save Qeynos, he had sent more than one-half of his remaining army to try at all costs to kill the shamans.  They failed miserably, barely exiting the city gates before they were pounced upon by the Gnolls, and horribly slaughtered in front of their families standing on the ramparts.  They had practically given the outer city to the Gnolls then, for there was not enough of the army left to control the area.
<br />
Luckily for the remaining populace, the inner city was surrounded by walls, a last resort if ever the outer-city fell in war.  The mosquitoes still struck though, the people dying days after being bitten.  Soloron had had nothing to fear during the days of the plague, for in the heart of the inner city, stood a keep, and he shut himself into his royal quarters until only the uninfected stayed alive.
<br />
With a stubby quill, and a cloudy, black bottle of ink, Soloron took out a piece of parchment, and after reliving the terrible time,
<br />
(how could it have happened in only three weeks, thousands dying in only three weeks?)
<br />
began to write down the history of the war, in the chance that the armies of RiverVale, Halas or Freeport could possibly save the city, once he had been slaughtered.  But alas, just as he had set wet ink to paper, a sharp rap sounded on his door.  With a haggard face, etched in sorrow, he slowly got up, much to the dislike of his creaking back.  He had gained ten years in the space of three weeks since the plague had come; and although he only admitted it to himself in the deep hours of the night, he regretted every day of being King in this terrible war.  There were so many choices, none of them good, none of them that could help his people.  
<br />
Ever so slowly, he hobbled over to the old wooden door, and it too, seemed aged, the fine, oiled surface had turned into a splintering hulk of lumber.  His wrinkled hand
<br />
(i have wrinkles? how old have i gotten; what happened to my youth?)
<br />
grasped the metal doorknob, and slowly opened it, revealing the face of a middle-aged guard, for now the old were forced to fight – well, not quite forced – they could stand back and watch their children die in battle, although very few chose that fate.
<br />
“Your majesty, I have some bad news,” the man nearly mouthed the words, saying them for what must be the hundredth time; bad news was not a new thing to Soloron. 
<br />
“It’s not like many worse things can happen to us, Antiloch.  We are stuck here, in this prison cell of a keep, under siege from bloodthirsty Gnolls, with poisoned water, plague-bearing mosquitoes hovering outside, and three Ogre shamans probably at this minute chanting some spell to knock down our walls to the inner city.  The outer-city had already fallen to their magic!  So tell me, what is SO IMPORTANT about coming in here, disturbing my work, and telling me there is more bad news?  I’d say our luck was bad enough already, so tell me, what is it you have to say?  Please say it quickly, so I can get back to work, I have to finish my writing on the last days of Qeynos, before the Gnolls enter the royal keep!!!”
<br />
As Antiloch shrunk back, Soloron’s face softened, and he heaved a deep sigh.
<br />
“I am sorry my friend, it was not right for me to yell at you.  I just have too much weight on my shoulders, thousands of pounds too heavy.  I am already responsible for the deaths of hundreds of my populace, and near all of my army.  It will be nice when this is all over, when we lay dead in our graves, no more worries.  Now, what was the bad news you had to say?”
<br />
Taking Soloron’s apology, Antiloch began to speak”, This may be of small importance m’lord, but I have just received word that…” His voice trailed off… “Our messengers are dead.  Their heads can been seen at this very second, impaled upon rusted spears at the front gates.  We have no hope of rescue, but I doubt the Halas militia would have gotten here in time anyway.  Those barbarians to the north were our only hope, but it seems the scouts were caught and killed in Blackburrow, the Gnoll stronghold.  We had to send them via that route, or they surely would have never made it in time.  Also, across the sea, I have just gotten word that Erudin does not wish to take part in this war; they can offer no support.  I am deeply sorry m’lord.”
<br />
And with that, Antiloch quickly stepped out of the chamber, resigning himself to the knowledge of his impending death.  Well, he thought, I have lived a good life, and I knew this day would come soon; I’m not young anymore, but I just thought it wouldn’t end like this.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Chapter II
<br />

<br />
William, one of the last remaining sentries, sat atop the inner-city ramparts, staring down with horrid fascination at the line of human heads on spears, far below him, surrounded by a horde of Gnolls.  
<br />
	“Ahh,” he said to himself,” those must be the scouts sent to get help; the ones Antiloch has been talking about.  It seems they have failed in their attempt to save this dying town.”
<br />
	William shrugged off the terrible notion, he was going to die sometime, wasn’t he.  Even at the age of seventeen, he had thirty, maybe forty years to go.  Everyone would like his or her life to end later than sooner, but there wasn’t a choice here, so there wasn’t anything to worry about.  He would follow without question, even if he had a choice.  He had learned from countless battles there was always a method to the madness, although he could not usually figure it out.  The King Soloron had been good, he admitted, but now they were all going to die.  Then William had a sad thought, one of his friend, who had been one of the messengers.  Looking down, he counted the severed heads, searching for the face of his companion, Drake, then stood puzzled.
<br />
	“Hmm… one..two..three…four…..five…six?”
<br />
	He could have sworn he’d seen seven of the messengers, his friend being one of them, but his head was not mounted upon the pikes.  Maybe they had to crack his skull, maybe it wouldn’t fit on a spear, he wondered.
<br />

<br />
	Looking in on Qeynos, now with the outer-city completely taken over, and no chance of escape for the populace, Drake laughed at the stupid fools who hadn’t left back when he had, over three-weeks ago.  He had even voiced his opinion, in the presence of the King, get out while you still can!  Bah! He wasn’t going to look to Halas for help, why risk his life in Blackburrow? He had it all planned; survive in the wilderness for a time, and slowly make his way to Freeport.  By then Qeynos would be destroyed, and that tyrant of a king with it.  Good Riddance!  From there, he would start a new life, enlist in the militia, claiming he was one of the only survivors who got out of Qeynos alive.  Make up a story of his bravery - yes, in it he would save a few women and children, be proclaimed a hero, and automatically rise in standing with the Freeport army.  That would be nice, oh yes, that would be grand.  Maybe he would even be able to make his way up to a royal commander, he’d heard that happened sometimes, on account of incredible bravery.  He could liven up his story a bit, claim he killed one of those Ogre Shamans he had seen soon after leaving.  Who would know differently?  It’s not like humans pay regular trips to the canyons and deserts of the Ogre lands to their southeast, where they would be killed-on-sight by any Ogre guards or raiders.
<br />
	From his position behind an outcrop of rock, about a mile from the city walls, he could easily see the thousands of Gnolls massed inside, looting and plundering the few possessions the people had left behind, in the outer-city.  The weak army of humans didn’t stand one chance against that
<br />
	(mob, army, group, militia, too soft, !!!SWARM!!!)
<br />
	of Gnolls.  Drake was an orphan, so there was no reason for him to feel remorse, there was nobody he cared about – other than his friend.  But friends came and went, no great loss if William was killed, err… when he was killed.  Sure, he would at least ACT sad, they had been friends since birth, but now, with his new life firmly set ahead of him, there was no reason to feel remorse, change happened.  And with one last look at Qeynos, to make sure it was definitely going to fall, he trotted off on his merry way; starting the long trip west, to Freeport, not even taking a look back at the city he had lived the eighteen years of his life in.
<br />
	While trying to shrug it off, still, one thought remained, festering in the back of his mind.
<br />
	(You murderer!  You fiend!  you could save the lives of four-hundred people!  but no, you’d rather stay back, and watch the slaughter, always knowing you could stop it, always knowing all the people dying because you didn’t get help from halas.  are you scared of having your head mounted on a pole like the others drake?  are you a coward, you know sure well you would make it through.  the others were true messengers, with no experience in traveling over enemy lands, and no idea of stealth; but you have the experience, you could pull it off!  save the town, become a hero like you always wanted.  i know drake, it would be easier to go to Freeport, you wouldn’t have to risk your life, or get your hands dirty.  but remember, there's four-hundred people you could save, and your friend, william.)
<br />
	For an instant, he nearly believed the voice, for an instant he wanted to go be a true hero, not the terrible mockery of one.  But then he looked ahead, at the hardships, and although he was confident he would make it to Halas, would it be all for nothing?  Would he lead the armies back to the city, only to find it in ruins, or even worse, to not even be able to convince Halas to help?  How much of a hero would he be then?  Heck, he’d be down there with the criminals in the people’s standing, a weak messenger who couldn’t even reach Halas in four weeks, because now he was already three weeks behind the time the others had started.  No, he thought.  Let them all die, the fools!  It was their fault they didn’t listen to me; they went so far as to call me a coward who wanted to run away from danger.  I don’t care about them!  I don’t care about anybody!  All I got is myself, and that’s all I’ll need worry myself about.
<br />
	And with that, the thought was shoved deep into the far reaches of his mind, but not quite forgotten, it wasn’t going to disappear without putting up a fight.  Taking his mind off the controversial subject, he began to imagine the life of luxury, the life of happiness he was soon to have, as soon as Qeynos was overran.  
<br />

<br />
Chapter III
<br />

<br />
	Zasam, Gukaz and Gbek, the three Ogre shamans, sat together in a makeshift tent, surrounded by the vast Gnoll army.  Even on such a frosty night - winter was close-at-hand - they did not have a fire, as many of the Gnolls did.  Their magic warmed their bodies better than even the hottest fire could have.
<br />
	“Me Ogre frendz, letz us celebrat’ our near victery, and az de humie saying goez,” we killz two birdies with un’ rock, err… stone.  Deze Gnollz be wipin’ de floor wid humie’s, allz we do’z iz break de wallz down and they can barsh dem to pieces.  Then we’ze got dem Gnollz trapped, and we use our magickz to smash dem apart!  Wid all de warriors gone, we’z’ll be ablez to destroy Blackburrow and Splitpaw fortz eazy!”  Zasam nearly shouted the ending statement, standing up to make an even bigger impression.  Then he stretched out his arms, making a large circle.  “Wid de humies and de Gnollz gone, we’z will ‘ave all de land we need!”
<br />
	All three of the Ogres laughed, their tent shaking from the rumble of their fat bodies.  When the three finally calmed down, they set to talking on more urgent matters.  It was Gbek who first began to speak.
<br />
	“Dis whole plan we’z makin’ won’t gonna werk if we’z don’t kill de humies before ‘ze winter.  Dat gives us only two’z or three humie weeks to finish dem humies off, or the Gnoll’z ‘ell go back to Blackburrow and Splitpaw.  Den we won’t be ablez to barsh de Gnollz, dey too strong in their forts.  We’z gonna needz ter use all our magic and break down de wallz before it getz too cold!”
<br />
	“Yez, me agreez wid Gbek,” Gugaz said, slamming his fist down on the small, wooden table between them for effect,” We’z can’t let de winter ruin our planz!”
<br />
	Nobody of the three heard the crafty Gnoll hiding just outside the tent slip away into the night, having heard enough to talk to his master.
<br />

<br />

<br />
	Sklat the Gnoll scanned the rows of campfires, peering into the light, the bright light, it was hard to see; it hurt his eyes.  He searched for his master, the one who had send him on the spying mission.  Unlike the pesky humans, (every Gnoll’s lifelong enemy) light was a very rare item.  In the barren hills where Blackburrow was situated, the hills they had been forced into by humans, trees were scarce.  Instead, over the generations, his tribe, the Sabertooths, had developed night-vision to deal with the absence of torches and fires in the twisting caverns they had clawed into the sheer, unyielding rock.  There was an advantage to such a realm though.  Unlike walls, which could be knocked over, there was no way to enter Blackburrow, unless the high master commanded.
<br />
	Soon Sklat spotted his leader, and began to slink over towards him.  Unlike most Gnolls, he had been a runt of the litter, about the size of a human, while the average adult reached five or six paws over a human head.  His small size gave him extra stealth, which was why he had been chosen for this particular job.  Combined with his jet-black fur, (all Sabertooth Gnolls were born with it, unlike their tan furred cousins the Splitpaw) he could slip into the shadows at any time, and at night - well at night, if he didn’t want to be seen he wasn’t.
<br />
	Since he had been but a pup, the older and stronger ones had beat him into shape, his scrawny frame giving no protection to their pearl-white fangs and sharp claws.  During his first brawl, or fight, he had lost an eye to a burly, fat Gnoll, and thus got his name, Sklat, or one eye in human tongue. 
<br />
	As he approached his master, he would never even think of addressing his master by name, talking to a one of higher rank than you like that was punishable by death, the others near his master’s campfire slowly got up and walked away, knowing the next conversation was not one for their ears.
<br />
	“Hello great masssttter,” Sklat hissed,” I have important newwssss for yooouu.”
<br />
	“Ahh, my good spy.  What is the information you bring for me?”	
<br />
“It seeemsss those shamansss do not ssseek to hellpp us; I hhhearrd they plaann to kill ussss once we takkkeee out the human ccciiittyyy.”
<br />
	“Are you sure you heard correctly?”
<br />
	“Yesss, great massstterr.”
<br />
	“I knew, I knew!  Those shamans didn’t seem like the type to risk their lives to aid our cause, for a measly few sacks of gold they could have easily gotten in a day’s plunder.  Once they have outlived their purpose, I will need to arrange their deaths.”
<br />
	There was no need to say goodbye, it took too much time, time that could be spent on something else.  Sklat simply melded in with the night, and disappeared.  But the master Gnoll stayed by the campfire, soaking the in warmth, wondering what way there would be to stop the three shamans.  And even if he did stop the Ogres, had them, oh lets say, have an accident, fall on a blade that just happened to slash into their throats, how would be stop the Ogre army, probably at this minute marching towards Qeynos from Oggok, the shamans town?
<br />
	The master Gnoll, his name being Durshn, was well aquatinted with magic, he even had five Gnoll shamans under his command.  But he could tell, just from the feel of power radiating out from the Ogres bodies, his five shamans could easily die against one of them - would surely die against one of them.  His, and the Ogre shamans used the same techniques, weaved the same spells, but the strength behind Oggok’s shamans was so much more; it made him frightened.  
<br />
	What if the Ogres put on spells of protection?  What if they could tell, using magic, that Sklat had been spying on them?  What then?  For with even the crudest spell, one even a pup could learn, a blade was useless against, an army of Gnolls could be wiped out in an instant if the Ogre’s saw fit.  As with King Soloron, Durshn shared the same feeling; the weight was too heavy on his shoulders.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Chapter IV
<br />

<br />
	
<br />
	In the streets people screamed.  Soloron watched from the ramparts of his royal keep, face impassive, as a rain of Gnolls descended upon the last remaining populace of his city.  Already, three-hundred people were safely inside the keep, but the last one-hundred weren’t so lucky.  He watched the people get ripped apart, yet he shed not one tear; he was past the point of hope.  That would all be their fate, as soon as his keep fell.  
<br />
	He heard the rumors, people thought he was going insane; “just sitting there every day,” they said, “all he does is sit there and look out the window.”  In fact, he was as far from insanity as possible, he had simply resigned himself, and his people, to death.  Over time, he had realized there was no way to save the people.  Where would they go?  With an army on their backs, the children and women would never make it.  The Gnolls could run as fast as dogs; they possessed speed that seemed impossible for only two legs.
<br />

<br />
	Antiloch stood beside him, silently hoping Soloron would find some way to save the people, some way to kill the Gnolls, or at least a way to escape.  Oh, but he knew the King would never find an idea, just looking at him, he could tell.  A corpse could have a more thoughtful expression; he could tell the King was living in the past.  Probably remembering the good times of his reign, Antiloch thought, disgusted.  Just as the people need him most, he goes into a trance, just staring ahead, never blinking, growing thinner and thinner.  
<br />
	Sure, the king ate, but he did so not tasting the food in front of him, he was too absorbed in his own thoughts.  Occasionally he would utter an incoherent phrase, mouthing words from speeches he had spoke ten or fifteen years ago, or talking to old friends, long dead.  Deep-down, he felt sorry for Soloron; he had been under a heavy burden for three-and-a-half weeks now, and he had finally snapped.  Antiloch feared he wouldn’t even have lasted that long; even as a royal guard, and now the King’s advisor (the true advisors being dead) the strain was enormous.  
<br />
	But that was a fact, life wasn’t fair.  Soloron had to take the responsibility, it was his job as King, come good or bad.  As it was, Antiloch could do nothing to change the situation.  Suddenly he was interrupted from his thoughts as an old man tapped on his shoulder.
<br />
	“I am sorry to disturb you Antiloch, but you’d probably want to hear this.  It isn’t looking good, the inner-city is all but lost.  Our food supplies are dwindling, because the merchants refuse to take the sewers to such a dangerous place as our land is now.  We shall soon starve, if our problem isn’t fixed.  And now, that an early winter is upon us, we’ll never be able to get enough food to feed the populace, even if we win this war.”
<br />
	Oh how the seat next to Soloron looked inviting, Antiloch longed to just sit next to him and forget the war had ever happened.
<br />

<br />

<br />
	William was one of the remaining one-hundred who was left outside the Keep.  Just as the huge iron grating had slammed shut, William had hurled himself at the castle, but it had been to late.  It was run or die now, he thought, and neither of the options looked appealing.  If I run I die, if I stay, I die, so there isn’t even a choice (the Gnolls having an advantage of speed).  
<br />
Unsheathing his sword, he watched the charging mass of Gnolls, sometimes seeming very close, other times very far away, too distant for worry.  He stared forward for what seemed like ages, until finally the time for battle
<br />
(this isn’t battle, it’s slaughter, a million to one, now who’s gonna win? run while you still can William, take those legs and get away!) 
<br />
was at hand.  His legs wobbled, and suddenly he seemed very alone, extremely alone when he saw a large pack of Gnoll’s deter from the swarm and come towards him.  He looked around, hoping they were looking at someone else, hoping they would miss him.
<br />
(ahh no, good sir, ehh… gnoll?  don’t kill me, there’s this really nice chap, now where’s he gone too, oh yes, he’d be much more fun to kill, just follow me, but just don’t kill me, take him instead)
<br />
But there was nobody else around, nobody to go down with, no one to cover his back.  He was totally, and completely ALONE.  Now the fastest Gnoll was closing in, but time seemed to slow.  As it neared, he could make our its features, the mangy, coarse black fur, the glowing red eyes, and the fangs, the huge fangs.  They jutted out of the mouth like twin beacons, perfectly white.  He could imagine the blood staining those teeth once they were done with him.  Its arms were bulging and muscular, the sinews in the legs standing out, so that, even at this distance, he could see them.  It carried a cheap, rusty weapon, probably looted off of some poor soul’s body, and had a chest and legs covered in loose fitting leather, that looked like it didn’t belong; the creatures were closer to animals than humans.  
<br />
Now that solo runner was leading the pack, far ahead of the others, its mouth frothing like a rabid animal.  William stood still, bracing his feet, waiting for the attack that was sure to come.  The Gnoll was too eager for blood to care that its fellows were far behind; William would have only four or five swings to kill it before he was slaughtered by the others.  The deadly duel began, with the Gnoll taking wild hacks that he easily defended, using the skills he had learned upon joining the Qeynos army.  
<br />
Taking his shield, he slammed it into the Gnolls chest, but the impact left no damage, simply leaving the creature stunned.  He took this time to thrust his sword forward, aiming at the kidney.  The deadly blade moved closer and closer; it seemed to William his sword would never make it to the target.  Finally, he heard the sickening squelch as his blade met its mark, and he watched the Gnoll’s eyes bulge, its mouth twisted in fear and pain.
<br />
But no, the Gnoll would not give up; William was astonished.  He had just killed it, yet there it was, staring down on him, that rusty sword in its hand looking more dangerous than the largest cobra.  As blood rushed out of its side, the Gnoll capped the flow with a huge paw, using the other hand to use the sword and resume the battle.  Once again the animal hacked and slashed with terrible form, but now William was beginning to weaken.  For all the open places a slashing move gave, he could never find a time to attack.  The Gnoll had reached a berserk rage, one attack following the other, and all he could do was hide his body behind his shield, knowing the other Gnolls were close-at-hand.  Now sweat was flowing down his body, he couldn’t go on much longer.  
<br />
He saw the Gnoll’s face, and his heart beat a skip as it smiled at him, a smile of ecstcacy, it knowing its opponent was soon to meet its end.  As the barrage continued, William looked at the ground, his feet were practically slipping in blood.  He knew the wound would soon kill it; but how soon was the question, would he live to know?  Lowering his shield, William took the offensive; he knew it was a suicide move.  But now, the others had reached him, they were soon to join the fight; he had to finish the creature off.  One well aimed thrust would do it, he had not the time for a slash, the others were now upon him, clawing at his back behind the thin coat of chain-mail.  His blade plunged into the Gnoll’s throat, and he twisted it in anger, one would die before he was beaten into little more than a bloody pulp.  
<br />
As the limp body of his opponent slunk down to the ground, he had not the time to feel proud.  Six Gnolls were beating on him, the pain jutting in from all places, like a swarm of wasps to his aching body.  He heard the crack as his knee bent backwards, and he shifted his weight to the other foot.  His chest throbbed, and he knew more than one of his ribs was broken.  Now he felt warmth flowing from his mouth, and he coughed up a stream of blood.  As  the pain worsened, he slipped down to one knee, dropping his sword to the ground.  Fangs ripped into his arms, chewing up the unprotected flesh; the pain was unbearable.  
<br />
Blackness clouded his vision, he dropped down on his stomach, hanging onto the metal gate, begging for it to open, for someone to help him.  Next he begged to die, to stop the pain, finish him right; chop off his head, but don’t beat him to death.  Now his eyes squinted, as the skin around them puffed up, turning a sickly black.  Darkness began to close in on his vision; his fingernails were ripped and bleeding as he strove to pull himself away from the pain, to crawl away.  With his last remaining strength, he looked up, holding on to conciseness by sheer will, and saw a glimmer of steel.  
<br />
A faint twang of a bow echoed in his ears, and the clawing at his side stopped.  He heard the whistle of arrows, and the death screams of a Gnoll behind him.  But after that, he saw nothing more than darkness.
<br />

<br />
Suddenly Drake woke up.  A wave of nausea overtook him, and he shut his mouth tight to avoid throwing up.  The dream had been so real, and he wondered if he hadn’t actually been there; maybe he had sleepwalked?  No, that was impossible, he was at least fifty miles from Qeynos; it was just a dream.  He had known his friend was going to die, he had known that everyone was going to die, yet now, that he somehow knew his dream had been more than just a dream, it had happened, he felt sick.  
<br />
“How can I do this? How can I just walk out on the people I’ve known my whole life, leave them to die?  I doubt I even have a heart; I LEFT THEM TO DIE!”  The last words were nearly screamed, his face swollen and red as a few tears streamed down his face.  
<br />
After he had calmed down, and started up the fire for his meal, the sun had already began to rise from the east, and when he looked the other way from the glare, he thought he could see a little dot in the distance, Qeynos.  Over and over, almost hypnotically, as a slab of rabbit roasted on the burning flames over his fire, he coaxed himself, trying not to remember the dream; the blood, the gore, all the people being mercilessly slaughtered.
<br />
“Re-re-remember…it was jus-just a dream.  Nothin’ to worry about, I’m-I’m just fine…s-safe here…heh heh… nothin’ to worry about – just a dream…”
<br />
The words felt false and hollow coming out of his mouth.  He still wanted to go to Freeport badly, there was nothing left for him in Qeynos, so he hung on to the only fact he could, it was just a dream.  
<br />
“I’ll bet there’s some bandits waiting for me over there,” he whispered to himself, pointing east, towards Freeport, two-hundred miles away.  I guess I’ll just have to go north for a while, to elude them.”
<br />
(north maybe, to Halas?  so you’re going to finally give in, now that the cities in ruins, the army will never make it in time.  and you know why they won’t make it, because you never reached them when you should have; it’s too late now Drake, just give it up and go to Freeport, start a new life.  you don’t need those people, remember, you warned them a long time ago to leave.)
<br />
Oh how he hated the thoughts in the back of his mind.  They never agreed with him, on anything.  Anyways, he wasn’t going to Halas, he just needed to get past those bandits
<br />
(bandits! bah! you know there are no bandits there, just another excuse, you never face the truth)
<br />
that were sure to ambush him if he went past that clump of rocks.  After walking north for what seemed like a good hour or two, he turned east again and kept along his path for Freeport.  But he made sure he didn’t turn all the way east; and although his mind wouldn’t admit it, he was going slightly north also.  
<br />

<br />

<br />
Chapter V
<br />

<br />
	The three Ogre shamans celebrated the winning of the inner city, feasting on a huge pile of food they had accumulated from the human houses.  Many Gnolls stared at the feast hungrily; there was not near enough to feed the mass of their army.  Already many ribs were showing, and emancipated bodies were not uncommon.  Most were ready to give up the siege until spring, but the great master of the Splitpaw forbade them leave until the first snow.  Tension was high between the two clans; and the Sabertooths were ready to leave if matters didn’t improve, namely, a change of leadership.  
<br />
	The Gnolls of Blackburrow did not like having Kutarune of the Splitpaw in total command of both tribes.  Then there was the matter of doling out land, after Qeynos had been taken.  Durshn of the Sabertooths had a larger number of Gnolls, and thus wanted more of the land, which the Splitpaw vehemently declined.  There were casualties on both sides from fighting, and a slight shift had occurred, the two tribes splitting apart from each other, a ten or eleven paw separation between the two camps.  This was the main trouble on Zasam’s mind as he sat down to the huge feast, the rolls of fat lining his stomach jiggling appreciatively.  
<br />
	“We’z got a big problem on our’z planz if de Gnollz break away,” Zasam started, lowering his voice so the surrounding Gnolls couldn’t hear.  “If dey go back to Blackburrow or Splitpaw, we’z ‘ell never be ablez to kill ‘em.  Dat’s what they’ll do too, if dey’z a start barshin each other.  We should kill dem right dis very minute, but it’s impossible.  We won’t be ablez to get enough power back for at leazt two weeks to destroy the whole army, and by den winter will ‘ave came and de Gnoll’z ‘ill leave.  Dat iz, unless dey have some type of shelter to keep warm in.”
<br />
	“I don’t know howz we’z are going to do dat,” Gbek replied,” de Gnollz plan waz to leave when it snowz.  De dumb Gnollz burned all de humie houses down, so dere is no place for dem to stay.”
<br />
	“Dat is true Gbek, unless we’z get de big humie keep over dere.”  Gukaz pointed to the center of the inner city, the last refuge for the remaining two-hundred-fifty people; a small castle.
<br />
	After some time of thought, Gbek spoke up again,” We’z won’t be ablez to knock down de castle until our strength is back up, dat magic weakened us lotz.  It will take us a week to get stronger, and by den da first snow may have come.”
<br />
	“Well, dat iz de only choice we have, just letz hope no snow comes,” Zasam said, ending the conversation.
<br />
	And with that, they resumed their meal, gorging down the piles of dried and salted hams, freshly-cooked corn, day-old bread and butter-coated squash.  It was indeed a meal fit for a king; freshly plundered from the inner-city, where the populace had not the time to bring any of their belongings.  As Sklat brought in the Ogres a “dessert,” (freshly roasted human arms and legs, covered in a myriad of spices, on top of a large, steel platter - one of an Ogres favorite foods) he smiled, then tipped a small bag of unknown powder into the juices surrounding the meat.  This should end our worries, he thought.
<br />

<br />
	After giving the dish to the now dead-drunk Ogres, he slipped away into the night as was common; then found his master around the customary camp-fire.  
<br />
	“I have done my deeed oh great massster,” he hissed.
<br />
	“Ah, good – it is nice to have a Gnoll around who can actually do something correctly.  If you keep this work up, you will be sure to rise quickly in the clan.  That powder will act very quickly, and come midnight they shall be sound asleep.  With the concoction’s aid, they will be even drowsier than usual, giving time for you complete my next task.”  Handing Sklat a keen-edged, glimmering scimitar, he went on,” This blade has been with the Sabertooths for many a century, even before the humans came to be.  I shall use it on the King Solomon to end his life, and I expect you will do the same with the sleeping Ogres.  Make sure to bring me their heads, for then I can show the Splitpaw what we do with our enemies.”
<br />
	Issuing a low laugh, Sklat slowly ran his fingers over the sharp blade, drawing lines of blood across them.  “Thisss blade isss very sharp, I will nottt fail you masssster; by morning the Ogres headsss will be in your tent.”
<br />
	Even with Sklat, his most trusted assassin, out to kill the shamans, he was still uneasy.  The whole plan would fail if the Ogres became sober enough to cast spells of protection; that was why he had chosen this occasion to give them the gift of the Gnolls favorite brew, Blackburrow stout.  But if it wasn’t enough, the only fallback was his shamans, which he had little trust in.  There was no going back now, though.  Unless the shamans were destroyed, the Ogres would undoubtedly destroy them, barring they fled back to Blackburrow, which he didn’t intend doing.  In honest battle, the Gnolls would win by sheer numbers, but with the shamans the tide turned, for the worse.
<br />

<br />
	The pearly orb of the moon shone brightly in the dark; enough to see quite well for midnight.  An expanse of clouds hovered to the east, streaks of gray across the black background of the night.  All of the Gnolls bonfires were out, and all slept soundly but the night-watch, on both sides.  Little more than a spot of black, creeping stealthily through his clan’s camp, Sklat went about his important deed, taking his time - relishing the moment.   
<br />
	Between the two, now apprehensive Gnoll encampments, stood a bulbous tent, its size many-times larger than the average, to encompass the huge, Ogre bodies.  Sklat cautiously peeled open the tent flap, the coarse fibers of cloth sticking statically to his fingers.  Just as he was to step into the crude tent, he froze, listening intently as Zasam rolled over, then began a steady snore.  Silently tiptoeing into the room, Sklat closed the tent flap, until the place was completely dark, at a time when a human wouldn’t be able to see its hand in front of its face.  As his eyes adjusted to the absence of light, he drew out the long, curved scimitar, brandishing it in his left hand.  Peering at the faces, he wondered which to take out first.  He’d need to do it quickly though, for if the Ogre didn’t die fast enough, it was likely to wake its fellows.  A quick slice to the throat would work; and when done fast enough, he could get them all before the first one died.  
<br />
	He decided on Gukaz, who was in the left corner, far from the others.  Even if he squirmed, there wasn’t much of a chance the Ogres would wake; he had given them an extra-heavy dose of the sleeping powder, made by the Gnoll shamans.  With a smile the Ogre would never see, Sklat began to lower the keenly edged blade towards Gukaz’s throat.  
<br />

<br />

<br />
Chapter VI
<br />

<br />
	William awoke, groggily wiping his eyes, wondering where he was, and what had happened.  Purple and black bruises covered his entire body, and a tight roll of white, cloth bandages wound about his left leg.  As he moved to sit up, a shudder of pain wiped across his chest.  He sucked in his breath tightly, and slowly exhaled as the pain dulled.  From the feel, at least three ribs were broken; a few others probably cracked.  His leg was obviously broken too; but other than that, it was just welts and bruises.  
<br />
	Looking around, he recognized the bed he lay in as one in the castle infirmary; and that indeed, was where he was.  All around him, people sat or slept in the beds; many of them covered in grisly battle wounds.  Gradually turning, to avoid the ache of his ribs, he spotted an oak staff propped against his bed.  It was of rather fine quality, weathered by old age, and he found it would do nicely.  With the aid of the walking stick, he was able to thrust himself out of the bed, (which he longed to stay in) while keeping the weight off of his injured leg.  
<br />
	Hobbling like a man more than twice his age, he stumbled towards the door, to see how the battle had progressed.  Opening the door with a creak, he nearly ran into a man coming from the other way.
<br />
	“By god, you have suffered greatly”, the man said, looking at the broken leg and plethora of bruises.  “Let me get you back into bed, you dearly need your rest.”
<br />
	As the man began to lead him back to the bed he had so recently got up from, William resisted.  “I’ll be fine, but thank you for your concern.  How has the battle gone; did we lose the inner city?”
<br />
	“I’m afraid so, this castle is all we have left.”
<br />
	“I see, hmmm…”  He didn’t like the way things were going.  “Do we have any way to get out of here, then?  This keep is a lost cause, it won’t hold them for long.”
<br />
	“You are wise beyond your age young man; although there is no way out, other than the sewer.  We are completely surrounded.  If we could get to the boats fast enough, it is possible we could escape overseas to Erudin, but as it stands, a large number of Gnolls guard the dock.  We would be slaughtered in seconds if we attempted that feat.  Now, if you’ll excuse me, I must finish my errand for the head council.”
<br />
	“Head council?  What about the good King Soloron?  Is this mutiny?”  William looked baffled.
<br />
	“I see you have been out for a long time; King Soloron had entered a depression.  He is unable to function in his duties as King, so a council has replaced him, with Antiloch as the head.  Right as we speak, the people are coming to the great hall to have a meeting.  If you hurry up, I’m sure you’ll make it on time, although I would rather you stay in bed.”
<br />
	“I’ll go along, maybe somebody will come up with a way to save this dying town.”  And with that, William strode off to the great hall, leaving the man to his task.
<br />

<br />
	The sun had just begun to cast its golden rays across the dew-filled grass, when Drake woke up.  As he cleared his eyes, he was again astounded by the beauty of the pleasant valley he had had the pleasure to come across.  All around him, a mellow, light-green grass flourished – the coarse fibers growing in thick patches where there was open sunlight.  Interspersed throughout the valley, huge willows towered like guardian sentinels, keeping watch over the fragile landscape.  Their massive size and plethora of thin, drooping, albeit healthy branches were a testimony to their age, which Drake guessed to be in the thousands.  
<br />
	Out in the open, squirrels, hares and birds grazed (or flew) about the area, unconcerned for their safety.  No predators had ever entered the sacred realm.  After eating a bland meal of dried, unsalted meat (he didn’t have the heart to kill any of the creatures in the valley, nor did he want to attempt to cut down one of the monstrous trees) he packed up his few possessions, amounting to little more than a blanket, lantern and backpack, then set off for another day of travel towards Freeport.  Unlike the past few days, his step was brisk and hearty, and he was filled with a sense of peace as he mounted the first slope, and began the downward trek.  
<br />
	After a few steps, he froze and stared.  His first thought was of moles, but after looking at the burrows he judged them far too big to be that.  Hundreds of strange-looking earthen mounds, topped with a layer of thick grass stood in a wide depression of land – wide enough to hold the populace of a human city.  As he came closer, his thoughts changed.  Was this some kind of perverse joke?  From a distance the size was hard to judge, but now, he could see the shelters (or whatever the mounds were) clearly.  
<br />
	Crude, wooden doors, fashioned stoutly but with no sense of beauty, blocked in inside of the mounds from view.  They were sloped with the mound, and nearly stood parallel to the ground.  But what caught his eye was not the look of the doors, but the knobs.  They were tiny, along with the doors, and the mounds themselves, fit for a child, and a short one at that.  Fear swept over him as he realized it was not a human town; and if it wasn’t a human town, the occupants may not be as friendly as he had suspected.  His heart beat a skip as a creak sounded to his far left, and a door opened.  He froze, and watched silently, as a tiny head poked out of the top, very humanlike, but still with a few differences.  As it spotted Drake, the door slammed with a thud, and the head disappeared from view.  Then, after a few tense minutes, the creature opened the door once again, and stared once more.  Deciding it was safe, it fully exited the mound, and said something in a language Drake didn’t understand.  A few seconds later, the thought hit him.
<br />
	A halfling!  From his weak knowledge he had amassed over his lifetime, he remembered a little figure from Qeynos.  He had been only a child then, but he could still see the picture clearly – stubby arms and legs, a high voice, it had to be one of the things that lived here!  By now, many more halflings had come to look at the creature that was equally strange to them, along with another that seemed slightly taller.  Judging from the expensive silk and polished boots, Drake decided it was their leader. 
<br />
A minute later he found out he was right.  In the human language, the halfling began to speak.
<br />
“Hello human.  I know my accent is terrible, but I think you will still understand me.”  Drake nodded his head in answer.  With the effect feeling much like slamming into a wall, another thought came together in his head.
<br />
(you can get the halflings to help you!  think about it!  you can be a true hero!  just send them over to qeynos, and save the city!)
<br />
He thought about it for a few seconds, then came up with his choice…
<br />

<br />

<br />
Chapter VII
<br />

<br />
	Sklat kneeled down on the ground, right beside the Ogres sleeping body.  Gukaz was flat on his belly, breathing heavily through his nose, completely asleep.  Sklat angled his scimitar towards the Ogres throat, body poised to give the deadly blow.  After a flash of steel, a long, red line covered Gukaz’s throat.  The blade dug in, until the Gnoll pulled it out, feeling it sufficient enough to kill.  Instead of the body going limp, as Sklat had suspected, the Ogre sat up, gasping for air, and began to go berserk.  
<br />
	Sklat cursed, he had only severed the windpipe, the others were sure to wake.  With the vocal cords cut, the Ogre could not scream, but made up for it in the racket it caused by its squirming on the ground.  Boxes and powders and herbs flew in all directions as Gukaz writhed in agony, his mouth constantly trying to breathe air.
<br />
	Suddenly Zasam woke up.  His eyes felt heavy, and from his experience in alchemy, the first thing that came to mind was that this was something more than just tiredness.  As he saw a glimmer of metal in the darkness, the adrenaline started pumping, and he became fully awake.  Blood smeared nearly everything in the whole tent, and Gukaz was flopping on the ground like a fish out of water.  With a scream of rage, Zasam hurled himself at Sklat, pinning the Gnoll to the ground, and snapping the scimitar in half like a twig.  Although Zasam was not a warrior, he still possessed incredible strength, and his bodyweight alone could keep the Gnoll on the floor.
<br />
	An instant later Gbek was up too, weaving spells of protection over the two of them in the chance that other Gnolls were coming.  Behind the chants and rhythmic humming of Gbek while he went through the spell, Zasam slowly strangled Sklat, twisting his hands tighter and tighter around the Gnoll’s neck.  After two full minutes, a choked scream sounded, accompanied by a sharp crack as Zasam broke his neck; he getting tired of the torturous game.  
<br />
	Hefting up the Gnoll by its side, the two shamans stormed out of the tent, leaving Gukaz’s lifeless body behind.  Holding Sklat’s corpse high in the air, the eyes glazed over and starting to cloud, Zasam yelled.  
<br />
	“WHO SENT AN ASSASIN!”  The booming voice echoed throughout the entire camp, instantly waking the Gnolls (they are extremely light sleepers).  On both sides, (Splitpaw and Sabertooth) the Gnolls looked baffled, other than Durshn in the far back, who hissed curses under his breath.  Suddenly a Splitpaw Gnoll stood up, the tribe leader, Kutarune.
<br />
	“That Gnoll had black fur, it was not one of us, as you can see we are tan.  It is them, the Blackburrow who have attacked you, and now they will pay!”  With a wave of his hand, Kutarune motioned his army to attack.  As the Gnolls picked up weapons and charged towards their new enemies, Kutarune screamed all the way.  
<br />
“DEATH TO THE SABERTOOTHS!”
<br />
	A huge battle erupted between the two clans, both sides hacking and slashing in deadly combat.  The Sabertooths easily outnumbered the Splitpaw, and it showed distinctly as the battle progressed.  Howling with rage, the two Ogres attacked the black-furred Gnolls, using all their strength into doling out death.  Twisting vines erupted from the ground, grabbing onto Gnolls and ripping their bodies apart.  As Gbek’s power increased, the vines turned a green-black, and began to grow thorns.  More and more sprouted from the soil, erupting in a shower of dirt and instantly seeking their victims.  Zasam sent blasts of ice into the horde, the sharp icicles ripping and tearing into unprotected bodies, staining the ground with blood.  Then, thoroughly exhausted, they slumped down onto the ground, and watched the battle progress, the sides now evenly set, due to the shaman’s magic.
<br />

<br />
	During the middle of the night, Antiloch was suddenly awakened.  A watchman burst through the door, wildly shaking him until he was spurred into action, quickly dressing and then listening.
<br />
	“Sir, sir,” the watchman was very excited to get his point across,” there’s a big battle going on.  I think you should see this; it’s the Splitpaw and the Sabertooths.”
<br />
	Meanwhile, the other watchmen woke others, until the whole populace was staring from the ramparts, at the ensuing clash below.  Even in the night, with only a few lanterns, the moon let the people see the grisly scene.  Clumps of bodies lined the area like grass in a field, and yet more and more Gnolls came, fighting madly with bloodlust; it was kill or be killed.  
<br />
	Even Antiloch stared, goggle eyed, momentarily forgetting his duties as a sort of backup-king.  It was William, who first realized the importance of the battle, for he was slower than the others, and thus didn’t get to the side of the castle where the battle was as quickly.  Hobbling at a rapid pace, he came upon the ramparts facing east, then began following the others south to where the Gnolls were.  It wasn’t movement that caught his eye as he moved south; it was closer to the lack thereof that spurred his thought.  Suddenly, he got it.  Looking at the docks, where lines of boats were moored, he saw no Gnolls. 
<br />
	“THE SEWER!”  He screamed, trying to attract people.  But there was nobody else, they had all gone on, and he wasted precious seconds limping on over to the others; they being very far away now that he was slowed to a crawl with his injury.  Finally, he reached the people, and picked Antiloch out of the crowd.  After conversing for a few seconds, he too realized the idea.
<br />
	“Everyone, follow me!”  Antiloch ordered,” We are going to try to leave!”
<br />
	The people were only too happy to go, and they quickly followed Antiloch as he began to descend the first flight of stairs on their path to the bottom of the Keep, leaving William behind.  He didn’t mind though; it would be foolish for them to risk their lives in order to keep pace with him.  Luckily, he knew where the sewers were, and dutifully began the trek to them.
<br />

<br />

<br />
	
<br />
	Antiloch led the way, down, down, down until they finally reached the ground, four flights of stairs later.  Inside the great hall, he took a passage to the right, then opened a little-used trapdoor revealing yet another stairway beneath.  The air inside smelled musty and damp; he wondered when the trapdoor had been last opened, but then shooed the thought away.  He had more important things to do.   He stood aside as the one-hundred-fifty or so of his populace entered the stairway, then followed behind.  
<br />
	What they encountered at the bottom of the stairwell was not a sewer in that sense - more of an underground passageway.  It had never been used once, for some reason it had been abandoned a long time ago.  Moss lined the stone walls, and the passage was extremely cold.  The people moved closer together to take advantage of their combined body-heat, then moved forward.  It took over fifteen minutes to finally exit the sewer, but to Antiloch it seemed to measure in the hours.  Totally cut-off from the surface, he wondered if the battle was still raging, or had they put their weapons aside to face a common enemy, the humans?
<br />
	Soon enough they breathed the refreshing air on the surface, now deep into the outer city, very near the docks.  First the men rushed to the boats; methodically loading on the women and children until there stood seven boats with about twenty people to each.  Just as the ships were to set off, towards Erudin, (across the sea) William crawled on, then sat down, exhausted.
<br />
	He talked to Antiloch as the boats left their moorings, the night-wind propelling them slowly west, across the placid water.  
<br />
	“We’ve done it!  We’re saved,” Antiloch expressed his words in sheer joy.
<br />
	But William, watching the Gnolls still fighting on the shoreline, wasn’t so sure.  “We’re not saved until we dock at Erudin.”
<br />

<br />
	Zasam and Gbek sat motionless along the shoreline, their energy thoroughly tapped from the use of their powerful magic.  Rage boiled inside Zasam’s body; the traitorous Sabertooths had killed Gukaz, and revenge would be swift, as soon as they got some of their power back.  Where they rested now was safe, for the Splitpaw Gnolls had angled the battle away from them.  Panting heavily, Gbek began to slowly close his eyes, then froze.  
<br />
	A brief flash of movement from behind the far corner of his left eye made him stand up.  Zasam stood up too, and followed his line of sight.  A procession of human boats slowly made their way out to sea, the hulls so dark they could not be distinguished from the surrounding night; only the slight movement of the white sails could be seen.  
<br />
	“We must not dem get away!”  Zasam shouted over the screams and yells of the Gnolls.  Quickly, before the boats could get out of sight, Gbek chanted a few words.  Suddenly the wind picked up, and the waves began to get choppy, rocking the ships back and forth, nearly capsizing one.  The wind blew harder, and Gbek kept chanting, his voice growing louder and louder, as the choppy surf turned into waves, and the wind into a hurricane.  Clouds drifted over, instantly turning from puffy-white, to a menacing black, dumping rain over the ships as if they were under a waterfall.  Already, sweat was pouring down Gbek’s body; he knew he couldn’t go on to much longer, probably not long enough to sink the boats.
<br />
	As Gbek began to stumble, and drop down to his knees, the spell weakened, and the wind started to slow.  Zasam saw this, and began to help.  Lowering the shielding spell he had been keeping up since they had left the tent, he dropped a few herbs from his pouch on the ground.  While he traced runes and symbols in the air, the ground began to shake.  By now the hurricane had completely stopped, and Gbek lay gasping for air at Zasam’s feet.  Everywhere the battle seemed to halt, and all stared at the ground; by now it had picked up to an earthquake.  Gnolls who lost their footing were tumbled onto the ground, falling into others on their decent.  
<br />
	The ships were nearly washed into shore by the huge waves generated, the underside of the hulls scraping against the bottom.  Now, more than two feet into the deep mud, the ships stood motionless in the shallow water; only the top deck above the raging waves.  Using his last remaining energy, Zasam began to administer the deadly blow, as lightning rained from above.  The huge, yellow bolts arced down from the sky above, slamming into the ground and water; just a few steps from the grounded boats.  
<br />
	While most of the people had taken cover, and crawled down into the bottom, fifteen men suddenly went up, staring intently at the two Ogres.  With a horrified glance, Zasam realized his mistake, and began to run.  His back was an easy target, and a flock of arrows rained down on his flesh.  The shaman slumped to the ground dead, his eyes wide, and his mouth twisted in pain.  The lightning instantly disappeared, and the water became still, once more.  Gbek screamed as arrows bit into his throat, entering his chest, ripping into his arms and legs.  With a sickening gurgle, he too, fell to the ground.  Kutarune saw the two Ogre corpses, and screaming with rage, urged on his tired warriors.  Getting a second wind, the Splitpaw Gnolls surged forward, trampling any Sabertooths in their path.  Blades glittered as they danced their deadly dance, strewing entrails and bloody lumps across the scarred and cratered battlefield.   Slowly, the fighting wound down, as the final Blackburrow Gnolls were rounded up and slaughtered – the Splitpaw showed no mercy to traitors.  
<br />
	A gigantic circled had formed around one body, it beaten to a bloody pulp but still breathing.  Durshn gasped for air as he stared at the laughing Gnolls, watching him with red, glowing eyes.  The circle slowly closed in, one step at a time, then stopped.  From the ranks of the Splitpaw, a single figure strode out, and all the Gnolls lowered their heads in reverence.  
<br />
	“I stand here, next to the leader of the Blackburrow,” – Kutarune laughed – “or what’s left of him.  Durshn, we have seen your treason, and must now enact punishment.”  Lifting his clawed foot into the air, Kutarune kicked Durshn until he was face-up.  The leader of the Sabertooths could do nothing; he was too beaten to care about the pain, and was just barely holding onto consciousness.  Blood dribbled out of his mouth in a small stream, pooling on the rock and gravel.  Again, Kutarune laughed.
<br />
	“Look at this miserable…thing!”  Kutarune laid his foot to rest on Durshn’s neck, and slowly began to apply pressure.  Durshn’s eyes bulged, and he coughed up blood in a choked scream.  Kutarune shifted his weight more, relishing the moment of his opponent’s slow death.  "Is this all the fight the “mighty” leader of the Blackburrow is going to put up?”  Then he looked at Durshn.  “You foul little weakling!  You corpse shall be left to feed the cr-.”  Kutarune’s eyes rolled back, and he flopped to the ground, a thin arrow lodged in his throat.  Many Gnolls did the same thing, as a stream of such projectiles erupted from the east.  
<br />

<br />
	William stared from one of the ships, looking at the mass of people that had so unexpectedly come from the east.  As the Gnolls savagely fought the unknown warriors, he stood puzzled.  Children, fighting a war?  No, something was wrong.  After a few minutes of watching, he suddenly understood.
<br />
	“Halflings,” he yelled, so that the other boats could hear,  “have come to save us!”
<br />
	Everybody cheered and watched yet another battle progress, and they could easily see who was to be the victor.  The exhausted Gnolls stood no chance against the well-rested halflings, and they were swarmed and killed.  Human archers picked off any Gnolls that happened to step within range; their arrows whistling through the air as they flew towards their targets.  After only a half-an-hour, the Gnolls began to retreat, their numbers down by thousands.  The halflings followed close behind, killing the lagging ones as they fled to the south.  	Just as the battle ended, William looked up into the sky, and thought he saw a spec of white.  Staring intently, he picked out a few more, as they descended from above.  
<br />
	“’Tis the first snow of the winter, and the Gnolls have been defeated,” he said to himself, broken leg and ribs completely forgotten.  He lifted his face towards the sky, and felt the snowflakes brush against his skin, oblivious to the cold.  The burden of the long war lifted from his soldiers, and, unbeknownst to him, the same happened with Drake.  
<br />
	
<br />
	At the rear of the army, a few halflings carried huge packs, laden down with blankets and food.  As Drake watched the supplies be given to the citizens of Qeynos, he felt a wave of peace wash over him.  I have finally done it, he thought.  It took awhile, but I finally became a hero!
