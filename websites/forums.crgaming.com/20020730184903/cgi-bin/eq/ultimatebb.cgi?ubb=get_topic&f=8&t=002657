Hmm. If you are going to do the raid scene, I would not go for either of these classes. Both are not much wanted. Warrior, Enchanter, and Cleric are the way to go. The holy trinity, as it were. Next in line are rogues, monks, SKs and wizards for damage. Then we have the dribble. hehehe...slight exageration.<P>Both necro and magician classes rely heavily on their pets. Well, necros will be able to go petless when they get their root spells. Necros have many options to deal with adds. Magicians don't. Most importantly, necros have Feign Death. It saved me several times. <P>I've got a gnome necro. I can go to several cities without being aggro'ed upon. *shrug* Necros are only masters of soloing until 50. There are other classes that can out-solo necros after that. <P>Ok, the research aspect of int casters. You don't have to do it if you don't want to. All the servers are old enough that you can get someone to combine the words for you to a spell or you can buy the spell off someone. Personally, I didn't do any of the research stuff. I just bought all my spells. <P>Well, those are my thoughts anyways.

But after that they drop off quite considerably.  Really being evil only matters for the first 10 levels or so, in relation to getting killed that is.  After invis ect there is no problem getting around guards and such, plus w/ FD your golden.  However you most likely will never get the same freedom you will experience as a magician.  <BR>      Magicians are very limited in what they can do.  They are very pet dependant, so much that at most levels a dead pet means a dead mage, unless you have jboots or sow.  Now mages make much better group players and are even better in raids, although not the greatest.  If you want to walk into a dungeon and get a group instantly, make a cleric or enchanter.  If you want a group w/in 15 mins make a warrior/rogue/tank, if you want a group after about 1 1/2-2 hours, make a necro or mage.  Both aren't near the top of the "must have" list.  If I had to start over, I'd go w/ a mage personally.  Better pets, better dds, better faction, no worries about stocking up on 150 food/drink.  Overall for me, who likes to group rather htan solo, a mage makes a better match.  However if you want to solo almost exclusively from 1-50 make a necro.  Its a tought decicions, but I would say mage for you.  Alot more user friendly.<P>--------------------<P>Nefar i'Ous: Former lvl 54 Necromancer of Innoruuk.

In my humble opinion i prefer the necro over the mage because they're soo damn versatile. If you go with the mage, keep in mind that you have a pet, you nuke and coh. That's pretty much what the mage does. While nice nukes, the best pet in game and coh are usefull, this is only what you're going to do. If you prefer quick offensive spells with an uber pet go with the mage.<P>"Now, here's what I like about the magician.<BR>The main thing, is that they are a good class.

When a mage is being attacked and he doesnt have a pet, his only way out is either RUN or GATE, unlike the necro that can gate, run, FD, mez, harmshield, root, snare, fear.<P>You will like the mage for it's rapid offensive ability.<BR>You will like the necro for his versatility, imo necro's have more options then the mages especially when things becomes dangerous.<P>Spherik Darksavant<BR>Warlock of Sanctuary, 7th hammer

well, both classes are dependant on their pets...when soloing. in a group, even without a pet, a mage has the second best dd spell in the game.<P>necros are more versitile, and have more ways of avoiding death, teh faction issues are easy to get around, unless you like pain and make a iksar. and faction means nothing in kunark and velious.<P>necros solo better then mages. necros die less.<P>mages are more sought after in groups. they have very good dd line, which every one seems to be ignoring. and COH is a great spell. with the new expansion, mages are getting a GROUP ANTI SUMMON spell. this spell will be HUGE in the high end game. through in teh anti fear for their pets, they are very good at higher lvls.<P>necros are absiolutly not sought after for groups period. you will get invited if you shout long enough, so make alot of friends early.<P>if you want to solo mostly, and the post 50 game is not that important to you, play the necro, they are alot of fun, and they rock in an outdoor group.<P>if you want the high end game as well, and plan on grouping alot, play the mage, life will be less fustraiting for you.<P>if you want people sending you tells to come join their group, play a chanter or cleric. you can go anywhere. chanters are very versitile too, and they solo as well as a necro, better in dungons. chanters have a very good pet and fear too. my low lvl chanter pulls with a dot, gets teh pet aggroed on the mob, and fears it. a couple of blasts and its over. at lvl 14 i can do 4 blue mobs befor i need to med. and their is no better class for adds. chanters mostly play in groups, mainly cause when you log on, you get several tells right away, but they mostl certaionly dont have too.<P>--------------------<P>Lebie of the Rathe

<BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>well, both classes are dependant on their pets...when soloing.<HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Not true.  Magicians are dependant on their pets...necromancers can operate just fine without one.<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>I really like the pet parts of both these classes. How they use pets as dummies and to get the mobs aggression on the dummy and the pc can cast away.<HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>It's a little more complicated than that for magicians, but not much.  Necromancer pets are not tanks though; a necromancer fears the monster, sends in the pet and casts their DoTs.  The pet can take a small beating, but not until level 49 can the pet "tank" anything for more than a few seconds.<P>One thing I'm surprised nobody's mentioned is the downtime.  Magicians have a lot more downtime than a necromancer, with no way to heal and no way to gain back mana.  Necromancers have a minimal amount of downtime with their lifetaps and lifetap DoTs to maintain health and the Lich series of spells to gain back mana.<P>As much as I like my necromancer, I wish he were a magician of equal level so I could have a magician epic.  Their epic is, in one word, awesome.  However, I would never care to play a magician through 50+ levels...there just isn't enough variety for the class.  Spherik has it right, cast a DS, send pet and nuke.  That's all a magician does.<P>If you don't mind the downtime, are concerned about the faction issues, and want to have a challenge: choose the magician.<P>If you hate downtime, don't care about the faction issues and want a class that can survive well and is (arguably) easy to play: choose the necromancer.<P>--------------------<P>"...you've been given the reason which can distinguish between good and evil, and you've been also given free will; this may meet with difficulties at first, but it wins everything in the end, if it's fed with virtue..." – Dante Alighieri, <I>The Divine Comedy: Purgatorio</I>, XVI, 73-78

I would choose a Necro over a Mage to play anyday of the week and twice on Sunday.  Mages are a fine class but the extra deversity of our spell list is a huge advantage over a Mage's abilities.<P>But I do have to say that Mage uber pet is a dream pet.<P>Bril

Taniwhat lol nothing can compete with resistance on Scent line (as well as argo - only CoC have higher taunt) as for shamans Malo line - it's have very very low resist if any - much like necro life drains... While Malo lvl 60 is true lure debuff and lower resist on 45 - while necro dont have ANY irresistible spells (except enslave death which about as usefull as infusion)

forrin,<P>if you do not plan to raid alot (what will be very hard later in the game), then go for the necromancer.group in the earlier part of your career to learn your spells..its just not enough to see the spells stats in spoilersites.you have to cast them and make own experience with them..like someone with the post 50 pets <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0">.a necro, if well played, adds alot of things into a regular xp-party.<P>if you plan to raid alot (what you WILL do later in the game), then go for the mage.mages are NOT just coth-slaves in raids like some people think.<P>they have:<P>-powerfull non-magical dds, which they can land on ALOT of bossmobs after a debuff.<P>-good pets, which have different immunities..so they can use them against most of the bossmobs in combination with the fear-buff for their pets.<P>generaly, a mage adds much more into a raid (that includes the final fight against the reason of a raid) then a necro.also, a mage has REAL goals to level up and reach the high end game.the epic pet and the fear-buff at 59 are great spells/items which increase the power of a mage alot while the necromancer class has no real valuable goals to reach level 60.the epic is pretty weak when compared with most of the other epics and the spells are not that good to reach level 60.<P>i personaly, would give the advice to play a shaman..thats the best (overall) class in the game.but since you asked for mage or necro, i will not do that.<P>--------------------<P>You can never &#8220;win&#8221; a debate with someone who truly believes they are incapable of being wrong (or at least of admitting they are wrong). - Sshadow

Totally unresistable, there is nothing in the game that will resist it, period.  It's not lure-based, it simply has no resistance whatsoever.<P>The previous versions (Malosi, Malosini, etc) are all resisted as much as their slows.  To see you say that the other spells in the Malo line have a very low resistance rate, I can only assume you've never grouped with a shaman.  I hope you at least realise how easily their slows are resisted...<P>--------------------<P>"...you've been given the reason which can distinguish between good and evil, and you've been also given free will; this may meet with difficulties at first, but it wins everything in the end, if it's fed with virtue..." – Dante Alighieri, <I>The Divine Comedy: Purgatorio</I>, XVI, 73-78

I've never had a problem getting in groups.  I've always been welcome on raids even those not in my own guild or groups for regular XP hunting. *shrug* I've heard all the comments about necro's being undesired but to be quite honest, this has never happened to me.  Chanters like I'm watching their back for that one mob that resists them, and clerics like to know that I have that extra bit of mana incase things go sour.  I use my dots, even though they will rarely go all the way they do damage per tick which is like an extra sword hand swinging and with the rate i get mana back i could care less about wasted mana.  Plus when that pull goes bad and people drop like flies I feign and am all set to do the CR.<P>I'm curious where all these other necro's play?  I've been given nothing but compliments and welcomes over my abilities.  I guess i'm doing something wrong.  <IMG SRC="wink.gif" border="0">

Demetri is talking about charming the foreman in OT, I believe.

I spent the majority of my mid 50's to high 50's leveling in HS and I used charm all the time.  If you do not know what your doing then yes it is dangerous but if you do it is probably the MOST POWERFUL tool we have.<P>Nothing like having a pet that hits harder then any tank in the group, has no hps then any tank in the group, does not require any healing and you will kill later in it's weakened state.<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><BR>i have never had thrall of bones last 4 min<BR><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>I would say my average charm duration is about 2 minutes but I have had several go 3 minutes and a few hit the 4 minute mark.  Oh and that is without MR debuffing [never had a Enchanter in our usual group].  I imagine with the proper MR debuffing it could hit the 8 minute max duration mark.<P>But usually I charm to turn an extra into a super powered pet and use it to slay the mobs we where facing.  Once the fight was over I would FD and we would kill the uncharmed mob.<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><BR>you dont have to take my word for it, just ask any high lvl enchanter. or a druid for that matter.<BR><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Enchanters do not charm all that often because they are not built for it and have far to much to do anyways.  Druids do not charm often because outside of Fear there is hardly any worthwhile Animal content in dungeons.<P>You can argue that you think charm is a bad tactic all you want and it will not change my EXPERIENCE with using it.  I used it very effectively and to my advantage.  Perhaps that is one of the reasons I never had problems finding groups.  I understood and used our spells to ENHANCE my role in groups instead of finding reasons why we suck.<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><BR>shaman is a better class then a necro, damage wise and support wise. <BR><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>I would agree that a Shaman has more to offer a group then a Necro but they are different classes.  They each provide different abilities to a group.<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><BR>how come none of you mention a shamy,s primary function? <BR><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Because none of us are n00bies.  <P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><BR>and the new velious group buff taps are a joke compared to what a shamy can already do.<BR><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>I agree with you there.

Think about it a minute dumb ass.  Picture a merchants reaction when a skeleton strolls into their shop?  They like a skeleton better then say a DE?!?  It made no sense.

Demetri Kaine <BR>Something that you should know about elemetal illusion they DO adjust your faction to monsters (alike undead illusion)<BR>In elemetal illusion you are none KoS in SolA and SolB, in tree form/wolf form (yes enchanters have illusion such kind too) you are not KoS to brownie (kinda neat if you want to buy distillate mana line of spells)
