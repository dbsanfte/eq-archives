This past week I have been in two situations that have ended in a bit of grief and arguments.<P>First, I am a 48 Cleric with 190 Wis and some + mana stuff on, not much.  This is my first PC in this game.  She is not a twink (always broke) and I enjoy playing the role of the Cleric.<P>Situation 1-In DL after getting to NWall, I ooc for a group.  I get a tell from a fellow Cleric to take his at SERuins.  Sure thing, no problem.  I take the group, we lose the chanter and get a Rogue.  So here we are, 48 Cleric, Warrior, Monk, Mage, Rogue, Shaman (or Druid, cant remember which) all in their upper 40's and low 50's.  No Chanter or Bard.  Someone says to move to the Webs.  Ive never been there but we go.<BR>  Heres the situation.  I know my mana pool.  I know in a fast pulling group without a mana battery, how many CHeals I have, etc.  Getting a group to wait to pull after giving out buffs till Im viable mana wise is like pulling teeth anyway.  Anyway, the pulling and aggros begin at the Web.   I give out a Celestial to the MT.  After a moment a Celestial to the MA.  Everyone is at full life after the mob is down and Im 90m.  (I can do Celestials with no mana battery all day no problem).<BR>  So the Warrior begins to lecture me on mana conservation, telling me to CHeal him at 1 bub(Ok, that would be 1 Cheal per pull, which would make me to 0om in 3 pulls with lesser heals to others.  And were out in the open getting aggroed).  I politely inform him that I know my mana pool, and if he doesnt like my style, then get another Cleric.  We kepp going.  <BR>  I get aggroed, hit the wrong key and get beat on a bit, Monk comes and gets it off me. Then the Warrior chews him out for not letting the Rogue take it.  Monk says sorry, hes not letting the Cleric die.  (I hit the wrong key and my "On me" macro didnt go off).  At least the Monk was watching my lifebar  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"><BR>  At this point I let the group know that they need to get to a safe spot and get another Cleric.  Everyone is healed, no aggro and I gate out, and let them know Im doing it.  At least 1 turned up in the Nexus dead within 5 mins and just ripped my ass for leaving.<BR>  My fault here?  Was I healing wrong without a mana battery as a backup? <P>2nd Situation.<BR>  Once again SERuins.  Groups been doing fine, 5 of us, no Chanter no Bard.  We get a Chanter to fill the last spot, I get to a point where mana is not a problem, give the Chanter my best buffs and best Symbols.  After a bit I let the puller know all is good.<BR>  Im in the midst of healing one Warrior when my Chanters lifebar does the Chanters lifebar thing and zips down to almost dead by the time I can target him and cast my fastest heal on him (being Resolution since it was up and memed and is a faster cast than Superior, but the 1 extra second wouldnt have made any difference anyway).  Of course, he does the chanter thing and dies before it gets off.  Now, nothing against Chanters, I like em.  What caster doesnt?  But they die, and they die FAST.<BR>  So I get the rest of the party healed up, cast my Rez on him and wait.  Man, this guys gets just PISSED.  First he chews me for getting him killed, then chews me for sending him a Rez w/o asking him first if he wants mine (75%).  I politely inform him that, 1. I didnt kill him or let him get killed, the spider he was trying to Mez killed him.  2nd, he can always refuse a Rez, so whats the big deal?<BR>  In a private tell and in group, I told him that I didnt mean for him to die and apologized.  He responded with "your not paying attention and you let me die, and you didnt ask permission before rezzing.  And by your Rez, you gave me a bug"  ????  I respond with, "bud, if you think I let party members die on purpose, then the hell with you.  Find yourself another group" and ejected him from the group.  The rest of the group sympathized with me, but he proceeded to attack me in /oocs which I gracefully ignored or answered with nice responses making him look stupid.  I then informed him in a tell afterwards that its "JUST A FRIGGIN GAME, GET OVER IT, **** HAPPENS".  Every group I have ever been in, I rez my people, unless theres a higher Cleric around and if they have time to do one.  Never had to ask permission before although this guy acted like I commited the ultimate sin by not asking first.<BR>  My bad?  Did I handle this situation wrong?<P>Now these situations are obviously my sides of the storys, the other sides might have something differrent to say, so bear this in mind.<P><BR>Now for an opinion.  I made 49 last night and need a place to level.  Im sick of DL and dont want to do Karanors, so any ideas out there?<P>Thanks for listening guys, and I respect any opinions from the veteran Clerics out there.  I read these forums all the time and get great info and ideas from most of you.  I cant wait to do my first Raid which wont be long now.<P>Thanks a million,<BR>Sara

I am a 54 lvl cleric on Tallon Zek.  I have had warriors tell me to wait until they are down to one bub or go beserker, then heal.  Depending on the situation I will go ahead and do that, I have gotten pretty good at timing the mob hits against the warriors hps.<BR>I believe that in your situation you did everything correctly.  As far as the chanter dying, it happens.  I wouold explain that you had to wait until the last heal spell went off, before you could cast, and it was a second to late.  If the chanter is not able to understand that, oh well, maybe time will teach him how hard you and other clerics work to keep them alive.<BR>I always make sure that I tell the person I am rezzing "are you rdy for rez" to make sure that I do not waste my mana when they may not be looking at the screen, can you say, not paying attention.  If not that I will ask if they want me to rez and are they rdy, if they do not give me a response within 10 seconds, I do a say in group chat so that all know I asked him.  If he or she does not answer then I wait until they tell me they want a rez.  If I know the person I may send them several tells, but in a pickup group, I will wait and now waste my time trying to get their attention.  I figure they will let me know when they are ready for the rez.<BR>As for all others telling me how to do my job, haah!  Most people who tell me better ways to do my job as a cleric usually have either a more casual tone about it, or send me private tells.  Others have requested that I do it a certain way, and I do, only so long as it does not cause anyone to die.<BR>I would tell em to take a flying leap at a rolling doughnut in order to, well I am sure you get the idea.<P>--------------------<P>54th cleric of TallonZek and Proud Guild Leader Of Archaic Arbitrators

Situation 1:  The warrior was correct in saying Complete Heal is more mana efficient.  You would actually be LESS likely to run out of mana using that spell than by using Celestial Heal.  However, you did say that you were in an open area, getting agro.  Plus you were casting heals on the other members of your group.  In that situation I would tend to use Celestial rather than Complete Heal too, due to its low agro and lower cast time, thus allowing you to react to changing situations on a more timely basis.  This is especially true when you have no real crowd control.<P>Situation 2:  Deaths are going to happen no matter how good you.  Any enchanter worth his salt should be used to dying by now.  Of course, by now, you should be used to being blamed for ANYTHING that goes wrong by now too.  Like Toldekk mentioned, I would have asked if he was ready for a res first, but other than that, no.  And yes, I have been asked by groupmates to find them a better res than what I could cast.  I simply tell them, if they want better, they can get it themselves, I have a group to maintain and don't have time to cater to their foibles.<P>One last bit of advice for you, Saralee.  Relax.  Don't let things get to you.  Expect others to treat you with respect but also remember to treat them with respect.  Remember the golden rule.<P>--------------------<P>Vidar Vonvidi<BR>Cleric in Training (52)<BR>Summoner of Brell's Blessed Brew<P>Titans of Luclin

More fun...<P>I get a tell from a fellow Cleric to take his at SERuins. <P>--Then again, nothing beats premade goodness. <P>Sure thing, no problem. <P>-- Easy going - I like that. <P><BR>I take the group, we lose the chanter and get a Rogue. <P>--Decent trade. <P><BR>So here we are, 48 Cleric, Warrior, Monk, Mage, Rogue, Shaman (or Druid, cant remember which) all in their upper 40's and low 50's. <P>--Sounds like fast kills to me .<P>No Chanter or Bard. <P>--Cool, no one to steal aggro from MT....<P>Someone says to move to the Webs. <P>--Tell 'em No. I got asked to Move to Karnor's at lev 42. I said Sure - you guys go , I'll stay here - Thanks! ...We didn't go. <P>Ive never been there but we go.<P>--Then again exploration is good. <P>Heres the situation. I know my mana pool. I know in a fast pulling group without a mana battery, how many CHeals I have, etc. Getting a group to wait to pull after giving out buffs till Im viable mana wise is like pulling teeth anyway.<P>--You're a rare breed.<P> Anyway, the pulling and aggros begin at the Web. I give out a Celestial to the MT. After a moment a Celestial to the MA. Everyone is at full life after the mob is down and Im 90m. (I can do Celestials with no mana battery all day no problem).<BR>So the Warrior begins to lecture me on mana conservation, telling me to CHeal him at 1 bub(Ok, that would be 1 Cheal per pull, which would make me to 0om in 3 pulls with lesser heals to others.<P>--Ask him (in group), excuse me, can you heal? <BR>Then STFU and let me heal.<P> And were out in the open getting aggroed). I politely inform him that I know my mana pool, and if he doesnt like my style, then get another Cleric.<P>-- I admire you!<P> We kepp going. <BR>I get aggroed, hit the wrong key and get beat on a bit, Monk comes and gets it off me. Then the Warrior chews him out for not letting the Rogue take it. Monk says sorry, hes not letting the Cleric die. (I hit the wrong key and my "On me" macro didnt go off). At least the Monk was watching my lifebar <P>--I've been there. And it churns my gut to knwo that ANYONE ELSE HAS BEEN THERE WITH A FARTNUGGET like that.      <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"><P>At this point I let the group know that they need to get to a safe spot and get another Cleric. <P>-- I would've done that same thing - or asked for a new main tank. <P><BR>Everyone is healed, no aggro and I gate out, and let them know Im doing it. At least 1 turned up in the Nexus dead within 5 mins and just ripped my ass for leaving.<P>--So what? You weren't in the group any more.<BR>So what if they die TWENTY MINUTES later? Is that your fault? Um... hell no.<P>My fault here? Was I healing wrong without a mana battery as a backup? <P>--I agree with you totally.<P>2nd Situation.<BR>Once again SERuins. Groups been doing fine, 5 of us, no Chanter no Bard. We get a Chanter to fill the last spot, I get to a point where mana is not a problem, give the Chanter my best buffs and best Symbols. <P>-- My first line is  - Need to buff chanter and Main tank  - (in that order )  - then I say when to go. <BR>If they go before you say, they don't get healed and they die.<P><BR>After a bit I let the puller know all is good.<BR>Im in the midst of healing one Warrior when my Chanters lifebar does the Chanters lifebar thing and zips down to almost dead by the time I can target him and cast my fastest heal on him (being Resolution since it was up and memed and is a faster cast than Superior, but the 1 extra second wouldnt have made any difference anyway).<P>--Always try to have your chanter targetted  when they are doing crowd control if possible. And /duck. <BR>I don't know how many hp your warrior had.<BR>Perhaps he could've held up while you focused on chanter.<P><BR> Of course, he does the chanter thing and dies before it gets off.<P>-Me - Lev 51 chanter - 900 Hp with no buffs      <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0">. <P>Now, nothing against Chanters, I like em. What caster doesnt? But they die, and they die FAST.<P>--See 900 Hp above.<BR> <BR>So I get the rest of the party healed up, cast my Rez on him and wait. <P>--Always ask if they are ready<P>Man, this guys gets just PISSED. First he chews me for getting him killed, then chews me for sending him a Rez w/o asking him first if he wants mine (75%). <P>--But really, - So what? he just has to wait 'til the timter box goes away. <P>I politely inform him that, 1. I didnt kill him or let him get killed, the spider he was trying to Mez killed him. <P>- Actually, he can't heal himself. If there wasn't another healer in thegroup, he died - because - you didn't heal him....<P><BR>2nd, he can always refuse a Rez, so whats the big deal?<P>--If I remember right, once you REFUSE  a rez, you can't be rezzed again. It used to be that you had to log out to clear that stupid box. Now they've put a timer on it. <P><BR>In a private tell and in group, I told him that I didnt mean for him to die and apologized. He responded with "your not paying attention and you let me die, and you didnt ask permission before rezzing. And by your Rez, you gave me a bug" ???? I respond with, "bud, if you think I let party members die on purpose, then the hell with you. Find yourself another group" and ejected him from the group. The rest of the group sympathized with me, but he proceeded to attack me in /oocs which I gracefully ignored or answered with nice responses making him look stupid. <P>--Yeahp, you let him die. No doubt about that. Sometimes chanters do stupid things and cause a LOT more aggro than they need too. Sometimes they don't. <BR>You did say "spider" not "He was chain stunning 4 spiders and they ate his ass like brown gravy N Tators."  <P>I then informed him in a tell afterwards that its "JUST A FRIGGIN GAME, GET OVER IT, **** HAPPENS".<P><BR>--And showed your superior maturity by swearing at him. Cool. Welcome to his level. <P> Every group I have ever been in, I rez my people, unless theres a higher Cleric around and if they have time to do one. Never had to ask permission before although this guy acted like I commited the ultimate sin by not asking first.<P>- Sounds like he was mad abocast my fastest  can target him m andied ? My chanter dies almost every other day.      <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"><P>My bad? Did I handle this situation wrong?<BR>-- Um sokmewhat, in my opion . Probably not in yours.. Ah well it's just a game. <P><BR>Now these situations are obviously my sides of the storys, the other sides might have something differrent to say, so bear this in mind.<P><BR>Now for an opinion. I made 49 last night and need a place to level. Im sick of DL and dont want to do Karanors, so any ideas out there?  <P>-- Grab a tank and a slower and go to burning woods. No one is there. Mobs A PLENTY. Hell grab a 6 man group and take the entrance to Sarnak central. <BR> <A HREF="http://forums.crgaming.com/cgi-bin/eq/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic&f=18&t=000200" TARGET=_blank>http://forums.crgaming.com/cgi-bin/eq/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic&f=18&t=000200</A>

Forst off..<BR>WARNING: DO NOT GO TO KARNORS<BR>If you think healing in DL is bad and people yelling at you on how to conserve your mana, then KC will be hell for you.  I suggest doing what I did...  Find a good monk and go to Lower Guk.  You have all the buffs you need for undead froggies and you and a monk would make a great team.  I lvl'd from 49 to 51 in 24 hours there, fast steady exp.  and safe too.  FG is good for loot and safe cause only 1 wanderer goes in the hall.  If you get attacked while the monk is pulling, easy to root one and let him know.  <P>And for anyone that gets yappy and tells me how I should use my heals to heal them I just say "*Forgets to heal %t*  opps sorry"<BR>If that doesn't shut them up, I can always find a group who will be happy to have me and respect that I know what I'm doing with my toon.<BR>Clerics are definately the coolest classes in the game.  And with your Remedy spell you will never have a chanter die again, unless they are hit with ice comet and you are oom.  The 3 sec cast time is very nice    <IMG SRC="wink.gif" border="0"> <P>Safe travels to you all<BR>Callyanna Amerot<BR>53rd lvl Cleric<BR>The Rathe

Hmm....<P><I>"So the Warrior begins to lecture me on mana conservation, telling me to CHeal him at 1 bub(Ok, that would be 1 Cheal per pull, which would make me to 0om in 3 pulls with lesser heals to others. And were out in the open getting aggroed). I politely inform him that I know my mana pool, and if he doesnt like my style, then get another Cleric. We keep going. "</I><P>Well...the warrior does have a point.  The majority of tanks around 50 (pre cleric LVL 59) its more efficient to complete heal as opposed to celestial.  Important things: ASK how much HP he has with all buffs on (At your level would likely be 2500? shrug, guessing ;p).  Rule of thumb: (Assuming cheal is completing at one bub) If tank has 1800+ hp buffed, then its worth chealing them (not considering agro, pre 59).  The more HP above 1800 he has buffed, the more you should consider using cheal.  <P>It's ratio time!~ Assuming 2500hp tank.<BR>Cheal: 400 mana - Heals 2k (completes at 1 bub) Ratio: 5 hp : 1 mana.<P>Celestial: 225 mana - Heals 750ish Ratio: 3.33 hp : 1.<P>Not figuring in agro issues / etc, it would be more efficient to cheal him.<P><I>"At this point I let the group know that they need to get to a safe spot and get another Cleric. Everyone is healed, no aggro and I gate out, and let them know Im doing it. At least 1 turned up in the Nexus dead within 5 mins and just ripped my ass for leaving."</I><P>It's not your fault if they do something stupid after you leave.  You have the right to leave, any time when members can reach safety, and have no agro.<P><BR><I>"Man, this guys gets just PISSED.

I didnt kill him or let him get killed, the spider he was trying to Mez killed him. 2nd, he can always refuse a Rez, so whats the big deal?"</I><P>Well...there is a bug in game, as in if you refuse / close a rez box (through changing windows, zoning, etc) then they have to camp out and back in to receive a rez.  <P>And you are correct, enchanters die a lot.  Sometimes, there ain't **** you can do.<P><I>"Now for an opinion. I made 49 last night and need a place to level. Im sick of DL and dont want to do Karanors, so any ideas out there?"</I><P>Hmmm...if you have a solid partner i'd reccomend the hole.  Entrance exp there is insane.  If you don't, I'd reccomend Velketor's Labrynth.  This much maligned zone isn't THAT bad, and if you took the Kunark Express leveling (LoIO, OT, DL) you can get a handle on dungeons.  Take any Chardok (even thou I don't care for it so much any more), OS, and HS groups you can get.  Make some if you gotta.  And yes, the last two require keys, if you don't have them, go get them.<P>Pit/Village can help you get a grip on some hard mobs.  Tpos in Village is ...interesting to heal for, assuming your tank is something besides a war, or is not using defensive.  Overall, you can get some decent pickup groups.<P>Ohh, and person above, the rez box does take exactly one hour to go away.  It isn't fast ;p.<P>--------------------<P>Taishar Gigoloforhire<BR>d0rf high priest of the pants<BR>Immortals Rising - Torvonnilous

Thought that they had changed the rez box in an earlier patch so that it wouldn't get bugged like it used to.  And yes, the rez box does last exactly one hour, I tested it out myself.  <P>An exp'ing cleric's concern is not just mana management but also aggro management and keeping everyone alive.  I follow the rule that unless the group is about to go up against a huge mob, then I should not be full mana.  Buffs will always need refreshing, someone will always need a heal, heck, can stun or nuke too, just don't let that mana go to waste.  Casting ch on a tank is usually, but not always necessarily the best, and it is up to the cleric's judgement when is the best time.  If the mob is about dead and say the warrior is about to pull and you have full mana, might as well put them at full health with a celestial in case they make a bad pull.  I'd say you did fine.  Was a new group and its fine to focus on learning what damage each member can take, especially if its a new area.  <BR>Its best to try to keep all your group members but the main tank near full at all times so you aren't stuck in the position where 2 people need a heal NOW and you can only heal one.  <BR>Generally, though, focus on learning when the best time to ch the tank against the types of mobs you're fighting, but as long as you can keep up your mana and your group, whatever way you heal should be acceptable to the group.  <P>Before you get your rez stick, should always ask if the person is ready for a rez.  Its your mana at stake =o<P>You made sure your group was fine before you left--anything that happened afterwards was not your problem, though as a general rule try to give them some warning so that they can try to find a replacement.  <P>Get used to people putting the blame on you for things that aren't your fault. One of the worst aspects of the cleric class is that we are always the first scapegoat.  <BR>For quick targetting, use the F1 (self) and F2 and on keys for the rest of the group.  If there is a pull of more than one, always keep an eye on the enchanter; if you have extra time throw a root on any trouble mobs to help out the enchanter.  If they get hit, as soon as you can, start a heal on them.  They should never really be below 4 1/2 bubs of health if you can help it.  <P>If a mob is on you, root is your friend.  Find a nearby wall if possible, put your back against it and root.  Although it sounds bad, you really can't always depend on your group to get mobs off of you, can really only depend on yourself. If you forsee major trouble then call for help, but resort to root first if possible.  Keep DA and DB up as back up "get out of aggro" free cards during trouble.  Perma-mem DA DB and root, always.  Heck, I was even able to root a Vex Thal mob lol.<P>Yup I did the EJ route until about 51.  If you can, go here.  Pull to and fight at the TT zoneline.  Pretty easy to get single pulls 90 percent of the time.  Can easily duo cleric warrior--I did, and we both had crappy equipment at the time hehe.  <P>Good luck, some pickup groups are really not fun with the "fun" type of people you can have in your group.  Try not to let it frustrate you, though its much easier said than done.<P>--------------------<P>~<A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=24725" TARGET=_blank>Aiyre Soulfyre</A><BR>High Priest<BR>~<A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=149712" TARGET=_blank>Xaria Soulchanger</A><BR>55 Enchanter

i dont know much about situation 1, but it sounds good to me.<P>situation 2 was definatly not your fault. if you have a cleric in your group, they're their to do their best to keep you alive and get you back fast when you're not...which is what you did.<BR>if i'm in a group with a rez i dont like, i try to tell them before hand that i'd like to wait for another...and if i'm not next to the zone i died in, i take it anyway.<P>besides that, dying to a big train is always a rush as long as you have a few seconds to see the mobs come pouring in =p<P>--------------------<P>Sanalin<BR>60 Enchanter, Prexus<BR>Twisted Fates<BR>and<BR>Sanalinette<BR>33 cleric (she's getting there...)

Ok, I guess I'll throw in my 2cp here.<P>First of all:<BR> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>In DL after getting to NWall<HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>From this point on, expect things to go FUBAR and to put up with one annoying idiot after another.  You're in DL, and the best advice I could give you is to GET OUT of DL.<P><BR>On the first scenario:<BR>Yes, using CH on the main tank is more efficient than using Celestial IF you're only fighting one mob at a time an the MA can hold aggro so the mob doesn't ping-pong around the tanks.  If a mob is jumping around and inflicting damage to multiple tanks, then using CH becomes a waste of time and Celestial is more efficient.  If the MA doesn't like how you're healing, tell him to learn what the "taunt" key does and hold the damn aggro...otherwise tell him to STFU or heal himself. (Like I said, you're in DL and dealing with moron central, so the only way these folks will get the point is if you go down to their level)  Don't worry, if your MA is having a hard time understanding how a cleric works, you won't have to deal with him ever again because he'll never leave DL.  And about the monk saving your butt...he did the correct thing and should have been praised for it.  The MA has one job...hold aggro.  It's the responsibility of the other tanks to watch for stuff like that and take care of it.<P>On the second scenario:<BR>That enchanter is exactly like the MA from your first story...an idiot and will never leave DL.  If he gets so upset about a death in an exp group, then his head will explode if he ever tries to go on a planes raid, or any raid for that matter, because deaths happen and are a natural part of the experience.  You did the best you could with the tools you had...full buffs for the chanter and trying to heal as fast as possible.  When you get Remedy, your life will be much easier when it comes to saving the lives of casters.  In addition, it may be a good idea to make a hotkey to target and heal the enchanter:<P>/target Enchanter<BR>/cast # (which will be your fastest healing spell)<BR>/assist (which will target the mob beating on the enchanter)<P>With that, you've thrown a heal at the enchanter and targetted the mob for a root.  Might help with grumpy chanters who think they should be the only ones to be healed.<P>--------------------<P>Velisaris Groovenhymer<BR>55 Erudite Templar of Quellious<BR>Povar server<BR>"Man, why can't they bring back or remake GOOD shows, like 'BJ & the Bear.'

In the first situation, I really think you did everything right. I never start out with complete heal with a totally new tank and especially not in a new situation. I always want to get a feel for their hp and how well they take damage and how well they keep agro before I start with the complete heal if I can. And I usually ask how much hp they have after I buff them as well, that helps. <P>I really hate it when tanks try to tell me how to heal, and I'll usually let them know pretty clearly that yeah, I'm kinda bent and mostly confused but I do know how to heal thank you very much. If they want to argue with me about it then I do leave. Most of them stfu. <P>But, you were in DL, land of the concrete minds and inflated egos, so I guess that you have to expect trouble. Best advice: get the heck out of DL and don't go to KC and don't go to Velks. <P>Anyway, in the second scenario I probably would have ducked out of that heal and healed the chanter. Hopefully, there would have been enough time. Or if I saw that there were lots of adds I would have thrown a cele on the tank or a quicker heal and then kept an eye on the chanter until they got things under control. Maybe a cele on the chanter, I dunno. Its hard to second guess if you're not there. But my order of heals is: chanter, tank, any secondary tanks like rangers rogues, other casters, myself  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"> The other day I had practicly the whole raid screaming at me to heal myself but I was saving it for the tank  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"> We got through it somehow but it was pretty messy. <P>Anyway, I digress. Yeah, you should probably ask before you rez, you'd be surprised at how pissy people get about even the difference between a 90 and a 96 rez. I never volunteer my rezzes on raids anymore. If they want one bad enough they'll ask, usually they're waiting for the higher clerics to get them. <P>And.. oh yeah.. keep track of those names so you don't have to take crap from a knowitall tank and a pissy chanter again.

Situation 1: <BR>In the long run CH is usually more mana efficient due to the hp pool of your average low 50's tank.<BR>BUT you can have no idea if you have never grouped with that person before.  For all you know he has the ac and hp of a wet tissue.<BR>I just love it when melee tell you how and when to heal, especially the 'hey I'm a big tank heal me at one bub' ones.  I can honesly say that I never start a CH on one bub, there's too many things that could happen like sudden adds, poisoning, spells casts by mobs, etc, etc.<BR>As has been pointed out on many occasions on cleric boards, we don't stand there and tell tank how to hit stuff.<P>Situation 2: <P>Enchanters are made out of tissue paper. They die. A lot. If people don't like to die, they shouldn't make a chanter.<BR>There's really not a lot that can save a chanter at mid levels once he/she gets smacked about.<BR>Praying that the MA taunts off, the mez sticks or that a fast heal lands are the only things really. Oh and for the chanter to get rid of that mountain of int and cha gear and get some hp/ac gear instead.<BR>As for him dissing you publicly - there are some very sad people out there. Just /ignore, they'll soon want a rez and it will be such a shame when you can't hear them begging.<P>As for the rez, I never, ever have complained what % rez I got when it wasn't my own (This includes any melee characters I've played). I will not rez people who ask me what % rez it is, cause its rude as hell. I mean you didn't tell the chanter to run off and get you C2 or KEI cause he couldn't cast it did you?<P>--------------------<P>Crowgoth Nephilim<BR>Blonde as Hell High Priest<BR>United Kingdoms of Bristlebane

On Situation 1: If you were using Celestial Healing and were at 90m, I fail to see why the tank was griping about mana conservation.  What part of the picture am I missing?<P>I&#8217;ve found that normally Complete Heal is most efficient to use, but ignoring the numbers, there are so many things that factor into that efficiency: Is the tank the only one taking the damage?  If I duck mid-cast to start an emergency heal on someone else, will the tank be able to survive, particularly if there are adds? Will the puller stay in range for a Complete Heal, or is he running off at half health and pulling more before the spell lands? If I have to Complete Heal early and end up with aggro, can someone get the stuff off me before I am interrupted?  Do I have a corner to wedge myself in so I can commit to a Complete Heal without interruptions if there are adds? Will I have time and the mana to lock myself into a Complete Heal if I also have to stun-root adds?  If the answer is &#8220;no&#8221; to more than one of those questions, I might reconsider using Complete Heal as my primary spell...<P>Waiting until the tank is at one bubble of health can be very, very risky without a crowd controller.  I wasn&#8217;t really comfortable playing the berserker game until a warrior in Dreadlands suggested it - and I made damn sure he knew that I was not infallible and he could die. ;P I still let warriors I am unfamiliar with know that, if they want to play that game.<P>Sometimes it is helpful to ask the tank how he or she wants to be healed as soon as you join the group, and work from there.  If they know you&#8217;re not comfortable playing the berserker game, well, they&#8217;re forewarned.<P>I do not think you were healing wrong if you were keeping the group healthy and were at 90m. <P>On Situation 2: Of course I&#8217;m prejudiced, but I think your enchanter was a bit of an ass.  Enchanters will die - but so will every other class!  Clerics are not infallible, and not everyone has the best reflexes all of the time.   Obviously, the same applies to enchanters.<P>I probably would have tried to interrupt my heal on the warrior (particularly if there was another tank or pseudotank) and throw a heal on the enchanter, or stun/root whatever was whacking the enchanter to give him a chance to move away, but I then again, I might not have had the presence of mind to do that. Hell, maybe I would hesitate with indecision, and both the warrior and the enchanter would die.  <IMG SRC="tongue.gif" border="0"><P>Enchanters are probably at least as high strung as clerics, but accusing you of LETTING him die - as if you&#8217;d done it on purpose, duh! - was uncalled for.  *****ing about a death doesn&#8217;t do any good unless suggestions are made to avoiding it next time.<P>I always ask if someone is ready for a rez before casting it (a habit formed from wasting mana by casting it on AFK people, zoning people, people screwing around with merchants or whatever else caused the box to disappear), but in most groups, the exp-starved deceased either asked the group to line up a higher rez or said they had someone else on the way.  Still - why did the enchanter group with you if he thought your rez was too low?  I&#8217;d think he should be grouping with a higher level cleric if he wants a higher level rez. Should we swear at all enchanters for not having and casting KEI on us? I think not.  I'm happy with whatever my group can provide.<P>Lower Guk and Sol B are still viable for exp at 50th.  Velketors would probably work, too, if it&#8217;s not too crowded.<P>--------------------<P>Vinta Bayle - Terris Thule<BR>56th Dark Elf Cleric

Ok, Thanks for all the input.<P>In some cases I can see where a little bit of clarification is required.<P>Sit 1.  The MT (Also puller) Had somewhere in the range of about 2500hps (+ or -), with my buffs.  He was pulling from the webs somewhere near FV zone I think, Im not sure as I was lost.  He couldnt help but pull more than 1, and there were adds and aggroes on those of us out in the open (Personally, Im not too keen on medding in an area where theres wandering mobs, instant aggro).  If I had cast CHeal, with no Mana battery, then theres no doubt in my mind that I would have ran out of mana very fast, and then the argument would have been more than it was.  There was no effective crowd control.  Nothing IMO can quite control adds & aggros like a Chanter or Bard.<P>I have no problem getting pointers from people.  None whatsoever.  But when I know what Im doing is the best that can be done in that situation, then Im going to stick with it.  And the tactic I used then, I got from these forums right here.<P>Sit 2. Ive just written the guy off as a jerk, that must have been having a bad day.  After reading Sassii's play by play of it, I felt kinda bad (But not too bad) about letting myself go down to his level, although the tells I was getting from him at the time doesnt deserve repeating.  I do admit to hesitating when his lifebar went down, but I dont think anything I could have done would have saved him, only have prolonged the inevitable.  It would have been either him or the Warrior, and I chose the Warrior.  Course, I didnt tell the Chanter that.<P>I was not aware of any bug with rezzing, so I have now taken that into account.  Im asking before every Rez first, which some dont understand, but asking all the same.<P>I learn more from the msg boards than from anything anyone has told me in the game.  I can and do use CHeal when the groups Im in are better balanced than the first one.  Having a Bard or Chanter makes a huge difference.  Thats just my opinion on that one.  But, later this past week, I did try it in a fairly good group on the MT (Who was also puller) in DS.  Once again, no chanter, no bard.  Lets just say that it was a good thing a zone was nearby.  The MT was a buddy that was (keyword is WAS) a firm believer in CHeal, always.  But, he is usually in a very well balanced group with a Chanter AND a Bard.  He was a bit surprised at the difference.  After we all recovered, he let me heal my way, and we did fine for over 2 hrs w/o stopping.<P>I use CHeal always with Bards and Chanters in a very fast pulling group and in that situation, you guys are absolutely correct.  It is the best way.  The only way.<P>So, in conclusion, Im grateful for all of your inputs.  Im outta DL (THANK GOD) and am currently hunting the forager and hunter for my Sebilis key.  Im am happy to say that I am not bored to tears doing the same old thing  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"><P>You guys have a great 4th, and Cyas around in the game  <IMG SRC="cool.gif" border="0"> <BR>Sara

If your average complete heal does 1400 or more, then using celestial heal <B>will</B> cost you more mana overall, there's no way around this fact (unless <A HREF="http://lucy.fnord.net/" TARGET=_blank>Lucy</A> has some bad info). For that 2500 hp tank, even if you healed early and CH landed at 2 bubbles, that's still a 1500 point heal.<P>So you see why, with the information I have, your assessment that you would have ran out of mana using CH, but not with celestial, simply doesn't add up... so there's probably more to the picture that isn't evident yet.<P>And I think the reason lies in your statement that using CH would mean one CH per fight.<P>Judging from your original post, your tank simply isn't taking that much damage per pull. One celestial heal was enough to heal him up to full, meaning he lost around 750 hp (a bubble and a half).<P>Unless you had an enormous amount of trouble with adds, a 2500 tank losing 750 hp per pull doesn't require him to be healed every pull. If you could resist the urge to keep your tank topped off when unnecessary, you could let him dip low enough for CH to become more efficient than Celestial Healing.<P><BR>I advise trying to CH when you can do it efficiently, even if you are able to keep FM all day using celestial heal. Practice is always good.   <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"> There's always room for improvement, no matter how good you are. Besides, you can do <I>something</I> with the saved mana if you're in the mood to do it. I personally advise nuking as long as everyone who needs / wants a buff has a relatively fresh one and you only nuke if you're high on mana (say, over 80%), but there are other possibilities too.<P>Arlina

One reason for *not* letting the tank run out half dead is that when he comes back *almost* dead, you have no time for a less agro producing spell like celestial heal, and are forced to use a high agro spell. So, if there are adds, you have a bunch of new best friends beating the crap out of you. I'd rather the tank went out full or nearly full, just so I don't have to deal with the adds when I have to heal him the minute he comes back. Just my preference.

I have found that there are 2 types of "Mana efficient". One of course being the raw numbers. However, raw numbers rarely ever work out in the real world (well not really real world... ok well you know what I mean   <IMG SRC="tongue.gif" border="0"> ). Yes CH is more mana efficient, but that really is only true when there is only 1 person getting hit and there is only one mob being attacked (i.e. usually during a raid). During most (not all but most) xp grinds it is common to get adds, and here was one of them. So this is where the other version of "mana efficient" comes from... is it mana efficient to have the tank die and everyone have to zone or die? You could zone with FM and still that wouldn't be mana efficient. Staying at 90m and keeping everyone full health is much more "mana efficient" then running the risk of the tank dying because you got an add before CH could finish casting.<P>Maybe I'm wrong, but it's just my 2cp. Oh my favorite is when the Warrior says "Trust me man... I also have a level 55 Cleric... I know what's more mana efficient."<P>EDIT: Oh yeah... this is all pre level 50 here. Try Celestial in Seb and watch the health drop to zero before the first tick.

There are many ways to do things through utilizing spells, pathing, or aggro, depending on your style and whether you want more safety, more aggro, more mana efficiency, or more health-toppers.  <P>Fast pulling groups require different tactics depending on the types of mobs you are fighting as well as the type of group you have, and how well your group members play their class.

Ok, if people are going to tell me to only use Complete Heal, then I *only* want a chanter to use ONE mez spell.  I only want a druid to use ONE nuke.  Only want a warrior to use ONE weapon.<P>We have more heals in our spellbooks because... *gasp* Complete Heal isn't appropriate at all times.  <P>How's this for unconvential?  In DL, pulling lots and lots of spiders, killing fast, but no chanter.  Damage shields on the spiders were being icky (and dispelling damage shields isn't worth the mana).  Me and 4 tanks (2 warriors, a pally and an SK).  So all tanks were taking damage.  So what did I do?  Used Word of Healing every 3rd fight, just as spider was dying.  Healed up everyone to full, and I medded the mana back by the time for next cast.  <P>IMO, Complete Heal is NOT my only choice, it's not even my MAIN choice for standard exp groups.  And ya know what?  I've only had one death recently (in the last three levels) that was MY fault.  Well, sorta... he was out of range, neither of us could get back in range before he died.  He took equal blame on that one.  <P>So, Sara, I think you are doing fine.  Every cleric is different and has different playing styles.  Everyone knows best what they can do.  I think over all, you did fine with the situations you were presented.  <P>The only thing that I can say is that don't count on having someone as a manabattery.  And don't limit those classes as manabatteries only.  Having the extra mana regen is just that... extra.  I'd worry more about crowd control.  I'm having to educate a whole new set of guildie tanks to NOT come save me at the first sign of me getting beat on.  *sigh*  But that's another topic altogether.<P>--------------------<P><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=146209" TARGET=_blank>Kerowen Soulmender</A><BR><A HREF="http://www.soulbonded.com" TARGET=_blank>Soulbonded</A><BR>Drinal
