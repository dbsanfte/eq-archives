				<td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">Wow, so many misconceptions and misunderstandings about the Warrior job, I had to register!  My main job is a level 50 Paladin, but I recently got done leveling my subjob (Warrior) up to 37 so that I can concentrate on getting to 75 with Paladin.  Saying that Warrior is only a "Shield" aka tank is uninformed at best.
<br />

<br />
Warrior is a versatile and very powerful job, IMO one of the strongest in the game.  But trying to classify it as either a "Sword" or "Shield" is misguided, because what makes Warrior so powerful is that it can act as either ... and do it well.  The problem with people's perception of Warrior is that most people use Warrior as a stepping stone to get to their "Advanced" jobs, and so never try to bring out the potential of the class.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Tanking</span>
<br />
The "Shield."  Everyone seems big on Warriors tanking, but seems to think that they can't hold hate; however, it is very easy to hold hate in a party from 10-37 as a War/Mnk (War/Thf or War/Nin takes some juggling to hold hate at this level).  How easily could you hold hate if you could Provoke twice as often?  Well, Boost (Mnk 5) acts as a mini-Provoke (maybe 1/3 of a Provoke) and can be used twice as often as Provoke.  Dodge (Mnk 15) acts as an emergency hate-grabber, as does Warcry (War 35).  Also, Counter's always nice when tanking, though it's very inconsistent.  The biggest problem is that you may generate so much hate (Provoke + Boost + Damage) that the other players can't get the mob off of you if you get in trouble.
<br />

<br />
A well-equipped War/Mnk won't take much more damage than a Paladin (maybe slightly less than a Pld if you use Defender, which isn't always recommended), but you'll require slightly more healing because you can't self-heal.  Also, depending on your party setup, it may be beneficial for you to use Great Axe to tank (yes, eat a little extra damage), just so you can throw Shield Break at the beginning of a fight.  I would mainly do this if one skillchaining DD was lagging behind in TP consistently.  That and make the Rdm cast Gravity and the Blm cast Frost if melees are consistently missing the mob.
<br />

<br />
Now, on to ...
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Damage Dealing</span>
<br />
The infamous "Sword."  Regardless of what you think or have been told, Warriors can deal heavy damage.  Most, however, never equip their character to properly act as a competitor to other DD classes.  I never fail to laugh when I see a War/Rdm equipped with a Great Sword or Scythe complain that he can't deal damage.  Actually, sometimes I cry, but that's another matter.  To those who think a Warrior can't deal damage, though, I have two words to say, "Great Axe."
<br />

<br />
Great Axe has one of the highest Damage/Delay ratios in the game, and it's Warrior's A+ weapon.  Warrior gets Berserk at level 15.  From 15-25, this combined with attack oriented gear, Great Axe, and food is enough to put them in the top tier of melee damagers (at 23, Warrior gets Sturmwind, a VERY nice weaponskill).  At level 25, Warriors get Double Attack, which ups their damage even further.  At level 30, other classes catch up with a lot of job abilities, including from subjobs.  This is when you need to start using War/Thf when you're not tanking.
<br />

<br />
With a good Great Axe at level 30, you will be hitting for 70-90 damage per hit while Berserked (as a Hume); criticals are typically around 120 damage.  Sneak Attack + Sturmwind, at level 30+, is simply godly.  250 damage, <span style="font-style: italic">easily</span>.  270-300 is fairly common.  I've had mine max out at 380 when Double Attack fired during the weaponskill (~lvl 34).  Actually, 480, but that was with Mighty Strikes active, so it doesn't count.  This is NOT counting added damage from a skillchain.  You have to play carefully, because MOST tanks (including some Paladins) cannot hold hate over the type of damage you can do if you're stupid about it.
<br />

<br />
I parsed a series of battles recently playing as a War/Thf (from levels 35-37 in one party).  I consistently did around 25-40% (average, 32%) of the group's damage per fight, while playing with a rank 6 Sam/War and Tarutaru Blm/Whm.  Now the Tarutaru Blm COULD have outdamaged me hands down if he put his mind to it, but probably not without consistently drawing aggro.  I was ALREADY drawing aggro depending mainly on just how accurate I was in any given fight (high accuracy fight = aggro by the end, but ~40% damage).
<br />

<br />
Eventually, the Sam/War had to leave.  We replaced him with a Drk/War.  What happened to damage?  Well, the Drk/War consistently did around 20% (average player, our Sam was amazing).  I did around 27-40%, and our Blm/Whm made up the difference and took hate a few times.
<br />

<br />
Now the point of this post is not to get into some sort of contest with other jobs ("No, I can deal more damage than Warrior any day of the week! Rawr!"), but rather to provide some in game experience to show that Warrior CAN act as an effective "Sword", from level 10-50 at least.  I say 50, because one of the last parties I was in as a Pld/War was with a 50 War/Thf, which is where I got the (bright) idea that I should try it out for when I wasn't tanking while leveling my subjob.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Why haven't I ever seen what you're talking about?</span>
<br />
1.) <span style="font-style: italic">Weapon selection:</span>  As a Warrior, you need to have multiple weapons skilled up.  Preferably Axe (tanking) and Great Axe (DD and occasionally for tanking).  Scythe weaponskills are poor until Guillotine (which you never get as a Warrior), compared to Great Axe.  Great Sword weaponskills are better, but still don't compare.  Sword doesn't do as much damage as Axe when tanking (having tanked extensively with both), and the only time I used it as Warrior was to start Fusion with a Mnk or Thf/Mnk partner (Red Lotus Blade &gt;&gt; Combo).
<br />
2.) <span style="font-style: italic">Gear:</span>  You need TWO sets of gear.  Yes, that's right, two if you want to do it right.  One set is mainly +Def/Vit/Agi gear for tanking with just enough +Acc/Dex to hit the mob.  The other is +Attack/Accuracy/Str/Dex gear for DD.  If you want to come close to a Drk in damage, you need to equip yourself like a Drk does (ever seen a Drk with +Vit rings?).  If you try to mix and match (some +Def, some +Atk) you will be a mediocre tank and a mediocre damage dealer.  Sorry.
<br />
3.) <span style="font-style: italic">Players:</span>  Warrior is a standard job, and as such, it's one of the first jobs many people take to 18, and then 30.  This means the majority of Warriors you see from 1-30 are new players who are still learning the game, and generally are cash strapped (see #2).  Also, many people view Warrior as only a stepping stone to some other, better, job (Drk, Pld, Sam, Rng, Nin, etc.).  Luckily, I leveled Whm to 30 first, so by the time I came back to Warrior, I wanted to see if it could truly kick ass and take names.  It does.
<br />
4.) <span style="font-style: italic">Subjobs:</span>  From personal experience, War/Mnk is a good tank, but mediocre DD.  War/Nin is an excellent half-tank, half-DD.  War/Thf is a good damage dealer, but mediocre tank.  If you want to have versatility, you need to have multiple subjobs leveled all the way up, so you can switch from tank to DD and back depending on what your party wants.
<br />

<br />
Anyway, in regards to the "Sword/Shield" ("Great Axe/Shield?") question, my answer is "Either, depending on the situation."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<br />

<br />
If all characters are doing their jobs, at Lv. 30, where would you rate the characters damage per minute, in comparison to other classes.  He's outdamaged by BLMs, DRKs, SMNs, RNGs, THFs, RDMs, SAMs, NINs, BSTs, and over time, MNKs.  There aren't too many people that can't out-damage a WAR.  If you're thinking of starting the game, and you want to be the character that really takes the health down on a monster, then WAR I think would not be for you.  Yes, you'll hit the monster in addition to provoking, but more or less everyone expcept the WHM will hit harder than you will.  If you like the melee aspect, and you want to be a sword, and not a shield, consider DRK, or even SAM.  If you don't mind magic, try being a BLM, you'd be suprised the massive amounts of damage you'll do once you learn elemental weaknesses by heart, and how to MB off of skillchains.  RNG is really fun too...  There's a whole plethora of "swords" out there, and very few shields...  WAR, just happens to be, in my opinion, a shield, and a good one.  Only thing that tops it, is a Blink-tank, and a PLD.  I find, at around 30 I'll see WARs, using a 1-handed weapon, hitting the mob for 10-20 damage usually...  THFs will SA, and TA, for maybe 400 dmg within the first 30 secs...  The BLMs doing 60-100 per nuke, and RNGs hitting 75+ consistently...  Yes, you're damaging it, but you're not the one taking the noticeable chunks out of its health...  Esp. crab enemies and the like that have the dreaded Metallic Body, etc.  And yes, equipment does make the man...  But, like it was stated earlier, most WARs are new, and strapped for cash.  Equipment makes up a good bit of what kind of WAR you are, but if you're the tank, don't berserk.  Simply because, you're the "shield" not the "sword."  I've kicked many WARs from my parties simply because they insisted on using Berserk, and it made it a hell of a lot harder to keep his health up for me, being that his DEF was reduced.  When there is more than one tank, and you're not the main one, then Berserk is alright, making you slightly more of a "sword."  Just remember, that if you're the only WAR, chances are that you're a tank, and you're going to take the hits, and you're not going to deal all that much damage...  That's the reason you have voke, cuz the monsters get pissed at the little BLM that's nailing it for 5X as much as you are.  But yea, that's just my opinion on the matter.
<br />

<br />
Pretty much, you're the Marine, on the front-line...  And the BLMs are the Air Force, ready to napalm them once they're focused you!   <img src="images/smiles/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif" border="0" /></span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

Past 37, you don't see many warriors, due to these misconceptions.  I well equipped warrior can do damage on par to other jobs.  War/Nin isn't such a great tank in my opinion and I also don't think War/Mnk is all that special either.  However, they can deal a lot of damage if played right.

<br />

<br />
Oh really? Time for some education! 
<br />

<br />
Hit for hit, the only thing Dark Knights have over Warriors is a few extra attack bonuses. They have equal Strength, Dexterity, and Great Axes and Scythes have very close damage ratings.
<br />

<br />
However, Warriors come blessed with the best melee abilities in the game. Berserk is God-sent. 25% boost in attack 3/5 of the time makes a huge difference. Double Attack can effectively make them attack twice and work in WSes as well. You can potentially do a 10 hit Pentathrust. Let's face it-Double Attack rocks. At 35, we get Warcry, which is decent. It is about as effective as Last Resort, but on the whole party. Not great, but it helps. At 45, we get Aggressor. Every single other melee job wants this, but can't. This works like Berserk, except raises Accuracy and lowers Evasion. Using it before a multi-hit WS practically ensures all hits will in fact hit the mob.
<br />

<br />
With the exception of Soul Eater, DRK abilities suck. Last Resort is lame, it acts like Provoke and adds LESS attack boosts than Berserk and lasts 1/10 of the time. It can only really be used for a slight boost before a WS. Soul Eater is THE defining Dark Knight ability. Any DRK that doesn't use Soul Eater should switch to Warrior. Any DRK that abuses Soul Eater will end up dead. It is very tricky to use, but when used properly, it sends you damage output through the roof. Is it enough to make DRK more powerful than Warrior? If subbing Warrior and used properly, yes. At certain points in the game, that is. Until level 50, Double Attack can make up for this. At 45, Warriors get an ability DRKs can never get, Aggressor. From 50 on, an extremely good Dark Knight can overpower a Warrior, but there aren't many of those around. And that is not including WSes.
<br />

<br />
Weapon skills: Warriors get better Weapon Skills. The Breaks=Secks. Rampage=Secks. When DRKs get Guillotine, Warriors gets Raging Rush. DRK WSes SUCK until level 60. Even then, Raging Rush and Guillotine are about equal. Seriously, Slice is their most powerful one for a large portion of the game. Dark Knights can use a Great Axe to try to offset this, but they can't do it as effectively. Dark Knights have to sub Warrior to be effective, missing out on Sneak Attack. And until level 50, there is absolutely no chance of getting the Four-hit OMGWTF 1,000 damage Sturmwind. Once they reach level 3 skillchains, DRK will do more damage on the WS. However, DRKs pretty much need to sub THF from then on and Warriors will therefore do a lot more damage otherwise. From 65/66+, DRK/WAR&gt;WAR&gt;DRK/THF in pure damage, and WAR=DRK/WAR=DRK/THF as a whole package.
<br />

<br />
On a side note, DRKs and Warriors don't need to get competitive. Warriors and DRKs go hand in hand as SC partners. Early levels include: Shadow of Death &gt;&gt; Sturmwind (Fragmentation) then later on Vorpal Scythe/Power Slash &gt;&gt; Rampaging Axe (Distortion), then at 60, Guillotine &gt;&gt; Raging Rush (Fragmentation again), and finally up high Mistral Axe &gt;&gt; Spinning Slash (Light SC). Warrior and Dark Knight are the perfect team. They can fight anything effectively at any point in the game. Throw in Paladin and you've got an unstoppable force.
<br />

<br />

<br />
And one more thing: At higher levels, it gets difficult to tank as a Warrior. Warriors get a D in Vitality, hell even Dark Knights get higher than that. What Warrior DOES get is Provoke. Provoke allows them to sub more tank-worthy subjobs, like Monk and use it to its advantage. Monk, in theory, would make an awesome tank. HP of Gods, tied with Paladin for the highest VIT, Counter, etc. etc. etc. etc. Even Dodge helps! Their problem is that they get paper armor. Warriors can sub Monk and get all their advantages, but have the ability to equip heavy armor. Or they could sub Ninja and have blink at their disposal. Other jobs can't do this to tank since they do not have Provoke. While a Warrior tank is plausible, it gets difficult at higher levels. You pretty much have to be a Galka to make a great Warrior tank, but it can be done. AntiMatter has been talking about this for a while, we really want to test out a WAR/MNK tank 1-75. We strongly believe that it can work out! The thing is, Warrior usually makes a much more efficient DD. Dark Knight could probably make a decent tank with higher VIT than WAR, heavy armor, and Drain, but it isn't as effective as just going DD.
<br />

<br />
You caught me, Warrior is my favorite job. I just love everything about it. In my eyes, Warrior is the perfect melee job.
<br />
