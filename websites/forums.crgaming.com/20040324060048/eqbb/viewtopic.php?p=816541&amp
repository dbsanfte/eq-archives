Chapter 7
<br />

<br />
"Rememberance and Reflections."
<br />

<br />
Here we go again, lets see if I can still put out such great stories. Odd enough it seems I have some real fans out there. I'm pretty sure everyone will enjoy this chapter, although chaos might reign supreme. As for everything else, well we'll just see.
<br />

<br />
Things had calmed down a great deal since the previous events from earlier that night. Though there was the fact that Leona's parents insisted that she stay at the cleric's guild house so her wounds could be tended to. There was also the fact that the local mage's where rather upset with not gaining a Reaper specimen, though none would really voice their opinion. In truth the reason behind this was they feared they could angry Ryo, which is someone they now had proof was more fierce than a Demon was.
<br />

<br />
After the traumatic experience the earlier, Sir William had brought Nadia back to the guild house. In truth he was probably in more shock that Nadia was from the whole incident. She believed fully that no matter what Ryo was, he would of never intentionally hurt either her or Sir William.  Still, Nadia was even more curious now that someone else seemed to have the same strength as Ryo, and she was determined to find out as much as she could. This was one of the many reasons she asked to stay in the same room as Leona. She couldn't think of a better way than to ask someone who had witnessed the event themselves.
<br />

<br />
"So why did you ask to stay in here anyway? Besides taking care of me that is."
<br />

<br />
"I was hoping you might be able to tell me something about the young man you where with."
<br />

<br />
"That Jerk?! I swear all he seems to be good for is attracting attention! I never got into this kind of trouble with my other..."
<br />

<br />
"Oh so you and him are seeing one another?"
<br />

<br />
"Absolutely not! It's all our parents idea. It's a rather long story, but..."
<br />

<br />
"Oh please go on! I want to learn as much as I can about your friend."
<br />

<br />
For once Leona had a chance to actually talk to someone, even though should couldn't figure out why Nadia has such an interest in Zenki. Telling a story certainly was a lot better than letting her mind stay idle. After all she was curious about why all the events had taken place as well, perhaps telling the story might give her some insight at least.
<br />

<br />
"I guess it really all started when my father disapproved of my last boyfriend, though I'm surprised my father tried to incinerate him all over a simple kiss. Which is why I ended up taking up lessons abroad."
<br />

<br />
"Sounds like your father is still protective of you."
<br />

<br />
"Well eventually they asked me to meet them in Qeynos, seems I caught Zenki spying on me while I was taking a bath at the inn I was staying at."
<br />

<br />
"Well that certainly is an odd way to meet."
<br />

<br />
"Not only that, but the little creep stole my cloths. I had to chase him all over Qeynos and I still didn't get them back, even with the help of some of the local women."
<br />

<br />
"Sounds like he's pretty quick on his feet, or very tricky."
<br />

<br />
"Oh he's quick all right, and not under pulling some sneaky tricks. When I finally caught up with him he was hiding in his parents house, in which my parents where visiting at the time."
<br />

<br />
"So both your parents are friends then, that explains why the sudden arrangement."
<br />

<br />
"No kidding, I did my best to get out of the arrangement by going as far as to try and kill Zenki, I'm still not sure how he was capable of that part yet, no one has ever been fast enough to avoid my spells."
<br />

<br />
"You seem pretty skilled as a sorceress, so exactly what happened when you confronted Zenki?"
<br />

<br />
"I tried to finish him off with Sunstrike, but everything seems hazy afterwards, I remember him using something to nullify it, and I know for certain it wasn't any kind of spell."
<br />

<br />
To Nadia this seemed oddly like what she had witnessed from Ryo, in the fact that he seemed to have a great resistance to fire. There was also the fact that he had unbelievable fighting skills, much like some of the elder monks she had seen training. In truth this was all beginning to bring up some more questions, mostly about how it seemed that Zenki had these strange abilities.
<br />

<br />
"In order to pay for the damages we caused, our parents where making us run some errands, as well as some supplies from Qeynos to Freeport here. That's where we encountered the first demons I had ever seen."
<br />

<br />
"I would imagine they where much like the ones that appeared here, am I right?"
<br />

<br />
"They were very different, they seemed more human, and from what I could tell they didn't have the strength that the one you probably seen did."
<br />

<br />
"So it sounds like there are more than one type of demon then."
<br />

<br />
"I would guess so, I'm not entirely certain what happened, but I think when we where attacked that some kind of ability was released in Zenki. He went completely berserk, it was as if the power he had was controlling him."
<br />

<br />
"I assume that he destroyed the two demons then?"
<br />

<br />
"That's right, and as soon as the fight was over something transported us near here."
<br />

<br />
"I'm not really sure I should tell you about the condition Zenki arrived in..."
<br />

<br />
It was now time for Leona to be curious, since she hadn't gave much thought to just how extreme Zenki's injuries had been. In truth from his outward appearance he didn't seem to be injured much, there were no bruises, even though he did have a few scratches. In her mind she began to remember the fight as she tried to determine just what Nadia was about to say.
<br />

<br />
"You see, when he arrived it was determined that most of Zenki's wounds where on his left side. This included his collar bone, shoulder, and the majority of the bones in his left arm which seemed to be completely shattered."
<br />

<br />
"In laymen's terms..."
<br />

<br />
"It means that it should of been nearly impossible for Zenki to fight, even with the treatments we had been giving him."
<br />

<br />
"So will he be all right?"
<br />

<br />
"It will be awhile before we can really tell that."
<br />

<br />
In truth, Zenki had just began to regain consciousness in the next room over. The most noticeable thing was that the entire upper left side of his body seemed to be numb. When his eyes finally came into focus he could see the room around him, it seemed plain and barren. After finally sitting up and taking a closer look around it only seemed natural that he figure out just where he was, and more importantly where Leona had gotten to.
<br />

<br />
"Wonderful... First she wrecks my life, then my dreams, and now she off doing who knows what..."
<br />

<br />
One thing that plagued Zenki's mind was why his numb arm was bandaged so methodically. If anything he could tell just by looking that the wrappings where more or less to restrict movement rather than do much else. Curiosity finally got the better of him as he began to unravel the bandage around his arm, exposing what only looked like minor scratches. It wasn't until he moved his fingers with his unharmed hand that he realized just why the bandage had been placed.
<br />

<br />
All he could feel was grinding of the rough edges of bones, this had a somewhat sobering effect on Zenki's mind. He was now thankful his arm was numb, otherwise he would probably be screaming loud enough for a deaf man to even hear him. Still the idea of finding out where he was had taken over as he stood up and grasp the handle of the door.
<br />

<br />
So far all he could tell was that he wasn't exactly considered a threat to everyone, mainly because the door was left unlocked. There was also the fact that the hallway outside was without a guard, at least he could rest at ease for awhile as he took time to observe the hallway. At first glance it was mostly barren, and had several doors, possibly to rooms much like the one he was at. Towards the end of the hallway was a window with a staircase both heading down and up, at the other end was a door.
<br />

<br />
All in all things didn't seem that bad, of course he had no idea how many floors below was the ground floor, or for that matter how many upper floors there where. It was now time for him to try his old skills of deception once more as he began to blend in with the shadows. This way Zenki knew for sure he could have a chance at finding out just what all was happening.
<br />

<br />
Zenki focused his hearing, and naturally moved down the hallway towards the door at the end, the source of some faint noise. Of course finding out what was going on inside was going to be tougher, he could definitely feel moist air from the edge of the door. Then the sound of footsteps beyond the door made him uneasy, as his luck would have it he managed to duck behind the door as several women exited. Least now he knew what the room was as he managed to slip past them all and just inside the door.
<br />

<br />
Years of sneaking around for his Grandpa and doing little errands here and there had helped him learn the arts of steal much faster than most people. Zenki knew that staying out of the direct view of people was the best way to keep from being caught. Only one person had ever managed to actually give him any problems by seeing through his skills, and that was none other than Leona. The absolute worst thing was about to happen though as one of the women knocked on the door next to the room he was just in.
<br />

<br />
"Hey Nadia, the bath area is open if you like."
<br />

<br />
"Okay! We'll be right there."
<br />

<br />
Sure enough within a few minutes Zenki could hear footsteps coming down the hallway, from the sound as well as timing he could tell there was at least two people. The only chance he had was to hide in the most shadowed corner in the room and hope his abilities where still as sharp as they had been in the past. His mind soon became a blank as he seen another woman and Leona step into the room and close the door.
<br />

<br />
"So Nadia, why where you so interested in hearing about that jerk Zenki?"
<br />

<br />
"Oh, you mean you've never heard the demon legend of Freeport."
<br />

<br />
"I can't say that I have."
<br />

<br />
"Well it tells of a young man with crimson red hair and eyes of the blackest night. This demon as they called it was responsible for killing close to fifty or so trolls and ogres who attacked Freeport."
<br />

<br />
"So why do they call a person like that a demon?"
<br />

<br />
"Well this same person also broke Sir Williams arm with ease, which is the person who has been telling this legend. Earlier we came face to face with this person when he fought and killed a Reaper with just his bare hands."
<br />

<br />
Never before had the perfect opportunity for Zenki to make money had presented itself so easily, not only that, but was also learning some from the conversation. He though for certain the dirty old man that his grandpa was would have certainly paid out the nose for a chance to see this. He let his mind waver for a moment as he stared at the two women as they undressed, then slipped into the pool of water before him.
<br />

<br />
"So you wouldn't happen to know this persons name would you?"
<br />

<br />
"He said his name was Ryo Kataoka, any idea's of who he is?"
<br />

<br />
"I would guess that he's... Maybe he's Zenki's uncle, because earlier I met his aunt, she was very nice for a dark elf."
<br />

<br />
"You must be talking about Rita, yes she is nice. I've seen her son a couple of times before with the local monks."
<br />

<br />
"He must stick out like a sore thumb amongst the other people of this city."
<br />

<br />
"Actually he doesn't, the only real difference from him and us humans is his eyes."
<br />

<br />
"I bet he's nicer than Zenki is, all that jerk does is make rude comments about me."
<br />

<br />
This was unbelievable, if it wasn't for him being injured, or for the fact that someone else was in the room Zenki would of given Leona a piece of his mind. It was one thing to outright insult him face to face, but it was a new matter all together to insult someone when they couldn't defend themselves. To make matters even worse, the numbness in his arm was starting to ebb, things definitely were not looking good for now.
<br />

<br />
"Maybe he likes you and just doesn't want anyone to know? In the least you should at least try to be nice to him now."
<br />

<br />
"I suppose your right, he was injured pretty badly, and he did manage to save me."
<br />

<br />
Zenki began to weigh his options, either he could come straight out and cause a scene, or he could hope they would finish before the pain became to intense. The first of the two didn't seem possible at all, and the second wasn't looking hopeful. His only other choice it seemed was to try to make it to the door before Leona could find him like she did before.
<br />

<br />
It was slow and painful as Zenki began to move from the corner, doing his best to keep his attention on staying out of their view. The pain was becoming agonizing now as he neared the door, beads of sweat where beginning to form on his forehead. Just as he neared the door he stopped, taking great care to observe Leona for the perfect time to slide open the door and leave.
<br />

<br />
"This kind of reminds me of how I met Zenki, he probably never knew what he did wrong to get caught."
<br />

<br />
"He sounds pretty sneaky, so just how did you find him?"
<br />

<br />
"He made the mistake of casting a shadow over the water, that was a dead give away."
<br />

<br />
With hearing that he had a new plan to make sure he wouldn't be seen. All he would do was duck down, and hope that the light from the hallway couldn't be seen as he exited. This way he thought they would dismiss it as the door not being shut all the way to begin with. Of course to test this theory he would basically be hoping for the best.
<br />

<br />
Zenki did his best possible given his injures as he crouched down and carefully opened the door. It didn't take long for him to move outside the room, giving him a chance to stand up behind the door. He now had time to finally relax somewhat, and in doing so made a dreadful mistake as he closed the door to quickly.
<br />

<br />
This instantly tipped off Leona that something had happened to the door, she always had a sixth sense about people watching her. She moved from the water without saying a word and wrapped herself in a towel, she was going to teach who ever it was a lesson they would never forget. Much to her surprise when she threw open the door she seen no one. That didn't deter her though as she instinctively began to search for signs of movement.
<br />

<br />
He couldn't believe his horrid luck, or for that matter his foolishness with the door. That didn't matter now, cause Zenki knew that if he was seen he would be in much worse trouble than he was before. Fate wasn't on his side as his injured arm twitched from the pain surging through it, causing a audible snapping sound as bone moved against bone.
<br />

<br />
"Nadia your going to have to excuse the rudeness, but I think I just found a peeping tom."
<br />

<br />
Leona swung her open palm through the air where she heard the noise come from and struck home. The palm had landed perfect across one of Zenki's cheeks, which in turn caused him to fully appear before her. She couldn't believe he would do this again after the first time, and now it looks like she was going to have to teach him another lesson.
<br />

<br />
"Okay that's it! So you want to spy on us you pervert?!"
<br />

<br />
"No! Wait! It's not what it looks like honest!"
<br />

<br />
"I'm going to give you what you deserve!"
<br />

<br />
"Ah! No! Wait!!! Let me explain!"
<br />

<br />
Nadia burst into laughter as she seen Leona drag Zenki off to his room, she didn't believe she would hurt him, but she just had to be certain. With that decided she began to dress as fast as she could. All this time the two could be heard shouting at each other in the room.
<br />

<br />
"Ah, Stop with the pulling!"
<br />

<br />
"Shut up! It's not like its going to kill you!"
<br />

<br />
"Let go! It's to tight!"
<br />

<br />
"Quiet! You'll disturb everyone else!"
<br />

<br />
"Get off of me all ready!"
<br />

<br />
"If you would stop squirming this would go faster!"
<br />

<br />
"Don't you have any decency?!"
<br />

<br />
It was then that Nadia had reached the room and opened the door. The scene before her made her face turn to deep crimson as she blushed. She had to admit though, Leona certainly was determined in what she was doing. Especially given the fact that even though her towel had come off she was still straddling Zenki, though she could understand why he had been complaining so much, anyone would given how roughly she had reapplied the bandages to his arm.
<br />

<br />
"See that wasn't so bad was it?"
<br />

<br />
"Zenki, why do you have your eyes covered?"
<br />

<br />
"Cause after the last time I seen her she tried to kill me!"
<br />

<br />
"I'm not that cruel, even I wouldn't hit you when your hurt."
<br />

<br />
Leona quickly grabbed her towel once again and covered herself. She knew after this she wouldn't have to hit him. Though she did feel bad about being so rough with him, as well as the fact she had been so cold to him in the past. Of course she knew with the way Zenki was now, he had probably considered this all to be some sick sort of torture.
<br />

<br />
"One question, just where the heck are we, and further more, what's her name?"
<br />

<br />
"Well your at the cleric's guild house in Freeport, and her name is Nadia."
<br />

<br />
"I've been taking care of you since you got here."
<br />

<br />
"I'm lucky to be alive dealing with all this just now."
<br />

<br />
"You big baby! It couldn't have hurt that much!"
<br />

<br />
"Actually Leona, what you did was probably worse than any torture, I'm sure that he was in a lot of pain."
<br />

<br />
"Let's go to bed, and Zenki, don't you dare think of spying on us while we're asleep."
<br />

<br />
"After what just happened, I'd rather got to sleep than risk being attended to by you again."
<br />

<br />
With that all said both Leona and Nadia returned to their room, leaving Zenki to wonder just what lay in store for him in the morning. He seriously doubted that anything else that could happen to him could compare to being taken care of by Leona. In his opinion anything else could of been better than what just happened. Sleep finally came though as he wondered, just what was going to take place in the morning...

So much so that after watching the End of Evangelion movie that somehow I understood it the first time around. At the moment I'm holding a great deal of what I want to write back simply because I post it on my guilds website and younger people tend to read it.

Chapter 8
<br />

<br />
"Blood Frenzy."
<br />

<br />

<br />
Over the past several days the people of Felwithe had managed to catch glimpses of Janus as he would come outside for brief moments of time. The guards by now knew better than to bother him, and most people didn't see him as any sort of threat now. If anything since he had managed to save all the prisoners from Crushbone he was now viewed as a hero. After all if anything he did have a kind nature to him even though he did seem slightly withdrawn.
<br />

<br />
Throughout this time Iris had came to visit him each day, and though she tried to her best to learn more about him she simply couldn't get a solid answer out of him. Of course her parents weren't much help either in this matter. Neither of them would mention anything about Janus's father, which is something that was eating away at her curiosity.
<br />

<br />
If anything she wanted to learn more of just how Janus could fight so well. She wanted to see what people seemed to revere about people who trained in the fighting styles of monks. Today she had a feeling things would be different and that she'd find the answers to her questions.
<br />

<br />
Today of all days she had decided to follow Janus as he left the cleric's guild, and made his way toward the city gates. Everyday since he had been able to walk he had left the city to do something. No one just had a clue just what he was doing, but with each trip out the guards would notice the Orcs would retreat to their stronghold. The creatures held a great fear for this young man, one that could drive away the most fierce of them.
<br />

<br />
In the forest things where silent, save for the sound of several birds chirping. It was like this most mornings and today seemed to be no different. Morning dew hung to the blades of grass and a fine mist still covered the forest's floor. This was the perfect setting, Janus had been trained since the day he could walk for battle, and his father had always instructed him it was best to train early in the morning. Today like every other day he was going to follow his fathers words, and go through what he would call his normal routine.
<br />

<br />
Iris had followed him today though, in hopes of discovering more about this person she had only recently just met. She wanted to see with her own eyes just what he did each morning, and perhaps some of the things that Janus wouldn't tell her about. Many a time she had asked him just what he did each morning and his only reply was the word "practice", he simply wouldn't say another word other than that.
<br />

<br />
It was this day that Janus had decided to test the full limits of his abilities. He was curious about how he had managed to survive the events at Crushbone, as well as having recovered so quickly.  With a quick leap to the side he had begun the routine, by forcing himself up into the air by the use of a nearby tree. Once in the air time seemed to slow down for him, as he went through his beginning kata.
<br />

<br />
This sight mystified Iris as she watched on from her vantage point which was off in the distance hidden within the brush. It was clear to her that Janus could move much faster than anyone she had ever seen before. The only thing that could come close to this speed was the quickness of her father as he set about using his bow.
<br />

<br />
All this was done without thought, without having to concentrate. The many years of training had made this more like an instinct rather than anything else to Janus. Once he landed upon the ground he knew that he was ready to continue. If anything he had gotten much faster, which made him thing that perhaps now he could move at close to the same speed as his father.
<br />

<br />
It was now time he tried some of the more advanced technique's he had seen his father use. This was something he knew full well that he might not be able to try, since it required a great deal upon bringing out his latent talents as his father would refer to them. Still this didn't mean he couldn't try, if he could do this on his own then he knew his father would teach him more.
<br />

<br />
The shadows of the surrounding area appeared to almost retreat for a moment as Janus set into what Iris thought was a strange pose. It was then that all sounds of life stopped in the forest as if everything had now focused its attention of something. The only exception to this where the brownie's who only came here to torment the younger adventurers.
<br />

<br />
Before Iris's eyes she seen something that would have stumped even the greatest wizards of Felwithe. The reasoning behind this was that Janus's body would occasionally flicker with a dim crimson aura around it. She could tell the look upon his face was of nothing but pure concentration on something.
<br />

<br />
If anything he was dishearten now, he had failed once again to do what his father could. He simply couldn't understand what it was he was doing wrong. A quick look at the sky told him he had spent a great deal of time today, even the mist was gone. Soon he knew that Iris would be on her to the guild house to ask him questions.
<br />

<br />
Janus could understand why she was so curious, but he had taken an oath with his father to keep certain matters a secret. There was some reason that his father didn't want people to find out what they could truly do. One thing his father told him was that people would try to destroy what they don't understand, for fear of it.
<br />

<br />
This all ran through his mind as he leapt into the tree's and began moving from one to another back towards Felwithe. After all this was the fastest way to get back there, though he was sure the locals would probably be scared witless if they seen him doing this. Though he knew they would be far more accepting of this kind behavior than the people of Freeport would. 
<br />

<br />
Instead of instantly going to hound Janus with questions Iris decided to instead go back to the place where a band of adventures where suppose to have saved the entire Faydwer continent. The legend was that a great evil appeared and that a single man containing the souls of two sacrificed himself here to delay the evil from spreading. One thing the lore included was the fact that several others fought along side this person until they where forcibly taken away at the wishes of the man who held two souls.
<br />

<br />
The area that the battle was said to have taken place still bore great scars in the earth, the kinds that gave druids like Iris chills when they seen them. The trees in the surrounding area had only just begun to recover from the events from the distant past. It was obvious that indeed something had happened here, and that at least some of the legend was true. Iris could still feel the ebbing of an evil presence as well as two others that seemed to be almost intertwined.
<br />

<br />
Little had Iris known that she had been followed by someone who seemed to be shrouded in the very shadows themselves. In fact she hadn't even noticed this person step out into the light. It was only when this person finally spoke that she realized that anyone was there at all. 
<br />

<br />
"So your curiosity has brought you here has it?"
<br />

<br />
"I just wanted to know more about what happened here, especially since my parents and Janus's where somehow involved here."
<br />

<br />
"I suppose that's only natural to want to know those things, but then again it all depends on how much you truly want to know."
<br />

<br />
"I'd like to know just who Janus's father is, and why my parents don't want to talk about him. Also I'd like to know what happened here."
<br />

<br />
"Ah, very good questions. Janus's father is a man known as Ryo Kataoka. He's not what you could call a very social person."
<br />

<br />
"Exactly what does that mean Sir?"
<br />

<br />
"He tends to come off as being somewhat hostile, or cruel. In other words he's not very nice to people in general."
<br />

<br />
"That would explain a little about why my parents won't talk about him, but what about what happened here?"
<br />

<br />
"Well a person known as Xernoss sought to control the world, at the time Ryo was sharing a body with a man known as Shoken. The difference between the two is like night and day, hence the legend about a person containing two souls. From what I seen of the battle it was long and fierce, in the end the two destroyed themselves to protect their friends, which included your parents."
<br />

<br />
"If they killed themselves, then how is it that Ryo can still be alive?"
<br />

<br />
"I would suspect some divine intervention happened, but even such is a mystery to someone like myself. I try to remain as a watcher, interfering as little as possible in events that take place here."
<br />

<br />
For a moment Iris turned to look at the surroundings contemplating just what had occurred here so long ago. When she turned back the strange had disappeared just as easily as he had came. With what she now knew, more questions began to present themselves. These included wanting to know more about Ryo, and this other person called Shoken.
<br />

<br />
As the fates would have it, or by some twisted coincidence three figures had been watching this whole ordeal. In truth they had been spying on Iris ever since they found out she was some how connected with Janus. This knowledge was going to make things much easier on them since luring him out by using her as bait was the perfect way to catch him alone.
<br />

<br />
Since the incident at Crushbone they had been taking their time to study this person who had killed their brethren. They had all agreed that his death was going to be slow and painful, by the likes of which no person living or deceased had ever experienced. This was going to be something they all knew they would become famous for in later years.
<br />

<br />
Not only was all of this going to earn them great respect in the circles they traveled, but after hearing of this young mans lineage they knew they could be greatly rewarded. The bounty that had been put on this young man's father also extended to all of his family. This alone gave them more incentive to go through with their revenge.
<br />

<br />
Everything happened so quickly that even the most trained of eyes would have had a hard time telling what went on. The three Teir'Dal felt on her much like buzzards on a carcass, showing no compassion. This was a simple pleasure they would enjoy, having bound and gagged her just as they had done to so many before. 
<br />

<br />
Excruciating pain was all that Iris felt as her captors pulled her by the hair through the forest towards Felwithe. They showed no remorse for causing her such pain, in fact they enjoyed it. If anything this was making their day much more enjoyable. Not only would they be rewarded handsomely upon returning home, but they where going to have their share of fun tormenting Iris along the way.
<br />

<br />
"It looks like taking this assignment here on Faydwer wasn't such a bad choice after all."
<br />

<br />
"Of course it wasn't, we're already going to earn enough to buy our own block in Neriak, as well as having a bit of fun in the process."
<br />

<br />
"I'd rather much have my fun with that bastard who killed our brethren in Crushbone."
<br />

<br />
"I'll take it you want be the first one to torture our prey who's hiding in Felwithe."
<br />

<br />
"Certainly, you can have all the fun you want with the girl in the meantime, just as long as I get to pulverize her boyfriend."
<br />

<br />
It wasn't long before the trio neared the guards posted just outside the cities gates. This was the kind of situation that no one would ever have been prepared for. The guards had no choice but to hold their positions as several more people came out to see the spectacle before them. Everything for them was going to plan thus far, and they where certain it wouldn't take long for them to get who they where after.
<br />

<br />
"Let the girl go you Teir'Dal scum."
<br />

<br />
"Bring us the man who freed our slaves from Crushbone and we might consider it."
<br />

<br />
"You'll let the girl go now or die."
<br />

<br />
"I beg to differ, if you so much as move we'll torture her here and now."
<br />

<br />
The guards had little choice in this matter, none wanted to see such a young beauty mangled before their eyes. Certainly if they did do something wrong and her parents where to find out then they could most likely expect severe punishment the likes of which no one has ever experienced before. There only option was to stand at this stalemate, and hope that somehow things could be worked out.
<br />

<br />
This was the kind of message that no one felt like delivering to Janus. No one had any idea of how her parents would react at hearing this either. When it came to informing loved ones about some drastic situation the words never came easy. It was by luck at both Iris's parents and Janus where having a conversation in his room, which was put to a halt with the words they where about to hear.
<br />

<br />
"I'm sorry to inform the three of you that Iris is being held captive outside the gates."
<br />

<br />
"Our little girl is what?!"
<br />

<br />
"Who has her?!"
<br />

<br />
Janus left without hesitation, or for that matter stopping to ask just who had capture Iris. This was something that none of them would have expected. Daxster was surprised since it did indeed seem that this young man hadn't inherited his fathers cold nature. Though it was obvious to Selena just what was going on, she had a good idea of just what Janus could be feeling.
<br />

<br />
Everyone who was in the way soon found themselves shoved out of the way as Janus ran towards the gates. He wasn't going to let anyone harm Iris, and he certainly wasn't going to stand by and do nothing. If anything he owed her his life after hearing what she had done in the square, and deep inside he knew it would take the rest of his life to pay that debt back.
<br />

<br />
The guards at the gates tried to stop him with all their might, only they found themselves overpowered and shoved to the side as Janus made his way through the crowd. The sight he seen before him revolted him, to see Iris bound and gagged in such a manner. It was giving him the same feeling he felt at Crushbone, which he was now fighting to repress for fear of what it might unleash.
<br />

<br />
"Let her go!"
<br />

<br />
"We might, once we're finished with you."
<br />

<br />
"Your not going to finish anything."
<br />

<br />
Janus went to move forward, only to see the glint of a daggers blade as it was pressed against Iris's throat. He now had no option other than to go along with what they wanted, or else he knew they would slit her throat without a second thought. In all his years of living in Freeport he had learned just how heartless the Teir'Dal could be. This meant he couldn't take anything they said lightly, especially when it came to Iris's life.
<br />

<br />
"Just what do you want."
<br />

<br />
"We want your death. We want you to die an excruciating death like our brethren in Crushbone did."
<br />

<br />
"I'll let you do what you want, as long as she's let go."
<br />

<br />
"She'll only be released when your dead."
<br />

<br />
There was a moment of silence and then once again Janus did something that people would forever remember. He stepped out from the guards with a solemn look upon his face, ready to face death. This went far beyond what anyone had seen anyone do for another, so much so that even the guards knew from that day forward Janus would become a legend that they could tell their children about.
<br />

<br />
"Do your worst..."
<br />

<br />
In a flash two of the Teir'Dal leapt into action, their swords ready to cleave into Janus's flesh. The two dark elves went to work just as they had been trained as blood began to sling from their blades as they repeatedly lashed out with their swords. They intended this to be long and painful as they purposely aimed their swords for just Janus's skin alone.
<br />

<br />
This was viewed with horror by the crowd that had gathered at the gates. They knew there was nothing they could do, not in a situation like this. All there hopes lay in that somehow something would happen to stop this atrocity that was happening before their eyes. None of the could of expected what was going to happen though.
<br />

<br />
"It's time we finished him, and got on about our business."
<br />

<br />
The two Teir'Dal that where attacking Janus stopped and held their hands out towards him. The onlookers knew this was the end as they seen a thick blackened fog encircle the young mans body, hiding it completely from view. Evil permeated through the air from the fog, they where now sure this was the last time they would see Janus alive.
<br />

<br />
All this was passing by slowly for Janus, he withstood the intense pain in hopes that he could think of a way to free Iris. At last the fog surrounded him and enclosed his world in darkness. Though unexplained, he could feel his strength as well as his very life force beginning to drain away. It was then that he began to lose hope, though some voice kept telling him to stay the course, to fight back.
<br />

<br />
- I can't believe your thinking of giving up. If only you would stop holding back. -
<br />

<br />
- If I fight back and lose control everyone here could be harmed. -
<br />

<br />
- How many times have you seen your own father fight? -
<br />

<br />
- I've seen him fight to many times to count. -
<br />

<br />
- If he didn't lose control, then you won't lose control either. Your his son aren't you?! -
<br />

<br />
- I'm not the same person as my father! -
<br />

<br />
- For as cold and cruel your father is to outsiders, he's always lent his hand in protecting the innocent. Though he won't admit it with words, he does so with actions. -
<br />

<br />
- I can't fight like my father though. -
<br />

<br />
- You can't fight like him because your always holding back! -
<br />

<br />
- I can't fight, if I do Iris will be killed! -
<br />

<br />
- And if you don't fight back Iris will be killed anyway, after she's beaten and abused just as the two others you killed before would have done to her. -
<br />

<br />
For a moment the fog thinned before Janus's eyes and he could see the dagger being pressed into Iris's neck. He could see ever scratch and bruise that was on her body from being treated so roughly. Once again his eyes focused on the dagger, and the tip of the blade where he could clearly see blood being drawn.
<br />

<br />
Something inside of Janus yearned to be set free at this sight. It was a feeling similar to the one he had felt inside Crushbone, but this was far more intense. He was beginning to instinctively fight against the pain being inflicted on his body. It was then that he decided what he was going to do.
<br />

<br />
- Will you fight now? -
<br />

<br />
- I can't let this go on. I'm going to stop this right here and now! -
<br />

<br />
The earth itself began to shudder as if some great force where being summoned forth. Everyone who stood before the black fog that surrounded Janus began to back away, they could some how feel something beginning to gather strength, but they where uncertain of what it was. Only two could have expected what they where all about to witness.
<br />

<br />
Both of Iris's parents had an idea of what was about to happen, they had seen it before from Janus's father. They now knew for certain that their daughter would soon be freed. In their hearts they could feel the power that Janus was about to unleash. Now everyone would see just how come Mayong Mistmoore had defeated.
<br />

<br />
"Let her go now!!!"
<br />

<br />
The ground beneath the fog shattered as a bright crimson glow began to break through in various spots. Then everyone heard the enraged scream of a man pushed far beyond his limits, of one who even the masters of hell themselves would think twice about angering. There was a flash of red light and then the fog was gone, leaving only Janus standing.
<br />

<br />
It was clear that something had happened to Janus while inside the fog. Everyone could clearly see that the whites of his eyes had taken on a crimson glow. Most notable was his hair, then ends of his hairs had taken on a deep bloody red ton to them. If anything he looked somewhat like what most people would have called a demon.
<br />

<br />
"I said let her go now..."
<br />

<br />
"Kill him!"
<br />

<br />
The dark elf would never utter another order in its life, Janus was certain on that. He had slipped by the other two Teir'Dal and had locked his hands into the sides of Iris's captor. There was a splash of blood followed by bone fragments and gray brain matter as the dark elf's head practically exploded between Janus's hands.
<br />

<br />
The two remaining Teir'Dal where in shock at the sight before them. Their once living comrade was now nothing but a head corpse which was twitching on the ground. Blood began to stain the ground beneath Janus's feet, turning the once lush green foliage a dark gruesome red. There was a cold, steely gaze from his eyes as he once again turned to his would be tormentors.
<br />

<br />
It was then the two made a  mistake they would never get a chance to correct. They both rushed at Janus with their swords ready to cut down this man who had now managed to murder three of their own kind. Now they where about to experience something that would be reserved for only the most cruel of people.
<br />

<br />
In a single deft move Janus tore the swords from his foes grasp and then went about putting them to a grizzly use. What the crowd seen before them was both shocking and yet they felt this was justice being done as the Teir'Dal before them where systematically separated from every other part of themselves.
<br />

<br />
Now what stood before them was a scene that would have even made the executioners cringe with terror. Blood and bone fragments along with various body parts where strewn across the ground, and Janus stood before them. He was scanning the area for yet another who would attack him.
<br />

<br />
Janus's eyes turned down to Iris, who had long since passed out from witnessing all the gore. This was all that he wanted now, for her to be safe, and in turn this sated his anger. With a quick snap here and there the ropes that bound her form where removed along with her gag. Not a word was spoke as he lifted her up into his arms and carried her back inside the safety of Felwithe...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

Chapter 9
<br />

<br />
"The Search for Janus Begins."
<br />

<br />
As some people know I've taken a break from writing, I assure you it was due to technical issues as well as leveling a necro from 53 all the way up to 58 in about a months time. I did lose the majority of my files on my computer due to an WinXP system break down. Lucky for me I had everything saved except for the beginning page of this chapter. I'll admit the first page wasn't like this at all and so I've decided just to begin anew.
<br />

<br />

<br />
It was all Rita could do to keep from going into hysterics at what she heard. She would have never thought anything like this would of happened. It was now apparent that all that was said had taken place after all Selena and Daxster surely would lie to her right in front of her this very moment. Clearly something was going to have to be done now, she wanted to make sure her son was found and saved.
<br />

<br />
"Honestly we're sorry Rita, we had no idea things would have turned out like this."
<br />

<br />
"We came as soon as we could, it was all we could do to keep Iris from coming as well."
<br />

<br />
At having said this Selena flashed Daxster a look, this was one of the many ways their daughter took after her father. She did have to admit though, they both had the tendency to act that way when they where younger. Still she knew when her daughter took more after her than her father and vice versa.
<br />

<br />
"It's all right, I don't blame either of you two. If anything Janus's father is more to blame for this than anyone else."
<br />

<br />
"How was I to know he would run off, or that any of this would happen?"
<br />

<br />
"You could have went yourself you know!"
<br />

<br />
"I had other things to do, you know that Rita."
<br />

<br />
"I was talking about how you refused to teach him more about his powers."
<br />

<br />
"We've discussed this before, it would be better for him to discover them on his own. No amount of lecturing could have described to him what would happen."
<br />

<br />
With this said Ryo crossed his arms and gave everyone a stern look. He certainly didn't like be accused of doing something wrong. Though now he did feel somewhat responsible for what had happened, but he also knew that he was needed elsewhere at the time.
<br />

<br />
It was at this time that Zenki ran into the house with a frantic look on his face. Of course Rita had seen this look on his father many a time and knew just what was about to happen. She knew Shoken was prone to doing something that would upset Azia, and in turn what ensued would be nothing short of a small moving disaster.
<br />

<br />
"I swear! This time it wasn't my fault, I had no idea she was there!"
<br />

<br />
"Zenki you bastard!!! You think hiding in there is going to save you!!!"
<br />

<br />
"Leona, your overreacting, it must of been an accident."
<br />

<br />
Nadia was the voice of reason, though Leona was far beyond reasoning with him now. She was determined to teach him a lesson, even if he did still have bandages on his arm. All Zenki could do was search around frantically as he searched for a way to escape. During all of this Leona beat on the door, trying to force it open with all her might.
<br />

<br />
During all this Selena and Daxster could only stare at Zenki as he tried to brace himself against the door to keep Leona out. They simply where astonished at how much he resembled his father, but in his facial features as well as his personality. Of course it wasn't long before all of this came to an end, especially since Leona had managed to shove her fist through the door in a failed attempt at trying to grab a hold of Zenki.
<br />

<br />
"She's just as bad as Azia was!"
<br />

<br />
"Selena I'm afraid she's far worse, you haven't heard of the damage she caused in Qeynos."
<br />

<br />
"I'll take your word for it Rita!"
<br />

<br />
It wasn't often that Zenki had a chance to try out anything he had been thinking of the past few days, but this was as good a time as any. After all if it failed he'd get beaten to a pulp, which is what would happen anyway if he didn't do something. It was now or never as Zenki suddenly pulled open the door, causing Leona to come tumbling in across the floor and gave him the perfect chance to make his escape.
<br />

<br />
"Damn you Zenki! Just wait till I get my hands on you!"
<br />

<br />
"Leona calm down! If you don't someone's going to get hurt!"
<br />

<br />
Ryo could hardly keep from laughing as he heard the explosions outside from Leona's assault, along with the screams of the guards who he knew where running for cover. If anything he wasn't fond of the guards here in this city, or any city for that matter. He found that they always gave him suspicious looks, the kind that he'd rather not get from anyone let alone guards.
<br />

<br />
For a long time he had managed to keep himself in check, not revealing what he preferred to call his true form. That hadn't lasted long though, especially since the incident with the Reaper and Sir William. It was a small price to pay though because he knew if he hadn't done something then the creature would of had its way and caused more senseless deaths. All he could do was shrug as he stepped over to the door to watch the commotion that the two where causing outside.
<br />

<br />
Zenki was doing his best to at the time to avoid the barrage of fire that Leona was causing to rain down towards him from above. He had always hated these kinds of spells, particularly since they where hard to avoid, and even harder to control. These there two things Leona knew, in fact she had nearly mastered controlling these types of spells from the very beginning. It didn't matter if it was raw mana, fiery embers, or icy spears. She could control it all at a whim, much like her father could, and this alone was enough to make anyone leery of dealing with her.
<br />

<br />
Of course her tantrum now wasn't making things easier on Zenki as he stepped up the pace of his movements. This only proved to make her temper flare all the more as she stood there before him. She wasn't exactly one to give up, no matter what, if she was determined to do something then it got done. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
It had taken her several days to learn where Freeport was, but she was certain that if she went there should could gain some clues as to why Janus had left so abruptly. She hated going against what her parents wanted, but she felt this was the only way she could help. If anything she couldn't just sit around and wait for the news about Janus.
<br />

<br />
The trip had been hard on her, even though she knew the incantations that sent her to the western commons she had at first been lost. Along the way she had seen many marvelous sights, considering this was actually her first time on Antonica. Though it was most definitely to her advantage to keep her distance as she traveled, particularly from the dark elves she had seen.
<br />

<br />
For the most part every single merchant she had ran across had been kind enough, which suited her just fine. It made finding directions that much easier, and helped to her to learn more about how the people of Freeport interacted with one another. Sometimes she felt uneasy as she traveled, mostly because of how the men tended to stare at her, but she knew this was something she'd have to become accustom to before entering the city.
<br />

<br />
Iris was more than afraid as she came into view of Freeport. Of all the things she had heard she wasn't sure which would be true. It certainly was bigger than Felwithe though, this was something that hadn't been exaggerated. Also one of the many things she had found to be startling where the size of the orcs on Antonica. They where like giants compared to their brethren of Faydwer, which made Iris wonder just how the locals managed to keep them at bay.
<br />

<br />
Just as she expected the guards gawked at her as she walked past them, she could definitely tell they where not of the friendlier type. Long ago she had heard that if she where to travel to Freeport she'd be better protected by the guards of North Freeport rather than the ones found in East or West Freeport. This appeared to be the case now as she made her way past the gates an past a rather large looking ogre vendor.
<br />

<br />
At first sight she was alarmed that they'd let such a person into the city, but after some quick observations she realized he wasn't a danger to her. Closer inspection as she walked through the streets proved that this place welcomed nearly all the races of the world to travel. This was more evident as she seen an leather clad iksar walk down the street, a Bo staff draped across the creatures back.
<br />

<br />
"Excuse me, Mister. But do you know where a family by the name of Kataoka resides here?"
<br />

<br />
"Of courssse young lasssss. They live towards the center of the city."
<br />

<br />
"Thanks kind Sir."
<br />

<br />
"No thanksss are needed, if by chance you see the one they call Ryo, tell him that Monozard would enjoy having another drink with him sssssometime again."
<br />

<br />
After having said that the iksar gave what best could of been described as a smile and continued on its journey. If anything Iris was now nearly in shock, she had heard that iksars where barbaric creatures, and possibly more fierce than even Trolls or Ogres when it came to people outside of their race. It was becoming apparent to her that perhaps there where exceptions to all that she had heard.
<br />

<br />
Iris had no idea of what was waiting her as she came closer to the center of the city. She seen several small pillars of smoke. Of course things began to clear after several armor clad soldiers rushed toward that area. Curiosity got the best of her and she just knew she would have to see what was going on now.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Leona was cursing and swearing enough to make the most hardened of sailors blush from shame. The only thing keeping her from causing more annihilation was several of the guards that where now holding her back. To make things worse Zenki seen that as something as comical as a drunken dwarf trying to run down the street.
<br />

<br />
"Serves you right for making all this mess!"
<br />

<br />
"You little pervert! Wait till I get my hands on you!"
<br />

<br />
"An you call me a pervert? Talk about the pot calling the kettle black!"
<br />

<br />
This was all it took to push Leona over the edge, which by chance the guards first noticed as they where sent sprawling onto their backs from an eruption of pure mana. Of course her sights where set on Zenki, who promptly took this opportunity to run. This suited her just fine because she was determined to fry him no matter where he tried to run to.
<br />
Zenki definitely regretted mouthing off now, he hadn't thought she'd react so violently. Now she was even more angry than before, which only proved to full the power of her spells. It wasn't so much himself he was worried about, it was about the property damage she was causing from all the explosions.
<br />

<br />
Thankfully Zenki was managing to make himself a horrible target for her with the way he was moving. Truthfully people on the street where having a hard time even following his movements. This only seemed to make things more complicated for the guards who where either trying to get out of the way or pursue them through the city.
<br />

<br />
What he was hoping was that she'd soon get tired and be unable to focus enough to cast her spells. Which he knew afterwards things would be much easier, and if anything it would save them the trouble of paying for more damages. Leona wasn't going to have any of it though, she had finally managed to focus on what to do to stop Zenki long enough for her to blast him.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Iris had managed to get close enough to hear the commotion that was going on. She had never before heard so many people in a panic. Not only that, but she could tell the air was being saturated with mana. Whatever was going on, it was evident that who ever was casting these spells was no amateur.
<br />

<br />
She had just reached the center of all the disturbance when a explosion knocked her off her feet. Now she was certain she knew what was happening. It had to of been a someone who was schooled in the airs of wizardry. Little could prepare her for what was about to happen next though, as someone practically fell on her.
<br />

<br />

<br />
In his rush to avoid Leona's latest onslaught Zenki and run right into what he knew from first glance was a wood elf. This slight moment of diversion was just enough time for Leona to finish off her latest spell. It was by far the most crippling of all spells she had, a smile came to her face as she seen the earth come alive and then grasp a hold of Zenki's legs.
<br />

<br />
"Come on Leona, can't we talk about this?!"
<br />

<br />
"There's nothing to talk about you little pervert! I'm going to fry you once and for all!"
<br />

<br />
"Uhm Excuse me Miss? You wouldn't by chance know where I could find a household with the last name of Kataoka would you?"
<br />

<br />
"What do you want with this idiots family?"
<br />

<br />
Zenki was now thanking whatever gods existed for this new distraction. At least it gave Nadia a chance to catch up to them. Which meant just maybe Leona would calm down just enough for him to be spared. Still he knew his best chances at escape would be if he could actually break free of the earthly bonds, which happened to be covering his legs all the way up to his knees.
<br />

<br />
"Well I came in search of someone called Janus. Is he around?"
<br />

<br />
"Leona that's why Zenki came into our room like that, he came to tell us that Janus has gone missing."
<br />

<br />
"Is that so? He should of knocked first you know."
<br />

<br />

<br />
Shoken smiled as he walked through the city, he could tell someone was fighting here and knew that it was most likely his son and Leona. It had been a good idea to pair the two up, he knew full well that even if things came to the worst that at least Zenki could anger Leona and she'd end up blowing up whomever it was that would attack them. Besides he knew he was going to have to come back to Freeport and today was the day.
<br />

<br />
On the other hand the only reason Azia had come was because she heard her son was hurt. It was one of her many instincts she'd gained since becoming a mother. Over time her more violent ways had began to fade, so now the most she would do was give her husband a good smack with a pot when he said or did something wrong.
<br />

<br />
Of course they weren't alone as they entered Freeport. Leona's parents had personally came to see them, especially since the appearance of the demons. Zolf knew that something was up, and with what he heard earlier about Janus going missing after the trip to Faydwer didn't ease his mind any. Pretty much Zinka had the same thoughts as her husband, though she doubted that anything could have seriously happened to the son of someone like Ryo.
<br />

<br />
"So a genuine demon did show up. Somehow I doubt it could be any worse than Azia when she's angry."
<br />

<br />
"Just keep it up Mister.... Don't forget I don't need a pot to bash on you the head with here."
<br />

<br />
"Though both the ones that where in Freeport are dead, I'm still a bit curious as to why they where here."
<br />

<br />
"Don't worry about it Dear. They're gone so our present problems are over with."
<br />

<br />
"Yes I know, I suppose we should be thankful both Zenki and Ryo where here."
<br />

<br />
"Sounds like Ryo had quite some fun here, wonder what he has in mind for finding his son though. It's been awhile since I seen Janus."
<br />

<br />
"Well it wouldn't be awhile if we would at least come here more often!"
<br />

<br />
"Why are you trying to blame this on me?! Your the one who doesn't want to travel!"
<br />

<br />
As to be expected, Azia had came prepared as piece of armor from the pack she was carrying and smacked Shoken with it across the face. This naturally brought a small giggle from Zinka, as well as stifled laugh from Zolf. They could tell they had calmed down for the most part, but even so, Azia didn't let Shoken get away with much more than before.
<br />

<br />
It didn't take them long to make it to where they where going as they entered a house, an where greeted by family and old friends. Those being Iris's parents, as well as Ryo and his wife Rita. It was obvious they where still discussing the situation with Janus by the looks on their faces. Though they where unsure of what Ryo was feeling on this, it was evident the idea of Janus being gone was taking its toll on Rita...
<br />

<br />

<br />
There is a reason this chapter is short, I hate to admit it but I feel it was going to bore everyone. In any case now I'd like to mention something now. I appreciate everyone's support for urging me to write more. I'd also like to say that I will be dedicating the next few chapters to a special person in my life. Marie, thanks for continuing to reach out to me even though I was so filled with hurt, sorrow, and anger. I've said things to you that where not right and know I can't ever repair the damage I've done...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

Chapter 10
<br />

<br />
"The Sea of Tears."
<br />

<br />

<br />
I'm once again trying my best to begin writing. These days it seems I'm running across less and less to write about. Perhaps the well that all this has come from is finally running dry? If so then I'm just going to have to drill down and tap into a greater source.
<br />

<br />

<br />
In Zenki's mind things had went from right from being bad to being what he considered to be a plain out living hell. First he had been dragged onto the Stormbreaker once it had docked at the Freeport Docks, but to top things off so had Leona. An all this had been done by his uncle Ryo, who didn't seemed to trilled about all of this at all either. During all this Nadia had also taken it upon herself to board the ship along with Iris, mostly because of her curiosity about Zenki as well as the possibility of meeting Janus.
<br />

<br />
All during the first few hours of the trip Zenki kept up complaining about being forced to come along. Of course for Ryo this was more of a baby-sitting trip than an actual search, especially with the way Zenki and Leona constantly bickered back and forth. It was taking all he had just to keep from throwing the two of them over board. Truth be known he rather wished they'd fall over by accident then at least they'd have something to do other than fight.
<br />

<br />
"This is all your fault!"
<br />

<br />
"How is this my fault?! Your the one who should be coming on this rather than me, he's your cousin!"
<br />

<br />
"You two need to just shut up..."
<br />

<br />
"An just who are you to think you can boss me around?!"
<br />

<br />
Leona had little chance to say anything else before Ryo heaved her overboard, an to settle the debate he threw Zenki off as well. Thankfully for them the boat had arrived to dock at a  place called Sister Island. Ryo knew better than to try anything here as he quietly stepped off onto the dock along with Nadia and Iris, who by now knew it was best not to trifle with him. Much to their amusement and Ryo's grief both Leona and Zenki where still at it.
<br />

<br />
"Finally someone managed to shut you up."
<br />

<br />
"That's it you little pain!"
<br />

<br />
The next thing everyone saw was a flash of light then Zenki frozen from the waist down. This along was enough to bring a rush of laughter from the passengers stepping off the ship. Still even frozen Zenki couldn't resist making a comment. Of course the next one brought even more laughter than the sight of him frozen.
<br />

<br />
"You've graduated from Fire starter to Leona the frigid Ice Queen of the Ocean."
<br />

<br />
"Oh that's it!"
<br />

<br />
At this point everyone stopped laughing as Leona set about strangling Zenki. This in turn caused Nadia and Iris to rush down into the water and pull her away, kicking and screaming the whole time. Now as everyone knows Sailors can be some of the foulest of men, particularly the ones aboard the Stormbreaker who started to cheer at seeing three young women being trenched and soaked in the cold ocean waters. As could be expected several slur comments where heard as a result.
<br />

<br />
"Take it off baby!"
<br />

<br />
"Yeah give us a real show!"
<br />

<br />
This was all put to an end though as Ryo made his way back to the docks at hearing the words. Those who had hailed from Freeport instantly fled from his path, save for the few who had been stupid enough to remain. All the shout was put to an end once Ryo had grabbed a braggart in each hand an had hung them over the edge of the docks by their shirts. This alone was enough to keep them quiet now.
<br />

<br />
"I suggest you shut up and go about your business on the ship an not trouble the women again. Understood?"
<br />

<br />
"Yes Sir!"
<br />

<br />
"No harm meant on this! Honest!"
<br />

<br />
"Good Now get about your business before I change my mind and turn you into food for the Seafury Cyclops around here!"
<br />

<br />
If it was to be known Ryo wasn't fond of the sea. The was mainly due to the fact that before he had been a result of Xernoss stirring up trouble. Earlier he had taken the time to look down below at the wood beam that Shoken had practiced on it. It still bore the deep scars from the repeated blows that it was dealt, even after it had seen some attention from a repairman. For him those memories where like that of dreams. Certainly he knew what was going on, an sometimes he missed being a part of another person. Of course he had grown quite use to being a sole and complete being, able to do whatever he wished whenever he wished.
<br />

<br />
A short time had passed before everything had settled in. One of the things that Zenki had noticed after he had managed to chip himself out of the ice was that the island was within sight of several other islands. On the top of one he could clearly see some sort of a shrine, and on the other the only thing within sight was the beach itself. Naturally he had taken the time to talk to several people, giving them the description of Janus and asking them if they had seen him. Much to his dismay as no one had anyone even remotely similar.
<br />

<br />
Ryo hadn't had much luck when he had came upon a camp of dwarves. After all he wasn't fond of them in the least. Not that anyone could blame him for all the bar room brawls and street fights he had been involved in because of one noisy drunken dwarf or two with a big mouth. Tonight there would be no such fight as he simply began to search the island for other people. He knew all to well it wouldn't do him any good to get into a fight here, an it surely wouldn't make his questions get answered any quicker. Yet through all this something was nagging at him, making his blood boil as if something or someone he had encountered in the past was nearby.
<br />

<br />
Across the Island Iris had been feeling the exact same thing. Quite often as a child she had been far to attuned to the nature of people and beasts. In some cases it had been a great help, but in others it was a curse. On her many trips to Felwithe she had encountered peoples from other lands, an she could sense that there was something dark and sinister about them. She knew it would do no good to tell the guards though. The one time she had told a guard all he had done was laugh at her then tell her to go off an play else where. She expected no different of this place, yet tonight she would do her best in telling someone who might care.
<br />

<br />
"Nadia? Leona? Do you two sense anything out of place here?"
<br />

<br />
"I'm not quite sure what you mean? Maybe its the sailors?"
<br />

<br />
"The only thing that will be out of place here is Zenki's jaw if he makes another comment like that again."
<br />

<br />
"It's not that, something just feels unnatural here."
<br />

<br />
They really had no idea of just what was going to happen. Iris had been right that something was out of the place. Any of the lookouts who had taken the time to do their duties right would have noticed the masts partially hidden in the mist. They would have also noticed the flags denoting that they belonged to the trolls of the Broken Skull Raiders. It was their business as pirates to use concealment to their advantage just as they had done tonight. This time would be their first of what they planned to be many successive raids on the islands in the Ocean of Tears.
<br />

<br />

<br />
One of the things they hadn't counted on was that there was another ship hidden in the darkness. It was a small vessel, mostly composed of veteran fishermen of various backgrounds. All this was true save for two. One was an aged iksar, and another was a young Shadow Knight from Freeport. Neither had a like for the others company, yet they where closer to each other than to the men on the boat they had boarded. They could have been anyone or anything, their intentions didn't matter with the price they had been paid to take them out to one of the islands.
<br />

<br />
"Lisssten young one... I've only agreed to thisss because you paid half the fare."
<br />

<br />
"That's fine by me since we both missed the ship at the docks."
<br />

<br />
The only reason the iksar had came was not because he was traveling back to Kunark. Instead his interests lay in the knowledge that his long time friend had left Freeport. A little probing at several darker area's of the social community had given rise to answer to that. If in fact his son was gone then he would most certainly lend his hand in helping track the youngest down. This was far better than just traveling back to Kunark an having nothing to do but train the younger iksar in the arts of combat.
<br />

<br />
Monozard still had something on his mind during all this time he had spent on this fishing boat. He wondered why this youngster was heading out into the Ocean of Tears like this. The only answer he had gotten to his questions earlier was that he should mind his own business. It was odd for him though to see this. Given that he was in all appearance outfitted in the armor of an Apprentice Shadow Knight and didn't appear to hold himself like a well skilled swordsman this was far to dangerous a journey, especially if he was indeed going alone.
<br />

<br />
"If you must know something about me, the name is Aurius. Now please stop staring at me."
<br />

<br />
"Your a ssstrange one, malevolence is a trait of all ssshadow knightsss. It appearsss you have nothing of the sssort yet."
<br />

<br />
"And what would you know about Shadow Knights old iksar?"
<br />

<br />
"I know plenty. From birth we iksarsss are taught to ssspread terror and malevolence through the world."
<br />

<br />
"If you must know, until I see more of the world I can't make the choice that my path will take. I'm after a man who's caused a lot of grief and suffering. He is said to be part of a band of pirates. Where better to find that sort of man then the sea right?"
<br />

<br />
"I sssee your point. Ssso your after what I take is revenge, not out to caussse more of the dessstruction that thisss man hasss causssed?"
<br />

<br />
"Yes, and the only way I could get the information I wanted was by joining and studying at the Shadow Knight guild in Freeport."
<br />

<br />
Aurius now took the time to study his traveling companion for this boat ride. Aside from the cloak the best thing he could find to describe what this iksar studied where the hand and leg wraps. These where a clear indication that what he was traveling with was an aged and battle hardened monk. With closer examination he could see the way he held himself was like that of several monks he had see in Freeport. This further more raised his suspicions about why this iksar was here, heading into an area where most of his kind where hated so easily.
<br />

<br />
"To sssolve your curiosssity young one, I have come here to aid an old friend."
<br />

<br />
"Well then it appears that we both have clear intentions out here."
<br />

<br />
"Be warned young one. I sssense a great evil coming to thisss place."
<br />

<br />
Before the aged eyes of the iksar, and the young enthusiastic eyes of his companion the mast of a great ship came into view. It was far enough out of it's foggy confines now to be clearly seen by anyone searching for it. This had been the evil that Monozard talked about as closer inspection brought a sickening revelation to the iksars mind. He knew all to well where this mixed crew came from now. Many years had passed since he has crossed the likes of the Broken Skull's pirates, and here they where sneaking up through the darkness to attack an island.
<br />

<br />
Aurius was astonished at the size of the ship before him. It was at least twice as large as the other ships he had seen at the docks in Freeport. Also he now knew that the rumors and stories of the Broken Skull pirates where true in their fullest. None of the ships inhabitants that he could see where what he could consider to be easy prey for any of his most basic training. The man he looked for would surely be known to this rough and course lot before his eyes. He was now going to get revenge for the pain that was caused all those years ago.
<br />

<br />

<br />
The pirates where use to stealth as they made their way from their ship and into the darkened waters. As typical they instantly spread out, making their way through the darkness exactly as true creatures of the night would. The sentries posted at the furthest edge of the island made no sound as they where each systematically killed. Their vain attempts to scream warnings where halted as grotesque green hands where clamped over their mouths, and then a cutlass shoved through their backs only to exit out their gullets.
<br />

<br />
Unlike most trolls, the Broken Skull had allowed in many other races. It was usual practice for the trolls to first destroy the first few defenses of a ship or an island. That way the less resilient of their forces would have little trouble reaching the goal. Their tactics where to take control in numbers rather than use total brute strength. This way the more that survived till the end of a raid, the more they would have to pick out and be sold as slaves.
<br />

<br />
Tonight was going to be far different for them though. Ryo had sensed the evil approaching the island and had already taken up observation high in the top of one of the few tree's that graced the island. He waited and watched as their vile creatures came out of the waters, and as they began to take prisoners below. In his mind he knew that Leona, Nadia, and Iris would be fair prey for them to take as slaves. The only wild card in this deck of players would be Zenki. He basically had no idea of how he could or would react to all these events.
<br />

<br />
Soon Ryo's eyes spied at small vessel approach the island and then what he could tell was an iksar and a human step foot on the beach. This brought a twisted smile to his face as he realized just who had came. It had been so long since has seen this person, and it was quite surprising to see him here now. The other was a complete mystery to him though, but his armor was that of an apprentice shadow knight, this much he knew.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Just as anyone predicted Leona had not taken lightly to seeing a troll, and the chaos that ensued was worse than the incident in Freeport. All manner of obscenities and insults had spewed from her mouth as the pirates stopped to gawk at her. They had managed to sneak up on the three women, but blew their chance as a total surprise when they paused to ogle them. The last thing they would expect was an infuriated sorceress.
<br />

<br />
"Meza thik girls make good slaves."
<br />

<br />
"You know dear boy, I think your right. The Captain would like these lassies."
<br />

<br />
"Slave?! Dirty Bastards!"
<br />

<br />
"Fiesty too! Meza liks!!"
<br />

<br />
As to be predicted the next thing that happened was the two unfortunate pirates ended up being incinerated before their cohorts. The resulting explosions and flashes of light could be seen all over the island. Pirates flew this way and that as the ground under them burst open, sending them hurling into the air. Finally after several managed to get in close her hands where shoved behind her back, then tied. Of course during all this Nadia and Iris where of little help, neither where very good at any kind of fight as they where soon tied up like Leona and shoved along towards the docks. All the way Leona constantly screamed, loud enough for the rest of the prisoners to hear from quite a distance away.
<br />

<br />
Zenki on the other hand had been doing his best to avoid the few pirates that had found him. They had never seen anyone who could dodge or move as fast as he was. Whether it was daggers, swords, or shurikens they just couldn't hit him. That all held true till he turned to run and ran face first into what looked like the biggest troll he had ever seen. It was at least three times the size of the others and had this stupid looking grin on its face.
<br />

<br />
"Uh hi there fella... Your going to hit me now right?"
<br />

<br />
"Trog SMASH!!!"
<br />

<br />
The troll promptly slapped a surprised Zenki to the ground with both hands. It was lights out for him as he lay there, the ground clearly cracked under the impact of the his body being forced down so hard. It had been child's play for the Trog to do this, though he had to admit his hands did smart from hitting the young human so hard. The massive troll gave a slight grunt then tossed Zenki over his shoulders and headed towards the docks with his compatriots.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Ryo had heard all the commotion and felt the ground rumble as he made his way to the beach silently. He knew that Monozard would surely sense him as he came up from behind. The Shadow knight on the other hand he was certain would be surprised. This all suited Ryo fine, after all he wasn't one to be completely innocent when it came to scaring people. At times he rather loved doing it to the monks in Freeport. It taught them to be well on their toes.
<br />

<br />
"So what brings you so far out here on the ocean Monozard?"
<br />

<br />
"I came to help you search for your son of course. I would think you would enjoy some sort of civil company."
<br />

<br />
"Where did you come from?!"
<br />

<br />
Aurius was completely puzzled at this feat, as it was something he knew only rogues where capable of. Clearly this man was not a rogue though, from the clothes he wore and the way he held himself. He simply couldn't grasp what he was, since he held himself similar to Monozard, but something was different. It was as if he was in a constant state of shifting, as if he seemed to be everything and nothing at the same time if that was even possible.
<br />

<br />
"I walked up rather slowly, that's where I came from."
<br />

<br />
"Auriusss thisss man here is known asss Ryo, and expect to sssee other such thingsss if you intend to ssstay on this island much longer."
<br />

<br />
"Ryo, as in the same Ryo that trains with the monks in Freeport?"
<br />

<br />
"I am the very same. And from what I can sense is that everyone is gathered at the docks, save for us."
<br />

<br />
"You do realize thessse are the Broken Skull piratesss right? That means Zane will be here for sssure."
<br />

<br />
"Mono I might be getting older, but I'm neither stupid nor blind now and never intend to be."
<br />

<br />
That name had been one that Aurius had long since hated. It was the man he was searching for, and it was the person he was out here for now. This man had managed to slaughter his family save for him, and over the years he had searched and found out who was responsible for the raid that was done on his fathers ship. The shadow knights in Freeport had sensed this hatred, and being followers of Innoruuk realized it was something that could be twisted and used as a perverse power. It had the quality that all of their Knights strive to attain, and now it was coursing through his veins with renewed passion.
<br />

<br />
"Ssso ssshould we just walk in and lay waste to them like we did in the Crow's Pub back in Qeynosss? Or ssshould we take a calmer approach."
<br />

<br />
"It would appear as your young friend has other plans."
<br />

<br />
Both Ryo and Monozard shook their heads as they watched Aurius head towards the docks. That had most certainly settled their dispute over how they should go about saving the people as they quickly fell in step behind the young man. There was something the two of them felt within him now. It was similar in feeling to their own nature, but more intense and fueled by what they knew was the rage of youth.
<br />

<br />
As was usual the pirate captain Zane always expected the unexpected. This was the reason he wasn't surprised that someone made it past his underlings. There was a deft flick of his wrist as his cutlass was unsheathed and pointed at the three people he seen come into view before him. One he knew by sight from several years before at a tournament, the iksar he only knew by rumors at best from Qeynos. Of all the people before him the young man garbed in shoddy armor posed more of a mystery, and hence more of a threat than anyone else.
<br />

<br />
"Listen Fella's I know your not the brightest candles of the lot, but do be more careful so as we don't have anymore guests like those."
<br />

<br />
While he wasn't whole out pleased with this situation as it was now there was nothing he could do. After all who could expect much from a shipload of a mixed bunch, mostly composed of trolls. The best of his warriors was Trog, who doing just as he was told was tying up their captives as he spoke. Zane had given him explicit orders to tie the redheaded fellow they found to the mast, and shackle the crimson haired lass with what he called a fiery temper to its opposite side.
<br />

<br />
"Zane you've got a lot of nerve coming out to this part of the world. You know well and good coming out here would mean you'd run into me."
<br />

<br />
"Aye I did know I'd see you, as such can be expected since your child is gone is he not?"
<br />

<br />
"What do you know about the young Janusss?"
<br />

<br />
"For that dear lizard you'll have to get through my men. While not the most astute bunch, they do get the job done when it comes to bashing a skull in."
<br />

<br />
There was a nod given between the aged iksar and his old ally. Just as they had done in the Crow's Pub the two leapt back away from each other just as a troll on either side of them struck out. With as much grace and synchronization as two dancers they landed a fierce blow to their advisari. The result was the two trolls collided face to face demonstrating just how clumsy and offish they could be. Not wanting to be left out of the fight Aurius drew his blackened sword from its shield and lashed out at what he could tell was the weakest enemy near him.
<br />

<br />
A trail of blood sprayed into the air as a dagger grazed Ryo's shoulder while he was dispatching another foe, this one being a human. Having seen this Monozard had taken a step back from the battle, a deep reptilian chuckle coming from his throat as he knew to well what was going to happen. Long ago he had witnessed what had happened to those who managed to anger Ryo and this was going to be no exception.
<br />

<br />
"I hope you've written your willsss. He will not let you live now."
<br />

<br />
"You'll all perish now... Fools!!!"
<br />

<br />
The air filled with what could be described the howling of pain and hate itself. Ryo would give them no amount of salvation from his wrath. Normally he repressed such feelings, for the sake of his family and the few he called friends. These where neither though as his eyes narrowed shifted to a ghostly obsidian color at the pirates surrounding him. The first to rush him was to meet a horrible fate as Ryo wrapped his fingers around the idiots arms and jerked upwards. Bone fragments and blood filled the air as the pirates seen the true nature and ferocity of the man before them.
<br />

<br />
One after another Aurius watched in astonishment as he watched what he thought was a demon start its assault on their foes. Clearly he could see this man or beast before him cared not for the pain he caused as limbs where torn from bodies, raising showers of crimson liquid into the air. Before long there was not a raider that dared attack the blood drenched Ryo, for fear they would certainly die like their comrades. During all this Monozard watched with what most would call an interest, never having had the chance to witness his old friend in such a frenzied state before.
<br />

<br />
The aged pirate leader would have no more of this though and with a snap of his fingers Trog pulled out a cutlass and aimed it at the fierce tempered redheaded beauty shackled to the mast. Zane was not one to lose so easily, and certainly didn't intend to how. He had heard stories of this man before him, and now knew the truth. Also he was willing to bet he had a weakness for the helpless.
<br />

<br />
"Trog be a good boy an if our dear supposed Demon of Freeport there so much as moves kill the girl as you wish."
<br />

<br />
"Trog not get to use girlie?"
<br />

<br />
"That all depends upon him down there."
<br />

<br />
"Bastard, I'd not bet everything on a single person. You have little knowledge about what is aboard that ship."
<br />

<br />
Leona could do nothing but shiver in rage and horror as the massive trolls hand came to wrap around her throat. Tears filled her eyes as it's foul breath filled her nostrils, and its cutlass caressed her cheek. She dare not move now for fear of being choked to death or gutted right before everyone. It was then that her eyes focused in on the terrified looks of Nadia and Iris who had not yet been moved onto the ship. Then her eyes moved on to Aurius and Ryo who stood perfectly still as Monozard swished his reptilian tail back and forth in irritation.
<br />

<br />
Little did anyone suspect what was happening in the sleeping mind of Zenki. The darkness spoke to him in sensual tones. It acted as if it wanted to take him, and devour his very being. In the darkness there felt as if there was someone or something. It was alluring and enticing, pulling at his very soul. All he could do was wonder what to do, whether to follow this voice in the darkness, or stay where he was and wait for something else to happen.
<br />

<br />
"Come to me young Zenki... Forget everything and come be at peace..."
<br />

<br />
"That sounds perfect. Forget everything and just resting sounds so very nice."
<br />

<br />
"Yes come to me... Come be at peace, forget the women and your family."
<br />

<br />
Those last few words he had heard finally trigged his minds eye. Opening it to the dim reality that surrounded him. In the distance he could see Iris and Nadia, with terrible and frightened looks on their face. He could see his uncle Ryo, obviously frustrated and angered beyond anything he had ever seen before. The other two people he could not clearly make out, but they to appeared to be infuriated just as his uncle was. It was then that he had come to his decision, which would be something none would expect.
<br />

<br />
"I'll not leave them, and I'll not leave Leona!"
<br />

<br />
This was when Leona felt as if her life was going to end. The hair on her neck stood on end as she felt something incredibly strong and savage near here. She began to cringe and finally broken into sobs, since there was nothing she could do to prevent anything. The tears where there because no matter how the events played out she couldn't see anything that would bring her out of this situation. Finally she could hear the wood of the mast beginning to crack, she realized who was just on the other side of the wood now.
<br />

<br />
This was when Zane turned to see the young man he had Trog die to the mast, and now he see the wood and chain beginning to strain under the raw strength he now possessed. Zenki let out the most blood chilling scream anyone, save for Ryo, had heard before. The chains finally tore apart at the seams, much to the surprise of Trog. It was a definite challenge or so the beast thought as it pulled its attention away from Leona and stood before his new foe.
<br />

<br />
"Trog SMASH!!!"
<br />

<br />
"No, Zenki Smash!!!"
<br />

<br />
Trog soon found out what a real smash was as Zenki leapt up and drove a knee firmly into the trolls face, mangling it beyond all recognition. There was little time for Trog to recuperate though as he soon found himself being swung by his own massive arms into the mast of the ship. Zane having been a bright man took this chance to move down from the ship, capturing Nadia in one swift motion and bringing a dagger to her throat. The mistake was his attention was still on Ryo, and not on the actions taking place on the ship.
<br />

<br />
"You move Demon and I slit her throat."
<br />

<br />
Zenki dealt the final blow to the massive Trog, and that is when his attention turned fully onto the instigator of all this. There was nothing but contempt and hatred for this man in Zenki's eyes now. Then he seen an unfamiliar figure come up behind him, waiting for the chance to pounce and take the old pirate by surprise. A smile came to Zenki's face as he grasped a piece of the chains that bound him, then threw them down into Zane's face to give his apparent friend below the chance to move.
<br />

<br />
Indeed it had been Aurius chance to move and he did so by shoving Nadia out of the way. Hand grasped hand as the young shadow knight found himself the target of the dagger that would surely pierce his weak armor and take his life. He wanted revenge on this man though, and he wanted him to pain. Aurius wanted this man to feel the same suffering he had endured all his life. The hatred and raged fueled his flesh and made his body burn, bringing forth a pain that Zane had never felt before from the hands that where now intertwined with his. There was a burst of force and then the elder man found himself reeling backwards.
<br />

<br />
"That was for myself! This is for my family! Die!"
<br />

<br />
Aurius found an unrealized speed he had never attained before as his sword was charged by his newfound power. There was a flash of dark light as it cleaved into the chest of his most hated enemy, searing his flesh. The finale was an upper ward jerk of the blade that nearly slip Zane into two before he burst into what could be called the flames from hell itself. It was over at last as he turned away from the burning corpse and looked on at the people before him.
<br />

<br />
All Ryo could do was nod, then look over at Zenki. There would be a lot of explaining to be done about what the two of them had done. Also now there was the matter that things where not as they appeared. Whatever was happening in the world was not something as simple as someone disappearing. There where forces at work that would have to be dealt with soon...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>
