Chapter 1

<br />
"On the Run!"
<br />

<br />

<br />
It is now that I'd like to say I miss my friends that have quit EQ. Estak, if you ever read this I think you should consider coming back, it's just not the same without you. Goranothos, I hope things are going well with you. I hope some day I'll see you all once again on EQ...
<br />

<br />
Many years have passed since the second fall of Xernoss. The world itself has been thrust into an oncoming turmoil, much to the thanks of the Spirit Masters having been imprisoned. They where feared for their great power could rival even the most powerful of gods. Having seen this they have been thrust into an alter plane by orders from both Qeynos and Neriak. Their powers have been sealed away via the use of the Dragon's Crest, the very same spell that holds Kerafyrm at bay in a deep slumber. Only two have escaped the punishment forced upon those who carried the power of the Spirit Master. Now the time has come for the last of the bloodline to awaken his abilities that have been hidden for his own protection. It is now time for the great power to be unsealed so that it might once again protect the world...
<br />

<br />
The world has become bleak and spirals towards hopelessness, due to circumstances involving the being known as the Dread King the entire Faydwer continent is unlivable. Though through this great things have happened. The Freeport Militia and the Knights of Truth have came to the understanding that if they don't work together then the Dread King could very well invade their city, and neither wants such to happen.
<br />

<br />
Qeynos suffered perhaps the greatest of changes since the fall of Erudin. Since the founding of Palsa things have had a profound effect, particularly since travel has been enhanced via the use of air ships. High Pass Hold has thus become a port town much like Qeynos and Freeport once where due to its high vantage point. However, ever since the Dread King came into power on Faydwer the undead in Kithicor have fallen to it's whims. Travel on the ground now through that forsaken forest is near impossible, save for the few who consider it to be a home, these people are ranked among some of the more unique individuals.
<br />

<br />
Corruption still laces the Governmental systems, as now they have had to dissuade the publics knowledge of just what occurs on Faydwer. More importantly they've blinded the public to the fact that several people still live in Kithicor. It is in the darkness which has been overrun with undead that the last remaining Spirit Master has been forced to travel through to conceal his identity. The reason for is a new branch of research has been in effect for several years, this is called science, and the users of such methods, the scientists, wish to find out the source of the Spirit Masters great powers.
<br />

<br />
Through the years Cain, as well as Zebuxoruk have managed to keep Magus's child from being captured. Yes, the old man has been crafty, living a life that's constantly on the go. Of course the ungod has always kept in touch with them, warning them of when a search team would be heading there way. This is the life that has been forced upon these individuals, their hopes have rested in the fact that if this young man could become old enough he could free his family.
<br />

<br />
Cain's ultimate goal is now revenge, he wants nothing more than to see his family again. In truth he would like nothing more than to destroy those who have hunted him and this child who reminds him so much of his own son. Age has been against him and the passage of time has been taking its toll. The old sorcerers powers have gradually been fading, which he has been trying to conceal.
<br />

<br />
- Cain, listen up, there's a research team heading your way. -
<br />

<br />
-Well Zeb that's nothing really new now is it?-
<br />

<br />
-This time isn't like the others, they're serious now.-
<br />

<br />
-Start explaining then Zeb, though I doubt it's anything disastrous.-
<br />

<br />
-They found some of your old journals mentioning the Exodus, and Cyrus. You where saying?-
<br />

<br />
-Well it's not the first time I've been wrong.-
<br />

<br />
-There was also that time with the hooker who turned out to be...-, the ungod found himself cut off before another thought could be sent, he knew Cain was touchy on that subject.
<br />

<br />
-Now you list up good, anyone could of made that mistake! Now how close is the retrieval team?-
<br />

<br />
-I'd give them about 15 minutes tops before they're in Freeport and beating down the door to your room.-
<br />

<br />
-Cutting it close aren't we?-, at that the old man was on the move down stairs to the bar area.
<br />

<br />
-I'll get back to you on that, just get out of there!-
<br />

<br />
Cain didn't have to be told twice, though he knew someone else would be. It wasn't going to be easy for him to find his great great grandson in all this mess. Luck was on his side as he heard him shouting. He could never understand this youngster, and how he could handle so much food and still not gain any weight.
<br />

<br />
"Waitress I'll have another 3 plates!"
<br />

<br />
"Boy you've had enough, its time we go going!", instantly Cain grabbed the young man and started to drag him from the table.
<br />

<br />
"Let go you dirty ol' man! Why do you always have to do this while I'm eating?!!!", all he could do was grab a drumstick from the waitress who was bringing him his food.
<br />

<br />
"Here sweetie, see ya around!", as usual the old man tossed the waitress a hefty bag full of platinum as he disappeared up the stairs with the young man.
<br />

<br />
Indeed this time everything was being cut close, of course the both of them being slobs didn't help much either. It wasn't so much the cloths on the floor that where giving them problems, rather it was underwear hanging off the bedposts. This combine with their weapons being scattered all over the room didn't help much either.
<br />

<br />
Cain could hear armor clad footsteps nearing the tavern, it was unmistakable now. Over the years his hearing had become attuned to the sound that armor made when it moved, thus he could distinctly make out which metal was used in the armor. This had paid off for him more than once, and today it once again did so. He could clearly hear the telltale sound of government issued armor as it made its way down the street.
<br />

<br />

<br />
This was a despicable job for her to perform, of all things it had to be this. She never did like the idea of sending out search teams for individuals, generally it was the typical renegade who had stolen something from one of the governments. After reading the documents over this mission she was more than curious as to what such an old man, and a young man could have done to have her unit sent after them. Most of the time she could care less about what she had to do, as long as she was paid for it.
<br />

<br />
It was obvious that whatever these two done, that they had certainly made a big fuss. After all it wasn't often her unit was sent out, mainly because of their higher rate of pay and demands on equipment. They where the best of the best though, and that brought with it a high price, namely access to nearly all the technology the governments had been holding back. They got everything from advanced weapons to communications equipment. The only conditions they had to follow where to keep the use of such items from public view.
<br />

<br />
This tended to work out well since most of their targets where hiding in some deserted area of the world. If anything this suited them just fine, since they never had to worry about how much destruction they caused. Most of the time concealment wasn't even needed, save for this instance of course. Truth be known, the development and research teams practically crammed the weapons into their hands half the time.
<br />

<br />
Now this time was going to be hard, since they had been only given a rough estimate of their foes abilities. The elder man known as Cain was reported to be a powerful sorcerer, though they where confident this latest form of armor they had received could handle anything he sent at them. The other person was a true mystery though, no name, only an estimated age was given. There wasn't even an MTA listing on this person, which clearly made things more aggrivating.
<br />

<br />
This just gave them all the chance to test out the latest MTA reader they had been issued. It was compact unit, integrated right in with their ear pieces. The only difference this time was the fact that it had a small crystal eyepiece that covered one eye. Along with this was a prototype pulse rifle that mimiced most of the bolt type spells that Mage's use to use.
<br />

<br />
"Commander Kei, the ones we're searching for are said to be in this tavern."
<br />

<br />
"Let's get this over with then."
<br />

<br />
Most certainly Kei was never one to be seen sitting still. As a child she always had to be busy, and that only made her physically abilities come out even more. Then again her raw strength had gotten her into a fair share of trouble too. It wasn't her fault though, what with her being an eighth kerran. This being known she had received her fair share of attention as she got older, and generally she put her strength to good use by sending the poor unfortunate young men who harassed her to the hospital.
<br />

<br />
Through the years her instincts had proven quite amazing and she could easily predict just what the people she tracked down would do. Which is why she sent her fellow team mates in first, to flush out the prey. This was a tried an true method, and generally always worked to lure people out of public places so they could use their more advanced weapons to finish them off. Little could she have expected what might happen though.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Cain heard the footsteps coming up the stairs and knew from the rhythm of the steps, and the sound they made that they where definitely trained soldiers. He knew getting past them was going to be near impossible especially since he hadn't found the time to teach the youngster anything new as of late. He had slacked off on training, mostly because it had been well over a month since they eluded the last retrieval team.
<br />

<br />
"Listen up, we're gonna have to go out the window."
<br />

<br />
"Why the hell should we when we can just walk down the stairs?!"
<br />

<br />
"Just shut up and get going!", with that Cain threw their bags out the window, then tossed the youngster out.
<br />

<br />
Normally this would have worked, if it wouldn't have been for the fact that the bag's nearly landed on Kei's head. The next surprise was when a young man landed on her, knocking her onto her back with him practically laying ontop of her. Fate seems to have a way of making it's way felt in certain situations, and this one was definitely going to take that account literally.
<br />

<br />
With all this happening the young man was dazed, and more so was confused as to just what he landed on. One of his major flaws was that he was damn near gutless, and so had closed his eyes the moment he was sent sailing out the window. The fact that he had landed on something soft had definitely gotten his attention though, and just as any blind person he would, he took it upon himself to feel around just what he had landed on.
<br />

<br />
"What the hell do you think your grabbing?!"
<br />

<br />
"Hi, Wait a sec its not what you...", he had made the mistake of placing his hands in the wrong place, and in turn received a good slap across the face for it.
<br />

<br />
"Watch out below Hibiki!!!"
<br />

<br />
Cain took it upon himself to then jump out the window, though his landing was much more graceful as he landed next to the young man an the woman. He recognized her all to well, in fact he had seen some of her handy work from before. The fact that Hibiki was apparently feeling her up wasn't going to make things easier on them either.
<br />

<br />
"Hibiki, quit your gropin and lets get going before she really gets pissed!"
<br />

<br />
"It's not what you think Grandpa Cain honest!"
<br />

<br />
"Just shut up an run! Your little play thing there is Command Kei!"
<br />

<br />
Before she could make a move the two of them had gathered their things and took off running. At least now she knew what her targets looked like, of course to her surprise her subordinates had seen the entire scene. They viewed her as a cold ice queen of a woman, and seeing her blush like she was just now only brought about tear jerking laughter.
<br />

<br />
"What the hell are you all laughing about?! Your letting our targets get away!"
<br />

<br />
This was enough to bring them back to their senses, and back to the mission at hand. Though to be honest Kei was probably more astounded at what happened than what her fellow teammates where. She had more than enough time to memorize both their faces, and so finding them wasn't going to be so difficult now. 
<br />

<br />
In the meantime Cain and Hibiki where both in a heated argument as they ran down the streets of Freeport. Neither had any idea of what to do now, this had been the closest any team had gotten to them, and Cain was certain it was going to be hard to shake them. The fact that Kei was after them now meant things where worse off than he had realized.
<br />

<br />
"God damn it boy, I know she's nice looking an all but she's a real killer!"
<br />

<br />
"It wasn't what it looked like! Besides you threw me out onto her!"
<br />

<br />
"Well if you had only kept your eyes open then you wouldn't have landed on her! Big Chicken!"
<br />

<br />
"Look who's talking you mana saturated midget from hell!"
<br />

<br />
"If we get out of this I'm gonna kick your ass for that one."
<br />

<br />
"What do you mean 'If', and just why the hell do we have to always stay on the run?!", Hibiki now knew from the looks of things that the old man had been lying to him.
<br />

<br />
"All right I'll tell you what I can now, your special okay, they want to use you for a guinea pig in experiments."
<br />

<br />
"What about what you've told me about my parents dying? Is that a lie to?!"
<br />

<br />
"They ain't dead, the people that pay that woman back there had them sealed away! Now enough with the questions!"
<br />

<br />
Cain came to the grim realization that if Kei and her unit where after them that chances of a clean escape where going to be limited at best. The underground tunnels in Freeport where of absolutely no use in this situation, that much was certain. It was certain they could scan them quicker than they could find a hiding place. He knew full well they needed some place that couldn't be traveled well by anyone, including themselves.
<br />

<br />
"Hey Hibiki, you got any idea of a place that we'd even have a problem following us in?"
<br />

<br />
"That makes absolutely no sense at all!"
<br />

<br />
"Think, boy, think! What place around here would give even us trouble and provide us with a good hiding place?"
<br />

<br />
"That would have to be Kithicor, it's over run with the nastiest undead this side of Faydwer."
<br />

<br />
"Then that's where we're gonna go!"
<br />

<br />
No sooner had they come to this decision than none other that Kei had caught up with them. She wasn't about to be made a fool of by these people, after all she had a reputation to uphold. If anything Kei was determined to get this mission over and get her pay, as well as find out just why two ordinary people where so important to find.
<br />

<br />
"Hey Hibiki, I got an idea, but you have to take care of lover girl there for a moment while I get ready."
<br />

<br />
"We'll at least I can actually find the real women!"
<br />

<br />
"Oh that's it boy, your toast when this is all done! Just keep them all busy!", with that Cain shoved Hibiki towards their pursuers.
<br />

<br />
Cain definitely had a plan, he knew that there was a teleportation pad just near the entrance to Kithicor. What with all the use of airships hardly anyone took the time to travel on foot or by the use of those pads anymore. It was their best chance at escaping, if only he had the time to complete the spell. This is where Hibiki was desparately needed, because if he could keep them busy long enough they'd both get away and the unit would be left with egg on their faces.
<br />

<br />
"Um hey about before, it's not my fault honest! Grandpa, just how am I suppose to keep them busy?!", as usual, Hibiki felt like he was way in over his head.
<br />

<br />
"Just shut up, fight or at least try to get there attention you wimp!"
<br />

<br />
This was far more odd for Hibiki than anything else, he'd never really fought anyone before. The closest he had ever come to a fight was when Cain taught him basic hand to hand techniques. He knew how to dodge well enough, and he damn well knew he could out run them. Since running wasn't an option now he had to make due with whatever he could.
<br />

<br />
"Let me handle him guys, I owe him a beating for grabbing me."
<br />

<br />
Kei had just had about enough of dealing with all of this, she was ready to pulverize something. The orders she was given didn't take into account that he had to be returned in perfect shape, which meant she could have a little fun with him now. For as cruel as she could of been she always preferred a fair fight, even now this took precedence as she discarded he sword.
<br />

<br />
She was just going to make this short and simple as she moved forward with the cat like reflexes all Kerran's have been known for. Much to her surprise she found that Hibiki was able to avoid her attack. She simply couldn't understand what was going on now, she had about the fastest reflexes of anyone in any unit. It became apparent to her that just punches weren't going to work against him.
<br />

<br />
"So you want to be a show off huh? Fine, then I'll give you a show."
<br />

<br />
"Uh Grandpa hurry it up!!! She's getting mad!"
<br />

<br />
Before Hibiki could move he found his feet being swept from under him. It wasn't so much the downward trip to the ground that hurt, it was downward punch from Kei that literally bounced him off the hardened stone street. He had never really been good at fighting, and this kind of speed was just out of his league, the first time had just been luck.
<br />

<br />
"Hibiki! Stop fooling around and fight!"
<br />

<br />
"Damn it old man I am!"
<br />

<br />
"Well try harder!!!"
<br />

<br />
Once again Kei was on the offensive as she jerked Hibiki to his feet and forcefully shoved him face first into the wall of a nearby building. She was far from done with him though as her fingers interwined with his hair as she drove his face into the wall again. After that all Hibiki could see was stars. He wasn't use to be hit this hard, even when training with Cain he hadn't been treated so roughly.
<br />

<br />
"An to think, the reports listed this guy as being extremely dangerous."
<br />

<br />
"Maybe to a baby but he's no match for our Kei here now is he?"
<br />

<br />
"His parents must be ashamed of him! I would be if I had a kid this pathetic."
<br />

<br />
"Hey Kei, can we check the reader and see just what this little punk's MTA is at?"
<br />

<br />
"Go right ahead, no one is looking..."
<br />

<br />
She was really enjoying herself now as she rammed Hibiki's head back into the wall. This time when his head was pulled back blood could be seen coming from a gash on his forehead. She was now curious as to just what his MTA could be, after all everyone had at least a rating between one to five. Anything higher indicated they had done some sort of mana manipulation training. What was about to happen shocked her, since she had never before heard one of her teammates so rattled.
<br />

<br />
"Kei, somethings not right! This thing's busted or something!"
<br />

<br />
"Just shut up and tell me the reading!"
<br />

<br />
"I'm getting nothing on the wimp."
<br />

<br />
"That's impossible, he has to be at least one."
<br />

<br />
"I'm getting zero, it's like he's dead or something."
<br />

<br />
Hibiki was unconscious as he was being held there by Kei, even in the darkness of his mind he felt weak. He never was one to be much of a fighter and this much proved that, yet there was a nagging feeling. Something was urging him to fight, as if something inside him was reacting to all the violence around him. It was if one part of him was reveling in the violence, while another part despised it and wanted nothing to do with it.
<br />

<br />
Long forgotten visons of his infancy began to flood his mind, images of his parents. He could see his mother clearly, her brown locks of hair and amber colored eyes. Then there was his father, the off-white hair and deep brown eyes. They where the same color as his eyes, though they seemed different. In the same place he could sense other people, people that seemed to give off the same feelings as his parents.
<br />

<br />
Soon everything changed, now he was being held by his mother and two men where fighting in front of them. They both appeared to be alike, yet some how different, one had a malevolent temperment. The other was near the exact opposite, as the battle continued they where evenly matched. It was clear they both had trained in the same style of combat, and had done this many times before.
<br />

<br />
Everything was cut short as Hibiki once again began to regain conciousness, instantly he felt the pain from his head. He could clearly see the wall before him stained with blood, his own blood. At seeing this something was beginning to eat away at him, he wanted to do something but wasn't sure what. It was then that he felt Kei shake him as if she where about to do something else to him.
<br />

<br />
"Hibiki, damn it wake up! If you don't then you'll end up like your parents!"
<br />

<br />
"My..... Par.......ents....", it was impossible for him to say much else as his senses where still fuzzy.
<br />

<br />
"I think it's safe to save this mission is ov.....", Kei was interrupted once again, this time by an elbow that was being lodged into her stomach.
<br />

<br />
If there had been one thing he could remember from being unconscious, it was a few of the moves he had seen the two people fighting perform. He knew he could at least try to mimic them, if anything it was worth a shot since everything else he had tried hadn't worked. Now he had Kei where he wanted her as he span around and flung her over his shoulder. This in turn drove her to the ground, knocking the rest of the wind out of her.
<br />

<br />
"Here we go Hibiki! Hang onto your underwear!"
<br />

<br />
Cain had managed to finish casting his spell, and in a flash of light they where gone. This only proved to damage Kei's ego that much more. She couldn't believe she had let her guard down, or that he was able to topple her. Now she knew for certain something was up, and she wanted to know more about what ever Hibiki was. To find out she was going to track him down at any cost, even if it meant her own life...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

Chapter 2
<br />

<br />
"Assault of the Undead, Past Revealed"
<br />

<br />

<br />
This place was nothing short of a pure nightmare for Kei's unit. Kithicor had to be one of the most disturbing places in the world, second only to that of Faydwer. The tree themselves appeared to be the only thing that had a shred of life in it. Now she truly had found a place she was weary of enter. If anything she felt that the massive gates that sealed up the paths and passages into the great forest just simply weren't enough.
<br />

<br />
What Kei knew from simple memory was that just after the being known as the Dread King managed to conquer Faydwer, that Kithicor itself had been sealed. This wasn't an easy task by far and the fact that only the most supreme of priests where capable of creating the gates that now stood behind her was simply mind boggling. These gates, termed "Ward Gates", where in fact stone enchanted to keep the Undead that permeated the forest from spreading out into the world.
<br />

<br />
Only those who had an extreme curiosity of the dead, or where in fact insane would dare enter this forest now. Those few scientists who now traveled into the forest where often guarded by at least four units, and even then causalities where high. The ones that made it out where often to traumatized to go back to normal life, or held such great contempt for this place that they came back to avenge their fallen friends.
<br />

<br />
Over the course of the years, even the scientists had given up on searching this place but once a year. In that amount of time they had discovered several new types of undead creatures, but the information was classified. Few people even heard of the creatures, and more often then not unit's such as Kei's where only given basic information on which to be careful of. 
<br />

<br />
This all didn't deter her from the mission at hand though, it just meant that her unit was going to receive a higher rating, and thus more pay. In the back of her mind though something was telling her that this incursion into the forest was going to prove more dangerous than normal. Surely she knew by now that her prey had came here for some reason. It was this fact that kept her constantly checking over her shoulder for the slightest indication of an attack.
<br />

<br />
When they had entered the forest they had taken the time to put on all the equipment they had been given. This was a very secluded and private place after all, which mean they could practically set off all their grenades in one go and not have to worry about drawing attention. The other thing that was interesting was these new rifles had been given a special setting for undead. Though the researchers had told them it never was fully tested on anything remotely powerful, it had been effective enough to stop the average undead cyclops in one shot.
<br />

<br />
Kei was very surprised though at how light the armor she had been given was. It was far lighter than what she could have expected. What she had been told the new armor was a new adamantite-tynnonium alloy which proved to be quite durable not only under physical conditions, but against the very rifles they where using. Though she personally preferred the special metallic thread woven armor over actual solid plate armor, this was still far better than what the normal units got.
<br />

<br />

<br />
The old man certainly knew what he was doing leading the unit into Kithicor. Many a time he had traveled through this forest, with Hibiki in tow of course. This was all in Hibiki's younger years, so naturally the place did give him a familiar feeling, but also at the same time left him slightly confused. Cain knew for a fact that the unit would have more than their fair share of trouble here, which only served to make things better for him and Hibiki's escape.
<br />

<br />
"Well boy we could be in here for several days more you know."
<br />

<br />
"Why does that not surprise me, last night was already as creepy as I want it to get."
<br />

<br />
"Aw can't tell me that the big ol' rottin giant gave you the willies?"
<br />

<br />
"Well it didn't almost sit on you now did it?", Hibiki shivered as he remembered the incident.
<br />

<br />
"You do have a point on that. Which leads me to wonder just what else could be lurking here in the shadows."
<br />

<br />
"I'd rather not find out, in fact I'd rather go to High Pass Hold."
<br />

<br />
"Well we have to wait until things calm down first, can't exactly have your love kitten capturing us now can we?"
<br />

<br />
"Well at least I can find a real lady unlike a certain old man I know."
<br />

<br />
"Now that was below the belt", Cain muttered, he hated that incident more than anything else.
<br />

<br />
"Well from what I seen it was below the belt when I walked in on you two!"
<br />

<br />
"Go on an rub it in ya little pain in the arse, at least that thing didn't see us as one big bounty."
<br />

<br />
"That reminds me, what all do you know about her, since she's after us I might as well know what we're up against right?", Hibiki couldn't help but be curious as to just how come she was so strong.
<br />

<br />
"Fine, your girlfriend there is at least one fourth to one eighth kerran. Not sure what else but I suspect she might even have barbarian blood in her. Hence the reason she is so quick and was able pound you into the dirt. Another thing is she has some elven blood in her as well, probably wood elf I imagine."
<br />

<br />
"Wonderful, so how about letting me in on some of my family history now?"
<br />

<br />
Cain had always known this day was going to come, he dreaded it more than anything else too. He decided though that it was best to tell him now as they came to an abandoned cabin along the path. Once inside things would probably be more confusing for him to explain, as he wasn't sure what Hibiki really wanted to know.
<br />

<br />
"For starters you parents names are Magus and Kayla. The reason those bastards want you so badly is because of how strong your parents are. Your a very rare individual, your half human, but it is the other two parts to the other half that automatically got attentions stirred up."
<br />

<br />
"And this other half would be?"
<br />

<br />
"Now that's the trick, your one forth celestial, and one forth demon. Then again that is just an added bonus since your father wasn't an average human."
<br />

<br />
"I go from one nightmare to another..."
<br />

<br />
"The best way to describe your father is the simple term 'Spirit Master', only our bloodline carries this power. I'm not even sure what kind of power it is, but its most certainly not mana."
<br />

<br />
"As if things couldn't get any worse.."
<br />

<br />
"That and the fact you can use nearly all the innate abilities of Celestials or Demons makes you very valuable. In any case take the time now to read this book, I'm sure you can understand more about the subject that I could.", with all this said Cain pulled an old tattered book from his satchel and tossed it to Hibiki.
<br />

<br />
Cain knew the contents of the book well, he had read them many times but even he couldn't understand what was being described. It had been his own son's, grandson's, and great grandson's who had written the book, thus it was near impossible for him to understand just what they meant. If he could have, he would have used the techniques held within the book to destroy the people who where hunting them down like animals.
<br />

<br />
Things are not always as they appeared to be, or so Hibiki had been told many times. This was such a case as he began reading the book Cain had given him. It was more or less a rough journal of technique's and their effects. What stood out the most where the extra sentences in the margins that had an ethereal glow to them. The detailed descriptions of how to harness the forces to perform all of these things where astounding.
<br />

<br />
"The key to our power is our spirit, our will to survive. We do not know why ours is different than others, we only know what can trigger the awakening", these words where hard for Hibiki to speak out loud, but truth was in them.
<br />

<br />
"As I suspected, they only meant for people who had the potential to be able to read it.", all Cain could do was laugh, it was something he would have done himself.
<br />

<br />
"To trigger an awakening intense emotion and a genuine need for power have to be present. Beware of this though, for it can cause more harm than good if caution isn't exercised."
<br />

<br />
"Definite words of wisdom, at least now you know how to fight back."
<br />

<br />

<br />
The great forest around Kei was giving her the creeps now, she couldn't shake the feeling of impending doom. She could sense something out there watching them, but wasn't sure of what it was. Naturally if she told her unit they would get rattled as well, which would cause mass confusion if something did attack them. Now she knew why most sane people feared this place more than anything else.
<br />

<br />
"Commander, I keep getting blimps on the reader here, first something's there then its gone."
<br />

<br />
"It must be the surroundings, just stay calm and keep your guard up."
<br />

<br />
"I'm getting the same thing over here, maybe the researchers screwed up?"
<br />

<br />
"It doesn't matter if they did or not, we're the best and nothing here is going to get the better of us."
<br />

<br />
The attack was on without so much as a warning, no sound was heard until one of the men began screaming. It was already to late for the soldier though, even though he was alive the hopes of him surviving where slim as half of his intestines lay on the ground at his feet. A second later and another man fell to the ground, half of his head having been torn away leaving his dead body twitching on the ground.
<br />

<br />
There was a hail of rifle fire as the four surviving members of the unit fired into the darkness. Things where slowly becoming worse though, whatever it was could move quick. It was stealthy enough to evade even Kei's heightened senses. Another man was heard screaming which turned to a gurgling sound, the creature that now stood before them had ripped out his throat. It had a wide smile on it's half decayed face as blood dripped from its chin.
<br />

<br />
Instantly Kei knew what this creature was, it was one of the few that the government feared the most. It was completely uncontrollable, this having been discovered after several research teams captured one and having been decimated once it got loose again. This was what they had termed the Flesh Reaper. In the reports it was stated that it used the life force from the flesh it ate to regenerate it's own body to a state just after death. Once this was demonstrated, it was instantly put on the black list on creatures to be exterminated, having found it to be far to intelligent in its regenerated state to control.
<br />

<br />
This all disgusted Kei as she took aim at the Flesh Reaper before her and began firing. She now knew this place was damned, and if she ever survived she was certainly not coming back. The beasts movements where not like the other undead she had encountered, it could move as graceful as some of the best acrobats she had seen as a child. It's hands where more like claws though, or perhaps even blades, as yet another one of her subordinates fell to the creatures savage lust for living flesh.
<br />

<br />
Everything was going to hell around Kei and her last remaining comrade. The half eaten corpses of their fallen friends had already started to come back to life. This forest was most certainly cursed, even more so since Innoruuk's influence no longer controlled the creatures within it. All that these things wanted or cared about was causing more death, and partaking of the flesh of the living.
<br />

<br />
All Kei could do was back away and continue to fire her pulse rifle at the Flesh Reaper and its freshly reanimated victims. The last remaining man of her unit fell as its once living compatriots took to devouring his flesh before he had even died. She was now all alone with no one to help her, still she just had to survive no matter the cost. A blood curdling scream echoed through the forest as fear had finally taken over her mind.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Hibiki knew something was wrong, he could feel gnawing at the back of his mind. Something had found them and it felt as though it was watching him. This feeling rang true as something came crashing through the roof of the cabin and now stood before him and Cain. It stank of rotting flesh, and wore long forgotten garments from the past.
<br />

<br />
The old man knew just what this creature was, it was something he had seen in the past. It was what the researched had dubbed a Flesh Reaper. Amongst the creatures in this forest it remained to be one that proved to be nearly unstoppable, mostly because of its intelligence and quick regenerative abilities.
<br />

<br />
Cain hardly had time to move before the Flesh Reaper was on the move, as his luck would have it he was the closest to it. It as a good thing he was fast for an old man, otherwise the claws from the creature would have surely driven though his chest. Instead he found the creature had managed to leave its mark in the form of several claw marks that cleaved his flesh right down to the bone.
<br />

<br />
Without hesitation Hibiki grabbed a decrepit old chair and promptly mashed it over the creature's back. In return for doing such he was batted aside as if he here nothing more than a rag doll. It was apparent this creature was going after what it thought the largest threat was, namely Cain. Needless to say the old man didn't intend on becoming this things next meal, for some reason he had a smile on his face, as if he knew something neither Hibiki nor the Flesh Reaper did.
<br />

<br />
"Look out below!!!"
<br />

<br />
Zebuxoruk had naturally came looking for them after having found out they escaped into Kithicor. The Flesh Reaper never had a chance as the ungod's sword split it's stinking body in two. Cain had to give him credit, even if he was late he had always managed to pull him out of sticky situations. This time though he had cut it almost to close for comfort for the old mans sake.
<br />

<br />
"What kept you waiting?! You have the worst timing possible!"
<br />

<br />
"Sorry, I got hung up dealing with a couple things. By the way, your little search party ran into this little critters friend not to far from here."
<br />

<br />
"Well guess that means Hibiki's girlfriend is probably in more trouble than she can handle."
<br />

<br />
"She's not my girlfriend!"
<br />

<br />
"Last I seen was that all of her unit was dead, an she was barely holding them off."
<br />

<br />
"I just wanna know why that thing came for me first..."
<br />

<br />
"If you had paid any attention to some of the materials I sent you lately you'd realize these things are mana sensitive."
<br />

<br />
"So that's why it was drawn to the old man like that one hooker was.", Hibiki just loved rubbing that in, it was one of the few things he could say to get even with Cain.
<br />

<br />
"Okay, but shouldn't you go save your girlfriend now?"
<br />

<br />
"Girlfriend or not, you really should go see if she's dead Hibiki. I'll have my hands full guiding this dead weight here to safety."
<br />

<br />
"Just because I'm old don't go calling me dead weight!"
<br />

<br />
"Just why do I have to go check everything out?"
<br />

<br />
"Because your a fast runner.", both Cain and Zebuxoruk said this in unison, after all they had both seen him run before.
<br />

<br />
Hibiki just mumbled as he left the cabin and starting walking back along the path. If anything what those two had said was right, given the right motivation he could out run them both. After all being a coward did grant that kind of advantage, and at least he did live longer than most others. He knew that fighting anything in this forest usually meant a slow and painful death.
<br />

<br />
It was simple to find Kei, all he had to do was following the screaming. This made the task even less desirable for Hibiki to fulfill. He really wished he had paid more attention to the lessons that his grandpa had tried to teach him, particularly ones that involved combat. If anything he understood some of the simpler methods he had read in the book earlier, but he knew he didn't have that kind of power yet.
<br />

<br />
All Hibiki could do was look over the top of a fallen tree and watch Kei doing her best to avoid the Flesh Reaper. The weapon she was using sure packed enough of a punch to disable her friends turned enemies, but it was having little effect on the creature when it did manage to hit. He knew all to well why the old man and Zebuxoruk had sent him here, it wasn't just because he could run faster than either of them, it was the fact he could see perfectly in the darkness.
<br />

<br />
Kei was sure this was the end as she fired the final shot left in her rifle. After hearing the trigger click a few times she was certain she was all out. What made the situation worse was that without the weapon she had no way of keeping her distance from the Flesh Reaper. She did her best to avoid the oncoming attack from the beast by throwing her now useless rifle at it. This had little effect as the undead fiend drove it's claws deep into her shoulder, pinning her against the tree she was standing in front of.
<br />

<br />
She was all out of options now as she closed her eyes and waited for her death to come. It was then that she heard someone scream, then seconds later the Flesh Reaper's claws where dislodged from her shoulder. When she opened her eyes she was slightly more than surprised at who had just freed her.
<br />

<br />
"Where the hell did you come from?", Kei couldn't help but glare at Hibiki, after all he was the reason she was here.
<br />

<br />
"Just shut up and find some place to hide!"
<br />

<br />
"How dare you try to order me around! I'll have your hide for this!"
<br />

<br />
"Move it already before it de...", Hibiki's words where cut short as the Flesh Reaper came in to attack.
<br />

<br />
In his rush to shove Kei away from the beast he neglected to think of his own safety. He had turned his back which was a mistake that gained him a fresh set of claw marks across his back. Right now he wanted to run away, but he couldn't exactly leave Kei here either. Unlike what he thought she was, he couldn't let someone die by doing nothing. Now he was backed into a corner and had no idea what to do, he did have the strength he needed to defeat this creature before him.
<br />

<br />
"Some hero you are, I think I might be better off on my own then having some coward protect me."
<br />

<br />
"Would you shut up!"
<br />

<br />
Hibiki was now confused, and Kei's insults where only beginning to do something that no one else had managed to do. He was getting angry, more so than he had ever been from someone griping at him. He was tired of it all now, he didn't want to run anymore. All he ever wanted was to have a normal life, but the government simply wasn't going to allow it. Now he was about to find out just why he hadn't been left alone.
<br />

<br />
"I'm tired of it all! Everyone has always did this to me!"
<br />

<br />
Hibiki stomped his foot on the ground in a rage as streams of blackened energy began to flow into his body. Neither the Flesh Reaper, nor Kei knew what to make of all this. All the Flesh Reaper could do was start circling Hibiki as it prepared to launch another attack. Kei was simply in shock over what was happening in front of her.
<br />

<br />
It didn't take long for Kei's MTA reader to react to the spectacle before her. She couldn't understand the reading though, it had to be malfunctioning. She simply couldn't believe that Hibiki's MTA readings where still at zero. Nothing could have prepared her for what she was about to witness. 
<br />

<br />
"Ragnarok!!!"
<br />

<br />
Kei barely had enough time to react as dove into the cave behind her and lodged herself behind a rock. A rush of hot wind encompassed her as she watched a a brilliant crimson light engulf the area outside the cave, then she heard the faint screams of the undead. She certainly wasn't sure of what had happened, that is until she seen Hibiki stumbling into the cave.
<br />

<br />
"Where are you... I'm going to tear out your tongue..."
<br />

<br />
It was clear to her that something drastic had taken place outside, especially from the condition Hibiki's cloths where in. They had been charred and where in shambles, not only that but they where smoldering. All Kei could do was stay hidden from his view until she heard him fall to the ground. Whatever had happened, she certainly couldn't view him as some simpleton now, in fact he was probably more dangerous than the Flesh Reaper now...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

Chapter 3
<br />

<br />
"Revelations"
<br />

<br />
I know I've taken a break from writing somewhat. To be honest its mostly because I haven't received much in the way of feedback. Right now I'm working over the basics of finishing up my previous stories and perhaps after that I'm going to throw my self into something new. The new thing I speak of is a book I'm drawing up idea's for. I know it'll be a long and difficult process and knowing how I am, I'll probably end up writing on it before finishing everything else.
<br />

<br />
It was hard for Kei to comprehend just what had taken place outside the cave she now sat in. One moment Hibiki had appeared to be frail and weak, the next he had become the most powerful force she had seen to date. She now knew that her unit had be misinformed greatly and this was something she was going to correct once she returned. Of course she wasn't going to go empty handed, especially since she had taken the chance to shackle Hibiki quite well with the restraints the scientists had sent along with them.
<br />

<br />
This wasn't the first time her unit had information withheld from it, in fact she had come to expect it in some cases. Though this time she had a thorough reason for being angry. Anything like she had witnessed should have been presented to them up front. Even the best of the best unit's would have needed such vital knowledge. If anything now she was going to make sure she got all the money she deserved. She was determined to make sure her comrades where given proper burials and their families taken care of.
<br />

<br />
Of course now Kei could still hardly believe all that had happened. Whatever Hibiki was, he certainly wasn't anything they had come across in the past. She had never seen such raw power before exhibited in any individual. Also what astonished her was the fact that his MTA had never risen in any kind of indication that he had such abilities.
<br />

<br />
Still what puzzled her was the book she had found on him. Often she thought she could see something in the margins. She dismissed this as her mind playing tricks on her though, especially since when she tried to focus on the words it would simply vanish. The rest of the book held little interest other than that. Truth be known the book gave her the creeps with its vague descriptions that lead her mind wandering down strange trains of thought.
<br />

<br />
One of the things she was thankful for was the fact that the wandering undead had steered clear of the tunnel ever since Hibiki had entered. She didn't know if this was due to the fact that the other undead considered this to be the Flesh Reapers territory or whether it was due to the strange light she had seen outside. Both explanations didn't offer her much comfort, especially in this accursed area.
<br />

<br />
From Kei's past knowledge about Kithicor she had came to the conclusion that this cave was one of the few hidden tunnels that had connected to Rivervale or perhaps the misty thicket. She had thus deducted that due to the lack of air flow, and musty smell that the other side was either incomplete or had collapsed. This all didn't settle to well with her since she would have no possible way of escaping if something took a notion to come into the cave.
<br />

<br />

<br />
The night had been one that Cain and Zebuxoruk would have rather not had. It had taken them nearly the entire night to make it to the edge of the forest and into High Pass Hold. Their first stop as always was the closest Inn. The two of them knew that Hibiki was use to traveling, so that meant it would only be a matter of time before he eventually showed up to join them. Though the ungod had his doubts about what was happening now he had to admit that things could have been worse as the two of them took a seat at a secluded table to talk.
<br />

<br />
"Well Cain it looks like who ever wants you in the government, wants you bad this time."
<br />

<br />
"I'm not surprised about it this time. It was only a matter of time before they would pursue us so fervently. What bothers me is that woman they sent.", the old man scratched at his chin in thought.
<br />

<br />
"Yes, she is a problem isn't she? She was the one responsible for the massacre down in the Qeynos Sewers. The one that involved that cult right?"
<br />

<br />
"That's her work all right. She'll definitely be hard for me to handle alone...", Cain looked down at the table, not wanting to come to grips with reality now.
<br />

<br />
"Cain you knew very well your abilities as a sorcerer weren't going to last forever. You are one of the best alchemists I've ever seen though, you just have to take it easy for awhile. I think your problems are all due to the stress lately.", the ungod has seen this many times before. 
<br />

<br />
Prolonged stress on the body often had harsh side-effects on the magic wielders he had seen before. Though he knew Cain was exceptional even by the pasts standards, he was not immune to all this. The constant hustle and being on the run had drained him of the time he required to fully recuperate and concentrate. Surely now wasn't the best time to tell Cain of recent events, but it would have to be done an couldn't wait any longer.
<br />

<br />
"Aside from the papers they found on Cyrus and Exodus... They managed to get their hands on Cyrus. Thankfully it still hasn't had time to fully regenerate."
<br />

<br />
"Thankful?! Why didn't you tell me this sooner?! Of all things that is the worst of all that could have happened short of Hibiki being caught!", Cain's eyes narrowed as he stared at Zebuxoruk.
<br />

<br />
"They have yet to discover what it truly is. Apparently your bad handwriting and cryptic descriptions aren't helping them any.", with that Zebuxoruk gave a brief smile.
<br />

<br />
"Your lucky I don't fry you right here and now. At least I know I managed to do something right in my lifetime, even if it was bad handwriting. Anything else I should know now before Hibiki arrives?", Cain glared at the person before him as he asked.
<br />

<br />
"Well Kei's unit is not exactly the top of the line. There are several others out there that have higher profiles than hers did. So we had best be on our toes from now on since they'll most likely hire one of those."
<br />

<br />
"I gather things could have been far worse than what we could have expected then?"
<br />

<br />
"Very much so, though I don't have specific names those groups are more covert than Kei's unit was.", Zebuxoruk was always one to find out everything he wanted, but this time was not the case.
<br />

<br />
It was hard enough for him to just find the information he had gained so far. Everything relating to Cain and Hibiki had suddenly become highly classified which was one sign that someone big was pulling the strings now. The ungod didn't like this fact one bit now. It meant the future was going to be far more erratic and all to hard to determine. 
<br />

<br />
Over the past several years the ungod had came to the realization that the world was definitely changing. With the appearance of the Dread King, an the total overthrow of the Faydwer continent events where not going as he wished. Though now his hands where tied, mainly because intervention now would most likely lead to his capture or destruction. The only choice left was to let time take its course. In doing so he knew that Cain and Hibiki might be able to find a way to bring about halt against the undead that amassed and threaten the world. Perhaps they could even do something to stop the undead fiend known as the Dread King in its tracks and set the world on a path back to the way it once was.
<br />

<br />
Cain as well wished for something to happen. He wanted his family to be freed, because he was confident that they could counter the evils that threaten the world. They all contained the power that defied even the gods will, which was both a blessing and a curse. It was never his intention for things to turn out as they did now. If anything he hated himself for what had happened to the world. When things turned badly there had been nothing he could do by himself.
<br />

<br />
The fools that had done the most damage where from the governments themselves. It was their intervention and entrapments that had taken away their chances at victory. Cain could not blame them solely for such events though, it was his own tampering with the Dread Kings armor that had lead to the creation of Cyrus. Once that alone had been discovered he had been branded as a heretic by almost all in power.
<br />

<br />
Zebuxoruk knew something that his aged friend did not about the nature of the binds. The seals that had been put in place required a great deal of mana to sustain. They would certain hold out for more than the lifetimes of those who had put them in place. The fact remained though that eventually there would be no more mana to hold the seals, and then it would be to late.
<br />

<br />
The reasoning behind this was simple enough, even to Cain's eyes. Eventually people would stop worshipping the gods, and in turn the gods blessings would be no more. Once this happened the flow of mana would be cut off and that would only leave the precious little mana people themselves contained naturally, or that which Norrath itself could produce. These events where far off in the future though, probably far enough off that they could never live to see them.
<br />

<br />
"Cain there is another thing though I really must ask. Where you able to train Hibiki to use his abilities yet?", with was a burning question on the ungods mind ever since having arrived in Kithicor during the night.
<br />

<br />
"I've taught him basics of hand to hand, and I gave him the book that was written. Other then that we can only hope he has the natural ability to self awaken like the rest of them did.", the old man offered his companion a faint smile at best.
<br />

<br />
"I certainly hope so. Otherwise the next time we come across trouble it might be to late."
<br />

<br />
"Yes well I'm certain that...", Cain narrowed his eyes as he heard a voice far off towards the bar.
<br />

<br />
Cain absolutely held a hatred for whom the voice belonged to. In fact it had gained him quite a bit of harassment from the people who knew about the event that had happened. In retaliation for the embarrassment he had destroyed an alchemist store, which specialized in the illusion potion that was used. So it came to no surprise to Zebuxoruk when he saw Cain stand up and make his way over to the bar. In fact he knew what was going to happen for sure now.
<br />

<br />
"Oh Terrie... Remember me?!"
<br />

<br />
"It's you. Short, dark and handsome."
<br />

<br />
"Here we go..."
<br />

<br />
Normally Cain was good at holding his temper, but this time was different. All he could do was grab the closest thing to him which happened to be a stool an smash it across the back of the thing that stood before him. This in turn sent Terrie sprawling over the bar and a chain reaction of spilled bottles and turned over glasses took shape. Zebuxoruk had to give Cain credit though, he would have done the same thing given the situation he was put in all those years ago. Of course the man Terrie had been chatting to took this none to lightly.
<br />

<br />
"What the hell did you do that for you demented little freak?! I was just about to take her back to my place."
<br />

<br />
"Don't you mean him?", Cain sneered up at the younger fellow before him.
<br />

<br />
"Cain! Duck!"
<br />

<br />
The aged man did just as his friend had said. In doing so he avoided a chair that was aimed at his back. Naturally though it ended up striking the young man he was talking to across the chest. This set on a chain of events which ended up having everyone sitting on their stools toppling over. Unfortunate for Zebuxoruk, he soon found that not only himself, but Cain where the target of several peoples most unwanted attentions. These people just happened to be the bouncers hired by the Inn.
<br />

<br />
"Your going to have to leave now folks, we can't exactly have a brawl on our hands."
<br />

<br />
"Mind your own business muscles, I'm settling a long over due payback here.", Cain as usual was demonstrating his stubbornness as he glared at the bouncers.
<br />

<br />
"Listen up assling your going to have to leave now or face a night in the jails."
<br />

<br />
"What did you just say?!", the aged man's eyes narrowed at this, loathing being called such.
<br />

<br />
"You heard me, it's time for you to leave assling!"
<br />

<br />
Zebuxoruk took it upon himself to completely back away from Cain after hearing the latest remark from the bouncers. He knew full well that his friend was far stronger than he appeared for his age. This was made evident by the table he had managed to quickly hoist over his head and toss at the two bouncers. Naturally this had the horrible result of sending them crashing across a series of chairs and tables, this in turn sent all manner of alcoholic beverages into the air and down onto the crowd with the confines of the bar area of the Inn.
<br />

<br />
Of course the ungods present wasn't left out as some half drunken fool managed to swing a bottle at him. Normally Zebuxoruk didn't take to fighting those who where not what he considered a serious threat, but this time he made an exception as his fist connect with his assailants jaw. As fate would have it, it was Terrie whom the person stumbled backwards and eventually fell on.
<br />

<br />
After hearing the commotion several guards finally made there way into the Inn only to find themselves being bombarded by all manner of objects. It didn't matter what got into Cain's way now as he was in a full out berserkers fury. People where being tossed, kick, and pounded in all directions as the short of stature old man went about turning the place into chaos. Naturally Zebuxoruk wasn't to be left out as he too sent several people sailing through the air and out the windows of the Establishment.
<br />

<br />
The final straw came when Cain's eyes fell on Terrie who was making an rather bumbling attempt to leave. There where few things that Zebuxoruk didn't want to find himself at the receiving end of these days. One of these few was the arsenal of spells his old friend had at his disposal. In fact it was now the Ungod who dove for cover as he felt Cain begin to channel the horrendous mass of mana he was about to unleash on those who had angered him.
<br />

<br />
"All right you bloody idiots and you ignorant perversion of a man. It's time you met my wrath full on!"
<br />

<br />
A small orb of fiery mana formed before Cain's persona then levitated upwards toward the ceiling. This gave most people ample time to scramble out of the building just as the orb dropped down an forcibly slammed into the floor of the room. The resulting explosion sent Terrie, the bouncers, and the guards who had come in flying through the walls of the building. At this the owner who had managed to escape during all the commotion stood outside and watched in horror as the walls bowed outwards from the blast and the roof bubbled up.
<br />

<br />
"Are you finished now?"
<br />

<br />
"Well if you mean I feel a little better, then the answer is yes Zeb."
<br />

<br />
"Then how about we go someplace more peaceful here and wait for Hibiki to show up?"
<br />

<br />
Zebuxurok brushed off his clothes as he walked out of the building. As always he was stuck footing the bill, dropping several bags of platinum before the Owner who was on his hands and knees practically crying. Cain followed suit and kept up with the ungods pace as they began to search for yet another place they could spend the night.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Kei was startled by a sound she heard come from deep within the darkness of the cave. It sounded as if something had caved in or something had disturbed the rocks. Instincts kicked in for her as she took hold of the knife she had been given. This particular blade had been saturated in mana while it was being forged. The end result was if the user summoned mana into their hands it would charge the blade, and thus make it a much fiercer weapon. One of the side effects was it would glow in the darkness, providing a makeshift torch in the process.
<br />

<br />
It didn't take her long to reach where the noise had came from. Sure enough the rock had been disturbed and her acute hearing was picking up stone being moved from the other side. Naturally she did as she had always done in these sorts of situations, which was hide further back in the darkness. If it was a foe she would certainly have the drop on it, because to her no one was really what she could call her friend.
<br />

<br />
There was a loud rumbling from behind the wall of rock and then a fist emerged from it. Kei could tell instantly that it belonged to an ogre. She knew full well that there was no way to stop it from entering, which is just what it did by shoving the rest of the debris's out of the newly reopened entrance. Sure enough it entered, being followed by what Kei could make out as a gnarled little man that she recognized instantly as one of the higher ranking officers over her unit.
<br />

<br />
"Meza Do gud Bozz?"
<br />

<br />
"Yes, you did very good Hauss."
<br />

<br />
Considering her situation, she knew these two had been sent out to retrieve her and her team. Naturally she came out knife in hand still as she made herself visible to the two. Though she was uncertain of just how the two had come to find her, which puzzled her.
<br />

<br />
"I see you where sent to pick us up Proxis, but just how did you come to find where we were?", she crossed her arms, awaiting an explanation.
<br />

<br />
"It's not hard to track you down Kei, the weapons alone where easy enough to track. Everything from your weapons to your armor had tracers in them."
<br />

<br />
"That's understandable, and you'll be glad to know the little bastard has been caught. Though he's a hell of a lot more dangerous than any of you let on to. Your damned secrets got my entire squad killed.", Kei's eyes narrowed, if she could have she would of killed him right there for all this.
<br />

<br />
"Yes well that's an acceptable loss considering how valuable a capture it has been. Hauss go be a good fella and go get our prisoners.", Proxis just grinned and motioned for the ogre to get going.
<br />

<br />
"Sorry to burst your bubble but the old man escaped us. Blame yourself for not putting a higher priority on him. An you had best pray that little creep isn't awake, he managed to best a Flesh Reaper without any sort of weapons."
<br />

<br />
"That's very interesting indeed, but I could suspect nothing less from a 'Spirit Master' even if he is just a youth now."
<br />

<br />
Hauss had managed to make his way through the darkness an do just what had bee instructed of him. He had Hibiki slung over his shoulder as he made his way back into the view of Kei and Proxis. Unlike most of his Kin, even though he spoke like them he was far more intelligent than they where. Through the use of experiments and mental training he had managed to come far closer to what his races intelligence was like before the Pantheon had struck them down.
<br />

<br />
"Mezza Got Em! Time to goz?", Hauss gave his best smile to Kei, truth be known he was quite fond of her appearance.
<br />

<br />
"Yes, lets head back to the ship. We have much to report back to the researchers.".
<br />

<br />
Proxis didn't so much as look back at Kei as he made his way from the cave. He could tell she disliked both him and Hauss a great deal. In his case it was because of the way he treated her which he didn't mind one bit. Hauss was a different matter though, it was clear that Kei loathed both his personality and appearance. He knew the only thing that kept Kei from trying to smash both their skulls in was his rank, and her orders.
<br />

<br />
Kei on the other hand was thinking of what was going to occur once she got back to the facility. Remains retrieval was one thing she knew would take place given the location, that wasn't what bothered her. She couldn't rid herself of a feeling that not all was right and that something horrible was about to happen now. It was her natural instincts that told her there was a hideous fate in store for Hibiki, and before she went back out on an assignment she was going to discover just what that was. It was her curiosity about him that she needed to satisfy. There was something mystifying about him and she was going to find it out even if it meant interfering with what the scientists had planned...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

Chapter 4
<br />

<br />
"The Suffering, Darkness of a Soul."
<br />

<br />

<br />
For those wondering the book part I mentioned has been put on hold. I forgot to edit that part out of the chapter and decided just to leave it in. I'm writing as this all comes to me mind you, so that's why the other stories have yet to be finished. When the urge comes I must write or lose the edge on it and possibly forget an have to rethink events.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Several days had past since Kei had been retrieved from Kithicor Forest. In that time she had been keeping watchful eyes on whatever was done to Hibiki. For the majority of the time he had remained asleep due to being constantly drugged. Though he was sedated he was still pinned down to the table by a series of metal restrains. She couldn't blame them for the precautions considering how the report ended up ranking him as a creature close to the destructive capabilities of an ancient dragon.
<br />

<br />
The whole time she was there she had to contend with Hauss. With each passing day he made his presence and intentions known to her, which frankly disgusted her beyond belief. This was one area that Hauss was to stupid to understand and take a hint in. Still she had to be around him if she intended to spy on what was being done to Hibiki, considering he was made the guard for the room he was being kept in.
<br />

<br />
Today Kei knew that something horrible had happened to Hibiki especially since Hauss was no longer required to keep the room under constant watch. Furthermore, she had watched as several researchers had entered the room with several vials and a series of needles. She knew that whatever they had done was serious enough that they where certain he couldn't escape now under his own ability. Kei realized her only choice to find out what happened was to find their documents and read over them.
<br />

<br />
In her mind she had the idea that the best time to do her snooping was during the night. Any documents and other items of interest to her had not left the room. That much she was certain of now. One of her obstacles during the night would be Hauss. Over the days she had discovered he was originally the night patrol for the facility. This meant that he was most likely going to be returning to his normal duties, which meant she had to be careful.
<br />

<br />
The darkness was no problem for her partially feline eyes. Though she knew Hauss could see just as well in the night. This is what Kei thought of as she crept through the darkness of the complex. She had managed to become quite good at the arts of stealth, as she had a natural talent for anything that involved a great deal of dexterity and strength. What she had specialized in was mostly hand to hand combat, save for learning mana manipulation to boost her already tremendous natural physical strength.
<br />

<br />

<br />
The past week had been a regular nightmare for Cain as he strain all his resources to track down Hibiki. Once he had heard of where Hibiki was all he could do was conclude the worst was about to happen. It was a place he had long since feared that Hibiki could be taken to if they where captured. There where limited choices available for him now as he sat at the table, deep in thought along with Zebuxoruk. 
<br />

<br />
They had managed to move on to Neriak and as usual the choice of meeting places had been the Maiden's Fancy. Zebuxoruk wasn't surprised that even the dancers hadn't managed to draw Cain's attention away from the task at hand. This was also one of the prime places to find the help if they required it. All sorts of people, mostly mercenaries now frequented this establishment so it was actually a logical place for them to be.
<br />

<br />
"We're at a loss here Zeb, getting to that floating hellhole is gonna be hard enough as it is without having to deal with an army of guards."
<br />

<br />
"Times like this make me wish Zenki was around now. He could sneak into any place he wanted to, with no problems at all.", the ungod smiled, remembering some of the mischief he had seen from the youth.
<br />

<br />
"Your right as always. I have to admit he was, and always will be the best at doing those things.", at last Cain gave a brief smile.
<br />

<br />
The place they had found out that Hibiki was being held at was a facility that floated high above the Ocean of Tears. It was shrouded by a powerful invisibility shield, one that many skilled sorcerers could only hope to learn to achieve. Only the soldiers stationed there knew the exact coordinates of the place. This made teleportation to the place near impossible, even to Cain which is something that severely hindered their places to get Hibiki back.
<br />

<br />
In the years of the past it was now common for the governments still left in power to come to an agreement on various things. One was the facility that was now floating over the Ocean of Tears. It had at first been meant to monitor the movements of the Dread King, but now it was also being used to experiment on the undead creatures that had been captured. The physical location was perfect since even if something did go wrong none of the public would be in immediate danger.
<br />

<br />
When it had been discovered that Cain's creation Cyrus was formed from fragments of the Dread Kings armor they had sought after him and his family intensely. When it was realized that they actually posed more of a threat than the Dread King itself they had been handled in the most efficient way possible. The only problem had been that Hibiki had been taken to safety before hand to at least leave hopes for the future.
<br />

<br />
Since they now had someone capable of using Cyrus all they had done ever since was search for Cain and Hibiki. They wanted to know the secrets behind why only Hibiki's family could use the armor. If they could discover the reasoning behind this then it very well could lead to a weapon that even the Dread King itself couldn't stand up against. The problem that was presented was if the populus knew about everything that happened the governments would be persecuted and could possibly collapse from the scandal.
<br />

<br />
Cain had known all along what might happen if it was made public. In fact if it was made public that his family had actually had the abilities to confront the Dread King's army on a head to head basis, that he could escape being hunted. The problem was throwing everything into chaos would weaken defenses against the undead menace and most likely lead to total annihilation of all life on Norrath.
<br />

<br />
It was these thoughts that kept Cain from ogling the sparsely clothed and scantly clad women that danced on the bar top and tables. One of the things he knew he was going to need would be some sort of distraction, one that would at least buy them the time they needed to get to Hibiki. That and they would need an air ship, one that was moderately fast. Also he knew whom ever it was doing the disturbance would have to survive, to much blood had done been shed over his ill gotten experiments and mistakes.
<br />

<br />
The answer to his problem as impossible as he thought it would be came rushing through a door, half naked, and with a surprise on his face. Zebuxoruk's eyes caught a brief gimps of this in the crowded tavern, an then finally Cain turned to see the scene as well. The door suddenly flung open, throwing the young sparsely clothed dark elf onto the floor as a Troll woman lumbered into view.
<br />

<br />
"Damn it! You said I had to work off my tab if I couldn't pay! But you said nothing about this!", the dark elf glared over at the manager owner, obviously not liking this at all.
<br />

<br />
"It's not my fault that the only people who wanted you was a group of trollish women", the owner just smirked as he looked on.
<br />

<br />
"Wez pay good money for Inky man! Get in here!"
<br />

<br />
Zebuxoruk burst into fit of laughter, much like what Cain would as he watched several Troll women lumber through the door. Much to the dismay of the patrons they where as sparsely clothed as the dark elf man they where after which sent many into a fit of pained howls as they covered their eyes from the gruesome site. Of course their apparently purchase wasn't going to go to easily as he got to his feet and began to leap from table to table to avoid the trolls after him.
<br />

<br />
Cain watched on at the scene unfolding before him now. He wasn't laughing the least or screaming in horror like the others in the establishment. Instead his eyes where watching the actions of the young dark elf male avoiding capture. The old man had an eye for seeing the potential that some people possessed. While he could tell this one wasn't as graceful or skilled at evasion as a rogue might be, he still possessed the requirements any fighter should.
<br />

<br />
The elf was managing to hold his own against the women as he landed on a bar top. Unfortunately he took a step to gain his balance which resulted in him slip on a whiskey shot glass that sent him stumbling into two of the dancers. The bartender on the other hand had finally taken notice of what Cain was paying attention to, and most importantly he remembered he had seen him before several months earlier.
<br />

<br />
"Say aren't you that old man that was with Terrie a few months ago?", being a dark elf he said this with a smirk, figuring he could torment the old man before him.
<br />

<br />
"Just what are you getting at?", Cain's eyes narrowed slightly as his attention remained on the dark elf scrambling to apologize to the women before they decided to scratch his eyes out.
<br />

<br />
"I guess the rumors are true, you really must like men after all.", a hearty laugh escaped the bartender's mouth finding this to be enough to get a rile out of the codger of a man.
<br />

<br />
This incited the kind of reaction Zebuxoruk was accustom to from Cain. The ungod never stopped laughing as he watched his friend grab the nearest bottle to him and smash it across the bartenders face. The look on Cain's face was almost the same was the recent even in High Pass Hold, in fact if foam where to be added to his mouth people might mistake him for being rabid. 
<br />

<br />
As luck would have it the bar had a bouncer, an ogre who hoisted himself up and lumbered over to the bar. There was a quick grunt an the expulsion of foul breath as he snatched Cain up by the back of his shirt and lifted him into the air. Cain did just what anyone who knew him would expect as he managed to grab a stool with his feet and brought it up to his hands. Then the only thing  that could be seen was a blur as the stool was smashed across the ogre's face.
<br />

<br />
"Youz have to do betta then datz rabid gnome!", the ogre grinned as it spat out several chunks of wood.
<br />

<br />
This only proved to send Cain into a fury of insults as he kicked at the Ogre but only found air. It was now that Zebuxoruk stopped laughing and stood up. He wasn't exactly one to stand up and interfere in the affairs of mortals, but if something wasn't done he knew Cain would probably blow the whole place off the map. Contrary to what he let on he was quite fond of coming to the Maiden's Fancy, it showed him a wide variety of what he never seen in the world on his early years of traveling.
<br />

<br />
"Why don't you be a good Bouncer by putting him down and saying your sorry?"
<br />

<br />
"Goz be a gud Hummie and play witz the Troll galz. Youz not de Bozz here."
<br />

<br />
The ungod didn't take this insult lightly at all as he struck the Ogre full across the face. This made it drop Cain as he stumbled backwards from the blow, only to land across a table surrounded by drunks. As it was expected they had little concept of what happened except to throw a punch at who or whatever was near them. This in turn caused a bar fight to erupt with bottles and chairs being thrown in all directions.
<br />

<br />
The bouncer wasn't exactly to happy about this situation though as he stood up, batting the brawling people out of his way like gnats. He stomped his way back to Zebuxoruk who had just happened to turn around to see it had come back for seconds. This time he was caught off guard as a massive fist came down across his face which sent him into the air an through a wall. The next thing the ungod heard was the shrieks of women as he shook off the daze he was in, realizing he had landed somewhere in the women's dressing room.
<br />

<br />
"Sorry bout the intrusion ladies, by the way I must admit your a stunning lot an I'd rather much stay. Sad to say I've got a problem though so I'll just take my leave.", the ungod flashed them a smile as he stood up and stormed out of the room the way he had came.
<br />

<br />
This caused a lot of the women's faces to flush, some with anger and others with infatuation as they watched him leave. Then they seen what the focus of his attentions where, bringing forth loud cheers and shouts for him to teach the Bouncer a lesson. Cain by now had gotten up and managed to find a shield one of the patrons had neglected to grab as he stood on the bar and motioned for Zebuxoruk.
<br />

<br />
"Come on Zeb! Send him this way! I gotta nice surprise for him!", Cain smiled as he was now having fun, and for the most part putting on a show since he knew women where watching.
<br />

<br />
"All right, one Ogre coming right up!", Zebuxoruk let the ogre have it with a punch square to its chin.
<br />

<br />
What happened next by all counts the best thing the women had seen done in years. Cain swung the shield and planted it fully across the face of the oncoming Ogre, which sent it flying out a window and into the streets of Neriak. It was then that he heard the earlier focus of his attention scream out as one of the women had caught him.
<br />

<br />
"Somebody get this double ugly wench off me!!!"
<br />

<br />
"Here kid catch!" 
<br />

<br />
Cain sent the shield through the air and into the outreached hands of the young dark elf. This was just what he needed to finally get away as he smashed the shield across the Troll woman's face. That in turn gave him the chance to finally escape as he crawled across the floor and made his way out. Naturally Cain followed suit, pulling Zebuxoruk along with him as the women peered out from the hole in the dressing room wall and cheered.
<br />

<br />
Once outside Cain finally had the chance to brush himself off. Zebuxoruk for once had to do the same as they stood there awaiting a response from the dark elf. Cain had a fiendish idea now about just what he could do, and this was the perfect opportunity for him to use his cunning nature. The idea was a simple one, and now it only lacked an airship to get them where they wanted to go.
<br />
"What's your name kid?", Cain had to hold back a smile as his mischievous nature was nagging at him.
<br />

<br />
"The names Vexor, an thanks for the help back there Old Codger."
<br />

<br />
"Actually from what I over heard, you pretty much owe us for saving your skin back there. Matter a fact we have a proposition for you that involves you being paid enough to make the debt you have here go away.", at this the old man shifted his weight and sat down on the edge of a nearby fountain.
<br />

<br />
"Just what are you talking about now?"
<br />

<br />
"Oh it's nothing to bad, we just need you to do what you did in there. Minus the troll women of course."
<br />

<br />
Vexor looked at the old man before him and raised a brow. Sure he knew he owed a huge debt to the Maiden's Fancy now. Thinking back over the past couple weeks he hadn't had any sort of job at all to help pay for it either. He couldn't imagine it could be all that bad compared to just what had happened to him inside. Certainly he would now know better than to await anyone in a pitch black room like that while blindfolded ever again.
<br />

<br />
"More importantly we should find an Airship first should we not Cain?", the ungod scratched as his chin in thought now.
<br />

<br />
"I know someone with an airship, but if we take this job. Then we get paid double what my debt here is.", with that said Vexor had to hold back a devilish grin.
<br />

<br />
It was a simple enough deal, to Vexor anyway. The idea was that he owed well over 20,000 platinum to the Maiden's Fancy. That was one of the many reason he was forced into the situation with the Troll Women, but he hadn't realized it would of been trolls. If anything he wished it would have been anything but trolls. He knew from this experience he'd probably have nightmares for well over a month.
<br />

<br />
"Okay, that deal sounds fine. Lead us to this airship pilot.", Cain smirked, at least luck was going his way now.
<br />

<br />
Vexor did just as he was told, leading them down the streets of Neriak and to the Foreign Quarter. It hadn't taken long before they all stood before a small shop, obviously built with a shorter race in mind, but having been altered so that the largest of customers could enter. Instantly Cain's nose picked up the smell of silicorrosive grease and with the sightings of several gears he knew he was dealing with a gnome.
<br />

<br />
"Hey Pete, come on out I got you some customers!"
<br />

<br />
"All right, bloody Teir'Dal don't you have sense enough to knock first?"
<br />
This so called gnome by the name of Pete walked out into view, covered in grease head to toe. Normally Cain tried not to associate with gnomes, they all tended to be far to curious for their own good. If they had managed to find out the things he had researched a great many of horrible things could take place. Things that even the government could not fathom to take place.
<br />

<br />
"Pete please tell me you haven't torn the Airship apart again for spare parts!", Vexor frowned as he realized that was probably the source of the grease.
<br />

<br />
"Hell no I haven't, I just got done greasing up the gears. Accidentally got stuck in there is all.", Pete glanced at the two people he seen with Vexor.
<br />

<br />
The gnome was curious now as he took in there features. He had encountered these types of people before and they certainly didn't look to be the usual smugglers. There was something about them that gave him the chills. It was as if he had taken a look at something fierce and wild but civil at the same time.
<br />

<br />
"We've made a deal with Vexor here, we'll pay you two double the debt he owes at the Maiden's Fancy in exchange for taking us somewhere on the airship."
<br />

<br />
Cain stared at the two with a slight smile on his face as he pulled out the map and pointed directly to a spot in the Ocean of Tears. He knew full well there was going to be a slew of questions, but rather than hide the facts he was going to tell them the truth. In this way he could avoid raising the curious nature of the gnome and still manage to get everything done in a timely fashion.
<br />

<br />
"My ship can make it there in a half hour easily, but why out in the middle of the ocean?", Pete cocked his head as he looked at the map.
<br />

<br />
"Inside that area on the map is a cloaked island that floats high above the sea. We're going to go there to pick someone up."
<br />

<br />
"Well if it's smuggling your doing then you've come to the right place, my ship can outrun anything in the air."
<br />

<br />
"I assure you Pete, your ship will have to be that fast if we're caught.", Zebuxoruk just offered a slight smile to the gnome after having said that.
<br />

<br />
"Okay, okay.... Come along an we'll get this fiasco started and over with."
<br />

<br />
Pete pulled open a door and walked down several stairs. Once at the bottom he lead them down the long winding tunnel that he himself had personally crafted that lead to a concealed nook just between Nektulos Forest, and the Lavastorm mountains. It was here that he had managed to setup his Airship and keep it from the prying eyes of the military and other competitors.
<br />

<br />
Zebuxoruk had to admit this gnome sure was quick about setting things up. They had launched the vessel within just a few minutes of reaching it. It was evident now that Pete had done quite a few smuggling jobs by the way in which he worked. If he was as good as he let on, then perhaps they could make this trip without even being seen. At least that's what Zebuxoruk hoped as he sensed they where growing closer to the floating island.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Kei had finally managed to get into Hibiki's room after having to wait several times to escape detection for Hauss. Inside she found one of the more horrible displays of someone's power gone mad. Hibiki was still laying on the table just as before, except the restrains where gone only to be replaced by a manacle on each wrist with several small hoses attached to them. The contents of the tubes was easy for her to determine from the dark crimson colors inside them.
<br />

<br />
Across a table next to Hibiki was an assortment of documents as well as a crystal pendant. Curiosity got the best of her as she began to read through the papers before her. The contents where startling to her to say the least. Contained within the pages she found references to some form of armor known as Cyrus, and that the pendant must of been a power source for it. This was the speculation that the scientists had came up with, though even they questioned this theory.
<br />

<br />
The pendant itself looked as if it had been shattered by some great force, hairline cracks ran all across it's surface. As she was known to do on occasion, Kei picked up the pendant and the papers, pacing back and forth next to Hibiki's table as she continued to read about how they intended to use his blood to recreate his power in others. They also had taken the liberties to tattoo runes upon his back to further inhibit his powers as a way of controlling him if he did awaken.
<br />

<br />
Kei now regretted having captured Hibiki without finding out more about him. This was the kind of fate that not even hardened criminals would deserve. The last lines of the document stated that if his abilities and powers couldn't be copied that he was to be dissected, and his organs preserved for future experiments. This was nothing short of cold blooded murder to Kei, and she seen herself as an accomplice if things continued as planned.
<br />

<br />
There would be only one way she could stop this, and that was if she freed Hibiki and helped him escape. However, she hadn't counted on what would happen once the manacles where released. The result that she soon found out was a quick stream of blood that began to drain over the edge of the table. In her haste to stop the blood she dropped the cracked pendant on Hibiki's chest in order to apply several light bandages to the holes in his wrists.
<br />

<br />
This wasn't going to be her night though as Hauss had caught on to what she was doing. One of his many talents was being able to sneak up on people and catch them off guard. He had done just that as he crept up behind her and swatted her over the table. All he did afterwards was stand between her and door, taking pleasure in seeing her fear.
<br />

<br />
"Kei make da bigz mistake tonightz"
<br />

<br />
"Over grown bastard, you might as well take me to the brig and stop that staring already."
<br />

<br />
"Nah, Mez gonna have some gud funz with you now. Then Me might take yuz to the brig."
<br />

<br />
Kei's eyes went wide with fear as she heard those words. There was no way she could stop Hauss if he made an advance at her. Also there was nobody even around on this level to hear her screams if he was to take advantage of the situation now. The only thing she knew she could do was get up and make her way to the door any way she could. An idea came to her as she grasped one of the manacles and threw it up into Hauss's face, it was then that she make her rush for the door.
<br />

<br />
"Datz not work on me!"
<br />

<br />
The Ogre had been expected as much as he caught a hold of her by the hair as she tried to run by. There was a quick flash of light in Kei's mind as she was swung face first into the wall, then span around to face her assailant. Pain surged through her now bruising cheek as she felt Hauss's foul breath move over her flesh, then she heard him laugh and knew that things were not going to be pleasant for her now.
<br />

<br />
Something that neither had counted on was that Cyrus was in face in the room. It's nature was to feed off of emotion's, and it being composed of demonic origins meant it was finding the fear and pain that Kei was emitting to be a feast of immense proportions. Though it was damaged, it still had it's utmost instinctual drive intact. This was to protect its host or in this case suitable host under any circumstances. The only problem that presented itself for the foreign presence was that the being it was now in contact with appeared to be completely entrapped within an coma.
<br />

<br />
Also of evident concern to existence was the violent creature's presence in the room. It's primary drive was to thoroughly destroy its surroundings of immediate danger. The first thing Cyrus did was begin its link with Hibiki's mind, sifting through recent imagines to focus on the most threatening of the two creatures in the room. It soon enough had it's targeting focused solely on the behemoth of a creature that was in the room.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Zebuxoruk glared upwards into the sky as the airship came to a rest under the floating island. It was at best a trivial matter for him down as with a clap of his hands Vexor, Cain and himself where transported up to the island in a flash of gray light. He had the common sense enough to place them in the most secluded part of a courtyard, it was there that the plans would be laid out.
<br />

<br />
"Now listen kid, we need you to whip up a distraction if we're caught. Shouldn't be to hard with someone like you here.", Cain snickered as he thought back to the incident earlier in the night.
<br />

<br />
"Fine, I suppose it shouldn't be to hard to play with these guys.", Vexor feigned interest in this, after all it was something he'd done most of his life.
<br />

<br />
"I should warn you child, they have weapons you haven't seen before, and if you see them point anything in your direction start moving.", the ungod gave Vexor a solemn look having said this.
<br />

<br />
Cain took the initiative by literally throwing Vexor out into the middle of the yard, out into full view of two patrolling guards. This gave him and Zebuxoruk the time they needed to quietly make their way past the curious guards, and into the compound. Vexor on the other hand was soon to realize just what the ungod had been talking about.
<br />

<br />
"Halt! Who goes there!"
<br />

<br />
"Oh! Uh... Say this doesn't look like Neriak?", Vexor watched as the two guards stepped closer then pulled two strangle looking objects off their back much like someone would do with a sword.
<br />

<br />
"Intruder! Open fire now!"
<br />

<br />
The young dark elf had little time to move as two tiny bolts of mana erupted from the objects in their hands and spend towards him. Somehow he hand managed to just barely move out of the way, while drawing his sword in the process. The next volley of shots ended up being struck away by the blade of his sword. This was just like parrying practice for him, but the only exception was he had to be much quicker and more accurate. He only hoped that his two employers would make this quick before more guards came.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Kei let out a shriek as she felt Hauss's face coming closer to hers. It was then that her eye's caught a hold of the faint glow of the pendant on Hibiki's chest. She had no idea just what was happening, but she certainly wasn't going to let this beast before her know about it. The less the scientists or Proxis knew about it the better off she knew Hibiki would be.
<br />

<br />
Cyrus now had all the information it needed from Hibiki's memory, and it also recognized his physical make up. This was the final check that was made as Cyrus formed into a mass of dense light and engulfed his form. It being damaged meant it could only take on a slightly higher evolved form that it had previously had, but nevertheless it would ensure survival.
<br />

<br />
The light finally caught Hauss's attention as he glared over his shoulder at what was distracting him from his new play toy. He lumbered over to the table just as the light began to fade away, revealing the silver and crimson red armor that now covered Hibiki's body. It was then that he heard the alarms go off indicating someone had infiltrated the island. He was slightly perplexed as he stared down at the pitch black area where he knew Hibiki's eyes should be.
<br />

<br />
"Stoopid humanz, alwayz messin up Mez fun!"
<br />

<br />
Hauss figured a little tenderizing wouldn't harm anyone as he brought down a massive hand to strike Hibiki. Instead though he was greeted by a armor clad hand blocking the blow as two ruby red lights began to shine from two crystalline eye covers. The ogre soon found himself being flung across the room and through the door as a metallic roar erupted from the seamless visor covering Hibiki's face.
<br />

<br />
This only caused Kei to scream out in horror as she seen Hibiki stand up. She realized that this was the armor mentioned in the documents. This was Cyrus and now she could see for herself why the government wanted such a weapon. Little did she know that the creature before her was not all that had been anticipated.
<br />

<br />
Cyrus had not realized it was binding itself to a human who also had demonic and celestial heritage. It made their fusion far more complete then it ever had with Magus. Now it had the extra power it needed and the unbridled rage it had always wanted. At this it moved over to Kei, standing there and waiting for her to make a hostile move. Cyrus had complete control, and now it was determined to escape, at least until it could fully regenerate.
<br />

<br />
Hauss had managed to get to his feet from being thrown through the door. He needed no more orders now as he leapt onto Hibiki and began to try and crush him with his brute strength. Cyrus now had it's sole target placed firmly in its mind and with little effort it grasp both of Hauss's arms with its own, pulling them away from his body with little trouble. Another inhuman roar came from Hibiki as he span around, driving an armor clad fist directly into Hauss's face before taking a hold of him by the throat and literally propelling them through several adamantite reinforced walls.
<br />

<br />
Kei could only watch on now as several soldier's came running at this latest disturbance. They where to little to late as Hibiki used Hauss as a weapon by swing the ogre into them. This in turn sent the guards and their new found baggage out into the main hallway in which guards where running down now to confront the intruder out in the courtyard.
<br />

<br />
The guards first instincts where to fire their rifles at this armored person in front of them. This only proved to be in vain as the mana shots simply rolled across Cyrus and struck the walls around Hibiki. Cyrus was going to get in its fill of blood and carnage tonight as it began to tear into its newly acquired targets. Kei would be the witness now of one of the most brutal of all blood baths to grace the face of Norrath as she saw gushes of blood erupted into the air as Cyrus's claws found their marks across the guards bodies.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Zebuxoruk stopped as he heard the commotion in the hallway just before them. He motioned Cain to move forward slowly as the two took the chance to look around the corner. What they found was something neither had counted on. They seen Cyrus, though somewhat abnormal looking had been activated, and they could only guess it had been Hibiki. Also they could tell that he was in a full out blood driven rage, an it was that very thing that made them turn and run back to the courtyard.
<br />

<br />
Cain and the ungod had both seen the kind of damage Cyrus could do while in an uninhibited state. Their best bet now would be to get back to Vexor and then watch on the airship from a distance to see where Cyrus took Hibiki. They said nothing as they came into the courtyard, shoving the guards out of the way and grabbing a hold of Vexor.
<br />

<br />
"Time to go kid, this place is about to become moon dust!"
<br />

<br />
"Just what the hell are you talking about?!"
<br />

<br />
"Trust the old mans words its time we got...", Zebuxoruk's words where cut short as he seen Cyrus make its way into the courtyard.
<br />

<br />
Cyrus was now having a hard time keeping up with all the movement going on around it. It had managed to lose track of the soldier's that where now rushing out into the open yard as it slowly made its way to the center. What it could determine though was that the woman from the room had managed to follow it. It also had managed to sense a person of greater strength entering the area, which just happened to be Proxis.
<br />

<br />
All Cain, Zebuxoruk, and Vexor could do was conceal themselves in the shadows as they watched what looked like an entire army surround Cyrus. They where all equipped with the same weaponry that Kei had tested out in Kithicor forest, and they all had Hibiki in their sights. Not only that but Proxis had given orders to his more higher ranking personnel to evacuate the island. 
<br />
Proxis knew from the records just what was standing before him and he knew that at the moment they had nothing to combat it. So retreat was the only option now for his most prized of fighters. By now Kei had made her way into the shadows to observe, only to end up running into Cain and the others in the process, this didn't suit the old man at all as he glared at her.
<br />

<br />
"Zeb its time we got moving, we're taking her with us... The least we can do is pump some information out of her."
<br />

<br />
Cain motioned for the ungod to get them back to the airship. It was then that the gray light encompassed them and returned them to the awaiting transportation below. Pete having seen they came back with someone else instantly got the airship moving as fast as it could go away from the island. The old gnome wasn't about to stick to be caught, and certainly not by the likes of what knew must of been the military on that island.
<br />

<br />

<br />
"Everyone Attack!!!", Proxis gave his command then quickly moved back into the complex.
<br />

<br />
All he could do now as press the button on his wristband as he too disappeared from the island. Though it was a dear sacrifice, he still had the documents and most importantly the supply of blood that had been moved from the island earlier that night. If Hibiki where to die now it wouldn't be such a great loss, at least now they could formulate some idea's on just what he was.
<br />

<br />
The soldier's instantly followed Proxis's orders as they began firing on Hibiki. Cyrus wasn't going to tolerate this though as it propelled Hibiki up into the air. It maneuvered through the air with little difficulty, avoiding the mana shots while at the same time sending out a scattering wave of emerald colored orbs. Upon impact the orbs exploded, decimating whatever they came in contact with whether it was flesh or stone.
<br />

<br />
Cyrus knew it's power would be limited in this damaged state so it was purposely sending its targets into a confusion and making them scatter. It would need time to finish them all off in one shot. This decided it landed as the chest plates, as well as abdominal and shoulder plates retracted to reveal emerald crystalline lens. Instantly a charge began to form in the crystals, then the unpredictable happened as each lens shattered.
<br />

<br />
It had made a mistake and now had no way of stopping the chain reaction beginning. Since the energies had no way to escape they where beginning to build up within Cyrus and Hibiki's body. The damage that had been done to Cyrus had in turn caused the lenses to crack under the strain. Quickly it began to sort through options, taking from its most basic memory the methods it knew would expel the energy before it took both its life, and the life of its host.
<br />

<br />
An earth shattering scream erupted from Hibiki as the power was transferred into a field around Cyrus. Suddenly it expanded outward and engulfed the island in a brilliant white flash of light. Nothing was saved from the resulting mass of light as everything was burnt asunder. Not even bone remained as Hibiki, still covered in Cyrus fell down towards the ocean in a ball of dim white light.
<br />

<br />
Cain having seen this realized that they would have to search for Hibiki, no matter how long it took. He simply wasn't going to let his own flesh and blood remain lost. Kei also knew she would have to search for Hibiki. It was mostly her fault that he had become that monster, and that he had been experimented on. What she didn't know was what Cain would do to her or for that matter if him and his friends would even let her live to find Hibiki...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

*Chapter 5 Preview*
<br />

<br />
As keen and sharp as many a sailor have been there still wasn't but few who had the fortune, or was it unfortune to reach a most interesting island. It rested surrounded by a dense ring of mist, hidden well within that was a ring of jagged rocks. Only a small opening was in this area, and even then it was hard to find through the unrelenting fog. It is in this very ring, and on the island that the most unlikely of individuals was saved from the wrath of the sea. He was playing a definite roll now, an important one that most would have given their lives just to reach.
<br />

<br />
Of all the island in the sea, this one was special for more than just its mist. It was home to a particular tribe of wayward amazons. They worshipped the god E'ci, and further more race had never become an issue for their survival. What had become an issue was their requirement of men, and it was rare now that they had the chance to raid a seafaring vessel. The arrival of the "The Runed One" was believed to be the answer to the prayers made to the ice goddess. 
<br />

<br />
Little had they realized though at the so named individual was going to put up such a struggle to stay free. In stead of capturing him they had instead spent months hunting him regularly with no results. Today was such a day as voices of enraged women echoed through the lush jungle that covered the island. Once again they had spotted their prey and today they intended full well to capture him.
<br />

<br />
"Seize him at once! Don't let the Runed One escape again!"
<br />

<br />
The Runed One as he was called was labeled this because of the archaic symbols that adorned his back. Not even the most educated of the amazons was able to decipher the meaning of the runes, which had obviously been tattooed on the young man's back. The only other identifying marks about the lad was the strange crystalline pendant that was always worned around his neck at all times.
<br />

<br />
This was the life that had been forced upon him now. Hibiki had been fortunate enough to survive the savage sea, but this was perhaps even worse. Cyrus itself had managed to only remove the runes on his back associated with some of his intelligence. The end result was a primitive mind that was able to use just a small fraction of its bodies true abilities. Thankfully thiw as enough to give Hibiki the edge he needed to survive the trials he faced each day.
<br />

<br />
Today was far different though as the Amazons had decided that far greater, and brutal methods would have to be used to succeed. This was emphasized by the explosions that soon trailed after Hibiki as bolt after bolt of mana collided with the ground. Hibiki's only saving grace was that he attained a speed and agility like that of nothing he had before. In fact if his mind was completely freed of its acursed bonds he would have been taunting and teasing the women.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

Chapter 5
<br />

<br />
"A Lost Soul's Struggle, The Island of Mists."
<br />

<br />

<br />
Its time to kick off another spree of madness from my mind. Actually its been awhile what with how I have had classes and all. With some luck maybe all this will work out right and give everyone the excitement they've been deserving?
<br />

<br />

<br />
As keen and sharp as many a sailor have been there still wasn't but few who had the fortune, or was it misfortune to reach a most interesting island. It rested surrounded by a dense ring of mist, hidden well within that was a ring of jagged rocks. Only a small opening was in this area, and even then it was hard to find through the unrelenting fog. It is in this very ring, and on the island that the most unlikely of individuals was saved from the wrath of the sea. He was playing a definite roll now, an important one that most would have given their lives just to reach.
<br />

<br />
Of all the island in the sea, this one was special for more than just its mist. It was home to a particular tribe of wayward amazons. They worshipped the god E'ci, and further more race had never become an issue for their survival. What had become an issue was their requirement of men, and it was rare now that they had the chance to raid a seafaring vessel. The arrival of the "The Runed One" was believed to be the answer to the prayers made to the ice goddess. 
<br />

<br />
Little had they realized though at the so named individual was going to put up such a struggle to stay free. In stead of capturing him they had instead spent months hunting him regularly with no results. Today was such a day as voices of enraged women echoed through the lush jungle that covered the island. Once again they had spotted their prey and today they intended full well to capture him.
<br />

<br />
"Seize him at once! Don't let the Runed One escape again!"
<br />

<br />
The Runed One as he was called was labeled this because of the archaic symbols that adorned his back. Not even the most educated of the amazons was able to decipher the meaning of the runes, which had obviously been tattooed on the young man's back. The only other identifying marks about the lad was the strange crystalline pendant that was always worn around his neck at all times.
<br />

<br />
This was the life that had been forced upon him now. Hibiki had been fortunate enough to survive the savage sea, but this was perhaps even worse. Cyrus itself had managed to only remove the runes on his back associated with some of his intelligence. The end result was a primitive mind that was able to use just a small fraction of its bodies true abilities. Thankfully this was enough to give Hibiki the edge he needed to survive the trials he faced each day.
<br />

<br />
Today was far different though as the Amazons had decided that far greater, and brutal methods would have to be used to succeed. This was emphasized by the explosions that soon trailed after Hibiki as bolt after bolt of mana collided with the ground. Hibiki's only saving grace was that he attained a speed and agility like that of nothing he had before. In fact if his mind was completely freed of its accursed bonds he would have been taunting and teasing the women.
<br />

<br />
Over the past months Cyrus itself had managed to regain the majority of its capabilities. If anything it could now completely understand everything that was happening around it. Only a few hairline cracks remained through its crystalline form now. In reality it mean that it couldn't quite function at maximum capacity, but now it was far more able to distinguish friend from foe. This is why it hadn't reacted upon the assaults from the women on this island. It had understood that they where only trying to survive, but still Cyrus was not going to let them catch Hibiki.
<br />

<br />
In fact Cyrus had been functioning as a kind of guide to Hibiki now. It had managed to tap into his mind on rare occasions and work within the confines the Runes had made in order to help him escape capture. Though it was also obvious that when its young master slept at the entity also was trying to come to a way to remove those obstacles it loathed so much. It hated the Runes with a passion now, they where inhibiting the lions share of Hibiki's natural abilities which was a real threat to his own well being. 
<br />

<br />
As each day passed though Cyrus was beginning to translate the archaic language. Today though it would have far greater problems to handle. The island locals had decided to take the daily challenge of escaping to a hire level. This was evident as explosions of pure mana burst up all around Hibiki as he continued to run in hopes of managing to out run his pursuers. Things had now definitely become far more hectic, as Cyrus could sense the distress Hibiki was feeling now.
<br />

<br />
"Get the Runed One now girls!!!", that was the ordered bellowed out by the search party's leader.
<br />

<br />
Hibiki would soon discover what the shout involved as two well placed staff blows crossed his stomach and face. The end result had him sliding across the ground without his bearings, they had ambushed him. It had been something the women had worked on for a long time, they had came to the conclusion that only their fastest runners could do the job. This fell to the two women by the name of Lina and Rina. They where the only twins born on the island for several decades, what made them special though was that they where part elf and part Kerran. Even stranger yet was they retained the majority of the appearance of elves, though they had come to have fangs, a tail, and ears that appeared very much like their Kerran heritage.
<br />

<br />
Instincts told Hibiki to take to the tree's, and as he attempted to do so he found out that the twins who had managed to match his great speed had in fact surpassed it. He would have been surprised if it wasn't for the fact that they had already managed to swat him back down to the ground with their staff's. It was now that Hibiki's primitive mind reached out to Cyrus for the answer to his dilemma.
<br />

<br />
Naturally Cyrus took the opportunity to mesh its mind with Hibiki and lend its knowledge to its Master. Contained within the crystalline entities newly recovered memories where some of the most basic of fighting skills that Hibiki's own father had possessed. This also meant that these very same skills where now being forged into the most basic mental capacities that Hibiki had now.
<br />

<br />
While all this was taking place the search party had managed to surround Hibiki as the twins where circling him. They knew from past experience that he could be very tricky, and this time they weren't going to take any chances. After all the last time that any men had been on the island was at least 10 years ago, which meant that Hibiki was someone they weren't going to simply let escape now that they where so close to having him captured.
<br />

<br />
The knowledge that Hibiki had gained from Cyrus was invaluable now. This was made apparent as he slid into a defensive stance much like his father before him had done. All he needed to do was gain some sort of weapon, anything at all would do for this situation. After only a few seconds his sights where set on one of the staff's that the women surrounding him where carrying.
<br />

<br />
Everything happened so suddenly neither of the twins had time to react. Hibiki had managed slip to the side and within his hands rested a staff. He had managed to disarm one of the amazons that surrounded him and now he was prepared to defend himself as he gave the pole a quick spin in his hands before letting it come to a rest horizontally behind him. In the blink of the eye both Rina and Lina came in to attack, and at the same time a wood crash was heard as their staff's met Hibiki's.
<br />

<br />
It was never said that the twins never learned from their mistakes. Since Hibiki obviously had a weapon they knew full well that they would have to disarm him in some fashion or another. They could tell by the way Hibiki held the staff now that he could use it to some proficiency. The two having come to this conclusion took the initiative now, each bringing her weapon down side by side towards Hibiki's head.
<br />

<br />
Just as easily as it was attained, the staff in Hibiki's hands broke under the combined forces exerted by the two that stood before him. Little where they to know that this was more of advantage having the two sections of the staff as he once again showed some skill and span them within his hands. It was now time for Hibiki to take the offensive and with a rush forward he entered a fray between the two, matching their attacks blow for blow. Any who tried to intervene soon found themselves being struck rather fiercely with the batons that he held before being kicked away.
<br />

<br />
Cyrus on the other hand was keeping careful tabs on just how much power Hibiki was expending during the fight. He was well within the limits the runes on his back had set, it also knew this was not the best the amazons had to offer. It was then that Hibiki's darker and perhaps more fierce instincts. The pain that ebbed from the women where feeding his demonic side, and thus he was being driven into a frenzy. However, this is a curse that all who carry demon blood have to face at one time or another. Most already know how to control their battle lust, even Hibiki's mother knew full well when to keep her emotions in check. The fault in this case though lay in the fact that Hibiki knew not of such things, all he knew of was survival.
<br />

<br />
Both Lina and Rina found themselves in a awkward positions as their staff's suddenly shattered under one of Hibiki's blow. However, his batons suffered the same fate as wood splinters fell to the ground before them. This was a savagery they had not seen out of this young man yet, and perhaps it wouldn't be the last as the once confident hunters found themselves being flung this way and that. Only one person watched on at this spectacle as she had not found it necessary to join the fight. This lone woman was the very leader of the island, an now she had a greater understanding of what now stood before her.
<br />

<br />
"I see you do have some strength hidden beneath that phasad you so carefully employed.", with this Ramyra gave a slight smile.
<br />

<br />
He was strong this much the woman of erudite decent could tell she observed just now. Although her main concern was why he hadn't spoken to them even during all this time. Normally stranded men tend to welcome them with open arms, yet he had did just the opposite. There was something unnatural about his actions, and perhaps she thought it lay in the runes that where on his back. She was not about to take it easy on Hibiki though, all that they needed for was him to live long enough to perform what she knew was the duty of all the men who came to this island.
<br />

<br />
All this would be solved later though, she knew this as he launched herself forward intending full well to use hand to hand combat to ensure a victory. This was a nightmare for Cyrus though as it constantly felt Hibiki pushing his body ever harder to keep up the advantage. The worst was going to happen as the crystal sensed its master had come to his restrictions. Whomever this was, she had played her hand well.
<br />

<br />
"Your at your limits, you should give up while you still can.", at that Ramyra backed away.
<br />

<br />
She expected Hibiki to do just that, but he still remained focused on her awaiting her next assault. This only proved to infuriate her, and as such her body began to saturate in mana. Ramyra was going to finish this off here and now as ice crystals began to form in the ever cooling air about her body. From what she had seen, freezing him for a short time wouldn't do unwanted harm to him. Still she was a bit puzzled as Hibiki raised his hands as if he was going to counter. She had sensed no mana built up from him, so in her mind she couldn't understand how he was going to defend on this.
<br />

<br />
"I'll show you just what E`ci's Wrath can incur, your ours now.", with that said a stream of super cooled water formed from the crystals and made its way towards Hibiki.
<br />

<br />
"Pyro Crest!", these where the only words Hibiki had spoken since having come to the island, yet the mass of heat and crimson bolt of energy that erupted from his hand was enough to show he was ready counter just what was coming towards him.
<br />

<br />
Cyrus bore witness to the results as the massive stream of water, and the bolt of pure condensed heat collected forming an explosion of steam that permeated the surrounding area. It also shirked back from Hibiki's mind as the runes punished him for defying their limits. This punishment was a far unimaginable pain that coursed through the young man's body just as the runes themselves ignited in brilliant orange and white light. The ending result left Ramyra clutching her ears as Hibiki's howl of pain caused a chill to run up all the women's spines as he slipped into unconsciousness.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Little could anyone have predicted what was coming to the island though. Proxis had mobilized a small ocean search party to track down Hibiki and the Cyrus at all costs. He wanted the armor back, and he wanted the young man either captured or terminated. The blood that had been extracted already showed marvelously results, in fact one of the results was heading to the island to handle the mission.
<br />

<br />
The result was a creature called Acidron, it had been a Flesh Reaper up until the moment that some of Hibiki's blood had been injected into its body. That savage creature it was had fully regenerated and could now manipulate its body to its own whims. Not only that, but it had regained its higher mental abilities. First and foremost he had been a soldier before being slaughtered in the Kithicor forest.
<br />

<br />
The pain of death that had plagued Acidron had been taken away the moment the experimentation on him was over. He now looked just as he did before death, and now he was ready to enact revenge on the person who had caused his untimely demise. It had been Hibiki, who's flight into the forest that he deemed responsible for his fate now. Any that stood in his path now would meet a fate far worse than death.
<br />

<br />
"Acidron, we're just outside the ring of debris surrounding the island we will be ready to land on the island no earlier than the middle of tomorrow."
<br />

<br />
"That will be fine, go ready the troops and brief them on the plans.", this was all said with a jagged toothed smile on Acidron's face.
<br />

<br />
Naturally Proxis had been rather surprised at what had manifested from Acidron's exposure to Hibiki's blood. Needless to say he had been happy at the outcome, but also knew that this was only the tip of the proverbial iceberg when it came to all the possibilities that could occur. He simply wasn't going to stop till he had reached the limits of what Hibiki's blood could achieve, even if that meant the creation of a monster far worse than the Dread King.
<br />

<br />
Even as Proxis now fathomed what could happen in the future the various experiments he had ordered where being done. Acidron was to be the first of a new classification of monstrosities to grace this ever darkening world. Though it was still hard to determine just what horrors would lay in waiting because of this. Furthermore, Cyrus was a different matter entirely. The spectacle that he had witnessed before was most likely only a taste, and since the armor looked to be damaged there was no telling what it could do in top condition. All that Proxis now knew was that the answer to some of his questions would be answered after this mission was completed...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

Chapter 6
<br />

<br />
"Lost and Found, Into the Darkness."
<br />

<br />

<br />
Sometimes fate deems it that certain people are to endure hardened paths that they must walk. Over the coarse of the last half year Cain has realized this all to well. In truth it was not only he that was experiencing the hardship, but Zebuxoruk and Kei as well. They where not alone now though as Vexor had managed to constantly lend his aid when required. What could not be understood was why Kei had been allowed to live. Little had she realized just what the ancient little man had in store for her.
<br />

<br />
Cain never was one to let an opportunity pass him by and this was such a case as he had taken everyone to an ill gotten place called Befallen. It was deep within its confines that he had an all to well kept secret, one which would be revealed. The time had definitely come for him to pull out all the stops and show everyone just what he had done. Now everyone would see the Horrors he had done in his earlier years.
<br />

<br />
"I'll warn everyone now, that waits us is far more than what most people are accustom to seeing.", Cain looked down as he prepared to open the doorway to his most secret of laboratories.
<br />

<br />
"Like anything could be worse than what I seen back in Neriak.", Vexor as always was ever so closed to the fact that there where things even the Teir'Dal could not do.
<br />

<br />
"You wasn't the one who seen what they did to Hibiki...", at having said this Kei's eyes averted to the floor.
<br />

<br />
The old man simply nodded his head and pushed on the rocks before him. This was all it took to open the way for them as they quickly made their way into the newly opened room. Torches along the walls where the first to light up, then several orbs hung from the ceiling ignited to reveal the confines of the room. What was seen was vat after vat of solutions, some containing what looked like deformed undead beasts, while others simply had crumbled crystalline looking entities contained within them. Then there was the table with an assortment of weapons, swords not unlike the ones Kei had seen at the governments testing facilities. During all this Zebuxoruk was quiet, his eyes falling across the shelves upon shelves of books situated behind a desk.
<br />

<br />
"It was here that Cyrus was originally created, what you see now is the failures that came before the success.", with having come back here Cain somehow felt more relieved.
<br />

<br />
"So these are the half replications of the Dread King then? One question I have is why is it that Cyrus only reacted when it touched Hibiki?", curiosity had gotten the best of Kei as she looked about the room.
<br />

<br />
"Cyrus was created to only bind to my relatives. It was created as a kind of limiter for a Spirit Master. I discovered that when a Spirit Master uses their power uninhibited, that it is very possible for them to destroy themselves as well as the innocents that could be around them.", Cain sighed and reached, picking up an old dusty book.
<br />

<br />
"What he's trying to say is that it's meant to be a kind of protection. Cyrus's instincts are to protect itself and its host.", with this Zebuxoruk turned his attention back to Cain and the book in his hands.
<br />

<br />
"Eventually I gave up on the pure replica of the Dread Kings armor, simply put it didn't have the potential to adapt or help my family tap into enough power. That's why I added in samples I attained from a demonic being, and that of a celestial. The first creation of that was Cyrus surprisingly enough.", the old man smiled as he flipped through the pages.
<br />

<br />
"Then does that mean there was a second?", Vexor was intrigued by what he was being told as he leaned against a wall.
<br />

<br />
"Cyrus was the only one that came to life of the two crystals I created. As you both seen it was very adaptive at the base. The problem is that Cyrus became damaged somehow, so its not restricting the saturation of power within Hibiki's body. I think the reason was Hibiki's own heritage.", at this the old man closed his eyes hating what he had created.
<br />

<br />
"Celestials are solitary beings and for the most part neutral, but they oppose most demonic creatures. Since Hibiki's mother was half of each it means that now Cyrus can synchronize more completely.", the ungod nodded as if somehow understanding something unsaid.
<br />

<br />
Kei finally took the time now to observe the rest of the containers of liquid.  It was in one that she noticed a solitary amber crystal. Curiosity had gotten the best of her as she tapped on the glass wall, wondering if what she saw as real or just an illusion. The reaction she got wasn't one she would have expected as a faint glow erupted in the solution.
<br />

<br />
This did not go unnoticed as Cain's attention was brought to the vat. It was very odd for him to see this sort of reaction especially since Cyrus had began to glow immediately. Perhaps it fell to the fact that Cyrus had classified itself as a masculine entity. If such was the case then Cain surmised that maybe this one was its exact opposite and that it was resonating now because a woman was present.
<br />

<br />
"I'd say your experiment wasn't a complete failure there Cain. Truth be told it looks as though it rather likes Kei's company.", Zebuxoruk gave a brief smile as he contemplated just what was happening before him.
<br />

<br />
"This gives me an idea, a slim idea at that. I molded Cyrus's most basic of parameters to include the ability to locate others of my bloodlines. In other words, thinking about finding someone will result in being able to sense where they are.", at this Cain sat down at the desk and began to rummage through all the aged notes there before him.
<br />

<br />
The search in itself was more harrowing than one might have expected. Cain never was one to keep papers in any sort of order. He had to of had the worst filing system in the world, and quite often people had said it was out right organized chaos. Naturally though Zebuxork did his part to aide Cain in his search, especially since it meant the faster the papers where found the faster they could find Hibiki.
<br />

<br />
Kei in the meanwhile had been transfixed on the crystal in the container before her. It now had a dim aura around it since it had first shown a sign of life. The thing had a hypnotic pull on her mind as though it was reaching out for her mind. She was uncertain though now as her eyes averted to all the searching going on. Did the crystal want to communicate with her, or was there something else that it wanted to do? There was most certainly a reason to be afraid since she had seen what Cyrus had done to the research facility. It had managed to take control of Hibiki, but she questioned whether it would have done so if he had been awake and conscious of his surroundings.
<br />

<br />
Vexor on the other hand had other things he was more enamored with. Mainly the collection of swords on a table just beside him. Each looked as though they had been specially forged and tempered, all save for one oddity amongst the fine weaponry. The stranger amongst all the swords was a solitary hilt, one that apparently had no blade to it at all. Curiosity got the better of him as he picked it up and got the shock of his life, literally.
<br />

<br />
"Gods be damned what is this thing?!", with this said Vexor dropped the hilt and clutched his now spasming hand.
<br />

<br />
"That would be Exodus, you'll have to forgive it. Of course I suppose after several years of being left alone here to heal it would be a slight bit angry.", at that the old man began chuckling as he scanned each page that ran through his fingers.
<br />

<br />
Without warning the amber crystal in the solution flickered violently. The calling Kei had been under only intensified with this apparently renewed resolution from the sentience before her. She finally came to the decision that no matter what happened to her, that maybe if she did what she felt was right that amends could be made. At that she placed her hand on the glass wall, and in that very instance the barrier shattered only to leave the solitary stone hovering before her.
<br />

<br />

<br />
It had not taken long for the troops to finish docking their water craft at the beach. Everything was going according to plan as Acidron lead his forces into the dense jungle. He was heading directly for where he sensed Hibiki. Also his heightened abilities where now focusing in on the many other people he could detect around his enemy. 
<br />

<br />
The troops themselves had been very well prepared for combat here. Each had been giving upgraded MTA readers, as well as new assault rifles. These had been specially designed to far more accurate, as well as having new power settings for intensity. The power source for them had to be specially designed, and thus the mana batteries where officially labeled class S. Even their armor was vastly improved over the previous models, but even so it could only take very few regular shots from the rifles they carried before it failed and left them open to attack.
<br />

<br />
Acidron on the other hand had only been given a new test rifle. At Proxis's orders the shot's it fired would pack just as much power as the highest setting on the other rifles issued to his troops. The draw back for this was its power supply had to consist of a bulk package of class S mana batteries which meant that a regular grunt could barely pick the weapon up, let alone use it with any proficiency.
<br />

<br />
One of Acidron's many new found abilities was that of being able to hide his presence from more sensitive people. In fact he could cause this effect to expand over an area just large enough to conceal his troops from detection. If they where going to be encountering people then he definitely wanted to do by surprising them first and not giving them a chance to mount any kind of defense.
<br />

<br />

<br />
The amazons had actually set about the day by preparing for the festivities to be held later that night. They weren't going to waste any time in putting Hibiki to use. Unfortunately Cyrus wasn't much help since it had been taken by a child the very moment Hibiki had been brought into the village. Since this had happened Cyrus had been formulating just what Hibiki might do if he couldn't tap into the knowledge it held. Things had suddenly become to complicated for it to come to a reasonable conclusion though, especially since it could sense something dark approaching from a distance.
<br />

<br />
On the other hand Hibiki had did well to regain his consciousness, of course he started by struggling against his bindings. The women had been a crafty lot though, as they had managed to use shackles rather than ropes to subdue him. This didn't matter though as Hibiki still put up great effort into trying to free himself. There was a feeling of being alone that nagged at his mind, tormenting him. He was afraid, mostly of the fact that this was all unknown to him. Thankfully Hibiki's hearing was one of his many inborn talents that hadn't been bound by the runes, which let him overhear the actions outside.
<br />

<br />
The twins, Rina and Lina had been out in the forest gathering things needed for the ceremony to be held that night. What they had discovered was far more threatening rather than helpful in the least. The two had been stumbled across a large group of men, heavily armored ones that carried weapons they hadn't seen before. Naturally they had come rushing back to the village, knowing full well that these where not shipwrecked sailors, but instead where invaders.
<br />

<br />
"Ramyra we've got trouble.", all Rina could do was gasp for breath as she had come to a stop before her leader.
<br />

<br />
"Invaders are come here, they're not far behind us.", Lina too had to take time to catch her breath.
<br />

<br />
Ramyra had always known a day like this might occur. It would have been foolish for her to think that the island would always stay safe. This was one of the lessons the leader before her had passed down. Still she had always hoped that this wouldn't happen during her time in power, but obviously this didn't matter now. Her main concern was that for her peoples futures and she stood firm in her belief that the Runed One was the solution to it.
<br />

<br />
"Rina, go release the Runed One.", Ramyra gave the younger woman a stern look at having said this.
<br />

<br />
"But we spent all those months trying to capture him!", Lina couldn't understand just what was happening, and so she asked as her sister ran off to do as she was told.
<br />

<br />
"If we survive this, but the Rune One dies, then we won't have a suitable man right? If we release him now then they will have just as hard a time catching him as we did.", Ramyra knew this went against everything she had been taught, but it was their only choice.
<br />

<br />
Rina was doing what she was told, which meant she was unclasping the shackles from Hibiki's hands. She could understand the looks she was receiving from him. In fact if she was captured and held like this she imagined she would have done the exact same. Once he was free though she soon found herself the recipient of a hefty shove as Hibiki bolted out of the tent hut and instantly leapt into the tree's to make his escape.
<br />

<br />
In the meantime Acidron and his men had finally come to their destination, or so he thought as he gave a menacing sneer while scanning the village. He could sense Hibiki here, and knew that these women where probably giving him shelter. He wasn't here for them though, after all it wasn't them that had caused his dead. He was here for only one thing, which he was going to make clear.
<br />

<br />
"I believe you have a young man here in this village, one that carries some strange markings on his back. Hand him over an we will leave here without causing you any harm.", Acidron said all this with a grin, baring his jagged teeth to the women before him.
<br />

<br />
"We have no such man here, we have no men at all here so leave now or prepare to fight.", all Ramyra could do was glare at this thing before her.
<br />

<br />
"Very well then. Everybody level the village, then we'll go about finding Hibiki."
<br />

<br />
At those orders there was a hiss as the rifles gathered mana from their batteries. Seconds later the amazons had all, managed to barely duck for cover and bolt after bolt ripped through their huts. They where at a disadvantage now, especially since they couldn't get in close enough to use their staves. What made matters worse was any significant spell took far to long to prepare, so they where stuck doing their best to avoid the shots.
<br />

<br />
Ramyra on the other hand had taken hold of her staff and was intent on preventing Acidron from doing as he wished. She soon discovered though that he wasn't encumbered by the large weapon he carried. He was avoiding her strikes with as much grace and talent as some of her own amazons had demonstrated. It wasn't long before she catch a glimpse of what was happening to her compatriots. They had been surrounded and where slowly being forced into a group, and she too was finding herself forced that way as Acidron finally began to fight back.
<br />

<br />

<br />
All Hibiki had done since being set free was leap from tree to tree in order to get as far away from the village as he could. He would have kept on going until he realized that Cyrus was missing. It became apparent to him that the crystal had been left in the village, and if he wanted to feel its presence he would have to go back there.
<br />

<br />
There was no other choice for him, at least not now as he quickly made his way back the way he had come. What he saw he couldn't quite understand, yet it all seemed familiar. He knew whatever the strange looking people where holding was dangerous. For some reason he was experiencing an odd sensation. Though the amazons had treated him like an animal, he also knew it was not right for them to endure all this.
<br />

<br />
Soon enough his eyes locked in on the crystal that dangled around the little girls neck. It was reaching out for him, he could almost feel its ever intuitive presence. He now had no choice, if he wanted to get Cyrus back he would first have to handle these strange people. Then he would have to deal with the amazons.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Acidron's eyes narrowed as he his eyes settled on a pendant he knew was part of the reason he was here. Before he could take a step forward he came to find the other reason as two of his men where sent flying past him as if they where rag dolls. Hibiki was now standing before them all, just as he had stood before the amazons the day before.
<br />

<br />
"Open fire on him now!", this was the order that Acidron barked out, he wanted Hibiki dead at all costs.
<br />

<br />
Hibiki had other plans though as he sped around the incoming mana bolts. He wasted no time as he came to the first soldier in his path and delivered a palm strike to his chest that literally left a palm imprint on the armor he was wearing. At that very moment two other soldiers had abandoned their rifles only to draw their swords. Hibiki did just what he had learned from Cyrus and landed a near perfect Crescent kick down across one of the oncoming soldier's shoulders causing a blood curdling scream to erupt from his mouth. In doing all of this Hibiki had latched onto a now free falling knife and flung it blade first into the throat of his other assailant, the end result was a dying soldier that was gurgling blood as he fell to the ground clutching his throat.
<br />

<br />
Ramyra watched in both fascination and horror as Hibiki began to systematically dismantle the soldiers that attacked him. She had a rough idea of his limits, an also knew the only way he could be managing to avoid the mana bolts was that he had encountered them before. What bothered her was why Acidron hadn't used the weapon he had holstered on his back. It was obviously heavy and if that was so it probably had more power then the others.
<br />

<br />
"Hibiki, while you've been amusing now to say the least, your time is up.", with this said Acidron pulled his rifle from his back and leveled it at Hibiki.
<br />

<br />
In Hibiki's mind time began to slow down as a flash of bright light erupted from the rifles muzzle. Thankfully Hibiki had grabbed the nearest man to him and used him as a living shield. Even with this done though Hibiki soon found himself flying backwards through the air as he eventually came to a rather rough and sudden stop against the wall of a hut. The shock wave alone from the shot had wracked his body with pain, and needless to say the man he had used for a shield had been scorched black on the side the shot had impacted on.
<br />

<br />
"Very good Hibiki, I commend you on having some good reflexes. But surely having spent some time amongst these women there is one you care about right? All I really need that crystal you where carrying you know, you've become expendable. So what will you do to counter this?", Acidron was playing for keeps now as he turned the rifle towards the women.
<br />

<br />
Nothing was said as the rifle was set to its maximum setting. Of course when this happened four extra focusing rods sprang from the sides of the rifle as it gathered its charge. Acidron knew there was nothing Hibiki could do, no matter what he was going to die at his hands today. He knew that the runes on Hibiki's back where the reason he had only been using hand to hand combat. There was a brief bout of laughter from Acidron as he pulled the trigger on the rifle.
<br />

<br />
Hibiki, even for his disabling situation did the only thing he could now. He threw himself in front of the path of the rifle with his back towards Acidron. It was at that moment the runes on his back flared up to a brilliant blinding white light at the very second the mana charge collided with his body. The young man had made the ultimate sacrifice as the excess mana that his body couldn't absorb flowed around the make shift field that was placed around the amazons and then decimated the structures in its path.
<br />

<br />
There where more witnesses to this spectacle than anyone could have expected though. The very moment Hibiki had been struck a fiery arch had formed, and through it four figures had stepped forth. They had come to rescue Hibiki, but now it was to late as they watched his lifeless body fall to the ground. The Runes on his back that had cursed him had been partially burned away, though the ones that remained inhibited power, the ones that had been destroyed where those that held back his mind...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

Chapter 7
<br />

<br />
Fragments of a Shattered Soul, Echo's from the Abyss.
<br />

<br />

<br />
*Take note, in this chapter and all following ones there will be a *** marking where points of view change. This is simply to help people read and not get lost.*
<br />

<br />
Darkness was all around his very being now, as though he had fallen into a void. It was within this void that felt the presence of what could only be described as many people and yet none at all. It was all consuming as if it was trying to consume the very essence of his mind and soul. He did not know where he was; in fact his last memories had been that of stepping into a black tunnel. What he did know for certain was this, he wanted answers. The answers would not come easily though, this was the feeling he had as the veil of blackness congealed into an ever expanding room and his feet finally touched an apparent solid ground.
<br />

<br />
You must be Hibiki, a pleasure to meet you at last, this was the kind of voice that would surely have sent chills up anyone's spine.
<br />

<br />
Out of the abyss a lone figure finally came out to where Hibiki could see it. It was an elderly man, one who wore simple robes that somehow appropriately matched his withered aged face. His presence didnt startle Hibiki though the blackened empty eye sockets did, but that much this being knew was a good sign. It showed that he retained the same qualities that all his ancestors did. In fact it was the reason they had been the ones that carried the ability to awaken when the time was right so that they could act as defenders.
<br />

<br />
I want to know why I am here. Where is my Grandpa Cain, and why am I not in Kithicor Forest? Hibiki stood there, awaiting his answer without moving.
<br />

<br />
First we need to start from the beginning young one, I will start by telling you I am that which has no name. at this the elder man took a seat as a chair raised up from the onyx colored floor.
<br />

<br />
Everyone has a name, even the gods have names. So if you dont have a name then what am I to call you?, for the moment all Hibiki needed was something to call this creature before him.
<br />

<br />
You may call me Nameless if you wish. And now you wish to know what has happened to you correct? this brought a brief smile to the aged creatures face.
<br />

<br />
Hibiki simply sat down on the ground and crossed his legs. He realized that perhaps this could take awhile. There was a great many things that he wanted to know now. He wanted to know why it was that the government wanted him. Also he wanted to know what had happened to the rest of his family; this person here with him was perhaps the one who could tell him what he wanted to know.
<br />

<br />
You are called a Spirit Master, because your soul has become unique. You are perhaps more unique in that your one fourth celestial and one fourth demon. What you dont realize is that Zebuxoruk was the person who set your family on the path it has followed. It was he who took pity on the humans of Norrath long ago. In a sense it all started because of a fluke. The old man rubbed at his head as if troubled.
<br />

<br />
And what was this accident that caused everything to happen? Hibikis interests had been piqued now as he sat there watching the man before him.
<br />

<br />
A child was born that harbored two souls. It was this that I corrected when they both would have perished in the Greater Faydark forest. I had chosen them at that moment to be the ones to protect Norrath from the destructive will of all the deities who oversaw it. What I hadnt counted on was them being trapped just as Kerafym had been. Thankfully you escaped, though it appears you have not been without hardships. having said that there was a pause as the ghastly old man waited for Hibiki.
<br />

<br />
Being forced to constantly move throughout my life has been far more of a hardship than you could realize. at this Hibiki scowled.
<br />

<br />
Yes well this is what has happened to you. You where subdued and drained of your blood by what some people call Scientists. During that time your consciousness was suppressed by the use of runes tattooed upon the flesh of your back. If it was not for the creature Cyrus that Cain had created you surely would have died at that time six months ago. it was a grim thing to tell anyone, that much this man knew.
<br />

<br />
Indeed as one would expect Hibiki was shocked to believe that he hadnt had control of what he did for such a long time. There was more to the story now, this much he was certain of as his eyes began to focus. All his concentration was on the man before him and what he would have to say.
<br />

<br />
During that time you where on an island occupied with women. Each day Cyrus helped you escape being captured until at last you where caught. Dont worry they didnt get much of a chance to abuse you in your repressed condition. The same people that took your blood invaded the island and you did what any of your ancestors would have in the same situation. You sacrificed yourself to save the innocents. at this the elder man stood up from his chair.
<br />

<br />
So Ive died now and there is nothing I can do? Hibikis eyes fell to the floor as reality was starting to sink in.
<br />

<br />
You can return if you wish. After I have freed the memories in your subconscious and your other selfs agree to return. at that very moment the Nameless glided across to Hibiki and placed its hands on his head.
<br />

<br />
Just what do you mean by other selfs? needless to say this confused Hibiki.
<br />

<br />
Hibiki didnt get an answer as his mind was suddenly opened up fully by the figures touch. Long lost memories of his parents, grandparents, and great grandparents training together flooded his mind. Then there was a most disturbing vision of what he saw as he had devastated the fortress that hovered over the Ocean of Tears. All that paled in comparison at the next memory to come back to him, it was that of what Acidron had done to the amazons village. The one that lingered the most was that of when he was a child. This one held some sort of importance as it was the first time he stood up for someone else. He had stopped several children from picking on a girl, one that they had called a mixed blood.
<br />

<br />
Now you must convince the rest of yourself that you want to return.
<br />

<br />
With this said two other figured appeared before Hibiki, and he was for some reason afraid of them. One was a person covered in white clothing; even its face was covered as it stood there. The other was a grotesque creature that had a bone exoskeleton and teeth that glistened with salvia, its eyes where sunken in voids that had a crimson glow to them. What he could understand was that one was the perfect vision of a being that chose to be alone. The other was that of a savage creature that wished only for pain, death, and destruction.
<br />

<br />
We have to go back. Hibiki stood up as he confronted what he feared, hoping they would agree on this one thing.
<br />

<br />
We have no reason to go back. at that the being white attire turned away.
<br />

<br />
I would rather see them all dead an feast on their pain from this realm, theyre just sheep that we should feed upon. the beast simply turned its back to Hibiki just as the other had.
<br />

<br />
I will intervene on this occasion, I believe that you should return and I will show you why.
<br />

<br />
The Nameless waved one of its hands through the air and the blackness retreated to a scene deep within what looked like a jungle. As everything came into focus it was apparent that this was what was occurring on the island Hibiki had been on. The Nameless had decided to show them what was happening in the world just as it had shown Shoken and Ryo before.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Kei had went on the offensive the moment she had stepped out of the portal an saw Hibikis lifeless body strike the ground. She was wearing the amber necklace that had brought her to this island. Along with her had come Cain, Vexor, and Zebuxoruk which they too had rushed towards the remaining soldiers. Little could she have realized what she stepped into though as the women she seen scattered, all save for one that was being handed a whip.
<br />

<br />
It had been Ramyra that was handed the whip, she was going defend her people and avenge the Rune One who had fallen protecting them. The instant the leather weapon struck out it had wrapped firmly around the rifle that Acidron was holding. The tension she kept on the whip was keeping him from aiming it effectively enough to use it again.
<br />

<br />
During this Vexor and Zebuxoruk where handling the other soldiers as they both shoved the twins Lina and Rina out of the way of oncoming mana bolts. Normally they both would have been gawking at the scantly clad women, but both the ungod and the dark elf knew that they should keep their attention on the enemy. Cain in the meantime had been putting his mana to good use by reflecting the shots that came his way off in harmless directions. Thankfully even though he his age was against him he was still doing quiet well, particularly since the Exodus that was tucked under his belt was also lending its aid in slowing down the oncoming projectiles.
<br />

<br />
Ramyra on the other hand was not faring so well as a jolt of mana charged electricity flow across her whip. Acidron was well on his way to pointing his rifle directly at her only to be struck across the face at the last second by Kei. There was a brief electric hiss and then a flash from the rifles mussel. Acidron had still managed to pull the trigger. This time it would be another unlikely defender to take arms against the weapons destructive power, this time it was Zebuxoruk.
<br />

<br />
The ungod paid the price for this act as he fell to one knee. His body was now saturated in the mana as it coursed across his body; it even leapt from finger to finger during this. He knew full well before doing this that he had the ability to handle what this device could dish out, even if it did leave him somewhat incapacitated as an after effect. Still Zebuxoruk was quite surprised as he seen the fighting going on before him.
<br />

<br />
Kei had some previous knowledge of the weapon Acidron was using and she had put it to good use. It had a built in recharge delay unlike the other assault oriented rifles. In knowing this she had done the only thing she could, forcing Acidron to do hand to hand combat. She was confident that her opponent hadnt excelled any since the last time she had seen him. After all she was the best of her unit, or so she thought.
<br />

<br />
Youre going to pay for that you little bitch! having said this Acidron decided it was time to stop holding back.
<br />

<br />
Soon enough Kei discovered the error she had made. Extra emphasis was stressed to this fact as she found herself being propelled face first into the crumbling side of a hut. The first time her face met with the bricked wall it had dazed her, the second caused her world to nearly black out. A third did not come as she fell to the ground, her senses coming to her as she heard Acidron making a choking sound.
<br />

<br />
As her eyes finally cleared Kei discovered what had caused the abrupt halt of her pummeling. Ramyra had taken this opportunity to lash out with her whip an it doing so it became firmly wrapped around Acidrons neck in the process. Little prepared Ramyra for the surprise that awaiting her. The whip had given her foe just what he needed as she found herself at first tugged into the air, and then brutally struck across the stomach which resulted in her crumbling into a heap on the ground.
<br />

<br />
Cain immediately went into action as he seen an opening for an attack. The Exodus sword was clutched tightly within his hands, his knuckled turning white as a blade of pure crimson mana erupted from the hilt. Instantly a crash that echoed like thunder entered the air as the Exoduss blade came into contact with Acidrons forearm. There was an ethereal glow surrounding his arm, and at this moment Cain realized the mistake he had made. The rifle had been strong, but the user had to be that much stronger just to be able to hold it, let alone use it.
<br />

<br />
Out of the way old man!!! it was now Vexors turn to try his luck.
<br />

<br />
The young dark elf rushed past the two soldiers he had been fighting and leapt into the air. There was a glint of light at the end of his sword an then a thunderous clap as it came to a rest in Acidrons hand. Vexor had not meant to be successful in his attack at all; it had simply given Cain the time he needed to gain his distance.
<br />

<br />
Ill commend your courage on this young dark one, but it was a futile attempt. Acidron offered Vexor a vicious smile as he sent the dark elf reeling with a single punch.
<br />

<br />
The elder man had run out of options now as he now had some distance from this beast before him. There was one spell he had not used in a long time, and it was an all or nothing deal at that. This was as best time as any, that much Cain was certain of as a blinding white light flowed into his hands. Long ago he had used this against Xernoss and had feared ever having to use it again, but this time it was necessary, at least to buy some time in the least.
<br />

<br />
Dont do it Cain! Zebuxoruk did his best move his numbed body but it was useless.
<br />

<br />
This is for Hibiki, go back to the hell you came from! mana surged through Cains hands and finally erupted in a stream towards Acidron.
<br />

<br />
The Flesh Reaper had turned around just in time to be hit head on by the massive burst of white mana. Now he was on the receiving end of something he couldnt defend against as his body was suddenly forced into the darkness of the forest. Cain gave a brief smile at the same moment he heard an explosion from deep in the forest. It was then that the elder man fell to his knees, his body wracked with pain from expending such a force.
<br />

<br />
The battle wasnt over as Acidron had come storming back towards the village, his appearance having deteriorated to that of his previous state. He was a mass of rotting flesh that clung to bone that had a mouth of jagged teeth which dripped with foul saliva that carried the stench of death in it. This was the creature that haunted Keis nightmares ever since having survived Kithicor, and now it was back.
<br />

<br />
For this I will feast on your flesh, starting with you Kei. You I will eat alive for the pure joy of it!!! the flesh reapers teeth clicked together as he made his way towards his soon to be victim.
<br />

<br />
***
<br />

<br />
How can you, my own parts, watch this and not do anything?! Hibikis eyes took on an uneasy crimson tint as he turned to look at the two other shards of his soul.
<br />

<br />
The Nameless itself watched on at Hibikis reaction just now. What it had suspected was true then, this part of young man was the strongest and could very well become dominate. Still it also knew that the Celestial and Demonic halves would not bow so easily to anyone or anything. The two races had never given into the demands of a human, and the Nameless knew they would not do so willingly even if they where a part of one.
<br />

<br />
The woman is of no concern to me, her death would do much to please Me., the demonic creature just picked at its teeth with blackened claws while continuing to watch.
<br />

<br />
While I dont care much for humans, or even mixed blooded individuals at debt is owed to that woman. as unexpected as it was the Celestial agreed with Hibiki.
<br />

<br />
This was what the Nameless had waited to hear and it was at that very moment the Celestials form before Hibiki shifted to a pulsing white orb. Hibiki was in for the shocking experience at the sphere before him appeared to disperse into a cloud that instantly swirled up around his body before vanishing. Now he somehow felt more complete as he turned to the beast that still refused to joint him.
<br />

<br />
What of you now? Would you let them die knowing full well at Grandpa Cain took care of us for so long? You owe the same debt to Kei as well and you cant deny it. Hibikis eyes glared at the creature; waiting for its answer.
<br />

<br />
Of course the thing born of darkness before Hibiki had to at least acknowledge one thing. He was persistent now, and showed the properties that even most of the fiercest beings needed for survival. Hibiki, he now understood, was not willing to give up now in this dire time. This part of Hibiki refused to sway from its decision to reunite with him, even for all that it had witnessed, and after all it had no wish to help anyone because its main stable of sustenance was the darker emotions that people exhibited. This beast fed on pain, suffering, and hatred.
<br />

<br />
Thing would have never changed if it had not of been for the image that suddenly appeared before the demonic creature. It was Kei, completely defenseless as the Flesh Reaper called Acidron closed in on her. This part of Hibiki was in somewhat of an agreement with him now. This beast before it was a mockery of one of the many incarnations of demons known as Reapers. It was a group that took pride in causing pain and suffering, for they where warriors of the demons world. This was when a true agreement was settled upon by the demon; it would rejoin with Hibiki.
<br />

<br />
Understand this human; I go with you now before I wish to correct a disgrace upon our brethren. And with this a great row of dagger like teeth flashed before Hibikis eyes as the thing before him congealed into a blackened orb.
<br />

<br />
***
<br />

<br />
Keis world was beginning to fade into the darkness that she was certain would become her last living experience. She didnt have the strength now to move away as Acidron approached her. She could feel his footsteps vibrate through the earth beneath her. Now it was worse than the encounter she had in Kithcor. Kei could not only sense how close Acidron was to her, but now he was close enough for her to smell the stench of his rotting flesh.
<br />

<br />
The Amber colored jewel around Keis neck was clearly aware of the situation, yet it had no way to help her. It was not yet capable of altering its form beyond the present state it occupied. What it could do was sense its surroundings and now it was clearly able to detect its companion that so long ago shared a room with it. Then it was also aware of something else, it was sensing a mind. Whos ever mind it was it could not tell, but it was most definitely clued in on its surroundings. And then it felt as something was tearing through the very fabric of this plane, something was returning.
<br />

<br />
Take this you bastard! there was a loud crack that permeated through the surrounding area.
<br />

<br />
Keis eyes opened abruptly at the noise and she soon found the source of it. For a brief moment she though she had definitely passed on. Here was Hibiki standing on the ground just next to her feet, and from the looks of it he had given Acidron one hell of a blow, one that had sent him sprawling across the ground. Soon enough her nose filled with the smell of the Flesh Reapers festering blood and with that she knew full well she wasnt dead.
<br />

<br />
Hibiki had returned just in time to stop Acidron. He was now standing his ground, and it was apparent that something had changed about him. Ramyra, Rina, and Lina could all sense that something had changed. Even Cyrus was picking up on the fact that Hibiki had changed, and that perhaps a force that had once been held back was being released.
<br />

<br />
Ive seen what you are Acidron, and I know now what has happened to me. I also know what is going to happen to you now Hibiki said all this as his eyes remained locked on the Flesh Reaper before him.
<br />

<br />
Is that so? You do realize I killed you once before and I can do it again. I dont know how you came back, but Im certain you cant have but a few lives to spend here. Acidron simply stood up as he spoke.
<br />

<br />
I will show you now that I am not bluffing. You are not going to survive this in such a cheap way as you did in Kithcor. At having said this Hibikis eyes flared with a grey light.
<br />

<br />
Somehow, though none of the others present could explain it, the island had gone deathly quiet of all life. There was no longer the sound of exotic birds, or the chattering of small creatures. It was then that Hibikis hair went through a drastic change as the strands themselves began to shift to charcoal black with crimson highlights at the ends. The half destroyed runes on his back flared up at the exact same moment. This time however they could not hold back the power Hibiki was gathering in his body. The ground itself was beginning to shake, as the runes still attempted to hold back the power, this all being made evident by the hot electric bolts of mana that where flowing from the runes.
<br />

<br />
What few remaining soldiers that were left of Acidrons unit decided now was the perfect time to strike. A hail of mana bolts erupted from the rifles they carried, but instead of them striking Hibiki each shot curved around his body only to in turn hit what was on the other side of him. This was most definitely a mistake on their part as Hibiki held out a single hand, and it was then that the soldiers found themselves being used as some sort of sick perversion of Pinball. One went flying this way and another that way, their bodies making dull thuds as they bounced off trees, hut walls, and then finally the now dead bodies made their way towards Acidron.
<br />

<br />
Acidron did just what anyone would have suspected from someone thought themselves to be superior to others. He slapped each oncoming body to the side causing it to skid across the ground, and in the process he was left wide open for an attack. It was then that Hibiki went on the offensive; his form appeared to fade and come into view several times as he made his way towards Acidron. Finally Hibiki was airborne in front of his foe, forcefully ramming his knee into the creatures face.
<br />

<br />
The Flesh Reaper was, to say the least, astounded that Hibiki had managed to topple him so effortlessly. However, this feeling was soon replaced with pain as Acidron felt several well placed punches land square across his body. If it wouldnt have been for the fact he was already dead, Acidron would have surely been well on his way to the land of death as a final blow struck him directly across the side of his head. The attack had been a savage round kick that sent the undead fiend sideways, heading face first into the trunk of a rather bulky tree.
<br />

<br />
Hibiki wasnt finished though; he had instantly set about wrapping his hands with the tangled mess of hair that was on Acidrons head. Once this was accomplished he had began pound the creatures face into the tree over and over. In his mind Hibiki was counting silently as Acidrons face made gruesome bone splintering impacts, and finally upon the fifth strike the Flesh Reapers face plunged through the tree itself. 
<br />

<br />
You little bastard; Take this!!! Acidron span around as these words flowed from his stagnating mouth.
<br />

<br />
The fiend had managed to break free of Hibikis grasp, and had actually taken this chance to strike out with its clawed hand. All that Acidrons claws met was air; Hibiki had managed to slip by just in time. There was a quick grab, and then a grunt from the young man before Acidron found himself being flung over Hibikis shoulder by his arm. Then as expected there was an audible slap as the Flesh Reapers rotting carcass slammed into the ground.
<br />

<br />
Hibiki was done playing now as he suddenly flung the creature on the ground before him up into the air. He instantly began to travel upwards, as if going to pulverize Acidron with an exaggerated uppercut. At this very same moment the Flesh Reaper turned and lashed out at him with a small sphere of condensed mana. Much to Acidrons surprise Hibiki was no where in sight. It wasnt but a second later that he found out where Hibiki was; he felt a firm strike being planted into his back that sent him sailing down towards the cold hard earth below him.
<br />

<br />
Acidron didnt land though, Oh no that would be far to forgiving. Instead he found out just what how Hibiki had moved so fast as the shadows themselves beneath him opened up. Acidron gave out an rather gruesome and quite agonizing groan as a rising uppercut connected with his chin. Hibiki had somehow managed to use the darkness of the shadows to do his bidding and transport him around.
<br />

<br />
Zebuxoruk gave a slight smile as he watched the ongoing fight from a distance. He was watching Hibiki systematically tear Acidron apart by shifting through the shadows to land blow after crippling blow to the creature. The ungod knew full well this was but one of the many talents that demonic creatures had to aid them. Now he was wondering just what other knowledge Hibiki had come back to the land of the living with.
<br />

<br />
The Amazons leader was awestruck at the sight before her eyes now. Hibiki was going head to head against a fiend that not only she had failed to defeat, but the rest of her own warriors as well. Ramyra watched him for the longest time, her eyes training in on the bolts of mana that where surging across his body as he continued his assault on Acidron. This very phenomenon was something she had never witnessed before in any individual, in fact it should have been impossible.
<br />

<br />
Acidron on the other hand had been holding back something as a bit of a surprise. Hibiki soon found he was fighting not one Flesh Reaper, but three more as the bodies of some of the soldiers had risen to their feet. All signs of life had now been replaced by razor sharp teeth and claws, as well as a ethereal glow from their eyes. This was just one of the reasons Acidron had been sent to the island, even if his soldiers did die he could easily raise them from the dead to do his bidding.
<br />

<br />
Hibiki did well now to avoid these soldiers enhanced reflexes and speed. They where all moving around him much like that of a pack of wolves would, each taking a strike at him while the others would come at him from behind. Now he had no other choice but to fall back on his instincts, which told him to gain some sort of a weapon to retaliate with.
<br />

<br />
There was no warning or insinuation that anything had been planned, but nonetheless Hibiki found his world spinning as three fists crashed into his head from all angles.  The lesser Reapers had finally struck, and it wasnt but a second later that he found himself on the far opposite end of Acidrons rifle. The creatures freshly reanimated minions had given him the time he needed to reacquire his weapon and level it directly at Hibiki.
<br />

<br />
Cain watched on in horror as the weapon Acidron held abruptly let out its deadly load. The old man tore his eyes away from the scene as the mass of mana from the rifle rippled through the air, then struck home. All that Cain could hear was the sizzling of flesh and the crackling of mana which gave him no comfort what so ever at the outcome.
<br />

<br />
Unlike the time before Hibiki was alive, this much he knew as his body slid across the ground and came to a rest aside Rina, Lina, and what he could tell was a child that had hidden with them behind some debree. The three had taken refuge from the chaos, but instead it had found them. Hibiki could clearly see the fear in the childs eyes. Then he saw something more, as the girl held out a hand, and dangling from it was a emerald crystal.
<br />

<br />
Hibiki said nothing but instead gave a slight nod to the frightened girl. There was an unspoken understanding of sorts, where she knew he needed the crystal, and where he knew she needed him to use it to survive. Hibikis hand reached out as he heard Acidron striding towards him, he heard the metallic click of the rifle as it was being readied to fire again just as Cyrus fell into his palm
<br />
