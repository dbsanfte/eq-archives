Chapter 6
<br />

<br />
"Shadows from the Past, part 3."
<br />

<br />

<br />
Okay, it looks like its time for me to once again write a new chapter for the loyal readers. Anyway as some of you might know I've been posting some revisions to Shoken's Adventures. They would be located at "pub95.ezboard.com/bfantasystoriesforum". Now then I've added and clarified something's while doing the revisions that I've posted here so feel free to check it out. In any case since some people have been rude to me I've decided that they won't exactly be getting any help in EQ for awhile. Well anyway let the chaos reign supreme as I continue writing for all you loyal fans!!!
<br />

<br />

<br />
This weather was simply to intolerable a best for the weary traveler. He had heard it had been raining while on the boat, but hadn't actually given it much thought. In fact he was still wondering what his grandfather had to teach him since he had sent for him from his other grandparents. It was something he was use to though, every so often he would take the time to visit his grandparents on either side of the family.
<br />

<br />
Still he wondered just why his human grandfather was so odd at times, as if he was detached from what he was doing for a moment. The young man had to admit though that he was more like his grandfather than anyone would have thought. Sure redheads ran in both sides of his family tree, but the fact that his hair was nearly the color of blood is what made the majority of his family believe he took after his human grandfather.
<br />

<br />
Though he didn't like to think about it he was often taunted by most of the children where his family had lived on Faydwer because of his looks. Given his mother was a wood elf, and his father was half dark elf he should have looked more like an elf than anything else. Of course with this he hadn't exactly had an easy childhood, but then again his parents where kind and caring as where most of the adult neighbors they had. If anything it was comforting to know that they accepted him just as they accepted his father.
<br />

<br />
Nevertheless his mind was brought back to his surroundings as the boat finally stopped at the docks. At least he didn't have to worry about the ocean part of the trip anymore. He had to admit though it was kind of nice to travel by foot for once. Furthermore he had caught a glimpse of several rare creatures the voyage, which had managed to ebb his boredom somewhat.
<br />

<br />
Freeport was just as he remembered it, and he often enjoyed coming to visit his family here, especially his cousins. The fact that he had cousins just around his age was nice, it made things pass easier when he was a child on his visits here. He had as much fun as could be expected, what with the eldest of his cousins being male and all. It was quite fun just the same, even though the two younger ones where girls, though at times it was hard to understand them.
<br />

<br />
As the young man finally made his way from the docks he could only wonder just what his grandfather was going to teach him this time. The old man had always been so secretive in teaching him, and certainly refused to train him if anyone else besides his cousins where around. From what he could understand he was apparently being taught the family's secret fighting style that had been passed down several generations already.
<br />

<br />
The travelers mind raced as he thought of what was to come, though he was certain it was going to be surprising. Still he couldn't exactly let anyone he knew realize he was in the city, that was one of the many things that his grandfathers message has stated. As much as he loathed it he pulled his hooded cloak tighter around his body as went on his way, heeding his grandfathers wishes.
<br />

<br />

<br />
The young woman giggled as she watched the passengers get off the boat, in fact she had been waiting on it to arrive. In a way she was glad as she seen no one in particular disembark onto the docks. She just simply couldn't have her brothers ruining her fun so soon. It was far to enjoyable for her to torment the locals here while it was raining. All that remained for her now was to find someone to bother for awhile until she could find a better target. 
<br />

<br />
She couldn't decided on which one to choose, from all the men getting off the boat none of them really looked like any fun. For a moment she glanced around the crowd from the shadows, running a hand through her deep brown hair. Truthfully most of the men in this city would have given anything to send a night with her just for her looks, which is what she often used to torment them. Though the people before here didn't look at all interesting, then her baby brown eyes locked in on one who was trying to hide his appearance. The wisps of red hair she seen intrigued her, since she had never seen red hair with such an intense pigment to it.
<br />

<br />
With that it was settled, she had found the person she was going to bother for the night it seemed. She could tell by the way he moved he could probably give her hours of stalking enjoyment. There was also the fact that he was definitely heading somewhere urgent since he appeared to be avoiding almost all contact with people. That decided she simply pulled her lute from her side pack and started playing, the calm melody echoed through the night as the great game of hers began.
<br />

<br />

<br />
The young man knew he was being followed, though it was true he looked human he had senses that where far more heightened than one would expect. He could hear the music from a lute being played clearly, and he could even hear the footsteps of someone. This pretty much helped him understand that the person following him was of light weight, which probably meant they could of been a thief or something worse. He had something planned for such an occasion, which he was ready to put into action.
<br />

<br />
In his youth he had learned some of his fathers talents very easily, particularly ones that involved avoiding people. He knew his father had taken it far beyond what most people could since he could literally cling to walls or ceilings at will, and even move across them. This was something he had practiced with his fathers help, which made him excellent at hide and seek with the local children. So he decided it was time to play a game with this person, one which would cause them to come out into the open and  into clear view.
<br />

<br />
With a simple pivot of his foot he was heading down a darkened alley, and he knew that this had little hiding places for his follower. This was more of an advantage that one might think, since it was very possible to finding higher up and more out of the way places to conceal ones self. There was a smile on his face and then he was gone as he scurried up a wall and into the darkness the shadows provided.
<br />

<br />

<br />
She couldn't believe this had happened to her as she looked around the alley with no trace of the young man in sight. There wasn't even a single footprint past a certain point, and now it was clear to her he was much more than he appeared. Not once had anyone managed to lose her, yet this person obviously had, and left her dumbfounded at just how it was done.
<br />

<br />
"How can this be possible... Not once has anyone managed to leave me like this."
<br />

<br />
Needless to say she was confused as to just what happened, never before had she seen this in her life. It was like either he had disappeared or flew away. To her knowledge she knew that only certain people could cast levitate, but even then the use of mana would have been clearly visible. The same also applied to any kind of teleportation spell, and with the time and amount of concentration those take she surely would have caught up with him while he was casting it.
<br />

<br />
It was at this time she also decided to rule out the simple line of invisibility spells, not only could she see through them all. She knew that the rain would also make that idea useless, since the refraction of light would make any invisible form appear easily in plain sight. Still as she looked around she couldn't make out anything out of the ordinary, that is until her eyes seen a muddy footprint on a wall.
<br />

<br />
This was simply incredible to her, she had never ran into anyone who could literally walk across walls. The footprint alone was proof enough that whom ever this person was, they where definitely worth staying around for awhile. Anyone with this kind of talent could surely become a favorite for her to stalk, though she doubted it would be easy to hang onto this person when she finally met him face to face. She was going to need a plan to flush him out into the open.
<br />

<br />

<br />
It was a disgusting night for the middle-aged man as he walked down the water soaked street. After having been teased earlier by a certain young woman his night hadn't been going very well at all. In fact he had wasted so much time on this woman he was late for a meeting with Dismal Rage had been embarrassing, and down right disgraceful. It couldn't be helped now though, surely his superiors in Qeynos would reprimand him for this incident.
<br />

<br />
All he had known was being a Shadow Knight, which in his mind wasn't so bad since most people kept their distance. He should have known something was odd when the young woman openly started to converse with him in the bar. Nevertheless he had fallen for her beauty, then found himself rejected which now made matters worse. If he knew where she was at now he certainly would do his best to kill her, to both set his mind at ease, and to perhaps use her head to gain some favor with his superiors once he made it back home.
<br />

<br />
It was then that his eyes focused in on something to the side has he continued down the street, he recognized the cloths the figure was wearing easily. This was the same woman that had caused all this mess, and he took this as a sign from the gods that perhaps he could have a small amount of pleasure tonight. Whether it was her pain inflicted by his sword or something else, he was going to make sure that her blood flowed this night.
<br />

<br />
The rain proved to be a blessing in disguise as he moved through the shadows, with the steady flow of rain it became harder for anyone to hear his movements. He was dead set on spilling her blood as he crept up behind her. There was a flash of light as lightning and he could make out her breathing in that instance of illumination.
<br />

<br />

<br />
This was surprising to him, for once he seen a stalking actually being stalked by another person. Either she wasn't very bright, or she was concentrating more on finding him than on her surroundings. In any case she was now in considerably deep trouble. The situation was particularly hard for him to make a decision on.
<br />

<br />
He knew very well if he was to interfere that he might be found out, and knowing his grandfather, it would be disastrous. Though there was also the fact if he didn't act he would be letting a seemingly innocent person be harmed. This went not only against his parents teachings, but some of his grandfathers was well. Things never where easy for him, and it appeared as if nothing had really changed.
<br />

<br />
The young man's eyes narrowed in as the armored man behind the woman had begun to unsheathe his sword. It was to much for him to think about now, he just couldn't make a decision on what to do. If he helped her he could surely be found out by someone, and if he didn't help her she was most likely going to die. All he could do was let his instincts take over and guide his actions, it was all he had to rely on now.
<br />

<br />
The woman didn't even have time to see what hit her as she was shoved out of the way. Once her eyes focused in on just what was happening around her she realized just what had happened to her. She had been moved out of the way just an instance before a sword was about to cut her down. This was something she had never expected, the man from earlier that night had tracked her down. She could tell he had done all this just to seek revenge, which had been averted by the very person she was following.
<br />

<br />
"Takes a big man to attack someone from behind doesn't it?"
<br />

<br />
"I see she's found herself another man, this woman isn't worth it. She's just a tease."
<br />

<br />
"I'm just a bystander, but I won't let a woman be killed before my eyes like this."
<br />

<br />
"Such a foolish young man, you must obviously be one of the roaming paladins I've heard about here.", a slight smile crossed the man's face.
<br />

<br />
It was a certainty that he could easily finish off this young man before him. If anything his visit here had given him more information on the capabilities of the Paladins in this city. There was also the fact this one appeared to be unarmed, which was going to make his fight that much easier. None had been able to best him in swordsman ship from his guild.
<br />

<br />
A lightning bolt caused the sky to illuminate, that was all it took for the supposed fight to be over. The sword had cleaved deep into the young man's shoulder. Crimson stained the ground as he managed to pull himself from the blade. In this, the elder man took pride, particularly since the battle had seemingly ended with one quick strike. All that was now left was to finish him off and to go on about his business with the woman.
<br />

<br />
In the young woman's mind she came to the conclusion all her actions had caused this. It was her flirting with this man earlier that invoked his anger, in this she was certain. Not only that, but also she had stalked this younger man and intended to do the same to him. She realized that unless something was done the young man before her was surely going to die, and then she would most likely share his same fate.
<br />

<br />
"Your simply a child, so I'll finish you quickly. As for your little lady friend, I'll have some fun with her before she dies.", with that the man sheathed his sword and stretched out his armor clad hands before his enemy.
<br />

<br />
A gruesome smile came to his lips as streams of crimson mana began to flow through his arms. This was the an attack he truly took pleasure in performing. All that was left for him was to complete it, which he done so by pushing his hands forward. The result was a small mass of crimson tinted mana that flew through the air towards the young man with the intent of ending his life in an instant.
<br />

<br />
Before the young man's eyes he seen an act he had never actually witnessed in his life time as his would be stalker threw herself between the onslaught coming toward him. In a split second it was over, her body had absorbed the mana and she now lay motionless on the ground in front of him. He could clearly make out the damage she had taken as her body smoldered from the attack, it would of certainly been enough to kill him.
<br />

<br />
"What a shame that was, it doesn't really matter though. I can behead you just as easily."
<br />

<br />
"Have you no remorse, no compassion?"
<br />

<br />
"Compassion and remorse are for the weak, just like yourself."
<br />

<br />
"How.... How could you...", it was unbelievable that someone could be like this to him.
<br />

<br />
This was infuriating, in truth it was now pushing him beyond any limits he might have had as he struggled to stand. All he could do was cover the wound on his shoulder tightly as his teeth clenched down and ground against each other. For the moment he was wishing for anything to help him overcome this man before him, anything at all that could stop him from doing what he wanted now. Unbeknownst to him, his hopes and his wishes where going to come true.
<br />

<br />
"So you still think you can fight me with that injury you have. Your nothing but a boy pretending to be a man.", this was a mistake that the aged Shadow Knight would never have a chance to repeat.
<br />

<br />
The young man before him was now fully enraged, and with that fury came the strength he was wishing for. The rain itself was suddenly being forced back away for his body in the shape of a sphere in which he was the very center. Soon the hardened stone walls in the alley came into contact with this unknown force and where being pushed back as well.
<br />

<br />
"My name is Damon, an your going to pay for what you've done tonight!", at that he leapt forward, driving a foot into the elder man's face.
<br />

<br />
It was all he could do to unsheathe his sword as he avoided a fist that was coming for his face. In his mind he thought surely he couldn't have underestimated this young man called Damon before him. Though not it appeared as if he did as he lashed out with his sword, trying to strike him before another attack could be launched at him.
<br />

<br />
This was all in vane though as Damon once again struck out, this time his fist came in contact with his opponents breastplate, causing it to bend and finally crack under the force exerted on it. He was like a man possessed now, all he wished for was the death of this person before him. This person who had not only hurt him, but had also hurt an innocent woman.
<br />

<br />
During all of this the woman had began to come to her senses, she had heard the name of the man who had tried to protect her. As her eyes came into force she seen the two once again fighting, this time things where very different from before. It was clear Damon was now winning as he flung their attacker into a wall, which in turn caused the armor clad man to leave an imprint behind as he fell to one knee.
<br />

<br />
"This is far from over boy, I promise you that much.", at that the man was surrounded by mist as he vanished from sight.
<br />

<br />
All this proved to do was anger Damon even more so as he struck the stone wall before him with one of his fists. He was like an savage animal out of control now, he wanted to do nothing but take his anger out on anything around him. It was then that his eyes found something to focus his anger on, the young woman who had now become conscious and was sitting up.
<br />

<br />
"Your the cause of all this! Whom ever you are, your going to pay for this!"
<br />

<br />
"My name is Elizabeth, and I'm terribly sorry for all of this. Honestly."
<br />

<br />
Another flash of lightning brightened the area for an instant, and then Elizabeth found herself in a choke hold as her back was being pulled up against Damon's chest. She couldn't understand why this was happening to her. The only conclusion her now oxygen deprived mind could come to was that he had went completely insane. She realized that the only way she could escape from this would be to reveal something that only her family knew about.
<br />

<br />
It didn't take long for him to release her from his hold, especially since he now found her mouth tightly clamped down on his arm. She had bit him, and in reaction he had released her, never before had any kind of bite hurt so much. He soon realized just why though as he backed away for a moment and stared at her face. Now he understood, she had fangs and they had sank nearly to the bone when she bit him.
<br />

<br />
"Damon stop this right now!"
<br />

<br />
As he turned to the familiar voice he found a hand come down across his face, which sent him to stumbling to his knee's. The person who had struck him was his grandfather, and it was clear he wasn't happy having seen all that had happened. This all had a somewhat sobering effect on Damon as his mind began to calm back down from its frenzied state.
<br />

<br />
"As for you woman, unless you wish the same you'll accompany us to our home. If you refuse you'll be taken by force."
<br />

<br />
Elizabeth definitely wasn't going to refuse this, mostly because she was afraid of what he could do to her. If this person could clearly make Damon become so calm simply by becoming angry then it surely meant he was far more powerful than he appeared. She was curious though, as to just who these people where.
<br />

<br />
It didn't take long for Damon to fall into step behind his grandfather, he could tell he was angry. Further more he could tell they where heading for his cousins home. He felt awful for what had happened, it was clear to him that he had lost control, something that his grandfather had warned him about many times. All he knew for certain was he was likely to be punished once they where inside and out of sight.
<br />

<br />
"Apologize to the lady here Damon, or else you'll meet a far worse punishment than your thinking of now."
<br />

<br />
"I'm sorry Miss..."
<br />

<br />
This all seemed very odd to her, mostly because he didn't try to argue, and also the fact that this aged man seemed to be taking her side. She could tell the two where related just by looks, though she could sense the old man was hiding something. Though she couldn't imagine what it could be at the moment, she was sure she'd find out soon though as they stopped in front of a house.
<br />

<br />
Inside she could hear a woman scream out a few words of anger, though it was muffled enough to make what was said incomprehensible. It was then that she sensed something she had been trying to avoid all along in this city. She could tell both of her brothers where very close, though she had no idea where they could be. Little did she realize she was just about to find out...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

Chapter 7
<br />

<br />
"Shadows Converge."
<br />

<br />
If all goes well chapter 8 will also soon follow this, if anything people should enjoy this and the next chapter. My lack of writing is due to the fact I've been revising my earlier works and have been posting those works on another site. If anything this is helping me develop the plots better, as well as intertwining past events and there effects on the future events this story is about.
<br />

<br />

<br />
This was the last thing he needed, not only had he not wanted to watch over his two grandnieces, he absolutely detested what had happened this night. In order to keep everything quiet he had told his grandson to arrive unnoticed, instead things had gone all amiss. Furthermore he was now having to deal with the situation before him, of three others he held a great deal of contempt for, mostly because of who their father was.
<br />

<br />
"Kiri, how many times did our parents say never to bring men home?"
<br />

<br />
"Look who's talking, what about him?"
<br />

<br />
"I was more or less forced to come here. It's not my fault she had this thing for wanting to beat me senseless."
<br />

<br />
At hearing that Rina stood up straight and dropped Ash to the floor as if he where dead weight. It was clear things weren't exactly going over smooth like one would expect. Also there was the fact that these two where at least part vampire, which they knew didn't settle to well with their great uncle. This was becoming one big mess, one that was going to surely become worse.
<br />

<br />
"Everyone just shut up now!"
<br />

<br />
"But it's her...."
<br />

<br />
"I said shut up! I never wanted to baby-sit any of you, and the fact that their here doesn't help matters. If you worried about me finding out or knowing they are some kind of vampires I already know that."
<br />

<br />
This was surprising to everyone in the room, most especially to the ones he was talking about. They had all thought they could hide themselves from anyone, no matter how acquit their senses where. All this did was to further confuse everyone in the room, save for the old man.
<br />

<br />
"I might be old, but I'm certainly not stupid. I know that your father had several children after he was resurrected, though I never imagined I would meet them. However, since you pose no threat, or have proven yourselves before my eyes you won't be destroyed here and now."
<br />

<br />
"I doubt  you could do that no one is.....", before Ash could say another word he was proven wrong.
<br />

<br />
It wasn't the fact that he didn't believe anyone could be that strong, it was the fact that he didn't believe anyone could move fast enough. Though now he realized this was all an illusion as he found himself being lifted into the air by his shirt. He now knew this old man wasn't all he appeared to be, this much was for certain now.
<br />

<br />
"My name is Ryo, an I fought your father. In fact I've grown much stronger since then, so it is best you don't try to anger me again.", with that he dropped Ash to the floor.
<br />

<br />
Alexander had always known his father was strong, but never fully realized how someone could defeat him. Now he knew why, and furthermore he was at the mercy of one of the few people who could destroy him at a whim. If anything at least he knew where his brother and sister now where, which where going to make things easier for him once this was over.
<br />

<br />
"Now since it seems your all going to be guests here for awhile... I want your names as I'm sure we're most likely going to be on a first name basis from now on. As for the argument about who's in trouble, I'm taking full responsibility for this all."
<br />

<br />
"Well Sir, my name is Alexander."
<br />

<br />
"I'm called Ash", all he could do was wave up from his place on the floor, he was to tired to stand for the moment."
<br />

<br />
"My name is Elizabeth..."
<br />

<br />
She was amazed that all this had happened, yet she was also confused as to just why Damon was being so quiet. More so confusing was how her brothers had come to be here in this house with these women. If anything it was odd for her to see her brother Ash so well behaved now, but she knew things where best that he kept on friendly terms with this man called Ryo.
<br />

<br />
"As you will notice the two girls who where fighting like children are called Kiri and Rina. The quiet one here is called Damon."
<br />

<br />
All he could do was glance at the others when his name was mentioned. He felt horrible after what had happened earlier. Long ago his grandfather told him that losing control of a situation would have dire results, now he was realizing just how true those words where. If his grandfather hadn't stopped him he would have surely killed Elizabeth in his rage.
<br />

<br />
"Feel free to rest while your all here. Damon your training will begin in the morning, I suggest you get the bite on your arm looked at. As for you Rina, I'll teach you some more rules about combat tomorrow since it's become blatantly obvious you show no discretion or forethought when fighting."
<br />

<br />
With all that said Ryo simply left them to their own thoughts, as well as anything he had to do. He knew the three he had left there would not harm anyone there. It was sort of an latent ability he had gained through the passage of time. If anything they would be of more help to his family than a hindrance now.
<br />

<br />
"Looks like your in trouble again Rina, what did you do this time?"
<br />

<br />
"What happened certainly wasn't my fault, you have to understand that.", Rina knew full well this wasn't true, if anything it was a bluff at best.
<br />

<br />
"I think what he was talking about was the fact that she nearly killed me on accident with some sort of attack.", Ash hadn't taken the time to even sit up, it was far less painful for him to remain on the floor.
<br />

<br />
"How was I to know you are what you are?!"
<br />

<br />
"I'm surprised anyone was able to hit him, normally he does so well at running away and avoiding such things."
<br />

<br />
"I couldn't avoid it, whatever it was homed in on me...", Ash still couldn't shake the feeling the attack had left him with.
<br />

<br />
"Well of course it would idiot, that's just how Soul Reactance works."
<br />

<br />
"Soul Reactance, a technique that frees the souls of the undead so that they can enact vengeance upon other undead.", this was something Damon knew all to well.
<br />

<br />
In fact Damon had seen this particular technique used by his own father. If anything it was far more unique than anything else he had seen. This was something he began to wonder about, most especially since his grandfather had mention he would eventually learn some of the most secret of family arts.
<br />

<br />
It wasn't odd for Kiri or Rina to see Damon from time to time. They knew he tended to be quiet and withdrawn for the most part. One thing they had noticed was that he tended to avoid women in general. If anything this only made them pay more attention to him, which to them didn't seem like something he wanted.
<br />

<br />
"As for you, I'm not finished with you yet!", Rina glared down at Ash.
<br />

<br />
"No fighting in the house! You remember what happened the last time you and Magus fought right?"
<br />

<br />
"How could I forget, I wonder how he's doing anyway with grandpa training him.", this only proved to stir Rina's thoughts now.
<br />

<br />
This much was for certain, Rina and Magus had never seen eye to eye on most things. The constant fighting had finally came to the point where they had to be separated. This in turn only made her go out and begin bar room brawls. The way her parents seen this is that at least it wasn't their house that was getting destroyed, and at least she was keeping the usual low lives on their toes.
<br />

<br />
"Well I would imagine that our brother is probably much better at fighting than you are by now."
<br />

<br />
"As if, sure he had the strength, but he'll always be slow."
<br />

<br />
To say that this was surprising to Elizabeth was an understatement. She had never seen a woman who was so wrapped up in fighting. In fact she seemed to be worse than some of the barbarians she had came across in the town earlier that night. However, her attention was soon brought back to Damon.
<br />

<br />
All the while that they had been talking he had been quietly tending to the bite mark on his arm. Damon took little pleasure in this, since he tried his best to avoid being injured. This mostly had to deal with the fact that the clerics from back home would have given anything to get their hands on him. That was something he just wouldn't allow, since if anything he figured they would cause him more harm than good.
<br />

<br />
"You could of at least let me do that, since I did cause it."
<br />

<br />
"I'd rather do things like this myself if you don't mind."
<br />

<br />
"You know Alex, I'd have to say this is the first time anyone's actually gave Becky the cold shoulder."
<br />

<br />
"I do believe your right Ash."
<br />

<br />
Sure enough, both of Elizabeth's brothers began to laugh, which wasn't the wisest of all things to do. For his part in this Alex found himself ushered back into Kiri's room. Needless to say Ash found himself being handled like a rag doll as Rina shoved him into another room. This in turn left Damon and Elizabeth by themselves, which was something he would have rather avoided.
<br />

<br />
"I almost feel sorry for those two, the one will be pampered to death, and the other could be beaten to death."
<br />

<br />
"So why are you so withdrawn anyway? It's something I've been dying to ask you about.", a look of curiosity came across Elizabeth's face as she finally began to study him.
<br />

<br />
In her opinion there shouldn't of really been a reason for Damon to act the way he did. After all he was fairly handsome, and considering what happened earlier he had to of been well built. This was all a big puzzle to her now. It was obvious that there was some reason that he chose to be withdrawn, and now she was determined to find out just what it was.
<br />

<br />
"I suppose the best explanation is that I'd prefer to be left alone."
<br />

<br />
Elizabeth didn't get a chance to reply though as she heard her brother Ash being tormented. Apparently Rina as making good on her promise of getting even with him, though not exactly in the way anyone expected. She definitely had some strange tendencies, this one being one of the stranger ones.
<br />

<br />
"Let go!!! Stop with the pulling!!!"
<br />

<br />
"Quit your whining! It's not that bad, besides I want you to be at full strength when I grind you into the dirt!"
<br />

<br />
"Somebody get this mad woman off me!"
<br />

<br />
Ash made what could be described as a valiant attempt to wedge himself out the door of the room. Of course Rina would have none of this and quickly jerked him back inside and slammed the door shut. At seeing this a slight smile crossed Damon's face, and a small giggle escaped Elizabeth's lips.
<br />

<br />

<br />
If anything all Ryo could do on his walk home was wonder just what was coming in the near future. The feelings he had gotten as well as the recent news he had heard of disturbed him. It was becoming apparent that someone of great power as beginning to set into motion a plan.
<br />

<br />
He wasn't to fond of dealing with such things, if anything he disliked it more than dealing with his great nieces. At least he had gotten encouraging news that Magus's training was entering the near final stages for the up coming tournament. This was something he would definitely enjoy seeing.
<br />

<br />
It wasn't often he got to see a good fight these days, what with the world having calmed down somewhat. This tournament was going to be one that he'd do anything to get to see. Besides he had his own plans for getting Damon to enter. If anything he wanted to see just how far his own grandson could advance.
<br />

<br />
What was beginning to complicate matters where the fact that far more people where intending to enter the upcoming fight than ever before. This meant he was going to have to show Damon some special techniques that he'd be saving for just such an occasion. Furthermore he knew that Magus was going to be able to put up one hell of a fight.
<br />

<br />
Ryo had noticed that even at an early age that Magus had a talent the likes of which he hadn't seen before. What was odd was the fact that he always seemed to hold back, no matter the situation. This was something he simply couldn't understand, but perhaps it was for the best for him to do such rather than have to face the consequences that both he and Shoken had experienced.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Deep inside the Mistmoore Castle things where not going as Mayong would have liked. No one had been able to bring his children back home, no matter who it was. He was now being forced to use his last resort. Long ago things had been arranged and now he wasn't going to allow the whims of his foolish children to disturb everything.
<br />

<br />
"Since you three are betrothed to my children it is up to you to return them here. Failure will result in your deaths."
<br />

<br />
The people to which he spoke knew all to well this was more of a promise than a threat. None of them wanted to lose the chance at the kind of power they would gain through marriage. This meant they where going to be intent on facing whomever stood in their way, no matter who or what they where.
<br />

<br />
Mayong silently cursed to himself of how his children where. They had ended up with his stubbornness save for their mothers compassion. This was what truly had him angered, since it was obvious they where going to fight the arrangements anyway they could. Their escape from the castle as well as them having avoided most of the contact with his spies is what had really gotten to him.
<br />

<br />
It didn't matter though he knew just where they where going. Mayong knew they where going to head to Freeport and use the Tournament to hide in. He also knew that some of his old enemies where going to be in that very same city. The worst possible thing he could imagine would be his own children hiding out with the same people responsible for his death.
<br />

<br />
Though most disturbing to the great vampire was the fact he felt an old familiar presence of evil beginning to build again. He knew all to well who this was, and hated this person for the way he had been used by them. If anything they where more responsible for his death than the people who carried the Kataoka family name.
<br />

<br />
This was by far the worst thing he expected, since he was now going to need every shred of power he could muster to at least ensure his own survival as well as his families survival. He wasn't about to let anyone ruin what he had managed to rebuild over the years. All Mayong now wished for was not to take control of the Faydwer continent, but to simply see his family grow and be safe.
<br />

<br />
If anything this was something none of his past enemies would have suspected. In fact it was harder for him to believe it himself. Nonetheless this was something he wanted now, and he was determined to have it at any cost. This meant he was going to use his full power that he had just recently managed to regain to ensure that everything he wanted came to be.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

Chapter 8
<br />

<br />
"Cyrus Awakens."
<br />

<br />
Since most people seem to be wondering what has occurred, your going to find out in this chapter. The worse case scenario is about to happen, further more an old Foe will appear. In any case as I'm writing this I have a cold, so bear with me. I feel like something the cat dragged in...
<br />

<br />

<br />
Magus stood before several of the judges who where about to pass sentence on him. After the incident the night before he had been worried only about Kayla. Though before he had entered the court room his worries where put to rest as she had only been sedated with a power drug the assassin had used. This did little to ease his troubled mind though, he was afraid of what he had become when angered. It was the unbridled force that was guiding his actions that he feared more than anything else.
<br />

<br />
All he could do was thumb the small crystal charm he had given him before sending him just after he had entered the room. Everyone had been silent as several of the judges conversed about the events that had happened. There was no possible way now that his family could persuade the decision that was about to be made.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Cain cursed himself for having brought all this on his great grandson, in fact he felt he was worse than a murderer now as he sat in the room. He knew the boy was probably going to be sentenced to imprisonment or death. In truth he had given him the Cyrus in hopes that it could protect him from everything, and perhaps demonstrate his true persona. For all the years that he had watched this child grow up he had always seen he was withdrawn at times, but never would he willingly try to take an innocent persons life.
<br />

<br />
If anything his hopes laid with the Cyrus, the crystalline entity that he had fashioned to become the ultimate protector. Though he realized the cost using the components assembled to create it could cause. Through all the years he had taken the chances to collect samples of creatures only know as Celestials, as well as their near opposites known roughly as Demons. The other part that had in fact made it a crystal was a fragment of armor from the being only know as the Dread King.
<br />

<br />
The combination proved to be deadly indeed, over the years he had managed to keep this experiment under-wraps. Al'Kabor himself would have raised quite a stink if he had known what Cain had been attempting to do. It was by pure luck that Cyrus had not awakened yet, though it was also by pure luck that it had remained in a perfect neutral state. This was a good sign, since it was neither considered of a good nor malevolent nature.
<br />

<br />
Cain realized that in his youth he had indeed done something great, he was responsible for the Exodus being created. In turn it had reproduced itself to create a counterpart for itself, that called the Lumina. Several other weapons had thus spawned from the Exodus, the last having been the Matsume. If anything the Matsume was a great weapon, but he feared that soon it would not be enough.
<br />

<br />
This was one of the main reasons he had passed the Cyrus crystal off to Magus. He wanted the boy to be saved, and also he had a gut feeling that somehow it would awaken only his possession. He had a rough idea that it would take on the form of an armor, but didn't have much else he could go on. It's potential was considerably higher than that of anything he had created in the past.
<br />

<br />

<br />
This was the perfect time for him to enact his revenge. Years before he had managed to gain the powers of several demonic creatures, yet this didn't satisfy his lust for power. He wanted the power of the one who was neither Celestial, nor Demon. Just recently he had found the documents on such a creature, and had learned it had been sealed away.
<br />

<br />
At first his plan was simple, he had hired an assassin to kill off the Bayle family. These were not the only targets though, he had also instructed the assassin to kill the descendants of those who had opposed him. He knew full well that they could stand against him and prevent him from gaining the goal he had set.
<br />

<br />
This goal was simple, he wanted to not only rule the entire mortal realm of Norrath, but he also wished to rule over all the other alter planes he had traveled to. In order to do this he knew he was going to have to gain enough power to rival the gods themselves. This alone had lead him to search out the more powerful of non-deity creatures. The closest match to anyone with this kind of power had come to several choices for which he could try to mimic.
<br />

<br />
The first of these prospects where the man simply known as Raziel Eo'brm, but after a certain point there where no traces of him to be found. One of the next choices seemed to be those of the True Dragon's, though finding them had proved to be more difficult than that of Raziel. The last choice that had caught his eye was that of Dirk Lunas, though this man was no where to be found the fact that he was half demon was the inspiration he needed.
<br />

<br />
After having researched all this he finally came across more valuable information still. It pertained to a race of beings simply called Celestials. These people where very nomadic, and it was becoming more difficult to even find anyone of this race now. All this changed after having found that a half demon, half celestial person had been sealed up long ago near Qeynos.
<br />

<br />
With all this knowledge he had attained he realized that if someone where to either become like this person was that they could conquer anything they wished to. This was his ultimate goal, he wanted to use this power to destroy everything in existence. The theory was if he could destroy the gods, then he had enough power to access the core of all creation without having to gain the keys the gods possessed. There he could manipulate what he wished to and recreate everything just the way he wished it to be.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Since the fiasco in Freeport he had little time to rest. Even for a Shadow Knight his age this punishment was rough. It was risky, and most certainly meant death if anything didn't go his way. This was somewhat expected, though he never imagined he would be used in such a way.
<br />

<br />
The nature of his job was simple enough he though, and considering his training he could accomplish the task at hand. All he had to do was break into the court room and destroy the judges as well as anyone present. The information he was given was that these people where responsible for one of their best assassins being caught.
<br />

<br />
One other thing bothered him though, he was suppose to kidnap a woman being taken care of no far from the court room. This was by far something new to him, normally he was just sent out to torture and kill any victims, so this was a definite change from the routine. All he was told about her was that she was special, and that one of their associates wanted the girl for some sort of experiment.
<br />

<br />
After learning this he simple thought it was more likely the Erudites of Paineel, or perhaps the Necromancers located in Neriak. He had always heard they where of the experimenting type, this didn't surprise him one bit. Both the Dark Elves and the aforementioned Erudites had always had a thing for performing experiments. The part that was puzzling is that the rumor was it wasn't going to pertain to necromancy.
<br />

<br />
It was a breeze for him to slip into the building and around the guards. They never where to bright when it came to dealing with Necromancers or Shadow Knights. In all their efforts to rid the Aqueducts of their presence they had always failed. For the most part this was due to incompetence of the Qeynos guards, as well as the fact that they used the night and shadows to do their bidding.
<br />

<br />
All was quiet looking in the room from his vantage point. It all seemed quiet as the judges appeared to be deliberating some verdict for the young man he seen standing before them. He had heard this boy had something to do with several incidents that had marred the reputation of the guards, as well as the Bayle's family name. If it wasn't for the fact this youngster had captured their assassin he might have been invited to join them.
<br />

<br />

<br />
The judges definitely had their hands full on this one. None of them where sure just what had happened considering how the guards all seemed to hate this man before them. Furthermore the fact he had been found in the company of an assassin didn't make matters easier. If they made the wrong mistake it surely could return to haunt them another day.
<br />

<br />
"It's unanimous then, given the information and the first hand accounts we have no other choice but to pass this sentence."
<br />

<br />
"We the judges of Qeynos have found Magus Kataoka guilty on all charges."
<br />

<br />
"Having decided this the sentence is immediate execution...", this was indeed grim for them to condemn such a young person to this fate.
<br />

<br />
"D... D..... Death?", Magus couldn't believe what he heard.
<br />

<br />
This all felt like it was some hellish nightmare to him. He couldn't understand how they could do this, it just didn't seem right at all. If it wouldn't have been for him the young lady Bayle would have died for sure. Not only that, but the whole Bayle family could have been destroyed afterwards with ease.
<br />

<br />
Odd as it might have been, Cyrus could comprehend all that was going on. It relied on its feelings and primitive thoughts. It could tell the person who was now in possession of it was facing some sort of crisis. At the time though it deemed it to not be life threatening, if it was to become worse that would certainly trigger a response from it.
<br />

<br />
There was a flash of light, and then Magus felt intense pain as he was flung across the room. Out of the corner of his eye he could seen an armor clad figure batting down the guards with a bastard sword as they tried to restrain him. Who ever this was had apparently come here to finish the work that the man last night had failed to.
<br />

<br />

<br />
It was incredible, who or whatever had given him this power had definitely earned his graces and his servitude. This was far more strength than he had even at his best, he could literally feel his muscles straining against the armor he was wearing. He was going to make sure he pleased who ever had granted him this power no matter what it cost, even if it meant killing off his old masters and allies.
<br />

<br />
These guards where nothing to him, and the focus of his first assault was laying across the room motionless. The guards where no more than gnats to him now as he struck them down one by one. He was thoroughly enjoying this new found gift, and the carnage he was capable of producing now.
<br />

<br />
It felt as if nothing could stand in his way, almost as if he were nothing but the pure essence of evil itself. He had wanted this kind of strength for years, and now he had it. Not only was he going to put it to good use now, but later he planned on returning to Freeport to take revenge on the people there.
<br />

<br />

<br />
This was all upsetting to the being most would call an ungod. For years he had watched over these people and watched them overcome their troubles. Now though things where different, he didn't have the power to physically help them anymore. Their mutual foe had now gained far more power than he had managed to attain before.
<br />

<br />
The options that now lay before him where limited. If he tried to physically help now he could be exposed and killed. Zebuxoruk did know one thing, that the old man Cain had invented something that could save them now. Though it was apparent both the young man in the scene and the entity he was in the possession of could defeat this man. They simply didn't have the motivation.
<br />

<br />
An idea came to the great beings mind, and it was indeed a wonderful one. The sword he had seen the night before could most likely arouse the young man's mind. If that was possible then perhaps things stood a chance of changing now.
<br />

<br />

<br />
The Matsume couldn't understand what was going on now since it had been separated from Magus the night before. More so disorientating was how it had suddenly found itself transported into one of its masters hands. Everything seemed so grim and it could tell that all hope had apparently been sucked out of Magus.
<br />

<br />
- Get up you idiot, come on lets get up and kick this guys arse! -
<br />

<br />
- Leave me alone, even if I do I've been sentenced to death... They'll kill me afterwards. -
<br />

<br />
- Come on, if you don't get up you'll die anyway, there's always a chance you can change their minds. -
<br />

<br />
- It's no use, I'll sleep till death takes me... -, at that Magus closed his eyes, tired of the conversation.
<br />

<br />
"Marvelous power, this is splendid, now for the woman from last night!"
<br />

<br />
- Did you hear that Magus, he's going to go after Kayla! -
<br />

<br />
Something inside of him couldn't stand the thought of anyone harming Kayla. If he was going to die then so be it, but he couldn't die knowing she could join him soon afterward. It was true that his body hurt, and that he should have stayed down, but the intense need to protect the people he cared was now making him stand.
<br />

<br />
Magus leapt forward before his enemy had a chance to see him standing, a brilliant light filled the room as the Matsume's emerald materialized. With several strikes the assailant found himself stumbling as he turned to face who was left for him to fight. Much to his surprise it was the very person he thought wouldn't give him anymore trouble.
<br />

<br />
"That was a big mistake, you'll never see the executioner!"
<br />

<br />
Once again he felt disoriented as he was struck across the face with an armor encased fist. The ethereal blade of the Matsume had only managed to scar the mans armor at best. There was a hard cold feeling as he fell to the ground, blood was freely pouring from his mouth. Magus could feel his mind beginning to slip into unconsciousness, and there was nothing he could do about it now.
<br />

<br />
It was then that Cyrus came to the conclusion that its existence was in trouble. The young man who was in possession of it surely faced death. It felt that for some reason this person was the one it was going to bond to. All it could understand was is that this person needed help, and also the strength to fight.
<br />

<br />
Cyrus only knew of one way to help this person now, it had determined that he would need some sort of armor. After all he already had a weapon, which it determined was quite unique, and would assist it easily in helping defend them both. With this settled it pulled Magus's broken body up into the air as an orb of spectacular white light engulfed his body.
<br />

<br />
All that Magus felt now was a bone chilling coldness inside his body, but at the same time he was also experiencing a burning sensation on his skin. What ever was happening to him now was feeling worse than any torture imaginable. All of his senses where being overwhelmed now as they where being pushed far beyond their limits.
<br />

<br />
Though the guards where conscious and able to see what was happening before them they hadn't a clue what was going on. They couldn't tell what kind of spell was now encompassing the young man that was sentenced to death. This light was far more intense than any they had ever seen from a spell before as even the shadows of the room began to retreat from the light.
<br />

<br />
At last the brilliant light began to retreat, almost as if it was being pulled into something. Before everyone's eyes a  figure began to take form out of this seemingly chaotic display of power. Little did anyone know that what they where about to see would be something to both be feared, as well to be cherished at the same time.
<br />

<br />
Finally the ebbing light vanished and the figure that now stood before them baffled the guards, as well as their foe. The armor was seamless, it being mostly silver all except the crimson patches on the shoulders as well as the chest. The chest plate was separated, one plate covering each breast. The same applied to the abdominal section, these appeared to be the only actual separations in the armor.
<br />

<br />
The head was a different matter completely, again no openings where present, even the mouth was covered tightly. It was magnificent to behold, yet frightful as well, mainly due to the where eyes should have been was simply what appeared to be a crystalline visor that ran from temple to temple. Also more disturbing where the hands, as each finger appeared to come to a semi-dull point, as if they where malformed claws.
<br />

<br />
Magus was now aware that the pain had subsided, even the pain from his wounds was gone. It took awhile for his eyes to adjust, but once they did they locked in on the armor clad man before him. He surprisingly now felt angry, even more so than he was before, little did he know that Cyrus was using this emotion for its own purpose. In fact it was amplifying it many times over, using it to focus Magus's attentions on the threat to their lives.
<br />

<br />
It soon became apparent to the guards that a tremendous battle was about to take place. They came to this conclusion as they seen the newly armored young man rush forward and strike their foe. This in turn sent the elder man before them crashing through the wall, the tables had now turned.
<br />

<br />
This was impossible for him to understand, how could simply gaining some strange armor as this cause such a miraculous change in strength. He couldn't understand it, even now as he swung his bastard sword in his attempts to strike down this thing before him. No matter how hard he tried, his sword constantly missed it's target.
<br />

<br />
All this didn't seem strange to Magus at all now, he was simply doing what his grandfather had trained him to do. Now that he had seen everything this man could do, it was time for him to act on that. This having been decided he struck the man once more, his fist landing clean across the his breastplate and causing it to fold around his fist.
<br />

<br />
Suddenly Cyrus had a thirst for something, as if it had a natural want for violence and carnage. This became even more intense as it seen a spray of blood surge out from its enemies mouth. It now knew what it wanted, it craved blood and charge, and in turn it forced its will upon Magus.
<br />

<br />
The guards looked on in horror as the person before them seemed to change into a savage creature of the darkness. There was a strange metallic sounding scream as it shoved its new found victim to the ground, only to settle into a steady rhythm of brutal punches across the mans body. All they could do was back away as again another scream was heard, blood began to spurt up into the air from the force of the attacks.
<br />

<br />
Magus had lost all control over his actions, he wanted this person dead that was all he knew now. This was what his mind was set on, as it was ignoring the fact that each time he drew back his fist more blood and flesh was being slung out into the air. He was lost in the madness that Cyrus was forcing on him.
<br />

<br />
As the judges came to they seen the horror before them, and then their eyes focused in as a silver armored had reached down and ripped it's foe's jaw clean from its head. Whatever this thing was before them it was acting like a monster, or perhaps something even worse yet. Soon it was over as the figure stood before them, splotches of blood coating the majority of the silvery armor that he wore.
<br />

<br />

<br />
The sight before him infuriated him beyond belief, as once again it seemed that his servants where no match for one who carried the Kataoka name. In fact if anything this person appeared to be even more blood thirsty than he ever was. This was going to present far more problems than he would be able to tolerate, and in truth he was afraid of this armor the young man was now in possession of.
<br />

<br />
All his best laid plans would have to be changed now to accommodate this new threat. It never failed to amaze him at how powerful these people could be. He knew first hand the kind of power they possessed, as he had nearly been killed by this young mans grandfather.
<br />

<br />
Over the years he had come to expect that they would continue to present a problem for him. This time was different though, one of them actually had scared him. For something to do this it obviously had to be special in some way. Little did he realize just how special the young man, and the armor he had seen truly where...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

Chapter 9
<br />

<br />
"New Decision, Unbalanced Fight."
<br />

<br />

<br />
The events from the day before where still fresh in everyone's minds. All who had been in the court room and witnessed what could have been described as an unbelievable power. Furthermore it was no apparent that Magus was much more than he seemed. This power that he had held both dazzled and frightened at the same time.
<br />

<br />
All the judges had held a private conference to decide just what to do with Magus. It was obvious that they couldn't exactly let him go, but then again if they didn't who knows what he could do. The choice had come down to a contest between Magus and some of their brightest pupils from the local guilds. If he could certainly beat these people then his freedom would be earned.
<br />

<br />
Of course Magus's grandfather had been listening in on this the whole time, as well as his father Cain. They both knew they would have to help Magus realize his full potential during this fight or else he'd never survive the task. If anything they had a brilliant idea on how to do this, and they knew full well what the consequences would be.
<br />

<br />
They both knew that the coliseum was going to be closed to all but close relatives and the judges themselves. Included would be Kayla, and they had only one idea on which to get Magus riled up enough to go all out. The two simply nodded as they walked toward Cain's house, which is where Kayla had been moved to after the incident.
<br />

<br />
Magus's grandmother knew from the looks on both their faces as they entered the house that something was up. Naturally Kayla could sense something as well, and it didn't settle to well with her. The elder woman had the kind of instinct to sense trouble, particularly when it involved these two old men. Though what was about to be proposed would even surprise her.
<br />

<br />
"Kayla, we're going to need your help in order to save Magus."
<br />

<br />
"We're gonna break him out?!", even for all she had been through she still had a thirst for excitement.
<br />

<br />
"No, we simply need you to go along with a plan we have. Dad will you please explain to her?"
<br />

<br />
"Well it's like this, if Magus doesn't manage to win a fight against three fighters today in the arena then things are going to get worse. We need you to follow our lead, you'll know when the time is right.", the old man had a wirier smile on his face, much to the dismay of the women in the room.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Meanwhile Magus was being informed of just what was going to happen, of course naturally he had a good idea of who was going to be picked. In fact he knew who the three best fighters in the city where. What made matters worse is they all held a grudge against him for the time he accidentally got them caught up in a bar room brawl. This in turned had earned them each severe punishment from their respective guilds, as well as costing them a great sum of money for the damages.
<br />

<br />
"Just wonderful, going up against any of them is bad enough, but all three at once is going to be a nightmare."
<br />

<br />
- The worst part is your not allowed any weapons, I'll be enjoying the view from the sidelines. -
<br />

<br />
"Weapons aren't my problem, its armor. Two of them will have armor that makes the stuff the guards use look like tin foil."
<br />

<br />
- I guess that would be a problem. I hope you have a plan on a way to beat those three then. -
<br />

<br />
"Only plan I have is if I can pull off a miracle..."
<br />

<br />
- That's about what you'll need considering the shape your in. -
<br />

<br />
Magus knew the Matsume had a point, his chances of willing where slim now. There where no plans possible that could help him in this situation. Sure he knew he was faster than before, but he had to assume they had gained just as much in speed as he had. This as well as the fact he knew all to well what kind of brute strength he was going to be facing.
<br />

<br />
- Haven't you got any special techniques you know yet? -
<br />

<br />
"None I'm afraid Matsume, aside from my sword and hand to hand skills."
<br />

<br />
- You mean you haven't a clue how to perform the 'Celestial Wake' or anything much like it? -
<br />

<br />
"I've never even heard of such a technique before."
<br />

<br />
- Terrific, I guess that was going to be one of the more advanced lessons. -
<br />

<br />
"Well it's not my fault I'm in this mess! It's that perverted old man's fault."
<br />

<br />
- You had best prepare for living hell, because that's what your body will feel like after today. -
<br />

<br />

<br />
The three that Magus had spoke of consisted of the most fierce fighters from the Warrior, Paladin, and Monk guild. This wasn't going to be an easy task for anyone, and in fact they where favorites to win in the up coming tournament held in Freeport. The residents of Qeynos where certain that these three could make it to the finals. This included even the judges who had arranged this little exhibition fight.
<br />

<br />
First off the most physically built up of the three was Zangulus, and there was good reason why. He was part barbarian, which gave him an advantage in strength over the other warriors in the guild. In fact rumors had recently spread about him having been able to knock down stone wall with a single strike of his war axe. Most people didn't question this for fear that they would find out the truth the hard way.
<br />

<br />
The paladin that had been arranged was none other then a man most called Bart. Most of his talents lay in his ability to manipulate mana as well as heal himself and others faster than his other guild mates. This also meant all of his offensive spells packed a larger punch than most other paladins which is what truly made him deadly. If anything this alone was earn respect from most people outside his guild.
<br />

<br />
Certainly the most fierce fighter of the three had to be Fei. The majority of the residents in Qeynos had already seen a glimpse of his abilities. This included his ability to smash through just about anything with his fists. As of late his training had increased beyond any that the local monks had ever endured before, which both brought him respect and the ability to avoid most conflicts.
<br />

<br />
All three of them wanted nothing more than to grind Magus to a pulp. An with the recent noticed they had received all three of them had gathered in the arena. Today was the day they where going to settle the score with Magus, as well prove themselves to be the best Qeynos had to offer. This was all that their minds where focusing on, it was something they had been training for ever since they had been disgraced in Crow's Pub.
<br />

<br />
"You two ready to pound this little bastard into the dirt.", all Zangulus could do was smile.
<br />

<br />
"I know I'm ready to regain my honor from the disgrace he caused me, what of you Fei?"
<br />

<br />
"I'm ready to prove his grandfathers techniques are nothing but rumors."
<br />

<br />

<br />
Cain sat down in the stands of the arena, his plan was the last thing he could think of. Certainly it would be enough to push Magus beyond his limits. He knew doing this would most likely result in the kind of power that his grandfather, Shoken, was capable of. This was the kind of power that he was going to need to defeat the three people here today, an continue on to the tournament in Freeport.
<br />

<br />
Kayla was still puzzled as to just what was going to happen. She had been uneasy about all this, and was reluctant to sit down along with the others. Something about this day just didn't feel right. She just knew something terrible was going to happen to Magus, she just didn't know what. Ever since she had been told that Magus fought off the assassin who threatened her life she began to think of Magus differently. It was like he had somehow become closer to here, though she wasn't certain of just how this was possible.
<br />

<br />
Shoken knew that his grandson Magus was going to have to learn how to bring out his hidden power today. It was something he knew that would have eventually happened, though he didn't like these circumstances. Though this was the only way he could win this fight now, if something wasn't done he couldn't fathom what would happen next.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Magus had a solemn look on his face as he was lead into the arena by his guards. All he could do was rub his wrists after the shackles where removed. He knew his chances of winning where slim, and what with Matsume having been returned to his grandfather, there was now no hopes of learning during the fight. Out of the corner of his eye he could see Kayla, he was glad she was here, it comforted him to know she was up and about.
<br />

<br />
"Magus, you do understand that if you lose this fight you face life imprisonment?"
<br />

<br />
"I understand, and if I manage to win then what?"
<br />

<br />
"Then you'll be free to do as you wish."
<br />

<br />
"It's not likely your going to win with us three here! I'm going to show you just how strong I've become."
<br />

<br />
"And I'm going to show you just how superior my fighting style is compared to yours."
<br />

<br />
"Prepare yourself whelp, its time took the punishment you so richly deserve."
<br />

<br />
"If everyone has said there piece, then let the fight begin!"
<br />

<br />
Magus was instantly on the defensive as his three advisari surrounded him. All he could do now was wait for one of them to make the first move, and only hope he could avoid the others. One on one he might have stood a chance, if he was in top condition, but the events from the previous day had left him drained.
<br />

<br />
The first to strike was Fei as he launched a kick into Magus's side his in turn drove him towards Zangulus. This was the perfect setup for Zangulus as he brought his foot up and stopped Magus with it as well as driving him to the ground. This all left Magus in a daze, it was evident they had all improved greatly since he had last encountered them.
<br />

<br />
With a quick snap of his hands he had managed to send Zangulus reeling off balance, which in turn gave him the chance to get back to his feet. This only proved to give Bart the target he wanted, he had been waiting for a clear shot and now he had it. Magus's felt his skin tingle as he was struck by a quick bolt of mana.
<br />

<br />
At that Fei took it upon himself to rush in and show Magus just what he had learned. Unfortunately for Magus he wasn't in the condition to move and found a fist landing perfectly across his jaw. The world dimmed for a moment, that is until he found a round kick lodge into his stomach that sent him off balance and falling back into the massive body of Zangulus.
<br />

<br />
All Kayla could do was watch on in horror as Magus was being systematically picked apart by the three in the arena with him. There was nothing she could do and this only made things worse for her. This was the worst feeling she had ever felt, not being able to help someone when she knew it was possible.
<br />

<br />
Shoken on the other hand knew all to well that with Magus's previous injuries it was near impossible for him to do anything except this. He knew that the young man's talents leaned more towards using swords than his fists, but using a sword wasn't an option now. All he could do was wait until the time was right to give Magus the extra shove he needed to unlock his hidden talents.
<br />

<br />
Magus was once again reeling from one of Fei's assaults, this time it was a flying kick that sent him towards Zangulus once more. Today though Zangulus had decided to bring with him one of his favorite weapons, a huge battle hammer, the likes of which would strain most men to pick up. This was what Magus felt was he was literally belted into the air by the hard mental end of the hammer.
<br />

<br />
As his luck would have it Magus found himself coming down near Bart, which mean he was about to receive yet more punishment. Of course this just happened to the use of a shield that Bart happily drove Magus to the ground with. In truth Magus was hit so hard the shield had a dent from the impact on his head.
<br />

<br />
For Magus the world was spinning around, he could feel something running down the side of his head. He knew for certain it had to have been blood, it couldn't have been anything else. All he could do was stand up and prepare for the next attack, hoping that something would present itself so that he could at least disable one of his foes.
<br />

<br />
"Stop it already! Leave him alone!"
<br />

<br />
In the distance Magus heard something, it was someone crying, it was a woman. He recognized the voice, but couldn't place that person as crying over him. If anything he still expected her to try and get back at him for all the things that had happened. He managed to once again bring himself to his feet, and glanced over towards Kayla.
<br />

<br />
It was true, she couldn't believe it, but it was true. Kayla found herself crying over what was happening to Magus. She simply couldn't bare to watch any more of the abuse he was taking. This was worse than anything she had ever seen in her life, and knew Magus didn't deserve anything like this to happen.
<br />

<br />
"Look Magus has himself a girlfriend... She must be a tramp to go out with such a despicable person."
<br />

<br />
"Maybe after this is all done she can show Zangulus just what she is? What is it that warriors believe in again?"
<br />

<br />
"To the victor goes the spoils of war. Come to think of it she would look good without her cloths."
<br />

<br />
At hearing this the judges naturally assumed the fight was over. It was apparent to them that Magus had no hopes of winning this fight now. They had played their hand and now knew that it was impossible for him to resist being imprisoned now. Everything had worked out the way they had hoped.
<br />

<br />
Inside Magus's mind the meaning of all that he heard was beginning to sink in. Before he had heard those words his body had ached all over, but now the pain was receding. In place of the pain he was beginning to feel a burning sensation. It then dawned on him it was his own anger that was doing this. The rage he felt literally gave his body a burning sensation, without pain he now began to recover from his daze.
<br />

<br />
"And the winners are....", before the judges could announce anything they where interrupted.
<br />

<br />
"It's not over yet...... I'm not finished!"
<br />

<br />
"Well it looks like he's standing again, the whelp must want more of a beating."
<br />

<br />
"Your not going to touch her..."
<br />

<br />
"You've lost and we've won, face it, we'll do what we want!"
<br />

<br />
The Matsume could feel a change happening to Magus, it knew he was getting ready to break through the barrier that had been repressing his latent abilities. If anything it was prepared to witness the kind of power it's master was capable of. It was curious, it wanted to know more about what kind of talents Magus had, and it wanted to know more about that armor it had felt before.
<br />

<br />
"That's enough!!! You not going to touch her!!! I'll die before you do!"
<br />

<br />
The pendant around Magus's neck began to glow brightly. Cyrus felt its master's will, it felt him calling for power. Yet it was waiting, it some how knew he was calling for some other force as well, and it wanted to see just what that was. It wanted to experience just what its owner was fully capable of.
<br />

<br />
An ethereal aura began to surround Magus's form, his eyes had now changed as they shined with a crimson light like that of a heated metal. Every inch of his body felt as if it was infused with a new found strength, and in reaction to this his muscles began to enlarge under the strain. The pupils of his eyes had completely disappeared, which gave him an eerie almost otherworldly look. 
<br />

<br />
This only proved to send chills up the judges spines, they hadn't expected this at all. If anything they where now regretting making the decision to hold this fight. Even worse was the fact that this was all happening without the appearance of the armor they had seen the day before. They weren't sure which to fear more, the fact he was capable of this without the armor, or what might happen if the armor appeared while he was like this.
<br />

<br />
Kayla couldn't believe her eyes, but she could believe what she felt. It was Magus, he had become so powerful, and it was because of her. He had done this to once again protect her from these people. He was doing this to not for himself, but to up hold her dignity. This was something she would have never imagined Magus doing before this day.
<br />

<br />
The first to move forward and test their mettle was Fei, who tried for his flying kick. Only this time he found himself being yanked from the air and sent hurling into the arena wall. The impact alone from his body was enough to cause the other two to wince. They knew Fei definitely wasn't going to be able to shrug that off.
<br />

<br />
Zangulus was the next to try his luck, trying to buy Fei the time he needed to recover from that blow. He rushed forward with his battle hammer, swinging it down as he aimed for Magus's head. For a moment time seemed to slow down as Magus avoided the hammer and span around, ramming his foot into his attackers stomach. The sound of metal being bent, then cracking could be heard as Zangulus fell to the ground.
<br />

<br />
This had bought Fei the time he needed to renew his assault, this time he rushed in with a flurry of punches. Try as he might though, he simply couldn't keep up with Magus now. Never before had he seen someone who could match him at full speed, that is until now. Before he could muster a defense he found a uppercut from Magus connecting with his stomach, this in turn caused him to double over.
<br />

<br />
Bart watched on in horror as he frantically worked at healing Zangulus's wounds. Never before had he seen such damage caused by a simple attack. He knew full well that Fei was probably in the same shape as he finished doing what he could for Zangulus. In fact Fei was in worse shape as he lay on the ground coughing out mouthfuls of blood.
<br />

<br />
Without warning Zangulus once again rushed into the battle again as Bart took up healing Fei. The warrior was now fully enraged and was determined to show Magus just why people feared him. Once again his best attempt at hitting Magus with his battle hammer was avoided, and now he was open once more.
<br />

<br />
This was it for Magus, he was now tired of dealing with Zangulus and was going to put him out of commission. At deciding this he launched an assault of punches on the warriors face much more fierce than any monk could ever have. Just as Fei before him, Zangulus was hit with an uppercut to the stomach, only this one had enough force to raise him off his feet. The last thing Zangulus seen was a round house kick which connected with his face, that in turn drove him into the nearby arena wall.
<br />

<br />
Bart knew he needed to buy some time for Fei to recover, so he did the only thing he could which was rush forward with his shield in front of him. This proved to be useless as Magus shoved his fist through the spot where the metal had become dented and then tore the shield from his attack's grasp. With that done the shield was threw aside causing it to skid across the dirt.
<br />

<br />
It didn't take long for Magus to siege Bart's sword hand by the wrist. There was silence for a moment then the air was fill with a cracking sound and then howls of pain. Magus had broken his foe's arm at the wrist, and was now going to make short work of him. Another gruesome snapping was heard and Bart was just pushed away, his hands where now useless.
<br />

<br />
The paladin had done just what he intended to do, he had bought Fei the time to get back to his feet and back into the battle. This time around he was more cautious as he slowly moved in searching for a open spot in Magus's defenses. Fei thought he spotted an opening and launched a round kick towards Magus's legs, only he found it to be soon blocked by a shin.
<br />

<br />
This was all Magus needed as he grabbed a hold of Fei's head in a clench and proceeded to ram knee after knee into knee into his stomach. Fei then found himself flung away, he had lost a lot of his steam on that last assault and was barely able to breath. With his last bit of strength he lunged forward with a punch, only to have find it parried away.
<br />

<br />
At having done this Magus once again grabbed a hold of Fei's head and leapt into the air, driving his knee into the center of his face. This wasn't the end of the monk's punishment though, with what was left of the momentum Magus had managed to completely flip over Fei. In turn when he landed this sent Fei to the arena wall once more.
<br />

<br />
All the judges could do was stare on in both fear and amazement. Magus had managed to defeat three people who where each considered to be more than his equal. They had little time to contemplate this, since Magus turned his attention once again to them.
<br />

<br />
"I've beaten them, they can't fight anymore and they're lucky I spared their lives. I'll be leaving now..."
<br />

<br />
Magus felt his strength already beginning to wane as he looked into the stands at his family. Then his attention was brought to Kayla, he now knew she was safe from harm. It was then that he fell to one knee, exhaustion had finally set in. The great strength he had managed to summon was now fading away.
<br />

<br />
Cyrus could feel this, and it now knew its owners limitations. It could now determine just what it could safely expose Magus to without harming itself or him in the process. Still the emotions it felt from its owner puzzled it greatly. It knew not of what these feelings meant or where, it realized it would need more time to discover the meaning behind them...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>
