Do you think the two sexes should be balanced? I mean, as a female on the procreation side-quest, you run the risk of having low health for 9 months, then extreme pain for a day or so, then you must support a newbie until at least level 18, killing your funds. The males have it so much easier.

Yeah, I just really hope I can get a character in the next version. It sucks how only a couple people are allowed in from the start, and then more players are added over time.
<br />

<br />
I'm hoping I get in real early, back in the primitive days, before the rules are implemented. That way I'd be able to do whatever I want with my character without fear of being banned. There would also be a downside, as being in the game that early means there isn't much known about the world yet, so our characters are less intelligent.

I'm still irritated about t3h gr4h1x!!! I hear that hackers can alter your moniter if you're having problems seeing. When I equip my "Glasses" to fix it normally, I have to endure -4 to charisma, so having them laser hack me might be nice, if not dangerous. God really needs to figure out what causes the problem. Probably screen resolution bugs.
<br />

<br />
I was actually having that problem, but I called tech support and they told me I needed to update the drivers on my graphics card.

For people experiencing the "Bad Eye sight" status effect, the developer has released a new patch called "Contact Lenses" they are an updated version of "Glasses", yes they certainly cost more, but they fix your problem without charisma loss

<br />
And this game really should allow you to customize your player from the beginning. Im stuck looking half decent to bad. These things called "Genes" determine our look for us, this really should eb rectified

Dudes, the 1.2 ver. (Called "Middle ages" by vets like me) were pure badass. You could totally PK anything in your path, and the guild wars between the catholics and islamics were awesome. 
<br />

<br />
Then some n00bs that played rouges with a lot of skill points in swashbuckling started camping in the Mediterranean ocean and PK'D everyone in sight.
<br />
This caused trouble because that was the only way we had back in the day to get to places that gave good Exp. (Yup, the India server used to be good, mainly because you could sell the spoils the monsters gave you for a crapload of gold).
<br />

<br />
Then, this player called "Christopher Columbus" complained to the admin, and he made the new servers, South and North America. Also, Chris was the first player from another server that stepped in there.
<br />

<br />
Then his guild, Spain (He used to be from another guild, but they got pissed at him and kicked him out) started camping and looting in America, because the players that started there had really crappy stats (Some guilds with the "civilization" rank, and had so many points invested in architecture, geometry, and astrology it wasn't even funny, but alas, they hadn't any actual combat skill. Hell, they used freaking WOODEN STICKS WITH POINTY ENDS as weapons! You can't even sell that crap!).
<br />

<br />
Then they kinda stood there, made a few camps called "colonies", and long story short, everyone forgot about PvP and started farming money.
<br />

<br />
That's when this game started to suck. I mean, you had classes that where pure, unadulterated badass like Paladins and Pirates, and what you have now? Businessmen and CEOs. This game became too economy driven for my tastes.

wtf? I got to level 20, completed the "Medical School" sidequest and when that was finished, at level 25 I chose the Abortionist job because nobody else had it. Now whereever I go there's like 50 people holding sticks with paper attached to them, and they yell at me a lot. What are they supposed to do? Do I get +6 Combat from them?

I tried to get side quest in literature degree. I found it a lot easier when using the magical dragon pipe. It gives +20 in all imagination stats but -15 in wang growth rate.

Dude! there will be no patch.
<br />

<br />
The game's old, the engine is outdated, and the developers have all quit.
<br />

<br />
The company will release a new game, there's rumors that the new game will have 2 playable races with 3 genders each. There will also be different servers for different playing styles (combat server, farming server)... i think the segregated servers will suck though, there is no way of creating an empire in the farming servers because you can't pk there.

I really think the penalty to the Men class for getting kicked in the nuts is unfair. I mean, when Women get kicked in the crotch they can move right away. Men aren't allowed to move for a week or two. God really needs to balance that.

Oh, and about the permadeath thing: I've heard from some people that you can transfer to some sort of exclusive server or area after your character dies, although claims about the prerequisites seem to vary. Anyone know anything about this? The suicide bomber class will need a serious overhaul if this isn't true and people find out.

Then there are the characters who customize their character to where they have all black on, piercings everywhere, black shadow, and black hair or lipstick. They also for some reason attempt to shut down their own accounts at an early level and randomly do damage to themselves.
