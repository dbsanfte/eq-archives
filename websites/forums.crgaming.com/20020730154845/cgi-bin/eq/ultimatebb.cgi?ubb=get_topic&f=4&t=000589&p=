But I don't think this way.. I think it as people who are just fine in their big guilds who do not wish to move because of their friends or people who just can't stand verant and would never pay them 40 bucks a month - yet continue to play the game for years to come..   <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"> Nothing wrong with that.<P>Call me special or call me whatever ya want.. but I still sense jealousy    <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"><BR>Btw go ahead and flame this all ya want, I want to laugh, hehe.

<STRONG>"I think your inability to use quote correctly makes you "special" enough."</STRONG><P>Lol I love people who base players on the way they know how to work a msg board quoting system.. funny stuff<P><STRONG>"1. I think it is funny that ppl pay to post their characters when you can do it for free here.<P>2. I think it is funny that ppl pay for a map/maps that you can also get for free. Hell you even get one in the box."</STRONG><P>1.)True you can post for free but I bet there are some things that Magelo and what not cant do, and I know this may sound strange.. but I personally hate spam mail I get from free crap sites that throw my email at every advertising company available.<BR>2.)I will only be using the map so I dont have to press a thousand /whos and get people anon/roleplaying.. I can check the map for friends/guildmates and there they are.<P><STRONG>"3. I think it is funny thou Verant still has not fixed Luclin, pissed off mages and necros in the last interviews they have the nerve to focus their efforts on a new project which the eq population turned down in Aug. of 2000.</STRONG><P>I agree it is dumb verant never finished luclin and threw it out on the market.. but that doesn't mean they aren't working to fix it.. And this has been stressed constant times that EQ LEGENDS IS A TOTALLY DIFFERENT TEAM. If you read anything but the general discussion forums you might already know about this.. Yes the EQ population turned down this project but why do you think they started it? Because they got plenty of comments and ideas from people who thought it would be a good idea.<P><STRONG>"4. I think it is funny that ppl think this new legends server will allow dynamic change to the world of Norrath. Basically, all you will be doing is follow a mock play verant has setup for you. The new server will can't/will not be as dynamic as the sleeper idea. It takes coders... not 19 GMs. (Ok maybe some GMs to carry out the event.)"</STRONG><P>You continue to use this in other threads yet you just don't understand. Yes verant has to shut zones down and add patches to make zones more dynamic but that doesn't mean they won't do it.. they have more than 19 GMs I assure you as well as coders for this project. Hell I've seen PoH mobs in mountains of rathe in an event before.. so of course they will do things like this at 40 bucks a month...<P><STRONG>"5. I think it is funny that ppl don't think the power gamers won't go to this new server for EASY EXTREME PhAt LoOt that they don't even have to work for. (The Visa pic in Befallen is soooooooo true about Legends.)"</STRONG><P>Whos to say the Gms will jsut give them new items without work? If I recall.. Ive been involved in quite a few GM events and never received anything.. only a lucky few did. Im sure this will be the same way except more and more of them, so a better chance -if you put the time in it to help the quest that is- to get items sure. Not 'here you go, newb' And that visa pic is not true about legends.. it seems more true to me about an ebayer's paradise. Why do you think verant is against ebay? /sigh<P><STRONG>"6. I think it is funny how you truely believe Legends is for the casual Gamer."</STRONG><P>There are many times of gamers moving to legends.. give me a reason why legends would not be for the casual gamer?<P><STRONG>"I guess you could say I, however, am outraged much like the rest of the EQ community that verant used profits to hire on new GMs when they really need more programmers."</STRONG><P>You mean "I am mad because bank of america has a new premium service that costs more money but gives the people what they always wanted, they should should only do what I want them to do with their money because I pay them a measely 10 dollars for my standard account." -Same scenario with many businesses, yet no one cares, hmm.. And if you are so pissed about how they deal with money (even tho this is a SEPARATE project) why do you still play? Friggen sad how much people cry and they still PAY AND PLAY lol. Where do they get the money to make star wars galaxies? Oh no! they jacking our eq money again to use in another game! And also.. how do you know they are low on programmers? Have you done a head count lately at their main office?<P><STRONG>"If you call this comment jealousy well hate to brake it too you but alot of players will agree with me there needs to be some major bug fixes and class balances. We still have a class that is unfinished, BST. Lets hope that Beastlord patch goes well this up coming patch."</STRONG><P>And of course I definitly agree with you.. lots of things need to be balanced and fixed for a rushed expansion like luclin.. yet you have to understand they ARE working on it! Yer money is not being funneled into EQ legends.. they are making a gamble if anything and they will pay it off with the money they receive from it.<P><STRONG>"Think if Verant actually hired more programmers we may have ppl with Win95 OS's able to play Luclin instead of the... Maybe legends is to make up for the lost profit inwhich they lost many gamers then. </STRONG><P>I highly disagree.. I would say hardly any of the eq population had win95 still... hell I havent known or seen anyone with win95 in years! I do agree though, they should have known if win95 was going to be removed.. but it is also partly microsoft's fault.. microsoft chose not to support win95 yet made a great graphics support with directx 8.. My god, unless people had NO OTHER GAMES on their comp but EQ and software from the early 90's or something.. many games required directx. Its just hard to believe verant actually took a hit at all from these people.<P><STRONG>There are so many Quests unfinished it is getting ridiculous.</STRONG><P>Again, I agree.. there are MANY things unfinished with this game that they need to fix but it is still a fun game all-in-all.. if these little things upset you so much why do you even bother playing? Remember.. playing this game is supporting verant, not damning them.<P>Have a nice day.

Get a life pal it will be SUPER easy hence the name "Training Wheel Server."  The Visa picture was and exageration and /sarcasm on my part but I can see how you were fooled at first.

First off, I would like to say that way you responded to my last post was very unprofessional unlike how I responded to your post. You right-out sound like a little 15 year old trying so hard to win a little msg board dispute. <BR>Now.. on with the fun stuff   <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"> <P><STRONG>"Yeah, I do think it is funny that you can't use quote correctly.<BR>And now I think it is funny that you don't know better to check that box given... even here... that asks that your e-mail not be given out. Can you be any more "Special" Vrelik. Did you go to college?"</STRONG><P>LOL does it really make you laugh? Man I'm proud of you &lt;cough-15-year-old-cough&gt;<BR>And WTF are you talking about I didn't check the box that says "don't post email address" Actually I double checked in case, and it WAS checked.. idiot. And to your final question, yes I am currently in college, did you finish high school yet?<P><STRONG>"Thousands of whos you say to look up friends and Guildmates. God, could it be any easier remedial boy. Its just count them... TWO 'whose' you need to use: /who all friend and /who all GUILD. Not a thousand whose and who can say if they are anon they won't be anon on your given map."</STRONG><P>Actually.. NO it's not /who all GUILD newbie high school student.. there's a little thing called "request was too short" ever heard of that? I just might have to do a few more /whos now won't I? Bright one you are.<P><STRONG><BR>"2. Yes, the majority of EQ population did turn it down but Verant went one with it anyways. Going against majority of customer opinion cause complaints and is bad business. Hence what you see."</STRONG><P>Your a dumbass.. need I say more about this section? I guess I will anyway: Verant didn't do this against the people, they said clearly they had many many positive comments and ideas about a service like this RECENTLY. How is this going against the majority of the customer opinion? MAJORITY voted "no" in august of 2000.. TWO YEARS AGO!!! They received these comments recently, genious.<P><STRONG>"3. Yeah they are getting comments right now and I will tell you it is mostly complaints and not praise being delivered to their dev. board. They have even stated most of these complaints several times."</STRONG><P>Yes we all have seen these complaints.. and what is their purpose? Jealous people like you who think the cash is being taken away from their $9.89 a month when nothing is being touched from your game.. they have 400k users with $9.89 a month each player.. they have plenty of money to pay for both.<P><STRONG>"How can you assure me they have coders for the EQ Legends server, they just said they hired 19 GMs not Coders. See, I can pull the same pig-head thing you did in the 4 quotes down? YOU DON'T KNOW. And I think, I do know how some of the EQ engine works, Remedial Boy, because I do have a BS degree in Computers Science class of 2000 and I am creating (very slowly) such a game.<BR>Where as you don't know somethings as simply as html code or check boxes it seems."</STRONG><P>What is to assure you? You are so blindly pissed you would rather throw yourself off a cliff than transfer to eq legends. All I know is they have DONE IT BEFORE and they will DO IT AGAIN on eq legends.. and if they don't? NO BIGGIE $40 bucks for ONE month and I'm back to $9.89 a month.. wooptie. Any losses? No.. I tried it and now I have piece of mind. I like the game enough to give it a try..<P>Yes many people know about how the EQ engine works.. you got a BS in computer science you say? Wow I hope your attitude wasn't like this thru college because yer a dick, basically. Yes I do know a bit of HTML, no I don't spend my time making many web pages, and yes you are still a dumbass for saying I show my email for every post I make because it is indeed checked to NOT show my email.<P><STRONG>"Ha Ha Ha, your telling me you did not get one thing in the Halloween events? Not a single armor piece from lake Rathe. Since every mob in Lake Rathe had a chance of dropping something. Or how about Kithicor they still drop the same weapons except maybe one from the day the event started that GM event. Get a life pal it will be SUPER easy hence the name "Training Wheel Server." The Visa picture was and exageration and /sarcasm on my part but I can see how you were fooled at first. Here is some more sarcasm lets see if you consider it to be true. Vrelik when you went to take your middleschool IQ test did you go to the local game store and pick up EQ instead?"</STRONG><P>HA HA HA.. hmm let's do a vote folks: is this dude really thru college?   <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"> <P>Actually no, at that time of halloween I was trying out DAOC, which I didn't really end up liking and returned to EQ. But I have been in many GM events before, I assure you. How will me getting a life effect the server's easiness?? Wait a sec, let me get this straight.. "GET A LIFE" coming from someone who believes this is a training wheel server? As in you are so uber because your life is this game, etc? Hmm whos the one who needs a life.. the person who is getting it "easier" as you say or the one who lives on EQ? How can you blindly flame this server without trying it out WHEN ITS RELEASED without proper facts? Say it's easy all you want.. I'll believe it when I see it.. you wanna know easy? Goto DAOC..<P><STRONG>"1. PhAt LeWt<P>2. Power Gamers<P>3. PvP players, trouble makers from other severs. (Verant will not banned their grieving players that are paying $40)<P>4. Ebayers <BR>(don't tell me the items will be no drop either because I was at LoIO Halloween event where they gave out a heirophant cloak, turtle belt, and an awesome robe all dropable and all to 15-20th lvl players.)"</STRONG><P>You want to know the truth, The Truth? (hehe hey what ya know, THE TRUTH is being taught the truth  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"> ) Many people do not want to pay the extra $30 a month, that the population you listed will be a lot lower than you think.. except for maybe ebayers.. but how do ebayers effect casual gamers? Does it bother me that they buy some lvl 60? Does it bother me they buy 23984938 plat and uber equip? How does this effect me, pray tell. If you think that an army of ebayers will win, that makes no sense.. because a lot of ebayers are newbs.. so they won't...<P><STRONG>"I told you the general Eq community turned it down in Aug of 2000. So it was not what they wanted."</STRONG><P>And how many players have left since then? How many newbies have come? How the hell can you relate to something 2 years old with TODAY's everquest, changing this much every year? The majority might have said they were against it, but this server is to give people of EQ what they always have wanted and sended in requests for.. otherwise they wouldn't be doing it. These "things people want" cost money..  <IMG SRC="rolleyes.gif" border="0"> Sad.<P><STRONG>"This is pig headed."</STRONG><P>Was it really pig headed? Or did I have a point you couldn't think of a flame for?   <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"> <P><STRONG>"There is no gamble.<BR>How can you honestly say the players money is not being funneled to EQ Legends Project. HOW THE HELL DO YOU THINK THE PROJECT WAS CREATED? What they just got the money from thin air? They just hired the GMs made office space for them all for free? They just got a brand new free bunch of severs? I know they just took out a Huge loan just for this project, ha ha ha. God, you are remedial. They would make 'more' money by raising the monthly pay by one dollar and hiring those same GMs to be scattered on the orginal servers.</STRONG><P>Yes there is a gamble.. they waste money if it doesn't work. and you still haven't answered MY question: "WHAT GIVES YOU THE RIGHT TO TELL THEM WHAT TO DO WITH THEIR MONEY?" American business friend, deal with it. And you still have nothing to say about the money going into star wars galaxies.. ONLY about how this legends server is such a bad idea and you are relying too much on how customers voted 'no' TWO years ago.. sigh<P>Yes they would make more money raising the normal rate by a few dollars, but that is also in the LONG RUN. Their goal isn't to please the entire eq population with this premium service.. I can understand it isn't for everybody money-wise and such.. but have you ever considered, "WOW maybe someone thought this was a good idea! /GASP".. either way, are you going to make their decisions? I'm sure they've done plenty more research on this subject than you.. and if you think an entire company (verant) can't compete with your opinions as well as the same 5-10 flamers on general discussion, you're wrong.<P><STRONG>"I told you in the original post I am moving to FF11 when it comes out but for now I have to deal with EQ mistakes. Squaresoft has and awesome track record which is more than I can say for Verant.</STRONG><P>So you have to DEAL with eq's mistakes hmm? Like its your obligation yet you have a burning hatred for verant.. thats funny as hell to me. I have an idea.. go get some friends in RL, get a job, play some games that you actually like... my god..<P>In conclusion, Im sick of dealing with people who are so ignorant like you and will have nothing to do with other's opinions beside their own. Go ahead and keep flaming the hell out of me. I'll just be watching and laughing from here on   <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"><P>It's no wonder these boards have such a reputation of *******s. Why do I bother posting? I have no idea..

Wow there are a lot of things wrong in your post above.  Smallest being the /who issue because you are limited to the amount of friends you have so cutting off the list is not possible.  And you can, (Rather easily might I add), manipulate /who all GUILD with specific lvl ranges, class types, and racial types (and oh name types like all the those that begin with 'a' in their name).  Hell you can Macro the buttons if your that lazy but I guess if your SUPER lazy and remedial (like those that can't use quote) you can get the map.                <IMG SRC="biggrin.gif" border="0"><P>The largest being the defense to my description of the type of players that will be going to Legends.

Besides the fact, I knew you were to afraid to give out the names of those high lvl character you have in your signature.  And your DAOC reasoning is really shining.  Question?  How did you get those high lvl character if you were playing DAOC and in College.  When I got my BS degree in Computer Science I tended to remember I was studying and going to classes.  I would still play EQ but only managed to get two characters to 60 since March of 1999 and I am a powergamer. <P>(Dah are you maybe a powergamer but by your own anology above not to many of you are going to the Legends Server, hm nah your more like a lying noob.)  <P>By the way Vrelik I lied (heh exaggerated) about something on purpose to waver my arguement.  It seems your not as old a character as you put off, in your willingness to believe the statement below.  <P>The August 1999 poll was a split poll.  Verant stated that EQ community poll results showed the players split on paying the extra fee.  In the end, Verant threw out the idea.<P>I will give you a test thou how did they construct the poll?  <BR>This is a really simple ass question.  But I, am takening emence glee in your unknowledgable newbie posts.  I have shown it around the office to different co-programmers I work with and play EQ with too.  It is truly a riot.<P>The Truth<P>(Nothing personal Vrelik you have all the smell of a Noob.)

Waitaminute... you mean he had to study to get his BS in Comp Sci?<BR>must...control...laughter<P>I'm sorry, but gimme a break.  4 years in comps is really only hard if you never did any sort of playing on your own.<P>Let's see... I'm guessing he entered a cheapie college at the age of 16/17, 4 years of study... Hey guys, he might be able to buy a beer, so quit the age bashing.  I know mature 15-year olds, and I also know immature 45-year olds.

Ha ha ha<P>Vrelik could not even defend yourself there very nice.<P>Rath1 haven't ppl called you the BIGGEST GENERAL FOREUM TROLL before didn't they even try to get you banned from these boards.  You got OWNed on the whole discuss of Trival Loot.  You then went into hiding and now your back to probably get whacked about Legends too.  Please, Rath1, I like everyone else take what you have to say with a grain of salt.  Your a Joke.<P>Tigran Loftside <BR>You obviously don't have a BS in Computer Science.  There is a little class in all schools that is required to get the degree called Operating Systems.  You have to Literally create an operating system.  Tigran do you even know what is an Operating System I will give you a hint your using one right now.  Yeah Windows is really simple to program.  But I must admit my Operating System was really complex but way crude compared to Windows maybe a little more like Unix.  <P>Please Tigran Loftside you look like an idiot say that getting a BS CS degree is easy.  Hell, it was required in my College to take Calc 3.  Ever calculate the area of one polygon on the backside of a Torus? (A Torus is in theory completely smooth but can be made up with series of polygons) Go ahead call that easy... Tigran get a life, fanboy.<P>The Truth

Lol give the Vrelic guy a break... <P>He reacted in a polite way on a flame, explaining how and what and he got flamed even more. No wonder he is LHAO.<P>If you are pissed at Verant because they put money in a new project instead of finishing the old one... Have a nice rant at the Sony boards... <P>I disagree on 1 point with you Vrelic:<BR>The fact that we should not worry because "another team" is working on EQL.<P>Fact is that they made money from what now the "standard" servers are, released a not quite finished product, and used that money to pay new programmers to work on something else...<P>They are working on something new while they cant even get MIDI to play right under 2000 and XP, the systems you NEED to play EQ on because of the insane memory requirements. Winows 98 and ME dont use more then 512MB...<P>There is light at the end of the tunnel though.. Maybe Verant thinks the people paying 40 bucks a month have more right to complain and get bug-fixes. <P>Sad part is that the people who have made EQ possible for 3 years probably *arent* worth it, this is a big dent in the pride of alot of EQ players and this is where most of the reactions come from.

The Truth again proves how stupid he really is.. I got owned on the whole trivial loot code thing? really? that's news to me.  As I remember it a lot of people disagreed with me and some people agreed, all the arguements eventually got old and died out, nobody got owned.  The people who called me a troll were people like Airtreader who call everyone who disagrees with them trolls.. you however start an entire flame war about someone because you are jelous of them, that makes you a troll.<P>I think you should just leave these boards and stfu, you have been owned by Vrelik and by many others who see you as a 4 year old baby whining about something because he can't have it, I know your daddy won't let you use his credit card to pay for legends, stop crying about it and get some class.

No Rathr1 you were owned in that Trival Loot arguement it was soooooo funny when you learned that Verant decided not to include Trival loot to Luclin.  When before you were telling ppl that to live with it.  I thought you were going to cry posting stuff like well "Sniffle well babies you got what you wanted."  <BR>Ha Ha Ha that was great posted thread.  aaahhhggg *sigh memories.<P>You made such a fuss and abused other posters after learning that you were not getting what you wanted and were made to look like a fool.  It was suggested a general forum thread to the bae.. that you be banned.  For your Trolling.  Then you hid like a coward.  Now you have resurfaced... but for how long now?<P>The Truth

Lol.. you arn't even good at lieing The Truth, your just one huge drain on society, I suggest you do everyone a favor and just stfu for once.<P>I never made a fuss when I learned TLC would not be included.. you completely made that up from your dried up little raisen of a brain.  Nobody ever owned me, all arguements against TLC were weak power gamer complaints, but since such a majority didn't want it that's the way it had to be.. oh well.<P>And what in the hell are you talking about? I never heard once that I was going to be banned from the boards, again you completely make this crap up, get a life and try actually telling the Truth you dumb b*tch.

And then after the search hit the More button above the lists of posts going back to Aug-Sep posts.  Where you got OWNED in the TLC debates.  You had like 10 or so TLC debates.  God, your funniest one was when Logix Smeared you all over the place then suddenly around 2001 ish you disappeared for a while.  Probably ashamed that you did not get your TLC and you probably went to DAOC.  hmm are you Vrelik in disguise?<P>The Truth

Woah, you actually wrote that in rainbow colors The Truth.. good job.  When the hell did Logix smear me? again your posting a bunch of horse crap that never happened, it's true that i stopped posting for a while.. but that was long after the TLC debate was dead.  The TLC crap was a long time ago, and it's really sad that you'd wanna bring that back up.. no one ever got "owned" as you put it.<P>Anyways, you can go back to writing rainbow colored flames you ferri.

Typical Leg Humper post!!  LoL!!<P><I>Absolutely no</I> counter-arguments for the previous posters!  Just childish personal attacks!  Haha!

By your atrocious spelling and immature manners you can't be more than 13!!<P>So let's examine the words I used to descibe you and see if they fit:<P>Lying - I already proved you to be a liar in my previous post.  You change your facts as you see fit.<P>Sniveling - to speak or act in a whining, sniffling, tearful, or weakly emotional manner.  That fits you to a tee.<P>Jealous - hostile toward a rival or <I>one believed to enjoy an advantage</I>.  That's you!! LoL!<P>Brat - an ill-mannered annoying child b : an ill-mannered immature person.  14 or 40, this word has you covered too.<P>You might see them as 1st grade words, as if, I see them as descriptive words that describe YOUR personality <B>perfectly</B>.  <P><BR> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR> Dantes, the adults are discussing. Why don't you go to bed now. Thats a good boy. Sheesh, kids today.  <HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>There are a lot of adults here posting, true.  But you aren't one of them.  Why don't you act like an adult and respond to some of the questions and allegations people post here LIKE WHY YOU CHANGE YOU EQ POPULATION NUMBERS TO FIT YOUR ARGUMENT??  Or explain how you have a BS and write things like 'A posed.'<P>ANSWER THOSE LEG HUMPER! EVEN THOUGH YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN TOO EMBARRASSED FROM MY LAST POST TO EVEN COME BACK HERE.  YOU WERE EXPOSED AS A LIAR AND A HYPOCRITE BY YOUR OWN POSTS!<P>Best Regards,<P>Dantes
