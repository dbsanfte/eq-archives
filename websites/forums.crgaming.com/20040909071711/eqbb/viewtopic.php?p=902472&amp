So far the questions being asked are being dismissed with flimsy excuses like "omg he wasn't on teh same boat" or "the timing of this is very suspect".  Erm, the timing of A LOT of things during an election campaign is going to be 'suspect'.
<br />

<br />
The real question is- does the timing have anything to do with how true the claims are?  If Kerry's military service, which he has been using in promoting his campaign, has some serious holes in it, he had damn well better pray that people pay it no more mind than they did to Bush's guard service.  The frenzy on Dubyah's service died down when people finally realized that the criticism didn't hold up.  Will the criticism of Kerry's record hold up, if the attention grows?

There's reason to think that it won't, so far.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

He decried the method of the ad's attack, condemning the <span style="font-style: italic">tactic</span> - - as did the White House. But he did not call the ad "a lie." He'd have to lie to do so, as he has no way of knowing the actual truth of the charges.
<br />

<br />
I know you have a hard time telling the difference between truth and lies, lebuah, but PLEASE try to keep up.
<br />

<br />
As to the "served with" issue. They <span style="font-style: italic">did</span> serve with him. They simply were not under his command on his boat. Kerry's campaign's assertions are carefully worded to give a false impression of the truth. "Didn't serve on his boat" is not the same this as "didn't serve with him." Misdirection - - a normal lawyerly tactic.
<br />

<br />
Likewise, his lawyer's assertions that the guy on the ad that says "I treated his wound" is lying because he's not "the doctor who signed the medical report" filed later, is a careful "apples and oranges" misdirection. The guy <span style="font-style: italic">is</span> in fact the corpsman that <span style="font-style: italic">treated</span> Kerry's injury... and prepared the treatment report that the doctor in charge of the sickbay later signed. That has been established as true. Kerry never saw the <span style="font-style: italic">doctor</span> - - and this is typical of treatment of minor injuries in the military. Corpsmen are like nurse-practitioners. Unless you're in dire straits, you generally don't see a doctor. That goes double during combat.
<br />

<br />
I was in the service four years, and was in sickbay maybe 12-15 times between minor injuries, checkups, and innoculations and such. In four years, I actually was spoken to or treated by an actual "doctor" exactly three times. They're hard to miss; they're officers, the corpsmen are usually not. Yet every treatment report had to be read and approved by the on-duty doctor. He reviews the corpsman's write-up and unless he sees a problem with the treatment, signs it.
<br />

<br />
The people involved with SBVfT were Kerry's peers (fellow boat commanders in the same squadron) and his superiors in his chain of command.
<br />

<br />
Who's better-equipped to observe and judge an officer's fitness for duty and adherence to orders: the other commanders operating under the same orders on the same missions, and the superiors that gave the orders, or the guys driving, fighting, and fixing the boat who only got the handed-down orders from the guy in question?

1. If most of Kerry's fellow Swift veterans don't support him, then who were all those guys with him at the Democratic Convention? They made it appear that Kerry has the complete support of his "Band of Brothers" from Vietnam.
<br />

<br />
John Kerry has been able to convince about 13 men who served on Swift boats in the Mekong Delta to support him, 7 or 8 of whom were at various times crew members on his own 6-man boat. Those are the men the Kerry campaign so prominently featured at the Democratic Convention. <span style="font-weight: bold">The photograph we have posted at SwiftVets.com shows Kerry with 19 of his fellow Swift boat OICs (Officers In Charge) in Coastal Division 11.</span> Four OICs were not present for the photograph. <span style="font-weight: bold">Only one of his 23 fellow OICs from Coastal Division 11 supports John Kerry.</span>
<br />

<br />
Overall, more than 250 Swift boat veterans are on the record questioning Kerry's fitness to serve as Commander-in-Chief. <span style="font-weight: bold">That list includes his entire chain of command -- every single officer Kerry served under in Vietnam.</span> The Kerry game plan is to ignore all this and pretend that the 13 veterans his campaign jets around the country and puts up in 5-star hotels really represent the truth about his short, controversial combat tour.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">The Swift boats fought in groups, so the other OICs who fought alongside Kerry know him well and can accurately describe what he did and did not do.</span> In many cases Kerry's fellow OICs had a better perspective than his own crew members, since the latter had no way to determine whether he was following orders and how well he worked with his peers.

<br />
Bottom line - - the devenses by the Kerry camp so far are very weak protestations and misdirections... which tells me that that's either all they have in the way of a defense, or haven't had time to try to properly smear these "fellow brothers in arms." 
<br />

<br />
I expect the smear campaign will start this weekend. We'll hear details about their lives since vietnam that will be intended to discredit them, you watch. But it won't ever be able to refute the basic facts, and Kerry will continue to refuse to release the REST of his military records - - including the ones that he posted and then removed when they turned out to support the case against him. He has repeatedly refused to provide the same level of documentary support of his record that Bush did during the bogus "AWOL" flap (created and supported by the Dems and NOT condemned by Kerry). Kerry continues to release only part of his records, and refuses to authorize the release of the rest.
<br />

<br />
Lebuah's above posts had so many factual errors in them (I stopped counting at 8 )  that they can't even be addressed; so they'll be ignored. Though the panicked tone evidenced by the huge generalizations is pretty satisfying.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<br />
It would seem that turn-about is not fair play, at least in the Democratic Party.
<br />

<br />
Recently an organization of Vietnam veterans released a commercial that raised questions with respect to the validity of John Kerry’s service medals. Swift Boat Veterans for Truth is an organization of more than 250 Vietnam Veterans – many of whom were wounded or highly decorated – that served on swift boats during the Vietnam War. Many of the veterans affiliated with Swift Boat Veterans for Truth crossed paths with John Kerry during his self-inflicted four-months of duty in Vietnam and many of them are of the opinion that John Kerry is far from being Commander in Chief material.
<br />

<br />
In the commercial ad people who were there, some who served and completed one and sometimes two tours of duty, some who interacted with John Kerry during his “glory days,” step up to the plate and tell it as they see it is. They leave the beating around the bush for the Kerry campaign and come straight out and say they believe John Kerry has not been truthful about his service, that based on the quality of his service he cannot be trusted and they go on to refute the circumstances of how John Kerry acquired his ribbons, medals and whatever else Kerry wants to call the commendations he received during his abbreviated military career. 
<br />

<br />
Make no mistake the McAlli-nistas are not happy. They came out with a blistering rebuttal that included a charge linking the Republican Party to the release of the ad. Sadly, as is often the case, the Kerry campaign is completely wrong. <span style="font-weight: bold">Neither the Bush campaign nor the Republican National Committee has anything to do with the ad. It was produced and paid for by the organization of Vietnam veterans known today as Swift Boat Veterans for Truth.</span>
<br />

<br />
In addition, and surprisingly so, some in the conservative circles are infuriated about the ad. They call it dangerous and stupid. Among the dissenters read Bill O’Reilly, Charles Krauthammer and Dick Morris. They say the ad is a baseless attack on Kerry’s honorable military career. But how are we to be sure Kerry’s service was honorable when questions from those who have earned the right to make such allegations exist?
<br />

<br />
What really should be absolutely stunning to the American people is the fact that Kerry’s campaign is taking such offense at the charge of deceit. Why should it be so outrageous that some organization should dare to call John Kerry the Vietnam War Hero, a liar? The Kerry campaign and its surrogates didn’t blink an eye before calling President Bush a liar and there was a mountain of evidence that Bush had never lied. One could argue that believing George W. Bush lied to the American people in pursuit of Iraqi oil is almost a prerequisite to being on the Kerry campaign staff. But make the assertion when it comes to John Kerry, war action figure who can’t throw a baseball, who doesn’t release his military medical records in total and watch out!
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Predictably, the mainstream media will cry foul while coddling the crying child that is the Kerry campaign. They will heap shame upon those who would be so cruel to brave, brave Winter Soldier Johnny, and after all he did to preserve freedom for our country.</span>
<br />

<br />
But one better than kissing the skinned knee of the Kerry campaign, the mainstream media could inject themselves into the process just as they did during Watergate. <span style="font-weight: bold">Why not set the wannabe investigative reporters of The Fifth Column on the matter? Why not get to the bottom of this issue once and for all?</span> If the Kerry campaign has nothing to fear, nothing to hide, the investigation into these allegations would only help to bolster his war hero status and he would be in receipt of that elusive bump in the polls he was surely “cheated out of” after the Democratic National Convention. <span style="font-weight: bold">But each moment Kerry and his handlers deflect, each finger that they point, each accusation they make only serves to create an of air suspicion and with the polls so close, and Kerry making Vietnam the cornerstone of his electability, he can hardly opt for the wrong choice in this matter.</span>
<br />

<br />
We need to know if Lt. Com. Louis Letson, the medical officer who treated Kerry for his first injury resulting in a Purple Heart, is correct in his claim that the wound didn’t warrant the commendation. We need to know if Gunners Mate 2nd Class Van Odell, a man who insists he was present when Kerry’s action allegedly warranted him his Bronze Star, is correct when he contends that Kerry lied to get that honor. We need to know if Rear Admiral Roy Hoffman, the recipient of a Distinguished Service Medal and a Silver Star, is correct when he says John Kerry is unfit to be Commander in Chief. We not only need to know, we deserve to know.
<br />

<br />
We could listen to the he-said-she-said game of tit-for-tat that politicians like to play when they don’t want to answer specific questions. We could listen to Terry McAuliffe, James Carville, Bill Clinton and the rest of the Leftinista say that this attack was a creation of the GOP – undoubtedly Ted Kennedy will blame it on the Crawford Cabal – but, as Kerry likes to say, simply saying something isn’t so doesn’t prove anything.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">This time around John Kerry should have to face the real heat of the intrusive American media and the mainstream media should obligate itself to hold Kerry’s feet to the fire. After all, it doesn’t matter whose blood is spilled just as long as the scandal bleeds long enough to sell papers, right?</span>
<br />

<br />
These accusations need to either be validated so the American people can dodge a bullet (no pun intended) or they need to be put to bed as slanderous rumors. <span style="font-weight: bold">This time the American people deserve more than flip-flopping and arrogance. This time we deserve the truth.</span> </td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody">

<br />
Mr. Salvato once again sums up my thought process far better than I could. As he, and Grunthos have both written, why deflect and misdirect when you can go for factual debunking? Why does the DNC threaten TV stations with "possible slander" instead of investigating the charges themselves? If the mainstream media and the pundits were fair, why wouldn't they bull-dog Kerry's records with the same ferocity they got Bush to release pay-stubs, dental records, and every other scrap of paper related to his Guard duty?
<br />

<br />
If SBVfT are lying...prove it.
<br />
If the Dubyah team secretly funded the effort...prove it.
<br />

<br />
Bottom line...let's get some truth on this. I am inclined to believe O'Neill simply because I have met more self-important, arrogant, weasel officers than I can count while in the Navy. I had a navigator who put himself in for a Defense Meritorious Service Medal because an electronics tech in the Navigation department installed a new VCR and stereo in the crew's mess. And yes, he did get that medal, and the enlisted guy who did it got a 2 day special liberty pass. My point is that I would believe that Kerry, and probably a a fair number of other officers at the time, got all sorts of ridiculous accolades simply because they wrote their own paperwork. 
<br />

<br />
But let's get to investigating it with the same zeal we pick apart Dubyah. Let's have the 30 year old DUI drug before the public in the most microscopic detail. Let's talk about grades at Yale, since Dubyah's were better than Kerry's. Let's dredge up Tuh-Ray-Suh's past all the way to her early twenties, since we did that with Laura Bush. Like Salvato, I want equal intrusion under the media law.
<br />

<br />
And if Kerry can speak before the Senate in 1971 and condemn an entire military, very few of whom "were on teh boat at teh same exact timez0r!!111!!" then why is it so dastardly that this same group of men he condemned cannot defend themselves against the accusations, and further, accuse the accuser himself? 
<br />

<br />
Classic liberal double-standard. Kerry makes atrocity, murder and dishonorable conduct accusations at an entire military and is not corraborated by anything other than My Lai footage, and he's a hero. Yet people with first hand knowledge of Kerry say he isn't telling the truth and they are demons from the pits of GOP hell who club seals and eat children.

Somebody shove a new battery up Bob Woodward's spincty... isn't this supposed to be his purpose in life?

<br />
By Michael Kranish, Globe Staff  |  August 6, 2004
<br />

<br />
WASHINGTON -- A week after Senator John F. Kerry heralded his wartime experience by surrounding himself at the Democratic convention with his Vietnam ''Band of Brothers," a separate group of veterans has launched a television ad campaign and a book that questions the basis for some of Kerry's combat medals.
<br />

<br />
But yesterday, a key figure in the anti-Kerry campaign, Kerry's former commanding officer, backed off one of the key contentions. Lieutenant Commander George Elliott said in an interview that he had made a ''terrible mistake" in signing an affidavit that suggests Kerry did not deserve the Silver Star -- one of the main allegations in the book. The affidavit was given to The Boston Globe by the anti-Kerry group to justify assertions in their ad and book.
<br />

<br />
Elliott is quoted as saying that Kerry ''lied about what occurred in Vietnam . . . for example, in connection with his Silver Star, I was never informed that he had simply shot a wounded, fleeing Viet Cong in the back."
<br />

<br />
The statement refers to an episode in which Kerry killed a Viet Cong soldier who had been carrying a rocket launcher, part of a chain of events that formed the basis of his Silver Star. Over time, some Kerry critics have questioned whether the soldier posed a danger to Kerry's crew. Crew members have said Kerry's actions saved their lives.
<br />

<br />
Yesterday, reached at his home, Elliott said he regretted signing the affidavit and said he still thinks Kerry deserved the Silver Star.
<br />

<br />
''I still don't think he shot the guy in the back," Elliott said. ''It was a terrible mistake probably for me to sign the affidavit with those words. I'm the one in trouble here."
<br />

<br />
Elliott said he was no under personal or political pressure to sign the statement, but he did feel ''time pressure" from those involved in the book. ''That's no excuse," Elliott said. ''I knew it was wrong . . . In a hurry I signed it and faxed it back. That was a mistake."
<br />

<br />
The affidavit also contradicted earlier statements by Elliott, who came to Boston during Kerry's 1996 Senate campaign to defend Kerry on similar charges, saying that Kerry acted properly and deserved the Silver Star.
<br />

<br />
The book, ''Unfit for Command: Swift Boat Veterans Speak Out Against John Kerry," is to be published next week. Yesterday it reached number one on the bestseller list on Amazon.com, based on advance orders, in part because of publicity about it on the Drudge Report.
<br />

<br />
The book seeks to undermine one of the central claims of Kerry's campaign -- that his Vietnam War heroism would make him a good commander in chief.
<br />

<br />
While the Regnery Publishing yesterday declined to release an advance copy of the book, Drudge's website quotes it as saying, ''Elliott indicates that a Silver Star recommendation would not have been made by him had he been aware of the actual facts."
<br />

<br />
Meanwhile, a television advertising campaign began yesterday featuring many of the anti-Kerry veterans who are quoted in the book, including Elliott. In the ad, Elliott says, ''John Kerry has not been honest about what happened in Vietnam."
<br />

<br />
Asked to supply evidence to support that statement, the anti-Kerry group provided a copy of Elliott's affidavit. Elliott said the same affidavit had been used in the production of the book.
<br />

<br />
It is unclear whether the work contains further justification for the assertion, beyond Elliott's statement.
<br />

<br />
Kerry won the Silver Star for his action on Feb. 28, 1969, in which he shot a Viet Cong soldier who had been carrying a rocket launcher and running toward a hut. All of Kerry's crewmates who participated and are still living said in interviews last year that the action was necessary and appropriate, and it was Elliott who recommended Kerry for the Silver Star.
<br />

<br />
In an interview for a seven-part biographical series that appeared in the Globe last year, Kerry said: ''I don't have a second's question" about killing the Viet Cong. ''He was running away with a live B-40, and, I thought, poised to turn around and fire it."
<br />

<br />
Asked whether that meant that he had shot the guerrilla in the back, Kerry said, ''No, absolutely not," adding that the enemy had been running to a hut for cover, where he could have destroyed Kerry's boat and killed the crew.
<br />

<br />
The forthcoming book is coauthored by Jerome R. Corsi and John O'Neill, a former Vietnam naval officer who in 1971 debated Kerry on the Dick Cavett show, challenging Kerry's assertion that US atrocities had been widespread in Vietnam. O'Neill met with then-President Richard M. Nixon for an hour before debating Kerry, and his efforts were encouraged by Nixon's aides.
<br />

<br />
O'Neill could not be reached for comment yesterday. President Bush's campaign denied working with O'Neill on the book or with the producers of the television advertisement.
<br />

<br />
Meanwhile, Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, urged Bush yesterday to disassociate himself from what he called a ''dishonest and dishonorable" attack. In response, the White House spokesman, Scott McClellan, said, ''We have not and we will not question Senator Kerry's service in Vietnam."
<br />

<br />
The Associated Press reported yesterday that Houston home-builder Bob J. Perry, a major Republican donor, gave at least $100,000 to the organization sponsoring the ad, Swift Boat Veterans for Truth.
<br />

<br />
The Kerry campaign spokesman, Michael Meehan, said none of those in the ad had served on a boat with Kerry. ''Some of these men defended John Kerry's honor on his military record in 1996 and so they were either lying then or lying now," Meehan said. ''Either way, it is gutter politics."
<br />

<br />
The book also raises questions about the action of March 13, 1969, for which Kerry was awarded a Bronze Star and his third Purple Heart, according to an advance chapter of the book.
<br />

<br />
The anti-Kerry group provided three affidavits from veterans on nearby boats questioning aspects of the award.
<br />

<br />
On that day, Kerry rescued James Rassmann, who went overboard as a result of an explosion. Rassmann appeared by Kerry's side during the Iowa caucus campaign and at last week's Democratic National Convention, telling the story of how Kerry pulled him out of the water while his boat was under fire.
<br />

<br />
As in the case of the Silver Star, it was Elliott who recommended Kerry for the Bronze Star. According to the recommendation signed by Elliott, a mine exploded under a boat accompanying Kerry's craft.
<br />

<br />
''Almost simultaneously, another mine detonated close aboard [Kerry's] PCF-94, knocking First Lieutenant Rassman [sic] into the water and wounding Lt. JG Kerry in the right arm."
<br />

<br />
Elliott then described how Kerry ''managed to pull Lt. Rassman aboard despite the painful wound in his right arm." Elliott concluded that Kerry had been ''calm, professional, and highly courageous in the face of enemy fire."
<br />

<br />
Elliott, in the interview yesterday, said that based on the affidavits of the veterans on other boats, he now thinks his assessment about the Bronze Star and third Purple Heart may have been based on poor information.
<br />

<br />
In one affidavit, for example, Van O'Dell, who said he had been in a boat near Kerry on that day, declared that Kerry had ''lied" about what happened on that day and said that Rassmann was not under enemy fire when Kerry pulled him aboard.
<br />

<br />
Elliott, asked about the contradiction between his recommendation and his new questioning of Kerry's third Purple Heart, responded, ''It makes me look kind of silly, to be perfectly honest."
<br />

<br />
But he said: ''I simply have no reason for these guys to be lying, and if they are lying in concert, it is one hell of a conspiracy. So, on the basis of all of the information that has come out, I have chosen to believe the other men. I absolutely do not know first hand."
<br />

<br />
Naval documents said that Kerry ''received shrapnel wounds in left buttocks and contusions on right forearm when a mine detonated close to PCF 94 while engaged in operations on river. Condition and prognosis excellent. Result of hostile action."
<br />

<br />
Rassmann, reached by telephone yesterday, said he has never had any question that Kerry deserved the Purple Heart. He said there were two separate events: One was earlier in the day, when he and Kerry blew up a rice cache, and the explosion caused some of the rice to hit Kerry, and perhaps some weapon fragments as well. The second involved a mine explosion as Kerry and Rassmann were on patrol. The explosion, Rassmann said, knocked him overboard and threw Kerry against the pilot house, injuring his arm.
<br />

<br />
Rassmann said that he has always believed that Kerry got the third Purple Heart solely for the injury to his arm as a result of the explosion in the water.
<br />

<br />
''If he got fragments in the buttocks due to the mine, that is new information to me," Rassmann said.
<br />

<br />
''I would say there is confusion. Maybe they did lump it together. It was my understanding he got it for the wound being thrown across the pilot house."
<br />

<br />
Either way, Rassmann said, Kerry deserved the third Purple Heart because such awards are given for injuries incurred in combat, and Kerry's arm injury qualified. He also stood by his recollection that he was under fire when rescued by Kerry.
<br />

<br />
Those questioning Kerry's medals, Rassmann said, are ''angry about John speaking out against the [Vietnam] war."

Then they saw a young viet Cong pop out with a rocket launcher and they had no way of knowing if that launcher was loaded or not.  SO the gunner shot the kid in the leg with the M-60.  Then the boy ran (as best as he could with an M-60 wound to the leg) at which time he was chased down and shot.  I have no problem with any of that other than I don't think that action deserved a silver star.  If it did then there would have been a hell of a lot more silver stars handed out making the award meaningless.

The following statement from Swift Boat Veterans for Truth concerns an article appearing in morning edition of the BOSTON GLOBE, written by GLOBE reporter and author of the official Kerry-Edwards campaign book, Mike Kranish. 
<br />

<br />
"Captain George Elliott describes an article appearing in today’s edition of the BOSTON GLOBE by Mike Kranish as extremely inaccurate and highly misstating his actual views. He reaffirms his statement in the current advertisement paid for by the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, Captain Elliott reaffirms his affidavit in support of that advertisement, and he reaffirms his request that the ad be played. 
<br />

<br />
“Additional documentation will follow. 
<br />

<br />
"The article by Mr. Kranish is particularly surprising given page 102 of Mr. Kranish’s own book quoting John Kerry as acknowledging that he killed a single, wounded, fleeing Viet Cong soldier whom he was afraid would turn around. 
<br />

<br />
"Swift Boat Veterans for Truth has more than 250 supporters who are revealing first hand, eyewitness accounts of numerous incidents concerning John Kerry’s military service record. The organization will continue to discuss much of what John Kerry has reported as fact concerning his four-month tour of duty in Vietnam."

Another interesting note is the Author of this Boston Globe article which Elliot says is inaccurate also wrote the forward for the Kerry/Edwards campaign book.

BTW, there's no military restriction against back-shooting a fleeing enemy who's STILL ARMED. That's horse-opera BS.

however, Kerry's inability to admit the obvious (that he had to shoot the guy in the back, unless he knifed him there instead) because it would make him look 'bad' to some people, is just more evidence that he lies for convenience and to pretty up his reputation, ain't it?

BOSTON GLOBE 'REPORTER' COMMISSIONED TO WRITE OFFICIAL CAMPAIGN BOOK FOREWORD -- WHILE COVERING KERRY
<br />

<br />
BOSTON GLOBE journalist Mike Kranish has been commissioned to write the foreword of the Kerry-Edwards campaign book -- just as he is covering the campaign in an official capacity as a journalist for the BOSTON GLOBE! 
<br />

<br />
Kranish made waves on Friday by reporting in the GLOBE how a key figure in the anti-Kerry vet ad campaign, Kerry's former commanding officer, "backed off one of the key contentions."
<br />

<br />
But Captain George Elliott claims the Kranish article is "extremely inaccurate" and highly misstated his actual views.

<br />
By Susan Milligan, Globe Staff  |  August 7, 2004
<br />

<br />
WASHINGTON -- A report that one of a group of veterans opposing Senator John F. Kerry's bid for the presidency had said he made a mistake signing an affidavit questioning Kerry's medals rocketed around the airwaves yesterday, sparking a backlash on conservative radio programs and the Drudge Report website.
<br />

<br />
The programs asserted that retired Lieutenant Commander George Elliott had been misquoted in yesterday's Boston Globe when he said he had made a "terrible mistake" in signing an affidavit suggesting Kerry did not deserve to be awarded the Silver Star. Kerry was awarded the medal for killing a Viet Cong soldier.
<br />

<br />
The Globe quoted Elliott, who was Kerry's commanding officer during the war, as saying he was under "time pressure" when he signed the document and still believes Kerry deserved the Silver Star for his service. The affidavit was released ahead of the publication of a new book that questions whether Kerry should have been given some of his combat medals.
<br />

<br />
Elliott released another affidavit yesterday backing away from his comments this week to the Globe, saying the reporter, Michael Kranish, misquoted him.
<br />

<br />
Globe Editor Martin Baron released a statement saying "the Globe stands by the article. The quotes attributed to Mr. Elliott were on the record and absolutely accurate."
<br />

<br />
In 1996, when Kerry was running for Senate reelection and faced questions about the circumstances in which he shot the Viet Cong fighter, Elliott came to Boston and defended Kerry, saying he deserved the Silver Star.
<br />

<br />
In yesterday's new affidavit, Elliott said, "had I known the facts I would not have recommended Kerry for the Silver Star simply for pursuing and dispatching a single wounded Viet Cong." He added, "I do not claim to have any personal knowledge as to how Kerry shot the wounded, fleeing Viet Cong."
<br />

<br />
At the same time, Drudge also erroneously reported that Kranish, a 20-year Globe veteran, had written the introduction to a Kerry-authorized campaign book, "Our Plan for America: Stronger at Home, Respected in the World."
<br />

<br />
In fact, Baron said, Kranish had no connection to the Kerry campaign book and did not write its introduction.
<br />

<br />
Baron noted that earlier this summer Kranish worked with PublicAffairs -- the publisher of the Boston Globe biography of Kerry, "John F. Kerry: The Complete Biography by the Boston Globe Reporters Who Know Him Best" -- to write a short introduction to a second project: an independent, unauthorized review of publicly available documents dealing with the platform and policy statements of Kerry and Edwards. That project was in no way connected with the Kerry-Edwards campaign, Baron said.
<br />

<br />
"When PublicAffairs subsequently struck an agreement with the Kerry campaign to do an official campaign book, Kranish's relationship with the project immediately ended," Baron said.
<br />

<br />
Peter Osnos, publisher of PublicAffairs, said both Drudge and Amazon, the online bookseller peddling the upcoming Kerry-Edwards book, had made a mistake in suggesting Kranish had written its introduction.
<br />

<br />
"As far as I can tell, if there's any malign intent here, it was someone making Drudge think Michael was somehow doing something for [Kerry's] campaign," Osnos said.
<br />

<br />
The Globe book, "John F. Kerry: The Complete Biography," is an unauthorized biography. The work draws on extensive interviews with the candidate, all conducted before 2004. After he emerged as the presumptive Democratic nominee, Kerry declined to cooperate with further interviews.
<br />

<br />
Amazon, the online bookseller, apparently contributed to the confusion with a listing for the Kerry-approved campaign book indicating Kranish as the author. PublicAffairs' officials said yesterday that Amazon had agreed to revise the listing immediately.
<br />

<br />
Kerry campaign spokesman Michael Meehan said Kranish had no connection to the campaign.

Just heads up, I read today that they democrats have created what they call the brown book on these vets.  They are digging up everything from military records to health records to criminal records to credit histories on these guys.
