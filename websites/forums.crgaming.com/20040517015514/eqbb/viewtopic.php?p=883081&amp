<br />

<br />
Initiall it was believed WoM was a set duration of 1 tic based on the server clock (so depending on when it landed, it could last anywhere from 6 - 11 seconds)
<br />

<br />
Now however, we see WOM landing on multiple mobs at the same time, but wearing off at different times.
<br />

<br />
At the moment it looks like  WoM's duration isn't just based just on when it lands otherwise we should see them all wearing off at the same time, there's something else at play here.  Is it distance maybe?  Did the mobs closest to you have WOM wear off first or did you notice?

I know I'm derailing this a bit, but this is just something I've never noticed before</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">I've have never done a test like this before with WoM so I don't know how the timing worked before I recieved Mesmerization Mastery.  I had always heard that WoM was a set 1 Tick in duration and have always simply accepted that.  Since I already have the AA now someone else may be willing to go back and test it without the AA.
<br />

<br />
When I did the test I tashed to gather all the mobs near me.  I simply waited until I had 10 and then began casting WoM.  As a result all mobs were within their chosen melee range.  As always some were closer then others.  I did not take time to notice if the ones that wore off later were closer or further from me.  However, neither I nor they moved at all once the test began.  I did look back later and noticed that the wear off times are not "exactly" the same duration.  If distance were a factor then all other things being equal I would have expected all the wear off times to match exactly.  This is not the case.  Sometimes 3 mobs break after "X" number of seconds and sometimes 2 and sometimes 1. 
<br />

<br />
It did find it odd though that their seemed to always be at least one that lasted 12 seconds and at least one that lasted 17.  If it was purely random I would have expected to every once in awhile have a more wildly random mix of wear off times.  For the most part the wear off times appear oddly uniform.  I would expect this if averaging them all together but it appeared to be uniform EACH time.  Not just overall.
<br />

<br />
In hind sight I wish I had used a larger sample but realistically it won't matter much to my gameplay no matter how it works.  If all I can count on for sure is a 12 second duration then that is all I will ever expect and will play accordingly.  Makes me curious though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">Originally WOM was said to be 1 tic in duration, and the tic itself was timed by the server side clock.  So depending on when WOM actually landed, you would see it last anywhere from 6 - 11 seconds.  (for example, a tic could be programmed to start at 12:00 sharp, the next tic would be at 12:06, etc.   If you landed WOM at 12:03, the tic wouldn't actually start until 12:06 and it would last until 12:12 - so there you would have a 9 second WOM)
<br />

<br />
Off of the top of my head what the different wear off times indicate to me is that the time or tics are not set by the server afterall - nor by our own clocks either.  It's something coded....   maybe..  hmm I don't know - will have to think more on this when I have some time.
<br />

<br />
Also I did not buy MM yet, so if I can I'll test WOM tonight and see what happens</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>
