				<td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">To the people who rant about Verant and SOE:
<br />

<br />
If you happen to live in the United States of America, and if you happen to have any education at all, you will realize that the U.S.A has a constitution that makes sure the government does not treat citizens unfairly. In other words, the president of the U.S. cannot be a dictator and everyone has a right to vote in order to ensure their rights are protected. Also, congress is elected directly by the people, therefore, they make laws which represent our interests. 
<br />

<br />
Now, if you happen to own Everquest and if you happen to also play Everquest, then you pay money each month so Verant will supply you with Everquest. But, Verant does not have a constitution. And likewise, Norrath does not have a constitution. Therefore Verant or Norrath does not have to listen to you or do anything you say. They are like a little government of their own. They can do whatever they want with their product and they can charge whatever they want for their product.  Verant is the dictator/tyrrant of Norrath and by paying them, you submit to their tyranny. The up side to this is: you don't have to pay them. No one makes you play Everquest. If you don't like this tyranny, you don't have to submitt yourself to it! Now, the downside to this is: You won't get to play Everquest if you don't pay. But, Everquest is not a right it's a privalidge. And it's not your game, it's Verant's game. Verant Owns Everquest. It's not a democracy, for the people, and by the people, but rather a company created for the company and by the company. You are the slaves that play it, except you are really not slaves; you are free to quit at any time. 
<br />

<br />
Norrath is a world created by Verant, therefore, they own you when you play. Unless, of course, you don't pay.
<br />

<br />
Do you have a right to rant and rave about Verant? Of course, the 1st Amendment of the U.S. constitution gives you the freedom of speech. Therefore, you can say anything you want about Verant But, does Verant have to listen to you or take action when you ask them to? No!
<br />

<br />
If there is anybody to blame, it is you. You can't blame Verant. They aren't breaking any rules. You don't have to play EQ. Actually, in theory, a philosopher would probably argue that it is your duty to quit Everquest if you feel the game is treating you unfairly! 
<br />

<br />
Norrath has no set laws. The way Verant conducts it's business on a small scale tells you something about human character on a large scale. There's a reason why Verant hasn't written a constitution to govern itself by. There is a reason no company writes a permanent law book: Because, laws are for the common good. Companies aren't about the common good of the people; they are about promoting the self-interest of a small group of people. Namely, the CEO's and executives. 
<br />

<br />
When a GM doesn't respond to your petition, he or she is not breaking any rules. This may show you what kind of people you are doing business with. This may show you what kind of morals Verant has. But, is not unfair at all. There is nothing unfair about it. GMs are not wrong, you’re the one who’s wrong. You can’t expect them to do anything for you.
<br />

<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline">FOR EXAMPLE: </span>
<br />

<br />
This is one example of why some (not all) people who play Everquest are wrong in the way they think:
<br />

<br />
Let's say your "camping" the Ancient Cyclops for his ring in one of his spawning zones. And let's say you have been "camping" him for over twelve hours. Suddenly he spawns and some level 60 Wizard shows up out of no where and kills AC and takes the ring. Naturally, you would be pissed. And, the first thing you would probably think is: "Why the hell did that guy just steel my camp? That ass hole had no right to do that!" And if your like most people, you are probably going to petition a GM. When the GM answers your petition, he or she is probably not going to do anything about it. Why? Because there is no such thing as "camps" in Everquest. Camps are a player created idea. Camps don't exist. Talk to any GM and he or she will tell you camps aren't in Everquest. Why? Because Verant says they don't exist. And is Verant right for saying this? Of course, they can say whatever they want. IT IS THEIR GAME. THEY OWN EVERQUEST. A matter of fact, if you were smart, you would go steal "camps" as much as possible. After all, there is no rule against it (because they don't exist) and because you get quick cash. Stealing camps is Okay. Hmmm. Does this seem a bit odd? Sure, I bet it sounds crazy. But, its not. You are playing Verant's game. Not your game. Everquest does not have camps! Everquest will never have camps, unless Verant says it does. Your living in a fantasy of a fantasy to think for a second that camps exist. So, then you might ask: Why doesn't everyone steal camps all the time? Probably because Everquest wouldn't be fun for player if everyone did. So, the people who play Everquest decided along, long time ago that they would call spawning spots camps and that once you took a camp, it was yours until a pop came. And by doing this, it would make things happier for everyone. And, in all truth, it has made things happier. The only thing is, this player created idea of camps isn't real. It's only real in the minds of people who follow it. Of course, most people don't steal camps, in order to make the game more fun. But, in all truth, you have NO Obligation to not steal camps. The person who always steals your so called spawns is really not a bad person. They have as much right to the spawn as you! Why? Because they aren't breaking rules. Does that make it right? Yes, according to Verant it does. And that's the only opinion that matters. Why? Because you are paying them to provide you with a service that they decide the rules on. In the real world, people can't steel, but computer pixels created by Verant are owned by Verant. 
<br />

<br />
This is just one example of the flawed thought of people who play Everquest. People make up their own rules to a game that's not their own. The real rule followers are the people who steal camps, because at least they recognize the fact the camps don't exist. Odd, huh? Yep, sure is. 
<br />

<br />
If you look at history, almost every leader who is given absolute power will screw things up and be unfair. There is no difference between a lot of power and a little power. People will abuse it. The rules or policies GMs follow are not for gamers, but for the company. Policies are written to make sure companies are happy, not the customers. 
<br />

<br />
When was the last time you voted on a change that occurred in Everquest? Not anytime I can think of. Yeah, they will poll you. But, polling is to make sure they don’t make a big mistake when making changes that will make them lost customers.
<br />

<br />
If you have any self-respect or if you have any sense of value, you will realize your time is short. I quit Everquest at about the same time I started hating the company that created it. I quit it because I knew I couldn't change it and I knew I could quit. No one forces you to play.
<br />

<br />
For those of you who have no complaints about Everquest, enjoy Norrath and keep playing. But, don't expect things to change because you want them to. Things in Everquest change because SOE or Verant wants them to. They are a business. They play by the rules of business. They aren’t unfair. They are simply offering you a service. 
<br />

<br />
If you think my argument is stupid or void, then try to prove me wrong. I don't want words, I want action. If you can make Verant balance the classes it has long since screwed and change some of it's flawed rules, then you have proved me wrong and Verant is indeed ruled by the players. 
<br />

I can only think of one reason you actually wrote this, and that is you are trying to make yourelf feel good for KS'ing someone's AC.

WOW .. you really made me think ... quite an impressive line of reasoning .. and its basically all true ! 
<br />

<br />
Indeed you have inspired rage in me, however sad it may seem, I will head home tonight, and play EQ. and conintue to respect the unwritten laws of common courtesy agreed upon by most of the user community. 
<br />

<br />
Lets face it, If we lived in a Dictator socoiety in which murder was legal, it would make it no less immoral to murder someone. And I still will get just as mad at that person who steals my spawn, even though I will realize there is nothing i can do. 
<br />

<br />
Just because the "owners' of this world have no respect for these rules, doesnt mean we as individuals cannot rise above it and be good to each other. No one forces us to play true, but no one forces you be be ruude to your fellow Norrathians either it is a choice.

The purpose of my post was to tell the people who whine about Verant to stop whining. And to point out just one example of why many people in Everquest have a flawed way of viewing the rules of the game, as if they have any right to make rules. 
<br />

<br />
I understand that people do rise above the dictatorship and lame rules of Verant to make the game more fun. But, this does not lessen the fact that your rules are not the ones of Everquest.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

If you had basic education you would have known that. Companies try to please the people, and make a profit at the same time. Sure, they can do what ever they feel like, but they wouldn't make as much money as they would if they did what the people want. I think Verant does listen to the players, and i think they do change things based on popular opinion. And i'd like to comment on how you said "Stealing camps is Okay." I guess that's just an opinion but i think most people would agree with me in saying that Stealing camps is not good. It's all a matter of common decency. Say if there was no law in the real world saying that you couldn't rob people and steal from stores. I get the feeling that you would do it anyways because you have no morals. You know what morals are right? It's that gut feeling you get when you do something bad or good, and you feel bad or good for doing it. Most of us live life based on our morals. I think you did us a good thing by just leaving EQ for people that are less hatefull.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

I agree. I don't know where I said the contrary to that in my original post. But, this still doesn't take away from the fact that Verant only changes things so they can make more money, not because they actually care whole-heartedly what players think.

<br />

<br />
I respond:
<br />
1) Stealing camps is okay, and it's not an opinion, it's a fact. We are not arguing based on Morals Preterhuman; we are arguing based on what the Verant rule book says. The Verant rule book happens to disregard the idea of camps, therefore stealing them is not an issue and therefore cannot possibly be wrong. So, please try to use valid arguments.
<br />

<br />
Now if you want to argue morally, then we would both agree. I happen to believe kill stealing and "camp" stealing is wrong, but I happen to know morals are not what dictate the rules Verant puts down. Lets try to focus on the issue at hand, shall we? This is not a moral debate.
<br />

<br />
and you also said:
<br />

It's all a matter of common decency. Say if there was no law in the real world saying that you couldn't rob people and steal from stores. I get the feeling that you would do it anyways because you have no morals.</td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
1) This argument of yours is attacking me personally! What a low thing to do in an argument, especially if you don't know what my morals are. You have no educated right to tell me what I would or would not do. Especially in this case, because I specified in a recent post on this topic that I have never stolen a camp. Just because you don't want to face the facts of my contentions doesn't mean you have to attack my integrity. 
<br />

<br />
Lastly, you used a very home made definition of morals. Morals are not "that gut feeling you get when you do something bad or good, and you feel bad or good for doing it." Your definition of morals fits more properly with the word Conscience.
<br />

<br />
I see morals as a an ability to see the difference between right and wrong and make judgements based on that view. Then again, the dictionary probably says something different.
<br />

<br />
Finally, you said:

<br />

<br />
Despite the grammatical errors in the structure of this sentence, you are attacking me again. This argument isn't about me. Also, I am not hateful. I don't know where you got that. I never even used the word hate in my original post that I can remember nor did I say anything that targeted any one person or one group of individuals in a hatefull manner. I simply pointed out facts about the rules of Everquest. If you think camp stealing is hateful, then complain to Verant, NOT ME.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

I read back and nowhere does he ever even insinuate that he condones or practicies Camp Stealing.

He makes a great arugment for why Verant seems to condone, (or at least facilate) an environment where camp stealing is perfectly acceptable.

It seems to me more of a cynacil (and quite clever) stab at Verant, and those who incessantly whine about something they (Verant) care nothing about.

<br />

<br />
and i do feel for Stradivex, there is no reason for flaming here. there are so many people challenged by higher level thinking, that they simply misunderstood what your saying, its ok, u cant change that either, its the Law of Man.
<br />

<br />
but about how Verant doesn't change things for the people, i also agree, especially since i played as a PALADIN for my first main.  i always love playing as the "HOLY KNIGHT OF JUSTICE character, but they just suck and they been sucking forever.  i, a high school senior can devise logical balancing issues for paladins that grown adults of SOE and verant cannot, its ridiculous.
<br />
for one, paladins being 1/3 cleric, just make all their heals 1/3 as strong.  whats wrong with that? people always complain about there not being enough clerics around.  and clerics will still be greatly needed since they heal 3 times more then paladins in a course of battle.  paladins already suck bad in dealing damage and tanking compared to warriors.  basically we suck at everythign except fighting undead, which is only 10% of norrath.
<br />

<br />
i've quit EQ before, but i'm planning on coming back, playing as a monk, a class GREATLY MORE appreciated compared to a paladin.
<br />

<br />
on the issue of camp stealing an such, i have never been strong enough to camp long hours, and i never would with my schedules n such (was only lvl 30+ when i left), but in the role playing world, there are supposed to be evil characters, people that just annoy the good guys.  well, there should be, but the problem is that when there is evil there is usually a way to fight it, but in a non-PvP server, thats impossible.  its just realistic, thats what people strive for in EQ, thats why there are such things as camping for 12 hours in the first place, for realism.  so i guess, if you lik the realism of the camping system, u should have to deal with the realism of the "people doign what they want" system. wait, thats right, the camp-stealers are just doign what they want, the same thign as the campers, just one takes a different approach.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="icon_confused.gif" border="0" /></span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

The reason why i attacked your morals is because you said "The person who always steals your so called spawns is really not a bad person." Just because Verant says it's not against the rules, by no means, makes it a good thing to do. Maybe it's not you who is saying this, and if it isn't i apologize, but it does sound like you are saying that if Verant says it's ok, then it's ok. I think morals and your conscience go hand in hand. But that is just me. I believe that when you are doing something wrong, your conscience tells you that you are doing something wrong. You said morals are an "ability to see the difference between right and wrong and make judgements based on that view." Doesn't your conscience do that as well? Camp Stealing is wrong, it is not okay no matter how you look at it. You can't say it is ok just because Verant doesn't have a rule against it, that still doesn't automatically make it ok.
