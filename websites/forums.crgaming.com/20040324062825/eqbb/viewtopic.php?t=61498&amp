                                            The Many Misadventures of Fry
<br />
---------------------------------
<br />
Chapter 1 Fry, the thief.....er scout..
<br />

<br />
It was a dark and stormy night as many a tale begins. My beloved husband snuck through the hallowed halls of Felwithe his prize at hand, easily bypassing the guards and security measures, at only the tender age of 14. Which is very young, especially for an elf. Who's lifespan is measured in centuries, not decades like the humans that are likely to read this biography.
<br />

<br />
Well, I suppose I am jumping ahead of things aren't I? I guess I should let you in a on few details on the life of my husband and maybe if I feel like it a little about myself.
<br />

<br />
My husband, if you haven't guessed already is Fry as he likes to be called, though his birth name is Frydious Angus-Bilbao Menlore..though you can see why he just likes to be called Fry..his parents must have had some really good evergreen leaves when they named him..but I am wandering again. Well, to start things off Fry was one bedazzled and trained in the arts of theivery or also known as the roguish arts. Everyone, just like everyone else who weren't of his guild and specialty called him exactly that a rogue and theif, hm I can hear him now screaming to the heavans that he was not a rogue, he was Scout. A scout of the Goddess Tunare! Proud defender of Faydwer,  and scourge of evil.....though he just tended to blow up stuff and get chassed by Orcs and Brownies...but if you think about it , it's almost the same isn't it? Well, I am jumping ahead again..
<br />

<br />

<br />
Let's see what is a good way to start....o yeah silly me, more about Fry. You see Fry was the son of Augustas Menlore a powerful Geomancer and Mariea Ali, one of Kelethin's scouts. Sadly though one day when Fry was only 6, his father disappeared..some say he was killed, some say he abandoned Mariea and Fry, but who really knows but him. Because of that Fry grew up in the company of rogues...scouts and like his mother sought to become a legend amoung the guild. He spent every waking moment learning eerything he could, honing his skills and masterng them. And at the tender age of 14 breaking al kinds of records, was given a test of passing.
<br />

<br />
Now as the name sounds, this test was designed to ensure only the best students, would become full members of the Scout's guild and learn the guarded secrets of Scouting. Because of his natural prowess, Young Fry was given the hardest Test everr given, he was to break into Felwithe Castle and remove 1 item of worth from the royal quarters. Simply put, he had to get past, the most heavily defended area in the known world and steal something from either the King's, the Queen's or the Princess's room. Not an easy task for any one, even for Fry. So to make it somewhat more fair and to test another student who was breaking records, Fry was partnered with a girl 2 years his senior by the name of Reverdone Moocienaga Dal Kampo Ciba or Rev for short...I think Fry's and Rev's parents shared the same stash..but any way I am drifting..
<br />
-------------------------------------
<br />

<br />

<br />
Smothered in the shadows, Fry peers out from the Guard Tower across the town square, looking for the best point of entry into Felwithe Castle. He sighed, he tiring of waiing on Rev, she was so slow when it came to scaling walls.
<br />

<br />
He gazed up at the stars and began to drift away, hewa kind of tired, i had been a really long week with all of the tests, but soon it will be all over. Soon he will ba ful member of the Scout's of Tunare. He will get his Cape and seal and he will be shown the guild's secret skills and most importantly, the secrets of tracking. Maybe finally armed with that knowledge, he could fnd Pop. Finally,he would know why he leftso suddenly....why he left Mo-
<br />

<br />
Ahand touched his shoulder.
<br />

<br />
"Fry."
<br />

<br />
"AAAAHH!!" He shouted nearly jumping out of his skin. "Don't do that Rev!"
<br />

<br />
The young Wood Elf girl scooted up beside him and crouched upon thee tower edge, giving him a quick smile. 
<br />

<br />
"You are such a scardy-cat Fry." SHe giggled and brushed her flowing hair back bit, in doing so she released a bit of even from Fry. As she reached up, she inadvertently moved er cloak, reveaing her Scout knife. He envied that so, he wanted a Scout Knife also and he would have had it f it weren't for his reluctance in combat. Not to say that he was a poorly skilled fighter, even his Guildmaster had to admit that Fry was rapidly becoming better he was. It was just that Fry could never, no matter the circumstances or the imagined scenarios given to him by his teachers, could he strike what would be a fatal blow. It was because of that, he would never get a scout's knife, the Scout symbol of absolute deadliness.
<br />

<br />
He quickly pushed that thought aside, and focused back onthe mission. 
<br />

<br />
"Let's go" He pulled his cloak back over him and leapt of the high guard tower. Rev mimiced him and for a few countless seconds they fell down and down until they landed like cats upon thestraw thatchel roof of a peasant home. They both dashed forward, quickly getting up to a fast klip, dashing across the roof and then leaping to the next roof. Playing a silent game of leapfrog across the roofs of the inhabtants below.
<br />

<br />
Quickly and silently, thay made it to Felwthe castle. Where they rendevouzed once again, in the shadows just beyond the sight of the porticullis Gaurds.
<br />

<br />
Rev scanned up, and began to thread a lin through her grappling hook.
<br />

<br />
"You still use that clunky thing?"
<br />

<br />
"Yeah."
<br />

<br />
"Why not just run up like we where taught?"
<br />

<br />
"I can't do it, I keep slipping."
<br />

<br />
"How dd you pass teh climbing test?"
<br />

<br />
"Patience, a friend and 30 platinum coins." she beamed
<br />

<br />
"Hmph.. ANy way, lets do this witha little style."
<br />

<br />
"How?"
<br />

<br />
"Straight through the front entrance?"
<br />

<br />
"How? There is nowhere to hide, to get around them. To much light." She said referring to the 15 torches spread around the entrance.
<br />

<br />
It was Fry's turn to beam. "Watch and learn, little one" He said imitating the Guild leader. He removed two throwing daggers from his utility pouch and a bottle of fluid. He quickly dipped the daggers in the fluid and then put the bottle back in the pouch. Moving away a bit to get a better angle, he lined up and then hurled the daggers at the two guards, each one striking a guard just at the seam between their plate mail armor.
<br />

<br />
The guards looked pained for a moment, then collapsed backwards and began to snore.
<br />

<br />
"What was that?"
<br />

<br />
Fry took the bottle back out and let Rev smell what was in it. She coughed and smiled a bit. "Evergreen leaf elixir"
<br />

<br />
"Yeah, when you need something great for parties and knocking out inept castle guards, I highly recommend it. Heh, they are going to wake up feeling like a million platinum. And they are going to need it too, when the King chews them out for letting us get past so easily."
<br />

<br />
"Yeah"
<br />

<br />
With out another word both of them dashed across the open field and through the portcullis and into the previously impregnable fortress Castle Felwithe. The next 15 minutes were variations of the same event, repeated dozens upon dozens of times. Whether they used a throwing dagger to disable an armored guard, or a cloth soaked in the elixir to mug an inept servant, it was all the same. In that bit of time Fry and Rev had completely incapacitated the entire eastern section of Felwithe castle. Leaving them to plunder the riches within the inner sanctum. They wouldn't even have to worry about King Tearis or his new Queen Mysonia. They were out exploring the country side alone, a sort of second honeymoon. That left only the beloved…to the general population… lovely and funny…to Rev.. snot nosed brat…to Fry… Princess Tyia, the Kings only heir, now that Fironia disappeared. She and her personal Templar protectors would be the only ones left… This time of the night though, she should be in bed sleeping soundly.
<br />

<br />
"Do you know the way to the King's room Rev?"
<br />

<br />
"No… I thought you did? This is my first time here."
<br />

<br />
"….Hmm.. I was here a couple of times before..but that was a long time ago…I haven't been back because of that stupid snot nosed brat.."
<br />

<br />
"You shouldn't talk about her like that. She is the Princess."
<br />

<br />
"…hmph I don't care who she is….she stole my fireworks…"
<br />
-----------
<br />
I guess, I should interrupt and explain this. You see as you already know, Fry's mother is one of the best scouts in the land and is frequently called on by the King. After she gave birth to Fry and was ready to go back to service she did so only for the highest of priority missions. During the time she was away, the King graciously allowed young Fry to stay in Felwithe castle under his and Lady Mysonia's supervision. That also meant he was around Tyia a lot. As he told me, one day when his mother was dispatched. She gave him some Gnomish Fireworks to play with..and according to him. Tyia took them and ran away. He lost her and was only able to find her by the sounds and sights of the fireworks going off…h obviously never forgave her for that…and neither did she when he whapped her on the head with Battle and Calm…a fairly large book for a 6 year old. Thus she cried bloody murder, and when his mother returned he was barred from Felwithe until he apologized to the King and to Tyia…..suffice to say the King got an apology and Fry had never returned to Felwithe castle until that night to rob it.
<br />
----------------------
<br />

<br />
Rev tried to remain composed, but burst with laughter at the serious face of Fry. 
<br />

<br />
'You are still made at her over that? That was years ago!"
<br />

<br />
"Yeah..but they where mine and really good ones too, FuzzleCutter 7000's …they don't make them any more." His eyes filled with tears.
<br />

<br />
Rev just laughed harder and just walked away trying to compose herself. Fry wiped his tears away, sniffed and cried again at the loss of those really great fireworks.
<br />
-----------------------
<br />
I guess I should interrupt again. The reason Fuzzlecutter 7000's aren't made any more, are because of the large amount of firewater and other explosive materiel inside of them. Not that they are unsafe to set of, unlike the rest of gnomish inventions, they only blew up when they are supposed to. They don't make them any more because they simply burned too long and don't stay airborne long enough before they flame out……simply put….unlike what most people today think…it wasn't logging or farming that cleared out the Commons of Antonica.
<br />
---------------------
<br />

<br />
A few moments later, Rev and Fry are running for a hiding place as a contingent of guards make a sweep of the inner sanctum. In a rush they find themselves, in the Royal bath. A large room filled with scents, oils, and platinum. Enough finery that could feed a nation for years all in one room. And in the center of the two story bathing room a large pool that filled almost half the bottom floor. Both of them walked around mouths open and the splendor and majesty. Rev walked up to the second floor to admire the indoor waterfall that fed pool.
<br />

<br />
"WOW!!!!" fry exclaimed after coming out of his state of disbelief. :We don't even need to go any farther. We can loot this place!"
<br />

<br />
"Yeah right. You know how much of a stickler the guild master is. He said only from the Royal quarters. This though rich…is not the Royal quarters…" She called down to him
<br />

<br />
"Still…. do you think they would miss some of this stuff?" he called back holding up a crystal flask filled with scented oils. "Mom would love this. It's smells nice."
<br />

<br />
"Put it down Fry..You Know we have to give what we take back."
<br />

<br />
"Yeah, I know…It's no fair..why does she get to have all this stuff…Mom should get this not that brat…"
<br />

<br />
"It's just how it-" Rev was cut short as the doors began to creep open. Rev instantly stepped back into the shadows concealing her, while Fry hid underneath a table with some of oils and scents.
<br />

<br />
"laalalalala…" A girl hummed as she entered the room sealing the doors. She walked slowly and without a care in the world to the very table where fry was hiding under neath. 
<br />

<br />
"Lalala..lalal…alalala…"
<br />

<br />
Fry covered his ears at Tyia's horrid off-key humming and pray for a swift and merciful death.but he was not so luckily, he endured her humming and watched as she got closer to the table, her white robe covering her, she stepped up to the table and began to clink and clatter with some of the flasks right above Fry.
<br />

<br />
"Perfect", she said to herself..or so she thought. Fry watched as she turned around and the white robe disappeared revealing another two white things in front of him. He stared unabashedly mouth agape.
<br />

<br />
"STOP GAWKING!" Rev shouted the best she could in the silent signing of Scout's Cant.
<br />

<br />
"I can't help it..Hehehehe. This is great!"
<br />

<br />
"You lecherous…Hmm wait. She has a Platinum comb she put on top of her robe. We can take that."
<br />

<br />
"Sounds like a plan. But how are we going to get out of here? She is in the way..not that I mind."
<br />

<br />

<br />
"…we will just have to wait until she is done and then leave…so until then STOP STARING AT THE ROYAL BEHIND!!!"
<br />

<br />
"hehe…Wait I got an idea. When she gets in the bath toss me the Evergreen elixir flask."
<br />

<br />
"You can't be serious! You aren't going to drug the princess!?!"
<br />

<br />
"Why not? It will just go to show even more how pitiful the security is and may even get us a batter position when we get back."
<br />

<br />
"Maybe…Okay, get ready she is getting in.."
<br />

<br />
Fry pulled out his last throwing dagger.
<br />

<br />
"NO DAGGERS!!!!!"
<br />

<br />
"….foo…So much for avenging the fireworks.."
<br />

<br />
"You are hopeless."
<br />

<br />
While this silent conversation was happening, Tyia steps before the large bath and pours lavishing some fairy dust soap powder into pool. Making sparkly, fizzy bubbles. Se giggles and puts the fairy dust container back on the table. But what she doesn't realize and neither do Fry or Rev, is that the container feel over spilling its contents across the table. As the suds get nice and high, she steps in and disappears under the magical suds. At that moment Fry gets out from under the table and motions for Rev to toss the elixir to him. She does so…
<br />

<br />
----------
<br />
At this point in time. I feel I should interrupt yet again. You see Fry, while an expert Scout, is a just a bit….okay….. extremely clumsy. Also I should mention, That while Fairy dust makes for excellent sudsy soap and Evergreen elixir is great for putting people asleep…together they make a very…….very….powerful explosive…Which is what the second stage of Fuzzlecutter 7000's were made of by the way.
<br />
------------
<br />

<br />
Fry opened his ands to catch the sailing flask and did so..but he flask decided to be slippery and hopped out of fry's hands and crashed onto the table, shattering open and spilling it's contents. The elixir snaked its way around the table and mixed with the fairy dust soap powder. Fry stood disbelieving, Tyia who heard the noise stood up out of the midst of the soap suds and to see what was happening and was shock to see, not only a boy in the Royal bath..but FRY!!! Only rev was semi un fazed.
<br />

<br />
"GET DOWN!!!!!" She screamed.
<br />

<br />
Fry leapt the best he could away from the table and collided with Tyia and they both went under the suds and water. At that moment. The entire left wall of the Royal Bath disenagrated with a very loud boom, that echoed throughout not only the castle but also all of Felwithe.
<br />

<br />
As her ears stopped ringing Rev looked up at the destruction caused by the elixir and dust and at the moment as luck would have it a piece of debris clunked her on the head.
<br />

<br />
"OW!" She grumbled and picked up the debris and it wasn't debris at all. It was Tyia's Platinum comb, unscathed to. Unlike the rest of the room, which brought her attention to Fry.
<br />

<br />
"FRY!! You okay!"
<br />

<br />
Fry found himself very wet and on the receiving end of a very sharp slap by a soapy naked Princess.
<br />

<br />
"GET OUT YOUR PEEPING Tom!! HOW DARE YOU SNEAK INTO MY ROYAL BATH!! HOW DARE YOU PUT YOUR HANDS ON ME!!!" At that moment she realized what something disastrous had happened to the left wall.
<br />

<br />
"Wha?"
<br />

<br />
She got of the bath soap and suds dripping everywhere, and stood in shock at the hole.
<br />

<br />
"Fry!! Time to go!!" Rev called sprinting down what was left of the stairs. Fry pulled himself out of the bath and dashed after Rev, at that exact moment the sounds of heavy clanking armor filled the hallway and entered the large hole. As Fry and Rev dashed out in another direction and made their in comparison uneventful escape, the heard the screams of an embarrassed Tyia, as she screeched as the guards saw her naked and dived back into the bath for cover.
<br />
-----------------
<br />

<br />
The Guild master had his head buried into his hands, as paced back in forth in front of Fry and Rev. He had been doing so for the last 3 hours. It was know the day after, and he still didn't know what to make of this. Finally he said something.
<br />

<br />
"WHAT IN THE HELL WHERE YOU TWO DOING!!!! GET IN GET OUT! THAT"S ALL! STEAL ONE LITTLE ITEM. I DID NOT DISPATCH YOU TO REDECORATE FELWITHE CASTLE!!!!!" He boomed.
<br />

<br />
Fry timidly spoke up. "Um sir…aside from the last little part…We accomplished what we where sent to do. No one saw us and we acquired the item we where sent for. Sir"
<br />

<br />
The Guild master paced some more. " Yes that is true……I just..GAH!!! Why where you in the Royal bath in the first place Fry!?!"
<br />

<br />
"I.."
<br />

<br />
"Never mind, save it. I don't want to know. Tell it to the King."
<br />

<br />
Fry went white as a sheet. "The…..The K…KI……King?"
<br />

<br />
"Yes. The King, he wants to talk to you after blowing a hole in his castle."
<br />

<br />
Fry turned even whiter if that was possible. "The…the…the..the..king?"
<br />

<br />
"Sir. I beg you, please don't allow this. It was my fault, I caused the explosion" rev interceded
<br />

<br />
"The…King…King King….." Fry continued to mumble
<br />

<br />
"It doesn't matter who did it. He wants to see you two. Tunare only knows what he has in store. Go..now."
<br />

<br />
"Yes sir" Rev replied, scared for her life, dragging Fry with her, who was still as a statue still mumbling. "The..The ..the the the..King..king…."
<br />

<br />
-----------
<br />

<br />
Several hours later, they where in the Royal Throneroom. Rev solemn and Fry still mumbling like an idiot. But he finally stopped and Rev relaxed slightly. When the royal family entered, th queen smiled looking beautiful and serene as always. And King Tearis though calm and disciplined as he was known to be, almost seemed to be somewhat jovial….only Tyia was glowering. But that was understandable being that she was just embarrassed in front of half the castle just a day ago.
<br />

<br />

<br />
"so you two are the impressive Scouts of Kelethin, Master Rikas has been talking about. He neer told me you two where such skilled decorators as well as Scouts.""
<br />

<br />
Rev chuckled slightly. Fry was still pale.
<br />

<br />
"Oh come now. I am not angry. I had been planning on having the inner sanctum redone any way. And beside if my guards had done a better job, you would not have put a hole there in the first place. So be at ease young ones."
<br />

<br />
Rev did so, Fry sighed relieved that he was not going to be hanged..or something terrible.
<br />

<br />
"But we do have a few small matters ahead of us."
<br />

<br />

<br />
"Yes M'lord?" Fry said, that being the longest coherent sentence he had said in several hours.
<br />

<br />
"First, the item you took. Please return it."
<br />

<br />
"Of course" Fry opening his belt pouch, and withdrew Tyia's comb and slowly with it as far in front of him he could put it, with out being openly insulting, walked up to Tyia and let her take it…snatch it really. She glowered at fiercely and fry quickly returned to his place by Rev and awaiting for the Kings next matter at hand.
<br />

<br />
"Second, though I am not angry about the redecoration. I can not allow you walk away with reprimand. So before either of you can obtain your guild cloaks and the rank of Scout. You must perform a service for me. I will discuss that matter further with you when the time comes."
<br />

<br />
"Lastly." He stared directly at Fry. "Fry. You know that the banning I placed on you is still in effect and it is only by a temporary abstention that you are here right now or yesterday. But if you are going to obtain your cloak and rank, you are going to have to repay, and in order to do so, you must stay here with my soldiers. So, if you wish to continue on your Mother's path. I ask that you apologize for your actions those years ago and your recent ..episode with my daughter."
<br />

<br />
Fry gritted his teeth..he really hated giving her a victory..
<br />

<br />
"I will not order you to do so, an apology must come from the heart, but you can not stay here if you do not. So please make your choice Fry."
<br />

<br />
Fry sighed and walked up to Tyia, and kneeled.
<br />

<br />
"M'lady Tyia it is with all my heart, that I ask your forgiveness for hitting you on the head with a book…and then…entering your bath."
<br />

<br />
Tyia frowned some more and then spoke "I forgive you"
<br />

<br />
"Good! Welcome to my rank young Fry and young Reverdone. Go tell your families of what has happened and report to the barracks for cot assignment and await my call."
<br />

<br />
"yes M'lord"
<br />
"Yes M'Lord" They said and they saluted him and made to head back to Kelethin. But at the last moment fry stopped and turned back up to the Throne.
<br />

<br />
"What is wrong young fry?"
<br />

<br />
"I wish to further make amends to the Princess for my transgressions M'lord."
<br />

<br />
"There is no need."
<br />

<br />
"Yes, but in my heart I feel I can not let this go as is. May I sir?"
<br />

<br />
"You may."
<br />

<br />
Fry stood up proudly smiling and walked up to Tyia and bent over to whisper in her ear.
<br />

<br />
"You may want to have a cleric take a look at that mole on your behind."
<br />

<br />
Tyia turned red "WHY YOU!!!" Fry dashed away with Tyia in hot pursuit. "COME BACK HERE !!!"
<br />

<br />
The King just roared with laughter.

Chapter 2  Pop , a blushing elf and the Demi-God

---------------------
<br />

<br />

<br />
It had already been several weeks since, Fry and Rev had been assign quarters in Felwithe and for those long weeks they waited for their assignment. So that they cold finally become full fledged Scouts of Faydwer. But unfortunately the King had no use for them in all that time..Which really sucked for Fry because though technically he had no rank in King Tearis army, he was still under royal control….more specifically and painfully Tyia's.
<br />

<br />
Fry collased in heap onto the hard bed and tried to sleep, he had been Tyia's gopher for the last weeks…he didn't mind this sort of work, he had done it all the time for mom and the guildmaster. It was the fact that Tyia was the one that was ordering him around that made it nearly impossible to bear.
<br />

<br />
"Fry go for this..Fry go for that..Get my slippers, get my breakfast..clean my room. Fry Fry…. Fry ….Fry….. Fry. He was so sick of hearing his name now.. Fry Fry Fry Fry Fry Fry-"
<br />

<br />
"FRY!!"
<br />

<br />
"Huh! What!"
<br />

<br />
"Sheesh Fry I've been calling you for the last coupla minutes. Get into your uniform, we have some work to do."
<br />

<br />
Fry rolled his eyes and then pulled the covers over his head.
<br />

<br />
"Go away Rev….Tell Tyia I'm sleeping."
<br />

<br />
"Okay, I'll tell her, but what am I going to tell the King?"
<br />

<br />
"Why tell him anything?"
<br />

<br />
"Because he sent for us silly!"
<br />

<br />
Fry leapt out of bed, instantly looking refreshed. "LET'S GO!!!!" And made to charge off to the Throne room.
<br />

<br />
"Wait a sec."
<br />

<br />
"Wha? "
<br />

<br />
"Go take a bath first. You stink" She said holding her nose and sticking her tongue at him.
<br />

<br />
"Sigh…" Looking somewhat dejected he about faced and headed to the Soldiers bathing room…not nearly as large or as even a tenth as nice as the one they robbed weeks ago. 15 minutes later, Fry exited the barracks looking refreshed and in a new uniform and found Rev just outside leaning against the wall juggling her Scout's knife on one finger.
<br />

<br />
"Much better! I can no longer smell you a mile way…only half a mile."
<br />

<br />
"Haha….I don't see how you can be so cheerful after all that labor Tyia put us through."
<br />

<br />
"What labor?"
<br />

<br />
"What do you mean What labor? The cleaning and the sweeping, and the patato chopping…I hate potatoes….."
<br />

<br />

<br />
"I dunno what you mean, I have been relaxing these last few weeks. Its so nice after all that training."
<br />

<br />
Fry looked at her in disbelief.
<br />

<br />
"You mean, I've been working for Tyia all this time and you don't even get one lousy job?"
<br />

<br />
"Well, there was that time she had me come with her on that trip to Steamfront."
<br />

<br />
"!!! It's just not fair…"
<br />

<br />
"Well, I told you to stop staring."
<br />

<br />
"I couldn't help ti, it was so big"
<br />

<br />
Rev smiled, then desperately tried to stop herself from laughing. "Haha…Just don't tell her that…You'll never get off kitchen duty. HAHHAA"
<br />
--------------
<br />

<br />
In a few short minutes, the two where once again in the presnce of King Tearis. Only this time it was just them. The queen, the members of the court, the princess, and the Kings jovial expression, all gone…this could only mean one thing.
<br />

<br />
"I have some matters of upmost importance for the both of you. I normally would not give such dire matters to ones so un experienced, but your reports and actions have been more then excellent."
<br />

<br />
This both uplifted and in away devastated their spirits. Lifted because of the high praise, but destroyed it because they knew that what ever the mission was…it had low survivability.
<br />

<br />
"Frydious, please stay here for a moment while I brief Reverdone of her assignment."
<br />

<br />
This troubled him…something was dreadfully wrong…the King never used his full name.
<br />

<br />
Rev stood up and followed the king as they disappeared behind the Throne room,as he waited for the King to return. His mind raced to think what could possibly be so wrong………dragons? Some one preparing for war?…..Tyia's bottom getting even bigger? He snickered at this last thought. At that moment, the King and rev returned back the Throne room. Rev had dawned a face of seriousness, she was know only thinking of her mission….something was definitely wrong..she was never so serious.
<br />

<br />
"Frydious come with me"
<br />

<br />
He complied and followed the King behind the Throne room. It was his first tie back there, the War room. The King paced a bit around the long table in the center of the room and then stopped to gaze at the large mural, a map of all of Norrath.
<br />

<br />
"Frydious. What I am about to tell you  is not to go beyond this room. You will speak to no one of your task,except to myself and to my advisors and no one else. If some tells you that they are carrying orders by me to divulge this, do not believe them. Is that understood Frydious?"
<br />

<br />
"Yes sir."
<br />

<br />
"Good." The King moved to a section of the map that represented Faydwer and upon finer movement placed his hand above the area nearby Kelethin. "Over the last few weeks, I have been getting reports from other Scouts and informants of increased activity from the Crushbone Orcs. It appears that they are preparing an assault upon our lands."
<br />

<br />
Fry looked surprised…this was not new why was he so secretive and tight about tha. The Orcs could never beat us. Though he did not mean to show his dismay, he did and the King realized it too.
<br />

<br />
" I know what you are thinking Frydious. The Orcs are always preparing for an assault upon Kelethin, but this is different. This time they are not alone…and are far stronger then ever before…Unless we find out who is aiding them, why and how…I fear..that it may be inevitable that they will trample Kelethin….and possibly even Felwithe."
<br />

<br />
"NO way! Those orcs are nohing compared to us. Don't be stupi-oops…sorry sir…"
<br />

<br />
The King smiled for the first time, but it faded. "it is alright, I admire those that speak there minds, and I share your optimizism. That is why we are striking first and why I am dispatching you to find out more about who ever is aiding the Orcs. This is your duty to me before you will obtain your rank Frydious. Well that is all. Go."
<br />

<br />
"By your leave, sir."
<br />

<br />

<br />
Fry bowed and dashed out of the room heading for the stables.
<br />

<br />
"And good luck to you, young Fry."
<br />

<br />
-----------------------------
<br />

<br />
Of course on his first real mission, it would be cold and raining. The cloak he wore was not much protection against the elements. But still the excitement of his first real mission warmed him, the danger, the thrill of stalking that truly did not know he was coming it was so great!!! He was so happy he nearly jumped up and down for joy, but luckily he remembered the part about  the danger and got back into his crouch.
<br />

<br />
So far nothing unusual was happening in the Crushbone territory. The buldings where still decaying, the rain was raining..the orcs where orcish…nothing truly of note…so he decided to move from the entrance cave.
<br />

<br />
The orcs where slow and dimwitted as usual, he easily made it past them and promptly got lost. Serves him right for trying to follow orcish street signs. As he meandered around he found various things he should return too, seeing about how to free the slaves, finding out what that awful smell was coming from the orcish mess hall. But those where side issues, he needed to get to Crushbone Citadel.
<br />

<br />
Luckily, evergreen elixir is also a good tongue loosener as well as a great party favor, and tool for knocking out castle guards. So after mugging a Orc legionnaire and interrogating it, for a long time…it seemed to have pent up feelings and just wanted some one to talk to.. He finally knew where to find Crushbone Citadel, and was perched in a tree with a clear view into Emperor Crush's private quarters. As he waited for several hours in the unceasing rain, he began to wonder if anything was going to happen, and if he was going to have to report a negative mission to the King. He nearly cried about this, but then luck turned out to be on his side.
<br />

<br />
Inside the room a door opened and in lumbered the large leader of the orcs, Emperor Crush, followed by a male dark elf and then the prettiest girl he had evr seen…She was so beautiful….long silver hair danced freely,  she was so perfect, especially the way the leather she was wearing was so tight and form fitting over her BLUE skin! This snapped him out of his reverie. She was a Teir'dal, why was he longing a dark elf….that was so pretty….sigh….
<br />

<br />
He began to daydream a bit, but then snapped out of this again as Crush began to speak to the male.
<br />

<br />
"So when cAn We Expecting da new weapons deeeeVinN?"
<br />

<br />
The Male seemed obviously agitated by Crush's horrible speech, but he subdued it or at least tried too. Crush was the king of Orcs no one could expect him to be able to recite great works.
<br />

<br />
"When ever you make your first tribute to Kaiyan'wang M'lord Crush"
<br />

<br />
"U take all dAt 'wangy need. Me legIOns need wEApoNs to CRUSH da smELly elfs"
<br />

<br />
"You are most gracious Sire. Kaiyan'wang will only desire a payment of 200 platinum each month."
<br />

<br />
"Dat aLl?"
<br />

<br />
"Kaiyan'wang only needs a small token of your loyalty."
<br />

<br />
"Dis Es gUUD!"
<br />

<br />
The dark elf was obviously grating his teeth and desperately trying to come up with ways to stop this conversation before he ended up giving Crush a severe beating and a lesson in grammar and pronunciation.
<br />

<br />
"I am glad that you are pleased Emperor Crush, if you will excuse me. I will go take the platinum now and send it on the way to Kaiyan'wang's temple. Your new weapons ands the priest who will teach your oracles higher spell casting *cough* hopefully some grammar for your uneducated backwater kind *cough* . Pardon me, sir I have a bit of a cold. As I was saying, they will be arriving with in the next 3 weeks."
<br />

<br />
"Dis Es gud!!! Me Lik cHU dark Elfies!"
<br />

<br />
The elf smiled weakly, his resolve fading with each of Crush's breaths. "Excuse me." And he quickly exited, leaving his assistant the female dark elf. To finish up the business.
<br />

<br />
When Dvinn closed the door, she slowly began to open her shirt, peaking both Crush's and Fry's attention. She opened it it some more and withdrew a small shiney amulet…destroying both their thoughts or at least Fry's thoughts.
<br />
------------------------
<br />

<br />
I guess this is my interruption for the chapter. I guess I should explain this part right quick, you see though it is not widely known, Orcs and Gnomes are actually related. They both have a love of shiny things, that click and whir. Gnomes because they are masters of tinkering with machines and the like….Orcs…because they are really…really…really stupid and are easily fascinated by things like that. So when the girl pulled out the amulet, you can see why Fry was the only one disappointed.
<br />
--------------------------
<br />

<br />

<br />
"OooH! Shiny Ting!!!"
<br />

<br />
"Yes , it is shiny. And it is for you Emperor." The large orc danced and giggled like a little child.
<br />

<br />
"FOor ME!?! YA!!!"
<br />

<br />

<br />
The dark elf girl began to feel her patience beginning to wear.
<br />

<br />
"When ever you wish to summon one of us or pray to Kaiyan'wang simply- " She began to slow down her speech, like she would a slow child.
<br />

<br />
"Rub….the…emerald…and…… hold..it ….to …..the…ground… Okay?"
<br />

<br />
"Otay! Rub da grownd and hold da the EmErald!" Crush repeated happily.
<br />

<br />
The girl sighed , her head in her hands and just agreed, she could feel her mind being dulled by this orc.
<br />

<br />
"I'm going to go now. Until another day Emperor Crush." She bowed and quickly departed off out of Fry's view. Emperor Crush admired the amulet for a bit and then placed it on his windowsill and went out of Fry's view and soon Fry heard the door close.
<br />

<br />
Hmm..this is my chance. Teir'dal are giving the orcs weapons and training. They are probably rejects from even those of Neriak to make up some God or something. O well. My mission is done, I should take that amulet, it may hold some more clues.
<br />

<br />
He edged down the branch; just to the end that was sitting right against the windowsill. He was too short to actually see anything once he came down from his hiding spot, but he just felt around in the general area where the amulet was. He kept searching getting frustrated and then his fingers brushed up against something. It wasn't metal..metal is hard this was smooth and soft…he leaned a little bit closer and tried to get a better fell, it was about hand sized…soft yet firm….now there where two of them…
<br />

<br />
"GET YOUR HANDS OF ME!!!!" Screamed a female voice startling him causing him to withdraw his hand and leap back accidentally knocking the amulet off the sill without meaning too, but that wasn't his primary concern. It was the female dark elf looking purple her faced flushed with a mixture of anger and embarrassment. She fumed at him and then leapt out onto the branch.
<br />

<br />
"No wait don't get out here!" Fry  cried
<br />

<br />
"Save it for the thrashing I am going to give - AAH!!!"
<br />

<br />
"AAH!!!" The both screamed as the branch gave away with the extra weight and the y plummeted to the ground, she crashed into thee mud hard losing her breath and then lost it again when Fry landed on top of her. And so they both stayed, the air knocked out of both of them for those few short moments. Fry slowly came out of his daze, to find himself staring into the elf's eyes. At first the seemed, weak and without fury as before, but that changed quickly when she realized he was on top of her.
<br />

<br />

<br />
"GET OFF ME!!!!" She shouted and without waiting for him to move, threw him off.
<br />

<br />
A sharp pain jabbed him in his back, and as he investigated he fond that she had accidentally thrown him on top of the amulet. Trying to move fast as possible, he pocketed the amulet and tried to regain his bearings, but to know luck the girl was also on her feet. She was needless to say, mad. So mad, fry could have sworn that the rain that fell on her was actually boiling.
<br />

<br />
"I have endured ridicule, the touch of sweaty trolls, the rank breath of ogres and orcs, but never in my life, have ever been so humiliated in my life!!!! I am going to make you suffer!!!!!" With that she withdrew two daggers, with such precision and deftness, that it signified one thing, she was a skilled scout like Fry. Though he did not realize it just at that moment, his heart opened even more for this girl. A beautiful girl who was also a skilled scout…she was perfect…aside from the fact at that moment she wanted to kill him. At this moment, though he knew she was a deadly enemy, she was also a girl…and some one he had wronged..at that moment his sense of honor rose.
<br />

<br />
"I'm sorry."
<br />

<br />
That startled her, her she was just inches away from attacking and killing him and he was apologizing for grabbing her…and not only that he was sincere…It was so new to her, it stunned her, no one had ever really treated her with respect. So she didn't know what to do, and neither did Fry. Fry never wished to kill any one, or hurt a female…..aside from Tyia maybe…and he did not want to fight this girl even if she was a Dark Elf. And she was unsure if she should attack him, some one so innocent to apologize to their greatest enemy. 
<br />

<br />
So they just stood there for those few moments, unmoving until..
<br />

<br />
"WhAT R going there!?" cried Emporer Crush
<br />
"What's happening out there Sevet?" called Dvinn doing his best to ignore Crush
<br />

<br />
Though she was still unsure what to make of Fry, reflexes took advantage.
<br />

<br />
"INTRUDER!!!"
<br />

<br />
Fry instantly dashed away and ran as fast as he could towards the exit cave, leaping from shadow to shadow as hundreds of orcs descended upon Sevet's position. She knew that he would escape, she was the only one that could have stopped him and she let him go. Why?
<br />

<br />
---------------------
<br />

<br />

<br />
Felwithe was abuzz with celebration; the gilding of Scouts was a new affair. It was usually done quietly in Kelethin, but King Tearis wanted special attention to the newest members of the Ranks of Scouts.
<br />

<br />
In the main hall of Felwithe, bards blared triumphant music that nearly deafened the gathered crowd, but soon the bards where out done by the cheering crowd…more specifically Fry and Rev's Mothers as the 2 new scouts entered the hall. They stood at the entrance and awaited to be announced, which was a first for both of them.
<br />

<br />
The page shouted
<br />

<br />
"Introducing to M'Lord. Scout of Faydwer Rank of Chroito First Class. Reverdone Moocienaga Dal Kampo Ciba !"
<br />

<br />
She stepped forward and approached the Throne, her green cloak with gold trim, with the Scout insignia displayed proudly on the shoulders beautifully matched her long flowing hair and complexion.
<br />

<br />
"Introducing to M'Lord Scout of Faydwer Rank of Chroito First Class. Frydious Angus-Bilbao Menlore!"
<br />

<br />
"YEAH FRY!!! THAT"S MY BOY!!!!!!! DON'T SHUSH ME!! "
<br />

<br />
Fry flushed slightly but continued up to the Throne and knelt beside Rev and awaited the King to approach them from the Throne. The queen was beaming proudly at the newest additions and even Tyia was smiling…..mainly because of all the things she was thinking of torturing Fry with know that he was enlisted in the ranks.
<br />

<br />
The King stood over them smiling a smile 10 miles wide. He placed his hands on their shoulders. 
<br />

<br />
"Rise Scouts, for this is the last time you will ever kneel before me."
<br />

<br />
They did so, to the cheers of the crowd, again the mothers drowned out the rest of the crowd.
<br />
"Fry, Rev, though you are young you have proven that you are skilled beyond your years, and it is with great pleasure that I welcome you to our ranks. From now until, you return to the great mother, you are Scouts of -"
<br />

<br />
The sound of someone clapping interrupted the king. The King looked up to the source of the interruption high up at the top of the room
<br />

<br />
"Augustas!"
<br />

<br />
Fry instantly turned around to look where the King was. "POP!" It couldn't be, after all this time. It was Fry's father hovering the air.
<br />

<br />
"So, you decided finally became a Scout. I am proud, but unfortunately, you have chosen the wrong side of Kaiyan'wang's temper!" He floated down to the floor and stared past Fry and at King Tearis.
<br />

<br />
"Pop?"
<br />

<br />
"Augustas, so you return after all this time! Where have you been, where did you go when Faydwer needed you the most!"
<br />

<br />
"Having a revelation about Norrath, but I am not here to talk about that Tearis. I am here to deliver a message."
<br />

<br />
"And what is that, you deserter!"
<br />

<br />
Augustas raised his hand and fire and lightning encircled it. "Do not cross Kaiyan'wang again!" Without another word a bolt leapt out of his hands and toward the throne, not to the King, or Fry or Rev, or even the Queen…but Tyia. Tyia was too scared to move as the bolt grew closer and closer and then there was a flash and explosion and a cry of her name. When she opened her eyes, Fry was in front of her, he had taken the spell meant for her. He staggered slightly, his prized new cloak was incinerated and he had many burns, and his strength gave way and Fry collapsed.
<br />

<br />
"Father…….why?"
<br />

<br />
He blacked out..
<br />

<br />
-------------------
<br />
Well I guess I should interrupt one last time, not for a bit of information, but because my feather pen is running out of ink. So I will just have to continue this once I go buy some more. I just hope the merchant doesn't over charge me again. well that is side tracking. Until later dear precious readers….even if you are human.

<br />
                     Ch.3 Cone-head and the War of Heroes
<br />
                     --------------------------
<br />

<br />

<br />
                     Fry's luck always had a way of turning bad, here he was stuck in the middle of Everfrost
<br />
                     in the freezing cold and snow. Trudging up and down this stupid mountain for that
<br />
                     cone-headed Al'kabor…..how did he get into messes like this? He comes for one little
<br />
                     itty-bitty clue about Pop and Kaiyan'wang and now he is stuck playing housemaid for
<br />
                     that stupid cone-head!
<br />

<br />
                     "Quit Lolly gagging!! Come here and start cleaning and put those beakers away boy!!!" A
<br />
                     loud gruff voice called from inside the nice warm cave.
<br />

<br />
                     …..I'll show you where you can stick those beakers….sigh….how did this happen?..
<br />

<br />
                     -------------------------
<br />
                     Several days have passed since the attack at the Scouts Gilding. Fry's father Augustas
<br />
                     disappeared during the panic and hysteria after the magical bolt intended for Princess
<br />
                     Tyia struck down Fry. Luckily though he suffered multiple injuries, mostly burns and a
<br />
                     broken arm, Fry survived the intense attack, but needless to say the effects of being
<br />
                     blasted by your own father went on further then a few scratches. No one was
<br />
                     unchanged by the radical events that happened, old memories were reawakened, minds
<br />
                     were set to wonder about this mysterious Kaiyan'wang, and old impressions were
<br />
                     shattered forever.
<br />

<br />
                     Fry lay in deep sleep in the soft bed inside Felwithe, the clerics had been paying extra
<br />
                     attention to this young scout, mainly out of pride for this young achiever, and also from
<br />
                     orders. Though the King's orders would supersede, being that that the orders where on
<br />
                     paper the same, it wouldn't really matter. But it was the heartfelt plea of Tyia of all
<br />
                     people, the encouraged the clerics to put in the extra time and mana into healing this
<br />
                     young boy.
<br />

<br />
                     Though she did not want to upset his wounds, she held onto him as he slept and wept
<br />
                     silently for him. He could have died, that spell meant for her, could have killed him. She
<br />
                     had been so mean to him ever since she first met him and still he jumped in front of the
<br />
                     spell meant for her. Why? Why did he care so much for her after all that?
<br />

<br />
                     "Oh..Fry…please wake up…." She sniffed again and held him a little tighter.
<br />

<br />
                     "….ow…" He moaned meekly
<br />

<br />
                     "FRY!!!"
<br />

<br />
                     "…..I'm up mom…I'm coming…for breakfast…."
<br />

<br />
                     She giggled happily as tears of joy began to flow, he was finally awake., groggy and a
<br />
                     little delirious but awake
<br />

<br />
                     "Fry!" 
<br />

<br />
                     This time his eyes open up slightly and turned to the sound of her voice. "…..Tyia?"
<br />

<br />
                     "Fry…you stupid lunkhead! Who told you to go jumping at fire balls?" she said smiling no
<br />
                     venom in her voice.
<br />

<br />
                     He smiled "If that's the case…. you can have …the next one..ouch….where am I?"
<br />

<br />
                     "The cleric hall in Felwithe."
<br />

<br />
                     "Where…is Rev…and Pop?"
<br />

<br />
                     "We don't know where your Father went, in the confusion after …you went down, he
<br />
                     vanished. Rev went charging after him, heh.. she just became a Chroito and already she
<br />
                     is ordering around the enlisted men. She ordered some supplies and a half dozen men
<br />
                     and left in hot pursuit, she hasn't reported back yet, but it has only been 3 days."
<br />
                     -------------------------------------
<br />
                     Guess who? Yep, it is me again. I am here to give you a bit of information once
<br />
                     again…you know with all these interruptions, I et you are just dying to figure who I am.
<br />
                     Hehe…well you will just have to wait many more chapters before you figure out who
<br />
                     Fry's wife is. Hehehe. But any way, back to the info.
<br />

<br />
                     You see, though Chroito's are technically officers in the Felwithe army, they don't really
<br />
                     have any power of command. A Chroito first class, is…hmm..whats the Qeynos
<br />
                     comparison…o yeah! A Third Lieutenant, it's essentially as low as you can go in ranks
<br />
                     and still be an officer, but like I already said, a third lieutenant can not command unless
<br />
                     her seniors fall in battle, but that is a rare scenario, the rank just ensures that they are
<br />
                     in the line of command.
<br />

<br />
                     Well, to make a long drab boring twisted, really mixed up military thing short, Rev legally,
<br />
                     could not and should not have taken out those warriors…which just goes to show how
<br />
                     dumb and gullible warriors are.
<br />
                     -------------------------
<br />

<br />
                     Fry began to sit up and prepare to go after Rev, but a flash of pain and Tyia's protests
<br />
                     kept him down.
<br />

<br />
                     "Fry, it is too soon, you are still recovering; you took a bad blow."
<br />

<br />
                     "I have to go after Rev and find Pop…I need to know why he is doing this!"
<br />

<br />
                     "I know, but you are still too weak right now, please Fry. Stay in bed get some more
<br />
                     rest…I don't know what I would do……if you got hurt again.."
<br />

<br />
                     Fry stared wide-eyed at Tyia, then smiled. "You like me, You got a crush on me" he
<br />
                     teased in a sing-song voice
<br />

<br />
                     Tyia flushed beet red "I do not!, I just..umm…..Father will need you later on that's all."
<br />
                     And before she could get anymore embarrassed or red in the face she zipped out of the
<br />
                     room.
<br />

<br />
                     Fry smiled some more, but the smile faded as his mind wandered back to the events at
<br />
                     hand. Bracing himself he got out of bed, and looked for some clothes, he had made up
<br />
                     his mind, he was going after Pop, but fate or at least clerics who knows, determined
<br />
                     that an uppity brave man…….boy of action like himself might do something like that, and
<br />
                     thus could not find any clothing. He grumbled a bit, and then thought about his
<br />
                     predicament…if he was a cleric, where would he hide the clothing? The Cleric
<br />
                     Guildmaster's room…or the washroom, if they still weren't clean.
<br />

<br />
                     So without another thought, he dashed off …..and promptly created quite a ruckus as
<br />
                     one would expect a naked elf running through the halls of a prestigious castle….oh well.
<br />
                     All in all it was an ego wise, a painless run, aside from a few gasps and a couple of wolf
<br />
                     whistles which made him flush.
<br />

<br />
                     A few minutes later, Fry was back in his uniform, his left arm in a impromptu sling and he
<br />
                     was now donning a new Scout's cloak, that had been set aside for him, when he was
<br />
                     supposed to get out of bed. At that moment, one of castle clerics, found him and
<br />
                     presided to chastise him for getting up so soon, but because of orders from King Tearis,
<br />
                     she couldn't force him back to bed for rest, quite the contrary, he was to report to the
<br />
                     King immediately.
<br />
                     -------------------------
<br />

<br />
                     Fry found the King in the War room, sitting at the large table, studying the amulet Fry
<br />
                     had recovered on his mission….or so he thought. When he moved closer to the King he
<br />
                     noticed that the Amulet the King was holding was of a different design, not vastly
<br />
                     different, but just enough and still bore that strange symbol, believed to be the mark of
<br />
                     Kaiyan'wang.
<br />

<br />
                     "You sent for me M'Lord?"
<br />

<br />
                     "Ahh, Fry good to see you up so soon." The King said in a cheery voice, but he soon
<br />
                     went back to looking at the amulet with a face of grimness.
<br />

<br />
                     "Sir? "
<br />

<br />
                     "…."
<br />

<br />
                     Fry stood still being patient.
<br />

<br />
                     "Please sit Fry, and tell me what do you know about the War of Heros?"
<br />

<br />
                     "It was a war that took place about 8 years ago, between light and Darkness. The might
<br />
                     of the United Kingdoms of Faydwer and the Coalition of Neriak, that culminated in the
<br />
                     final showdown that has perverted the laws of nature, Bloody Kithicor."
<br />

<br />
                     "Yes, a good telling of what was taught in school and what I allowed to be told to the
<br />
                     public."
<br />

<br />
                     "Sir?"
<br />

<br />
                     "Did your mother ever tell you about her role in the War of Heros, or more specifically
<br />
                     the events of Bloody Kithicor and the subsequent battles?"
<br />

<br />
                     "No , aside from that she served with the Unity during it, but then who didn't in some
<br />
                     form?"
<br />

<br />
                     "Yes, that's true, but what you don't know is that, she helped reduce the damage
<br />
                     caused by Lans T'val and curbed the perverting influence, so did your father. They
<br />
                     where both instrumental in Bloody Kithicor and the Battle of Lavastorm."
<br />

<br />
                     Fry was stunned, his mother? His father? Both standing side by side with the King during
<br />
                     Bloody Kithicor..he knew that his mother was one of the best Scouts of Faydwer, but he
<br />
                     had no idea that she was that good!….but wait, what was that about a Battle of
<br />
                     Lavastorm? He had never heard of such battle….
<br />

<br />
                     "Battle of Lavastorm?"
<br />

<br />
                     "Yes, that was the true ending to the War of Heros, though it was not a very good one
<br />
                     and was why I never allowed it to be public knowledge, but before I tell you more about
<br />
                     that. What do you know about your father Fry?"
<br />

<br />
                     "Almost nothing Sir."
<br />

<br />
                     "Do you know what guild he served?"
<br />

<br />
                     "No.."
<br />

<br />
                     "Hmm. I guess she did not want you know, not that I blame her, nearly all of the druids
<br />
                     of Kelethin hated your father, and the marriage between your mother and him."
<br />

<br />
                     "Why?"
<br />

<br />
                     "Your father was a Geomancer, the other counter part to druids."
<br />

<br />
                     "?"
<br />

<br />
                     "You see all things come in pairs, light and dark, fire and water. And the same goes for
<br />
                     the various guilds. Scouts and Monks, Paladins and Shadow Knights, Clerics and
<br />
                     Necromancers, Druids and Geomancers."
<br />

<br />
                     Fry kept his thoughts about the other guilds that have no opposite like enchanters and
<br />
                     mages to himself..why mess with such a great explanation?
<br />

<br />
                     "Druids get their power from serving nature and in turn are granted their abilities by
<br />
                     nature, Geomancers on the other hand see nature as nothing more then a tool and bend
<br />
                     nature herself to their will. Needless to say, this upsets Druids, but they keep this
<br />
                     discontent to themselves because though they hate to admit it, Geomancers are far
<br />
                     more powerful and deadly then a thousand druids. And rightly so, in all of history since
<br />
                     their inception there has only been 35 Geomancers and your father Augustas, was the
<br />
                     last and the most powerful of them all."
<br />

<br />
                     Fry was shocked; all of this was news to him…so much that he never knew about his
<br />
                     own family….
<br />

<br />
                     "What was Father like before he disappeared?"
<br />

<br />
                     "He was kind, innocent man, he had great since of humor, and an extremely
<br />
                     overdeveloped love for the dramatic, honestly I'm surprised he didn't show it off when
<br />
                     he attacked."
<br />

<br />
                     "What do you mean?"
<br />

<br />
                     "For some reason, he just loved posing and calling out his spell incantations. I guess he
<br />
                     thought it made Geomancery seem really cool or something. To try to when over
<br />
                     disciples, I suppose..I don't really know for sure..he just loved doing it." He smiled as a
<br />
                     though passed though his head 
<br />

<br />
                     "That spell he used, that you intercepted, was a toned down version of his favorite
<br />
                     spell, back when he rode with me." The king cleared his throat and stepped away from
<br />
                     the table.
<br />

<br />
                     "FINAL!!!" He raised his hands above his head.
<br />

<br />
                     "FLASH!!!" He twirled around like a top
<br />

<br />

<br />
                     "AAAATTACCK!!!!" He stopped his twirling his arms outstretched towards Fry, his hands
<br />
                     pressed against each other in fists.
<br />

<br />
                     Fry couldn't help but laugh at this, not that he meant to…but honestly how could you
<br />
                     not laugh at 270 year old High Elf King twirling around like a top?
<br />

<br />
                     "Yes, I guess it is pretty funny when I do it, but still, your father loved posing and it
<br />
                     never served him wrong. Your mother loved it even more when he did it, she got a big
<br />
                     kick out of it, the only ones who hated it, where of course the Druids of Kelethin. Which
<br />
                     ended up in a very short duel over your mother."
<br />

<br />
                     "Why?"
<br />

<br />
                     "I don't think I should be telling your mothers love affairs….o well! I love a good gossip"
<br />
                     He smiled "You see back when Augustas proposed to your mother, the Druidic
<br />
                     Guildmaster was also in love with her, and wanted to marry her as well. So he
<br />
                     challenged Augustas to a duel and the prize being your mother."
<br />

<br />
                     "She actually allowed this?"
<br />

<br />
                     "Well, she was a bit of an attention hog back in the old days. I remember the duel well,
<br />
                     Augustas and Skayer in the Kelethin training grounds, your mother upon the hill staring
<br />
                     wide eyed at the display being put on over her. Skayer summoned his animal companions
<br />
                     and they surged toward your father. He stood adamant until the wolves and rabbits and
<br />
                     bats where within an inch of his face."
<br />

<br />
                     The King quickly whipped his hand in front of him "DISPERSAL! He cried! And the animal
<br />
                     where scattered across the Greater Faydark and then it was over for Skayer." 
<br />

<br />
                     The King stood up again twirling like a ditzy top once again "QUAKE WITH FEAR!!!! The
<br />
                     ground shook and cracked and Skayer was knocked down unconscious and the great
<br />
                     Druid rings that had resided by Kelethin in perfect harmony for centuries broke and
<br />
                     crumbled and the great duel between Druidic and Geomancery was over and your mother
<br />
                     ran over and hugged Augustas giggling happily like a little school girl"
<br />

<br />
                     The King looked sad after finishing this part of the tale. "She used to laugh a lot back
<br />
                     then….I haven't heard her laugh since the War of Heros.." 
<br />

<br />
                     "What happened? Why did Pop leave?"
<br />

<br />
                     "I don't know why he left, but I suspect it has to do with this Amulet and whoever this
<br />
                     Kaiyan'wang is…but you see this symbol on the amulet you brought me?" He held up the
<br />
                     new one. "It is exactly the same as the one, that I recovered after the Battle of
<br />
                     Lavastorm…" The King stared at the amulets and his mind drifted back to that fateful
<br />
                     day…
<br />

<br />
                     ---------------------
<br />
                     "CHARGE!" The King cried upon his white warhorse, the last of his army surged against
<br />
                     the last of Lans T'val's coalition, the two ragged armies battled amongst the lava flows.
<br />
                     This was the true end to the War of Heros, the battle between the famed heroes of
<br />
                     Faydwer and Neriak. Tearis; Son of Nature and Lans T'val; daughter of Hate. Augustas,
<br />
                     the Geomancer and his nemesis Suradar, the Necromancer, Myria ,the Scout and
<br />
                     Turnica, the Rogue. Each one legends in their own countries..hence the name …The War
<br />
                     of Heroes
<br />

<br />
                     Unlike what had been told to the public Lans had not disappeared at Bloody Kithicor, she
<br />
                     was not spirited away by Innorouk. It was a powerful blinding spell utilized by her
<br />
                     clerics…and the perversion that still haunts Kithicor forest was a direct result of the
<br />
                     clashing of too powerful forms of magic. Necromancy and Geomancy, so in away though
<br />
                     the King will never say it nor will he allow any one to blame him, it was partly Augustas's
<br />
                     fault for the undead walking that haunt Kithicor at knight…but the battle could not have
<br />
                     been won without Augustas's awesome power.
<br />

<br />
                     Many fell against blades, some fell into the lava flows others ran away in fear for their
<br />
                     lives…but amidst the chaos, two lovers stood their ground proudly. One wielding
<br />
                     awesome magics, the other swift and deadly daggers.
<br />

<br />
                     "Glacial ices, I give you haste! ICE BITE STRIKE!!!!" Thousands of ie shards left from
<br />
                     Augustas's hands and pierced the onslaught of soldiers. 
<br />

<br />
                     "You never get tired of that do you honey?"
<br />

<br />
                     'HAHA! NEVER! One must always take pride and have fun with their work!" He raised his
<br />
                     hands above his head "FINAL!"
<br />

<br />
                     Augustas began to spin, far more gracefully then the King, mana gliding around him.
<br />
                     "FLASH!!"
<br />

<br />
                     He stopped his spin, arms outstretched, fists pointing directly at a large column of
<br />
                     soldiers " AAAAAATTTTTTACK!!!!!" A bolt of Fire and lightning leapt out from his hands
<br />
                     and just before it reached the first soldier, the bolt exploded and the wave of fire and
<br />
                     electricity scorched the oncoming soldiers.
<br />

<br />
                     "HAH!! YEAH!! I am number one!!"
<br />

<br />
                     "No you are not" 
<br />
                     She spun him around and kissed him passionately…. in the midst of a life threatening,
<br />
                     battle of certain doom for all of Norrath….and they say dark elfs are weird….. 
<br />

<br />
                     "I am." She finished, when she broke off the kiss.
<br />

<br />
                     "You are so right, pardon me."
<br />

<br />
                     "You are forgiven this time..but you have to make it up to me later……"
<br />

<br />
                     "GLADY!" He said with a happy devilish smile
<br />

<br />
                     "By washing the dishes."
<br />

<br />
                     "Ahh……" 
<br />

<br />
                     "Hehe" 
<br />
                     They embraced again….still in the middle of a life threatening battle for all of Norrath
<br />
                     mind you… and as they held each other tightly. Both of them gasped at what they saw
<br />
                     behind each other.
<br />

<br />
                     "Oh..my GODS!!!" She cried out
<br />

<br />
                     "Amazing" he said almost silently…
<br />

<br />
                     They separated and she stood still disbelieving at what she saw…a 50 foot high demon. 
<br />

<br />
                     "uhh….Hon..got any idea on how to stop this?"
<br />

<br />
                     When she got no response, she looked around and realized something. Augustas wasn't
<br />
                     near by any more. She whirled around looking for him, but he was gone.
<br />

<br />
                     "AUGUSTAS!!! WHERE ARE YOU!!" she cried as loud as she could, but still no reply….a
<br />
                     loud thud and the ground shaking turned her back to the demon. It was walking right to
<br />
                     her…she had no idea what to do…..and for the first time, she was actually scared for
<br />
                     her life….She had never really encountered anything truly abnormal like this..and the few
<br />
                     truly weird and dangerous things she did come across…he had always been by her
<br />
                     side…they had never been apart….…but now he was gone…she was
<br />
                     scared……terrified……petrified…
<br />

<br />
                     --------------------------
<br />

<br />
                     "Through a combination of luck and last resorts, we where able to defeat Lans and
<br />
                     destroy that demon she summoned, it had been wearing this amulet." He held up the old
<br />
                     amulet. "At first, I thought your mother had died, but later as we where scouring the
<br />
                     field for wounded, I found her in shivering and in tears…no apparent physical injuries..but
<br />
                     she was never quite the same after that……but that is enough history for now Fry. I
<br />
                     have a mission for you."
<br />

<br />
                     "I'm ready Sir!"
<br />

<br />
                     "Are you sure you don't want to wait until the clerics can finish healing your arm?"
<br />

<br />
                     "I will be fine sir, I want to get to the bottom of this."
<br />

<br />
                     The King smiled. "Good, good. Take these amulets and go to EverFrost Peaks. I'll have
<br />
                     my fastest ship take you to Qeynos, but you will have to make your own way from
<br />
                     there. Once you reach Everfrost, track down and seek the aid of the Wizard Al'Kabor. He
<br />
                     is recluse and does not like dealing with outsiders, but he helped us during the war and
<br />
                     he does owe me some favors for letting him work in my family's private library. Take this
<br />
                     slip from me as proof that you are my errant." 
<br />

<br />
                     He held up a small scroll with the royal seal and mark he had never seen before,
<br />
                     obviously some kind of personal mark that only the King and the great Wizard Al'Kabor
<br />
                     would know. It would be such an honor to be in his presence, the legends and tales
<br />
                     about him where only dwarfed by his great mastery of mana.
<br />

<br />
                     "Get what ever you can from him about these Amulets and see if knows anything about
<br />
                     this Kaiyan'wang. Leave when ever you are ready."
<br />

<br />
                     "By your leave M'lord" Fry picked up the items, bowed and dashed away.
<br />

<br />
                     "I hope for your sake Fry, that he is in a good mood when you meet him."
<br />
                     -------------------
<br />

<br />
                     And so that is how Fry got in his current predicament, currently the maid for "the Great"
<br />
                     Al'kabor…..well almost…..I left out a few minor details…I guess, I should include
<br />
                     those…but it is getting late and once again I am running out of ink…that blasted
<br />
                     merchant is overcharging again…..I ought to show him a thing or too…oh well…hopefully,
<br />
                     I can get a decent supply of ink, so I can continue my husbands tale. So until then my
<br />
                     dear precious….human…yucky…..readers…..I will just have to transpose the events
<br />
                     directly from Al'kabors diaries…with all it's pretty flowers on it ..hehehe..well you will just
<br />
                     have to wait and ponder on why great wizard would have a diary with flowers on
<br />
                     it..hehehehe…Fare well.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

Chapter 4 Frozen Reception: Excerpted From the Diary of Al'Kabor
<br />
-------------
<br />

<br />

<br />
Entry 5 of April 3127
<br />
-----------------------
<br />

<br />

<br />
I find myself in a bad mood of late, my recent experiments have turned sour. Fortunately luck has been on my side in some respects, the gathering of components and the actual testing has been rather easy and swift. My companions, the last of aged Icing Clan of Brownies have been stalwart in there aid to me and I do owe them much..For the first time, in quite some many years I have begun to enjoy some companionship…even though Sprinkles won't…
<br />
-----
<br />
"STOP GROWING FLOWERS ON MY JOURNALS!!!!"
<br />

<br />
The little brownie looked sad and about to cry.
<br />

<br />
"…I just thought you would like it…sniff"
<br />

<br />
"There, there Sprinkles. I do like the flowers, but please not on my journals. But they are too pretty and detract from the knowledge within. So please, grow them someplace else. Hmm."
<br />

<br />
The little Brownie girl smiled. "Okay Boss" and jumped off the table and danced away to another part of the cave.
<br />

<br />
"And not on my wardrobe either Sprinkles!" He called after her
<br />

<br />
-----------------
<br />

<br />
Aside, from the minor inconviences, my time with the Icing Clan has been memorable. I wonder if they would accompany when I depart from Everfrost once my experiments are completed here?
<br />

<br />
Hmm..well it is thought. Ahh, I hear the beaker-beginning whistle, my next test is almost complete. My research continues….
<br />
----------
<br />

<br />
Entry 6 of April  3127
<br />
---------------------
<br />

<br />
Setbacks and more setbacks, last night experiments where a failure. I am now out of testing supplies, I have sent the Brownies out to go search for some more .  My research continues….
<br />

<br />
-------------------
<br />

<br />
Entry 7 of April 3127
<br />
--------------------
<br />

<br />

<br />
A most interesting development has occurred. As the brownies searched the Frozen Tundra for more supplies for my experiments, they found a very young wood elf laying in the snow, half frozen, half dead, most likely due to that flash blizzard last night. Being the gentle creatures they are, they brought the elf back here to save him. At the moment, he is fine, but he seems to have a broken arm, but when Nutmeg inspected him, it seems that the broken bone was caused earlier and not by the blizzard.
<br />

<br />
For right now, he sleeps …in my bed of all places…well, I shouldn't hold it against the Brownies, they care for just about everyone. Well any way, their care has allowed me to inspect the items he had upon his person. It's that this young child, is an officer of Faydwer, though only a lowly Chroito. He also seems to be of the Rogue guild, which suggests I keep a close I upon him.
<br />

<br />
He also was carrying two amulets both bearing the mark I have never seen before and a scroll with a chocolate smudge and the Royal Seal. If, I am to make a guess, I suppose that Tearis is calling in a marker and desires for me to research these amulets. Hmm, but why dispatch a child to deliver this to me, and an injured one at that? My research continues…
<br />

<br />

<br />
Entry 8 of April 3127
<br />
--------------------------
<br />

<br />
The boy woke up this morning, scaring himself and poor Sprinkles half to death.
<br />
--------------------------
<br />

<br />
Sprinkles walked on top of the sleeping Fry, she walked up to his head and stared at his dormant face. She smiled him and preceded to play with him, making various faces, smiley face, grumpy face, boogie-boogie face. After I while she got bored and decided to liven Al'Kabor's room up a bit and began to toss some Flower dust around on the bed, pretty flowers instantly began to grow, at that moment one of Fry's eyes opened groggily and saw a little tiny thing standing on his chest.
<br />

<br />

<br />
'AAAAAAAAHHH!!!!!"
<br />

<br />
His cry scared poor Sprinkles and she screamed too 
<br />

<br />
"EEEEEEEEEEEEK!!!" Flower dust went every where as she hopped off Fry and went running away, flowers sprouting behind her.
<br />

<br />
All the commotion woke up the other brownies and Al'kabor who came charging toward the sound. Al'kabor stormed in the room, in a grumpy mood, he hadn't gotten much sleep and was just dozing off when this all started.
<br />

<br />
"WHAT IS GOING ON IN HERE!!!"
<br />

<br />
"Monster!"
<br />

<br />
"Where?" as he panned around the room, he noticed the flowers. "Sprinkles!!!"
<br />

<br />
The timid little brownie stuck her head around the corner. "Yes boss?"
<br />

<br />
"What where you doing?"
<br />

<br />
"sniff..I was just checking on him, when he stared hooting and hollering and scared me…I dropped my dust pouch because of him…sniff"
<br />

<br />
"I see." Al'kabor turnedback to Fry who was puzzled by all of this. "I expect you to have all of this mess cleaned up and since you are awake now..GET OUT OF MY BED!!!" he boomed
<br />

<br />
Fry did so nearly falling in the process. Al'Kabor fumed a bit and left the room to get back to his work. Fry still completely baffled by everything, put his uniform back on and proceeded to clean up the large array of flowers strewn across the room.
<br />

<br />
"I'm sorry I scared you" said Sprinkles still warily peering around the corner.
<br />

<br />
"It's okay, I guess I scared you well too."
<br />

<br />
"Yeah…oh, my name is Sprinkles of the Icing Brownie clan. What is your name?"
<br />

<br />
"Fry."
<br />

<br />
"oooh nice name."
<br />

<br />
Another Brownie peered around the cornor just above Sprinkles. "Heeeello" another popped above the previous. "Helllo!" and yet another popped up "Helllooooo!" and another "heeeellooooo!" and yet another "Heeeeeeelllllloo!" And then all six of them together in a chorus "Helllllo!"
<br />

<br />
Sprinkles giggled "I love that, this are my brothers and sisters The Last of Icing Brownies" she cart wheeled out into the open
<br />

<br />
"Sprinkles!" another one cart wheeled out beside her "Nutmeg!" another beside Nutmeg "Chocolate!" The fourth hopped upon the previous threes shoulders. "Butter!" the next did the same standing beside Butter. The last leapt into the air and landed on top of Butter and Chocolate, finishing the Brownie triangle "BOB!" Then they all cheered, "We are Clan Icing!! TADA!!!"
<br />

<br />

<br />
Fry giggled and applauded the acrobatic brownies, but was interrupted by Al'kabor.
<br />

<br />
"QUIT THAT MESS AND YOU BOY GET OUT HERE!!"
<br />

<br />
The brownies quickly got out of the triangle and muttered amongst themselves.
<br />

<br />
"Boss, is grumpy."
<br />
"We should hide"
<br />
"He is scary when he is grumpy"
<br />

<br />
All six vanished.
<br />

<br />
Fry timidly walked out of the room and found Al'Kabor staring at some beakers obviously in a bad mood.
<br />

<br />
"Now, tell me why are you here boy?"
<br />

<br />
"I was sent here sir, by King Tearis Thex to ask you to looked at some amulets we recovered in our territories, and to see if you could analyze them and possibly tell us anything you know about a God named Kaiyan'Wang."
<br />

<br />
"Hmm. Just as I thought, he was calling in a marker….Well, boy, you certainly have proven to be a disruption this morning. So, take this note and go bring me these materials I need for my experiments and maybe I will consider honoring this. Now go!"
<br />

<br />
Fry was somewhat stunned..but complied, taking his cloak and the note he set off out into the Tundra for Al'kabors supplies…and it would not be the last time either..
<br />

<br />
---------------------
<br />

<br />
Well, at least now I have him out of my hair…If I had any, well any way. With him out of my home, I can continue my work undisturbed…or so I thought. I am an honorable person, so while he was off , I looked into those amulets. The metal is ordinary gold and platinum, and the gem is mostly ordinary as well. It does seem to have some magical properties but at the moment, I have not discerned it. Oh well, I will shortly. My library and my knowledge will crack this rapidly as it does all problems. My research continues..
<br />

<br />
Entry 23 of April 3127
<br />
----------------------------
<br />

<br />
For the first time in my life, I am completely befuddled by these amulets and this recluse god Kaiyan'wang. My searched have turned up empty and in vain, unbelievable..O well, at least things have been running smoothly with the boy. He complies with my orders well enough and does a fair enough job in completing them. But unfortunately this damned marker is cutting into my other research! I have never been so clueless until now…but luck was on my side today, for a new wealth of information cam from a surprising and small package…
<br />

<br />
----------------------------
<br />

<br />
Al'kabor scratched his head as his last test on the amulets came negative. He sat down and held them in his hands, wondering what he should try next. 
<br />

<br />
"Boss..can I come in?" Sprinkles asked shyly. Over last several weeks aside from going out to bark orders at Fry or to eat, Al'kabor had been in his lab and isolated himself from even his companions the Brownies. Until today, they hadn't attempted to talk to him; they knew how he could be when he was concentrating on his research.
<br />

<br />
Al'kabor sighed heavily still befuddled and leaned back in his chair "Yes, come in Sprinkles." Tiny feet shuffled across the floor and then he could feel the addition of her miniscule weight on the back of his chair, and then his back and then the top of his head. He rolled his eyes up to look at the brownie,  that was now lying on the top of his head.
<br />

<br />
"Whatcha working on Boss."
<br />

<br />
"Trying to determine the magical properties in the gems of these amulets and the relation if any to a god named Kaiyan'wang."
<br />

<br />
"EEEEK!!!" The brownie screamed and cowered slightly.
<br />

<br />
"What? What is it Sprinkles?"
<br />

<br />
"That name…sniff…HE is evil……if those amulets are related to HIM…..get rid of them please boss."
<br />

<br />
"What is wrong?"
<br />

<br />
She remained silent for a few moments,deciding on whether or not to tell him, but finally relented and told him the brownie Legend of Creation.
<br />

<br />
"Eternities ago, the divine being Overbeast created the universe, and bestowed life to countless planets, including Norrath, but where there is a creature of light, there is one of darkness, where there is a god..there is a devil..that devil is Kaiyan'wang. Kaiyan'wang was fiercly jealous of the Overbeast for it's ability of creation and started a war with her for many thousands of years, but luckily the Overbeast triumphed, but sadly the war had drained her and could not destroy Kaiyan'wang. So she imprisoned HIM in stone and cast HIM  to the cosmos until her power was restored and she could get rid of HIM forever. It is said among the brownie clans, that the statue containing Kaiyan'wang eventually crashed here on Norrath thousands of years ago and the coming of HIM heralded the end of the greatest light of Norrath in that time, the Combine Kingdom.
<br />

<br />
The coming of HIM, also was the herald of the creation….of us….the Brownies. It is said that back then, the Brownies where of one clan, all loyal to serving HIM, but for some reason they broke up into the many clans of today, each with a legend of HIM..passed down through each generation..some still worship the dark power, others like Clan Icing do not and fear the return of HIM …so please Boss get rid of those Amulets!"
<br />

<br />
Al'Kabor could feel her tremble as she told the tale, and usually did not pay attention to such silly tales, but for some reason he believed Sprinkles and would get rid of them as soon as possible. Just as soon as was done compiling everything into a letter for the boy to take back to Tearis.
<br />
--------------------------
<br />

<br />
An amazing revelation, so much I did not know about the brownies, so interesting ..well I must work on that letter to Tearis. My work continues…
<br />

<br />
----------------------------
<br />

<br />
Entry 24 of April 3127
<br />
-------------------------------
<br />

<br />
The letter is compiled and ready to be delivered but unfortunately a little bit too late, I think my anger over the interruption in my work and my incessant demands has finally worn the last of the boy's patience.
<br />

<br />
----------------------------
<br />

<br />

<br />
"Boy, come here!"
<br />

<br />
"No.."
<br />

<br />
"!?! COME HERE WHEN I CALL YOU BOY!!!"
<br />

<br />
"NO!!!!  Why don't you go polish your head or something chrome dome!!!!"
<br />
---------------------
<br />

<br />
Normally, I do not let myself be pulled down into name calling, but I fear; I am rather sensitive about my hair or lack there of.
<br />

<br />
---------------------
<br />

<br />
"You insolent whelp!!!!"
<br />

<br />
"You geeky conehead!!!"
<br />

<br />
The brownies heard the shouting and listened in gasping as the two called each other names.
<br />

<br />
"You obnoxious pointy ear!!!!"
<br />

<br />
"YOUR MAMA WAS A GNOME!!!!"
<br />

<br />
The brownies gasped as Al'Kabor began to fume…and then he smiled and began to roar with laughter, Fry began to snicker and then joined in as they both laughed at the complete silliness of there insults.
<br />
----------------------
<br />
Interesting how insulting each other, finally broke the barrier of annoyance between us. As we talk, really for the first time . I learned a lot of interesting things about this young child Fry. Also learned something startling, he was the child of Augustas Menlore! I felt ashamed at this revelation, my poor treatment of this child, the son of the man who saved my life during  the War of Heroes. I would hope to make it up to him…one day…but I was yearning to get back to my research and he wanted to return to Felwithe to make his report. So I gave him the scroll and the amulets..much to Sprinkles relief and set off into the cold snow, and wasn't 6 minutes later that I got another visitor, a dark elf girl. She was wearing a cloak, with an amulet acting as button to hold together.
<br />
---------------------
<br />
"No visitors!"
<br />

<br />
"I am not here to visit, I am here to worn you Al'Kabor. Stop your meddling with the affairs of Kaiyan'wang!"
<br />

<br />
"I do not know what you are talking about, so be gone from my home!"
<br />

<br />
"As long as you understand."And the girl precede to through bag containing some explosives into the cave, the bag burst open and small beads began to fly everywhere, but because of the shape of the cave, most of them rolled downward into the laboratory. There was a loud explosion and the lab was nearly totaled.
<br />

<br />
Al'kabor was stunned…and then furious..the only thing that upset him more then interrupting his work was the destruction of knowledge. His eyes flashes with power a lightning bolt leapt from his hands and streaked toward the girl and was promptly deflected by barrier.
<br />
----------------------------
<br />

<br />
I didn't notice until then when my bolt was deflected, that the amulet was just like the one Fry had brought to me. It was protecting her from my magic, which put me in a bad situation, or so I thought, the brownies, my friends saw what happened and surprised me yet again.
<br />

<br />
-----------------------------
<br />

<br />
The Brownies leapt upon each other's shoulders, forming the Brownie triangle. Bob ontop held out his tiny arms and shouted. "BROWNIE POWER!!"
<br />

<br />
The six brownies began to glow and then there was a flash and the six tiny brownies where replaced by a large 12 foot brownie. The dark elf girl stepped back, surprised by this, this was new to her and to Al'Kabor..a 12 foot …Brownie?
<br />

<br />
The large Brownie made a war cry and charged at the girl and promptly whacked it's head on the low ceiling a the entrance, it crashed to the ground and disappeared, replaced by the six tiny brownies that made up Clan icing..
<br />

<br />

<br />
"….Ow…" said Bob
<br />
"Next time, Im on top" said Butter
<br />

<br />
Al'Kabor shocked his head and the dark elf girl just giggled at this development.
<br />
---------------------------
<br />

<br />
They tried, I guess in the heat of the moment they forgot how tall they where, but even so it provided the distraction needed..
<br />
---------------------------
<br />

<br />
The Dark elf Girl tried to dodge but was unsuccessful leapt out of nowhere with his daggers at bear and sliced off the amulet she was wearing. At that moment, Al'Kabor launched another spell at the girl.
<br />

<br />
"Now you die meddler!!"
<br />

<br />
"NO!!" Fry bounded in front of the bolt and at the last second Al'kabor canceled the lethal spell, Fry  stared at the girl who was once again surprised. Again the two met..Fry stared at Sevet unsure of what to do..she was so pretty…why couldn't he let any harm come to her…why did he feel so attracted to her? A dark elf?
<br />

<br />
Sevet also wondered this, but came out of her daze quicker and leapt above Fry and began to rapidly scale the mountain with the deftness and precision that only a Scout could do.
<br />

<br />
------------------------
<br />
I don't know what that boy was thinking, why did he jump in  my way to protect that dark elf? And a servant of Kaiyan'wang on top of that? I don't know, I will have to ask him when he wakes up later. He went charging after the girl and I was too downcast about the destruction of my lab to go after them, but the Brownies when they woke up followed their trail up the mountain face and found Fry at the scene of mighty duel unconscious in the snow. Well, I guess I will have to start cleaning…My work continues…
<br />

<br />
-------------------------
<br />
Hi!!! It's me, I don't have much ink and unfortunately I don't have Al'Kabor's journal discussing what happened to Fry after he went after Sevet. So I will, let's just hope my ink doesn't run out…darn that merchant.
<br />
----------------------------
<br />

<br />
Sevet ran as fast as she could, up the mountain face and came across a patch of flat land, she rushed as fast as he could, but she could her footfalls behind her in the snow.
<br />

<br />
"You aren't getting away!" Fry called after her. Sevet turned around and charged him and they locked dagger-to-dagger testing each others strength trying to out power each other, trying to make the other fall…Who would make the fatal lapse? It was Sevet..Fry was strong and he knocked away her left dagger and pushed her too the ground, he pounced on top of her, keeping her right away from him and  he held up his left to make the kill…..but he couldn't….he couldn't kill…no one…Fry just could not take a life…especially her…
<br />

<br />
He relaxed and let her go and stood to walk away, she was not as forgiving. She crashed into him sending him skidding in the cold snow his daggers going in a different direction, as he came to a stop she pounced upon him. She rolled him over so she could look in his eyes and held her dagger up to take his life….but instead she put the dagger down and kissed Fry passionately. When she broke the kiss, she smiled and clocked him upside the head sending Fry's world into darkness.
