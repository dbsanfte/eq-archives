I think it's hogwash. Do you? 
<br />

<br />
For someone who knows so little about what's going on in the world around him, you certainly do have some steadfast opinions. Perhaps you should consider doing a little research about those opinions before blabbing them all over the place and convincing everyone of what an idiot you are.</td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody">

<br />
I am well aware of what's going on in the world.  That's why I'm here.  I care about the situation.  I care about the extreme polarization of the country.  I care that many Americans are more concerned with hindering the civil rights of fellow citizens that don't happen to worship the same supernatural figments or have the same sexual orientation they do.  I am concerned that that this board mimics the national landscape where those who don't agree with the ignorant mass are treated like the terrorists themselves.
<br />

<br />
I'm not going to review every post on this board for historical perspective.  I was simply participating in a discussion.  I've posted here before I had hoped that with new ownership that some things might have changed.  Obviously, there are a lot of people here with a death grip on the board and seemingly endless amounts of time to verbally destroy anyone with a dissenting opinion.  I have not and will not personally attack anyone here.  I don't know any of you and you certainly don't know me, but I can tell you that I don't deserve to be called an idiot or a tree hugger and neither do you.  
<br />

<br />
I choose to throw my head on the chopping block because I'm not going to bullied into acquiescing to an administration I find morally and socially reprehensible.  I am not a genius, nor do I have every report in front of me.  No amount of invented statistics or bogus reports can change the fact that this war is NOT about protecting this country from a WMD attack from a third world country or protecting Iraqi citizens.  Jesus Christ.  Who buys this stuff?  Who believes this crap?  Who really, genuinely believes that George Bush and his self-described elite base are in Iraq to protect us when all this war has done destroyed our standing in the world and led to never-before-seen levels of anti-Americanism?  Democracy in Iraq?  You won't see it in your lifetime and neither will I -- at least I admit that I know it.
<br />

<br />
You can call everyone who doesn't agree with you every name in the book, but it doesn't make you right.  And honestly, I didn't post to be right, just to opine to a group of people who use a shield of internet anonymity to be hateful and beligerent.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

Wha?? How am I, a Bush supporter and supporter of the war in Iraq, hindering the civil rights of any citizen, regardless of thier beliefs? How am I, a devout atheist, worshiping any supernatural figments at all? Much less those of the people whom I support? How am I, a hetorosexual who understands and can relate to and support same sex marriage be against the very idea of what I understand and support?
<br />

<br />
And how can you, who knows so very little about what I believe and have faith in, and why I do so, be so eager to tell me that I am wrong when you don't even know what or why or how I believe in?
<br />

<br />
Who are these "many Americans" you speak so generally about? And why would you direct your dissapointment to this board, whish is educated, civil in disagreement, and fruitful in thought, and at the very least supportive of rational argument and supporting one's beliefs whether they be the same or different as the majority? 
<br />

<br />
You behave as a 19 year old idealist who just stumbled on his first <span style="font-style: italic">far</span> right message board. Let's get something straight, junior. There may be a few here who are self-proclaimed die-hard Republicans. There are also those who are self-proclaimed, die-hard Democrats. They agree to disagree and can discuss things rationally, look at each other's data, point of veiw, and other contributing factors, and still get along. You don't fit into that category. You are not informed enough to be able to. I don't mean that as an insult, but I'm quite sure you'll take it that way because you are defensive. Good for you. Do you even know what you are defensive about? I think the answer to that question is obvious.
<br />

<br />

<br />
I am concerned about your posts for two reasons.
<br />

<br />
One, I am concerned that you say this board accuses those who disagree to be ignorant in the mass, which is precicely the excercize of those whom you support do on a daily basis, and to an extreme degree. We only pinpoint ignorance. Not just in those who disagree, but in those who agree. Ignorance is a lack of knowledge or comprehension. It is <span style="font-weight: bold">not</span> your support of one side or another that makes you ignorant, it's your reasons why (or lack thereof). It's the lack of knowledge that led you to your beliefs that cause doubts of your beliefs, not the beliefs themselves.
<br />

<br />

<br />
I am also concerned that you would refer to any American, whether he believe the same as you or not, is someone you would liken to a terrorist. Why would that even be a label that would come to your mind? I'm quite sure it didn't. I'm almost positive you read that eleswhere and though it to be a tidy and poiniant phrase.
<br />

<br />
I've got news, it's not. It sounds very "buzz-wordish" and trigger happy. I could turn the automatic rifle around and say you were like a terrorist for not believing in and supporting the war on terror. That would be untrue, so I don't. Those who oppose the war are not comparable to terrorists. Those who support the war are not comparable to terrorists. Nobody can be compared to terrorists except for terrorists. It's like analogizing Bill O'Reilly to Dan Rather. Can't be done unless you take some serious liberties.
<br />

<br />
..oh wait, you already did that.
<br />

<br />
</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" border="0" align="center"><tr> 	  <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>	</tr>	<tr>	  <td class="quote"> Obviously, there are a lot of people here with a death grip on the board and seemingly endless amounts of time to verbally destroy anyone with a dissenting opinion.</td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
It's not your opinion I disagree with most. It's your lack of reasoning and proof for the opinion. There are a few here who disagree, but can say in a very direct, unemotional manner why they disagree. That gets a nod. That gets an "I see" comment. That gets the tagline "we agree to disagree." There are also those here who agree, and who have proven to be able to articulate, not with large words or insults, why they disagree. That also gets an "i see" comment, a nod, and sometimes even a hug.
<br />

<br />
Waltzing in here with very little for many of us to have basis for your opinion upon anything, while painting everything in red or blue, love or hate, live or die colors is going to get some encouragement for you to explain "why" you feel such animosity and contempt.
<br />

<br />
I hope I was more clear this time.

<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">I see no evidence of this so far. Still waiting for you to back up your assertion that the US military is only authorized by the Constitution to protect the US citizenry. I expect I'll be waiting a long time, too, as you cannot.</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">That's why I'm here. </span> 
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">Oh, I doubt that very much. You come here to attempt to proselytize your views, and when that fails you come back here to whine and to make indirect sidestepping insults about those who disagree with you. Show me any evidence to the contrary.
<br />

<br />
A direct insult is more honest, and wastes far less time.</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">I care about the situation.  I care about the extreme polarization of the country.  I care that many Americans are more concerned with hindering the civil rights of fellow citizens that don't happen to worship the same supernatural figments or have the same sexual orientation they do.</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">For someone who claims to be so concerned about civil rights, you sure seem very interested in preventing others from expressing their beliefs freely.
<br />

<br />
But then, you only see value in free expression that you approve of, don't you?
<br />

<br />
Here's a big thought for you - lift it carefully so you don't strain anything: Heterosexual males and heterosexual females do <span style="text-decoration: underline">not</span> have the "same sexual orientation." The former is gynophylic (as are lesbian females), and the latter is androphylic (as are gay males). Homosexual activists, on the other hand, do exhibit this behavior you decry of only agreeing with those of the same sexual orientation.
<br />

<br />
Think not? Back it up. Better go look up the root definitions of "hetero" and "homo" first, though.
<br />

<br />
You claim to 'care' an awful lot, about an awful lot... but what have you actually DONE to change any of this?
<br />

<br />
Besides bitch, I mean?</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">  I am concerned that that this board mimics the national landscape where those who don't agree with the ignorant mass are treated like the terrorists themselves.</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">Are you claiming that "ignorant mass" is not a personal insult against the people in the board who share the veiw on which you are commenting?
<br />

<br />
The insinuation that <span style="text-decoration: underline">your</span> demonstrated behavior of only insulting people in broad groups and over specious stereotypes, is somehow morally superior to insulting individuals directly for their own words and deeds, makes no sense whatsoever and only proves your inability to meet even your own lackluster standards of propriety.
<br />
</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">I'm not going to review every post on this board for historical perspective.  I was simply participating in a discussion.  I've posted here before I had hoped that with new ownership that some things might have changed.</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">Translated: You had hoped that your changing your name (again), and the change of management, would somehow have gained you more slack for your illogical petty political peeves and pedantic proselytizing pap than you had experienced previously, having made you own bed here several times previously.
<br />

<br />
Happy to disappoint you.</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Obviously, there are a lot of people here with a death grip on the board and seemingly endless amounts of time to verbally destroy anyone with a dissenting opinion.</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">Translated: Oh, s**t, they're still here and they remember me.
<br />

<br />
PS; it's not done 'verbally' when its done in print.  Perhaps you were talking with your hands? Some kind of <span style="font-weight: bold">affected</span> pattern of expression?</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">I have not and will not personally attack anyone here.</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">Untruth. See above re: "Ignorant mass" and your insinuations of sexual and religious intolerance on the part of members of this board. Just because you don't have the personal honesty (while disparaging others' anonymity, forsooth) to name those you wish to denegrate does not make your smarmy snipes any less 'personal."
<br />

<br />
And are you forgetting our previous dance? It seems you are...
<br />

<br />
Of course, you no doubt feel that you have adequately 'covered' yourself with the prevarication of "anyone <span style="text-decoration: underline">here</span>" to allow you feel free to personally insult George Bush, his administration, Bill O'Reilly, and Rush Limbaugh... none of whom do you 'personally know,' I'm certain. Yet you feel free to insult them... which AFAIAC makes <span style="text-decoration: underline">you</span> fair game.</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">I don't know any of you and you certainly don't know me, but I can tell you that I don't deserve to be called an idiot or a tree hugger and neither do you.</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">Well, obviously <span style="text-decoration: underline">we</span> don't... but as the shoe fits, get used to wearing it, oh semi-seditious sissy.</span>
<br />

<span style="font-weight: bold">I choose to throw my head on the chopping block because I'm not going to bullied into acquiescing to an administration I find morally and socially reprehensible.</span>

The people who don't like us, well, considering the list, I'm happier with it that way - -starting with you and working outward. But then, I've never been much for the 'sycophant' view of friendship.
<br />

<br />
The people worthy of our trust are standing with us. That's good enough for me. The others seem mainly to have been shown to me theiving disgraceful hypocrites, war profiteers, and cowards, and I'd just as soon not associate with them anyway.</span>

You do realize that the people who predicted exactly the same thing, for exactly the same reasons, regarding Afghanistan - - were exactly as wrong as you are going to be in less than 90 days.

I guess it gives them meaning of a sort.</span>

You seem to have  a real issue with this 'anonymity' deal (though again here you are wrong as several members here are not anonymous at all), so how about you post your real name, address, phone number, current employer (if any, which I doubt profusely) right in that response you're just aching to make to my commentary?
<br />

<br />
What? You don't want to?
<br />

<br />
Why look at your profile: Totally anonymous...</span>

Again, you're not the first person to come to this board, post lots of generalities and thinly-supported (or unsupported) statements, then fallen back on the complaint that you're being persecuted for daring to speak up, when you're asked to provide a bit more than just platitudes and pithy phrases.

Anonymity doesn't really protect you or us from a proper presentation of thoughts, ideas, and most importantly facts and reason.  Insults, both outright and thinly-veiled, protect no one from a careful examination of our words and opinions.  I also think that you simply wanted to stand on your soapbox, lecture us for a bit with some fancy phrases you've picked up recently, then watch as chaos and confusion ensued amongst the evil, ignorant masses.
<br />

<br />
I think you should've been better prepared than that, and the opportunity is still there if you want to grab that "long list" you referred to, or if you want to peruse the discussions of the last few weeks or months.  If you just want to toss opinions at us, that's fine as well, but why would you seem so intolerant towards the idea that we might toss back some of our own?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

The Education of Dan Rather 
<br />
From the golden age of network TV to the end of its hegemony. 
<br />

<br />
Thursday, December 2, 2004 12:01 a.m. EST 
<br />

<br />
Life is complicated, people are complicated, and most of us are a jumble of virtues, flaws and contradictions. I like to try to understand the past, try to put it together in a way that makes sense to me. This can involve judging not only your own actions and decisions but those of others, which can be hard. I have a friend who once said in the middle of a conversation, "Don't understand me too quickly." Don't categorize me; don't decide you broke the code. Sit back and watch; it's more interesting than you may know. 
<br />

<br />
Which gets me to Dan Rather, who was once my boss, and who of course has announced his retirement from the anchor chair at CBS News. Everyone I know is asking me what I think of it. I think a lot of things.
<br />

<br />
I'm going to use the past tense in speaking of him because I'm speaking of his career, and speaking of when I knew him in the past. 
<br />

<br />
My first thought: It is a hard world. We all know this in the abstract, but it can take you aback in the particular. In public life the entire body of your work--an entire career of almost 50 years--can now essentially be summed up and dismissed by the last headline on your career, which in this case is "Rather Retires Under Cloud After Forged Documents Story." If Dan had retired of his own volition a year ago, that would not be the headline. "Long Career Reflected Stunning Rise of U.S. Media" would be more like it. 
<br />

<br />
I am not saying timing is everything, although it can be rather a lot. I'm thinking of . . . well, Richard Nixon. Nixon had one of the great gutsy careers in American political history, and on the greatest issue of his lifetime--the ugliness and destructiveness of communism here and abroad--he was right, and put his career on the line. He did much good. But his headline is Watergate. 
<br />

<br />
I think the bitterness of Nixon's presidential years, the personal darkness he seemed to display, was in part a product of simple human pain, and the pain was the result of this: He had been right and brave and done the right thing in the 1950s, and the American left and its cousin the American establishment would never forgive him for it. And he couldn't stop wanting their approval. He put a traitor named Alger Hiss in jail. The left would make him pay. He paid the price in terms of his personal peace. He handed his enemies a sword. 
<br />

<br />
One of those who picked it up and used it against him was Dan Rather. There is an amazing and unseen circularity to life. And wanting approval can make you do strange things. 
<br />

<br />
Dan was a great boss. He was appreciative of good work and sympathetic when it wasn't good. He was one of the men--Douglas Edwards and Dallas Townsend were two others--to whom I am indebted, for they taught me how to write for the ear, how to write for people who are listening as opposed to reading. He was generous with praise. Someone who did a good job on a story got flowers and a note. Someone in the newsroom once knocked Dan in a magazine profile, saying he was insecure, always sending too many flowers. Dan thought, Really? Life's tough, you can't send too many flowers! He was open to ideas, he was democratic and not hierarchical in his management style, and he tried to be fair in his dealings with people in spite of a personal emotionalism that was deep, ever present and not entirely predictable. 
<br />

<br />
For three years, from 1981 through 1984, I wrote his daily radio commentary, a four-minute essay with a one-minute spot that went out to all the CBS affiliates and network-owned stations. It was a great job. We did some good work. Here's how it got done: When I had been doing the show for a few weeks I could see that my work was not good--uneven, without voice, without a clear point of view. I thought I knew the reason. I had become increasingly a political conservative. Dan, it was obvious to me, was a sort of establishment liberal--not a wild leftist and not an ideologue, but whatever smart liberals thought was more or less what he wound up thinking, and saying. I couldn't write his views well, because I didn't buy them and didn't fully understand them. I couldn't write my views, because the show had to reflect his thinking. So I went to him and told him my problem. He was great. He said: On any given issue that we discuss, give the liberal point of view fairly and give the conservative point of view fairly, and then we'll end it with my opinion, because it's my show. I thought that sounded good. 
<br />

<br />
And it worked. "Dan Rather Reporting" actually got something of a conservative following, not because it was a conservative show--it wasn't--but because it actually put forward the conservative point of view in what might be called a fair and balanced way. At CBS News in those days that was surprising.
<br />

<br />
CBS then was full of people who liked to argue about who opposed the Vietnam war first, this producer or that reporter. It was a matter of pride who was antiwar first. On the night in 1980 when Ronald Reagan beat Jimmy Carter in a landslide, and brought with him a Republican Senate, CBS News, a busy hive full of people charged with telling America the news at a dramatic moment, was like a morgue. I was happy, and the blue-collar workers--the cameramen who were bringing up families on Long Island, the secretaries from Queens--were delirious. Finally someone would lower their taxes--payroll taxes on overtime were killing them--and stop the humiliation in Iran. But the white-collar workers, the producers and writers and on-air talent--oh what a sad and depressed lot they were. The forces of evil had won.
<br />

<br />
Two things to be said here. One is that CBS News hasn't changed that much, and the other is that the media world in which it operates has changed completely. The whole context has changed. No one has to accept the enforced corporate liberalism of the networks anymore, as they did from 1950 through 1990. They have options, from cable to Fox to the Internet to hundreds and thousands of radio shows, newspapers, magazines. The old network hegemony is over. That's why network news viewership is down, that's why the evening news isn't appointment TV anymore. America didn't turn crazily right, Americans just finally got political options in how they'd get the news, and took advantage of them. 
<br />

<br />
Dan Rather's career traces all this. He rose as network TV rose, rose in the age of Cronkite, and when he took Mr. Cronkite's chair it was front-page news. He was one of the three men in America who'd tell the entire country the news. It was big stuff. 
<br />

<br />
Along the way, on the way, he had his dramas. He was the young reporter at Parkland Memorial Hospital who got word from a priest that JFK was dead. He had it first. He covered the civil rights era down South in the 1960s--an insufficiently appreciated shaper of the views of young reporters of Dan's generation. They saw white men in uniforms use fire hoses on young blacks; they saw black people trying to get a cup of coffee at the counter at Woolworth's punched and dragged away; they covered the bombing of the Birmingham church, and the funerals of the little girls who died there. (Nine-year-old Condi Rice, who lived nearby, could have been one of them.) The civil rights struggle seared everyone, but few more than the young reporters who covered it, and few, I think, more than Dan. 
<br />

<br />
So did Vietnam, from which Dan reported, again at personal risk. Another perhaps insufficiently appreciated fact: Part of the bitterness of Vietnam was the bitterness of those who were risking their lives in the fight on the ground only to perceive, day by day, that their government, and its Clark Cliffords and other shrewd operators, were pulling the plug on the war and not fighting to win. In Washington they were trying to escape with their careers and reputations intact. On the ground in country, as they used to say, they were trying to escape with their lives. Imagine how you'd feel if you were a grunt losing your friends as all this became clearer day by day. And imagine what it was like to be young Dan, listening to those grunts each day.
<br />

<br />
And then Watergate. More and more I think that scandal will be remembered as a kind of hysteria, a virus that jumped from reporter to reporter, newsroom to newsroom, raising temperatures to fever pitch. Dan was one of the reporters who went after Nixon, et al., with a vengeance. Looking back one might ask: Why? 
<br />

<br />
For a mix of reasons. Because it was good for business. Because it drove up "Evening News" numbers. Because there was blood in the air. Because Watergate seemed to illustrate what reporters knew, just knew, was the secret truth residing in Richard Nixon's dark heart: a desire for enemies lists and break-ins and IRS reviews. Because it built up reporters as white knights, and reporters really didn't mind being seen as white knights. Because it was exciting, and black and white. The good guys were Democrats, investigators, special counsels and journalists looking for The Truth. The bad: Nixon, Republicans, anyone who worked for Nixon except a good source, Charles Colson, then a wild man, and G. Gordon Liddy, a wild man to this day.
<br />

<br />
If you were a young Dan Rather you knew which side was the side to be on. You knew which side your bosses were on. You knew which side would lead to your rise. And you knew which side would win.
<br />

<br />
It wasn't exactly complicated. Every conservative in America in the last century, especially in the media and in the colleges, knew they would be dinged and damaged if they held to their beliefs. Every liberal in the media and the academy knew they could rise if they espoused liberal views. Dan wanted to rise.
<br />

<br />
Probably the worst moment in his career, because it was arguably the one most obvious in showing bias and a political agenda, was the time Dan tried to beat up George H.W. Bush live, on the "CBS Evening News," over Iran-contra. Mr. Bush decked him instead, and with a question that reverberates: How would you like your whole career to be judged by one mistake? I do not doubt that CBS News that night thought it was going to take down a vice president, and wanted to. And was embittered by its failure. Which may have contributed to the years long, Ahab-like quest of producer Mary Mapes to bring down George W. Bush with documents it took bloggers less than 24 hours to reveal as fabrications.
<br />

<br />
And yet. Dan Rather was one of the great breaking-news reporters of our time. Hurricanes, earthquakes, big sudden stuff--he loved it, and he knew how to cover it. A friend reminded me of the beauty with which Dan asked for silence as CBS's cameras lingered on the sun going down on quake-ravaged San Francisco in 1989. And I think of his delicate coverage of stories like Princess Diana's funeral. 
<br />

<br />
I don't think Dan Rather ever saw himself as being destructive in his views and biases when the story of the night was political. He always seemed to me to love America, was moved, always, by those who fight for it. He respected the armed forces and their sacrifices. He surprised me one day by reciting from heart and with tears in his eyes the last letter of Travis at the Alamo. And there was the time, after 9/11, when he went on David Letterman's show and, in speaking of the heroism of what he'd seen at Ground Zero and the tragedy of it, burst into sobs. He felt it. Anyone who felt 9/11 down to his bones--well, who's to gainsay that? 
<br />

<br />
Ultimately this is what I think was true about Dan and his career. It's not very nice but I think it is true. He was a young, modestly educated Texas boy from nowhere, with no connections and a humble background. He had great gifts, though: physical strength, attractiveness, ambition, commitment and drive. He wanted to be a star. He was willing to learn and willing to pay his dues. He covered hurricanes and demonstrations, and when they got him to New York they let him know, as only an establishment can, what was the right way to think, the intelligent enlightened way, the Eastern way, the Ivy League way, the Murrow School of Social Justice way. They let him know his simple Texan American assumptions were not so much wrong as not fully thought through, not fully nuanced, not fully appreciative of the multilayered nature of international political realities. He swallowed it whole.
<br />

<br />
 
<br />
He had a strong Texas accent, but they let him know he wasn't in Texas anymore. I remember once a nice man, an executive producer, confided in me that he'd known Dan from the early days, from when he first came up to New York. He laughed, not completely unkindly, and told me Dan wore the wrong suits. I wish I could remember exactly what he said but it was something like, "He had a yellow suit!" There was a sense of: We educated him. Dan wound up in pinstripe suits made in London. Like Cyrus Vance. Like Clark Clifford. He got educated. He fit right in. And much of what he'd learned--from the civil rights movement, from Vietnam and from Watergate--allowed him to think he was rising in the right way and with the right crew and the right thinking.
<br />

<br />
People are complicated, careers are complicated, motives are complicated. Dan Rather did some great work on stories that demanded physical courage. He loved the news, and often made it look like the most noble of enterprises. He had guts and fortitude. Those stories he covered that touched on politics were unfortunately and consistently marred by liberal political bias, and in this he was like too many in his profession. But this is changing. The old hegemony has given way. The old dominance is over. Good thing. Great thing. Onward.

<br />
To this I would add: I find it odd that the same people who wish to so excoriate President Bush for the failings of the worldwide intelligence network with regard to the extent of Iraq's ready-to-launch WMD capacity because 'he's the man in charge,' are also so willing to try to sweep aside and dismiss a TV network news agency's MANAGING DIRECTOR's responsibility for the "years long, Ahab-like quest" of his chief producer to bring down the sitting President of the United States on the basis of a totally false and personally offensive lie.
<br />

<br />
To me, that smacks of a most curious bias.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<br />
The regulars in this space are generally guilty of neither.
<br />

<br />
They have dismantled your posts, Entropae, with logical arguments.
<br />

<br />
We are open to logical responses. There are liberals here amongst the conservatives (I think of myself as more centrist myself, at least in the two-party landscape) and they are respected and their posts are given weight.
<br />

<br />
People often still disagree but the logical dismantling of the fluff, rhetoric, and hyperbole surrounding positions generally exposes an understandable basic philosophical difference. When this is exposed, people generally are able to agree to disagree and coexist without malice here. Debates run spirited, but seldom personal. Emotions flare, but seldom tempers.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
You reenter this space with a torrent of irrational unoriginal hyperbolic rhetoric from one side of the political spectrum, are predictably whacked upside the head with the 4x4 of factual counterarguments, and then whine that you are picked upon and shouldnt be expected to know the veracity of the information which you repeat.
<br />

<br />
Sorry, the information you bring to the table is your responsibility to defend or abandon. This is logical, rational, and correct. Your arguments to the contrary are petulant and unmoving.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Fact: The US government, along with the governments of most other nations with credible foreign intelligence agencies and the UN, believed that Iraq had WMD and was behaving in an uncooperative fashion with the inspectors which directly implies concealment.
<br />

<br />
Logical conclusion: Therefore, the US government didnt lie to the US people about WMD. They simply passed the information available along to them. This information turned out to be largely incorrect, in the end, but because information that was believed to be true was passed along to the people seeking information there can have been no lie.
<br />

<br />
Fact: Dan Rathers position of unbiased news anchor is fundamentally different from Bill OReillys position as conservative talk show host and commentator.
<br />

<br />
Logical conclusion: Argumentative analogy of these two positions is pointless.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Lets look at just one of your paragraphs:

<br />
That you are well aware of whats going on in the world and that this is why you are present is a relative statement. The signal to noise ratio in your posts would indicate that your knowledge of the facts of what is going on in the world is either lacking, or you dont care.

<br />
If you care about the situation, Id encourage you to develop your own opinions and positions about it based upon the facts and conditions rather than parroting the extreme positions of some who try to increase the polarization within the country and then crying foul when asked to back them up.

<br />
This is an incomplete statement. You care that many more Americans are concerned with this than are concerned with what?
<br />

<br />
Many people care about religion. People care about values. Some peoples religion imparts a value that homosexuality is immoral.
<br />

<br />
Im atheist and I am perfectly fine with others being homosexual so I largely disagree with these people. I argue against some of their positions and values with reasoned arguments in an attempt to assist them in seeing my point of view and considering it.
<br />

<br />
Dismissing these people out of hand as irrational bigots is...
<br />

<br />
wait for it...
<br />

<br />
Thats right: intolerant and polarizing!!!
<br />

<br />
If you want to be part of the solution you need to engage those who disagree with you and bring them to the table for compromise, recognizing that you are going to have to compromise your beliefs and values also in order to reach a mutually acceptable middle ground. Bear in mind that the best compromises result in both parties feeling as if they didnt get enough of what they wanted.
<br />

<br />
Further, you have no evidence supporting your assertion of widespread violated civil rights.
<br />

<br />
As it stands, you are part of the problem. I hope youll come to see that and gain some perspective.

What divisive hyperbole.
<br />

<br />
The fact is that this board does, in some ways, mimic that national landscape. The national landscape consists of the vast majority of people with different points of view coexisting in peace and harmony. The divided, polarized, nation only exists in a very vocal minority on both sides. The raving from the radical left that the Christian right gave Bush his job on a groundswell of anti-gay bigotry is refuted by the facts. The statistic used to support it, that around 22% of people voted on values, can be flipped to 78% not caring about values, eh?
<br />

<br />
Likewise, Bush gained more votes over the 2000 election in states without a gay marriage amendment than with so the gay-baiting electoral victory thing is pretty beat.
<br />

<br />

<br />
You are not being treated as a terrorist. Terrorists are shot or imprisoned. You are being engaged and ask to support your assertions. You are being treated as an American.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>
