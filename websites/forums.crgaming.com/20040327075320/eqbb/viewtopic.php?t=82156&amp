				<td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">First, I must state: this is NOT a fan fic.  It is not eq based, nor even related.  If this is a problem, it is no problem if you delete it.  I've noticed that few stories have been posted lately, which is what prompted me to post this.  It's kind of a boring story as of now, not much action, but that is due to the fact that I really wanna spend some time on this.  No write write write post, no.  I've actually reread my posts before posting them!  Well, without further aeduie(I know, I butchered the word)  heres 'The Sword of the King!'A girl, pretty, but in a rough, non-refined way, sat upon a wall of stone.  Her dress was simple, of a shade of brown that could only be described as dirt.  It was the same shade as her eyes and hair, and the soil beneath her fingernails.  Potato peels gathered at her feet as her nimble fingers shed the vegetable of its exterior.  Whitney&amp;#8217;s life had been good.  Plain, but good.  Her mother had provided for her.  Together they had survived.  The garden in the back grew enough vegetables to feed the two, and Gertie gave them milk each morning.  
<br />
	&amp;#8220;You finished with those Potatoes yet Whit?&amp;#8221;  Her mother, kind, but stern.  Marna had not been so gifted with parents and a home.  She had grown on the streets in Ruskan.  Her parents were unknown to her.  The clerics of Amor had cared for her until the age of seven.  By then she was deemed &amp;#8216;of age&amp;#8217; to leave and start her life.  She was seven.  Whitney held the belief that her mother had been a thief, a member of those of the hand, but her belief was based only by her mothers slender, quick fingers, and her ability with a short blade.  Her life had been rough until she stumbled upon a cottage in the woods, abandoned, while not completely run down.  
<br />
	&amp;#8220;Almost Mom, one more minute.&amp;#8221;  The sun was quickly setting.  As the cold months approached, the days became shorter and shorter.  Whitney hated the cold.  As she finished with the potatoes, peelings gathered to give to the cow, Gertie, she made her way into the cottage that was home.  While only two rooms, it was more than enough for the pair.  The main room was compromised of the stove, the table, the chest, and the two chairs they owned.  The other room was where they slept.  Her mother slept on the bed and Whitney on a straw mat on the floor.  This winter, she planned on making a bed for herself, but she had said similar things years past and yet there never seemed to be enough time.  The mat was fine enough for her.  Quickly she dumped the potatoes in a pot and the peelings in a bucket off to the side while telling her mom she&amp;#8217;d be back shortly with the water.  
<br />

<br />
A boy, perhaps sixteen years of age, with barely the beginnings of a beard gracing his weak chin tread softly through the halls of the keep.  Taenin, the fifth son and one of seven children of a minor Noban(Lowest level of important nobility) knew his place.  As the last male child, his role was of no importance.  Most likely to be married off to a woman of neither renown, beauty, nor intelligence.  No, with his luck, she would have the grace, figure, and whit of a cow, and the smell to boot, but today was no time for such ill thoughts.  No, for Illynea was visiting.  She was the gorgeous daughter of King Brenan&amp;#8217;s brother, Lyam.  Her long flowing hair was as the sun and her fair skin as unmarred as pristine porcelain.  While he had yet mustered the courage to mutter a word to her, he knew she must be intelligent.  No one of such beauty could lack a certain amount of smarts.  Today would be different though.  He would talk to her, and she would fall madly in love with him.  Of course.  
<br />
	Out of the blue a sharp pain stabbed him in the back of his head.  &amp;#8220;Day dreaming again Tae?  Bout Illynea no doubt?  She doesn&amp;#8217;t even know your name, fool!&amp;#8221;  Derick was Tae&amp;#8217;s older brother by three years, although sometimes Tae believed him to have the emotional maturity of a boy the age of two.  He was not fat, but he was big.  He was only five feet, seven inches, but he must be nearly a hundred and ninety pounds.  Derick had always been a physical child, and would stop at nothing to use his advantage over his far smaller brother. 
<br />
	&amp;#8220;And you believe yourself to be so wonderful Derick?  I haven&amp;#8217;t a doubt as to YOUR intentions towards the fair maiden, but I would say the chances that she knows your name are as poor as my own.&amp;#8221;  Although his words struck home, his brother&amp;#8217;s had struck his own too.  Illynea knew not his name, why would she?  Again, he felt pain as his brother hit him, this time in the side, before running off.  
<br />
	As he saw the sun, Tae hit himself in the head.  He was late.  He was to have been tutored by Tully at three past noon, and it must be at least half past three.  Quickly, he sprinted up the stone steps used only by Tully and the seven children to whom he taught.  Although he was forced to learn through Tully, he rather enjoyed his time with the portly mage.  Secretly, he held a desire to learn the arcane art.  He had told his father of his desires years ago, and had quickly been cuffed in the back of the head for such thoughts.  He had never brought it up again, yet the desire still lingered, if only as a dream that would never be fulfilled.  As his hand darted forth to open the door, it surprisingly opened for him.  Standing there was Tully, as mad as a badger being taken from its home.  &amp;#8220;Sit.&amp;#8221;  He was ashamed for being late, for he had no excuse whatsoever.  Quietly, he took his seat behind a great oak table upon which was laid out great maps and books on court decorum and literature hundreds of years old.  Suddenly, Tully&amp;#8217;s face changed into that of the doting father.  &amp;#8220;I can not afford to waste my time Tae.  You understand that.&amp;#8221;  In a more stern voice, he again spoke, &amp;#8220;Now, explain to me the court behavior of the Bashians.&amp;#8221;
<br />
	&amp;#8220;Yes, Master Tully.  The Bashians are a people to the north.  The land in which they reside is kingdom territory, but they do not consider them people of the kingdom.  They do not pay taxes, but to go to war with the people would be disastrous as the terrain is heavily forested and the soil is extremely rocky.  Their knowledge of the area would cause great casualties on our side, if not an assured win for the Bashians.  While we are not friendly with them, trade agreements have been established and rarely is there bloodshed between the two people.  The Bashians themselves are Barbaric people, some nomadic, others territorial.  Those who do make homes live in huts of animal skins and rarely wood.  Each clan follows a Tribal leader.  Once a year, in the dead of winter, the leaders of each clan meet to discuss matters of a higher importance.  This council is considered to be the highest power of the Bashians.&amp;#8221;
<br />
	&amp;#8220;Good, but you left out one part.  Some of them, are cannibals.&amp;#8221;
<br />

<br />
His arm was tired already.  Gin Pe blocked yet another blow.  The savage commander seemed not to be letting up.  Gin Pe had only one option, lest his arm fail and he be left open to attack.  Quickly, he stabbed weakly at his commander.  His attack was turned away with ease and the commander turned his own block into a savage attack as he rushed Gin.  Seeing the two hundred pound man charge at him, Gin Pe did the first thing that came to his mind, duck.  As he felt the commander&amp;#8217;s weight slam into his side, he pushed up upon his shield, flipping the man.  From behind him, Gin Pe heard a chuckle. 
<br />
	&amp;#8220;Good move young one.  Sometimes you need not look to your sword to fight, but to your shield!&amp;#8221;  Gin Pe was still shocked from his first training fight.  He had enlisted in the Red army and began his training two months ago to this day.  He was of normal height, five nine, and of slight build.  His skin was pale and his hair a brown so dark in the right light in may have been deemed black.  The commander was a stark contrast being of deeply tanned skin, light brown hair, six two, two hundred pounds.  His name, as far as concerned the trainees, was commander.  He was their mother, their father, their death, their life, or so he said.  
<br />

She ran barefoot through the woods.  She knew every tree, root, and animal that resided in these woods.  This was her home.  The sound of song birds filled her ears.  Four minutes had passed before she arrived at the cold stream.  There was a flash in the water.  Fish!  There were three.  Dinner might not be so plain today.  Looking around, she saw a branch.  She threw it in the water downstream of the fish, and as always, they turned to flee upstream.  The current, while not strong, did help to slow them down as her hands darted forward to grab the two larger fish.  She threw them behind her onto shore before she went after the third.  Her hand grabbed at empty water as her eyes followed the young one swimming hurriedly downstream. Two fish was good enough anyway&amp;#8230;..  She returned back to her pot which she dipped into the stream to fill.  
<br />
Tying the two fish to her belt with a cord, she hefted to heavy pot and hurried through the darkening woods home.  Marn would be ready with the greens and the potatoes needed the water to be cooked.  By the time Whitney had arrived home, the sun was halfway past the crest of the hills.  It was late.  She entered her home.  Two warm candles shed light upon the kitchen.  Her mother sat wearily upon one of the chairs, her eyes closed.  Whitney knew she did not sleep, but merely rested.  Marn was able to remain alert while resting.  It was a form of meditation she had told her daughter, taught to her by the priests as a child.  Whitney had always wished to learn the practice, but as she had no time to make herself a bed, she lacked also the time to learn the meditation.  Practically the only art her mother had passed on to her was that of the short blade.  While about the same length of a short sword, short blades able to be wielded as Sais, held blade across the wrist, or short swords, tip out stretched.  Whit suspected her mother&amp;#8217;s desire for her to learn how to defend herself stemmed from her mother&amp;#8217;s rape, and the creation of Whitney herself.  As she dwelled on such thoughts, she took the potatoes she had peeled earlier and put them in the pot.  Putting them, along with the greens in the pot, she heated the fire beneath the stove and then began the process of gutting the fish.  She uttered a prayer to Hestia, goddess of food among other things, as she minced a clove of garlic to go with the fish.
<br />

<br />
	The lesson had been boring.  For nearly two hours Tully had had Tae recite information he knew by heart about neighboring nations and their policies followed by a list of every major noble throughout the kingdom.  This information was useless to him.  He would never be required to know information of such things.  He was unimportant.  
<br />
	&amp;#8220;It is time for dinner, and I am sure you must be famished my young pupil.&amp;#8221;  Tully grinned as Tae hurried out of the dusty tower room.  Tully picked up on many things, among them being the affection of every boy in the castle toward Illynea, Taenin included among those boys.  As Tae raced down the stairs, he looked down at himself.  Clothes unrustled and in well enough order.  He nodded as he entered the dining hall.  Already his two sisters, Clair and Gwennie were seated, Clair next to two prominent boys and Gwennie sitting quietly alone.  Tonight was his father&amp;#8217;s birthday, and many of the neighboring nobles had come to celebrate the wonderful day.  The only reason Prince Lyam had come was due to the fact that he had been nearby and it would have been a grave insult not to have attended, but that fact was fine to both Tae and his father.  Tae took a seat next to Gwennie, who, at the age of thirteen had no interest in boys and lacked any girls her age of interest to play with.  
<br />
	Her face lighted up as she saw her brother.  Tae and Gwen were kindred spirits.  The two youngest, mocked by their elder siblings.  Gwen was very mature for her age as she had already caught Tae in his studies with Tully.  Of course, she had already caught every sibling.  Her aptitude for learning was exceptional, as was the great expanse of both her kindness and her spite.  Had she been a first born, Tae did not doubt that she would have risen to the position of Duchess in a matter of years.  &amp;#8220;How are you doing Tae, you look tired big brother.&amp;#8221;
<br />
	&amp;#8220;I am fine Gwennie, Tully just bores me with such tedious studies.&amp;#8221;  Other people were filing in by the minute, among them Tae&amp;#8217;s four brothers, Derick, Thomas, Philup, and Shael.  Father sat at the head of the table, with mother next to him and Prince Lyam and Illynea to his left.  As it appeared everyone had been seated, servants hurried out to place giant platters of roasted deer and wild rice upon the tables.  Other such delicacies were brought and Noban Marcus, Tae&amp;#8217;s father, stood to speak.
<br />
	&amp;#8220;Thank you all for coming to celebrate my fiftieth Birthday.  I am not one for speeches so, I say to you, enjoy the feast.&amp;#8221;  The aging man took his seat and raised his goblet before taking a long draught of the exquisite wine grown in his own grove.  Tae grabbed a serving fork and took for himself and Gwennie a large slab of beef and a portion of rice.  She politely thanked him as she uttered a prayer for both of them to Hestia.  
<br />
	&amp;#8220;Take me for a ride after dinner Tae, please?&amp;#8221;  His response was garbled by the slice of deer in his mouth, but Gwennie took his answer to be &amp;#8216;sure.&amp;#8217;  &amp;#8220;My appetite has fled me brother, I will meet you at the stables when you are ready.&amp;#8221;  He nodded in response.  What was wrong with her, she had seemed&amp;#8230;distant.  Tae shrugged. 
<br />

<br />
	The sun had long set now and dinner had been served.  Whitney had quickly stepped out to bathe in a nearby pool and had changed into her shift.  The good thing about living alone with your mother out in the wild is one need not care about decency.  &amp;#8220;This trout is delicious Whit.  Thank you for cooking tonight, I felt tired.  As I grow old, my bones grow sore.&amp;#8221;
<br />
	&amp;#8220;You are not old mother!  Your life is not half yet over!&amp;#8221;
<br />
	&amp;#8220;Oh but I am old compared to your youthfulness my daughter.  I can no longer move as I once did.  I am old.&amp;#8221;  She took another bite of her fish and stabbed a piece of potato with her knife.  Marn would never be called gorgeous by a man, but she was  handsome.  Had she stayed in the city, she may have attracted the attention of some prosperous business man.  Her hair was a honey brown and her skin was lightly tanned.  Her features were not fine, but her nose was perfectly strait and her eyes were flecked with gold.  In fact, she was quite a voluptuous woman.  She looked twenty years ago much like her daughter does now.
<br />
	Whitney took her and her mother&amp;#8217;s plates and the serving dishes to the water basin where she quickly cleaned them and dried them with a rag before putting them back in the cupboard.  
<br />
	&amp;#8220;Whitney, we&amp;#8217;re leaving here.&amp;#8221;  Her mother&amp;#8217;s attitude had changed in a matter of seconds, her face now a mask of sincerity.  &amp;#8220;I have spoken to a friend of mine, a blacksmith in the port town of Elenel.  His wife has recently died due to the pox.  He has room for us and is in need of an apprentice.  I said you would be that apprentice.&amp;#8221;
<br />
	&amp;#8220;But mother, this is our home!  Are you not happy here, with me?&amp;#8221;  Although her mother had never shown anything but love for her daughter, but Whit always feared that Marn resented her for stopping her from doing the things she wished to do.  
<br />
	&amp;#8220;Oh, I am happy my daughter, I am.  But I am afraid that you grow too comfortable here.  You must learn of the world around us.  Matteus is a good man, he will care for us.  He lived in the church of Amor with me when we were children.  We were friends for years after and I saw him again last we were in Kilel.  This will always be our home daughter, but when I am gone, I can not leave you here, alone, ignorant of the world.&amp;#8221;
<br />
	Whit smiled.  Truly she had always wished to see the world.  With a smirk she spoke, &amp;#8220;But what of this apprenticeship, are not blacksmiths only men?&amp;#8221;
<br />
	&amp;#8220;Generally, but Matteus has assured me you will do finely.&amp;#8221;
<br />

<br />
	While desserts of giant trestled cakes and fine pastries were being served, Taenin silently slipped out of the dining hall.  No one would miss him.  Quickly he hurried through the empty halls to out into the chill air of night.  Gwen would be at the stables by now, wondering where he was.  He grabbed a torch from a scone as he walked through the court yard to where the horses were kept.  From the stables, he heard voices.  One, Gwen&amp;#8217;s, and the other&amp;#8230;.unmistakably female.  Then there was laughing.  Gwennie laughed far less often than should and the fact that she was surprised Tae.  The air was moist, and the dew had soaked through his stockings.  He had taken off his uncomfortable shoes during the banquet and had idiotically left them there.  He coughed, betraying himself.  Slowly, he made his way into the barn.  The horses stared at him as he walked to where his sister and her friend sat.  &amp;#8220;Hey Gwennie, who is your friend.&amp;#8221;
<br />
	&amp;#8220;Kalya.  She is the daughter of the Duke of Elenel.&amp;#8221;  The girl who turned around to meet him was beautiful in an exotic way.  Her skin was deeply tanned and her hair was a rich dark brown.  With eyes that were a vibrant, deep green and a bright smile, she was more than pretty.
<br />
	It was she that first greeted him.  &amp;#8220;Hello, may I assume you are one of Gwen&amp;#8217;s brothers?  Taenin perhaps?&amp;#8221;  He nodded in response.  With an acknowledging smile, she said, &amp;#8220;Gwen has told me of you.&amp;#8221;
<br />
	He was shocked by her beauty.  It had taken him time to realize how captivating she really was.  While not as pretty as Illynea, she had a distant, but up close warmth to her that tied his tongue in an impossible knot.  After a time, he managed to utter a few words.  &amp;#8220;Good things I should hope.  Do you&amp;#8230;Would you, would you like to ride with us?&amp;#8221;
<br />
	&amp;#8220;It would be my pleasure.  I had originally intended to leave the dinner, hoping to steal away on a horse for an hour or two.&amp;#8221;
<br />
	&amp;#8220;Gwen, have any horses been saddled?&amp;#8221;
<br />
	&amp;#8220;Yes, two.  May I ride myself today brother?&amp;#8221;  Being only thirteen generally Gwen was not allowed to ride alone, but Tae often refuted such a rule as Gwen was an accomplished rider.
<br />
	&amp;#8220;Sure Gwennie.  I&amp;#8217;ll will ready Thunderhoof for you.&amp;#8221;  Thunderhoof was a giant of a horse with the temperament of a rabbit.  His father had bought him as a prized stud only to find out the big beast was a dud.  He had no fire whatsoever and was deemed the safest horse to ride on.  
<br />
	&amp;#8220;I would PERFER a horse with some umph brother, one who might not stop to smell the daisies.&amp;#8221;
<br />
	&amp;#8220;Thunderhoof or you ride with me.&amp;#8221;  Tae did not need wait for an answer.  He knew which she would chose as he began to strap the saddle onto the giant black beast.  He then turned and hoisted his sister up into the saddle as she was not tall enough to get on herself.  He opened to gate and spoke, &amp;#8220;I will meet you outside.  Lead Thunderhoof about, he has not ridden in a week.&amp;#8221;  She nodded from her perch as she led with the reigns her beast of a horse out of the stable.  Tae turned to Kalya.  &amp;#8220;Here, is Silverspot alright.&amp;#8221;
<br />
	&amp;#8220;She is fine.&amp;#8221;  Kalya needed no help herself as she swung up upon the mare.  With a quick kick in the flanks, she had left the barn with Tae fast on her heels.  The moon was bright that night, its silver luminosity shedding light upon the three.  
<br />
	Gwennie, taller than Tae and Kaly upon Thunderhoof suggested they go to cold spring, a small pool a ten minute ride away.  
<br />
	&amp;#8220;I am in need of a swim.  I have not had time to bathe since I arrived from Elenel and need to shed this layer of dirt from my skin.&amp;#8221;  
<br />
	&amp;#8220;Lets go.&amp;#8221;  Tae kicked his horse in the sides setting off at a gentle gate, one which old Thunderhoof could keep up with.  &amp;#8220;How is living in Elenel Kalya.  Such a large port town, you must see such interesting people from the empire, and the island federations.&amp;#8221;
<br />
	&amp;#8220;You would think, but I don&amp;#8217;t.  Rarely am I allowed out of the keep, and the few people I do see are all boorish royalty.  Occasionally, I do slip out into the town, but at the hours I can manage to do so, the city is dead.  I envy the freedom you are allowed out in the county.&amp;#8221;
<br />
	&amp;#8220;Me and Tae are free of nothing.  For the few hours we are allotted a day, there is nothing to do.  We have no city, only a poor town with a tavern for the local drunks.  I guess we are both as caged birds.&amp;#8221;
<br />
	Tae turned to his sister.  &amp;#8220;I would have guessed you would have figured that out long ago.  Tis our lot, our sacrifice for the ease of our lives.  Nobody is truly happy with their lot in life.  The adventurer wishes he was rich and could live in gluttony, the farmer or tradesmen wishes to see the world, or be royalty, thinking that the lives we have are perfect, and we wish to see the world, or do something with our lives.  We all wish to be something we aren&amp;#8217;t, and even if we get to be that something, we will wish for something more.  Tully has told me it is a great thing to find happiness in being what you are.&amp;#8221;
<br />
	&amp;#8220;You are wise Taenin.&amp;#8221;
<br />
	Tae blushed.  &amp;#8220;Thank you Kalya.  I love to read and ponder about such things.  What is your desire, the thing you think would make you happy Kalya?&amp;#8221;
<br />
	&amp;#8220;Oh, Tae, I don&amp;#8217;t really know.  It is not that I am unhappy, but I do seek adventure.  I am not even permitted to train with weapons as are the men of court.  I am there to be pretty.  It is the lot of the royal woman, but it is not my lot.&amp;#8221;
<br />
	Gwen looked at Kalya, up and down.  &amp;#8220;And what if one is not pretty, my dear?  What is to be of the ugly noble woman.&amp;#8221;
<br />
	&amp;#8220;She, she is a political pawn to be traded to create alliances with others.  We are pawns Gwen.&amp;#8221;
<br />
	Tae looked at the two women.  &amp;#8220;It appears we are here.  Now, who is up for a swim?&amp;#8221;  They dismounted and Tae led the tree horses to a tree and tied their reigns to the large trunk.  The two women, stripped down to their shifts, dove into the crystal clear water from an outcrop of rocks.  Tae sprinted after then and dove in behind, coming up thirty feet away.   
<br />
*
<br />
	A week had passed since his father&amp;#8217;s birthday and Tae mourned the loss of the guests who had livened up the keep.  Once again life returned to the drudgery that seemed so terrible.  Lessons with Tully, arms training with Master Thul, and then&amp;#8230;nothing.  The only bright spot in his life was Gwennie.  She was the only one who he could talk to, excluding Tully.  She sat next to him on the window sill, staring out at the birds who seemed so free.  Her brown hair was tied back in a ponytail with a few free strands gracing her face.  Her thin lips creased into a smile as she squeezed her brother to her side.  Her tiny, rounded nose crinkled as she sneezed.  Blue-green-gold eyes twinkling in the light of midmorning.  The stone keep was especially cold this week.  It appeared winter would be early this year.  A warm blanket was wrapped about the two.  Gwennie had the odd habit of always carrying one about when it got cold, and Taenin was glad to have its warmth at that moment.  Kalya&amp;#8217;s family had stayed one day after the party, and in that time Gwen and Tae had gotten to know her better.  She was an interesting lady.  At the age of sixteen, she already carried on diplomatic arrangements and had visited the Federation of the Isles.  And she thought her life was boorish!  Tae turned to his sister.  &amp;#8220;Shall we see about getting some breakfast Gwen?&amp;#8221;
<br />
	&amp;#8220;Sure.  I hope there are some of those
<br />
	He cut her off. &amp;#8220;Honey glazed sweet rolls that you love so much.&amp;#8221;
<br />
	&amp;#8220;Yep!&amp;#8221;  Neither had to say &amp;#8216;race yeah&amp;#8217;, they always raced, and Gwen always won.  Tae knew there were hidden passages throughout the keep, but he himself knew of none.  He suspected Gwen knew them all.  Often she had appeared in his room without walking through the door.  Whenever he questioned her on the matter, she would shrug and change the subject.  The fact that Gwen always managed to beat him never seemed to stop him from trying, and today was no different.  Without warning, he sprinted off, almost knocking down a page carrying a tray of food, most likely to Clair, or Mother.  His unclad feet fell upon cold stone as he sprinted through the halls.  Tapestries of Nobans of old adorned the walls, helping to keep a small amount of warmth in the keep.  As he took the last turn into the dining hall, there stood Gwen with a smile plastered upon her pretty face.  
<br />
	&amp;#8220;I win.  Now, lets go get some Honey rolls.&amp;#8221;  Tae sighed, how did he always manage to loose.  Together they entered the kitchen with the obviously famished Gwen leading the way.  Ponytail bobbing, she hurried past the breads and breakfast cakes to where she knew the sweet rolls to be.  Grabbing two with her tiny hands, she tossed one to Tae as she stuck the other sticky glob into her mouth.  In one swallow she gobbled the entire thing and licked her fingers before going back for another.  As she began to bite into her third, she remembered, she had a lesson with Tully this morning.  Bad memory seemed to run in the family.  As she ran out of the kitchen Tae shouted to her.
<br />
	&amp;#8220;Where you headed all of a sudden?&amp;#8221;  
<br />
	She shouted while running, &amp;#8220;Lesson, Tully.&amp;#8221;
<br />
	&amp;#8220;Wait up, I&amp;#8217;ll go with you.&amp;#8221;  Not that I have anything better to do he added to himself.  He truly loved his sister and enjoyed spending time together, but often he found himself with her merely due to a lack of other things to do.  He grabbed another roll before sprinting after her.  In the hall he managed to almost catch her.  She left the room and took a left.  As Tae turned the corner, she was nowhere to be seen.  Somehow, she always managed to do that, somehow&amp;#8230;
<br />
	&amp;#8220;Taenin, you father wishes to speak with you.&amp;#8221;  Quickly whirling to see whom addressed, Tae saw the worn leathers of Arms Master Thul.  
<br />
	&amp;#8220;Oh, thank you sir.  Do you happen to know what about.&amp;#8221;  Rarely did his father send for him. He is of no importance of course.
<br />
	&amp;#8220;No, I&amp;#8217;m sorry, but his tone did not indicate trouble Tae.&amp;#8221;  The old man smiled and chuckled a bit.  &amp;#8220;You&amp;#8217;re off the hook, for now.&amp;#8221;  
<br />
	As they parted, Thul walking to the dining hall, Tae to his father&amp;#8217;s chambers, Tae turned again to address his teacher.  &amp;#8220;Sir, would it be possible to train today?&amp;#8221;
<br />
	Master Thul whirled quickly.  Taenin, least of all his siblings, had never displayed any interest in sword play.  Flabbergasted, he said of course to his young master.  It would be a long day for both, Taenin was NOT good with a sword.  
<br />
	As he ran off, Tae shouted, &amp;#8220;Thank you master!&amp;#8221;  His father&amp;#8217;s chambers were not far.  His run settled down to a slow walk as he neared the room where his father labored over reports daily.  Brooding was not normally a habit of those in his family, but every so often Taenin found himself obsessing over every little this and that.  This sight of the two doors, the picture of the family crest embossed on the front, brought him back to the world.  Tentatively he pushed open the doors.  He and his father were not close.  After his eighth birthday, Marcus had begun to ignore Taenin.  The novelty of being the youngest male had worn off, and he was no longer cute.  What could his father have in store for him?&amp;#8221;  
<br />
	&amp;#8220;Taenin my son.  It is good to see you.&amp;#8221;  The room was decorated with wood from a vibrant red tree, most likely an exotic oak from the west.  Books filled the shelves that lined the walls many feet up in the domed room.  At his desk sat Noban Marcus.  Age had taken his toll on him and he was no longer the muscular youth he had once been considered.  He was not fat, but his muscle had not survived his age and his hair was more gray than chestnut brown.  His skin was not wrinkled, but tiny lines lined his eyes and the twinkle that had once so fiercely sparkled was now dull.  
<br />
	The boy approached his father&amp;#8217;s desk, littered with papers from other nobanities and such.  &amp;#8220;It is good to see you father.  I hope all things are well?&amp;#8221;
<br />
	&amp;#8220;As well as can be hoped.&amp;#8221;  There was a long pause before Noban Marcus said his next statement, and he seemed almost sad to be having to say it.  &amp;#8220;Taenin, it is high time that you leave these walls.  It has come to my attention that you have befriended Kalya, daughter of the Noban of Elenel.  I spoke with him before them left for home.  He agreed to allow you to work for him in his business pursuits.  You will learn.  You leave tomorrow.&amp;#8221;
<br />
	The shock hit him like a sack of dirt to the stomach.  He should have been prepared for this.  His brothers had been sent away at earlier ages to go learn.  It was common for fathers of like political standing to &amp;#8216;trade&amp;#8217; children in an attempt to help teach them in less emotionally comfortable environments.  Although he would return after his stay, he would not remain at home for long and his relationship with his father would never be the same.  Soon after the return he would be married.  In less than a year, he would be seventeen.  The standard marrying age was between eighteen and twenty.  &amp;#8220;I will miss you father.&amp;#8221;  
<br />
	I know.  Now, begone.  Ready yourself for the trip and say your good byes.  I will see you tomorrow out at the front gates with a carriage at eight.&amp;#8221;  As Taenin began to leave the room, he heard his father whisper to himself, &amp;#8216;good bye.&amp;#8217;  
<br />
	Taenin had still not fully absorbed the entirety of his situation.    Minutes later, he found himself folding clothes, placing them neatly in his bags, but his mind was not on the task before him.  No, for in his mind he saw his sister, his mother, his father, Thul, Tully, and oddly enough, Kalya.  
<br />
* * *
<br />
	They had left four days ago.  Carrying only what few things they could, Whitney and Marna left behind them the lives they had led for nineteen years, yet neither shed any tears.  To each, they left behind only a plot of land.  What mattered to Whit was her mother, and vice versa.  A day ago they had sold Gertie to a poor farmer who had promised not to kill her for meat.  She was but an animal, but over the years the two women had grown attached to the old cow.  They had encountered few travelers over the past few days on account of the paths they used were rarely traversed.  Living in the woods outside of Kilel, they were able to take all of the small roads off of the main one heading to Elenel.  The weather had been relatively warm over the last three days considering the almost wintry weather they had experienced the week before.  Squirrels were taking the calm weather as a time to gather the last much-needed nuts.  Birds flew above, migrating to more comfortable areas.  &amp;#8220;Mother, do you know how far we are, from Elenel?&amp;#8221;
<br />
	&amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;d guess about five, six days away at the pace we have set.&amp;#8221;  As the current path they were on converged with the main road, both checking each way for a farmer&amp;#8217;s cart that they might happen to bum a ride on.  Three days past another had let them ride on his vegetable cart until their paths divided.  Unfortunately, the roads were deserted of all life as far as the eye could see excluding a carriage, most likely for a prosperous person of sorts who would look down at people such as Marn and Whit.  Its approach was slow, but constant.  To avoid the horses, Whitney walked over to the other side of the road pulling her mother with her.  Half a minute later, the gilted carriage rolled past, and in the corner of the window, her eyes locked with those of the rich passenger.  He starred at her in such an odd way, as if she was an oddity to be observed under a microscope.  Had he never seen a girl before?  Or was it the fact that she wasn&amp;#8217;t gorgeous and bedecked in gowns of gold and pearls?  But, there was another thing in that gaze.  Almost as if he was telling her he knew her, but she had no clue as to who he was.  Either way, he was a fool.  The mud splattering from the wheels of the carriage sprayed the hem of her dress, adding to the days of filth already coated on the ragity garment.   
<br />

<br />
	Parting with his family had been harder than he had imagined.  His father had shown more emotion than Tae had ever seen from the aging man, and had gone so far as to embrace his son in a warm hug.  His mother and Clair each hugged him and cried, as was deemed proper of the two.  Their tears were mere ceremony to him though.  They didn&amp;#8217;t know him, and mourned nothing.  Derick could be found, still in bed, not caring at all as to what happened to his brother.  Arms Master Thul and Tully had shown, patting him on the back, saying they wished to see him soon.  Truly the only odd thing about the morning was that Gwen had not shown.  Her absence on the unusual calm day was a wonder.  Tae concluded that she was angry at him, for he was leaving her, but that did not ease the sadness he felt for not being able to see her before he left.  The journey had been quick with few interruptions.  The three days on the road had been lonely, and boring, but the fact that he would soon see the great seaport of Elenel kept his spirits high.  The only odd thing about the ride had been that woman, walking with another, her elder sister, or&amp;#8230;maybe her mother.  The girl, the younger one, when his eyes locked with hers, he knew he had seen her before.  There was a great sense of recognition, but he hadn&amp;#8217;t the faintest idea as to who she was.  Well, what did that matter.  All thoughts were banished from Tae&amp;#8217;s mind as the great town that was Elenel came into view.  The teamster quickly explained the reason for entrance to the guards, and, having been to Elenel before, hurried to the home of Kalya.  The city itself was beautiful.  The walls and buildings were carved of a great milky white stone and the streets were cobbled with stones with flecks of a stone that glittered under the suns rays, but it was not the city that held Tae&amp;#8217;s attention.  The people, the entire atmosphere was a whole different world to the boy who had never left his small country home.  There were traders from the far west, east, and the island federations.  Odd clothing with such bright colors and designs.  Fruits and smells he had never seen nor smelled before.  He was as a child for the first time in a candy store.  Quickly the crowds thinned as they left the bazaar rolled into the more prosperous part of town.  Mere minutes later, that seemed to Tae as small moments in time, the teamster ordered the horses to stop as they pulled up before a great building.    Behind gates of Marble and steel, a castle of immense proportions lay.  Unlike the dour stone feel of home, this place was full of life with blooming red flowers climbing great wooden trestles and huge hedges formed in all forms of shapes.  Two sets of stairs surrounding a pool of crystalline water led up to large double doors of wood embossed with silver that must have stood fourteen feet high.  As the awe struck boy of sixteen took in everything he had seen in the last few minutes, a reception of at least fifteen people burst forth, among whom at least twelve were servants dressed in the impeccable livery of the Elenel House.  Foremost among the throng was Kalya, bedecked in the finery due a queen.   
<br />
	&amp;#8220;Greetings Taenin.  I hope your journey went well, I am pleased to see you.&amp;#8221;  Large Diamonds hung from her ears and her dress was almost as beautiful as she herself.  While not overly done, it definitely did not lack a regality to it, but it did manage to retain a form making Taenin think about what was under those folds of periwinkle fabric.  Her tanned skin was unmarred by anything and her emerald eyes twinkled like the thousands of stars in the midnight sky.  
<br />
	&amp;#8220;Hello Kalya.  The pleasure is mine.&amp;#8221;  
<br />
	&amp;#8220;Our servants will take your bags, I will show you to your room now.  Father wishes to see you to discuss your position after you have settled in, but do not worry about such things as of now.&amp;#8221;  She placed her hand over his, coaxing him to release the bag in his hands to the care of a servant while pulling him along through the great doors.  The room inside was no less splendid than the outside.  Great chandeliers, paintings fantastically done, carpets of crimson, and everything encrusted with gold left him star struck by the near blinding glitter of it all.  Like a new born puppy Tae followed her up spiraling stair cases through hallways into what he took to be the guest wing.  As they reached a door painted an absurd color of purple, Kalya turned the knob and pushed open the door while motioning for Tae to enter.  His room was gigantic with a bed three times the size of his last.  Tens upon tens of pillows lay upon the thing.  A writing desk was placed near the window with more than sufficient light and a velvet chair.  
<br />
	&amp;#8220;Tell me Kalya, is everything here done so&amp;#8230;.splendidly?&amp;#8221;  His amaze startled her.  This was what she was used to.  As he was accustomed to cold, unfurnished halls of stone, she only knew this velvety, golden luxurious&amp;#8230;.thing.  
<br />
	She giggled.  &amp;#8220;You do not find it stifling?  I rather preferred the stark, natural beauty of your home.&amp;#8221;
<br />
	Suprisingly, Taenin found himself agreeing with her.  &amp;#8220;Yes, you are right.  The frivolity could kill a king, but it is startling.&amp;#8221;  Although it was only four o&amp;#8217;clock, Taenin found himself yawning.  His journey had been long and he was in desperate need for actual sleep.  
<br />
	&amp;#8220;Oh!, I&amp;#8217;m sorry.  You must be tired from your journey.  You will need rest.  I will tell father you sleep.&amp;#8221;  She hurried out of the room before he had time to object.  As he fell into the soft heap of down quilts on his bed, he shrugged.  He was tired.
<br />
* * *
<br />
	Mud still crusted her shift, and the dour weather was making Whitney feel quite sour.  Her mother hadn&amp;#8217;t said a word in the last two hours and the song birds refused to grace her with their music.  The sun was setting and it was hard to make out the large rocks that were so easily tripped over.  She almost hoped she and her mother would get attacked so that she could use her short blades, almost.  &amp;#8220;Mother, shall we camp soon?  We have but a few minutes of light left in the day.&amp;#8221;  Whitney shivered as a chill wind picked up.  The cold pierced the thin cloth of her dress, and further past her skin into her very core.
<br />
	Sighing, the weary Marna had to agree with her daughter.  &amp;#8220;Yes, it is time.  I had hoped to get to Elenel by tomorrow night, but, we can&amp;#8217;t.&amp;#8221;  She took a sharp ninety degree turn as they walked into the dense woods to make camp.  Three minutes, they had walked three minutes from the path each night before making a fire and unrolling their blankets.  To Whitney, the three minutes seemed to be three hours.  The only sound echoing throughout the dark wood was that of her own boot crunching the dried branches beneath her feet.  She watched her mother in the dying light.  Standing upright, honey brown hair cascading down her back, she was beautiful, but almost cold over the last few days.  She stopped.  As Marn bent down to unpack the pots and food stores, Whitney turned to gather firewood.  The branches she collected in her arms were brittle due to the lack of rain of the last few days, perfect for a fire.  Two minutes had passed before she finished gathering the wood and returned to her mother who had removed the pot, potatoes, and sprouts.  Flint and stones were easily accessed from the sole pocket in her garment, and in but a moment, Whitney had coaxed a flame from her pile of dead foliage and twigs.  Both women sat with bowls of the sparse stew minutes later, exchanging little conversation.  While her mother continued to eat, Whitney kicked away the dead branches and rotten wood that littered the area and unfurled both her and her mother&amp;#8217;s blankets.  They slept early in the night so as to awake early to get in the most distance while they could the following day.  She left the task of cleaning up to her mother as Whitney left sleep quickly encompass her being.  
<br />
	Whether it had been minutes, or hours between then and when Marn shook Whit awake, she knew not.  The sky was dark, like fresh pitch.  She was groggy, but the words her mother uttered in her ear helped her awaken.  Silently, and discreetly, her mother spoke the words &amp;#8216;we are not alone.&amp;#8217;  Enstinctly, she grabbed her short blades with which she slept with each night.  The familiar feel of the metal helped to ease her nerves, if only a little.  She rolled her head to her side, looking at her mother.  Her eyes were closed, but she was not sleeping.  Whit stopped as her mother&amp;#8217;s lips moved to form the words, quiet, be still.  Lying her head back down upon her makeshift pillow, Whitney made the best attempt she could at trying to look asleep.  For her own sake, she hoped she looked the part.  As she strained to hear, she understood her mother&amp;#8217;s suspicions.  There were no night noises, no owls, nothing, except for the faint, but echoing sound of feet cracking twigs.  In a minutes time, the sounds had grown louder, closer.  Sweat dripped down her face, leaving behind trails of glistening cold.  Whitney&amp;#8217;s knuckles turned white as her grip on her blades grew tighter, but she refused to ease her hold.  She would not die, nor would she disappoint her mother.  And then there was running.  They thought to ambush she and her mother, quickly and easily.  They were two women, sleeping.  It would be easy, two ordinary women, but Marna and Whitney were not normal women.  
<br />
	There were three of them who emerged from the brush, rushing the camp.  Mangy hair topped their heads and dirt was encrusted everywhere on their beings.  Their clothes were scraps of cloth thrown together to somehow form a mass of warmth.  At one time, the rags may have maintained a color, but they were all blended together and covered with a thick layer of brown grime.  They were highway men, and this time, their target was Whitney and Marn.  As one came within three feet of Marn, she jumped to her feet. Catching him off guard, she quickly struck the man in the face with the butt of her sword.  The blow bloodied his face and sent him to the ground.  The fight was now even, two on two.  Whitney and Marn moved to each other&amp;#8217;s sides as the pair of men closed in on them.  One had a sword, more rust than steel, and the other a pair of wicked daggers almost a foot long each.  The man with the daggers lunged for Whit, and she assumed her mother would take care of the other.  Fear clutched her heart as this man who was easily half a foot taller than her and a good deal heavier came closer, ever closer.  His blade flashed, and Whit felt hot blood flow down her leg as her side burst open in pain.  White stars flashed before her.  She felt as if she would soon die.  Nevertheless, she raised her blades.  Her blades moved as she clumsily blocked yet another attack.  In anger, the man grunted as he rained blows down upon her and she attempted to block them all.  Luckily, those that she missed also missed her.  He was obviously surprised to see that she was still alive, and that thought irked him.  She winced as the pain in her side increased and her vision grew hazy.  Training hidden in memory kicked in as the girl savagely thrust her blade.  With his two daggers, the man blocked the first blow, but completely missed the second aimed at his head.  With the flat of her blade, Whit rendered the man unconscious.  She smiled over her victory.  To her right she saw her mother standing over the bodies of the other two, one bleeding profusely from a slash to the temple, the other with a gaping hole in his stomach and blood dripping from three other slits along his body.  His death shocked the young girl.  She had never seen a dead person before, and the fading life horrified her.  Hell, she had rarely seen men before!  She had only been to town a handful of times in her life.  If this was what her mother wanted her to see in the world, she didn&amp;#8217;t want to see the world!  Her stomach was in a knot as the faint girl fell over in a mixture of horror and exhaustion.

	Sitting on his cot, Gin Pe thought over what he had learned today.  War was imminent.  It was unsure as to when his unit would be deployed, but others had already been sent &amp;#8216;cross sea.  The commanders seemed both excited, and fearful as their deaths were no longer &amp;#8216;something of a time to come far from now.&amp;#8217;  He had learned much in his month and a half of training, but not yet a thousandth of what he would need to know.  His sword skills were mediocre at best and he proved to be exceptionally inept at blocking and following orders.  The mages were preparing for the up coming battles.  Lately, there had a great increase in the loud noises and bright flashes of fire and other such sorcery in the distance where the troops had assumed the mages to be being trained.  War mages were a commodity the Empire took great attempts to have.  If ever there was war, it would be the mages whom would decide the outcome.  So said the Emperor, so must it be.  For this war of which he knew not about, he must be prepared.  So said the Emperor, so must it be.  If anything, that is what Gin Pe knew and lived by.  The Emperor knows all, and is wise among all, even the gods among whom are the past Emperors.  Thoughts of his own death flashed in Gin Pe&amp;#8217;s mind.  He did not look forward to meeting Tolome, God of Death.  The Emperor says I will go to war, but that doesn&amp;#8217;t mean I have to like it&amp;#8230;

	The taste of the sweet roll still lingered in her mouth as Whitney licked her lips, trying to extract every molecule of the sweet substance.  Never before had she had such a delicacy!  They had arrived in the city an hour ago, and Whitney had nearly fainted at the size of the thing!  She had never seen so many people much less buildings expanding more than ten feet high.  The experience really helped her understand what her mother meant when she said Whit was ignorant of the world.  And the capital in the east, Shielam, was five times the size with a castle equal in mass to this entire city!  Blindlessly following her mother, Whit managed to worm her way through the masses of people, all so unique.  New smells, people, things, even colors exploded in her mind.  With eyes as wide as a doe, she hurried to where her mother pushed through, lest she get lost among the crowd.  She felt a hand press tightly to her side, distinguished amongst the prodding of the others in her immediate proximity.  Glancing down, she saw the small, agile fingers of a youth, holding the strings to her purse.  Her eyes connected with those of a dirty boy, maybe eight years of age, wearing at least six layers of clothing for but a second before he darted off with her purse, empty, as she had spent her last copper on the sweet roll.  She grabbed her mother&amp;#8217;s hand and gave it a squeeze.  Marn turned to see what was amiss.  &amp;#8220;Some urchins got off with my purse.&amp;#8221;  
<br />
	Almost annoyed, she replied with her brow furrowed.  &amp;#8220;Why didn&amp;#8217;t you stop him.&amp;#8221;  Before Whit could respond, a man knocked Marn off her balance, knocking her near off balance.  As a reaction, Whit punched the man right in the face.  When his hands moved away from his face, she saw blood trickling gently down from his nose.  She was shocked.  She had never hit a person before.  Not knowing what to do, she grabbed her mother&amp;#8217;s hand and ran.  They ran for minutes until finally they stopped, panting from the exertion.  
<br />
	Between gasps, her mother managed a few words.  &amp;#8220;Why&amp;#8217;d you do that hun?  You can&amp;#8217;t just punch people here.&amp;#8221;
<br />
	&amp;#8220;I know, I don&amp;#8217;t know what came over me.  I saw him push you, so, I punched him.&amp;#8221;
<br />
	&amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s alright.  Well, luckily you led us the right way.  Matteus&amp;#8217; forge is but a block away, I think.  Its been awhile since I&amp;#8217;ve been to Elenel.&amp;#8221;  The area in which they had fled was less busy than the market adjacent street they had recently been in, but it was still busy.  Together they walked through the sun lit, cold streets.  They found the forge by accident, stopping by the warmth to heat their numb hands.  Inside, Matteus spotted Marna.  
<br />
	&amp;#8220;Marny!  Its been too long!&amp;#8221;  Mother and Daughter turned to regard the man behind the window.  Inside the building was a hearty man whose voice was loud and the smile on his face seemed wider than possible.  He hurried to the door, ushering the pair inside.  His dirty blond hair was of average length.  He was roughly six feet tall and a bear of a man.  His body was a barrel with thickly muscled limbs.  He embraced Marna in a bear hug, as he was a bear of a man and turned to regard the girl who would soon be his apprentice.  &amp;#8220;You must be Whitney!  You&amp;#8217;re the spitting image of your mother.  So beautiful.&amp;#8221;  He smiled, and Whitney saw her mother do the same.  
<br />
	&amp;#8220;Oh, Matt, thank you.&amp;#8221;  Marna seemed truly happy to see her old friend as she smiled as Whitney had not seen her do for quite some time now.  Life in the wood had been good, but rarely did an occasion for celebration arise.  Whitney had always assumed life everywhere was the same, until she saw the city but a mere hour ago.  Now her opinion on everything was shaky.  
<br />
	&amp;#8220;Oh, come in come in, get out of that cold.  I live upstairs, there are two rooms for the both of you.  I&amp;#8217;ve been expecting your for quite some time.  Here, follow me, I will show you your quarters.&amp;#8221;  He turned and the pair followed him up a steep set of stairs. On the bottom floor was the forge.  Whit had gotten a quick glance of the hot coals, tools which she hadn&amp;#8217;t the faintest of ideas on how to use, and the anvil upon which lay a hammer and a pair of horse shoes.  The stairs led up to a dead end hall way with two sets of doors on both sides of the corridor.  &amp;#8220;On the right are your rooms, I&amp;#8217;m at the end on the left.&amp;#8221;  Again, he smiled.  Already Whitney knew she liked this man whose smile made her feel happy and safe.  &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;ll leave you two to get settled, I have work to do.  If you&amp;#8217;d like when your done Whitney, you may come down and I can begin instructing you.&amp;#8221;
<br />
	Timidly, she replied.  &amp;#8220;Alright.&amp;#8221;  
<br />

	The last few days had been wonderful.  Kalya&amp;#8217;s father had briefed him quickly on what his duties would be, but he would not be expected to work for the next week or two while he was &amp;#8216;getting settled.&amp;#8217;  Although he had provided him with a room, food, and everything to make him comfortable, there was something about the slick, fat man that just didn&amp;#8217;t settle well with Taenin.  Whatever irked him about the father was clearly not present in the daughter.  He and Kalya had been growing ever closer and he felt his feelings of friendship were blossoming into something else.  Yesterday, they had gone for a day long ride out in the country through a tunnel under the city wall behind the castle.  What seemed to be only an hour or two had turned out to be half a day.  He awoke with a smile on his face with his hair sticking this way and that.  Sun light streamed into the chilled room through his one large window.  Lethargically, Tae crawled out from under the mountain of blankets the covered his enormous, purple and gold gilt bed.  Yawning like a lazy, fat cat basking in the warming sunlight, Taenin found himself for the first time in his life, completely content.  He made his way into his bathroom, his own private bathroom, with hot running water!  Emerald glass tiles imported from the Island Federations lined the floors and an extravagant mirror hung upon the wall.  Below was a sink, water ready, with soap that wouldn&amp;#8217;t tear your skin off.  Tae had been surprised after his first bathing when his skin wasn&amp;#8217;t red and sore from the soap as the harsh bars from home often caused such symptoms. Home had never had running water much less water that wasn&amp;#8217;t nearly freezing.  With the turn of a knob, hot steaming water rushed down into a copper tub.  In less than a minute, Tae was soaking away his aches and pains and every thought that had ran through his head.  He scrubbed himself down from the hair to the toes, washing away the dirt from the previous day.  Kalya found it odd he wished to bathe alone.  Kalya, her family, and many of the servants chose to bathe together in a giant pool, while servants hurried around to clean those bathing with soft towels and soap.  Taenin secretly was appalled by such indiscretion of the human body.  His thoughts were interrupted.  Again!  A noise.  Ever since he had arrived, Taenin had heard noises in his room, as if a giant mouse was sifting through his things.  Silently, he slipped out of the tub and donned one of the soft robes left there for such a purpose.  He would catch this rodent!  As the water dripped off his head, he heard the thing scurry again.  Breaking into a run, he left his bathroom into his bedroom.  He saw the tail of a skirt trailing out the door into the hall.  As he ran to the door, it slipped out.  Looking both ways, he saw no trace of anyone.  His current clothing helped persuade him pursuit was not in his best interest at the moment as the silk robe was very revealing.  Well, at least now he knew his infestation problem was human.  Thick carpets soaked up water, dripping off Taenin&amp;#8217;s now cold body.  With a towel hanging from a rack in his bathroom, he dried himself off before slipping into his clothes.  A pair of golden brown trousers and a cream coloured shirt soon covered skin recently bare.  Hmm, he was to dine with Kalya this morning, as he was every morning.  The only thing informal at Elenel was eating.  People were expected to come and go, grabbing what they needed from platters placed out in the dining hall.  Rarely was it used for many to eat together at a table.  Shrugging, he thought back as to how he and Gwennie used to come and go, taking what they wanted.  Not very different.  Oh Gwennie, he missed her more than he thought possible.  Her smile, her way of making him happy, he missed his little sister.  Maybe he would ask if she would be able to come visit he.  As he left his room, making the short trek to the dining hall, he became more resolved on the idea.  The idea of seeing his sister, even having missed her for only a handful of days, warmed his heart.  A sweet smell filled his nose as he neared the hall.  The food here was always so good.  The dining hall itself was most likely one of the grandest room of all, with ceilings climbing fifty feet up, and silver platters everywhere.  Vibrantly colored tapestries lined the walls depicting tales of old.  At the end of one of the tables sat Kalya, dressed in far less glittering clothes than normal.  In fact, she looked practically a peasant with a plain cotton skirt and faded saffron blouse.  She smiled as he slid into the seat across from her.
<br />
	&amp;#8220;Good morning Kalya.&amp;#8221;  Taking a pot of tea, Taenin poured himself a cup.  &amp;#8220;Tea?&amp;#8221;
<br />
	&amp;#8220;Please.&amp;#8221;  Delicately, she lifted the porcelain cup to her lips, smelling the steam before taking a long sip.  &amp;#8220;We&amp;#8217;re going into the city today.&amp;#8221;
<br />
	After a moment, Tae replied.  &amp;#8220;But I thought you were not permitted access into the city.&amp;#8221;
<br />
	Impishly, she responded.  &amp;#8220;&amp;#8216;I&amp;#8217; am not, bet Desra the merchant&amp;#8217;s daughter is.&amp;#8221;  With that, she motioned to her garb with her hands, which he now noticed were covered with a thin layer of dirt, hiding her fine hands and well manicured nails.  &amp;#8220;After breakfast, you must change.  You will find clothes provided for you laid out upon your bed.&amp;#8221;
<br />
	&amp;#8220;Does your father permit of this?&amp;#8221;  Taenin had no desire to infuriate his host by going out into the dangerous sister with his daughter.
<br />
	&amp;#8220;No, but that makes it that much more fun!&amp;#8221;  As she noticed his face, frowning upon such actions she pouted in the fake way in which girls can make a man do anything they wished.  &amp;#8220;Afraid of alittle trouble eh? I&amp;#8217;ve done this numerous times, and not once has father caught me.&amp;#8221;  A little lie never hurt anyone&amp;#8230;..Well, except for Taenin.
<br />
	With a sigh, he reluctantly agreed to her plan, knowing full well that the chances they would be caught were high.  Grabbing a muffin, he told her he&amp;#8217;d be down in a minute and hurried back to his room.  Maybe he should grab a coat, it was getting cold&amp;#8230;
<br />
* * *
<br />
	The city was a whole different world from the safety of the walls of the castle.  Everything was so crowded, so busy.  Driving in a carriage through Elenel had not given the town justice.  Down on ones feet, the experience is far different.  People pushed, the roads were covered in mud and horse dung, and the stench of unbathed people permeated the air, but the smile on Kalya&amp;#8217;s face told him the things he would see would out weigh the stench of horse dung.  At least, he hoped as much.  Blindly he followed her, thinking she knew exactly where she was and where she was going.  In truth, she hadn&amp;#8217;t the faintest idea to either the destination, or the location.  The sound of haggling, and the sight of rich hangings and draperies told her they were in the bazaar, and in one of the richer quarters.  The glint of gold, true gold, caught Kalya&amp;#8217;s eye.  As all girls liked jewelry, Kalya was no exception.  Quickly, she hurried to the stall without bothering to see if Taenin followed.  Two other possible customers stood, examining the merchandise.  One, sex indiscernible, clad in the swaddling wraps of red and yellow of the west, the other a woman with no special features whatsoever.  The merchant himself wore furs to help ward off the cold and was sweating profusely.  With pudgy fingers, he held up a cheap ring, three giant, obviously fake, amethyst stones set in the band.  It&amp;#8217;s price was equal to that of the station she was portraying.  She had meant to look the part of the wife, or elder daughter of a prosperous merchant.  With such an outfit, she would be treated with respect by merchants, but would give thieves nothing to be desired.  With what she took to be a sneer, he spoke in a voice more akin to that a frog than a person.
<br />
	&amp;#8220;Might this look nice upon your delicate digit?&amp;#8221;  She gave him her hand as he motioned for her to do so.  She feigned interest as he slid the thing on.  If her fingers were normally delicate, they seemed ever more so with the band on that wouldn&amp;#8217;t have fit snugly on her big toe.  With a shake of the head, she politely refused and handed him back the ring.  As he went to bring forth another item, she muttered, &amp;#8216;just browsing.&amp;#8217;  Taenin arrived, cheeks red with cold, and breathing quickly from trying rather unsuccessfully to maneuver through the crowds.  
<br />
	&amp;#8220;So, is this what we came to see?  Petty jewelry?&amp;#8221;  The salesman gave him a dirty look, but refrained from responding to the insult.  She gave him a sharp jab in the side.  Of course, if he referred to the baubles as inferior, the merchant would raise the price, if only in spite.  Tae found himself disappointed.  He had expected too much of the city to be awed by anything short of dragons and fire eating Islanders.  
<br />
	 &amp;#8220;Of course not.  We&amp;#8217;re seeing a show today.&amp;#8221;  With a last look, she surveyed the merchandise before leading him away.  So terrible, there had not been a single piece of respectable finery there.  Kalya had frequented that shack often in the past under numerous guises, and each time the quality grew worse and worse.  She would soon need to find new stores.  
<br />
	Taenin was positively stumped.  He had never seen a &amp;#8216;show&amp;#8217; before and hadn&amp;#8217;t the faintest idea as to what Kalya was referring to.  
<br />
	Kalya, ever the detective, noticed Taenin&amp;#8217;s questioning gaze, and explained to him what a &amp;#8216;show&amp;#8217; is.  &amp;#8220;We&amp;#8217;re seeing a reenactment of the battle for Stone Keep, now Skull Keep named for all the skulls placed on pikes around the structure.  It details the horrific things the Empire did to our people, and how they ruthlessly took our land.&amp;#8221;
<br />
	&amp;#8220;Oh, how&amp;#8230;pleasant?&amp;#8221;  She laughed at his attempt at humor.  With her arm holding him tight to her side, they ambled off in a direction she gently led them both.  She had seen this performance before, but never outside her father&amp;#8217;s court.  Rarely did she ever see anything outside of court.  As they approached the theater, a tall four story building painted in gaudy shades of saffron and pink with great ionic pillars, she pulled out her purse to pay the shivering ticket salesman wearing nothing but thin silk more colorful than the theater standing outside. 
<br />

<br />
	Sweat poured down her burning forehead.  The heat from the forge aggravated muscles already in pain and left her feeling hot and dirty.  Matteus drilled into her the instructions she would need to mold the steel.  Over the past few days, he had taught Whitney the skills she would need if she were to succeed as a smith.  Sparks jumped again as her hammer struck the lump of metal growing roughly into the form of a horseshoe.  Her muscles screamed at her to give up and the knife wound in her side throbbed, but she dare not give up lest she risk receiving one of Matteus&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8216;disappointed&amp;#8217; stares.  She had grown to like him quickly with his big bear hugs and toothy grins.  The biggest thing though, was not his amiability, but the fact that he made Marna happy.  The city was Marn&amp;#8217;s environment and Matteus was one of her friends.  It was good to see her mother smile, it was good to want to smile.  Muscles she never knew existed hurt, she had kinks everywhere, but she felt good.  Every day she learned something new, both in the forge and out.  The life in the woods had been nice, and comfortable, but now Whitney realized, boring.  Better to be in pain in the city than grow lazy in the woods.  Again, she struck and the metal grew ever closer.  Yes, her muscles were weaker than those of a man, and that left her hindered, but Matteus taught her strength was not the only thing needed to be a smith.  With guidance, he showed her every strike could be used to greater effect which led to less of a need for more effort and energy.  After five minutes time, the shoe was done, and although it was not nearly as well crafted as those made by Matteus, it was useable.  Two days ago, the things she was producing were not suited to be paperweights.  With a slap the back, Matteus uttered one of those bellowing laughs.  
<br />
	&amp;#8220;Your getting better Whity.  Six or seven more years, and you might have a forge of your own.&amp;#8221;  The compliment was more than welcome, and generally it took people over ten years to get a forge of their own, not inc</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>
