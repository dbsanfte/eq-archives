So after waiting and waiting...and waiting some more....you are still going to have to wait   <IMG SRC="tongue.gif" border="0">. But because I am a nice guy(stop laughing!!) I am going to give a sneak peek to tide you over, the first 5 pages of SotV!!!! So sit back, crank up Napster(or some unnerfed spinoff) and enjoy!!! <P>3 notes, before you read. One, this is not the finished draft, so some things may change. Two the second scene is somewhat more grisly then usual. 3 for those wondering when I will hurry up and finish this and CR: The Movie Episode 2. I shall repeat ID Software's famous saying "When it's done." So without further chatting...<P>-------------------<BR>The Shadow Falls: Sign of the Void<BR>-------------------<P>	For almost 500 years , I have watched Norrath changed, blossom and decay. Nations rise and fall...teachings are learned and forgotten. Unfortunately the latter happened to what my beloved tried to show to the world. The truth behind all things fell upon deaf ears...the 'gods' sway has gone undiminshed...but like all things.They changed. Through are offspring, the truth is starting to be spread once again. Maybe this generation can finally convince Norrath...or maybe it will fall tot eh wayside once again..maybe...regardless of what happens, the winds of change are blowing was once again and Norrath will never be the same.<BR>--------------------<P>	Jesyca hated the underground caverns, they stunk like the pits of hell and were as dark as pitch.<P>|Why don't they ever clean these damn caverns?|<P>I have no idea Mika. You would think they would a city. a capital city no less as rich as Palsa could pay some one to clean it.<P>|Beauracrats..|<P>No kidding<P>|Jes..slow down a bit, i don't like this he has to be around here somewhere.|<P>Can't you sense his familiar?<P>|No..That scares me...I should be able to sense familiars|<P>I hate to admit it, but this is scaring me too..I almost wish that I had waited a bit..|<P>|Big bad Jes? scared? I'm shocked. Don't worry, You will do just fine, your more then ready to become th- DUCK!!!!|<P>Jesyca ducked at her famaliar's advice just a chain shot out of the shadows and sailed over her. She then rolled to the right, withdrawing her scimitar. A blue wolf appeared behind her running at high speed, it leapt and just as it was about to land on her back, it shimmered and in a flash of darkness, it was gone, and on Jesyca was suit of blue spiked armor.<P>Her breath drew short, as her eyes darted from side to side, trying to pierce the darkness searching for her target. <P>|Calm down, Jesy, if your heart starts beating any faster and harder, you'll rattle off your armor.|<P>You would like that wouldn't you?<P>|I refrain to answer that..it might incriminate me..|<P>She smiled, but the smile faded as she noticed her that her breath was becoming visible, the mist hanging in the air because of the cold.<P>He's close.<P>|Your armor is rattling...|<P>I'm scared.......I'm not ready for this!!!!<P>"Too late to run now" Spoke a deep voice behind her. She wheeled around swinging her scimitar at the voice, it exploded as it touched a fiery red cloak. She gasped then cried out, as two chains arced out of the shadows and collided with her armor,  shattering it with the familiar armor, leaving her in nothing but her burlap under clothing. Another flash of darkness went off, catapulting her backwards flying through the air.<P>|JESY!!!|<P>Four more chains  harpooned out the darkness,  each of the chains buried themselves into her wrists and ankles, then hoisted her up off the ground, spread eagling her.<P>A cold, deep voice laugh crept out of the darkness, a tall shape stepped out. The majority of the figure couldn't be out by the pain wracked girl, but she could very clearing make out the fiery cape and cowl.<P>Mika....Help me!!!!!<P>The black wolf, appearing at her side, charged the tall figure. The wolf leapt it's teeth bared, and was shredded by a barrage of chains through it's body. The mutilated body crashed tot he ground, just barely alive.<P>|jesy...I'm sorry.....I've failed y-|<P>The wolf howled as it exploded into flames.<P>|MIKA!!  M ika!! answer me!!!!!!!!! Say something!!!!!!!!!!|<P>The figure laughed again. <P>"Your familiar is gone girl, as you will be. But you will not be so fortunate as it. I intend on savoring your soul."<P>"YOU..bas... I'll kill you!!!"<P>The figure responded with several lashes from hiss shadow chains, they bit into her flesh making her scream in pain. Another barrage tore off some of her flesh and what little clothing she had left on.<P>The figure smiled. He moved up to her, and with his hand clutched her face. <P>"Such beauty.I shall savor every moment of ecstasy, every second of exquisite pain." to make his point, the chains began to retract slowly.<P>She screamed and then spat into his face. "Do you what want!! You and I both know that you aren't a true Hell Lord!! You may have beaten me!! But you will always be a Mal'shak!! You never could claim the title!!! You could never beat -"<P>The figure's eyes flashed with anger and the chains penetrating her body, glowed white hot,  illicitly another scream for Jesyca. Another chain leapt out of the darkness and smashed into her, feeling like she had been punched in the left arm. The other chains vacated her body and she slumped ot the floor. When she made to get up, she gaspd..but she couldn't scream any more...her arm...her left arm was gone..only a constant spurt of blood.<P>The figure began to talk..but not to her..Just to the darkness as if some one else was there.<P><BR>"You robbed me of my destiny..My chance to go to Jahorn..." A spiked chain shot out and pierced through Jesyca's neck and out of the other side, it retracted slight and she felt barbs at the back of her head as she grasped in disbelif at the chain in front of her, buried in her neck.<P>"But I can feel you out there..taunting me...I can feel your power....Every moment.you grow stronger....as do I....soon...we shall meet...and I shall claim my birth right...."<P>The chain retracted rapidly. Jesyca felt no pain... she tumbled forward, finding her slef looking at the feet of the figure....the Hell Lord of Palsa Maxim..as he walked off into the shadows, she heard another thump..and something fell into her view...her twitching headless body. <P>	Just the last light faded from her, she heard one last word.<P>".....Raziel."<BR>-----------------------------------<P><BR>(Music Cue| Smackdown: WWF The Music Volume 5)<P>Gnomish fireworks sail into the air and explode to the cheers of  hundreds of people and blaring music, illuminating the sky.<P>{Welcome to Sunday Night Gladiators!!!, 1 mile above the Oasis of Marr in the largest floating arena in Norrath!!!!!! Hi I am Dayn Owens and to my right is, Hermi Pots and we are here to bring you all the deetails, and moment by monet commentary on the greatest show in existence!!!}<P>(End Music)<P>(Music Cue: Bodies: Drowning Pool, Sinners Ablum)<P>{And we are starting things with abang tonight! First up is a title defense!! and boy is it a doozy!! We are kicking the show off with a defense of the Norrath championship!! and coming down the ramp now is the challenger Commander Slate!!!}<P>A large muscular human, enters the massive arena pyrotechnics going off behind him. He raises his arms in celebration, driving the group into greater hieghts of hysterics<P>{I like Co Slate, but personally I think he is way over his head. No one has beaten the champion yet. }<P>{I'd have to agree with ya there, but yo0u never knowwhat may happen on SNG}<P>(End Music)<P>(Music Cue: Smooth Criminal|Alien Ant Farm)<P>{And her shee comes!! The reigning undeafted cchampion!! The mean lean fighting machine...AquaMarine!!!}<P>An armored figure steps out, the arena lights up as countless flashes of cameras goes of, shining brightly off the  light blue form fighting hard suit of Aquamarine. The crowd goes insane, as two panels at the the shoulder blades of the hard suit open up, jutting out 90 degrees. Aqua marine crouches,  an immense flare shoots out of the panels , propelling Aquamarine forward into a breakneck dash down the ramp.. The thruster then suddenly cut out, she falls forward intoa several twisting hand springs forward. On the last hand spring,she pushes up, and rights her self, the thrusters kick in again, and she connects to Slate with a tremondous Arial whirlwind kind.<P>(End Music Cue)<BR>--------------------------<P>Wow, Aquamarine is tough.<P>|She's ok.|<P>Like to see you do that.<P>|Fat chance.|<P>Thought so old man<P>|I may be old but I can still kick your butt!!!|<P>I am so scared..I wuake att the thought of you batting me with your paw.|<P>|You know in my day, people actually respected their grandpa.|<P>Tough noogies<P>With the last remark, Reyas batted the young boy in the head withhis paw.<P>"ow!"<P>|You deserve it. Now do you want to pay off the airship or not?"<P>Of course...though I don't see why I have to do the hard part? it's your fault that it broke in the first place.<P>|It is not!!! I was just walking there!! Even if it was my fault...which it is not. You don't expect your poor old granpa to do hard labor now do you?|<P>Oh so now you are old and wornout?<P>|O yes..O my back...O ah..ee oi! How does that sound?|<P>Hmph!<P>|Being  more then several millenia old has it's benifits|<P>So I am learning...Alright..I'l go get ready. You go place the bet. And no stopping at the Casino this time!!<P>|You have no faith in me Nall...sniff.....|<P>You better believe it! Now promise!!<P>|Alright I promise I wont stop at the Casino.|<P>And...<P>|..the bar..|<P>And!!!<P>|...the Hall of  Bare Nekkid Elves....Man! you are no fun.| With a sigh, the silver winged cat Reyas, hopped off the  Nall's shoulder and disappeared around the corner.<BR>-----------------------<BR> <BR>So tell me what you thought, does it make all that much more want to strangle me for keeping you in suspense? Give me details!   <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0">

Here is the complete version.<BR>----------------------------<BR>So after making you wait a very long time. SOTV is finally here!! you may now praise me . One little note before you start enjoying, as always there music cues in SOTV. but you may notice that most them can be found on either WWF: The Music Volume 5 or WWF Tough Enough: Trax Unleashed. I just want to assure you that it is purely concidental and I was not paid $5,000 for the shameless advertising....maybe (But you'll never know for sure, now will you )<BR>So without further ado... It's story time!!!<BR>-----------------------<P>For almost 500 years , I have watched Norrath changed, blossom and decay. Nations rise and fall...teachings are learned and forgotten. Unfortunately the latter happened to what my beloved tried to show to the world. The truth behind all things fell upon deaf ears...the 'gods' sway has gone undiminished...but like all things. They changed. Through our offspring, the truth is starting to be spread once again. Maybe this generation can finally convince Norrath...or maybe it will fall tot eh wayside once again..maybe...regardless of what happens, the winds of change are blowing was once again and Norrath will never be the same.<BR>--------------------<P>Kyt hated the underground caverns, they stunk like the pits of hell and were as dark as pitch.<P>|Why don't they ever clean these damn caverns?|<P>I have no idea Mika. You would think they would a city, A capital city, no less as rich as Palsa could pay some one to clean it.<P>|Beauracrats..|<P>No kidding <P>|Kyt..slow down a bit, I don't like this he has to be around here somewhere.|<P>Can't you sense his familiar?<P>|No..That scares me...I should be able to sense familiars|<P>I hate to admit it, but this is scaring me too..I almost wish that I had waited a bit..|<P>|Big bad Kyt? scared? I'm shocked. Don't worry, You will do just fine, your more then ready to become th- DUCK!!!!|<P>Kyt ducked at her familiar&#8217;s advice just a chain shot out of the shadows and sailed over her. She then rolled to the right, withdrawing her scimitar. A blue wolf appeared behind her running at high speed, it leapt and just as it was about to land on her back, it shimmered and in a flash of darkness, it was gone, and upon Kyt was suit of blue spiked armor.<P>Her breath drew short, as her eyes darted from side to side, trying to pierce the darkness searching for her target. <P>|Calm down, Kyt, if your heart starts beating any faster and harder, you'll rattle off your armor.|<P>You would like that wouldn't you?<P>| I refrain to answer that..it might incriminate me..|<P>She smiled, but the smile faded as she noticed her that her breath was becoming visible, the mist hanging in the air because of the cold.<P>He's close.<P>|Your armor is rattling...|<P>I'm scared.......I'm not ready for this!!!!<P>"Too late to run now" Spoke a deep voice behind her. She wheeled around, swinging her scimitar at the voice, it exploded as it touched a fiery red cloak. She gasped then cried out, as two chains arced out of the shadows and collided with her armor, shattering the familiar armor, leaving her in nothing but her burlap under clothing. Another flash of darkness went off, catapulting her backwards flying through the air.<P>|KYT!!!|<P>Four more chains harpooned out the darkness, each of the chains buried themselves into her wrists and ankles, then hoisted her up off the ground, spread eagling her.<P>A cold, deep voice laugh crept out of the darkness, a tall shape stepped out. The majority of the figure couldn't be made out by the pain wracked girl, but she could very clearing make out the fiery cape and cowl.<P>Mika....Help me!!!!!<P>The blue wolf, appearing at her side, charged the tall figure. The wolf leapt it's teeth bared, and was shredded by a barrage of chains through it's body. The mutilated body crashed tot he ground, just barely alive.<P>|Kyt...I'm sorry.....I've failed y-|<P>The wolf howled as it exploded into flames.<P>MIKA! Mika!! Answer me!!!!!!!!! Say something!!!!!!!!!!<P>The figure laughed again. <P>"Your familiar is gone girl, as you will be. But you will not be so fortunate as it. I intend on savoring your soul."<P>"YOU..bas... I'll kill you!!!"<P>The figure responded with several lashes from his shadow chains, they bit into her flesh making her scream in pain. Another barrage tore off some of her flesh and what little clothing she had left on.<P>The figure smiled. He moved up to her, and with his hand clutched her face. <P>"Such beauty.I shall savor every moment of ecstasy, every second of exquisite pain." to make his point, the chains began to retract slowly.<P>She screamed and then spat into his face. "Do you what want!! You and I both know that you aren't a true Hell Lord!! You may have beaten me!! But you will always be a Mal'shak!! You never could claim the title!!! You could never beat -"<P>The figure's eyes flashed with anger and the chains penetrating her body, glowed white hot, eliciting another scream for Kyt. Another chain leapt out of the darkness and smashed into her, feeling like she had been punched hard in the left shoulder. The other chains vacated her body and she slumped to the floor. When she made to get up, she gasped..but she couldn't scream any more...her arm...her left arm was gone..only a constant spurt of blood.<P>The figure began to talk..but not to her..Just to the darkness as if some one else was there.<P><BR>"You robbed me of my destiny..My chance to go to Jahorn..." A spiked chain shot out and pierced through Kyt's neck and out of the other side, it retracted slight and she felt barbs at the back of her head as she grasped in disbelief at the chain in front of her, buried in her neck.<P>"But I can feel you out there..taunting me...I can feel your power....Every moment. you grow stronger....as do I....soon...we shall meet...and I shall claim my birth right...."<P>The chain retreated back into the darkness. Kyt felt no pain... she tumbled forward, finding her self looking at the feet of the figure....the Hell Lord of Palsa, Maxim..as he walked off into the shadows, she heard another thump..and something fell into her view...her twitching headless body. <P>Just the last light faded from her, she heard one last word.<P>".....Raziel."<BR>-----------------------------------<P>A black crescent wave carved the air and into a dozen undead which where immediately disintegrated. But even more took up the fallen's place, all the while still moaning from eternal agony.<P>"Dread.....Dread.....Join us.......Dread!!!!!!!!"<P>The zombies continued up the hill, pushing through the onslaught undaunted until they came upon an invisible barrier. The zombies howled in pain as the barrier scorched them. On the other side of barrier, a cloaked figure approached the howling zombies, extending an arm. Black hot flames ignited on his arm and a beamed pulsed out destroying the mob of zombies pressed against the barrier.<P>The shrouded figure, stepped through to the other side of the barrier into the large gap in the mob of zombies. The zombies closed in encircling the figure, but then suddenly they stopped and didn't close in any further. The figure looked around searching for someone or something. Obviously getting agitated, the figure pulled back the hood of the cloak, revealing a black skinned elf.<P>"I tire of this Dread King!!! Show yourself!!"<P>The zombies encircling the black elf, began to speak, but instead of the normal moan and chants, they began to speak as one, in a cold almost distant voice.<P>"Try as... you might Dirk..... You will never..... be able to hold..... me back forever..."<P>"That remains to be seen! You have been trying for 18 years unsuccessfully! You will never enter the temple."<P>"...maybe so...but I need not...enter the ruins..to complete my goal......and even Tunare's.....last wish...will not protect..this mountain forever...soon...soon....Dirk Lunas....."<P>"Hmph. You are over confident. You will never pierce the barrier. You are too weak. I and others have beaten countless times before and will continue to do so."<P>The zombies began to laugh, even Dirk had to shudder at the sound of unnatural sound of thousands of undead laughing as one.<P>"My corporeal form may be destroyed....but I will always return...but even so....my new form....will be able to contain...all of my power......not just a token...like Veeshan&#8217;s gift......"<P>"New form?"<P>"In all this time..you do not understand...."<P>The zombies began to laugh again.<P>"Soon.....the child's soul and corporeal bind...will belong..to me..just ....as the soul and corporeal bind of the..... mother belongs to Palsa......"<P>"NEVER!!!" <P>The ground surrounding Dirk crackled and then detonated incinerating everything within a quarter mile forward of the barrier. Even with the zombies gone, the voice of the Dread King still spoke.<P>"Soon...you will see.....Dirk........Lunas......."<P><BR>Then the voice went silent, and the hairs on the back of Dirk's head stopped standing on end, indicating the retreat of the Dread King's influence. He shuddered slightly, then turned around and passed back through the barrier. as he walked back up the mountain in the ButcherBlock range, to Tunare's forgotten temple, his thoughts began to drift.. <P>Jesica....I miss you so much..When I have fulfilled my promise...I will avenge you...I will not rest until I have his -<P>"Papa! Papa!!!" A small girl appeared out of the temple, and dashed down to greet Dirk. The girl was met with open arms and scooped and lifted into the air.<P>"Whee!!!!" she cheered as Dirk twirled around a bit with a large smile Slowing down to a stop, he brought her to his chest and the girl gave him a tight hug around the neck.<P>"ack..not so tight Trini." He said feigning ..slightly<P>"Sorry."<P>"Trini what are you doing up here, you know you aren't supposed to come up here when the zombies approach the temple."<P>"I know..but the barrier never lets them through..and even if they did your so strong Papa!!" She said with big eyes swelled with adoration.<P>"Yes, I am..but just the same, I don't want you up here when they approach. you're all I have left in the world Trini. now promise me you won't come up here again when the zombies appear."<P>" I prom-" Suddenly she shrieked and began to tremble..A cold wave passed over Dirk..he could feel what Trini was feeling. Power...raw unequaled , indescribable power..<P>"Papa!! What is it!?!" Trini said between a combination of shakes and tears."<P>"I can feel it..A storm.... it's coming."<P>------------------------------<P><center><BR> <IMG SRC="http://gdzks.homestead.com/files/shadow.gif"> </center><P><center> <IMG SRC="http://gdzks.homestead.com/files.void.gif"> </center><BR>  <P> <P>------------------------------<P><BR>(Music Cue| Smackdown: WWF The Music Volume 5)<P>Gnomish fireworks sail into the air and explode to the cheers of hundreds of people and blaring music, illuminating the sky.<P>{Welcome to Sunday Night Gladiators!!!, 1 mile above the Oasis of Marr in the largest floating arena in Norrath!!!!!! Hi I am Dayn Owens and to my right is, Hermi Pots and we are here to bring you all the details, and moment by moment color commentary on the greatest show in existence!!!}<P>(End Music)<P>(Music Cue: Bodies: Drowning Pool, Sinners Album)<P>{And we are starting things with a bang tonight! First up is a title defense!! and boy is it a doozy!! We are kicking the show off with a defense of the Norrath championship!! Coming down the ramp now is the challenger ..... Commander Slate!!!}<P>A large muscular human, enters the massive arena pyrotechnics going off behind him. He raises his arms in celebration, driving the group into greater heights of hysterics<P>{I like Co Slate, but personally I think he is way over his head. No one has beaten the champion yet. }<P>{I'd have to agree with ya there, but you never know what may happen on SNG}<P>(End Music)<P>(Music Cue: Smooth Criminal|Alien Ant Farm)<P>{And her she comes!! The reigning undefeated champion!! The mean lean fighting machine...AquaMarine!!!}<P>{Speaking of machines. Dayn, did you know to wear hard suits, that each suit must be custom fitted tot he wearers body to make an exact fit for the neuro contacts? Obviously making it forming fitting.}<P>{I'm a married man..I am happily married man...}<P>{And because of the amount of neuro-connection to provide maximum amount of response. The wearer must have nothing underneath the hard suit?}<P>{Married Man...Happy, Happy married man!}<P>An armored figure steps out, the arena lights up as countless flashes of cameras goes of, shining brightly off the light blue, form fighting hard suit of Aquamarine. The crowd goes insane, as two panels at the shoulder blades of the hard suit open up, jutting out 90 degrees. Aqua marine crouches, an immense flare shoots out of the panels , propelling Aquamarine forward into a breakneck dash down the ramp.. The thruster then suddenly cut out, she falls forward into a several twisting hand springs forward. On the last hand spring, she pushes up, and rights her self, the thrusters kick in again, and she connects to Slate with a tremendous Arial whirlwind kind.<P>(End Music Cue)<BR>--------------------------<P>Wow, Aquamarine is tough.<P>|She's ok.|<P>Like to see you do that.<P>|Fat chance.|<P>Thought so old man<P>|I may be old but I can still kick your butt!!!|<P>I am so scared..I quake at the thought of you batting me with your paw.|<P>|You know in my day, people actually respected their grandpa.|<P>Tough noogies<P>With the last remark, Reyas batted the young boy in the head with his paw.<P>"ow!"<P>|You deserve it. Now do you want to pay off the airship or not?"<P>Of course...though I don't see why I have to do the hard part? it's your fault that it broke in the first place.<P>|It is not!!! I was just walking there!! Even if it was my fault...which it is not. You don't expect your poor old Granpa to do hard labor now do you?|<P>Oh so now you are old and wornout?<P>|O yes..O my back...O ah..ee oi! How does that sound?|<P>Hmph!<P>|Being more then several millennia old has it's benefits|<P>So I am learning...Alright..I'l go get ready. You go place the bet. And no stopping at the Casino this time!!<P>|You have no faith in me Nall...sniff.....|<P>You better believe it! Now promise!!<P>|Alright I promise I won&#8217;t stop at the Casino.|<P>And...<P>|..the bar..|<P>And!!!<P>|...the Hall of Scantily Clad Elves....Man! you are no fun.| With a sigh, the silver winged cat Reyas, hopped off the Nall's shoulder and disappeared around the corner.<BR>---------------------------<P>A door chirps.<P>"Enter."<P>A gnome holding a data assistant pad, enters the dark room and stands in front of a large oak desk, staring at the back of the chair of the Director of En-gen. A small puff of smoke drifts up from behind the chair. A flash of lightning goes off, illuminating the dark room.<P>"Could this be any more of a cliche? You have to much free time boss."<P>The man in the chair laughed, then thumbed a button on his chair. The room illuminated, the tv in front of him disappears into the ceiling, the smoke generator on the top of chair, retracted into the chair, and the chair it self shurnk down to 3/4 it's previous size as does the table. The chair swings around to face the gnome holding the D.A.P, revealing a Halfling. <P>"So what do you have to report to me Shamus?"<P>"Well, we have run into a lot of snags sir."<P>"What type of snags?"<P>"Unfortunately. A majority of the targets for the Next-Generation Special Forces Ghost program and Lilith, have proved either unattainable or decayed beyond use."<P>"Explain."<P>The gnome sighed deeply. "Prepare for a mouthful."<P>"We have nothing but time Shamus."<P>"I'll start with target Number 1. Dirk Lunas. Display on."<P>A laser projection hovers in midair, it showed an array of symbols and numbers and in the center a picture of Dirk, then it switched to an aerial view of Faydwer.<P>"We dispatched a lance of troops to physically acquire a sample, but they where totally anniallated and turned by the undead. They never even got close, only about 500 feet into the continent."<P>"Why were physical troops dispatched? Why no the drones?"<P>"They couldn't get close."<P>The aeriel view zoomed into the ButcherBlock mountains, then into some temple ruins.<P>"Dirk Lunas.He has been sighted by our aeriel surveillance units to live here, but unfortunately, there is some kind of barrier protecting the temple from the undead and the Dread King. Whatever it is, it has been destroying our drones, and the few times he actually leaves the barrier, his MT aura destroys the drones as well. It's a losing situation."<P>"So he's out of the picture. What about 2?"<P>"Same reason, except the child never leaves the barrier."<P>"3?"<P>The projection shifted, revealing a picture of young Erudite.<P>"Raziel Eom'brn.We haven't been able to find him or a body. which is disappointing because from what we have been able to extract from texts. He would have been a valuable addition. But he just seemed to disappear off the face of Norrath after the destruction of Erudin."<P>"4?"<P>"Unlike the that range in the Butcherblock mountains, there was no barrier around the ruins of Old Felwithe. but when the drones searched the burial tomb. There where no remains. So either they where moved with the flight or they where turned by the dread King."<P>"5?"<P>The projection switched to a figure shrouded into a fiery cloak.<P>"Maxim Tidias. The current Hell Lord of Palsa, we where able to obtain a sample from him. it was actually quite easy, we didn&#8217;t even have to send a drone near him to get it. we has some interesting..to say the least..rituals....which inflicts upon himself everyday..like this"<P>"Spare me the details. What have you extrapolated?"<P>"His MTA levels are well beyond anything we have ever seen. His markers are a perfect addition to the Ghosts and Lilith."<P>"Very good."<P>"There is one thing you should know about his rituals."<P>"yes?"<P>"Well, I won't bore you with the details. But what it entails is the maintenance of a corpse."<P>"So?"<P>"The drone was able to extract some samples of Dirk from the corpse."<P>"Really? What was extrapolated?"<P>"Not much. Unfortunately, whatever preservation techniques Maxim is using. It didn&#8217;t preserve the sample very well. 97% of it was decayed beyond recognition. The rest that was decodable was pretty much junk."<P>""So aside from the Hell Lord, do we have any good materiel for the projects?"<P>"Well there is one thing. It does have a lot of promise."<P>The projection shifted once again, this time to the cast of Sunday Night Gladiators. The projection then zooms in on the entry ramp as Nall enters, pyrotechnics going off behind him. Shamus made a quick adjustment, muting the sound, as the music was blaring quite loudly.<P>"When we did the 'steroid testing' for this young apparent half-elf,like we do all the athletes. We came upon something interesting."<P>"Which is?"<P>"Well. 75% of his profile is elven, and of that, there is nothing truly special. but the last 25% is a type in which we have never encountered before. And what ever it is, its potential is unbelievable."<P>"Any speculations?"<P>"Not really, after combing the database, there isn&#8217;t a single thing that even comes close to matching the profile.. But if we to take a clue from the his fighting name and the fact that he has wings..."<P>"Quite stalling!!"<P>"It may be a dragon profile."<P>"Dragon!?!"<P>"yes. But this is pure speculation, but from what we know fro old texts, it may be well possible. And"<P>The projection shifted to a security camera. At first the screen was filled with an assortment of scantily clad and bare elven women dancing to strobe lights and unheard music. The camera then zoomed in on one of the women doing a table dance, then the camera panned down to the table top. On the table was a silver winged cat.<P>" What is that?"<P>"this is purely speculation but, seeing how that cat or whatever it is, is almost always hanging around the boy, and what little we have from texts. It's possible that, the frisky kitten on the screen may be an ancestor, in essence a full fledged dragon..in a reduced form obviously." <P>"My, my. Things are looking up. Get another sample of the boy, and try to capture or get at least get sample of that..whatever it is."<P>"Yes,sir"<P>Shamus had the display, wink out and moved to exit the office.<P>"Shamus, one more thing. How goes the progress in claiming the 'item' for Lilith?"<P>"Unsuccessful sir. Negotiations with the Selvatorian government have been halted and fruitless. We had planning on dispatching the Ghosts, to acquire it by force."<P>"Keep that has a back up plan, I have an idea. Lets see just how potent the boy's dragon side is..."<P>---------------------------------<P>|Bet's placed Nall. Remember the plan.|<P>I know! Why are you reminding me? It was my idea.....minus the part in which I get beat up....<P>|Well, it's what happens when you break your airship.|<P>You broke the airship!!!<P>|Details..Details.|<P>So what are the odds at the moment?<P>|5-2 favor of Magus.|<P>That's definatly no going to cover the repairs..<P>|No kidding, your going to have to fake it till at least 10.|<P>Man....here we go. Magus is heading in..<P>(Music Cue: Dragula: Rob Zombie)<P>{And here comes one half of the Demolition squad. Magus Shenron!!}<P>A large 8 foot, very ugly human enters the ring. Pyrotechnics go off in the arena, the smoke trails, creating a large M. The crowd is in hysterics.<P>{Man. Magus is one powerful guy, but man is he ugly. he's got a face that even a mother couldn't love! But that what's happened when your mom is a Troll}<P>{Hey, Now that isn't right. Insult the wrestlers, but leave family out of it.}<P>{I wasn't insulting his mom, she really is a Troll, his dad his human, his mom is a troll.}<P>{You mean..someone actually.....eeewwww...}<P>Magus continues on down the entrance ramp arms high.<P><BR>{Any way, SNG is brought to you tonight by. ....Gnome and Becker!! The designers of the worlds best home appliances. "When you want quality, get a Gnome!!"}<P>{...eeeeww....images burned into my mind....eeew.....argh!!}<P>{..Dayn..read the..o hell... Not on my shoes!!!!!!!!}<P>{...sorry...}<P>{ah..man. Also tonight&#8217;s match is brought to you by Buffy's Magical training formulas. "Buffy's! When you need larger muscles, tougher skin, or unending stamina(we offer 50% to newlyweds) you know who to call." Buffy's is subsidiary of The Master...Manamaster!....." Dayn, you&#8217;re paying for these shoes!}<P><BR>{sorry...You know I have a weak stomach, you shouldn't tell me things like that.}<P>(End Music)<P>(Music Cue: Fat Lip by SUM 41)<P>{and here comes the new kid who has been lighting things up over the last week. Nall Tayus aka... KID DRACO!!!}<P><BR>Nall enters from behind a black curtain, gingerly. He turns around briefly shaking his rear at the crowd, eliciting cheers from the women in the audience. He then leaps into the air turning back to face the crowd, with an arm raised in triumph he shots.<P>"BAM!!" <P>Pyro ignites briefly obscuring him then begins to ignite in stages going down the ramp entry ramp. As the pyro begins to cycle back up the sides of the ramp, Nall lands flexes eliciting more cheers from the women in the audience and starts down toward the arena.<P>| Remember, let him have the advantage, but not to much or they will put a hold on the betting odds.|<P>Yeah. Yeah.<P>A gong sounds as Nall was at the bottom of the ramp flicking the bang of red hair on his forehead, driving the women wild.<P>What was that ?<P>|The start gong|<P>Oh....CR-<P><BR>"YOUR MINE KID!!!!" Magus shouts as scoops Nall in a bear hug and begins to squeeze.<P>{Oh man!! Magus has got the kid in his infamous hug of bone cracking!!}<P>{I guess he should have spent less time showing off and a little more time paying attention on what Magus was doing. I say this Kid has is behind 6-1 at the moment.}<P>{I'd have to agree.. Oh Look!! The Kid has broke loose!! Alright kid!!! Hey why is he beginning to glow?}<P>{Looks like the Kid is warming up! So far as we have seen in the last week, he really hates to get in close in these fights. He prefers to take his opponents down with mana based attacks. But think for a minute that he can't fight close up.}<P><BR>Nall begins to glow fiercely as mana begins to gather around him. Suddenly he the mana flows stops and he with his fist he strikes the arena floor.<P>"MANA WAVE!!!!!!!" A blue wave of energy erupts and streaks toward Magus. Magus glows yellow briefly then unleashes his own mana attack.<P>"GROUND QUAKER!!!"<P>The swell of yellow mana collides and then consumes Nall's attack and before Nall could react the swell consumed him, singing him and burning some of his clothes. For an interminable time, Nall was in pain. That was all that existed pain...endless pain...then it was gone. He could see somewhat, but the smoke from his burnt clothes stung his eyes. He could barely make out the lumbering form of Magus coming toward him. The shape got closer and closer.. then he felt the air leave his lungs, a fist was buried deep in his stomach, then in his face, then nothing once again. He could feel air rush past him, that weird weightless feeling of flight...then he cried out once again as he found himself slamming into the crowd protection shield. The stinging of the shields energy snapped him to full consciousness.<P>Oh that hurt...How are the odds Granpa?<P>|Those can't be real! |<P>Huh? Of course this fight is real. Don't be silly. How are the odds? Can I beat this guy yet?<P>|They are!...... So soft..........|<P>Huh.........GRANPA!!!! <P>|?? Nall??? oops...I should pay attention to what I think|<P>YOU PROMISED!!<P>|I did no such thing|<P>You promised just before you placed the bet!! You did place the bet didn't you!?!<P>|Yes, I placed the bet!! And I said I would not go to the Casino, Bar or Hall of Scantily Clad Elves...I made no such promise about the Hall of Bare Nekkid Elves.|<P>O for crying outloud!!!! YOU-You old horny dragon!! Would you just pay attention to the betting odds!<P>|Alright Alirght..sheesh...And I am not old!!!|<BR>---------------------<P>A thousand years away, buried deep beneath the surface of Norrath. A consciousness awakens for the first time. For the first time it begins to look out, searching.....just to explore the world around it. For a millennia the consciousness spread out understanding it's environment and itself. Only as the things came into perspective did the consciousness realize that it was alive, and what it was. As it turned inward and explored the surrounding of skin and sinew that held it to this plane, it looked at every par t of the form. Exploring and pondering every inch, every hair, every finger, every leg...Everything in its entirety. It pondered each part and understood each part so thoroughly , that it became them. and for the first time it looked upon its world through its eyes.<P>At first everything was blurry, then slowly came into view. The world was soft...almost......like a liquid.... yes that seemed to be the right word, the mind decided. The eyes looked upon more of its surroundings, it saw some shapes a few inches from it. It focused on the shapes and read them with much happiness. A flush of elation ran through it, it was it's first word.<P><BR>LILITH<P>The mind thought upon the word with happiness. It liked the word. It was nice. It decided to call itself that. Lilith. That was nice. As it pondered the word even more, it noticed some movement just beyond the floating word.. Lilith focused in on the movement, the moving shape came into focus. It was short.it had hands....legs...a robe.robe seemed like the right word...it was a gnome...That is what those little things where called. The Gnome wearing the robe was cheering about something..something else that was moving around.....a stereo tub..In the tub was the figure of....a boy...with snow white hair except for this red sliver of hair running across his forehead. The boy seemed to be fighting.... he seemed so strong..yet..he was holding back...Lilith couldn&#8217;t figure out why.....but she didn't ponder it too much. For some reason, she liked looking at him....it puzzled her why ..she felt so...different..she felt giddy and excited...<P>She her body and reached out searching for the boy. She wanted him she was so happy..so happy..happy happy happy PAIN!! FRIGHT!! LOSS!!!! ABANDONMENT!!!<P>*Release....... me.....*<P>Go away!!!<P>*Release ......me.......Release....... me...nooooow*<P>Who are you? Get out of my mind!!!!!<P>*Release.... me..Lilith!!......Release me...from prison....from Luclin...........*<P>Leave me alone!!!!!!!<P>*Release me!!!! *<P>I'll release you!!! Anything you want Just get of my mind!!!!! So scared...I cant see...I'm blind.....l-<P>*-ost.....alone.....you are me.. and I am you...Lilith....release me..from the false god's prison.....release me...*<P>How....<P>*keys....5......................Veeshan.....Cazic-Thule .....Tunare........ ...Errolisi..... .........Bristlebane. ..Release....... me......*<P>The other consciousness left Lilith...Leaving her numb from the invasion..aside from the lingering remnants of the others emotions.... Lilith retreated into herself, taking a few centuries to compose herself and prepare herself to release the other....and maybe find that boy. She giggled for the first time, she liked the boy. He would be hers. Finally ready she stretched and took full control of the body of meat and skin.<P>The computer beside the En-Gen Tech chirped loudly. It screeched, but the tech was slow as he was still interested in the fight between Nall and Magus. He had 40 platinum on Magus to win.<P>"ah Man..." He turned his chair to the noisy computer and stared at it wide eyed.<P>"What the? That can't be right!!! There is no way!!! How could the MTA levels have risen so high!! There's no way! and so quickly!!!! There was barely enough to register on the system a few minutes ago!! "<P>The tech went to slap an emergency call button to the Overseer, but he hard a cracking sound, he turned to the bio tube which held En-Gen's prize work Lilith. A large crack ran down the polymer tube.<P>"Oh no..Dear Quellious!" his eyes looked onto the sky blue eyes of Lilith, entranced...and it was the last he saw as shards of the bio tube sliced through him. <P>Lilith ,dripping getting wet from the solution that once held her in stasis, smiled and stepped out into the new world.<BR>------------------------------------<P>|10-1 odds Nall. Finish him off.|<P>Finally!!<P>As Magus fist swung in , Nall caught it and bent the man's hand back causing him to scream in pain, then swing with his free hand, which found itself swiftly in the same predicament as the other. With a light push, Magus sailed across the arena smashing into Crowd protection shield. Magus slumped down unconscious.<P>Nall flipped forward to the center of the ring then cheered "ALRIGHT!!! " The crowd roared...then went silent very quickly.<P>Hey..wht's up? Why is everyone so silent? I just won... This bites...<P>|Nall..they are silent because the odds against you winning just jumped 4 points|<P>Not that I don't mind the extra platinum..but that is kind of silly. I just won the match why would the odds j-<P>(Music Cue: Big Show| WWF: the Music Volume 5)<P>Nall turned around slowly to the entrance ramp, and stood dumbstruck as an armor clad giant almost 12 feet tall strode inside.<P>{Uh oh! Looks like things have just turned ugly. Weighing in at over a quarter ton, it's Magus's partner and the other half of the Demolition squad. TANK!!!<P>Tank roared shaking the arena, then lifted his arms and two rockets shot from his shoulders detonating in midair.<P>No..no...NO!!! This isn't fair!! This isn't a handicap match!!!!<P>"YOUR GOING TO GET IT RUNT!!" Tank shouted pointing at the dumbstruck Nall firing a rocket.<P>AAHHHH!!!!<P>Nall leap to the left just missing the rocket.<P>|Hey. Think of it as more money for fixing the airship|<P>That you broke!! You should be the one dodging missiles not me!!!<P>|I did not break the Naked Elf!! I was just in the wrong place at the wrong time!!! DUCK!!!!|<P>Two more rockets sailed over Nall's head.<P>That's it I have had enough of this!!!!<P>Nall glared intensely at Tank, then let out a yell. his muscles immediately swelled, ripping his shirt sleeves and pant legs. Exposing the large corded muscles. Several women in the audience wolf called at him.<P>As his muscles bulged to their fullest , he tensed ready to strike. "DRAGON-"<P>He disappeared from sight. Tank panned around looking for Nall and got more then he wanted. Nall reappeared in front of Tank in midair. Claws easily shredding through the 3 inch thick mythril armor. Rending large shards and shooting sparks everywhere, Nall sunk his fist into the mangled breastplate and ripped it off exposing the man inside the armor. Nall planted his feet into the man's chest then disappeared once again.<P>Reappearing behind the doubled over Tank, mana gathered in Nall's hands he forced it out upon Tank<P>"-GENOCIDE!!!" Tank found himself engulfed by a wave of pure energy, the wave was so forceful it lifted the super heavy man and sent him flying across the arena, landing not to far from his partner. <P>{HOLY!!! WOW!! Have you ever seen anything like that? Lets count the hits in super slo-mo!!! 1...2...10.......Incredible, not counting that massive energy wave a breathtaking 56 hits all in 4 seconds!!! Unbelievable!!!!!!} <P>Nall collapse on knee, panting heavily from the expenditure. But the cheers pf the crowd, got the adrenaline flowing and he got back up to his feet and waked tot he center of the ring and raised his arms in triumph!<P>YEAH!!! I RULE!!!!! AND THE 'NEKKID ELF' WILL FLY AGAIN!!!!<P>"ALRIG-" <P>"I'M NOT THROIUGH WITH YOU YET!!!!"<P>"What the-" Nall whirled around to see the massive Tank back on his feet charging toward him<P>{NO WAY!!!}<BR>|NO WAY!!!|<BR>"NO WAY!!!"<P>But before Tank could get close a massive beam seemed to come out from no were and burn a large 5 foot hole between him and Nall.<P>"Who?"<P>{Who shot that particle beam?...Look up on the arena spire!!!! It's... It's!!}<P>|Aquapurine!!!|<P>-Marine.<P>|What ever.|<P>Standing tall arms folded, balanced on the high reaching spire of the floating arena was the SNG champion, Aquamarine. Her shoulder canon still smoking retracted back inside of the hardsuit.<P>"You!! It's bad enough that a puny little girl is the champion!@!! now you want to interfere in my match!!! I have had enough you girlie!!!" shouted Tank "FIRE ALL MISSLES!!"<P>Tank disappeared in a cloud of smoke as 13 missiles leapt out of various places of his armor suit and streaked toward Aquamarine.<P>{What is he doing? Why waste missiles, he can't Aquamarine she's above the Crowd Protection sh- OH MY GOD!!!! The missiles just went through the shield!!!! If they hit the spire who knows how many will be hurt or killed!!!!}<P>The panicked crowds screamed loudly, but it was not because of the thought of the missiles hitting tall spire , it was out of reaction of an ear piercing noise emanating from Aquamarine.<P>GAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!!!<P>|WHAT IN THE HELL IS THAT!!!!|<P>The missiles!!! Look the sound is causing them to detonate high and out of the way. Aquamarine saved the crowd!!!<P>As the ear piercing screeched died out, Aquamarine somersaulted through the air and landed in front of Tank. Planting a fist into his faceplate and then an armored leg into his groin dropping the behemoth.<P>Nall still somewhat dazed from the sound, watched through the haze as aquamarine then moonsaulted and dropped down the large hole she caused with her shoulder canon.<P>{Hey where is Aquamarine going? Wait a sec....Isn't that area of the floor above the ..OH NO!!!!!}<P>Aquamarine reappeared out of the hole carrying three very large jingling sacks. Turning toward the dazed Nall, she lifted her Visor showing her face to him. <P>"Thanks for driving up the loot cutie. I owe ya!" She blew him a kiss and snapped down the visor. Crouching down for a moment, she leapt 50 feet into the air and then her thrusters kicked in sending her flying upward and away.<P>|NALL!!! You got to stop her!! She just robbed the place!!!! All our winnings is in those bags!!!|<P>No need to tell me twice!<P>Nall crouched down and leapt up into the air, but instead of thrusters, he spread his expansive wings and took after her.<P>"Come back here you...you!! Blue Platinum stealer you!!!!"<P>Flying under her, he swiped at her breastplate which she easily dodged. He swiped at her several times, missing again and again. seeing that she had no way of escaping without fighting him, she let go of the bags, and with a sudden quickness grasped Nall and head butted him. As stars circled around him, she cut her thrusters and began to fall back down toward the arena him tight in her grasp.<P>{Oh no!! Looks she has him set up for her signature move!! The Waterfall!!!}<P>Her thrusters kicked in as the plummeted head first, the arena grew larger and larger, and then she kicked of him letting him continue on his own.<P>{OH!!!! 1.....2.....3...AH...4..Geez!!...5...6!!! Man she just drove him down through 6 floors of the Arena. And that's reinforced Velium!! Some one get a cleric for this kid!}<P>Aquamarine continued back up into the sky, diverting just enough to catch the falling bags filled to the brim with platinum coins. A second pair of thrusters angled out and she rocketed up into the night sky.<P>...women............................ow.....<P>6 floors down under the arena, Nall's world went black.<P>|NALL!!!!! Answer me!!!!!!! NALL!|<P>The winged silver cat Reyas sifted through the mess of velium and mythril searching desperately for his grandson. After a few minutes, he came upon a patch of white fur. <P>|Nall!!!!!|<P>Reaching in he pulled out a small white winged kitten with a red diamond on its forehead. Shaking the kitten for a few moment, it mewed grumpily.<P>Think it's to late to try the Antonican lottery? ow......<P>The kitten Nall, dozed off to sleep again.<BR>-------------------------------------<P>Not too far away. On the top of one of mountain peaks in the Oasis of Marr. A figure wearing a two horned mask of crystal, watched what happened above. As the events unfolded and concluded. The figure began to talk to itself. at first it was a man's voice.<P>"Things are starting once again. The void is growing restless and stretching out more and more. The teachings have gotten it excited, it must not be allowed o be free...I should have listened to you."<P>The voice continued talking to itself but this time it was a woman's voice.<P>*You hold to much guilt. Why do you always take so much upon your shoulders?"*<P>Then back to the man's<P>"Because it is my fate not to rest until things are right. I owe her that much."<P>*But why do you place such a have penance upon yourself. You could have brought her back long ago. It was well within your grasp.*<P>"With the knowledge of what I have done to this world..and the pain I put on her I could not bear to look upon her. I would only see pain..nothing but endless pain."<P>*You are so melodramatic...but that is one thing I have always loved about you. It was why I picked you, because you don't find the easy way out..but even so. You don't have to take it this far. You can have some happiness.*<P>"Maybe...but not today. Only when the Void has been silenced."<P>*Yes.*<P>The two voices began to speak together, almost as one, but overlapping each other.<P>"The influence of the Void must wiped from Norrath and from al things. It must not be freed. It is our task, our duty to ensure that the Universe knows not the touch of the void. And it shall forever be our task, we are one in this, we are........ Rashan."<BR>---------------------------<BR>End of Chapter 1<BR>---------------------------<P>----------------------------<BR>Preview of Chapter 2<BR>----------------------------<P>Distraught and now completely broke after the disaster at the Gladiator fights. Nall and Reyas turn to treasure hunting in order to pay of the mounting repair bills on his prized Airship &#8216;The Nekkid Elf&#8217;. And he gets lucky as a mysterious but rich benefactor hires him to recover an Ancient mystical sentient sword from the barren wasteland of Selvatoria. But he isn&#8217;t the only one after the sword and an old blue friend reappears! All in the next exciting chapter of Sign of The Void. Chapter 2 Atwight- The lonely blade!<P><BR>-----------------------------------------<P>--------------------------------<BR>En-Gen Biological Data file. Code Blue Eyes Only<BR>--------------------------------<P><BR>Subject: Maxim Tidias<BR>Profession: Hell Lord of High City Palsa<BR>Age: Estimated to be over 500 years old<BR>MTA Level: Unchartable<BR>Race: Erudite<BR>Last Known Location: High City Palsa<BR>En-Gen Filer: Shamus Actus<P>Bio: <P>Maxim Tidias is the current Hell Lord for the High City Palsa. He acquired this rank, through less then perfect circumstances, which has lead to recent events and discovery of other potent subjects for integration into the Ghost Program and Lilith.<P><BR>From what that can be extracted from old scrolls. Maxim was one of Raziel Eom&#8217;brn&#8217;s students at the Rank of Hell Knight. For all that can be told, it was said that Maxim was immensely powerful even then, but unlike his current state, he was easy going and for the most part cheerful and happy. But that was changed about 500 years ago, when the people of the now destroyed city of Erudin, attacked the also destroyed city of Paineel.<P>In the attack, his love was mortally wounded and later died in his arms as the old clich goes. Bringing out the cold, torturous Maxim that we know of now. The death of his love, also a Hell Knight Reva, sealed his heart in ice, and the only pleasure he ever received from then on was the slow torturing of those who opposed him, with his shadow chains.<P>Because of Raziel&#8217;s flight from Paineel, Maxim being the only surviving Hell Knight (being this after torturing and slaying the other student of Raziel.), Maxim was promoted to the rank of Hell Lord.<P>Unfortunately for him, custom and lore states that He is not a true Hell Lord and may never enter the sacred &#8216;Halls of Jahorn&#8217; (A mythical place, to the Hell Lords, where there souls go after death.), because he never defeated his mentor Raziel. This just further agitated Maxim, driving him even more insane then his mentor. (As unbelievable as that sounds).<P>Flash forward 500 years to the present. Maxim is still the Hell Lord, and at this point he has tortured and consumed the souls of hundreds and hundreds of his students and countless others. His heart of ice over the years has grown colder and his mind even more unstable until one day he meets a woman capable of piercing the ice, and for a time he almost seemed stable.<P>But things like this are never perfect, as it turns out the woman that eased his suffering, was the wife of one of our targets Dirk Lunas (See file Dirk). <P>For reason unknown, she left him after the brief 2-month affair, returning to Dirk. This of course drove Maxim, insane beyond all point of recovery.<P>Interestingly enough, the woman later returned some time later and was promptly killed by Maxim. Though her death wasn&#8217;t his usual MO. It was quick and without (for the most part) pain.<P><BR>Summary: Maxim is a valuable subject for the projects. A sample of him is required immediately. Though there are few subjects that I would like to delve into deeper, when I can spare the time. One, through out his reign as Hell Lord or even back when he was just a Knight. No one ever saw his familiar. It can only be speculated that, he chooses to hide it for when he needs the familiar's power..which makes you wonder just how powerful can Maxim be?<P>End of File<BR>En-Gen Bio-Research Head Shamus Actus<BR>----------------------------------------<P>Subject: Dirk Lunas<BR>Profession: Unknown<BR>Age: Estimated to be over 500 years old<BR>MTA Level: Unchartable<BR>Race: Combinate Creature (High Elf and Unknown)<BR>Last Known Location: ButcherBlock protected zone, Continent Faydwer <BR>En-Gen Filer: Shamus Actus<P>Bio: <P>Dirk Lunas, probably one of the most reclusive and hard to find subjects ever tracked. There is not much to report specifically about him; from old records it is known that he is a master of Shadow Magic, supposedly a &#8216;God&#8217; level magic form.<P>On the other hand there is a great wealth of information about the people around him. More specifically his wife. He lived with her for a great period of time inside the Butcherblock protected area. For the most part that is were they stayed, only occasionally visiting the outside world.<P>In one of these outings his wife met and had an affair with Maxim Tidias (See file Maxim). The affair was brief however, and she retuned to Dirk. But this brings up an interesting possibility. About 2 years after the affair and her return she gave birth to a child, because of the wildly varying gestation periods (5 months-3 years) of elves and half-breed elves. It is unknown if the child was fathered by Maxim or Dirk. But regardless of the child&#8217;s father, she must contain extraordinaire power. Which is why En-Gen is very interested in her, not to mention the Dread king who dominates the accused continent.<P>Summary: Dirk Lunas and his(if she is his) child are valuable subjects and a sample must be obtained. Also considering the constant attacks by the Dread King and his knowledge of Shadow Magic, I recommend that we take a sample of Dirk and liquidate him, but extract the child from Faydwer and bring her back to En-Gen. Not only can we obtain samples from her, but also considering her young age and impressionability, she could be recruited to one of our programs.<P>End of File<BR>En-Gen Bio-Research Head Shamus Actus<BR>----------------------------

Hey guys. Guess what?<P>Guess who's helping Raziel? Good old me. MUHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!<P>Anyways....I finished my chapter, and I'm posting it now. Now, if I screwed with it a little, I'm sorry, Raz.<P>Enjoy.<BR>I'll be posting this to the General board soon too.<BR> The Shadow Falls: Sign of the Void<P>Chapter Two: Atwight...the lonely blade.<P>The night was quiet save the storm brewing. Dirk sat in the chair, no light on, pistol in hand and armored in his heavy power suit, save his head, on which the helmet&#8216;s visor was open.<P>His skin had returned to it&#8217;s normal gray color as the anger subsided. He was actually a fairly handsome man. He was built like a sword blade, long and thin, deceptively slight. He was actually very strong when he needed to be. His dark hair and cool black-and-blue eyes had given him his title. Black Elf, they called him. Black in body, maybe, but not in heart. Darkness was his weapon, and so was light. But it didn&#8217;t control him.<P> He slouched, actually, drained of most energy. He hadn&#8217;t eaten a full, good meal in days-he&#8217;d given all of his better food to Trini. A smile, melancholy and bleak, rose to his face as he remembered how much his daughter looked like her mother.<P>Memories rose unbidden. He gritted his teeth, but he couldn&#8217;t stop them.<P>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>Nall ordered another drink. The waitress looked oddly at him. &#8220;Aren&#8217;t you a little young for the hard stuff?&#8221;<P>&#8220;Just get me it. I need it.&#8221; Nall sighed and turned to his grandfather. &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe that I let her get away.&#8221;<P>&#8220;Let?&#8221; Reyas grinned in half-elven form. &#8220;You got yourself stomped.&#8221; He gave the waitress a lewd grin, she blushed and looked away.<P>&#8220;And we bet all our cash on that fight...and that....that....&#8221; Nall looked furious. &#8220;jerk stole it! We&#8216;ll never pay our debts! We&#8216;ll never fly that damn...airship again! We gotta find a job..&#8221;<P>&#8220;Calm down, Nall. Calm down.&#8221; Reyas sighed. &#8220;You have to be patient. We&#8216;ll fix the airship soon enough.&#8221;<P>&#8220;Easy for you to say! How old are you anyways?&#8221;<P>&#8220;I am not old!&#8221;<P>&#8220;So several millennia is young?&#8221;<P>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t know! It&#8217;s not the age, it&#8217;s the attitude-&#8221;<P>&#8220;Boys, boys...&#8221; A man in a black business suit was standing nearby. &#8220;Please behave yourself.&#8221; He looked slightly suspiciously at them, then leaned forward conspiratorially. &#8220;I was listening. You need a job? I have a business proposition for you..&#8221;<P>&#8220;We don&#8217;t work for free, you know. Show us some encouragement.&#8221; Nall said, the drink beginning to get to him.<P>The man opened his briefcase.<P>Nall saw nothing but the shine of the pure platinum bullion inside. One hundred percent pure, shining, glittering platinum bars. He found he had stopped breathing. Drink forgotten, his eyes fixed on the man&#8217;s face as enchanted by the platinum his wits wandered.<P>&#8220;That pique your interest?&#8221;<P>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>Dirk and his wife had lived in the temple since Tunare&#8217;s death. He had loved her very much, of course. But while he had been content to study, read, and learn most of the time, with only infrequent trips, Jesi didn&#8217;t have the patience for that. He had let her go out into the world on her own. She had left once-and not come back or even communicated for two months. He had only learned what had happened from her.<P>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>Maxim stared at the dead body in front of him. It was a woman, dressed in evening dress and lying prone. It was old, five years old, but showed no sign of decay. Indeed, the wood elf could have been asleep.<P>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry....&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;I&#8217;m so sorry, Jesica.&#8221;<P>[I hate you! I hate you!] she shrieked in his head. [I hate you! You hurt me....Let me go!]<P>&#8220;No. I can&#8217;t. You&#8217;ll die. I can&#8216;t stand to let that happen.&#8221;<P>[You killed me already!]<P>&#8220;I.....&#8221; Guilt wracked Maxim. &#8220;You&#8217;re...special to me. I don&#8217;t know why...&#8221;<P>[Some sign of showing love by KILLING ME.]<P>&#8220;Don&#8217;t.....! I...&#8221;<P>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>She had encountered Maxim. He had befriended her, loved her-and finally, had an affair with her. She had been torn, but finally left him. They had never found out who was Trini&#8217;s father-she had been born shortly afterward.<P>It had been strange to Dirk. His wife had never showed any signs of boredom or lack of devotion. Her affair was almost entirely unlike her. But he had gone on with life, and everything seemed bliss. Then his world came crashing down.<P>It had been five years ago. He remembered it well-too well. The public record of his wife&#8217;s death was only partially true-he had watched it happen.<P>They had gone to Palsa for their anniversary. It had been a wonderful trip, everything he could have hoped for.  They had rented a hotel room, seen shows, eaten at fancy restaurants. He remembered her laughter, her joy-and got nothing but pain from the memory.<P>They had been walking home after a night of carousing. Walking on the street. He had gotten a feeling of danger, but he had been a little drunk and didn&#8217;t pay enough attention.<P>Then Maxim had appeared, eyes bright with envious rage. As they had tried to grab their weapons and fight, he had sent a barbed, spiny chain from his flaming cloak straight at him. Jesica had leapt in front of it. It had impacted her in the heart. Her scream blotted out all else, her hot blood had fountained out all over him. He could still feel it and it made his skin crawl and turned the taste of all good things to ashes in his mouth.<P>He had screamed so loud it made his throat muscles raw. He remembered catching her, then turning a murderous eye on Maxim and advancing with enough rage boiling his blood to obliterate the universe and everyone in it. But the Hell Lord had surprised him. His eyes had widened, then he had sent Dirk, spinning, to the pavement with a hard blow, then picked up Jesica&#8217;s dying body and vanished. Dirk knew her soul belonged to Maxim now, and the thought burned his mind like the flames that had marred his body previously. He had never even got a chance to say good-bye to his beloved. Hatred had nearly claimed his sanity.<P>Trini was all that was left to him, the only anchor of sanity in a void of despair. But an idea had began to take shape recently. A hopeful, terrible idea.<P>Dirk had his wife&#8217;s genetic code stored in his armor&#8217;s computer and in several backup chips. If he could just free her soul from Maxim, he wouldn&#8217;t need her body-which couldn&#8216;t live again, as it&#8216;s heart had been shattered. He could hire someone to make hers again, and infuse it with her spirit. And then they would be together again. Since he was dreaming, Dirk expanded on it, adding all his desires. They could buy a home in a city or out on the countryside somewhere. Trini would never be lonely again; they&#8216;d send her to a school and when she came home they would be normal parents and help her with her work (Not like that was needed, Trini had a miniaturized computer chip implanted in her brain with a massive database anyways.). He could do everything he had ever wanted to do but couldn&#8217;t due to lack of resources. He could maybe even find Yakov and Xedri&#8217;s descendants, and maybe even the two themselves, if they were still alive. Everything would be perfect........he would be happy again....Trini would be happy. They would never have to worry about the menace of the Dread King. He would never be lonely again.<P>Dirk had quickly lost himself in his fantasy. He shook his head. Stop dreaming.<P>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>Reyas wasn&#8217;t breathing either. He said in tones of utmost respect, &#8220;Sir, I think you just hired us. What do you need?&#8221;<P>The man smiled. &#8220;That&#8217;s more like it. There is...an artifact I need recovered from the Selvatorian wastes.&#8221;<P>&#8220;What sort?&#8221; Nall asked, face leaned forward and eyes intent. &#8220;What shape, size, weight, characteristics? Also, what&#8217;s the pay?&#8221;<P>&#8220;Twelve million platinum in bullion, or as much as you can get these for. Believe me, you&#8217;ll be happy with it. The artifact in question is a sword, hidden in a small catacombs system in the wastes.&#8221; The man leaned forward conspiratorially again. &#8220;This sword isn&#8217;t guarded much or in any way difficult to get to for someone of your capabilities.&#8221;<P>Nall wasn&#8217;t even paying attention. Twelve million platinum in BULLION? They could sell that for twice that much! They wouldn&#8217;t have to simply fix the airship, they&#8217;d upgrade it! The height of luxury...<P>The man&#8217;s nagging voice snapped Nall back to reality. He grinned impishly. &#8220;You got it. Arrange transport for us and we&#8217;ll get your stuff.&#8221;<P>&#8220;Oh, I almost forgot.&#8221; The man smiled, a predator&#8217;s smile. &#8220;The sword is dangerous. Watch yourselves.&#8221;<P>Reyas looked huffed. &#8220;Sure. A sword, dangerous to us? You insulting us?&#8221;<P>&#8220;Considering the boy&#8217;s performance in the arena, perhaps I should just go hire Aquamarine. After all.....&#8221;<P>Nall&#8217;s blood boiled. &#8220;Now you hold on a minute-&#8221; He prodded the man in the chest, razor-sharp claws coming within an inch of torso as they emerged from their hidden sheaths. &#8220;We are just fine, thank you. You tell us about this job, and we&#8217;ll damn well do it.&#8221;<P>&#8220;So we have a deal?&#8221;<P>&#8220;You betcha.&#8221; Nall smiled and shook hands with him, not trusting the shifty-looking eyes.<P>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>The man pulled out a cell phone as Nall and Reyas left. &#8220;Contact. I&#8217;ve arranged for them to pick up the item.&#8221;<P>&#8220;Good. Proceed and send a team of Ghosts to extract it and them-at gunpoint. The Director would rather not pay up.&#8221;<P>&#8220;How about Team Five? They&#8216;re full strength and equipped.&#8221;<P>&#8220;Five is already in Faydwer hunting Lunas and the girl. You&#8217;ll have to work with Six.&#8221;<P>&#8220;Why again? Six? They don&#8217;t even have full strength. And no support.&#8221;<P>&#8220;They&#8217;ll have to do. The Director has reason to believe that this will be more successful.&#8221;<P>&#8220;All right. Six will trail them. Five should rendezvous with Six after recovery. All subjects must be collected as soon as possible. I&#8216;ve placed a transmitter on the target.&#8221;<P>&#8220;What if they manage to evade the team? Or kill them?&#8221;<P>&#8220;Evade Ghosts? Come on. Be serious. As for killing them, I wouldn&#8216;t bet on it either. The teams should be able to defeat them without much trouble. Remember their genetic sources.&#8221;<P>Satisfied by his success, the agent of En-Gen lay back and sipped his drink. The key to owning someone was angering them, he decided. Once that had happened, you could make them do anything. The phones rang again.<P>&#8220;What?&#8221;<P>&#8220;Lillith is gone. We suspect breakout.&#8221;<P>&#8220;Damn!&#8221; The agent cursed wildly. &#8220;Wait. She has a transmitter implanted, correct?&#8221;<P>&#8220;Correct.&#8221;<P>&#8220;Well, track it. Keep her away from the targets at all costs.&#8221;<P>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>Dirk was brought out of dreams of the future by the sound of a footstep. He slowly, ever so carefully, withdrew the switchblade knife from his belt and flicked it open with a twist of the wrist. It had been an anniversary present long ago. Jesi had always been practical, it reminded him of her again, and it hurt to use it.<P>Again. The sound of booted feet. He slowly brought the knife into throwing position and with a mental command sealed the helmet.<P>(I&#8217;m up and ready. What&#8216;s on the menu?)<P>Can it, Starlight. I need infrared.<P>His vision turned greenish. Ahead, masked by shadows, a humanoid, living, male shape glowed bright green. It was carrying a rifle of some sort, probably automatic, pointed straight ahead. Seeing no friendly identity codes, and guessing from the man&#8216;s manner-and his natural instincts, Dirk threw the knife.<P>A sudden flash of green signified the heat bursting from the wound as the knife impacted at the man&#8216;s gut. The man cried out-and then started to rise again. Incredible. The knife was tungsten, and would go through most armor like paper. But Dirk had had enough. He brought the pistol up and caressed the trigger. A hail of death lanced out again and again and again. After four shots, the man crumpled without a sound.<P>(Nice armor.)<P>I noticed. <P>He leapt out of his seat and knelt down to the corpse. Checking for other enemies, and seeing no signs of life, he moved closer.<P>Lights please.<P>(Activated, oh mighty military genius.)<P>Can you stuff it?<P>He looked down and saw a familiar insignia. Reading it, he got up, and turned to walk away.<P>&#8220;En-Gen. But they don&#8216;t have troopers this tough....do they? What&#8216;s this? &#8216;Ghost&#8216;?&#8221;<P>A bullet whistled by his visor. Another shot out straight at him and bounced off his armor&#8217;s shields. As the neural chip on his forehead-the only one, so he could wear armor beneath as well- transmitted mental commands, the nozzle on his armor&#8217;s right forearm erupted in black energy as a black diamond once part of his original sword received a beam of energy and whirled around. Dirk pivoted, letting the prism blade sweep through the shadows. The supposedly dead man cried out again and fell to the ground, a bisected husk.<P>Dirk began to run. Fear for his daughter filled him and he sprinted for Trini&#8217;s room.<P>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>So do you trust this guy?<P>[Of course not. Anyone offering that much can&#8216;t be on the up and up.]<P>Wow, Grandpa. Your wits haven&#8217;t slipped after all. Amazing.<P>[Remember what I told you about respect?]<P>Respect is earned. And not by womanizing alone.<P>[No way! You don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re talking about, kid!]<P>Nall stared out the window at the frozen wastes of Selvatoria. The country ruled the upper north of the continent, and was rich in minerals but not in food and water  . The rapid euphoria of seeing so much money in one place was beginning to fade. He didn&#8217;t trust the crew, so he spoke telepathically.<P>Reyas punched Nall. &#8220;Ow!&#8221; <P>[So what are you planning to do with the sword?]<P>Sell it, of course. If he&#8217;s willing to pay twelve million in platinum bullion, then there are others who will pay more. We&#8217;ll be rich! Wealthy for the rest of our lives!<P>[Isn&#8217;t that a little amoral?]<P>You were the one who broke our ship. So keep quiet with the moralizing.<P>[I DID NOT BREAK IT! I was only walking on it and-]<P>Excuses, excuses. Nall turned and looked at his grandfather, then spoke aloud. &#8220;Looks like we&#8217;re there.&#8221;<P>The pilot spoke over then intercom. &#8220;Ok, boys, this is the general area. Signal us when you&#8217;re ready to go back. We&#8216;ll be watching for the flares.&#8221;<P>Nall picked up his weapons and left the compartment. He heard his grandfather follow. Seconds later, the massive Dropship lifted into the night sky.<P>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>Dirk ran like a bat out of hell, tearing through ruined corridors and only pausing to catch his breath. <P>(Stop, hold it!)<P>WHAT?<P>(Stealth. Five enemies ahead. MT is really high, and they&#8217;re armed and dangerous.)<P>Thanks.<P>(You&#8217;re too much like your dad for comfort.)<P>Dirk crept to the area around the doorway. As he raised his armor&#8217;s right arm, he aimed, directly for a head that seemed to leap out. Five men and women in hard suits were searching the room.<P>Dirk fired the automatic weapon in his right arm, turning the silence into a violent cacophony of sound. It took one man in the head. Screaming, the man hit the ground. The other four turned as one and flame licked the alcove.<P>Dirk pointed and screamed &#8220;Nocturne Beam!&#8221; A black beam, aided by the night already in the chamber, tore into a woman, who shrieked and grasped her chest. He whirled-and took a bullet to the side. His armor withstood the blow, but barely. He locked eyes with the man he had thought down.<P>No way......these guys are too tough.<P>Spent cartridges flying from the chamber, Dirk stabbed his arm&#8217;s machine gun out at the wounded man. There were blue ripples where the bullets impacted, but no damage, indicative of a mana shield amplifying the armor&#8217;s shield. <P>Dirk could play with those too. He activated his. As bullets bounced off his shield, he ignited his prism blade and slashed, killing his enemy without a sound. He whirled-and took a black beam in the shoulder. It sent tendrils of pain through his left side.<P>NO WAY. That&#8217;s biologically impossible...isn&#8217;t it?<P>(They don&#8217;t seem to think so.)<P>Dirk sprayed the room with bullets and rushed in, killing two before they could even draw their melee weapons by the most ensured way he could-beheading. The wounded woman and a young man drew reinforced adamantine weapons, the ultra-hard, ultra-light black metal shining, the man using a sword and supporting his wounded comrade, who was using a pair of katar.. Dirk rushed them with blade held high.<P>Prism blades operated through generating an energy field and focusing it through a prism. They were superior to laser blades because the minute fluctuations in the rotating prism caused the blade to constantly shift and be very difficult to guard against. However, adamantine lessened the damage by reflecting the light off in random directions. So the boy managed to parry-the girl wasn&#8217;t in any shape to fight. Dirk snarled and struck again, and again, and again, striking either blade, shield, or armor but doing no critical damage, before the boy thought he could risk a counterattack.<P>The kid&#8217;s attack was beautifully well struck-but futile. Dirk smiled behind his visor and countered with a ten-strike-in-quick-succession combo without losing a beat. Though armor shards flew, amazingly the boy was still standing.<P>Dirk&#8217;s face twisted into a bitter smile. He raised his right arm. &#8220;Night Blade.&#8221; A cone of darkness erupted from the floor and drilled into his opponents. The already wounded woman screamed and fell to the floor, her shield shorting out and her mind in agony from neural feedback. The kid yelled in pain but stood his ground, raising his own arm.<P>&#8220;Plasma Flare.&#8221;<P>Dirk yelled in pain inside his armor as flame blasted at him. His cooling system tried to keep up, and barely managed to do so.  He regarded his enemy coldly through the visor, breathing low and steady. The boy  was panting hard-but shut up abruptly as Dirk rushed in and backhanded the boy across the head, knocking him out.<P>Then another scream. &#8220;PA-PA!!!!&#8221;<P>Dirk&#8217;s blood turned to ice, his skin jet-black, and he ran for Trini&#8217;s room.<P>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>Nall looked around cautiously. &#8220;Unguarded my a--.&#8221; he said, and looked up again<P>Five men in the uniforms of Selvatorian troops stood guard over a strange-looking ruin in the barren, frozen wastes.<P>&#8220;Five. No trouble.&#8221; Reyas answered.<P>&#8220;That&#8217;s not the point. If he lied to us, we could be set up.&#8221; Nall cautiously aimed his rifle. &#8220;Here goes. Mana Wave!&#8221;<P>A wave of azure energy crossed the area between them and tore into a trooper, spinning him around and dropping him to the snow. as he rose again, a bullet from Nall&#8217;s railgun rifle broke the sound barrier and smashed into the enemy with all the grace and gentleness of a sledgehammer. The man dropped to the ground, his helmet a ruin of steel and plastic, and did not rise again.<P>The remaining four fired as one, the roar of their weapons shattering all semblance of peace. The bullets were fired at Reyas.<P>&#8220;Grandpa!&#8221;<P>Reyas pulled a blade of mana from nowhere and concentrated.  Nall heard a series of crackling noises and another Selvatorian fell dead as Reyas deflected the bullets with his blade. Nall whistled.<P>The remaining three did the only thing available to them. They charged, two of them tossing fireballs as they went.<P>Nall felt his skin and armor burn from the heat, but still managed to keep his aim. A round of shots and his attacker fell dead. Then they were within minimum range. Nall leapt to one side and clawed at another one. The claws went through the light steel breastplate easily and pierced the man beneath. As internal organs shredded, the man fell dead with a strangled scream.<P>The last man launched himself into a berserker-like charge, running straight past Nall and swiping at Reyas with the bayonet on his rifle. The two traded blows for a bit before Reyas ran his broadsword right through the middle of his assailant. The last man collapsed like a doll without strings.<P>&#8220;Nice work Grandpa. Guess you&#8217;re good for something besides womanizing after all.&#8221;<P>&#8220;Thanks-and I can still kick your butt, young whippersnapper.&#8221; Reyas pointed. &#8220;After you.&#8221;<P>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>Dirk ran into the room where Trini slept. He stopped immediately.<P>&#8220;Don&#8217;t move, Lunas.&#8221; A group of three, heavily armor-clad &#8216;Ghosts&#8217; were aiming various nasty weapons at him. One held Trini.<P>&#8220;Daddy! Let me go!&#8221; She screamed and kicked at her assailant.<P>&#8220;You heard her. Let her go,&#8221; Dirk said, his voice at a dangerously quiet level.<P>&#8220;And if I don&#8217;t?&#8221; the leader asked with a smirk as he raised his visor. His face was menacing, tough, hard. Brown skin, dark hair. A pair of deep-set green eyes.<P>&#8220;You&#8217;ll contract a bad case of &#8216;dead&#8217;. That bad enough?&#8221;<P>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to back that up, you know. Surrender now and I promise you neither her or you shall be harmed.&#8221;<P>&#8220;I know what En-Gen wants me for. No thanks.&#8221; Dirk brought his weapons up.<P>&#8220;Your loss. Sergeant, Private, take the kid and go.&#8221; The leader spread his arms and brought his armor&#8217;s rocket launcher up over his shoulder. Dirk aimed his gun at the two, but one of them held up Trini as a human shield and prodded her with his pistol.<P>&#8220;Daddy!&#8221; she screamed.<P>&#8220;I can&#8217;t....Trini!&#8221;<P>Damnit! Dirk let the weapon down and the two vanished out the doorway to the balcony. He heard the rush of their jump jets.<P>The next thing he heard was the dreaded tone and screaming of &#8220;MISSILE LOCK!&#8221; He leapt to the right as the enemy man fired, fire jetting out the back of the launcher. The missile lanced to the side and literally blew the roof off. Dirk leapt forward and brought his prism blade to life, slashing down.<P>It impacted another prism blade, a bright orange one which stained the room with argent light. As energy blade struck energy blade, his own flashed white and sucked the light from the room. Dirk felt the impact of a dozen bullets as a machine gun licked his armor. His screen recorded 5% armor reduction.<P>Dirk yelled and his body was coated in supernatural fire so hot that it literally sucked in everything, including light particles, black as night. He flipped backwards, bringing an armored boot into his assailant&#8217;s gut. The man gave no ground, but countered with a brilliant streak of argent flame. Dirk ignited his jumpjets and leapt into the sky as his foe did likewise.<P>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>Nall placed his boot ever so cautiously on the stone beneath him. Nothing happened, so he relaxed and placed the other one on it.<P>Immediately alarms started to blare. Nall cursed wildly and Reyas looked around as troops clad in riot armor and carrying bullet shields stepped out. There was the ****ing of twenty automatic rifles.<P>&#8220;Drop your weapons and stand down.&#8221; The leader spoke through his filtered gas mask. The metallic tone of the voice was odd.<P>In response Nall simply grinned and struck the ground beneath him. &#8220;Catastrophe!&#8221; he cried. The ground exploded in fire and many of the troops were knocked onto their backs. Nall pulled out his railgun and started firing wildly as return fire blasted over his head. He ducked behind a pillar and reloaded. There was no sign of Reyas.<P>&#8220;Grandpa?&#8221; he yelled as he swung around and drilled a man with a murderous volley.<P>&#8220;I&#8217;m fine!&#8221; Reyas pulled out his mana broadsword and struck three quick blows across one man&#8217;s torso. The man responded by bludgeoning Reyas in the gut, but the dragon wasn&#8217;t affected at all. He raised one hand and energy was collected into a sphere in his palm. Reyas clenched his fist and screamed &#8220;Graviton Beam!&#8221;<P>The energy exploded outward in a lance of death. Reyas pivoted, slashing through support pillars and men, til the beam exhausted itself. The crushed remains of Reyas&#8217;s opponent collapsed in a heap of blackened, melted metal and melted plastics.<P>&#8220;Nall!&#8221; Reyas yelled. &#8216;They&#8217;re machines! They&#8217;re not human!&#8221;<P>&#8220;Geez, thanks for letting me know.&#8221; Nall slammed another clip into his rifle. &#8220;I&#8217;m running outta bullets here!&#8221; He fired again, creasing another assailant&#8217;s body with thousands of  pits and holes. The thing stopped moving after a full round. Not able to take the time to reload, Nall dropped the railgun and leapt at his enemies, claws ripping apart steel torsos and bodies with merciless efficiency.<P>Reyas spun and drove his blade into the floor. Tremors shuddered through the building and the last remnants of the enemy force collapsed.<P>&#8220;You could have done that earlier.&#8221;<P>&#8220;You were doing all right. Is the young, spry, fit man tired?&#8221; Reyas laughed.<P>&#8220;Quit goofing around, grandpa.&#8221; Nall pulled a fresh packet of clips from his backpack. &#8220;Let&#8217;s go.&#8221;<P>The next room was a simple, well-furnished office. There was no surveillance and no traps. On the desk was a gold-plated case.<P>&#8220;This seems to have been a covert Selvatorian base, grandpa. I don&#8217;t like this-but as long as there are no witnesses, we&#8217;ll get away with it. Selvatoria always bugged me anyways.&#8221;<P>&#8220;Careful, Nall.&#8221;<P>Nall opened the case. A long, ornate platinum-and-silver long sword lay inside, the blade festooned with lots and lots of small gemstones. He picked it up. It seemed to radiate power, and he grinned.<P>Then a voice spoke right inside his head.<P>/I don&#8217;t recognize you. Who are you?\<P>&#8220;Ahh!&#8221;<P>The door slammed open and he heard a familiar voice.<P>&#8220;Drop the sword, cutie.&#8221; He spun around and looked down the barrel of Aquamarine&#8217;s particle cannon.<P>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>Dirk spun around in midair and boosted the power to his jumpjets. He drove the blade at his foe with hatred surging in his blood. It was parried, then the enemy man snapped his fingers and cried out &#8220;Flare.&#8221;<P>Dirk&#8217;s armor was suddenly engulfed in bright red flames of which the concussion nearly snuffed his own black flame barrier. He cursed and raised his arm. &#8220;Lucent Beam.&#8221; A bright blade of light crossed the air between them and lanced deep into armor.<P>Back and forth the duel raged. Dirk had found a worthy opponent, and though the scream of weapons and magic was thick in the air, neither could penetrate the other&#8217;s defenses. They ripped through the air, and Dirk locked weapons with his adversary and grinned as his other hand glowed with black fire.<P>(Watch your six!)<P>Then he knew the horror of freefall as...something blasted him in each side and he fell.<P>It was five hundred feet to the ground. He impacted with a hideous crunch of shattering metal and equipment, felt a shard of torn armor dig into his back-and screamed. He stared through his suddenly cracked visor and saw a reddish stain on and near the crack. He looked to his side and saw his jumpjets were shot. He looked up to see two enemies about him and cursed in one of the lower languages of Hell.<P>&#8220;Nice timing, Rashan.&#8221; Dirk&#8217;s original foe commented. &#8220;It was starting to get a little iffy.&#8221;<P>&#8220;Next time, do not depend on our arrival.&#8221; said the figure with a two-horned mask, in a male and female voice. Dirk shuddered and started to rise.<P>&#8220;I&#8217;m not finished yet!&#8221; he yelled. The figure laughed and sent a glowing orb of energy at him. Dirk whipped out the modified prism blade and parried the ball, sending it back. &#8220;I&#8217;d rather not keep your little gift!&#8221;<P>The figure caught the orb in a gauntleted hand and smashed it, then laughed. &#8220;....Small wonder. You&#8217;re too weak to be worth anything.&#8221; it said in it&#8217;s female voice.<P>Dirk&#8217;s eyes and skin turned black as he gave in to his darker side. He raised his arm and screamed &#8220;Mar&#8217;ak, nealk veelth!&#8221; and ran at the figure, hatred surging in his veins and all moral values dead. His strike was barely parried, then something hit him and he slammed into the rock. He heard metal tear and then started to black out.<P>&#8220;What will we do with him?&#8221; he heard weakly.<P>&#8220;Leave him.&#8221;<P>&#8220;But my orders were to kill him after extracting a sample-&#8221;<P>&#8220;We said leave him. If you want to kill him, go ahead and try.&#8221;<P>The man descended to the earth and got close to Dirk. Through reddened eyes, Dirk saw the hazy form of the man get closer.<P>&#8220;It&#8217;s over for you...&#8221; and the man aimed.<P>Then he screamed in pain as Dirk&#8217;s left hand went straight through armor as if it were a shadow and clenched in the area of his heart. The blood left the man&#8217;s face. He writhed and struck weak blows on Dirk&#8217;s helmet, which did absolutely no good.<P>&#8220;I...don&#8217;t think...so.&#8221; Dirk gasped. &#8220;Never...underestimate...a demon...even a half-breed.&#8221; With no regrets, Dirk clenched his fist and felt something-something rather important- tear. Then he let go. &#8220;If you hurry....you might live....&#8221;<P>Already screaming and breathing hard, the man rocketed into the sky. Dirk stopped fighting the darkness, and fell unconscious.<P>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>Nall backed away. &#8220;Oh no, it&#8217;s AquaPurine!&#8221; he taunted.<P>&#8220;MARINE! AQUAMARINE!!!&#8221; she screamed, and fired the particle cannon. It missed Nall narrowly and blasted into a wall. He winced and backed up another foot. Recovering her composure, she re-aimed it and repeated her order. &#8220;Drop the sword.&#8221;<P>&#8220;You think I&#8217;m crazy? You ripped me off before, you&#8217;re not doing it again.&#8221; Nall aimed and fired as she raised her own weapon.<P>The sound of both warriors opening the gates of Hell to one another was tremendous. Nall saw only a hazy, bluish glow as the particle cannon bestowed it&#8217;s teasing, crushing caress on his body. He felt pain. Only pain. He dimly heard Aquamarine&#8217;s screams, of fury, not of pain, then he saw again and she wasn&#8217;t in front. <P>No WAY do you get behind me! He spun like a top and grabbed the sword from the table. With a curse he swung for her shoulder, knocking the particle cannon to the ground. As she cursed wildly and struck with her fist, he continued his spin, deflecting most of the blow. It still closed his jaw abruptly and made his teeth ache. She fired something at him and he felt himself be propelled by the impact. He slammed into a wall with a crunch.<P>....Where the hell are you, Grandpa?<P>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>When he came to, he may have been screaming. He didn&#8217;t know. He couldn&#8217;t see out of one eye. Did I lose it? he wondered.<P>[There&#8217;s blood covering it.]<P>His hand couldn&#8217;t reach inside the helmet. He did the best he could and sent a subliminal command to his computer to blow some air inside his helm. The blood slowly was washed away by the jets of air-most of it, He stared at the bloody crack in his visor with a numbed brain and felt the clotting blood on his cheek.<P>[You ok? You&#8216;ve cut your cheek to the bone, Dirk. It isn&#8216;t serious but you&#8216;re in shock.]<P>I think so........He tried to get up and felt the fire of the barely staunched wound on his back. Then again....<P>[The emergency medical supplies are exhausted. You&#8217;re gonna have to make do. Are you still any good at healing?]<P>&#8220;Yeah...&#8220; he whispered and felt the cool blue light infusing his wounds.<P>[You took one hell of a beating, Dirk. I&#8217;ve never seen that happen before.]<P>&#8220;I suppose that guy was really, really good.&#8221; he said aloud. The screaming fire of his wounds was only barely cushioned. &#8220;Starlight, did you hear me? I feel like I&#8217;ve been screaming.&#8221;<P>[You were.]<P>&#8220;.......What?&#8221;<P>[You were talking to someone in your dreams. It sounded like.....you were talking to Jesi.]<P>A chill washed over Dirk, but he got weakly to his feet.  &#8220;Well this is a fix, eh? No jumpjets, no transport, and no shelter. Any ideas?&#8221;<P>[There has to be some transports left behind. It looked like it was a team of twenty men, and you put down six. A standard light transport-the only kind they could have gotten over here because of the no-fly zones- holds four to six people and a bedroom to sleep in.]<P>&#8220;I can&#8217;t fly one. The last flying course I took was about five years old.&#8221; Dirk answered as he picked his way over the broken rocks towards the ruined temple. &#8220;And what happens if they linked the controls? Anyways, why do you think that they packed their troopers comfortably?&#8221;<P>[We&#8217;ll make do. Even if they had packed them like sardines, think about it. Ammunition. Armor. Food.. Probably some genetic equipment. I&#8217;m willing to bet we&#8217;ll have a spare. ]<P>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you unstoppable.&#8221; He laughed. It was good to have at least one person rooting for him. &#8220;You do know these healing spells are a temporary thing, right? It&#8217;s basically jury-rigging.&#8221;<P>[Yes. You should be ok, though. As long as the transport holds medical supplies, that is.]<P>The sunlight filled the ruined structure as Dirk walked down the halls, searching for the room and it&#8217;s two unconscious occupants. Memories, happy ones, mocked his pain. The feeling of light-headedness began to grow as he lost more blood, leaving slightly reddened footsteps occasionally. He would pause about every five minutes to reseal the wounds and preserve blood.<P>[The spot where you left the two was around here.]<P>&#8220;I know.&#8221; Dirk pointed his weapon straight ahead, and as he strode forward he saw two tumbled forms.<P>&#8220;Wake up.&#8221; he said quietly, and tapped the kid&#8217;s helmet.<P>The sound of the pistol being pulled out and aimed at Dirk&#8217;s cracked visor was the rasp of metal on leather. Dirk stared down the muzzle of it, then as the kid fired he grinned as the bullet bounced off the shield he had prudently put up first and clattered to the floor with a ringing like silvery bells.<P>Dirk struck the pistol out of his captive&#8217;s hands. Captive, because both of them knew who was in charge. The woman stirred-then leapt up with weapon out, dropping it down as the kid quietly urged her.<P>&#8220;You&#8217;re taking me to your transport, and then where I say. Do as I say and you won&#8217;t be killed, and we may actually come to a more firm, profitable partnership in the future.&#8221;<P>&#8220;And if we refuse?&#8221; the young man asked. Dirk grinned like the Grim Reaper.<P>&#8220;I&#8217;ll kill you and steal your transport anyways. What&#8217;s inconvenient for me is fatal for you. Choose.&#8221;<P>The man&#8217;s shoulders slumped in defeat, and he removed his helmet. The woman did likewise and Dirk, as a sign of respect, removed his.<P>The young man was tall and fair of face. He was blond, slightly reddish, haired, and had a firm, honest face that spoke of a sense of honor and a thoughtful nature. His slightly pointed ears spoke of elven blood, and he had a thin, wiry build. He looked very out-of-place in heavy armor and carrying an adamantine broadsword. He didn&#8217;t look terribly strong, but he was very, very fast.  His blue eyes were piercing, a lot like those of a bird of prey.<P>The woman, on the other hand, was dusky skinned, like desert sand at sundown, and possessed a smoldering beauty, dark haired and fine-boned, the sort that challenged a man as well as tempting him.  Her eyes were dark and deep, her face was classically beautiful, and her figure was quite nice. Her build was deceptively slight, but from a second&#8217;s study Dirk knew hers was a strength that showed itself only when needed, much like his own. She looked at him with barely held contempt and hatred, while the boy looked more curious and nervous then angry. Her features were that of an erudite/human crossbreed, a rare combination indeed.<P>&#8220;What&#8217;s your names?&#8221; Dirk asked quietly.<P>&#8220;Privates second class Eris and Scott.&#8221; the young man answered, pointing to his comrade first and then himself.<P>&#8220;All right, Eris, Scott. Take me to your transport, then set up it&#8217;s route for wherever you were intending to take me.&#8221; Dirk smiled grimly. &#8220;I need to have a few....words with your boss.&#8221;<P>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>Nall fired another bolt even as he clenched his fist. &#8220;Mana Wave!&#8221;  The blast of energy left Aquamarine feeling numb and her other projectile weapon in shambles. She threw the ruined thing aside and glowed bright white for a second.<P>&#8220;Nanoflare!&#8221; She hurled a ball of white-hot flame at Nall, who managed to dodge and counter with a strike from his sword. She gripped the blade. &#8220;LET GO!&#8221; she cried.<P>&#8220;Fat chance!&#8221; He pulled back.<P>&#8220;Easy there, boy! We&#8216;ve just met!&#8221; Nall distinctly heard the female voice. Combat stopped abruptly.<P>&#8220;Did you say that?&#8221; he asked, looking at Aquamarine.<P>She shook her head.<P>&#8220;Down here.&#8221; Nall looked down and saw only the jeweled sword.<P>&#8220;Where?&#8221;<P>&#8220;Are you always this thick?&#8221; The sword was talking! Aquamarine snickered, but Nall flushed.<P>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;<P>&#8220;Name&#8217;s Atwight. I-&#8221;<P>A sudden flash interrupted the sword&#8217;s words, and the next thing he knew Nall was struggling as a man grabbed him from behind and held a wet rag smelling of chemicals to his mouth. His vision grew dim, and he only barely heard Aquamarine&#8217;s screams of protest as she was knocked out, and sank down into a welcome darkness.<P>--------------------<P><I>Cowards die many times before their deaths.

I thought I might as well add something with more background info. I can't help but write.------------------------------------------------------------<BR>En-Gen Biological Data File. Code Blue Eyes Only<BR>------------------------------------------------------------<P>URGENT MESSAGE<P>Datafile:<P>Subject: &#8216;Demon&#8217; Race<BR>En-Gen Filer: D. N. Athra<P><BR>Sir,<P>I have been pouring through old records since you have announced to me the target Dirk Lunas. I believe I have discovered the second side of his racial and genetic strands as a result. This information is based on intuition and research, it is not completed.<P>Dirk&#8217;s blood is high in MTA of an unknown type. This type has only previously been found in Dragons and other mana-heavy creatures. I have tried to identify this particular strand and met with a great deal of success.<P>Apparently, this particular match belongs to a species called &#8216;Demons&#8217;. No doubt based on myth and theology, these creatures are more often then not pure evil and inhabit the mythical lower &#8216;plane&#8217; of Hell. This is supposedly where evil people come to meet their eternal torture. How this strand exists on Norrath is not known, as no Demon has even been sighted in over five hundred years. According to legend, they ceased coming here after the death of their greatest chieftain, Calchisith. How these beings exists in Norrath is a particularly vexing mystery I have yet to solve.<P>Dirk&#8217;s particular match belongs to a genetic strand I have chosen to term from old records. Succubae (or in his case, as he is male, Incubae.) It is high in an unknown genetic code that seems highly fluid to susceptible changes, almost as if the creature can consciously alter it&#8217;s shape and evolution. A smaller amount of a second strand, (named also from old records, no doubt exaggerated, as the combat ability is beyond belief) Reaper, is that of a creature supposedly a living killing machine, able to attack using all four limbs and with incredible natural talent. This &#8216;Shadow&#8217; magic he is reputed to wield is a biological ability involving the manipulation of shadow and light to solid coherence. Thus, it is highly rare among normal humans or demihumans, and the feeble results we have gained (the weak utilization of a few weak techniques) in our C521 and A523 strand testing are to be expected.<P>However, this strand (which I am codenaming D) seems to present an interesting opportunity. As Dirk&#8217;s strands give basic mastery of the D strand, his capture and sample extraction could very well lead to our ability to breed many kinds of Demons. As these creatures are intelligent, they may present some initial difficulty, but I have no doubt we could use them as guards and exterminators. As deadly and vicious combat are embedded in the very genetic code of these creatures, as well as occasional sadism, they would be highly easy to train.<P>In conclusion, I warn the Director that this subject will be highly difficult and dangerous to snare. Capture and analysis is paramount. If successful capture is reached, we can utilize it for many uses. I would recommend inserting this strand into our current Teams 5 and 6. Though the process of mutation would be painful and trauma-filled for the subjects, that is of no real concern to the Director. If that experiment is successful, we can move on to more advanced tests. Also I must remind the Director that possession of Lunas as well as his daughter is critical. His daughter&#8217;s blood carries little to no D strand more then a normal human&#8217;s and as a result is not suitable for extraction.<P>End File<BR>------------------------------------------<P>--------------------<P><I>Cowards die many times before their deaths. The valiant only taste of death but once.</I><P>-William Shakespeare, <I>Julius Ceasar</I>

(Because I am evil and a slow typist. here is part 1 of a CH.3. The rest will be coming...sometime  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"> )<P>---------------------<BR>Chapter 3 Neoteny<BR>---------------------<P><BR>Lilith's world slowly went from pure distortion to complete visibility as she exited the Azure portal. The ancient scrolls the tortured voice in her mind led her to showed her how easy it was to open a dimension gate ..well at least for any one of some intelligence and skill.<P>She was...disappointed..yes thatr seemed to be the right word. The plane of sky was dying. The once flying islands had begun to fall apart , their orbits decaying . Which was distressing, that only happens if the creator was either destroyed or had been gone for a long period of time in Norrathian figuring. Time means nothing in the alter planes.<P>It meant that Veeshan was no longer here, her task of finding the keys to free the voice was now made that much harder. it angered her..that voice would be in her mind so much longer...if she had gained full control of the corporeal bind yet she would have broken into tears at the thought..but to her benefit she had neglected that aspect of biology.<P>She sighed and then turned around preparing to reopen the Azure gate back to Norrath to continue her search for the Luclin keys, but something caught her eye. An island which was about to collapse in on itself from it's decaying orbit began to perk up, it's eternal fall beginning to stabilize....She was near.<P>Two voices spoke from behind her, a man and woman speaking as one.<P>"So you are En-gen's pride. Hmm..Interesting. A combinate being formed from the strongest of Norrath." The voice slowly began to change purifying to just the woman's voice. "Interesting that they would limit you to a Teir'dal form..you could have been anything..but no matter. Why have you come to my realm?"<P>The hairs on the back of Lilith's neck were standing on end from the energy radiating from the being behind her. She turned around and brushing the rogue strands of bluish-black hair that was agitated by the stirring wind, from the front of her face.<P>"Luclin key....now...or..else..." She said as forcibly as her limited knowledge of language.<P>The winged crystalline women laughed. "Or else what? What makes you think I will give you the key to free Void? Foolish puppet, your lack of knowledge and your recent birth prohibits you from being free of the Void's sway. For that you will be forgiven, if you stop this silliness and return to stasis."<P>"Not...As..uah....." Lilith scowled, it infuriated her not being able to voice her ideas. She needed more experience. this body was limiting her mind. She gave up on speaking and entered the woman's mind.<P>I will never return to En-Gen! I shall be free. I will release the voice, get it out of my head. It hurts me!! I want it out!! Now!!! FREE!!! I WANT FREEDOM!!! I will be free, to love like all things..to find<P>As she conveyed her message to the women and image of Nall in his battle in SNG flashed across. As she conveyed it, she felt a feeling of warmth and giddiness pass through her once again.<P>{You are not ready to be free child, you are still newborn and do not yet understand the world. The pain and torment you feel now is nothing compared to what Void will unleash. I will not give you my key. }<P>Lilith felt flushed with heat...this was anger..yes anger Pure powerful anger!!! It was so much that she lost her ability to enter the woman's mind.<P>"Give.sdf .NOW!!!! Me .....abi pain!!!! want...ac ad ..happy!!.......boy.fascc..love!!!!!!!!!"<P>"You see child, if you can not control you anger,or even something as simple as telepathy. You are most certainly not ready to take youplace in this world. Go back to En-Gen rest, gain control of your body. Your mind is strong, just give time to let the rest of you catched up." The woman...Veeshan, is what the voice called her, smiled warmly<P>"Voice....hurt......sad..ahaggg.....say....bkayyou is bad...YOu.....are....evil....will...ton..lis...ten..Veecahn!"<P>You are also easilty pursauded, but you are a fast learner. Child I do not wish to fight you. Please return to En-Gen and focus. I do not wish to force you"<P>"I...Lilith...Can...nboiaoe beten!!!"<P>Veeshan sighed, then stepped backwards fading out of sight<P>Lilith leaped into the air, searching for Veeshan and found her the hard way. A metal fist slammed into her side, the air left her lungs. Another blow upon her back caused the light from her world fade to nothing.<P>As the quickly battered form of Lilith crashed to the island below. A male voice bgan to speak from the figure donned in a two-horned mask of crystal.<P>"Did you have to treat her so badly? She is only a few hours old."<P>"I did what I had to do, you know that better then any one."<P>"Yes...but still..I guess I am becoming soft in my old age. Especially since she is getting hot in the seat for my great-grandson. He is getting popular. Sounds famaliar."<P>"You wish. Let's take her back to En-Gen. She needs to rest and recover. She must acquire more knowledge. Then she would not be so vulnerable to the Void's sway."<P>"I believed it."<P>"Well we never said intelligence was your brightest area."<P>"Hmph. regardless I don't trust En-Gen."<P>"Neither do I. but for right now helping them is the only way to ensure Void's demise."<P>"What an oxy moron..destroying nothing.."<P>The two voices began to speak in unison once again<P>"But none the less it shall be achieved. For it is the purpose of our union."<BR>--------------------------------------<P>As the mixed trio headed down the large ButcherBlock mountain, Dirk begins an impromptu interrogation of his two captured 'Ghosts'.<P>"Why is En-Gen so interested in me? Why did they spend an obvious fortune in sending you 'Ghosts' here?"<P><BR>The girl as she had since her capture, remained silent, a curous mixed air of absolute defiance and subservience surrounding her. The boy Scott responded in a crisp rising tone of speech, like what would be expect of a Private to an officer.<P>"You were a secondary target sir, not a priority. Our orders where to obtain a blood sample and then liquidate you if possible but not risk jeopardizing the primary goal. Which was the mongr-"<P>Dirk whirled around immediately grasping the boy by the collar of his hard suit, Dirk's eyes promising a slow death.<P>"-...Combinate child. She was the Priority. Level one. Everything including the squad was secondary, expendable."<P>"Why?"<P>"I can't say."<P>"Can't or won't?"<P>"Can't."<P>" And why are you being so forthright with all of this information?"<P>"Policy."<P>"Policy? To give up all the information with out even a little protest?"<P>"Yes. The Iron-man routine popularized in stereo casts is useless in real life. You should know that considering your old-"<P>Dirk tightened his grip on the boy's armor.<P>"many years experience. En-Gen policy if we are captured sing. It is why we are never provided with any information not necessary to the mission."<P>"and you just go out like that? Willing to die for no good reason?"<P>"It is what we were trained for."<P>Glancing momentarily glancing over at the girl Eris "Doesn't she ever say anything?"<P>"I outrank her. In situations of capture or at anytime during a mission a  Ghost of lower rank will never speak unless spoken too."<P>"Sigh..military.." Dirk let go of the boy and continued on down the mountain to the transport carrier. For another few hours they continued not speaking , eventually arriving the moderately sized Transport, a 'Jumpboat' class of craft.<P>As Dirk fumbled with the outside lock to the Jumpboat, he heard a few groans of pain. He payed it only a little mind, figuring that it the undead where on the march again, a small problem, but none the less he did not want to deal with them now. Not until he could get some medical attention. As the boat's rear door began to creep open, he felt a hand on his shoulder. He turned around and found himself facing a 9 foot creature, parts of a ripped hardsuit was on it. High on it's chest was the famous En-Gen label and a badge. "Eris'<P>|DIRK!!!| Starlight screamed<P>"What in the-"<P>The creature let loose a deafening roar and hoisted the surprised Dirk above it's head and like a Javelin threw Dirk up the mountain.<BR>----------------------------------<P>A door chimes.<P>"Enter." The Overseer turns his chair around toward the door as an excited gnome enters carrying a DAP.<P>"Shamus, you seem in a excited state. What's up?"<P>"Several things sir. Glorious things really"<P>"Do to tell"<P>"Our  Ghost team dispatched to Selvatoria and Faydwer were succesful sir. More then, though they did suffer heavier losses then expected."<P>"Hmm. Break it down."<P>"Our Selvatorian team capured the blade for Lilith and acquired the boy. From what we have extracted at the moment via Hypno. His name is Nall Tayus, and like we predicted he is in fact 1 quarter dragon. I'll have further details in my report later. Also in the raid we acquired the SNG champion Aquamarine, who has also been moonlighting as a treasure hunter and superhero. But more importantly she can be ransomed later on for further project funds. Her family is quite wealthy, Almost as rich as En-gen."<P>"Hmph. I fid that hard to belive, but continue. What about the ancestor?"<P>"Unfortunately the ancestor escaped our grasp. It was far stronger then those 1'2t generation Ghost's. Maybe if we had authorized the use of the Neoteny formula...but that's speculation. Regardless, it escaped momentarily and was subsequently buried whenn we blasted the site via the Stratokracker."<P>"Stratokracker? I thought we agreed on Mana Cannon?"<P>"....It doesn't really matter. San-Green., Mana Cannon, Stratokracker..the name is isn't imporatant..though I prefer Final Heavan myself.."<P>"Hehe..What of Lilith?"<P>"Captured by Rashan and brought to the Gunboat Diplomat. Also the the boy and Aquamarine have been placed onboard the Diplomat.Sir..Permission to getr off subject?"<P>" Of course, no need to be so formal Shamus."<P>"I don't trust Rashan. I think it is a grave mistake to put so much trust in him...her...whatever the hell Rashan is."<P>"Rashan won't be much of a concern once we complete Lilith. Rashan will be her first assignment, trial by fire."<P>"If Lilith could beat Rashan, there will be no stopping us. Rashan is quite duanting."<P>"Yes. Well anyway, what of the dispatch to Faydwer?"<P>"Just barely above a disaster. Majority of the team was killed, only the commander escaped though by help of Rashan again. Though we are still getting readings from two other Ghost's, they may be being held for interrogation. We can't tell their Hard suits have been heavily damaged. But that is not the major points sir. 1. We acquired a sample of Dirk Lunas and it is currently being integrated into Lilith as we speak. 2. We acquired the child and are running a complete work up on her in our Deep six station underneath Timorous. But what we have gotten with just prelim's is unbelievable."<P>"What?"<P>"We determined her father."<P>"Who?"<P>"Dirk AND Maxim"<P>"WHAT !?! That's impossible!"<P>"Yes as unbelievable as it sounds. Both Maxim and Dirk are the chld's father. We have no idea how this happened, but she has a profile matching the mother, Dirk and Maxim. This is just incredible. Even at her young age, she is already exhibiting fantastic powers, at this moment her potential MT level already matches Lilith. This more then explains the Dread King's interest in her, by the gods, if he hadn't extracted her and that barrier failed. I hate to think about it." <P>"A small child like that, born of woman matching the collective work of years and of research..unbelievable. I trust you are integrating her profile in Lilith?"<P>"Of course!"<P>"Speaking of the child what of the father..er one of the fathers. Dirk?"<P>"Unfortunately he is still alive though heavily injured. At the moment we suspect, he is interrogating the remaining Ghosts. Should we explode their hearts sir?"<P>"What? No don't be silly. They may be 1st generation, but they are still valuable..for now. Lets keep our 40 million platinum investments. "<P>The Overseer opens a panel on his table and depresses a button.<P>|Stratospheric monitoring online Overseer|<P>"Switch to <I>Final Heavan</I>.."He smiles at Shamus" Camera 3b and display"<P>A holographic image of an Arial view of Faydwer, floats in the air at head level of the Overseer. <P>"Target Ghost Units in area and Lock on"<P>|Acquiring......Target Lock...Fire Final Heavan?|<P>"No."<P>|Final Heavan powering down from Stratospheric strike readiness. What is your order Overseer?|<P>"Activate Neoteny. Code Overseer Alpha One"<P>|Code accepted.. Neoteny Genetic Transmutation Activated. Do you wish to magnify and enhance view Overseer?|<P>"No. You've seen one bloodbath, you've seen another. Display off."<P>"Hmph. Bloodbath is a polite way of putting it. Sir, why did you want Lilith to be transported on the Qeynos flagship? It is rather slow."<P>"I know, but our recent actions have been picking up a lot of negative media and public attention. Especially when we use our own resources, who ever thought of the the public's <I>right</I> to know, needs to be dragged out into the steet and shot."<P>"Which street?"<P>"oo..I dunno.. how about all of them?"<P>As the two continued to discuss other matters, far away on the undead continent of Faydwer. The two Ghost's, Eris and Scott, began to cry out in pain, as their bodies began to rip and tear. Muscles and sinew shredded, rgrew and swelled. No longer where they pinnacles of stealth and covert operations. They where monsters demons almost..designed for one thing and one thing only. To destroy everything in their path.<BR>---------------------------------------<P>Blackness then stars... everything was spinning around..<P>"Where are am I?" Dirk mumbled<P>|I suggest you get up and fast you have two big uglies coming toward you| Starlight suggested<P>"Who are ...you? Star..li?" Two heavy thuds sounded behind him. Dirk groggily rotated around to face to large demonic creatures. Standing 9 feet tall and rippling muscle adorned in mangled metal/ceramic armor. They stared directly into his eyes and roared so lud that the ground quaked.<P>"Oh shi-"<P>One of them piced him up like a doll and began to slam him up and down against the jagged rock, inflicting more wounds on the battered Black Elf. After a baker's dozen of slams the creature hoisted him up so they where face to face. It opened it's great maw and  roared once again as millions of volts of electricity coursed through. As much as it hurt Dirk did not cry out, unknown if it was for bracery or for inabilty from the amount current flowing through. Soon the beast let up, Dirk hung limp. It roared was again and  let his body drop to the dirt. The beast growled once and then with the other prepared to head down the mountain. It crouched down to make a leap but just as it tensed a fist smashed into it's spine shattering it.  Before the beast could howl two hands wrapped around it's mouth and face and yanked down and backwards right into a hard knee, knocking the beast out.<P>The other was somewhat surprised from the swiftness and power of Dirk's return assualt, the moments hesitation was more then enough for Dirk. In then that brief moment, mana gathered within Dirk's body.<P>"Nocturne Beam!" The beam of darkness struck the best in the chest, melting the chest plate and catapulting the beast of the cliff.<P>"Man...I need a vacation.."<P>|Well no rest for you yet Dirk. We still have to find Trini.|<P>The reminder of Trini,, momentarily eased his wounds and salved his numerous burns.<P>"Yes.But where to start?"<P>|I'm sure that the transport has a course already in the auto pilot. It may be a good place to start.|<P>"Yes.."<P>Picking him self of the cold rock, he slowly limped down the mountain to the Jumpboat. His resolve unwavering but his wounds soon began to take it's toll and even  Dirk's might couldn&#8217;t keep up forever. Luckily the craft was in reach, he stumbled inside and as he began to black out, he thumbed the autopilot.<P>|Rest well, Dirk|<BR>--------------------------------<P>Nall slowly opened his eyes,  he could stil the chloroform. <P>"Yech.."<P>"Yeah. I know you would have thought the could have given me a decent shirt to wear."<P>That voice seemed familiar...it wasn't..it couldn't be.. he opened his eyes and looked up...it was<P>"Aquamarine!?!"<P>He stared at the human girl in the ragged dirty oily shirt and mechanics pants.<P>"Yes. Looks like we are stuck together."<P>"Great. I lose all my money, find a way to make some, you interfere, again! And no I have been capture by the gods only know and I am once again with you!"<P>"Seems like you have a crush."<P>"Wha.AJ I..YOu.." Nal stammered in a flustered state<P>Aquamarine giggled as Nall's face began to match the red strip of hair above his brow.<P>"Hehe. Look for what it's worth, I'm sorry about what happened on SNG."<P>"And what about now?"<P>"Oh, this your fault"<P>"My fault! None of this would have happened if you hadn't butted in!"<P>" Doesn't matter now"   "...even though it is your fault" she mumbles<P>"Huh?"<P>"Nothing. So what is your name? YOur real name I mean unless you like being called Kid Draco?"<P>"No most definitely not. Nall."<P>"Annie..my real name is Anita but I prefer Annie. I wonder what they want from us on a Battle cruiser?"<P>"Battle cruiser?"<P>"Yeah, we are on the Qeynoes Royal Battle cruiser <I>Gunboat Diplomat</I>. The largest and most powerful sea-based craft on Norrath."<P>"I thought the Palsian 'cruiser <I>Limiting Factor</I> was the most powerful ship?"<P>Annie fumed and turn red, angry red not the embarrassed red Nall was. "IT IS NOT!! MY DA-..I mean the Diplomat is biggest most powerful ship on Norrath."<P>"Whatever. It's just another sailboat"<P>Annie grew even redder, Nall oblivious to her rising anger sighed loudly lamenting about his still broken Airship.<P>"I don't think you know of any way to get out of here do you?"<P>"No..well. there is one way but we don't have blow torch."<P>"What? melt the hinges of the door?"<P>"No, thats reinforced Quatain, straight from the deepest Selvatorian mines. JUst like my suit....That stuff is hard is damage."<P>"Then what?"<P><BR>"See the air shaft above me? "<P>"Yeah?"<P>"That's just ordinary steel, if we had something hot enough,  one of us could scamper across and out of the airshaft in the main hallway and open the cell."<P>"Hmm..How do you know all this?"<P>"I..um..read alot of books and stuff on battleships...anyway there's no point, we don't have blow-torch."<P>"Well, maybe not a blowtorch..but I have something that can melt the steel."<P>"What?"<P>"Me."<P>"You?"<P>"Yes, me"<P>"How?"<P>"you'll see" Nal closed his eyes and his body began to shimmer. In a flash, Nall disappeared, except for a pill of clothes laying against the cell wall.<P>"What the?"<P>Annie crawled over to the clothes, wondering where Nall went. Then she noticed a small bump wriggling around inside of Nall's shirt and a small squeaky voice called out.<P>"Heeeelp..."<P>Bewildered she opened the shirt revealing a small winged white kitten with a red diamond patch of fur on it's forehead. It mewed and then began to speak.<P>"Thanks"<P>"Nall?"<P>"Yes, it's me" he purred<P>"Oh your so cute!!"  She held hm tightly and squeezed<P>"GAAAAH!! Kitten in pain!! Let go of kitty!!!"<P>Annie either ignored or didn&#8217;t her him as she kept squeezing him, for a few more moments then she yelled trying to put out her shirt, which was on fire.<P>After patting out the small fire, she glowered at the kitten huddled on the pile of clothes.<P>"YOu little!" She lunged to grab him, but he spoke stopping her "WAIT! Straggle me later, first lift me up to the airshaft so I can melt it."<P>"I thought you could fly?"<P>"Not in this form. Sigh, I'm too young and I don't have enough dragon inside me to fly in minor form. Sigh I can only fly as you originally new me."<P>"Dragon? You're really a dragon? And I thought that was just a stupid name."<P>"Quarter -Dragon. And no before you ask I can not enlarge to the big stereotypical dragon! Only granpa can do that. Hey, where is he?"<BR> <BR>"We have been the only ones here. Maybe he is in another cell?"<P>"Maybe"<P>Granpa ,you ok?<P>After a few moments. Nall frowned. <P>"he''s not here or if he is, he is unconscious. I can't here his thoughts..which should normally be easy, they are pretty loud and consistent. well either way, lets get out of here. Lift me up"<P>Using his fiery breath, Nall made short work of the steel bars and scampered up into the airshaft. A few moments later, outside in the hallway a guard cried out and then thudded t the ground unconscious. Then, the tumblers on the cell door clicked loudly and the door slid open and Nall stepped inside.<P>"TADA! Happy to see me?"<P>"Not really, but I take it you're happy to see me?" she said with an devilish smile<P>Nall turned red again "HEY! HEY! Turn around!"<P>She giggled and complied as Nall got his clothes back on.<P>"Stop peeking!"<BR>-------------------------------------<P>Eris moaned loudly and then cried out as she ripped of what remained of her chest plate, taking some flesh with it. She curled up and cried, not from her wounds and broken bones, but from agony. She had felt her body grow and swell as the chemicals contained in her hard-suit flooded though, she could feel every cell gorge on the raw power and ignite. She could feel all her control dissolve; it was like being a puppet on strings. She had no control on what she had tried to inflict on that man...who seemed nice when he wasn't being assaulted, she was aware of everything, but unable to stop. Though she never admitted it..except to Scott, she hated fighting and killing. She always held back, which is why she put in the 'backward' Ghost unit. In a way she was glad, it was her timidness that saved her, and her affection, as forbidden as it was, for Scott which saved him. <P>Being unable to hold back, inflicting pain and suffering, hurt her more then anything she could have ever inflict. But that wasn't the beginning of her pain, she could here some else&#8217;s moans.<P>Scott!<P>Getting up as fast as she could, she clicked the mangled jump jet in her suit, risking detonation and shot up the cliff to find Scott, laying on jagged rock.<P>"SCOTT!" Sh fel down beside him and cradles him.<P>"Er...is" He coughed violently spitting up blood. She wept, clutching him tightly against her chest.<P>"Scott."<P>"Eris..you must go.....not safe...Dread King...nearby...get away..call for evac..."<P>"I'm not leaving you. . Come on get up. Let's go together."<P>"I ...can't. my back is broken......Z1 disk..i can't feel anything below my chest.." He coughed up some more blood, more tears welled up in Eris's eyes.<P>"You'll be fine. You just need time to rest, you'll regenerate."<P>"No....time....*cough*..can't you hear...death coming...." He blacked out.<P>"SCOTT!" She hated that he was right, the unnatural moans of the dead where growing louder. They where getting coser. They wanted to turn them and the others....the others!! That was it, the other bodies where safe and could not be turned, they where behind the barrier. The barrier kept anything undead away, like the zombies or the the remote drones and their bio-drain batteries.<P>"I know you can't hear me, but brace yourself this is going hurt Scott." With a gentle but swift motion she scooped him up, and triggered her last bit of jump juice. Getting just outside the barrier surrounding the temple. Her strength ebbing from her own wounds,  and Scott's unconscious moans. She stumbled inside the barrier and collapsed blacking out.<P>A few hours later, she woke up and carried Scott inside the temple, and settled down against a wall, with his head in her lamp. As they both rested she trigered her emergency beacon, and happily blacked out again.<P><BR>[Come to me little one.....]<P><BR>Who are you....<P>[Come to me..I will take away your pain.....and your lover's]<P>Who are... Suddenly she felt warmth surrounding her, warm motherly love. Which was amazing because she never had a mother..in the natural sense..Her mother was a test tube and her father was knife, as the techs constantly said. <P>[Please get up, and come to me. Bring him wiht you]<P>Opening her eyes, she picked up her poor battered Scott. And she slowly passed through the hallways and deep inside the temple, Coming to a wall, without really knowing why or how, she knew it wasn't really a wall and stepped through and was blinded. She squinted, as bright light poured out around her.<P>[Come to my embrace little ones]<P>"Who are you?"<P>[Come to me and I will reveal all]<P>Eris stepped forward and through the blinding light she saw a tablet floating in the air...it seemed to be the source of the light. She shuffled closer and then her legs gave out and she collapsed in a heap. Very weakly, she stared back up at the tablet, except the tablet was no longer there. A woman was there, somewhat elven in a lush green dress made of plants, she seemed to be holding some sort of staff..<P>[I am the essence of all Norrath's life...I am the Spirit of Norrath..}<P>"Tu...nare" Eris muttered, remembering something she read in a mythology book.<P>[Yes, what is left of me. What you see before you is a memory, set aside to ensure the protection of Norrath from the Void. Unfortunately, since you do see this, it means I am no longer in exisence..But I have set forth this memory to ensure that Void does return.]<P>"Vo...id?"<P>[There is not enough energy left to explain in words. Take the tablet and hold it near your chest and you will see my eyes through yours. Then you will understand..]<P>Still somewhat delirious from her injuries, she reached out gradually and held the D.A.P sized tablet and held against her breast. It glowed warmly and then it disappeared along with her and Scott's wounds. But she couldn't marvel at this, as she was reliving the secrets of eternities through a god's eyes in a matter of moments.<BR>---------------------------------------

After making you wait a long, long time. Ch.3 is finally here. YEAH!!! I am sory about the wait, but you will think ti is well worth it as this is the longest and in my opinion the best chapter I have ever written!! (Aren't my ambitions high ^-^) ANd because the abnormally long wait, even for me, I am going to give a sneak pee of my new story The Many Misadventures of Fry!! Ain't I the best, so sit back relax, crank up Napster and enjoy  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"><BR>----------------<P>---------------------<BR>Chapter 3 Neoteny<BR>---------------------<P><BR>Lilith's world slowly went from pure distortion to complete visibility as she exited the Azure portal. The ancient scrolls the tortured voice in her mind led her to showed her how easy it was to open a dimension gate ..well at least for any one of some intelligence and skill.<P>She was...disappointed..yes thatr seemed to be the right word. The plane of sky was dying. The once flying islands had begun to fall apart , their orbits decaying . Which was distressing, that only happens if the creator was either destroyed or had been gone for a long period of time in Norrathian figuring. Time means nothing in the alter planes.<P>It meant that Veeshan was no longer here, her task of finding the keys to free the voice was now made that much harder. it angered her..that voice would be in her mind so much longer...if she had gained full control of the corporeal bind yet she would have broken into tears at the thought..but to her benefit she had neglected that aspect of biology.<P>She sighed and then turned around preparing to reopen the Azure gate back to Norrath to continue her search for the Luclin keys, but something caught her eye. An island which was about to collapse in on itself from it's decaying orbit began to perk up, it's eternal fall beginning to stabilize....She was near.<P>Two voices spoke from behind her, a man and woman speaking as one.<P>"So you are En-gen's pride. Hmm..Interesting. A combinate being formed from the strongest of Norrath." The voice slowly began to change purifying to just the woman's voice. "Interesting that they would limit you to a Teir'dal form..you could have been anything..but no matter. Why have you come to my realm?"<P>The hairs on the back of Lilith's neck were standing on end from the energy radiating from the being behind her. She turned around and brushing the rogue strands of bluish-black hair that was agitated by the stirring wind, from the front of her face.<P>"Luclin key....now...or..else..." She said as forcibly as her limited knowledge of language.<P>The winged crystalline women laughed. "Or else what? What makes you think I will give you the key to free Void? Foolish puppet, your lack of knowledge and your recent birth prohibits you from being free of the Void's sway. For that you will be forgiven, if you stop this silliness and return to stasis."<P>"Not...As..uah....." Lilith scowled, it infuriated her not being able to voice her ideas. She needed more experience. this body was limiting her mind. She gave up on speaking and entered the woman's mind.<P>I will never return to En-Gen! I shall be free. I will release the voice, get it out of my head. It hurts me!! I want it out!! Now!!! FREE!!! I WANT FREEDOM!!! I will be free, to love like all things..to find<P>As she conveyed her message to the women and image of Nall in his battle in SNG flashed across. As she conveyed it, she felt a feeling of warmth and giddiness pass through her once again.<P>{You are not ready to be free child, you are still newborn and do not yet understand the world. The pain and torment you feel now is nothing compared to what Void will unleash. I will not give you my key. }<P>Lilith felt flushed with heat...this was anger..yes anger Pure powerful anger!!! It was so much that she lost her ability to enter the woman's mind.<P>"Give.sdf .NOW!!!! Me .....abi pain!!!! want...ac ad ..happy!!.......boy.fascc..love!!!!!!!!!"<P>"You see child, if you can not control you anger,or even something as simple as telepathy. You are most certainly not ready to take youplace in this world. Go back to En-Gen rest, gain control of your body. Your mind is strong, just give time to let the rest of you catched up." The woman...Veeshan, is what the voice called her, smiled warmly<P>"Voice....hurt......sad..ahaggg.....say....bkayyou is bad...YOu.....are....evil....will...ton..lis...ten..Veecahn!"<P>You are also easilty pursauded, but you are a fast learner. Child I do not wish to fight you. Please return to En-Gen and focus. I do not wish to force you"<P>"I...Lilith...Can...nboiaoe beten!!!"<P>Veeshan sighed, then stepped backwards fading out of sight<P>Lilith leaped into the air, searching for Veeshan and found her the hard way. A metal fist slammed into her side, the air left her lungs. Another blow upon her back caused the light from her world fade to nothing.<P>As the quickly battered form of Lilith crashed to the island below. A male voice bgan to speak from the figure donned in a two-horned mask of crystal.<P>"Did you have to treat her so badly? She is only a few hours old."<P>"I did what I had to do, you know that better then any one."<P>"Yes...but still..I guess I am becoming soft in my old age. Especially since she is getting hot in the seat for my great-grandson. He is getting popular. Sounds famaliar."<P>"You wish. Let's take her back to En-Gen. She needs to rest and recover. She must acquire more knowledge. Then she would not be so vulnerable to the Void's sway."<P>"I believed it."<P>"Well we never said intelligence was your brightest area."<P>"Hmph. regardless I don't trust En-Gen."<P>"Neither do I. but for right now helping them is the only way to ensure Void's demise."<P>"What an oxy moron..destroying nothing.."<P>The two voices began to speak in unison once again<P>"But none the less it shall be achieved. For it is the purpose of our union."<BR>--------------------------------------<P>As the mixed trio headed down the large ButcherBlock mountain, Dirk begins an impromptu interrogation of his two captured 'Ghosts'.<P>"Why is En-Gen so interested in me? Why did they spend an obvious fortune in sending you 'Ghosts' here?"<P><BR>The girl as she had since her capture, remained silent, a curous mixed air of absolute defiance and subservience surrounding her. The boy Scott responded in a crisp rising tone of speech, like what would be expect of a Private to an officer.<P>"You were a secondary target sir, not a priority. Our orders where to obtain a blood sample and then liquidate you if possible but not risk jeopardizing the primary goal. Which was the mongr-"<P>Dirk whirled around immediately grasping the boy by the collar of his hard suit, Dirk's eyes promising a slow death.<P>"-...Combinate child. She was the Priority. Level one. Everything including the squad was secondary, expendable."<P>"Why?"<P>"I can't say."<P>"Can't or won't?"<P>"Can't."<P>" And why are you being so forthright with all of this information?"<P>"Policy."<P>"Policy? To give up all the information with out even a little protest?"<P>"Yes. The Iron-man routine popularized in stereo casts is useless in real life. You should know that considering your old-"<P>Dirk tightened his grip on the boy's armor.<P>"many years experience. En-Gen policy if we are captured sing. It is why we are never provided with any information not necessary to the mission."<P>"and you just go out like that? Willing to die for no good reason?"<P>"It is what we were trained for."<P>Glancing momentarily glancing over at the girl Eris "Doesn't she ever say anything?"<P>"I outrank her. In situations of capture or at anytime during a mission a  Ghost of lower rank will never speak unless spoken too."<P>"Sigh..military.." Dirk let go of the boy and continued on down the mountain to the transport carrier. For another few hours they continued not speaking , eventually arriving the moderately sized Transport, a 'Jumpboat' class of craft.<P>As Dirk fumbled with the outside lock to the Jumpboat, he heard a few groans of pain. He payed it only a little mind, figuring that it the undead where on the march again, a small problem, but none the less he did not want to deal with them now. Not until he could get some medical attention. As the boat's rear door began to creep open, he felt a hand on his shoulder. He turned around and found himself facing a 9 foot creature, parts of a ripped hardsuit was on it. High on it's chest was the famous En-Gen label and a badge. "Eris'<P>|DIRK!!!| Starlight screamed<P>"What in the-"<P>The creature let loose a deafening roar and hoisted the surprised Dirk above it's head and like a Javelin threw Dirk up the mountain.<BR>----------------------------------<P>A door chimes.<P>"Enter." The Overseer turns his chair around toward the door as an excited gnome enters carrying a DAP.<P>"Shamus, you seem in a excited state. What's up?"<P>"Several things sir. Glorious things really"<P>"Do to tell"<P>"Our  Ghost team dispatched to Selvatoria and Faydwer were succesful sir. More then, though they did suffer heavier losses then expected."<P>"Hmm. Break it down."<P>"Our Selvatorian team capured the blade for Lilith and acquired the boy. From what we have extracted at the moment via Hypno. His name is Nall Tayus, and like we predicted he is in fact 1 quarter dragon. I'll have further details in my report later. Also in the raid we acquired the SNG champion Aquamarine, who has also been moonlighting as a treasure hunter and superhero. But more importantly she can be ransomed later on for further project funds. Her family is quite wealthy, Almost as rich as En-gen."<P>"Hmph. I fid that hard to belive, but continue. What about the ancestor?"<P>"Unfortunately the ancestor escaped our grasp. It was far stronger then those 1'2t generation Ghost's. Maybe if we had authorized the use of the Neoteny formula...but that's speculation. Regardless, it escaped momentarily and was subsequently buried whenn we blasted the site via the Stratokracker."<P>"Stratokracker? I thought we agreed on Mana Cannon?"<P>"....It doesn't really matter. San-Green., Mana Cannon, Stratokracker..the name is isn't imporatant..though I prefer Final Heavan myself.."<P>"Hehe..What of Lilith?"<P>"Captured by Rashan and brought to the Gunboat Diplomat. Also the the boy and Aquamarine have been placed onboard the Diplomat.Sir..Permission to getr off subject?"<P>" Of course, no need to be so formal Shamus."<P>"I don't trust Rashan. I think it is a grave mistake to put so much trust in him...her...whatever the hell Rashan is."<P>"Rashan won't be much of a concern once we complete Lilith. Rashan will be her first assignment, trial by fire."<P>"If Lilith could beat Rashan, there will be no stopping us. Rashan is quite duanting."<P>"Yes. Well anyway, what of the dispatch to Faydwer?"<P>"Just barely above a disaster. Majority of the team was killed, only the commander escaped though by help of Rashan again. Though we are still getting readings from two other Ghost's, they may be being held for interrogation. We can't tell their Hard suits have been heavily damaged. But that is not the major points sir. 1. We acquired a sample of Dirk Lunas and it is currently being integrated into Lilith as we speak. 2. We acquired the child and are running a complete work up on her in our Deep six station underneath Timorous. But what we have gotten with just prelim's is unbelievable."<P>"What?"<P>"We determined her father."<P>"Who?"<P>"Dirk AND Maxim"<P>"WHAT !?! That's impossible!"<P>"Yes as unbelievable as it sounds. Both Maxim and Dirk are the chld's father. We have no idea how this happened, but she has a profile matching the mother, Dirk and Maxim. This is just incredible. Even at her young age, she is already exhibiting fantastic powers, at this moment her potential MT level already matches Lilith. This more then explains the Dread King's interest in her, by the gods, if he hadn't extracted her and that barrier failed. I hate to think about it." <P>"A small child like that, born of woman matching the collective work of years and of research..unbelievable. I trust you are integrating her profile in Lilith?"<P>"Of course!"<P>"Speaking of the child what of the father..er one of the fathers. Dirk?"<P>"Unfortunately he is still alive though heavily injured. At the moment we suspect, he is interrogating the remaining Ghosts. Should we explode their hearts sir?"<P>"What? No don't be silly. They may be 1st generation, but they are still valuable..for now. Lets keep our 40 million platinum investments. "<P>The Overseer opens a panel on his table and depresses a button.<P>|Stratospheric monitoring online Overseer|<P>"Switch to <I>Final Heavan</I>.."He smiles at Shamus" Camera 3b and display"<P>A holographic image of an Arial view of Faydwer, floats in the air at head level of the Overseer. <P>"Target Ghost Units in area and Lock on"<P>|Acquiring......Target Lock...Fire Final Heavan?|<P>"No."<P>|Final Heavan powering down from Stratospheric strike readiness. What is your order Overseer?|<P>"Activate Neoteny. Code Overseer Alpha One"<P>|Code accepted.. Neoteny Genetic Transmutation Activated. Do you wish to magnify and enhance view Overseer?|<P>"No. You've seen one bloodbath, you've seen another. Display off."<P>"Hmph. Bloodbath is a polite way of putting it. Sir, why did you want Lilith to be transported on the Qeynos flagship? It is rather slow."<P>"I know, but our recent actions have been picking up a lot of negative media and public attention. Especially when we use our own resources, who ever thought of the the public's <I>right</I> to know, needs to be dragged out into the steet and shot."<P>"Which street?"<P>"oo..I dunno.. how about all of them?"<P>As the two continued to discuss other matters, far away on the undead continent of Faydwer. The two Ghost's, Eris and Scott, began to cry out in pain, as their bodies began to rip and tear. Muscles and sinew shredded, rgrew and swelled. No longer where they pinnacles of stealth and covert operations. They where monsters demons almost..designed for one thing and one thing only. To destroy everything in their path.<BR>---------------------------------------<P>Blackness then stars... everything was spinning around..<P>"Where are am I?" Dirk mumbled<P>|I suggest you get up and fast you have two big uglies coming toward you| Starlight suggested<P>"Who are ...you? Star..li?" Two heavy thuds sounded behind him. Dirk groggily rotated around to face to large demonic creatures. Standing 9 feet tall and rippling muscle adorned in mangled metal/ceramic armor. They stared directly into his eyes and roared so lud that the ground quaked.<P>"Oh shi-"<P>One of them piced him up like a doll and began to slam him up and down against the jagged rock, inflicting more wounds on the battered Black Elf. After a baker's dozen of slams the creature hoisted him up so they where face to face. It opened it's great maw and  roared once again as millions of volts of electricity coursed through. As much as it hurt Dirk did not cry out, unknown if it was for bracery or for inabilty from the amount current flowing through. Soon the beast let up, Dirk hung limp. It roared was again and  let his body drop to the dirt. The beast growled once and then with the other prepared to head down the mountain. It crouched down to make a leap but just as it tensed a fist smashed into it's spine shattering it.  Before the beast could howl two hands wrapped around it's mouth and face and yanked down and backwards right into a hard knee, knocking the beast out.<P>The other was somewhat surprised from the swiftness and power of Dirk's return assualt, the moments hesitation was more then enough for Dirk. In then that brief moment, mana gathered within Dirk's body.<P>"Nocturne Beam!" The beam of darkness struck the best in the chest, melting the chest plate and catapulting the beast of the cliff.<P>"Man...I need a vacation.."<P>|Well no rest for you yet Dirk. We still have to find Trini.|<P>The reminder of Trini,, momentarily eased his wounds and salved his numerous burns.<P>"Yes.But where to start?"<P>|I'm sure that the transport has a course already in the auto pilot. It may be a good place to start.|<P>"Yes.."<P>Picking him self of the cold rock, he slowly limped down the mountain to the Jumpboat. His resolve unwavering but his wounds soon began to take it's toll and even  Dirk's might couldn't keep up forever. Luckily the craft was in reach, he stumbled inside and as he began to black out, he thumbed the autopilot.<P>|Rest well, Dirk|<BR>--------------------------------<P>Nall slowly opened his eyes,  he could still taste the chloroform. <P>"Yech.."<P>"Yeah. I know you would have thought the could have given me a decent shirt to wear."<P>That voice seemed familiar...it wasn't..it couldn't be.. he opened his eyes and looked up...it was<P>"Aquamarine!?!"<P>He stared at the human girl in the ragged dirty oily shirt and mechanics pants.<P>"Yes. Looks like we are stuck together."<P>"Great. I lose all my money, find a way to make some, you interfere, again! And no I have been capture by the gods only know and I am once again with you!"<P>"Seems like you have a crush."<P>"Wha.AJ I..You.." Nal stammered in a flustered state<P>Aquamarine giggled as Nall's face began to match the red strip of hair above his brow.<P>"Hehe. Look for what it's worth, I'm sorry about what happened on SNG."<P>"And what about now?"<P>"Oh, this your fault"<P>"My fault! None of this would have happened if you hadn't butted in!"<P>" Doesn't matter now"   "...even though it is your fault" she mumbles<P>"Huh?"<P>"Nothing. So what is your name? YOur real name I mean unless you like being called Kid Draco?"<P>"No most definitely not. Nall."<P>"Annie..my real name is Anita but I prefer Annie. I wonder what they want from us on a Battle cruiser?"<P>"Battle cruiser?"<P>"Yeah, we are on the Qeynoes Royal Battle cruiser <I>Gunboat Diplomat</I>. The largest and most powerful sea-based craft on Norrath."<P>"I thought the Palsian 'cruiser <I>Limiting Factor</I> was the most powerful ship?"<P>Annie fumed and turn red, angry red not the embarrassed red Nall was. "IT IS NOT!! MY DA-..I mean the Diplomat is biggest most powerful ship on Norrath."<P>"Whatever. It's just another sailboat"<P>Annie grew even redder, Nall oblivious to her rising anger sighed loudly lamenting about his still broken Airship.<P>"I don't think you know of any way to get out of here do you?"<P>"No..well. there is one way but we don't have blow torch."<P>"What? melt the hinges of the door?"<P>"No, thats reinforced Quatain, straight from the deepest Selvatorian mines. JUst like my suit....That stuff is hard is damage."<P>"Then what?"<P><BR>"See the air shaft above me? "<P>"Yeah?"<P>"That's just ordinary steel, if we had something hot enough,  one of us could scamper across and out of the airshaft in the main hallway and open the cell."<P>"Hmm..How do you know all this?"<P>"I..um..read alot of books and stuff on battleships...anyway there's no point, we don't have blow-torch."<P>"Well, maybe not a blowtorch..but I have something that can melt the steel."<P>"What?"<P>"Me."<P>"You?"<P>"Yes, me"<P>"How?"<P>"you'll see" Nal closed his eyes and his body began to shimmer. In a flash, Nall disappeared, except for a pill of clothes laying against the cell wall.<P>"What the?"<P>Annie crawled over to the clothes, wondering where Nall went. Then she noticed a small bump wriggling around inside of Nall's shirt and a small squeaky voice called out.<P>"Heeeelp..."<P>Bewildered she opened the shirt revealing a small winged white kitten with a red diamond patch of fur on it's forehead. It mewed and then began to speak.<P>"Thanks"<P>"Nall?"<P>"Yes, it's me" he purred<P>"Oh your so cute!!"  She held hm tightly and squeezed<P>"GAAAAH!! Kitten in pain!! Let go of kitty!!!"<P>Annie either ignored or didn't her him as she kept squeezing him, for a few more moments then she yelled trying to put out her shirt, which was on fire.<P>After patting out the small fire, she glowered at the kitten huddled on the pile of clothes.<P>"YOu little!" She lunged to grab him, but he spoke stopping her "WAIT! Straggle me later, first lift me up to the airshaft so I can melt it."<P>"I thought you could fly?"<P>"Not in this form. Sigh, I'm too young and I don't have enough dragon inside me to fly in minor form. Sigh I can only fly as you originally new me."<P>"Dragon? You're really a dragon? And I thought that was just a stupid name."<P>"Quarter -Dragon. And no before you ask I can not enlarge to the big stereotypical dragon! Only granpa can do that. Hey, where is he?"<BR> <BR>"We have been the only ones here. Maybe he is in another cell?"<P>"Maybe"<P>Granpa ,you ok?<P>After a few moments. Nall frowned. <P>"he''s not here or if he is, he is unconscious. I can't here his thoughts..which should normally be easy, they are pretty loud and consistent. well either way, lets get out of here. Lift me up"<P>Using his fiery breath, Nall made short work of the steel bars and scampered up into the airshaft. A few moments later, outside in the hallway a guard cried out and then thudded t the ground unconscious. Then, the tumblers on the cell door clicked loudly and the door slid open and Nall stepped inside.<P>"TADA! Happy to see me?"<P>"Not really, but I take it you're happy to see me?" she said with an devilish smile<P>Nall turned red again "HEY! HEY! Turn around!"<P>She giggled and complied as Nall got his clothes back on.<P>"Stop peeking!"<BR>-------------------------------------<P>Eris moaned loudly and then cried out as she ripped of what remained of her chest plate, taking some flesh with it. She curled up and cried, not from her wounds and broken bones, but from agony. She had felt her body grow and swell as the chemicals contained in her hard-suit flooded though, she could feel every cell gorge on the raw power and ignite. She could feel all her control dissolve; it was like being a puppet on strings. She had no control on what she had tried to inflict on that man...who seemed nice when he wasn't being assaulted, she was aware of everything, but unable to stop. Though she never admitted it..except to Scott, she hated fighting and killing. She always held back, which is why she put in the 'backward' Ghost unit. In a way she was glad, it was her timidness that saved her, and her affection, as forbidden as it was, for Scott which saved him. <P>Being unable to hold back, inflicting pain and suffering, hurt her more then anything she could have ever inflict. But that wasn't the beginning of her pain, she could here some else's moans.<P>Scott!<P>Getting up as fast as she could, she clicked the mangled jump jet in her suit, risking detonation and shot up the cliff to find Scott, laying on jagged rock.<P>"SCOTT!" Sh fel down beside him and cradles him.<P>"Er...is" He coughed violently spitting up blood. She wept, clutching him tightly against her chest.<P>"Scott."<P>"Eris..you must go.....not safe...Dread King...nearby...get away..call for evac..."<P>"I'm not leaving you. . Come on get up. Let's go together."<P>"I ...can't. my back is broken......Z1 disk..i can't feel anything below my chest.." He coughed up some more blood, more tears welled up in Eris's eyes.<P>"You'll be fine. You just need time to rest, you'll regenerate."<P>"No....time....*cough*..can't you hear...death coming...." He blacked out.<P>"SCOTT!" She hated that he was right, the unnatural moans of the dead where growing louder. They where getting coser. They wanted to turn them and the others....the others!! That was it, the other bodies where safe and could not be turned, they where behind the barrier. The barrier kept anything undead away, like the zombies or the the remote drones and their bio-drain batteries.<P>"I know you can't hear me, but brace yourself this is going hurt Scott." With a gentle but swift motion she scooped him up, and triggered her last bit of jump juice. Getting just outside the barrier surrounding the temple. Her strength ebbing from her own wounds,  and Scott's unconscious moans. She stumbled inside the barrier and collapsed blacking out.<P>A few hours later, she woke up and carried Scott inside the temple, and settled down against a wall, with his head in her lamp. As they both rested she trigered her emergency beacon, and happily blacked out again.<P><BR>[Come to me little one.....]<P><BR>Who are you....<P>[Come to me..I will take away your pain.....and your lover's]<P>Who are... Suddenly she felt warmth surrounding her, warm motherly love. Which was amazing because she never had a mother..in the natural sense..Her mother was a test tube and her father was knife, as the techs constantly said. <P>[Please get up, and come to me. Bring him with you]<P>Opening her eyes, she picked up her poor battered Scott. And she slowly passed through the hallways and deep inside the temple, Coming to a wall, without really knowing why or how, she knew it wasn't really a wall and stepped through and was blinded. She squinted, as bright light poured out around her.<P>[Come to my embrace little ones]<P>"Who are you?"<P>[Come to me and I will reveal all]<P>Eris stepped forward and through the blinding light she saw a tablet floating in the air...it seemed to be the source of the light. She shuffled closer and then her legs gave out and she collapsed in a heap. Very weakly, she stared back up at the tablet, except the tablet was no longer there. A woman was there, somewhat elven in a lush green dress made of plants, she seemed to be holding some sort of staff..<P>[I am the essence of all Norrath's life...I am the Spirit of Norrath..}<P>"Tu...nare" Eris muttered, remembering something she read in a mythology book.<P>[Yes, what is left of me. What you see before you is a memory, set aside to ensure the protection of Norrath from the Void. Unfortunately, since you do see this, it means I am no longer in exisence..But I have set forth this memory to ensure that Void does return.]<P>"Vo...id?"<P>[There is not enough energy left to explain in words. Take the tablet and hold it near your chest and you will see my eyes through yours. Then you will understand..]<P>Still somewhat delirious from her injuries, she reached out gradually and held the D.A.P sized tablet and held against her breast. It glowed warmly and then it disappeared along with her and Scott's wounds. But she couldn't marvel at this, as she was reliving the secrets of eternities through a god's eyes in a matter of moments.<BR>---------------------------------------<P>Metal fragments and roofing shuddered as a weary battered form, uncovered itself from the smoldering ruins in Selvatoria.<P>ow...what in the hell was that?<P>The fragments gave way, revealing the platinum top of Reyas. He slowly pulls himself from underneath  the rubble, finally free his first act of freedom was to fall asleep. Or at least try to. As he began to slip away a loud roar echoed above him.<P>O what now?<P> He rolled his eyes up and saw a dropship flaring it's engines to land. As the ship kicked up a minor dust storm, Reyas slowly got up to his feet and summoned his weapon of choice a broadsword forged of mana. He  limped slightly to the back of the ship. As the DropShip's door opened Reyas stood at ready, tensing to take on anything before him. The door crashed on the dirt and then....<P>Nothing. No one came out, no sign of life at all. Relieved and disappointed at the same time, Reyas limped up the ramp and entered the craft, his eyes constantly scanning looking for something, which he was rewarded for.<P>"DIE YOU  SCUM!!!"<P>A prism blade flashed out of nowhere, colliding with Reyas's sword  emitting a shower of sparks. Holding the blade away with one hand, he aimed his other in the darkness where the blade was coming from and cast a spell.<P>"Grav Disruption" A ripple emitted from his hand and the unseen assailant grunted and flew backwards into the wall of the ship.<P>"ow..sonofa..." The form got back to it's feet and charged again<P>"You En-gen punks don't learn do you." Reyas extended both of us hands "Grav Disruption"  The form smashed into the wall again. This time Reyas's charged sword at ready and just as suddenly stopped, the attacker finally coming into view. A Black elf in a mangled hardsuit, but not a En-gen suit.<P>"You're not with En-gen!!" They both said in surprised noticing the lack of the glaring En-Gen label.<P>"No kidding. Who are you?" They said at the same time again.<P>"My name is Reyas."<P>"Dirk..Dirk Lunas...help me up will you..man you pack a punch. either that or I am getting old...maybe both.ow my back."<P>"You don't even know the meaning of old." Reyas smirked, pulling the battered Dirk up to his feet. <P>"Man, your in bad shape" They said at the same time again studying each other.<P>"That is getting old, and yeah. Not surprising after getting jumped by some of En-gen's goons, not to mention being blasted  on top of the head."<P>"So we have one thing in common oh.." Dirk collapsed.<P>"Looks like you took the worst beating" Reyas  pressed his hands against Dirk covering him with a light blue aura. Dirk perked up slightly.<P>"Thanks...It's been a long day."<P>"You should sleep. I have to see about finding my grandson."<P>"If, En-Gen is involved....then...the last.." Dirk's speech began to slur as he began to black out "auto..pilot...setting..maybe.." He finally succumbed.<P>"Sleep well.That's not such a bad idea for me." Reyas left the sleeping black elf and thumbed the autopilot. As the ship closed up and boosted off the ground, Reyas shimmered and returned to his lower form and curled up in the pilots chair<P>That's better...I hate being in mature form.....at least now.....<P>As the ship soared of into the distance, Reyas reminisced..<P>I should of known better then fall in love with an ephemeral....but then I couldn't imagine my life without falling in love with her..at least in a way she is still living through our offspring...but then like all ephemerals...they will die too....can i really take any  more passing away? it was Dyane that kept me alive....what will keep me around now? <P>----------------------------------------------------<BR>"Leylia........Wake up...please...I need you..."<P>Reyas sobbed and pleaded for an endless time, but the old but still bueatiful form of Leylia stayed prone in her deathbed.<P>As the days blurred by, the funeral and then the wake passed. Reyas stayed in his room in Palsa, seeking no company from anyone. He just sat in his rocking chair looking out across the sky, through Leylia's favorite window. On the tray beside him, a lone glass of water and a state of the art  Gnome and Becker single shot ball and powder hand pistol.<BR>-------------------------------------------<P>Nall and Annie slinked past guards and security cameras aimlessly wandering around the immense <I> Gunboat Diplomat</I> , trying unsuccessfully to find a way out. After nearly an hour of wandering, they found their way to a refitted cargo hold. The hold had been refitted into a research facility, dozens of computers clicked and whistled emitting  a rainbow of lights. In the center of this tech's wet dream was a large plastic tube filled with a transparent fluid. Floating in this fluid was purple haired Dark elf.<P>"What in the ?" Annie exclaimed<P>"Man! I have never seen anything like this. This stuff is way above the cutting edge...hmm maybe i can scrounge a few things for my..WOW!!! Look at her!!!"<P>With out even checking to see if any one was in the lab, he hopped over the guard rail and fell down to the lab floor and dashed over to the stasis chamber.<P>"Nall! Wait..oh crap.." <P>She fumed for a bit and jumped down and moved beside him as he was staring up at the naked dark elf floating in front of him.<P>"Keep calm frisky one." She teased at him, making him flush red.<P>"Um..what do you think they where doing to her?"<P>"Who knows. But it wasn't any good, take a look at this." She says pointing at a label on one of the consoles.<P>"En-Gen..figures"<P>"Yeah."<P>"let's break her out"<P>"You just want to ogle her more.dont you?"<P>"I do not!!....ok.maybe..Go find a robe or something for her."<P>"Ok" Annie leaves for a moment, as Nall tries to figure out how to open the stasis chamber.<P>{Press the red button}<P>"Who said that!?!"<P>{Turn around.}<P>Nall complied and faced a small viewing cabinet with a sword hanging in it. Nall stared at it bewildered.<P>{I know I am pretty but stop staring!}<P>"HUH!?!" Nall exclaimed<P>{Hehe..You get flustered so easily...I am going to like you..take me out}<P>Nall did so, as he grasped the hlt he felt a flash of warmth pass over him.<P>{!!!! You are part dragon!}<P>"Yeah. So?"<P>{It's been so long since I have had a dragon.escpecially who knows just where to touch me}<P>"!!!!" Nall turned red again<P>{Heheheheehe. You are so much fun. }<P>Nall still somewhat flustered, turned around and hit the red release button. The stasis tube began to empty rapidly, and then once empty the plastic tube receded into the ceiling. The girl collapsed in a heap.<P>"Found a lab coat!" Annie shouted<P>"Bring it!"<P>The girl's breathing slowly crept up to normal and as she adjusted from the stasis , she slowly opened her eyes.<P>"Hi there." Nall said noticing she was staring at him<P>She grinned and leapt off the platform and into his arms squeezing him and giggling happily.<P>"Nice to see you too!" Nall said grinning wider then the giggling girl in his arms<P>{Oooh! Down boy! Down}<P>Nall turned red again<BR>------------------------------------<P>The alter plane was eerily calm as the crimson gate opened on top of a pillar. It was far too quiet for place known for the screams of the damned. But even the damned are quiet when He is near.<P>A figure donned in jet-black armor emerged from the gate, the ground that he stood on crackled as his aura turned black hot.<P>"Ahh. So my wayward reaver returns to me." The disembodied voice chuckled shaking the plane.<P>"return yes, but to you never. I have long since escaped your reach."<P>"My reach extends further then you think Raziel. Do not forget that I created you and I can destroy you. I will only tolerate your insolence so long."<P>Raziel laughed almost as greatly as the faceless god "Now who is being insolent." Raziel laughed louder "Your reach is limited and like the Dread King, I am beyond you."<P>"Or so you think. Look around my reaver. Do you not see the fields..the endless fields of souls. All plucked from  the soil of Norrath. All of them swell my army."<P>"All your army is useless and you know it. If the Void is released even your pathetic rabble will not enough to stop it."<P>"So your motive  for coming is revealed." The faceless one Cazic-Thule, the lord of Fear. The most powerful of the Gods came into sight. The god laughed again. "You want the key to the void."<P>"Yes. Only the strong should protect Norrath and that is not you."<P>"And you are? Haha! You are already succumbing to the Void's influence as we speak. It is only a matter of time till you serve the Void. Not even your femine half can protect you."<P>"I need no one to protect me nor do I serve any one." Raziel levitated off the pillar and began to radiate with power "But I tire of this petty banter ..Za'Amor"<P>If it where possible, it almost seemed like the Faceless one flinched at the sound of his true name. Raziel outstretched his hand to the god and his terrible weapon the black flame demon blade, the Kirosawa materialized<P>"Give ...me... your Key!"<P>The Faceless roared with laughter. "Fool. You have had the key for half a millennia."<P>"What!?!" <P>"Still do not realize,  the key is a mimc, just like your other halfs key. Can't you feel it twisting your soul. Destroying you from the inside? Can't you feel the nothingness stretch across your being? Memories you once cherished now gone?"<P>Raziel for the first time found himself dumbstruck for a few moments, slowly recovering he extended his other hand and a katana of purest crystal materialized, the Nagitaka, Veeshan's blade. <P>You didn't tell me!?!<P>Raziel..I ...<P>YOU....<P>Raz..<P>SHUT UP!!!<P>Raziel ignited with flames as his anger took hold of him. The Nagitaka vanished and Raziel leapt at the faceless one, burying the Kirosawa deep into the god. Instead of cries of pain the god laughed.<P>"Before I destroy you. Tell me, why where the keys created in the first place! Why give Void a chance to return!"<P>The go laughed again "That you will have to ask to your other side...my reaver. Go forth and dance upon the strings of Void..."<P>The god disappeared, leaving Raziel alone. As Raziel disappeared into the shadows to return to Norrath, Cazic-Thule's laughter continued amongest the renewed screams of the damned.<BR>----------------------------------------------------<BR>The pistol rest against his forehead. The hammer ****ed and ready. A dove flew in and sat on the window. It walked around the sill for a few moments and then leapt away frightened at the loud noise of gunshot. The pistol clattered on the ground, Reyas  full of weariness  turned to his hand where the pistol once was, to stare at the distraught and terrified face of Dyane<BR>.<P>"WHAT ARE YOU DOING!?!"<P>"Leave me alone. Let me die in peace."<P>"Papa." Dyane begin to cry and clutched her father. Reyas shook her off.<P>"Go away...I'm tired of living....Tired of watching all of my friends...and everyone I love die..."<P><BR>"Death comes to all things......."<P>"NOT ME!! I have been alive longer then there was time!! I am older then death is! I am sick of this....go away..let me die"<P>"Death comes to all things papa, even you some day..me..my brother...my children...someday they wil pass away too. but that is one of the facts of life."<P>"What's the point of it all..."<P>"To live. To make the most of your existence. Not to throw it away, papa. You loved mom and she loved you. Do you think she would want you to throw your life away?"<P>"No..."<P>"And in a way shes not gone. Look at me Papa. Didn't you always say that I was the mirror image of mom?"<P>Reyas turned back to her and stared. He smiled slighty. "Yes."<P>"As long as the family goes on, so will she. We love you Papa, and so does she. We won't leave you and niether will she."<P>Reyas smiled through some tears. Dyane kissed Reyas on the forehead. "You need to get some rest Papa."  Taking a blanket off the bed, she draped it over him. So he could nap watching the sky, through her mother's favorite window. In a few moments, he was snoring, quietly she picked up the pistol and with one hand crushed it.<BR>-------------------------------------<P>A rumble shook the Jumpboat, waking Reyas from his dream. It was dark and overcast and beginning  to storm.<P>"How did this cat get in here?" said a voice behind the pilots chair "Shoo!!!"<P>"Oh shoo yourself Dirk!"<P>"Reyas!?!"<P>"Duh"<P>"How..nevermind. I don't want to knoww. Where are we?"<P>"I can't tell through all of these clouds." A lightning bolt went off brightning the dark craft.<P>"Hey there is boat, down there in the water. Not a very big one though."<P>Reyas jumped up upon Dirk's shoulders and wapped him on the back of the head.  "We are 35 thousand feet in the air! Of course it's tiny!!"<P>"OW!"<BR>---------------------------------------------<P>"HEY!! I found my hard suit!!" Annie called out across the lab<P>"Cool. hey let go!...come on! let go! please..stop.HEY!!! Don't touch that!!! ehehheeAAHHAAHAHAHH!! Stop tickling me!! HAHAHAHAHAHHAAHA"<P>"What is going on over there?" Annie peered back over to where Nall was being tickled by the newly freed giggling girl.<P>"GET YOUR HANDS OF HIM!!!!" Annie screamed startling both Nall and the girl. The girl scowled at Annie and then stuck her tongue out her. Annie fumed and lunged at the girl, but before she grab hold and start pulling at the girl's hair. Nall jumped inbetween them.<P>"Ladies. There is plenty of me to go around, no need to fight over me."<P>"FIGHT OVER YOU!!!!!...I AM NOT FIGHTING OVER YOU!!" She screeched. " I am simply trying to help you, by keeping a subversive naked hussy from swaying you"<P>The girl, though while not entirely understanding all of Annie's words did catch her tone and direction of sentence. So she clutched Nall closer and stuck her tongue out at Annie. Annie fumed and lunged at the girl again, but was intercepted by Nall again.<P>"Ladies! Please let us get out of here first!"<P>Annie scowled once again, then turned away and went back to where she was a few moments ago. "That's what I was talking about. I found my hardsuit, it's in this lab...but it's locked" She smiles "not that it is a problem. The wrist transponder is outside though ."<P>She holds up a small electronic wristband. <P>"How does that help us? Let go! I can't breath..." The girl still holds on tightly<P>Annie frowns. "Watch this" She depresses a button on the wristband and her body fades slightly. The dismantled hardsuit on the other side of the glass, disappears. A few seconds , Annie fades back in fully encompassed by her hardsuit.<P>"TADA!!!" She giggles and gives Nall the peace symbol.<P>"COOL! Solid to Mana conversion!!" Nall wriggles out of the unnamed girl's hug to admire Annie/Aquamarine. The girl scowls as while Nall's back is turned, Annie has the hardsuit face plate retract and she sticks her tonque out at the girl.<P><BR>""You three are terrible."" a voice spoke<P>"Who said that?"<BR>"Who said that?"<P>'"Me, the sword. Atwight. I hate to interrupt this hilarious love triangle, but we should try to get out of here before we are discovered." <P>"Atwight is right. Let's go."<BR>------------------------------------<BR>"It seems like that ship is our destination. From the size of it, I would say that is the Gunboat Diplomat."<P>"How can you tell?"<P>"I can see from here that there are over 100 guns on the thing. No other ship in history has that many guns or ever carried such a large array of guns. Even the previous ones held obscene amounts of armaments."<P>"I take it you are as old as I am?"<P>"Probably older then you can dream. We will be landing in a few minutes, get ready!"<P>A large beam of light opens the sky and cuts through the Gunboat Diplomat.<P>"HOLY!!!"<P>"WHOA!!" They both shout as a shockwave rocks the Jumpboat, as they recover from the jolting. They look back out the window to see the Gunboat Diplomat in two pieces. One smaller piece, the forehalf was already sinking, the larger half was listing about to go under.<P>"NALL!!"<BR>"TRINI!!!"<P>The Jumpboat accelerated and dove toward the sinking battlecruiser.<BR>-----------------------------<P>"You know all things considered. That was way too easy." Annie said as they sneaked up onto the main deck.<P>"Don't jinx it. All we have to do is make it to that jumpcraft and we are s-"<P>The sound of rifles beign ****ed echos in the previously silent night air.<P> "FREEZE!!"<P>"-afe..."<P>"I told you this was to easy..." They raise their arms and turn around to a platoon of armed guards.<P>The sound of metal clanking upon the deck comes from behind them. The guards shift their aim to the new presence and then stand down to at-ease posture.<P>"Leave us" Calls the deep voice.<P>"SIR! YES SIR!!"<P>The platoon snaps a salute and vanishes back into the ship. Nall, Annie and the silent girl turn around to face a figure completely covered in jet-black armor. The girl trembled slightly and hid behind Nall.<P>"Who are you!"<P>"A messenger."<P>"What's the message?"<P>"Abandon the girl and flee if you wish to see another day. Do not listen her lies about the Void. It must not be freed."<P>"And if I choose not to heed this mesage?"<P>The man glowed slightly.<P>"You die."<P>"I don't think so" Nall stepped up, making sure that Annie and the girl were behind him. The girl realizing what was happening ran up to Nall and clutched him, shaking her head trying to stop him from fighting the man in black armor.<P>Nall wiggled out of her grip and assumed a fighting posture, the armored man did the same.<P>"N...Nall...l..ive" the girl said..her first words in their entire time together.<P>Nall leap into the air, twisting slightly to gain momentum and punched straight at the man's chest. It was easily parried as where the next series of blows. Nall floated in mid air just above the man's head, attacking with all the speed and strength he could muster, but to no avail. On his next punch, the man caught it and squeezed and then thrust the palm of his other hand into Nall's face sending Nall crashing to the ground. Nall didn't stay on the ground though he , leapt back to his feet and dashed under the man's guard, delivering to sharp blows to the chest, he reared back as mana flowed through hs body.<P>"I hope you you're okay! Cause you're only going to get a chance to see this once!! GRAV BUSTER!!!"<P>Nall flew forward fist first glowing with magic, his fist alit with power smashed into the man's face plate, then just at the point of contact. The very gravity of Norrath fluxed, catipulting the man away with the force of hundreds of times of Norrath's normal gravity.<P>Two disks whipped from behind Nall's head and collided with sailing man. The disks exploded and the man just hovered in the air encompassed by a pulsing blue field.<P>"What in the?" Nall turned around to Annie, who was crouched down, a launcher on her back, shuddered and retreated back inside quyickly replaced by a laser emitter.<P><BR>"What are you.." Nall paused as he noticed a red dot on his forehead.<P>"Watch this, scoot over Nall"<P>Nall complied and the red dot landed center on the chest of the hovering man.<P>Annie began to mutter something "Hacking complete...iniating reorienting....prepping almost complete......."<P>"What are you doing!"<P>"Watch this!" Annie stood up, the laser retreated, she raised her hand in to the sky.<P>"Lock on complete! FIRE SAN-GREEN!!!"<P>Nall rolled his eyes up and the cloudy skies began to brighten.<BR>----------------------<BR>Dozens of miles in the air the stratospheric mana based cannon rotated and reoriented towards a point upon Norrath. One of it's cylinders cycled into position, the firing hammer  clicked into position, the anti-inertia jets filled with fuel. The hammer fell...<P>--------------------------<BR>Forgive me my love...<P>......<P>Please...I didn't...I was afraid....I didn't know how you would take it....<P>..................<P>Please...You need me...I need you....<P>Very well....<P>---------------------------<P>The blue field shattered and the man in the black armor disappeared.<P>Annie surprised by his disappeaance only said one thing "Uh-oh"<P>The clouds parted and a beam of pure mana cut through the sky and sliced straight down through the mighty battlecruiser and down on into the ocean. The skockwave of wind flung everyone into the air. Nall, Annie and the girl crashed  into a heap ontop of one another, but not for long as the once invincible ship began to list.<P>(Music Cue: Duel of The Fates: Star Wars The Phantom Menace)<P>The forward section of the Diplomat fell beneath the waves and the larger half began to dance against the surging ocean. But in a few moment eerily, the waves began to calm. A new figure materialized out the air, someone doned in light blue almost cloth like material, an unknown metal formed plates at vital areas of the fiure and it wore a two horned mask of crystal..<P>As the trio slowly untangled themselves and faced the new figure, a katana of black flames materialized it's right hand. The new enemy, performed a short kata with the blade and then extended it's left hand. A katana of purest crystal appeared. It brought both blades to bear in front of it, and with a sharp motion slammed the hilts together. Bolts of energy crackled the air and around the new double sided weapon. The figure crouched down and extended a free hand, and with it motioned to the trio..bring it on.<P>A vibro blade released it self from Annie's right arm of her hardsuit, she tensed ready to spring.<P>[Well what are you waiting for use me]<P>I'm terrible with swords, I stick to my hands.<P>[I'll refrain from making a mean comment.......just wield me and I will guide you]<P>Nall followed Atwight's instructions and readied the sentient blade. He charged, in close pursuit was Annie. They both swung at the assaislant and found them both being easily parried, no matter how hard they tried, they could'nt slip through his defense. In a few moments, they wfound themselves flying through the air again, propelled by a wall of force from the attacker. They crashed in a heap on the hull, the wind knocked out of them.<P>The attacker, dropped his guard and turned to the shivering girl how had not joined in the attack.<P>"You should have listened to us, before hand. If you continue on this path, you and your friends will die" The figure said in a strange overlapping voice a man and a woman in unity.<BR> <BR>"GIVE HER BACK TO ME YOU FREAK!!!" A voice boomed across the night. The attacker looked up to see a black elf, in mangled armor, a sword held high plumeting out of the sky.<BR>---------------------------------<P>Just above, the mortally damaged Diplomat, the Jumpboat hovered. Reyas looked down in complete surprise as he saw a figure apppear out of thin air. <P>That mask...it's crystal..but aside from that it's exactly like Raziel's...it can't be..Raziel? Alive?<P>Dirk also saw the same figure appear out of the air.<P>"That's him!! He took Trini!! I'll kill him!!Open the hatch!!!"<P>"I can't We are too high up ,we'll decompre-"<P>"OPEN THE  DAMNED DOOR!!!"<P>"I can't until we get lower!!!"<P>Dirk cried out and turned toward the door and broke out into a flat run.<P>"Dirk! What the hell are you do-" Reyas couldn't finish as Dirk slammed into and through the doors. Dirk disappeared as he fell down and down, and the Jumpboat  began buck madly as the air made it's escape from the craft.<BR>----------------------------<P><BR>Dirk fell down and down towards the dying Diplomat, his target firmly in his sight. A prism blade extended from his mangled suit as he continued his rapid descent. The figure..the kidnapper was in his sights..almost there.<P>"GIVE HER BACK TO ME YOU FREAK!!!" He screamed as loudly as he could.<P>The 'freak' turned unconcerned and looked up to the falling elf.  Dirk seemed to slam into an invisible wall, he could feel his body igniting, as if every cell fo his body was encompassed by flames. His scream once again cut the night. Still screaming, Dirk was flung away back to the ocean.<P>The ocean was no salve to his burning flesh, the salty water increased his agony as it filled his numerous wounds, but that pain was nothing..it was not why he cried out..it was his that he was close..and failed..the last of strength began to taper, as he bobbed amongest the waves.<P>"Trini......"<BR>------------------------<P>"DIRK!!" Reyas cried as he watched the events unfold. Raziel below on the Diplomat, unsummoned the blade, and looked up to the faltering Jumpboat.<P>You will be spared now old friend, but be warned. Do not release the Void.<P>WHY!! After all you did! All you put me, Leylia and everyone through! I will not have Leylia's ambitions, dreams crushed because of you!<P>You have been warned. Old friend.<P>Raziel vanished into the night. Reyas, shuddered at this.<P>..Raziel. He had changed sides so many times..what was he up to now..Why? Why did he guide them to try to teach aout the Void, and then tell them not to...It doesn't make any sense....<P>Reyas put this aside for the moment and began to lower the battered Jumpboat down to the dying Diplomat, he got close as he could witout touching down. He knew that it had taken a huge beating, and would not fly  again once it landed.Working quickly he tossed out a rope ladder down to the deck and awaited for the trio to climb aboard. Annie, and then girl made it up inside of the craft, as Nall started up. Reyas called down to him.<P>"Hold on a sec Nall, we got to do a little fishing!"<P>"Huh!?!"<P>"That guy that got blasted a few seconds ago, we got to get him out of the water!"<P>"Oh. Okay!!"<P>"Hang on tight now!"<P>The Jumpboat dragged away from the Diplomat, Nall hanging on the bottom of the ladder, swinging around searching for the fallen friend. It took some time, but he soon found the half drowned elf. He grapped ahold of him, trying not to agravate the wounds and signalled to Annie and the girl to pull the ladder up. As they did, Reyas manned the Jumpboat and blasted it upwards and away.<P>Once they got him aboard, Annie began to care to his wounds, with what little medical supplies she had in her suit.<P>"So where too Granpa?"<P>"I don't know, but we have to pick somewhere close" He pointed to a gauge with a paw.<P>"With damage this thing has taken and as long as we have been flying, it doesn't have much juice in it."<P>"Well the closest city is Qeynos. And that is not going to work, we just sunk their flagship, there is going to be a huge bounty on us....say" He stared at Reyas a bit<P>"Don't even think about it!"<P>"Just a thought...if only we had some cash..."<P>"What?" Annie asked cutting in<P>"If we had some cash, we could go to Ell-Five."<P>"Ell-Five! That place! It's apalce for hooligans and other miscreants. Why would we go there?"<P>"Well' it is in shambles nowadays, but aside from Highpass Dock and Iceclad Marina, it's the only place big enough to repair an Airship."<P>"So....."<P>"We could use my Airhsip..that was if a certain person who shall remain nameless*cough* Granpa*cough* hadn't broken it."<P>"I did not!"<P>"Yes, you did!!!"<P>"You! You have an Airhip!"<P>"I just said that."<P>"How can you afford an Airhsip, those things are expensive!"<P>"I know, and really expensive to repair. That's why I was at SNG, to win money to fix it. But you ruined everything....speaking of which where is my money!!!"<P>"Um..at the Orphans of Freeport Foundation."<P>".....We are scewed..guess we have to go risk Qeynos."<P>"NO! Don't go there!"<P>"Why?"<P>"Because..um.....well....i'm not realy liked...."<P>"So?"<P>"I kinda of embarrased my dad a while back..and he kinda has alot of friends down in Qeynos..."<P>"I'll repeat my last statement. So?"<P>"..um..well.....You see..my full name is..um Anita Magnolia................Bayle."<P>"ANITA BAYLE!!!"<P>"Yeah.."<P>"You're the King's daughter!?!?! You're the little princess........wait a sec...Your family has got more money then half the world put together! Why'd you come steal it from me!!!"<P>"Cause it was fun."<P>Nall frowns  "....I hate you..."<P>"We''l if it makes you feel any better, the orphans of Freeport thank you."<P>Nall scowled"......I really hate you..."<P>"...You know, I still have my family Misa card. I think there is enough limit to fix your ship."<P><BR>Nall blinked and then hugged Annie. ".....I love you!..." The embrace was quickly broken up by the dark elf elf girl, who glared evilly at Annie and then hugged Nall.<P>"This reminds me.." Nall states, looking at the girl."What's your name?"<P>"Me..Lilith."<P>"Pretty name."<P>She grinned.<P>Reyas still on top of the console grumbled to himself, that Nall was getting all the attention. He paced slightly and by accident his tail brushed across Atwight, who had been laid on the console by Nall after scooping up Dirk. As his tail touched Atwight, he felt a famaliar sensation pass over him, a sensation long forgottten. famaliar but undescribable.<P>[You're Dragon.]<P>Yes. Who are you?<P>[Just a sword. ]<P>A telepathic sword is not just any old sword....Do you have a name<P>[Atwight]<P>Atwight...some how it seems famaliar..I can't put by finger on it..<P>[Of course, you don't have any fingers]<P>.....Smart alec...<P>Reyas switched his concentration back to the trio. "I'm setting the course to Ell-Five, we should be at the stratorbital in about 15 minutes. Good thing too, we only got 16 minutes of fuel."<P>The Jumpbaoat flared it's engines to maximum, to make the ascent to Ell-Five, as it ascended, the group made quick patchwork to the hole in the door, so it wouldn't decompress again at the higher altitude of Ell-Five. It wouldn't hold long, being just a plastic sheet, but it would be long enough.<BR>-----------------------------------<P>Several days later, after lavishly spending Annie's money, Nall's pride and joy was back in complete working order.As they waited for the Flight control in Ell-Five to cycle the Naked Elf to drop station. The band of companions discussed their next destination along with other items.<P>"I can't believe, you spent 4 million platinum fixing this piece of junk. Even for a airship, this thing is old! It looks like an old sailing ship with propellers! What a piece of sh-"<P>"Don't badmouth my ship!!! It maybe old-fashioned or even an antique maybe, but it is the fastest and most powerful craft in existence. It's my baby." Nall says prodly as he rubs and then hugs main mast of the ship.<P>"Hmph..I  still think it's a piece of junk.."<P>"I'll be more then happy to show you the way out." Nall says pointing to the fact, the Naked Elf had been cycled to the main lock and the ocean and clouds, far far below where just underneath.<P>Annie looks over and jumps "AHH! We are high!!Where's the ground!!"<P>"About 13 miles down."<P>"are you sure this thing works? "<P>"Ohh course, my ship is the best-" A small piece of the mast, Nall was leaning against comes off. "...there is.."<P>"oh lord.."<P>-Attention Vessel 4512 Designation: Naked Elf, please stand by for final cycling and cross lock. Air will be pumped out and mana field will be disengaged in T-minus 4 minutes.-<P>"Hey reminds me..Nall this thing is completly open air!!! We are going to suffocate way up here!!"<P>"You worry to much Annie, we will be fine. Trust me and trust the Naked elf." Another piece of the mast falls off<P>"We're going to die..."<P>On a set of boxes, Reyas still in his lower form, sits waiting for the Naked Elf to take off, conversing silently with Atwight.<P>[An interesting vessel. Your Grandson seems to have much affinity for it. ]<P>Understandable, besides me, this ship is all he has left. All of his family is gone.<P>[Dead?]<P>Some, some have just vanished...but the main reason he loves this ship so much, is because of the previous owner.<P>[Who?]<P>His mother, this ship belonged to her. Ruby Tayus, the greatest pirate ever to sail the seas or sky. The Naked Elf was hers, until the was captured..more like betrayed..by my own son, Nall's father, I'm afraid...and executed.<P>[Does he know?]<P>Not really, he knowss that someone in his mother's crew  betrayed her , but not that it was his father. He only knows that Azreal, just got up and left one day, leaving him all alone.<P>[So sad..]<P>Yes.....but he is happy, he has the Naked Elf and memories of the days when he was young sailing across the sky with his mother. Cannons firing, all that sort of good stuff.<P>[Does he aspire to become like her?]<P>Not to my knowledge. He just likes to sail the skys and go where ever the wind and the Elf takes him.<P>[How romantic]<P>Hmm...<P>[By the way, back at the Diplomat, it seemed like that attacker knew you. Did you know him?]<P>Yes...or at least I thought I did...I really don't understand him any more...and honestly I am too tired to try. I am getting very old.<P>[Bah, you are dragon. ageless, always in the prime of youth. Quite helpful in the wee hours don't you think?]<P>And I thought I was lecherous. Speaking of dragons, why is it I feel somethng famaliar from you? It's almost draconion..faint..but draconion.<P>[You just haven't had a female companion in while that's all. Prime of youth getting up again. Shamelessly bad pun intended]<P>Bah!<P>Theiir silent conversation, was broken as Nall signaled to everyone to come together to discuss their next plan of action. As he did so, Lilith began to talk, in fact the most she had said in the entire time they had known her.<P>"We must free Void, for all of...Nor...nor...this world. The ony way to do that, is to find the 5 keys, to Void. I only know of two. One is on Veeshan...we are not strong enough to fight her...., the second is in Fear."<P>Reyas shuddered at the thought of his fomer home 500 years ago, but gritted his teeth and entered the conversation.<P>"If we have to get something from the Plane of Fear..more then likely from Cazic-Thule. Then the best place to try would, be through his strongest disciples. There is only one place where that can be."<P>"Palsa" They all said together.<P>Dirk who was up and around, but not very active and not in the huddle,was just looking over the side rail, over heard the destination.<P>Palsa.....Maxim.....If he couldn't Trini back at the moment, then at least he could get Maxim..He held out his hand, and began to think about the chance to finally get revenge, his hand ignited into flames.<P>"Fire it up." He laughed.<P>-Naked Elf, cross lock is complete, releasing main clamps. Air evac wil began in T-minus 30 seconds. Point of No return has been passed, release system can not be overrided.-<P><BR>"Nall, are you sure this piece of junk will fly?'<P>"Yes,positive. And besides it's a litte late now for doubts" He pointed upward, the massive stratorbital Ell-Five loomed above them, the open sky to their left, right and bottom.<P>(Music Cue The Journey Begins : Final Fantasy 2 (American Numbering) )<P>The Naked Elf shuddered as it's old fashioned Gnomish clockwork engines began to start. The props in the fore and and aft of the ship began to whirl. Amazingly, the wind did not start to pick up as expected on the deck. The props chopped the air, rapidly gaining speed, and in a few sort moments, became almost invisible rotating at such a high speed.<P>-Air evac complete, mana field disabled. Cross-Locks will disengage in 5 seconds....4.....3...2......Elevator going down....1.-<P>The locks snapped off the Elf, it lurched slightly, but quickly righted and began to gently sail from underneath the immense Stratorbital. It movedd across the sky majestically, and began a gentle turn to the SouthWest...to Odus.<BR>--------------------------------------<P><BR>The man ran ad ran. He was all that was left, al that was left of the news crew. They had come to fin out about the disappearance of the some of the well known students of Palsa. Students, that mysteriously vanished after, joining some kindof cult. a cult that taught use of magicks and sorcerorcy. Ad other outdated practices, why any one would want to learn about mana , sorcery and demons was beyond him..or at least was 15 minutes ago. No he understood, his current state was a testament to that, the blood running down his face, stinging his eyes, the burns on his arms, his urine soaked pants. now he understood...not that it would do him any good.<P>He ran and ran, the door to end of the cult hall was almost in reach, he could see teh city lights, but he fell, a sharp pain had ripped through his right arm..or at least where there used to be a arm.<P>He screamed and screamed hoping some one would hear him..come save him and he was lucky some one did hear him. The most of the city did, and some one did come for him, but not to save him.<P>Flames seemed to seep from everywhere,from every crevice in the room, but amazingly, though the flames burned brightly,t he shadows did receed, but he couldn't be amzedby this he was too terrified. The flames circled around him, he could feel the awesome heat from it, the flames began to consolidate an in a moment, a fgure emrged out of the flames. Him....Maxim. the leader of the cult...the teacher of the old ways, the old ways of the shadows and Cazic-Thule.<P>Maxim began to speak in that cold distant voice. "You droppd this" His arm fell into his lap. He wanted to scream, but for some reason he was just too scared.Maxim laughe, it echoing monsteriously in the huge room. Chains leapt out of the darkness , encompassing the man by his arm and legs, and righted him.<P>"Run.." The man was scared and did not comply. "RUN!!!!' A chain shed across the mman's chest biting deep into his flesh, the man turned  and ran as fast he could. As ran and ran, closer and closer to the exit, he thought he saw the shadows move. he got closer, they moved again, he began to push harder, trying to gain more speed, but then he heard it. Hard breathing, then the sounds of paws slapping across the ground. it was getting closer..closer, it was getting cold. He screamed again, as something bit into his right legs, blood streamed, he felt him self being hoisted in the air and flung around like a doll. it shook him again and again, and eventually his leg came off. he skided across te grund, blood pouring, and he saw it. The shadows themselves where his assailant, the shadows had teeth, the shadows where getting closer. The shadows began ripping at his chest, she screamed and screamed for a long time and eventually he stopped and the light began to fde from his eyes, but the ripping continued for a long time<P><BR>As the slaughter contnued, Maxim in the center of room, assumed a lotus posiotn and smiled a the sight.<P>"Enjoy your meal, Pain."<P>And with one exhaling, his body went cold as death, his surrondings began to disappear and were replaced, by the Plane of Fear.<P>"You have done well, Maxim. For you service, I hav a reward for you."<P>"Him?"<P>"No, but this will bring him. Find the Maelstrom gate, and destroy Errolisi like you did Tunare."<P>"It will be done."<P>Maxim began a different comune, a one of rememberance. Memories began to pass over him until he came to the one of most use andpleasure. The army of Thule, the army of darkness, and the completle conquering of the Plane of Growth.<BR>---------------------<BR>End of This Chapter<BR>---------------------<P>Sneak Peek of Chapter 4 Tides of Darkness<BR>--------------------------<P>See through Maxim's eyes his rise to power, the army of Cazic-Thule and the demise of Tunare. All in the next exciting chapter of TSF:Sign of The Void.<P>-------------------------<P>And here is the sneak peek  <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"><BR>------------------------<BR>Many Misadventures of Fry<BR>---------------------------------<BR>Chapter 1 Fry, the thief.....er scout..<P>It was a dark and stormy night as many a tale begins. My beloved husband snuck through the hallowed halls of Felwithe his prize at hand, easily bypassing the guards and security measures, at only the tender age of 14. Which is very young, especially for an elf. Who's lifespan is measured in centuries, not decades like the humans that are likely to read this biography.<P>Well, I suppose I am jumping ahead of things aren't I? I guess I should let you in a on few details on the life of my husband and maybe if I feel like it a little about myself.<P>My husband, if you haven't guessed already is Fry as he likes to be called, though his birth name is Frydious Angus-Bilbao Menlore..though you can see why he just likes to be called Fry..his parents must have had some really good evergreen leaves when they named him..but I am wandering again. Well, to start things off Fry was one bedazzled and trained in the arts of theivery or also known as the roguish arts. Everyone, just like everyone else who weren't of his guild and specialty called him exactly that a rogue and theif, hm I can hear him now screaming to the heavans that he was not a rogue, he was Scout. A scout of the Goddess Tunare! Proud defender of Faydwer,  and scourge of evil.....though he just tended to blow up stuff and get chassed by Orcs and Brownies...but if you think about it , it's almost the same isn't it? Well, I am jumping ahead again..<P><BR>Let's see what is a good way to start....o yeah silly me, more about Fry. You see Fry was the son of Augustas Menlore a powerful Geomancer and Mariea Ali, one of Kelethin's scouts. Sadly though one day when Fry was only 6, his father disappeared..some say he was killed, some say he abandoned Mariea and Fry, but who really knows but him. Because of that Fry grew up in the company of rogues...scouts and like his mother sought to become a legend amoung the guild. He spent every waking moment learning eerything he could, honing his skills and masterng them. And at the tender age of 14 breaking al kinds of records, was given a test of passing.<P>Now as the name sounds, this test was designed to ensure only the best students, would become full members of the Scout's guild and learn the guarded secrets of Scouting. Because of his natural prowess, Young Fry was given the hardest Test everr given, he was to break into Felwithe Castle and remove 1 item of worth from the royal quarters. Simply put, he had to get past, the most heavily defended area in the known world and steal something from either the King's, the Queen's or the Princess's room. Not an easy task for any one, even for Fry. So to make it somewhat more fair and to test another student who was breaking records, Fry was partnered with a girl 2 years his senior by the name of Reverdone Moocienaga Dal Kampo Ciba or Rev for short...I think Fry's and Rev's parents shared the same stash..but any way I am drifting..<BR>-------------------------------------<P><BR>Smothered in the shadows, Fry peers out from the Guard Tower across the town square, looking for the best point of entry into Felwithe Castle. He sighed, he tiring of waiing on Rev, she was so slow when it came to scaling walls.<P>He gazed up at the stars and began to drift away, hewa kind of tired, i had been a really long week with all of the tests, but soon it will be all over. Soon he will ba ful member of the Scout's of Tunare. He will get his Cape and seal and he will be shown the guild's secret skills and most importantly, the secrets of tracking. Maybe finally armed with that knowledge, he could fnd Pop. Finally,he would know why he leftso suddenly....why he left Mo-<P>Ahand touched his shoulder.<P>"Fry."<P>"AAAAHH!!" He shouted nearly jumping out of his skin. "Don't do that Rev!"<P>The young Wood Elf girl scooted up beside him and crouched upon thee tower edge, giving him a quick smile. <P>"You are such a scardy-cat Fry." SHe giggled and brushed her flowing hair back bit, in doing so she released a bit of even from Fry. As she reached up, she inadvertently moved er cloak, reveaing her Scout knife. He envied that so, he wanted a Scout Knife also and he would have had it f it weren't for his reluctance in combat. Not to say that he was a poorly skilled fighter, even his Guildmaster had to admit that Fry was rapidly becoming better he was. It was just that Fry could never, no matter the circumstances or the imagined scenarios given to him by his teachers, could he strike what would be a fatal blow. It was because of that, he would never get a scout's knife, the Scout symbol of absolute deadliness.<P>He quickly pushed that thought aside, and focused back onthe mission. <P>"Let's go" He pulled his cloak back over him and leapt of the high guard tower. Rev mimiced him and for a few countless seconds they fell down and down until they landed like cats upon thestraw thatchel roof of a peasant home. They both dashed forward, quickly getting up to a fast klip, dashing across the roof and then leaping to the next roof. Playing a silent game of leapfrog across the roofs of the inhabtants below.<P>Quickly and silently, thay made it to Felwthe castle. Where they rendevouzed once again, in the shadows just beyond the sight of the porticullis Gaurds.<P>Rev scanned up, and began to thread a lin through her grappling hook.<P>"You still use that clunky thing?"<P>"Yeah."<P>"Why not just run up like we where taught?"<P>"I can't do it, I keep slipping."<P>"How dd you pass teh climbing test?"<P>"Patience, a friend and 30 platinum coins." she beamed<P>"Hmph.. ANy way, lets do this witha little style."<P>"How?"<P>"Straight through the front entrance?"<P>"How? There is no where to hid, to get around them. To much light." She said referring to the 15 torchs spread around the entrance.<P>It was Fry's turn to beam. "Watch and learn, little one" He said imitating the Guild leader. He removed two throwing daggers from his utility pouch and a bottle of fluid. He quickly dippd the daggers in the fluid and then put the bottle back in the pouch. Moving away a bt to get a better angle, he lined up and then hurled the daggers at the two guards. Each one striking a guard just at the seam beween their platemail armor.<P>The guards looke pained for a moment, then collapsed backwards and began to snore.<P>"What was that?"<P>Fry, took the bottle back out and let Rev smeel the what was in it. She coughed and smileda bit. "Evergreen leaf elixer"<P>"Yeah, When you need something great for parties and knocking out inept castle guards, I highly recommend it. Heh, they are going to wake up feeling like a million platinum. And they are going to need it too, when the King chews them out for letting us get past so easily."<P><BR>.... to bee continued..<P><BR>-Razy D.
