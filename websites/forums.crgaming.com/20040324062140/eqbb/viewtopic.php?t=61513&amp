Maybe it wasn't, All I know is that He is long gone now.  I never understood what that saying was supposed to mean... I mean, if I wanted something... wouldn't I make it happen?  If I wanted love...If I wanted Death... Couldn't I make it happen?
<br />

<br />
	Over the years I have written and written stories... Songs, poems, and even prayers to entertain or uplift the spirits of the norrathian peoples. Many know of me... but more don't. They know me as Lady Silverheart and many other names. I have brought people wisdom... some amusement... but mostly... I brought myself Destruction. Each time I write I pour myself into my creations, Only to watch them die... to faulter...to wilt in the heat of criticts and sometimes, Lately to bloom into glorious flowers of multipul colors only to die in a rotting stinking mass because I tried to hurry it to it's full glory!  
<br />

<br />
-Suljiness sighs deeply lifting her wine glass to her lips  then lifts a reasureing smile to the crowd and continues her tale-
<br />

<br />
The fate of this tale will end the same if you try to hurry me. Maybe it shall take a month or two... But would you hurry a great bard in singing the tale of a Knight who bravely killed many to save his lords kingdom? Would you hurry the tale of Romance? Of Great Sacrafices? Would you hurry the tale.... of Demons and Angels or Kings and their kingdoms? Or peasents and their even greater and more humble kingdoms? Would you tear apart a tapestry of Gold and silver threads that had taken you your life to compleat...
<br />

<br />
All stories start from the begining... and to keep the listeners listening you must catch them from the begining.
<br />

<br />
I was once worse off then anyone in this room...
<br />

<br />
-Calls of laughter and "yeah right's" fill the room, suljiness stares at everyone  calmly, her face blank and emotionless, waiting for the room to calm down-
<br />

<br />
I was born... In the wars that pushed the First born elves from their true homelands in what is now known as freeport, You see originally humans were born and bred... lived solely in Qeynos! No where else... but they were greedy for more... and they populated very fast, so to solve a problem... they moved to what is now freeport as I said. 
<br />

<br />
-raises her head, stareing at the smoke stained cealing letting her memories take controle. Every liveing being stoped their talking,  everyone stoped their movements, all raised their heads to stare at the nameless story teller.-
<br />

<br />
	It was a great bloody war... I can hear my people screaming... Calling for help... Crying out for their gods to save them... their gods who they loved for centuries before the humans came... But their civilization died in a great burning... And great wooden ships who's white sails were like the doves wings to freedom Flying them to a great new land where Tunares' influence was greatest... And what did they find there? Orcs! The blue skinned cousins of the Deathfist clans...They slaughtered many more of the few left...
<br />

<br />
	And I was never able to help them, because my masters... No not my mother nor my father... I never had one. I was raised in slavery... Beaten each time I did something they didn't like... said something that they didn't agree with. I never found out why until the day the thought i was old enough to go... or rather... They day they knew they were dieing... Finally.
<br />

<br />
	My  grandfather was a Demon... A man named Daemon. He had powers to possess people, great powers of destruction... but the best of these powers... the one I had enheritated from him... the powers to change form into a Large black bird. My grandfather mated with a High elf... Supriseingly though... This was not a forced union... the It was due to deceit and trickery. The demon possessed her husband, and his seed gave my mother birth.
<br />

<br />
From that union lady Silvestriss Dae Domina`Luna Iceleaf was born... My mother. 
<br />

<br />
	She had traveled alone for many years...  and somehow she found a Dark elf... and this darkelf.. Somehow, even though he followed Innoruuk had found love, and grew to love her. His name was Kasardack Infereques.  My background came as a shock to me... I had heared of the great Silvestriss...as well as the Dark Knight favored by Innoruuk named Kasardack. To know I was in fact their only child.......
<br />
It's only fair to say... that I was shocked.
<br />

<br />
The day I was given my freedom was the day my masters all died from old age. I stayed at their bedside, wondering why I held the most cruel of my masters' hand...  It was him who gave me my freedom... and the words I spoke to you at the begining.
<br />
"That life isn't what you want it to be... but what you make it...Suljiness Domina`Mortis Iceleaf..." he told me in a broken whisper... After that he told me my past, his tale lasted through the night and the moment the sun broke through the colored glass windows he told me that I was now a free woman... Appologized... and Died.
<br />

<br />
-Sulji looks up through the Inn's stained glass windows just as the dawn starts shineing through.-
<br />

<br />
I shall tell you more.... After we all get our rest... And if You wish to hear the story or My Life... 
<br />

<br />
The story...
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-style: italic"><span style="font-weight: bold"> The Travels of Kyarra the princess of the Elven race, Suljiness the Lost soul, Yakov the cold heart and wonderous sword skills that hid his true self, Dominis the Son of Erollisi Marr... her Avatar.... Shandria the wood elf fighter of great skill, Xaph...my true master... the immortal ever dying... And many others....</span></span>

<br />
Yes... i truely know all of these people.... Comment please... tell me if I should continue... or stop.

<br />
Suljiness finishes her story for the night and is walking off the stage, a man comes to meet her, this man wears a long white robe. He says “You know Sulji, you never told me your life story in all the years we’ve known each other, of course, well… neither have I. 
<br />

<br />
   “Who are you?” Sulji asks.
<br />

<br />
    “I can’t believe you don’t remember or maybe I’ve changed.” The man says, “Fine I will show you” He pulls down his hood and Sulji is staring into the face of Dominus. 
<br />

<br />
   “You know how hard it is to track you down, don’t answer that question, please.”
<br />

<br />
   “Claudius??” Sulji says stunned. She hugs him tightly.
<br />

<br />
   “Yeah, long time no see. I’ve spent the better part of three years trying to track you down.” 
<br />

<br />
   “ Sorry ‘bout that.” Sulji says apologetically
<br />

<br />
   “No problem, I just have one question, how could you tell a tale you have not heard, I think I should tell my story, with your introduction if you don’t mind.”
<br />
(Warning: shifting from third person to first)
<br />
   
<br />
   The next evening I sit down and eat well and await Sulji’s arrival. When she finally arrives she gets up on stage and says. “We have a special guest who is going to tell his own story on my behalf. Hailing from Mount Olympus, Greece, also known as the planes of power to us Norrathians, an old friend of mine, Claudius, once known as Dominus Gladiorum”
<br />

<br />
   Dominus steps on to the stage and people shout, “He’s no god”
<br />

<br />
   “You’re asking for it.” I say as I remove the shield protecting others from the heat that is my power, the people sitting closest to the stage back away from the stage. With that the audience shouts “okay maybe he is. 
<br />
	
<br />

<br />
   “ My full name is Kaeso Claudius Gallicus. I was born to, using Greek names, Aphrodite, the goddess of love, and Ares, the god of war. To you Norrathians they would be called Erolissi Marr and Rallos Zek, but as we have different mythos they are two different sets of gods. For about a year I was made to assist my mother in toying with the hearts of mortals. One day my mother came to me and told me exactly where I could find a particular woman who she was jealous of, I was to make her fall in love with either a donkey or the ugliest man in Athens, but when I got to the predetermined place she was asleep with her back to me, just as I was about to poke her with the tip of the arrow, she rolled over and I saw why my mother was jealous, her beauty was comparable to my mother’s (Aphrodite is the most beautiful woman on earth). Her beauty stunned me and I dropped my arrow on my foot making me fall head over heals in love for her. I find out a few days later that her name is Domitia Lucilla but while in Greece she was called Dionysia. During the next year I could think of nothing but Dionysia, Until Hepheastus, god of smiths, realized that I was not his child then he had Zeus, king of gods, throw me off Olympus, which he did reluctantly as I was like a son to him, always making sure that Hera, his wife, did not find out about his latest round of philandering. This begins my life on earth, the second part of the four part story that is my life."
<br />

<br />
I finish as the sun rises and say  "Like my friend Lady Suljiness, I must now leave, I have one or two things to take care of on Olympus, my story will continue two days from now.."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

Then I open my backpack and remove a conical flower, drink the nectar inside and eat the petals. Shortly thereafter Sulji walks in to the pub, and turns toward the bar, and sits down in the stool next to me. 
<br />

<br />
   “The gods of Earth and Norrath want you to join them. They want to make the Protector of Norrath a position held by a god, and they want that god to be you. Do you accept?” I ask seriously.
<br />

<br />
   “Would I still serve you?” Sulji responds curiously.
<br />

<br />
   “Yes and no, I would still be above you in the Hierarchy of the gods, yes. But you would not have to serve me if you did not want to.” I explain.
<br />

<br />
   “I accept.” Sulji answers
<br />

<br />
   “Then after I finish my story we will go to the planes and to Olympus so that gods on both sides witness your ascension.” I say this. With that I walk up onto the stage and start telling the second part of my story. 
<br />

<br />
   “When I arrived on earth I still had the gifts given to me at birth by my mother and father. My mother’s gift was the capacity to feel the pleasures, pains and feelings of others. My father gave me the gift to be able to use any weapon I picked up with a skill greater than that of an expert but not quite a master. I arrived in Gaul and lived in a small town on the north-north-east side of the country, I was taken in by a family that differed from me in more ways than I can mention. After completing the right of manhood, that had me recognized as a man in their culture, I was given this dagger.” He draws it and shows it too all, then continues. “The blade is dipped in a poison made by the blood of the Golden Hind, A half woman, half deer, whose blood is potent enough to kill a god, and once it is placed on a weapon it will not come off. I started training to be a Holy Knight, and was on a quest that took me to Greece where I had to retrieve a sword that was stolen from my family. The sword was in the possession of Dionysia, the woman I was head over heels in love with. I heard Eros laugh as he shot her with an arrow very similar to the one I dropped on my foot. I returned with both the sword and Dionysia, we were married about six months later.” I say making eye contact with Sulji. “A few years later while I was returning from the test called the right of rising, the final test that must be passed to make one a Holy Knight in my world, I found my family slaughtered, all except my wife. After performing the burial rights for my family I went in search of those who killed them. When I found them my normally calm peaceful demeanor changed I was furious I managed to kill fifteen of the twenty five men, then a man with a large plank knocked me unconscious, and I was shackled up next to my wife. When I awoke we were in a large house. She was being yelled at by an older man who said some thing like ‘why didn’t you return, that is disobeying a direct order from the roman senate, which warrants treason. You will be put to death now.’ They tied her to a post and an archer put an arrow through her throat. Again the rage built, and the chains holding me broke, I snapped the arm of one of the guards and took his sword, then killed him, his partner, and my wife’s father, and was about an inch off when it came to the archer, at whom I launched the gladius, it imbedded itself in the mans shoulder deep enough  that the wound would never completely heal. Then for a second time I was knocked unconscious, by the praetorians who responded to the shouts of the archer. This ends the second part of the four part story that is my life.
<br />

<br />
Again I finish as the sun rises, and say " I will continue in two days"</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">The next two days pass and I return to the pub. As I step onto the stage the audience cheers. I look out into the audience and see Sulji sitting in the first row of people, and smile. “This is a disclaimer, if you are a bit squeamish please leave now, the next section of my life is the gladiatorial section and the part after that is the time I spent in the Roman Military. These sections are rather violent.” I warn.  A few women left with their dates, leaving only one or two women left. 
<br />

<br />
“With that said I will continue my story, When I awoke I was in a iron cage with a big guy staring down on me, ‘well our new guy is finally awake, time to train’ the man said. I was released and taken out to the practice field where I had to stand in line for ranking either red or yellow, red being the better of the two. When it came to be my turn they tossed a wooden sword my way, and told me to parry and strike back. For an hour and a half I parried and did no more. After the Hour and a half they tied me to a tree and each other man had one chance to hit me, all fifty men took the opportunity to. The man who was running the training camp asked if I was going to cooperate, I nodded yes and he cut me down. The big man who was acting as the tester swung at me again, I parried and drove the blade in to his side a sickening crunch was heard by all. A physician examined him and said that I shattered four of the poor man’s ribs almost driving them into a lung. I was given a yellow rank because I would not cooperate. One week later I was put into a gladiatorial match in which a few others and I were pitted against three chariot teams. Of the fifteen men that we had only five survived, the sandy floor of the arena was drenched in blood. The next match I was put in, I was made to fight against an undefeated champion, I guess it was to get me back for hospitalizing their best gladiator. The fight lasted from sun up to about noon, you see there’s no draw in a gladiatorial fight, I won but not with out taking a few bad cuts” I say as I take off my scale shirt and show my scarred back and chest then replace my shirt and motion to the deep scar on my face from the lower lid of my eye down to my chin. “It was in that fight that I earned my arena name Dominus Gladiorum, because I showed sheer skill with all weapons that were available to my use. Most of my gladiatorial career went similarly fight here and win with scars here and there. Until the last fight of my career, where the ****y son of an emperor decided to challenge me with the added danger of lions and tigers to harm us. He would slash and I would parry then I would slash and he would parry, he slashed my left arm and blood sprayed over the east wall of the arena’s, we continued and I slashed his right arm and again blood spatter was visible on the wall. The fight went on like this for a while a tiger caught me in the right leg when I killed it in self defense my face was splattered with blood he tried to take advantage of my prone position by attempting to thrust the blade of his sword into my chest, but I reacted to quickly with circular parry and ended up putting the blade through his throat. If I wasn’t already drenched in blood the blood pouring out of his carotid artery and jugular vein finished the job. He was the only important man I killed in my career. I thought when the emperor came down to talk to me he was going to sentence me to death but instead he congratulated me and granted me my freedom, but requested that I lead a large portion of his army, the largest being a legion, I was in control of a small army of four legions. This is the beginning of my military career and the end of the third section of my life.
<br />
And for your information in my career as a gladiator I killed sixty seven thousand eight hundred fifty nine men and probably killed one hundred thousand lions, tigers, bears, giraffes, and aligators.</span><span class="gensmall"><br /><br />Last edited by Dominus Gladiorum on Sat Oct 05, 2002 3:58 am, edited 1 time in total</span></td>

 I walk up the stairs to the stage and the audience cheers, I bow recieving the complements humbly. Once the noise has died down some I start the final part of my story. "My military career started with me and my small army of one leigon supressing barbarian revolts along the Rhine river, which acts as a border to the still unromanized frontier that is Garmania. To give you a picture of how violent these battles were *points to a barbarian warrior in the pub and gestures for him to come up on stage* this is the size of men we were fighting except there were thousands of them where he is only one. They prefered to weild axes and large swords that were later called Claidhemores (Claymores for those who have never seen the gaelic spelling). we would often meet along the hills of a valley one army on each side. The only thing that allowed us to even come close to winning these confrontations was out catapults and balistae, Which we fired as they charged to meet us. Then our archers loosed their arrows and we soon after charged in to the fray ourselves on the way launching our javelin-like spears. We would slaughter masses and they would still come back for more. While I was giving a rallying speach to my men, I heard the soft voice of Aphrodite, my mother, saying that I was needed more on Norrath than on Warth and that my army would be looked after by Athena (goddess of wisdom and war). At which time I appeared in the depths of Najeena, where I met Yakov and Kyarra and many more whose stories are sung by your bards, yet Sulji and I are the only ones who will know how this story ends. I bid thee fare well" *I approach Sulji and we vanish in an intermingled burst of white light and menacing red flame.
<br />
  
<br />
In a place between the palaces of the gods of both worlds, all gods come together to greet the newest member of their family. Sulji is overcome with the knowledge and power bestowed apon a god and she faints as she recovers I am carrying her to the Palace I had specially built for her right next door to mine with a coridor joining them, so that we can get to each other rapidly (if needed or desired). Her palace was built in the style of the Temple of Zeus at the acropolis in black marble. The giant door had handles of gold. The couch I set her down upon was of the softest down feathers able to be found in either world. As she drifted back off to sleep I whispered "Sleep darling, alow your mind to accept what just happened, tommorow it won't be so bothersome."
