									<br>
									<u>Brother Qwinn</u><br>
									<br>
									Find and Hail Brother Qwinn in South Karana. Brother Qwinn is not a permanent spawn, and is a rare wandering NPC. A tracker in the form of a Druid or Ranger is extremely useful in tracking him down, and most Monks at this stage offer rewards for him to be held for them. The only thing that can be confirmed about his path is the fact that he wanders past Paw and towards the aviak village, with the rest of his route being random.<br>
									<br>
									Brother Qwinn says 'In the name of the [Brotherhood of the Lost Circle] I greet you.<br>
									<br>
									Ask 'What is the Brotherhood of the Lost Circle?'<br>
									<br>
									Brother Qwinn says 'The [Monks of the Whistling Fist] are called the Lost Circle by others. We are an ancient league of monks. Long forgotten and few remaining. Within this realm there are only two. I and [Brother Zephyl]. We seek the items stolen from us. I seek the [Code of Zan Fi].<br>
									<br>
									Ask 'What is the Code of Zan Fi?'<br>
									<br>
									Brother Qwinn says 'The tome called the Code of the Whistling Fist has been stolen from me. It contains many secrets pertaining to our brotherhood. Thankfully it is magically locked and only a Zan Fi master could unlock it. I quest for a monk to retrieve it. Would you be an [interested monk].<br>
									<br>
									Say 'I am an interested monk!'<br>
									<br>
									Brother Qwinn says 'Then venture into the depths beyond the great Solusek Mining Company. There, living among the Kobolds, will be Targin the Rock.Get the book from him and return here and wait for my reappearance. When we meet again you shall hand me the book and a Purple Headband earned from the Silent Fist Clan. Do so and you shall be closer to joining the brotherhood.<br>
									<br>
									<u>Targin the Rock</u><br>
									<br>
									The code is dropped by Targin the Rock, who is approximately a 39th level Monk, in the Solusek B King Room. He is an uncommon spawn rather than rare, and is probably only slightly rarer than the Kobold King.<br>
									<br>
									The King spawns to the right of the Throne, and Targin on the left, so they do not share the same spawn point.<br>
									<br>
									He hits for around 80 damage. Although he is supposed to be tougher than Raster, this room within Sol B much more likely to be camped than the Mino Room in Lower Guk, and so there will be lots of people on hand to help, either from the King Room, or from a group taking the Priest or Champion rooms.<br>
									<br>
									<u>Qwinn Again</u><br>
									<br>
									Returning the Code of Zan Fi, plus the Purple Headband to Brother Qwinn, will result in you getting the Needle of the Void, and the following conversation.<br>
									<br>
									Brother Qwinn says 'We had an agreement. The proof of a skilled monk, the purple Headband, and the Code of the Whistling Fist.<br>
									<br>
									Brother Qwinn says 'We thank you for the return of the Code of the Whistling Fist. Take this sewing needle. You shall find it useful should you aid [Brother Zephyl] in his quest. His item, the needle, a swatch of shadow silk and a scroll containing Jonathan's Whistling Warsong. Into a sewing kit they will be going. And into the brotherhood will you. I hope you do not wish me to [return the headband]..<br>
									<br>
									If you wish him to return the headband, he says:<br>
									<br>
									Brother Qwinn says 'Then you will return that which was earned or the robe.<br>
									<br>
									<u>Brother Zephyl</u><br>
									<br>
									The other Monk, Brother Zephyl, is in the Rathe Mountains. He, like Brother Qwinn also has placeholders and is not a static spawn, but a rare NPC. His placeholders are confirmed as Hasten Bootstruter (for the Journeymans Boots quest), a drake, and a mid 30's Ranger called Maldyn the Unkempt. If you are unlucky to find Hasten up, and do not have the manpower to kill him, he apparently despawns in 2 to 4 hrs. Maldyn was easily bested by a 45th Monk with Haste, but he has a damage shield up, so fight with fists rather than low delay weapons, else you will do his job for him. The PH is a 20ish minute spawn.<br>
									<br>
									Hail Brother Zephyl!<br>
									<br>
									Brother Zephyl says: Greetings. I am one with the [lost circle]. You have found me. What is it you desire?<br>
									<br>
									What lost circle?<br>
									<br>
									Brother Zephyl says: The [monks of the whistling fist] are called the lost circle by others. We are an ancient league of monks. Long forgotten and few remaining. Within this realm there are only two. I and [Brother Qwinn]. We seek the items stolen from us. I seek the [Idol of Zan Fi].<br>
									<br>
									What is the Idol of Zan Fi?<br>
									<br>
									Brother Zephyl says: The idol of Zan Fi is a sacred totem to our brotherhood. I cannot share it's secrets, but I can offer to you a reward for its return. Are you an [interested monk]?<br>
									<br>
									I am an Interested monk!<br>
									<br>
									Brother Zephyl says: Then venture to the lands of evil. The swamps of Trolls and Ogres, there will seek a monk called Raster. He has the idol. You will return here and wait for my reappearance. When we meet again you shall hand me the idol and a Red Sash earned from the Ashen Order. Do so and you shall be closer to joining the brotherhood.<br>
									<br>
									Brother Zephyl wants the Idol of Zan Fi, which is in the possession of Raster of Guk, who is a very rare spawn, near the Mino Elders room in Lower Guk.<br>
									<br>
									Returning the Idol and the Red Sash to Brother Zephyl, will earn you the Rare Robe Pattern.<br>
									<br>
									Shadow Silk is tailored using the following components:<br>
								</font></p>
							<ul>
								<li><font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">A Shadow Wolf Pelt (not a ruined pelt from a Shadow Wolf)<br>
									</font>
								<li><font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">A Silk Swatch (easily made from two spider silks)<br>
									</font>
								<li><font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">A Scroll of Gather Shadows.<br>
									</font>
							</ul>
							<p><font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The silk is supposed to be moderately hard to make, and a skill of 50 in Tailoring will only give you a 50% chance of making the swatch, but I made a swatch first time with a Tailoring skill of 26.<br>
									<br>
									The Gather Shadows Scroll is found in a Necro guild and Johnathons Whistling Warsong from a Bard Guild.<br>
									<br>
									You should now have 4 items, the Needle of the Void, the Rare Robe Pattern, the Shadow Silk, and a Scroll of Jonathans Whistling Warsong.<br>
									<br>
									Place all the four items in a Large Sewing kit, and hit combine. This will result in the creation of the Robe of the Lost Circle. You do not require a tailoring skill for the Robe, assuming someone makes you the Shadow Wolf Pelt.<br>
									<br>
									<b><u>Robe of the Whistling Fists</u></b><br>
									<br>
									You need to speak to 'Brother Balatin', who is a skeletal Monk on the pyramid in the giant wizard spires within the Dreadlands in Kunark. The giant spires are located at the far end of the zone, where the Druid rings are.<br>
									<br>
									He has a Plaguebone Skeleton as a place holder and the respawn is approximately 6 minutes. Brother Balatin despawns after approximately 30 mins.<br>
									<br>
									He is KOS to all and needs an enchanter or Necro to charm him, otherwise he will attack you. He will still be scowling, but will talk to you and accept the items required. He must be Charmed, not mezzed, and it is advisable for the 'charmer' not to be a Bard, as the Bards Charm is pulse based, and breaks and recharms every 9 secs or so. Balatin breaks charm quicker than a normal NPC would (and you have a lot to lose,) so it is best to be on the safe side.<br>
									<br>
									Hail Brother Balatin.<br>
									<br>
									Say 'I follow the Brotherhood of the Lost Circle'<br>
									<br>
									Brother Balatin says 'Then we are one. The rebirth of our circle shall start with you. I have waited decades for your arrival. You should seek the living brothers within Tunaria. When you have earned your garb then you will be ready for the true drape.<br>
									<br>
									Say 'I am ready for the true drape'<br>
									<br>
									Brother Balatin says 'Seek the broken flute of our master. Taken from us by the Iksar twins of Vistrei. To me they will come and to me your robe and to you will come the dawning of the new brotherhood.<br>
									<br>
									<u>Iksar Betrayer - Chardok</u><br>
									<br>
									The Iksar Betrayer is a level 57 Mob, who hits for 170+. It is recommended to have a full group of 54+ if attempting this.<br>
									<br>
									The timer for the Betrayer place holder and other surrounding mobs is approx 16 mins with the Bridge Keeper and Ancient on a slightly different timer.<br>
									<br>
									He drops 'A Metal Pipe', which when identified, shows as 'Fi'<br>
									<br>
									<u>Drolvarg Pawbuster - Karnors Casle</u><br>
									<br>
									The Pawbuster also drops 'A Metal Pipe', identical (in appearance) to the one dropped by the Betrayer. This piece identifies as 'Zan'<br>
									<br>
									<u>Completion</u><br>
									<br>
									When the two pieces of pipe, along with your Robe of the Lost Circle, are handed in to the charmed Brother Balatin you are presented with the Robe of the Whistling Fist,<br>
									<br>
									<b><u>Celestial Fists</u></b><br>
									<br>
									Hail Tomekeeper Dahl on the second floor of the Erudin Library and say 'What rare finds?'<br>
									<br>
									Tomekeeper Danl says 'Yes, any rare books, tomes, essays, or other literature you find may be of interested to me. Although the finds I am interested in are quite high profile and would most likely only be found in the possession of very powerful or influential beings. Give me what you have found and I will pay you what it is worth to us.<br>
									<br>
									The book he requires is called the book of Immortals, a book found in Skyfire. It drops from any of the following - 'Soul Devourer' , 'lava walker' , 'Black Scar', 'a wandering wurm', 'a Shadow Drake', 'Guardian of Felia', or any other of the named mobs there.<br>
									<br>
									Giving Tomekeeper Dahl the Book of Immortals, prompts the following:<br>
									<br>
									Tomekeeper Danl gasps at the sight of the rare book and says, 'This is a great find indeed! I can only imagine who you had to.. persuade to give you the book. Our library would be very interested in acquiring this and I am prepared to give you this platinum and a referral that marks you as a friend of the library. If only [Lheao] could see this.'<br>
									<br>
									Who is Lheao?'<br>
									<br>
									Tomekeeper Danl says 'Lheao was my predecessor here at the Library of Erudin. He has since retired, just a few years ago. I'm sure he would be most impressed with your find and offer insightful conversation on the subject. Although I'm not sure one of your profession would be interested in such a scholarly endeavor, no offense. If you are interested, find him and tell him you found the book 'Immortals.' I'm not sure where he has retired to, but I hear it is near an ocean somewhere.<br>
									<br>
									He gives you a piece of paper, Danl's reference, which identifies as 'Paper with the Erudin Library Seal'<br>
									<br>
									Lheao is found in the Timerous Deep in the hidden oasis. To reach it, take the boat from Fironia Vie, and jump off as it turns towards the South East, and continue swimming South. The loc is approximately neg 11500, neg 2000, where you will run into a huge rock wall that is a huge ring of solid rock. There is an underwater tunnel, which goes under this wall, at approx neg 11357 neg 3657.<br>
									<br>
									Once through that tunnel, you surface and see another huge rock. This second huge rock has another tunnel, (at loc -11354, -1365) which is at the opposite side to where you entered. This finally leads you to the hidden oasis, where you see a ramp leading to an inn, where Lhaeo stands outside.<br>
									<br>
									Hail Lhaeo and say 'I have found the book Immortals'<br>
									<br>
									Lheao looks up at you, eyes wide in astonishment, and says, 'My god, you found 'Immortals'?! Where did you find it? Never mind, that is unimportant. I have in my possession a book that explains more about these individuals.<br>
									<br>
									Its value is unimaginable as well as the impact it is capable of. As you can see, I grow old. I need an individual to watch over this book and make sure it is protected. Would you be willing to [take this responsibility]?'<br>
									<br>
									Say 'I will take this responsibility'<br>
									<br>
									Lheao says 'I'm sorry, Kage , but I could only give this book to a true master, such as a member of the Whistling Fists Order. And unless you can give me proof that you are one, in addition to Danl's reference, which is very unlikely, there is no way I'll let you take charge of [the Celestial Fists].<br>
									<br>
									Say 'What Celestial Fists?'<br>
									<br>
									Lheao says 'The Celestial Fists is the title of a book written by an unknown author. His writing is sub par but the legend is interesting from a biographical standpoint alone. Its rarity commands top dollar in the scholarly community but the secrets revealed in the book are what truly makes it dangerous. I've thought many times to destroy it but just couldn't. I hope I'm able to find someone to watch over it soon.<br>
									<br>
									Once the Robe of the Whistling Fists and Dahl's reference are handed in, you receive a Celestial Fists book.<br>
									<br>
									<u>Kaiaren</u><br>
									<br>
									The next step is to see someone called Kaiaren, who is located at Loc -1609, -2679, just as you come into the upper Sebilis Ruins in Trakanons Teeth. He may be slightly off this location, as he chases Monks and does not return to his original spawn point.<br>
									<br>
									'Hail Kaiaren and then hand him the book Celestial Fists. He will attack you. After killing him he says 'Not bad.. Now lets see if you can find my trueform if you do we discuss this further.'<br>
									<br>
									You do not need to kill Kaiaren, as giving him the book and feigning him off works fine. He is 52nd level, and hits for 145 damage.<br>
									<br>
									Either way, you will recieve the Celestial Fists book back into your inventory.<br>
									<br>
									The next step is to find Kaiaren's true form, which spawns when the book is given to the mad Kaiaren. He is also called Kaiaren and is also located in Trakanons Teeth near the lake. He spawns at approx 300, 2400 in a building next to the lake. He is level 60+ and indifferent. When you hand him the book, he says the following:<br>
									<br>
									Kaiaren says 'Now, then. Where did you find this, monk? This is not just some light reading to be borrowed from the town library. Who gave this to you?<br>
									<br>
									Say 'I got it from Lheao'<br>
									<br>
									Kaiaren says 'Hmmm, never heard of him. Well, it doesn't matter, the book is here now. Curse that idiot for writing it in the first place. Not even sure why I let him stick around. If you ever see that clown monk Aradiel kick him in the shins for me! At any rate, I suppose you'd like to find the Fists and [have a nice chat with them], eh? Their master owes me much. I would reward you well if you were to bring me proof of the master's defeat'<br>
									<br>
									Say 'I would like to have a nice chat with them'<br>
									<br>
									Kaiaren says 'Yes, I suppose you would. All you children looking for fame and glory will eventually learn the poison of ambition. But how will you find them? They are able to meld with their elements seamlessly and they certainly have no interest in fooling with the likes of you. No, you will need to get their attention. Fortunately, I know [how you can do this].<br>
									<br>
									Say 'How can I do this?'<br>
									<br>
									Kaiaren says, 'My guess is that the weakest of the Fists will be the easiest to draw out. He is egotistical and arrogant. How he came to master the Discipline of Fire, I do not know. He will most likely be in another form, one of his element. When you find the one you believe to be the Fist, you must challenge him. If you use his true name, Eejag, in your formal challenge, he will respond. A flame can burn intensely but it cannot last for long. Know this when you battle him.<br>
									<br>
									He hands you back the book, and it has now changed from the 'Celestial Fists' to the 'Book of Celestial Fists' as shown.<br>
									<br>
									Important Note: Now the Book has been returned to you, and as shown, it is NOT the same. The properties of this book have now been changed. Do not hand this book over again until the final stage, as he will expect the demon fangs as well.<br>
									<br>
									<b><u>The Celestial Fists</u></b><br>
									<br>
									<u>Eejag</u><br>
									<br>
									In Lavastorm, there is an wandering Imp, larger than the others, called 'a fire Sprite'. The sprite is pretty common and travels from the druid ring to the southeast and back again. He is a very low Level imp (approximately 14th level). If Eejag is already spawned he won't shout to the zone when you say the challenge to the sprite.<br>
									<br>
									To initiate the sequence, hail the Fire Sprite with: 'I Challenge Eejag'<br>
									<br>
									The fire sprite disappears and the zone gets a message...<br>
									<br>
									Eejag shouts What imbecile dares challenges a Celestial Fist?! Do you even know who you are challenging? HA! You are nothing but an insect! I will enjoy crushing you, I have not charred the flesh of an idiot in decades! If you truly wish to fight me, the battle shall be held in my own element. Come, challenger, come down to the pits of flowing fire.<br>
									<br>
									The 'pits of flowing fire' is the large pool of lava by the Solesek's. At Loc 1061, 248, -132, roughly under the middle smoke plume, an Iksar will be swimming. He is Level 55, and hits for a maximum of 157. Eejag is rooted to his spawn spot. He cons indifferent, so it is possible to gather round him beforehand. When you get summoned, you appear on the bottom of the lake directly beneath him, where he can hit you, but you cant hit him. He can summon you regardless of if you are in the lava or not.<br>
									<br>
									Once killed, he drops nothing but the Charred Scale, which Identifies as the Remains of the Fists of Fire.<br>
									<br>
									Go back to the True Form in Trakanon's teeth and hand in the Charred Scale. The scale is returned to you, and you get the following:<br>
									<br>
									Kaiaren says 'Ahhh, impressive indeed! Now that you have broken the chain of the Fists, the others may come toppling down if you persevere. The Fist of Air is now the weakest, then Earth, and finally Water before the master of them all, Vorash. You must defeat them in order, proving the demise of the last to draw out the one you are after. The task before you now is to take this scale and show it to the Fist of Air wherever he may be. Good luck, Zadkiel .<br>
									<br>
									Note: The Charred Scale does not have to be cycled through Kaiaren's true form before going to see Gwan. If you are completing the quest before you hand over the robe, you will not be able to hand in the scale to the True form anyway.<br>
									<br>
									<u>Gwan</u><br>
								</font><font color="#ffcc66"><br>
								</font><font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">A 'Presence', is found in the Plane of Sky, on Noble Dojorns Island, and is the Place Holder for the Fist of Air. The presence has a respawn time of approximately 2 hours. He has the model of a shadowed man, but carries no items, so is invisible apart from his name.<br>
									<br>
									Handing the Presence the scale gets the following response:<br>
									<br>
									A presence says 'Hahaha! That dolt Eejag fell to the likes of you? I'm not surprised. So, I guess this means you're here to challenge me. Normally, I wouldn't waste my time, but since you've defeated my younger brother, I suppose I'm obligated. I'm ready when you are, tell me when you're [prepared].<br>
									<br>
									At this point the presence despawns and immediately respawns in the same location as a Human monk dressed in Shiverback named Gwan. Telling him 'I am prepared' (or attacking him) causes him to attack.<br>
									<br>
									He doesn't respond to hails, and is Level 57. He procs Fist of Air, which a Level 57 resisted every time with a MR of 120 and the Fist of Air proc can knock you backwards, (possibly off the island) and like other mobs of this level, enrages.<br>
									<br>
									Upon death, Gwan's corpse lets out one last, frustrated breath and gasps, 'Trunt! Prepare yourself!'<br>
									<br>
									You cannot trade with the presence (i.e. give him the scale from Eejag,) while it is in the windmill. It is best to give the scale to a presence, causing Gwan to spawn, then pull Gwan into the windmill and kill him. Pulling him is recommended to be done while in Melee range, i.e. WALKING backwards with him. Running off nearly always causes him to path incorrectly, and disappear to another island. It is highly recommended to pull him into the Windmill.<br>
									<br>
									Loot The Breath of Gwan and head to Nurga.<br>
									<br>
									<u>Trunt</u><br>
									<br>
									Within the mines of Nurga, which is located in the Frontier Mountains, there is 'a sleeping Ogre', near a number of spiders not too far into the dungeon. A good marker is a unique graphic to this dungeon, which is a smoking hole in the wall, where you can see lava. When he is spawned he is looking right at that crevice in the wall. The Sleeping Ogres respawn time is approx 3 hours.<br>
									<br>
									The sleeping ogre is indifferent to everyone. Hand in the Breath of Gwan and Trunt will spawn.<br>
									<br>
									Trunt spawns and attacks immediately. He is around 59th level Ogre, hits for around 176, has approx 29k hp, is immune to magic, and his proc, 'Fist of Earth' is a 200dd.<br>
									<br>
									Trunt has no faction, and says no message when he dies. He drops nothing but the Head.<br>
									<br>
									<u>Astral Projections</u><br>
									<br>
									The first Astral Projection is in the Overthere, at location 772, 860, in the bottom of the scorpion chasm. The Scorpions are casters and can cast 340dd's and can fear you as well. The closest entrance to the chasm is at -1400, -1200, but going this way will mean plenty of sneaking (or an invis run) through the Scorpions. Heading to a slope at loc 1810, 668 is the closest to the Projection. He does not need to be fought, is approx 52nd level, but if fought hits for 175 damage, and says nothing on death.<br>
									<br>
									Handing the Projection Trunts head, results in the following:<br>
									<br>
									Astral Projection looks up and down and says, 'Hmmm, I was hoping for something more impressive. This is just a small token of the last person who tried to interfere with my plans. He failed as you shall. But tell me truly, are you the one who has so rudely removed my students?'<br>
									<br>
									'Yes'<br>
									<br>
									Astral Projection says 'I assume you have read about us and spoken with the old man, Kaiaren. Since that time, I have grown in power and influence to a point unseen by any mortal. Unfortunately, I will have to demonstrate a small amount of my skill when I destroy you. This is bad. I must decide whether you are worthy to see the techniques I wield, even though you will die shortly thereafter. Tell me, who are you?<br>
									<br>
									'I am the one'<br>
									<br>
									Astral Projection chuckles and says, 'That's quite a boast, Ashana. All beings strive for nothingness at the most basic level of sentience. However, almost none ever achieve this. Not even I have discarded my ego yet and you stand here and tell me you have? Perhaps you will be a worthy opponent. I shall be waiting in the great lake near here. Take that token as proof of things to come for you. If you still wish to throw your life away so needlessly, return it to my image there. I await your decision.'<br>
									<br>
									He will give you an Eye of Kaiaren, and then the Astral Projection despawns.<br>
									<br>
									The Eye of Kaiaren is received when Trunts head is turned in (along with some experience), but it is only the final text (telling him that 'I am the one') that despawns the Projection. So it is possible to give in Trunts head, receive the eye and leave the AP without despawning him. How this affects the next person, I am unsure, so it may be wise to say the text, meaning the next person has a 'fresh' projection to turn the head into.<br>
									<br>
									<u>The Final Fight</u><br>
									<br>
									The second of the Astral Projections is in the Lake of Ill Omen, and is on a platform on the lake itself. The Platform is too high to climb onto, but SoW and Levitation can get you up there. He is identical in appearance to the other Projection. He is KOS to all, but does not attack and will accept the eye.<br>
									<br>
									When you give the Eye of Kaiaren to the Astral Projection, he despawns immediately, and Deep and Vorash both spawn, who are KOS, and will both attack the Monk.<br>
									<br>
									Deep procs Fist of Water, and hits for 170ish. Vorash procs Fist of Mastery, which is a DD and a stun, and hits for around the same as Deep.<br>
									<br>
									Both Deep and Vorash have no items.<br>
									<br>
									Once killed, Vorash says 'Foolish mortal! You think you have defeated me? Now, witness the true power of Rallos Zek!<br>
									<br>
									Xenevorash will then spawn on the platform, regardless of where Vorash dies.<br>
									<br>
									Xenovorash Procs Fist of Sentience which is a 500DD and a stun, and hits for 250ish. He drops the Demon Fangs once killed.<br>
									<br>
									Xenevorash always runs on low health, so if fighting on the platform he will run into the water unless snared.<br>
									<br>
									<b><u>The Celestial Fists</u></b><br>
									<br>
									Make sure you have the altered book --the Book of Celestial Fists.<br>
									<br>
									If you have followed the quest in order, you will end up with the Book of Celestial Fists and the Demon fangs, and may find that the 'True' Kairen is no longer about. If you have done it the 'proper' way, you can hand the 'Book of the Celestial Fists' and the 'Demon fangs' to the 'mad' version and still get the Fists.<br>
									<br>
									Most people however, will fight the four fists to get the fang, then hand over the Robe to Lheao. This way, the first time you see the True Kaiaren, you can hand in the 'Celestial Fists' book, then when it is returned (and changed), hand him the 'Book of Celestial Fists' to him along with the 'Demon fangs' to obtain the Fists.<br>
									<br>
									Handing either form of Kaiaren (Mad or True) the Book of the Celestial Fists and the Demon Fangs, results in the Monk Epic, the Gloves called the Celestial Fists being handed over, with the following text.<br>
									<br>
									Kaiaren bows his head and breathes a long sigh as if relived of a great weight. He then looks up at you and says, 'I honestly did not believe you could have defeated Vorash. Even though he sought nothing but war and bloodshed, it is a life nonetheless and we must mourn him. I will sew these fangs into magical fist wraps and they shall be yours. Remember Xenevorash. A purpose can be found for every situation and individual. To achieve perfection is to perceive this truth.'<br>
									<br>
									The experience received for finishing this quest was approximately two and a half blue bubs at level 52.<br>
									<br>
									The effect Celestial Tranquility is a right clickable 40% Song haste, +12 AC and +53 Att. It has a duration of 9 seconds.<br>
