		<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Welcome to the Lair! In order to remain active in Huntress Lair, it is strongly suggested that everyone:<br>
			</font></p>
		<ol>
			<li><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Read the <a href="http://www.huntresslair.com/regulations.html" target="Home">Guild Regulations</a> on the Huntress Lair web page.<br>
				</font>
			<li><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Register their character on both <a href="http://pub59.ezboard.com/bhuntresslair">Huntress Lair's Message Board</a> and <a href="http://www.guildmagic.com/">Guildmagic</a>. <br>
				</font>
		</ol>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The message board is key to receiving up to date information regarding the Guild. Council mailings regarding upcoming events and important information will be managed using the message board. Guild magic is also key in maintaining up to date information on guild members in order for us to plan raids and market ourselves as a strong guild. Please also note the following roles:<br>
				<br>
			</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b><u>LCM's</u></b>: Aulilea, Ragord, Sarani Warrel<br>
			</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b><u>Officers</u></b>: Clethos, Ennia, Lothgor, Goldar<br>
				<br>
			</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">In order to access the Message Board, click the &quot;Huntress Lair Message Board&quot; link above. You will see the Message Board appear in a separate window. Scroll all the way down to the bottom of the page  and you will see the &quot;Register an account&quot; link. Be sure to create a global account, which will give you access to hop around to the many message boards that can be useful to playing EQ. This is completely free and only takes a minute. One you have completed the registration process  post your need for access to the private forums under &quot;General Chit Chat&quot; and an administrator will provide it to you.  You will be ready to communicate with the guild by reading and sharing posts. The board can be reached from the home page at any time.<br>
				<br>
			</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">In order to register your character with Guild Magic, click the &quot;Guildmagic&quot; link above and proceed by clicking &quot;click here to create user&quot;.<br>
			</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Once you have created your user, you will be able to log into that user and add valuable information your user 'profile'. An important thing to do immediately is to add the Huntress Lair guild to your Guild Membership. This will notify one of the four administrators of the guild account, who will accept your submission. Once your submission has been accepted your information will appear under Huntress Lair Guild Members. <br>
			</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Your user information can be updated at any time. It is a very easy way to manage your information and level, simply by clicking the DING button.<br>
				<br>
			</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Thank you for your time in reading this email and helping keep Huntress Lair up to date!<br>
