				</font></p>
			<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The first thing you should do is find Stofo Olan. He is on the second floor of the Vasty Deep Inn near the Erudin City Library (Loc: -1100, -60).<br>
					<br>
					Hail him and the conversation is as follows:<br>
				</font></p>
			<blockquote>
				<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><i>'Good day, I have discovered something truly wonderful! If I only had the materials required so I can copy my notes and send them to my teacher'.</i><br>
						<br>
						Ask him 'What materials'<br>
						<br>
						<i>'The materials I need are a mechanical pen, ink of the dark, and white paper. Bring me those and I will give you a copy of this information'.</i><br>
						<br>
						Ask him 'Who is your teacher'<br>
						<br>
						<i>'My teacher is Jeb Lumsed. He was last seen in the regions of the newly discovered lands. If you wish to find him that is where you must seek him out'</i><br>
					</font></p>
			</blockquote>
			<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">You then need to gather the three items and bring them back to Stofo Olan: a Mechanical Pen, Ink of the Dark, and the White Paper.<br>
					<br>
					The Mechanical Pen can be obtained in Ak'Anon. Rilgor Plegnog (in the Mines of Malfunction) in is the one to ask about the Mechanical Pen.<br>
				</font></p>
			<blockquote>
				<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Ask him 'What Mechanical Pen'<br>
						<br>
						<i>'Why do you want one of those contraptions. You will spend more time repairing it then you will writing with it. But if you insist on getting one, you are going to have to do a small favor.'</i><br>
						<br>
					</font></p>
				<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Rilgor Plegnog tugs at your robe and grins evilly.<br>
						<br>
					</font></p>
				<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">'<i>Mighty nice outfit you have there. Sure beats these drab robes us three are wearing. Hmm...my favorite color is purple, in fact a shiny metallic purple would do nicely. How bad did you want that pen?'.</i><br>
					</font></p>
			</blockquote>
			<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">You guessed it, he wants a Shining Metallic Robe (SMR). These are obtained off the Arch Ghoul Magi in the Dead Side of Lower Guk. Rare Spawn and Rare Drop. Once you hand him the SMR he will give you the Mechanical Pen.<br>
					<br>
					To obtain the Ink of the Dark, head on over to Qeynos. Reania Jukle is in the Temple under Qeynos (Loc: 2030, -580).<br>
				</font></p>
			<blockquote>
				<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Ask Reania 'Where Can I find the Ink of the Dark?'<br>
						<br>
						<i>'The ink is the blood of a dark scribe. Tempt him and give him this vial. He should cooperate'.</i><br>
					</font></p>
			</blockquote>
			<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">She will then give you an Empty Ink Vial.<br>
					<br>
					From there head to Lower Guk. The Ghoul Scribe spawns in the Ghoul Sage room (near the Executioner room). Whilst a rare spawn, this shouldn't be too long a camp. Charm the Scribe and hand him the Empty Ink Vial. You will get the Ink of the Dark returned to you.<br>
					<br>
					Then you need to get the White Paper. This part is completed in West Karana. You will need to bring a paper and a quill and these can be obtained from almost all Enchanter guilds. You need to speak with Chrislin Baker (Loc: 1050, -1990).<br>
				</font></p>
			<blockquote>
				<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Hail her and then give her the paper and quill.<br>
						<br>
						<i>Chrislin Baker gives you a hug. 'Thank you so much. I did some cleaning after you left and found this behind a barrel. It may have been left behind by the person who took my materials. You can have it'.</i><br>
					</font></p>
			</blockquote>
			<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">You will then get a Bandit Sash.<br>
					<br>
					A Human Monk named Thrackin Griffen will then spawn at Loc 880, -11570. Kill him and you and loot the White Paper. This mob is almost totally magic immune and a tough battle. Take a group with some tanks and a cleric.<br>
					<br>
					Head back to Erudin City and return to Stofo (Loc: -1100, -60). Give him the three items and he will say the following:<br>
				</font></p>
			<blockquote>
				<p><i><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">'Yes, that is what I wanted.'<br>
						</font></i></p>
				<p><i><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">'Here, take these notes.'<br>
						</font></i></p>
				<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><i>'My teacher will be very interested if he knows what I have found'.</i><br>
					</font></p>
			</blockquote>
			<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">He will then give you a Copy of Notes.<br>
					<br>
					Now it is time to head over to the Burning Woods and speak with Jeb Lumsed (Loc: -1200, -4000).<br>
					<br>
					Give him the Copy of Notes and he will then talk to you:<br>
				</font></p>
			<blockquote>
				<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><i>'I see that you have what I was waiting for. Stofo does do excellent work. It seems that you are to start on a long journey. Take this seal and it will guide you on your next step. Seek out the masters of enchantment. In time we will craft the Serpent for you. When you have collected the four parts of the staff, you must combine them in a bundle for me. If you need a sack, just let me know'.</i><br>
						<br>
						He will also give you the coin Jeb's Seal.<br>
						<br>
						Tell him 'I need a sack'<br>
						<br>
						<i>'Take this sack and combine the items I requested in it. Then return it to me'.</i><br>
						<br>
						He will then give you an Enchanter's Bag.<br>
						<br>
						Ask him 'Who are the four other masters'<br>
						<br>
						<i>'The masters are enchanters who have reached the plateau of understanding. Their names are Modani Qu'Loni, Mizzle Gepple, Nadia Starfeast, and Polzin Mrid. All are master crafters in their own right'.</i><br>
						<br>
						Ask him 'Who is Modani'<br>
						<br>
						<i>'Modani is a master of illusions. You should seek him out first. Keep a careful eye out for him - he is never in his true form. The last time I spoke to him, he seemed very excited about his voyage to the elven outpost. You may or may not find more clues about his location there.'</i><br>
						<br>
						Ask him 'Who is Mizzle'<br>
						<br>
						<i>'Mizzle is a gnome who has mastered the use of enlightened magic. Go to him once you have spoken to Modani. Mizzle is not one to travel, so you should not have to look far from his home to find him'.</i><br>
						<br>
						Ask him 'Who is Nadia'<br>
						<br>
						<i>'The mistress of charm, Nadia is very beautiful. She, too, traveled with her relatives to the new land. I just recently received a letter from her. She says more and more pilgrims and explorers are arriving every day, and that the outpost is well defended now'.</i><br>
						<br>
						Ask him 'Who is Polzin'<br>
						<br>
						<i>'Master of the Phantasms - he is the last one you will seek out. Hmm...Polzin is native to Erudin, however, after the incident near Paineel, no one has heard from him. I hope that he is well'.</i><br>
					</font></p>
			</blockquote>
			<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Now the fun begins. You have to find the four masters and complete sub-quests for all of them.<br>
					<br>
					<b><u>Enchanter Master One</u></b><br>
					<br>
					First go and locate Modani Qu'Loni in Overthere (Loc: +540 -940). Modani is in the form of a Scorpion. Actually getting to Modani can be tricky sometimes as there are other Scorpions nearby that can make it a challenge. Either kill them, or have someone lure them away so you can speak to Modani.<br>
				</font></p>
			<blockquote>
				<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">'Hail Modani Qu`Loni'<br>
					</font></p>
				<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><i>'The hidden self inside a myriad of magic is one that walks quite softly. Yes, that is what you must seek.'</i><br>
						<br>
						Give Modani Jeb's Seal.<br>
						<br>
						<i>'Ah yes, Jeb's seal. The time to craft a Serpent must have come. I will need components collected to craft the first of the pieces. I will also provide you with a sack in which you must combine the items. Are you ready to collect them?'</i><br>
						<br>
						'I am ready to collect them.'<br>
						<br>
						<i>'Scattered throughout the world are various items. To prove your worth, go collect these and return them to me. The Xolion Rod, Innoruuk's Word, Chalice of Kings, and snow blossoms.'</i><br>
						<br>
						'I need a sack.'<br>
						<br>
						<i>'Take this sack and combine the items I requested in it. Then return it to me. '</i><br>
						<br>
						You will receive an Enchanter's Bag<br>
						<br>
						'What is the Chalice of Kings?'<br>
						<br>
						<i>'The Chalice of Kings is the chalice of elven kings. Recently thought to be lost to the ages, it was recently discovered. I need its magical powers to create a magical liquid.'</i><br>
						<br>
						'What is the Xolion Rod?'<br>
						<br>
						\<i>'This is the rod of an ancient civilization found on this continent. Nothing is known of it other than that the scaled ones discovered it years ago.'</i><br>
						<br>
						'What are Snow Blossoms?'<br>
						<br>
						<i>'These are flowers that are also used in the creation process. They were once widespread, but now I am told they only grow in select places.'</i><br>
					</font></p>
			</blockquote>
			<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Head to Oggok and look for Bozlum Blossom (Loc 540, 1150). Hail her and she will start talking:<br>
				</font></p>
			<blockquote>
				<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Bozlum Blossom heaves a great sigh.<br>
						<br>
						Ask her 'What is wrong Bozlum?'<br>
					</font></p>
				<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><i>'Boz like to grow perty flowers in her garden. But garden no more.'</i><br>
						<br>
						'What happened to your flower garden?'<br>
						<br>
						<i>'Boz not know what happen. Only see der biggins footprints in it. Me perty sure my puppy not smash garden. He has tiny feets. Right, puppy?'</i><br>
					</font></p>
				<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Bozlum Blossom pet wags his tail.<br>
					</font></p>
			</blockquote>
			<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Go and find Brokk Boxtripper in a hut outside her caves (Loc: 230, 380).<br>
					<br>
					Once you find him, look for a pair of sandals right next to him. Get it and you will see they are called Large Muddy Sandals. Take the sandals back to Bozlum and give it to her. She will give you a Scribbled Parchment and ask that you take it to Brokk.<br>
					<br>
					Go to Brokk and give him the Parchment. He will give you a Gift to Bozlum to make up for messing her garden. Give her the Gift.<br>
				</font></p>
			<blockquote>
				<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><i>'Oh, dat silly Brokk. He sent me too many of these perty flowers. Me not know where put them all. Here, you take some cause you help Bozlum. Me like you. Flowers make you smell perty, too'.</i><br>
					</font></p>
			</blockquote>
			<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">She will then give you the Snow Blossoms.<br>
					<br>
					Then get a good group together and head over to Neriak. Inside the Cleric Guild in the Third Gate region you will find Verina Tomb. Verina is on a two day spawn, and often is not up (some other Enchanter has killed her normally). You may have to just wait, or pop back now and then to check on her. She is a level 60 Dark Elf Cleric and you can kill her without aggroing the guards (provided you aren't Kill on Sight to the guards).<br>
					<br>
					You will loot Innoruuk's Word off her once she is dead.<br>
					<br>
					The Xolion Rod can be obtained by killing Vessel Drozlin in the Cabilis Shaman guild (Loc: 591, -826.) You will need to swim through the large pool and go through the tunnels. Becareful as this monster is also immune to most magic, and will run through a one way door as the fight progresses. He also has some guards. Take a good high level group (or more if worried).<br>
					<br>
				</font></p>
			<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Kill Drozlin and then loot the Xolion Rod.<br>
					<br>
					Now its time to head over to Chardok and head deep inside the dungeon. You have to kill Prince Selrach Di'zok (Loc: -560 +1360). The Prince is a level 61 Warrior and to fight him and clear the path to his room you will need some heavy fighting power. Kill the Prince and loot his head. Then go to Felwithe and look for Joren Nobleheart in the Magician guild.<br>
					<br>
					Hail him and then give him the princes head.<br>
				</font></p>
			<blockquote>
				<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><i>'Vengeance has been fufilled! However, the King still has a heavy heart. Not until Firiona has been return can this sadness be lifted. But in appreciation of your efforts, I am honored to present to you the King's Chalice'.</i><br>
					</font></p>
			</blockquote>
			<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">He will then give you the Chalice of Kings.<br>
					<br>
					Once you have the Xolion Rod, Innoruuk's Word, the Chalice of Kings, and Snow Blossoms, put all of them in the Enchanter's Bag Modani previously gave you and hit the combine button.<br>
					<br>
					You will create a new item called a Sack for Modani.<br>
					<br>
					Go back to the Overthere and see Modani once again (Loc: +540 -940). Give him the Sack for Modani.<br>
					<br>
					'Excellent, you have done well. Here is the first piece of the staff. Now you must go seek out the second master; he will clear the path for you'.<br>
					<br>
					You will get the 1st Piece of Staff.<br>
					<br>
					<b><u>Enchanter Master Two</u></b><br>
					<br>
				</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Next you need to find Mizzle Gepple in Ak'Anon (Loc: 2020, -520). Mizzle is hiding as a Clockwork Gnome. You will see him as Clockwork VIIX. Check by asking him if he is Mizzle and he should say he is.<br>
					<br>
				</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Ask for a sack. Mizzle will then give you another Enchanter's Bag and ask you to collect four different items, a Spoon, the One Key, the Lost Scroll, and the book Charm and Sacrifice. This is a much easier quest than Modani's.<br>
					<br>
				</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The Spoon is on a named sand giant called Cazel, you can find him in the Oasis of Maar. Whilst he is only level 50 he has ridiculous regen and hits very hard. 2 groups are recommended to kill Cazel, or one very high level group. Kill him and grab the Spoon.<br>
					<br>
				</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Head on over to to the Overthere on the boat which leaves from the Oasis dock. On the top of a little ledge at Loc: -190, -380 you should find the key. The key spawns once every 24 hours.<br>
					<br>
				</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The Lost Scroll is at the bottom of Dalnir's Crypt. Go to Loc -20, 50. You will see a bed next to a wall. The scroll will spawn between the bed and the wall every 24 hours.<br>
					<br>
				</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The Book of Charm and Sacrifice is in the Plane of Sky on a table in the quest room at Loc: 1300, 560. The book spawns once every 24 hours.<br>
					<br>
				</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Put the Spoon, the One Key, the Lost Scroll, and the Book of Charm and Sacrifice in the Enchanter's Bag Mizzle previously gave you and combine them. You will get a Sack for Mizzle.<br>
					<br>
				</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Give this back to Mizzle Gepple in Ak'Anon (Loc: 2020, -520).<br>
				</font></p>
			<blockquote>
				<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">'Oh excellent, you have done what is required. Here take this part, and seek the third master, you are well on your way'.<br>
					</font></p>
			</blockquote>
			<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">He will then give you the 2nd Piece of Staff.<br>
					<br>
				</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b><u>Enchanter Master Three</u></b><br>
					<br>
				</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Nadia Starfeast has your next sub-quest. Head over to Firiona Vie to Loc: -3870, 2525 (be careful of your faction here, you may need to raise it if you are kill on sight by killing goblins in Warslik Woods).<br>
					<br>
				</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Hail her and ask for a sack. She will give you another Enchanter's Bag and ask that you obtain the essence of four different stones: a Dull Diamond, a Dull Sapphire, a Dull Ruby, and a Dull Emerald.<br>
					<br>
				</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">To obtain these you will need to transform them into enchanted versions of the gems. To do so, you will need to charm a few different creatures.<br>
				</font></p>
			<blockquote>
				<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">'What gems?'<br>
					</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><i>'I have prepared some gems that you will need to trap the essence. You will need to force a diamond, sapphire, ruby and emerald onto special creatures to obtain their essence.</i><br>
						<br>
					</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">What diamond?'<br>
					</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><i>'Here is the diamond that I have prepared for you. Its only purpose is to trap the essence of a particular book worm. If you should fail in your first attempt. Do not worry, I will provide you with another.</i><br>
						<br>
					</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">'What sapphire?'<br>
					</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><i>'Here is the sapphire that I have prepared for you. Take it and give it to the one referred to as the Golden Faerie.</i><br>
						<br>
					</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">'What ruby?'<br>
					</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><i>'Blood red is the ruby that I have given you. The city that you must travel to has no sun, but still a day and night. And at night, the mist could suffocate one. Tis the fate of poor Jaxion.</i><br>
						<br>
					</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">'What emerald?'<br>
					</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><i>Nadia Starfeast jumps. 'Eeekk... a scorpian. I thought they rid this area of these critters. Those things give me the creepers. Take this emerald and be on your way.</i>'<br>
					</font></p>
			</blockquote>
			<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">To obtain the Enchanted Diamond go to Kaesora. You need to get to Loc: 85, -415. It is quite easy to get there. Once you enter Kaesora, cast levitate and invis, and go straight forwards and drop down the hole. Don't go all the way down - just keep heading straight ahead onto the ledge in front of you. Enter the room with the three spiders and turn right and go through that door. Directly behind that door there is a secret wall which you go through then just before you hit the corner, cast invis vs. undead. Enter the building you see when you go round the corner.<br>
					<br>
				</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Here you will find either a Spectral Librarian or a Tortured Librarian (placeholder). Kill the Tortured Librarian until the Spectral Librarian spawns. Then charm him and give him the Dull Diamond. He will then give you the Enchanted Diamond and turn into a Enraged Spectral Librarian. If you kill this spawn it will turn into three Freed Souls which cast some nasty area Area Effect spells. They have almost no hitpoints though but take them out quick. They are an optional extra you can gate out once you have the Enchanted Diamond if you like.<br>
					<br>
				</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Then head to the City of Mist and look for the Wraith of Jaxion. It spawns right up the back in Neh'Ashiir's building near the Reaver. It is a rare spawn. If it is not there, keep killing everything near there until it does. Then charm it and hand the Dull Ruby. You will get the Enchanted Ruby.<br>
					<br>
				</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Head to the Overthere. Look for a scorpion called Impaler Tzilug at Loc: -90, 810. Charm the Impaler (like Modani this might mean killing some other NPC's first) and give him the Dull Emerald. In return, he will give you the Enchanted Emerald.<br>
					<br>
				</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Now head to Skyfire and look for the a tiny Chromodac called Felia Goldenwing near the Burning Woods zone. Felia is another rare spawn and you might have to kill a bunch of other placehoder spawns to trigger her. Once she does spawn, quickly charm her and avoid taking her anywhere near other Skyfire spawns. Other mobs will kill her on sight. After you charm Felia, hand her the Dull Sapphire and she will give you an Enchanted Sapphire.<br>
					<br>
				</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Combine the Enchanted Diamond, Enchanted Sapphire, Enchanted Ruby, and Enchanted Emerald in the Enchanter's Bag Nadia gave you. You will create a new item called a Sack for Nadia.<br>
					<br>
				</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Give Nadia back her new sack.<br>
				</font></p>
			<blockquote>
				<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><i>'Excellent, you have done what is required. Here take this part, and seek the fourth master, to complete your quest'.</i><br>

			<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">She will then give you the 3rd Piece of Staff.<br>

				</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Next head to The Hole and find Polzin Mrid (Loc: 210, -50).<br>
