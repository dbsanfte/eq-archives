			<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><u>Hail Lair Members!</u></b><br>
					<br>
					Huntress Lair, if not already, will have a vast amount of people seeking help &amp; information concerning their EPICS.  We all realize that EPIC questing is one of the hardest types of questing ever created in the lands of Norrath-- thousands of players working piece by piece to acquire that one item that makes their class unique.  The following will explain both verbally and visually what this Epic Center is all about.  <br>
					<br>
					<u><b>Why an Epic Center?</b></u><br>
					<br>
					As we grow in Norrath, we obtain items.  Some items will never be obtained by anyone else, and others are as common as spider&#x2019;s silk.  What&#x2019;s unique about EPICS is that each weapon has a class specific ability.  Through study, perseverance, and time, one can potentially obtain one of the most sought after items within the game of Everquest.<br>
					<br>
					This Epic Center was developed for the following reasons:<br>
				</font></p>
			<ol>
				<li><font size="2" face="Arial">Information about the steps needed to obtain your EPIC weapon.</font>
				<li><font size="2" face="Arial">Posting of needed items left until your EPIC questing is complete.</font>
				<li><font size="2" face="Arial">Guild participation &amp; communication with EPIC raids and quests.<br>
					</font>
			</ol>
			<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><u>Can I post what I need for my EPIC?</u></b><br>
					<br>
					We realize that Huntress Lair membership is growing phenomenally.  Some may have more than one character; others may have more than one account.  Too make this fair, and easier for everyone (especially those keeping track of Epic Center information); let&#x2019;s limit the Epic Center membership to <u>ONE character per HL member</u>.  Once that one character has their EPIC quest finished, then another of your characters may be posted in their place based 'EPIC&nbsp;ready' guildlines below.  This will ensure equality, an even distribution of the quest items when obtained, and fairness to every Huntress Lair member.<br>
					<br>
					<b><u>Where do I post/submit my EPIC information?</u></b><br>
					<br>
					Until the formal application submission on the Huntress Lair home page is complete, please post your information to the <a href="http://pub59.ezboard.com/fhuntresslairfrm20">Epic Center Forum</a> on the Huntress Lair Message Board.  Your desire to obtain an EPIC item and/or your need for an EPIC item will not be assumed. Your character should be identified in the subject area of your post and the following information should follow:<br>
				</font></p>
			<ol>
				<li><font size="2" face="Arial">List each item in which assistance from the guild is required to obtain.  We are not interested in those items you are able to obtain on your own.</font>
				<li><font size="2" face="Arial">List the corresponding zone where each item can be obtained.</font>
				<li><font size="2" face="Arial">List the corresponding level range needed to obtain each item if known.<br>
					</font>
			</ol>
			<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><u><b>What happens after I post/submit my EPIC information?</b></u><br>
					<br>
					Once you have submitted your EPIC information, your information will be organized for public display on the Epic Member Status spreadsheet located below.  Based on this information, Huntress Lair can begin to assess and schedule events that will result in acquiring these items.<br>
					<br>
					<u><b>Who has priority in receiving a needed item for an EPIC quest?</b></u><br>
					<br>
					At this time, only those level <b>45</b> and above are eligible to begin questing for their EPIC.  Members farthest into their EPIC quest will receive priority in receiving a needed item.  Rather then randomly select a recipient of an item it was deemed fairest that a member that has spent four months working on their EPIC quest receive priority in receiving an items over a member that has spent two months.  <br>
				</font></p>
			<ul>
				<li type="disc"><font size="2" face="Arial">The only exception is if an event was organized and led by a member specifically to obtain an EPIC item.</font>
				<li type="disc"><font size="2" face="Arial">Should there be more then member at the same place in their Epic then those members will randomly roll for the item and fate shall decide.  </font>
				<li type="disc"><font size="2" face="Arial">If no one of a particular class has started their EPIC at all, the person who posts their need for assistance and desire to begin their EPIC first takes precedence.</font>
				<li type="disc"><font size="2" face="Arial">You MUST be present for 75% of the actual event in order to qualify for an item.</font>
				<li type="disc"><font size="2" face="Arial">One a member obtains his EPIC he will not be allowed to start a second EPIC quest, until all other &#x2018;EPIC ready&#x2019; individuals have obtained theirs.</font>
				<li type="disc"><font size="2" face="Arial">Epic Ready is defined as those members who have the desire to obtain their EPIC and those classes the guild is capable of handling.<br>
					</font>
			</ul>
			<p><font size="2" face="Arial">In addition, you should also note <a href="http://www.huntresslair.com/Epics/EpicAbility.html">Huntress Lair&#x2019;s EPIC abilities</a> at this time, as this will play an important role in priority as well as attention.   This information will be updated on a regular basis as the guild continues to grow, in hope that Huntress Lair will have the ability to handle all EPIC quests in the future.  <br>
					<br>
					<b><u>Please note:</u></b> these are preliminary rules that were agonized over and can change at any time.  Should you have any questions, comments or concerns please feel free to bring them to our attention under the Epic Center Forum for review and consideration.<br>
