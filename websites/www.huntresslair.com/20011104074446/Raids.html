				<br>
			</p>
		</div>
		<ol>
			<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2">Prepare to listen the the raid leader(s) very closely throughout the entire time you are on the raid - if you want to visit and chat with friends, this isn't the time to do it.<br>
					<br>
				</font>
			<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2">Prepare to follow directions the raid leader(s) give the groups to the letter -- errant group members will only end up costing a lot of deaths and down time during the raid. <br>
					<br>
				</font>
			<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2">Be prepared to hear from a raid leader, directly, if you aren't following directions specifically and never take it as a personal attack. Learn from what they tell you and let the rest roll off your back...if you can't, be prepared to be TL'd out.<br>
					<br>
				</font>
			<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2">Be prepared and willing to die. If you aren't and you think it's going to be too hairy, ask for a TL out of the zone from a wizard in attendance.<br>
					<br>
				</font>
			<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2">Be as easy to work with during CR and res'ing as possible. Raids are very stressful if things go haywire and require much patience and willingness to get back on track from all raid members.<br>
					<br>
				</font>
			<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2">Remember you will not always get experience or items. Most raids are put together for epics and or uber items for guild members -- not for loot for everyone or even experience. Some groups are simply auxilary groups.<br>
					<br>
				</font>
			<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2">Make yourself invaluable. Play your class to the very very best of your ability and be considerate of people around you.<br>
				</font>
