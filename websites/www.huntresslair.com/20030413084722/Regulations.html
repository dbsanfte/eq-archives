		<p><font color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><b>Inviting New Members:</b><br>
				<br>
				There are a few minimal rules that we ask you to follow when interested in inviting an Everquest player join our guild. There will be many players over time that will show interest in joining our guild, and it is up to us to choose those players that we feel will make great members. The following is a few pointers and suggestions to filter out and find these great members.<br>
				<br>
			</font></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p><font color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><b>Friends:</b><br>
					<br>
					Some of the best members are those people you are good friends with, be it in the game, or in real-life. Encourage the guild to socialize with your good friends, or those that you think would be good members. Chances are the hospitality will pay off enough that they will want to eventually join the guild.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Grouping:</b><br>
					<br>
					This is one of the best ways to find a great future guild member. It is easier to discover ones dedication, commitment, persona, and way of game-play while grouped. This is mainly due to the fact that many Everquest players get somewhat involved in trying to 'mold' themselves with a group they've recently joined, that it is relatively easier for the others in the group to decipher their attitude and persona more easily.</font><font color="#ffcc66"><br>
					<br>
				</font><font color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><b>Attitude:</b><br>
					<br>
					This is another thing that can be helpful in deciding if someone would make a great member. You might get along with them, find them funny, or admire their actions for some particular reason or another. Either way, study what they do and how their attitude is, maybe you will find yourself asking him or her if they are interested in knowing more about our guild.</font><font color="#ffcc66"><br>
					<br>
				</font><font color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><b>Guild Tag:</b><br>
					<br>
					It is important that you make sure the person you think would make a great guild member is not already part of another guild. Many people use the '/anon' command, so making the mistake of asking someone in another guild to join our guild is not something that their guild members will easily forget. Finding that you've offended another guild is not fun, so make sure you are positive that a person is guildless before inquiring about his or her thoughts towards guild membership.</font><font color="#ffcc66"><br>

				</font><font color="#ffcc66"><br>
				</font><font color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2">In order to remain active in Huntress Lair, it is strongly suggested that everyone register their character on both Guildmagic and the Message Board. This is key to receiving up to date information regarding the Guild. Council mailings regarding upcoming events and important information will be managed using the message board.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Respect and Maturity</b>:<br>
				</font><font color="#ffcc66"><br>
				</font><font color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2">Be a good representative of Huntress Lair to fellow members as well as people outside of our guild. It is very important that we all treat each other with respect and do our best to keep everyone happy at all times. Most importantly.....You must have fun . This is a game, not work or school. All members must have wonderful, playful, yet mature personalities and enjoy roleplaying. A sense of humor is preferred.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Anonymous vs. Roleplay:</b><br>
				</font><font color="#ffcc66"><br>
				</font><font color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2">Please no /anon. If you are not proud to be in Huntress Lair then please do not join or please remove your tag. Roleplay works as it still shows guild tag, but allows you to go anonymous, where as going /anonymous covers your guild tag.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Member&nbsp;Assistance:</b><br>
				</font><font color="#ffcc66"><br>
				</font><font color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2">It is all of our jobs to create the environment that makes us want to help people in the guild. Help out when you can, however, you will never be forced to. We also do not want anyone to feel bad if they cannot give a guildmember what they need or want. We've been there before and in the end it all works out somehow. Don't take advantage of people. If you have things to give away, consider the guild first.<br>

				</font><font color="#ffcc66"><br>
				</font><font color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2">If another Guild or Guild member (regardless of level) is camping an area, please move on to another area without a fight. Norrath is a vast land with plenty around for all. Sometimes! *Snicker*<br>

				</font><font color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2">This never solves anything and will be put out immediately. You can resolve conflict by talking to that person in /tell or talking to an officer. If that doesn't solve anything, feel free to come to the guild leader. If there are any outbursts in guild chat, you WILL receive a tell from a LCM or Officer.<br>
					<br>
				</font><font color="#ffcc66"><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2">No Begging:<br>
						</font></b><br>
				</font><font color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2">Please do not demand or ask that guild members powerlevel, port, res, give you equipment, camp spawns, give you money, or use their mana/tradeskills. While we are all here to support each other and we do our best to assist with the needs of our members. Help create the environment that makes people want to do this for you and don't expect it. Make friends. Do NOT ask repeatedly in guild chat for the service. In other words NO BEGGING in or out of the guild.<br>
