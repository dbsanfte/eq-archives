		<p>In order to remain active in Huntress Lair, it is strongly suggested that everyone register their character on both Guildmagic and the Message Board. Some of you may have already registered on Guild Magic and not the message board or vice versa. The message board is key to receiving up to date information regarding the Guild. Council mailings regarding upcoming events and important information will be managed using the message board. Guild magic is also key in maintaining up to date information on guild members in order for us to plan raids and market ourselves as a strong guild.<br>
			<br>
			It has been noticed that many of you were having trouble logging into the message board, so we have provided details on how you can. Please click here to reach the Huntress Lair home page:<br>
			<br>

			<br>
			In order to access the Message Board, click Message Board from the navigator menu. You will see the Message Board appear in a separate window (with annoying ads that will be going away any day now). Scroll all the way down to the bottom of the page (past all the ads) and you will see the &quot;Register an account&quot; link. We have also include this link below.<br>

Once you have completed the registration process you are then ready to communicate with the guild by reading and sharing posts.
