				<dt><font size="4" color="#2c471c" face="Book Antiqua">Huntress Lair will not mirror the goals of a typical guild. Instead, we step away from the politics and red-tape often associated with most popular guilds. The guild tag will be more than just a bunch of words next to your character name.<br>
					</font>
				<dt><font size="4" color="#2c471c" face="Book Antiqua"><br>
						
							This is a place to call home, where people can be their closest friends, to have fun and assist in adventuring, fighting, questing, searching, auctioning, etc. The guild will foster a type of structured, sincere, organized, honorable, easy-going, effective, respectful, and fun environment.<br>
					</font>
				<dt><font size="4" color="#2c471c" face="Book Antiqua"><br>
						
							We believe that a guild that plays together...stays together! More important than that is loyalty and honor. Loyalty will get us all their together!<br>
