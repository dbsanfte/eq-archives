		<p>EQ&nbsp;Atlas is collection of Maps and Guides for all areas of Everquest. A must have! For those of you who haven't gone to EQ&nbsp;Atlas to print out every map that exists...I definitely recommend that you do so. Get yourself three ring binder and start printing. I cannot tell you how often it saved my life. Thanks Syntar!</p>
