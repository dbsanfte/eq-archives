					<dt>We need at least two full groups.  I was there during the raid with Realm of Honor and it went well.  The second run through the City consisted of two groups and can give us plenty of options for exp and loot.  It will even allow us to attempt to retrieve the Blank Reaver for the Druid Epic. (I believe)  Should we wish to pursue farther into the City we would need as many groups as we had the first time through, which was about 4-5 groups.  Those that died during that raid was purely an accident.<br>
