								<p><font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">When we finally spawn <a href="http://www.huntresslair.com/images/gallery/enragedGolem.jpg">an enraged golem</a>, Xerius couldn't believe it was finally going to happen. With this being his 53rd time trying to obtain this final piece for the Wizard Epic, the Lair was finally going to do it for him! As Xerius <a href="http://www.huntresslair.com/images/gallery/GolemXerius.jpg">patiently awaits</a> the death of the golem, the golem sure did have a lot of hit points, draining the mana of almost three clerics, but he finally went down and Xerius was the <a href="http://www.huntresslair.com/images/gallery/Golemloot.jpg">proud looter</a>.</font></p>
								<p><font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">This was Huntress Lair's most successful Fear runs through organization as well as effort. Zone-in was a great success, with only one death who stood like a man and died. One wipe-out from a hasty move forward was followed by the most phenomenol corpse run ever seen. We were back at it within 15 minutes. In addition, thank you to a member of our alligned guild, The Elite Force, for joining us.</font></p>

She was a bit in the way, so after MUCH decussion, we decided to take her down. Or try to! and man we had a plan for everything that COULD happen. Well she went down and she fell hard.

								<p><font size="2" color="#ffcc66">We did more than well! Having only two groups, everyone proved that Huntress Lair works well together as a group, as a raid and a guild. We were hit with situations that demanded we do our jobs and lived. We had two deaths up until the last problem encounter, and for a high level zone, that is fantastic!</font></p>
								<p><font size="2" color="#ffcc66">Finally, what fun is a raid without at least a partial wipeout? We waited too long medding before going into the tower and allowed the first room creatures to respawn behind us. So we do it again and make it even farther!</font></p>

									<p><font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times">As I logged onto Laeous and zoned into KC I was asked to help a monk with his quest. Assuming that there would be killing involved being a warrior I gladly accepted.<br>
										</font></p>
									<p><font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times">The monk hired a few others to help him and we all ported over to EJ and headed over to Trak. It wasn't until after we got to the spawning spot that the monk told us that the raptor we would be killing was around 57 or 58. That was a trip considering we only had one group with us, all lower than 55 (Aside from the main tank who was 56)<br>
										</font></p>
									<p><font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times">After we all buffed up and got to FOM the monk turned in the items needed to make the raptor (Which looked more like a T-rex) pop. --You gain party experience-- The monk said &quot;done, he's popped&quot; and in front of us stood a large dinosaur named Zhaoku. Our main tank ran in and got the aggro with the monk and I close on foot.<br>
										</font></p>
									<p><font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times">After a while of fighting Zhaoku became enraged and took a few bites out of me. Zhaoku hits YOU for 137, 112, 219, 69, 162, 129, 153, 63, 104, 63 and fast! Soon, torn up, and beat down, Zhaoku was slain. &quot;You have slain Zhaoku&quot; Needless to say I was very excited. The monk looted his Thule touched bone chips (Or something like that) and we were ported back to the Dread Lands. Laeous was paid and quickly made his way to the bank, wallet stuffed full of platinum.<br>
