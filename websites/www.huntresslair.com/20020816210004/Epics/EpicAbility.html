		</div>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">We are aware that there are many members of Huntress Lair who are of a level to begin their Epic weapon quests. This is a proud moment for any guild, since it demonstrates the guild's ability to work together to do things that no one player (or one group of players) can do alone. Our guild is advancing quickly to the level where we can assist our members in beginning their Epics, but we still have limitations for completing them, which  we have outlined for each Epic in turn.  <br>
			</font></p>
		<div align="center">
			<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>As our strength as a guild grows so will the updates to this information.</b><br>
				</font></p>
		</div>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>The Bard Epic</b> is for the most part a straight forward one. There are several sections, most of which can be accomplished with one or at most two groups. Regrettably, there are four areas which we as a guild cannot manage <i>at this point</i>. There is a trip to Fear, a red dragon kill, a white dragon kill, and the killing of the alternate Trakanon. Unless we can find resources to supplement the guild (in the case of the bardic Trakanon, to an enormous extent), we cannot <i>complete</i> Bard Epic <i>at this time</i>.<br>
				<br>
			</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>The Beastlord Epic</b> cannot be addressed at this time, since we have never seen it done, and have never participated in any part of it. It looks fairly straightforward, other than the three Draz Nurakk kills. Information on this Epic would be most helpful.<br>
				<br>
			</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>The Cleric Epic</b> is well known, and has three bottlenecks, Ixiblat, the Overking, and of course Ragefire. While this Epic can be started, our guild does not have the firepower <i>at present</i> for any of these bottlenecks.<br>
				<br>
			</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>The Druid Epic</b> has again, three bottlenecks. Ullump is a problem, since he requires a solid group of 55 plus to kill, or three to four groups of 50 plus. Faydedar is a dragon, like any other, with the same problems as any other dragon to kill. Venril Sathir remains is certainly not the fight the real Venril Sathir is, but he still takes two groups of 55 plus to be certain of killing (although five level 60 Wizards can kill him in under six seconds).<br>
				<br>
			</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>The Enchanter Epic</b> has a lot of bottlenecks for us. Verina Tomb is certainly not within our current abilities, Vessil Drozlin is possible, but would require luck on our part, Prince Di'Zok is again beyond us <i>at present</i>, the Ghost of Kindle again needs a 55 plus level group, Spirit of a Shissar can be killed by anybody, but requires a trip to Fear, the sheer number of trips to Hate needed for the Essence of the Vampire, and of course the Tangrin, who again needs at least one group of 55 plus. <i>At this point</i>, we do not have immediate hope of assisting our Enchanters with their Epics, as the number of bottlenecks <i>at this time</i> are far too great.<br>
				<br>
			</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>The Mage Epic</b> is not bad for us to a point, but the three bottlenecks are big ones. A trip to Hate is beyond our guild strength <i>at this time</i>, and getting another guild to allow you to come along for the staff could be tricky, Captain Rottgrime takes some heavy hitters to attempt, and the Crown of Elemental Mastery ranks up with the hardest part of any Epic out there, since it requires getting to the seventh island in Sky, a task that even the biggest guilds have trouble with.<br>
				<br>
			</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>The Monk Epic</b> is a short one, and has only five major fights in it. Unfortunately, the last three of these require two to four high level groups to accomplish, and our guild <i>at present</i> is short on that.<br>
				<br>
			</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>The Necromancer Epic</b> is a lot of work, but only three fights that require high end participation. Regrettably, those fights are Cazic Thule, Innoruuk, and a quest in the plane of Sky (the items from Cazic Thule and Innoruuk also drop from other 'boss' spawn in the zone).<br>
				<br>
			</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>Paladin Epic</b> is as unique as the Monk one, meaning that most of it is already done by the time the Paladin reaches Epic levels. Soulfire is routine for us, but does mean that all who help with it become KOS in Freeport (rumor says forever afterwards), so it is sometimes difficult to find people to help with it. Fiery Avenger is something of a problem. Ghoulbane is obviously routine, whether quest or drop. Our guild is close to being dragon level, and we anticipate being capable of handling Vox and Nagafen by the end of the summer, but the books of scale do not drop every time, and there is competition for the dragons. We can do it, but it will not be fast.<br>
			</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">We cannot say the same about the Lich of Miragul, who needs three groups of 50 plus levelled characters to kill. Once that is done though, it requires a simple trip to the Plane of Sky to finish Fiery Avenger. Fiery Defender, the actual Paladin Epic needs a trip to Hate and a lot of luck on a trigger spawn, a trip to the Hole for a routine spawn, if it was not so far in, Kirak Vil, who is a real problem for us, since he needs again three groups of level 50 plus to kill (immune to all spells but Lures, and resists those routinely). We almost have the power for a Paladin Epic, and perhaps with a hand from another guild, we could field one.<br>
				<br>
			</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>Ranger Epic</b> is somewhat harder than the druid one. The initial critical points are similar. Venril Sathir remains is beyond us, although not as much as it was. The Essense Tamer in Sky might be possible, although I would want to bring a few more plane capable people than our guild currently has to try it. We then come to the point where we cannot pass, and we would be hardpressed to find a friendly guild to assist us. Innoruuk himself. He is the last thing to kill to finish the Ranger Epic, and since he was upgraded (not that we could have killed him even before the upgrade) we do not have a chance. On the plus side, since the Ranger Epic is two pieces, we might be able to field half of it, given help with Venril Sathir remains and Essense Tamer.<br>
				<br>
			</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>The Rogue Epic</b> is really a joke when you get down to it. It is the only Epic that can be done in nine hours or less with a little luck on the spawn. There are few critical points and only one bad one. Renux needs two groups at our guild levels, or one group 55 plus to kill (Ragord has helped kill him in a group of three, Druid to taunt and keep aggro, two Wizards to Nuke, the Rogue stood by and looted when the fight was done). Robe of Kedge means Phinny, and we can handle him with a bit of luck (although again  we would need to field two or three groups of 50 plus; one group of 55 plus can manage him and I have seen it done with less). Robe of Ishva is just boring to camp, so let the Rogue find a friend and head into Paw. We can also get our Rogues robes from the dark elves in Kithicor, although the drop rate has been reduced, or let the Rogue buy the Ishva if he wants the Epic. The Shiny Metallic and the Oracle Robes are the Rogue's problem. If he wants guild help, we can help with those. And we of course come to the only hard part of the Rogue Epic; the General. We do not have the full group of level 60 needed to kill him, or the five groups of 55 plus. However, since he can be repeatedly spawned as long as it is night, it is normal for larger guilds to assist smaller ones with this step, since it is the last step of an Epic.<br>
				<br>
			</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>Shadow Knight Epic</b> we wish we could handle, but we cannot. Kurron Ni needs one group of 50 plus to handle, and since it requires a lot of cash spent at this point to trigger him, two is better. Still, he is routine enough. He is unfortunately the easy part. The Ratman Guard needs two groups of 50 plus. Soul Leech is dropped by Cazic Thule himself, or any of his four Lieutenants (the three golems and Dracoliche) and is a rather rare drop. Blade of Abrogation is dropped in the Plane of Sky and is common enough on a full raid, but we do not have the power for a full raid. We would need to be incredibly lucky to get one. Ashenbone drakes for the hide are common enough in Hate, and we have the power for a Hate raid. Drake Spine means Rharzar in Rathe Mts, needing two 50 plus groups. Things get a trifle tougher after that in the Epic. Three spawns must be killed in the Hole, although two of them are not all that far in. It requires killing a 56 Warrior spawn and having to fight a 55 Paladin and 55 Cleric at the same time. And of course, we get the jackpot right at the end of the Epic, that being Lhranc himself, needing six full groups of 50 plus to kill. We would love to say we can overcome these odds. We cannot <i>at this time</i>.<br>
				<br>
			</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>Shaman Epic</b> is not much harder than the Rogue one. The first half of the Epic can be done solo, and the rest of it has exactly three fights, although they are substantial ones. Black Dire needs one group of 46 plus, if you can seperate him from his guards, one group of 50 plus if you cannot. Lord Ghiosk in the City of Mist needs three groups of 50 plus and rumour says he has been increased in level to need three groups of 55 plus, due to the number of Shaman Epics pouring into the world. High Scale Kurn in the Hole is similar, needing three groups of 55 plus. The Iksar child of course is nothing to kill, but since you need to find a group going to the Plane of Fear who is willing to hunt him down for you, it takes time. Lord Rak'Ashiir is bad news from beginning to end, needing those three groups of 55 plus, unless you use a patented three Magician strategy to kill him, then you can do it with three 50 plus groups. Either way, Shaman Epic is beyond our guild <i>at this time</i> unless we borrow high level help from another guild.<br>
				<br>
			</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>Warrior Epic</b> is the second hardest of all the Epics. We do not have a chance to touch it. Virtually no guild can. Things are easy up to a point, then we run into the Queen of Chardok, needing multiple groups of 55 plus to get to, and a lot of luck to kill without at least a handful of level 60. Red scale means Nagafen or the Scalekeeper. We can handle that. Green scale means Severilous, who we not only cannot field the power to kill, but is also the second most contested spawn in Norrath, since the only other way to get the green scale means going a third of the way into Veeshan's Peak. Maestro of Rancor is possible to us, but as one of the one week spawns in Hate, bigger guilds routinely kill him for the other loot he carries. And of course we end up with the last step in the Epic, and the hardest, the Spiroc Wingblade, found on the fifth island in Sky on a mob that requires three groups of 55 plus to even attempt, and two RL days to get to.<br>
				<br>
			</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>Wizard Epic</b> has only three kills, but they are bad ones. Venril Sathir himself in Karnor is a nightmare to any small guild and does not always drop the staff. Phinny in Kedge keep is hard to get to, hard to kill, although within our power, but drops the staff one in three times at best. He is a fast spawn though, reappearing in only 14 hours. The mini bosses in Fear drop the Cazic Skin very rarely, but at least there is a way around that one, even if it does require killing the Broken Golem, a creature with 150,000 hits who doubles for 400, who also lives in Fear. Three high level groups, four if you can get them, tank and Cleric heavy to kill him. I do not know of any guild willing to let people come along just to loot those staves, so this one is probably outside our range at present, although not by too much.<br>
				<br>
			</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">These are the Epics as we see them at this time. As our strength as a guild grows and as more people level beyond 40's so will the updates to this information.</font></p>
