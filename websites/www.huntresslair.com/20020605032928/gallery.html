							<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times">As I logged onto Laeous and zoned into KC I was asked to help a monk with his quest. Assuming that there would be killing involved being a warrior I gladly accepted.<br>
								</font></p>
							<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times">The monk hired a few others to help him and we all ported over to EJ and headed over to Trak. It wasn't until after we got to the spawning spot that the monk told us that the raptor we would be killing was around 57 or 58. That was a trip considering we only had one group with us, all lower than 55 (Aside from the main tank who was 56)<br>
								</font></p>
							<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times">After we all buffed up and got to FOM the monk turned in the items needed to make the raptor (Which looked more like a T-rex) pop. --You gain party experience-- The monk said &quot;done, he's popped&quot; and in front of us stood a large dinosaur named Zhaoku. Our main tank ran in and got the aggro with the monk and I close on foot.<br>
								</font></p>
							<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times">After a while of fighting Zhaoku became enraged and took a few bites out of me. Zhaoku hits YOU for 137, 112, 219, 69, 162, 129, 153, 63, 104, 63 and fast! Soon, torn up, and beat down, Zhaoku was slain. &quot;You have slain Zhaoku&quot; Needless to say I was very excited. The monk looted his Thule touched bone chips (Or something like that) and we were ported back to the Dread Lands. Laeous was paid and quickly made his way to the bank, wallet stuffed full of platinum.<br>
