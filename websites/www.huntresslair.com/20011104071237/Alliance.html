			<dt><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2" color="black">Much like ourselves, Realm of Honor does not mirror the common goals of getting the best loot, the most loot, having certain level requirements and obscure rules to obtain permanent membership. Items and loot are only side-effects of teamwork by good, decent players who enjoy the game. <br>
					<br>
				</font>
			<dt><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2" color="black">Instead, we step away from the politics and red-tape often associated with most popular guilds. The guild tag will be more than just a bunch of words next to your character name. <br>

			<dt><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2" color="black">This is a place where we can be with most of their best Everquest friends to have fun and have help in adventuring, fighting, questing, searching, auctioning, etc. The guild will foster a type of structured, sincere, organized, honorable, easy-going, small, effective, respectful, and fun environment.<br>
					<br>
				</font>
			<dt><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2" color="black">Characters of any level, class, and race will find the freedom to be &quot;uber&quot; in their own way and at their own pace without feeling heavy demands and pressures of having to live their Everquest lives the way others want them to.<br>
				</font>
			<dt><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2" color="black">We believe that to become a good player, you need guidance when you first begin, and that only through teamwork will you become great for the rest of your EQ lives. Most of all, the key words here are LOYALTY and HONOR.<br>

				</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2" color="black">Our Blood of the Soul guild alliance has been formed to provide our high level friends access to high level raids, as they are a 50+ member only guild. This is an honorable alliance in that no members will be allowed to guild swap. Some of Soul's best allies are Blue Cloak. Blue Cloak had raided with Blood of the Soul so much that they are like family. Blanky spends most of his time in Veks or WL .... SG or Kael soemtimes. They are also allied with Midgets so they have been working to get those midget armor drops out of the Kael arena as much as they can. At some point in the near future we will try to find the right time to try out grouping for the first time.<br>

					I will do my best to post annoucements for any events on either Guild Message of the Day or the website so stay tuned.</font><br>

			<dt>I have recently been notified by Elex that Obsidian Guard is interested in working with Huntress Lair.  There is not much more information that I can provide you at this time.  Elex is a top executive of a corporation and has been assigned to a task force working with issues related to their losses at the World Trade Center in New York.  He hopes that he will be freed up soon in order that he may return to his favorite distraction.  My thoughts and prayers are with him.  <br>
