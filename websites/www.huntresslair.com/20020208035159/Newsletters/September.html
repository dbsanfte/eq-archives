					</u></b></font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">As you all may have noticed we have started a new assistant officer status.  We asked Yildian, Philaris and Freekin and they have accepted this title.<br>
				<br>
			</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">At this point, it is an acting officer without the priviledge of inviting people in.  They have the authority to resolve problems the way that they feel an officer would.  This is really something new that Aulilea and I have discussed.  We will be coming up with a more official job description in the coming weeks.  If you all would like to let us know what you feel we should post as the job description, please do so on the message board.<br>

			</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">I have recently contacted the Leader of Obsidian Guard to get an idea as to when we can become active.  As you may remember I was waiting to hear as to whether or not our alliance with Obsidian Guard was a go.  His reponse to me was:<br>

I had sent him an email stating that we were interested in getting a bit more intimate with their guild members and this was his response to me.  Very nice message I might add.<br>
