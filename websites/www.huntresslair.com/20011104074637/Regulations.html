		<p><font color="#2c471c" face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="3">Be a good representative of Huntress Lair to fellow members as well as people outside of our guild. It is very important that we all treat each other with respect and do our best to keep everyone happy at all times. Most importantly.....You must have fun . This is a game, not work or school. &nbsp;All members must have wonderful, playful, yet mature personalities and enjoy roleplaying. A sense of humor is preferred.</font><font color="#2c471c" face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="3"><br>

		<p><font color="#2c471c" face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="3">It is all of our jobs to create the environment that makes us want to help people in the guild. Help out when you can, however, you will never be forced to. We also do not want anyone to feel bad if they cannot give a guildmember what they need or want. We've been there before and in the end it all works out somehow. Don't take advantage of people. If you have things to give away, consider the guild first.<br>

		<p><font color="#2c471c" face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="3">A guild member can sell anything to the guild for a reasonable going rate price. Pricing can be determined by going to www.eqprices.com. Any donations that you wish to make to the guild should be given to our guild banker, HuntressMule. Any items donated to the guild banker will be sold to members highly discounted. While they will not be given away, this is due to the future needs of the guild as it progresses into raids. We will soon have a list of items available for purchase through HuntressMule soon.</font></p>

		<p><font color="#2c471c" face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="3">Consideration will be given to those members who wish to have a second character join the guild, under the provision that their main character has reached Level 45. This provision has been made, in order to encourage main character growth.  This provision does not apply to Officers in the guild for a number of reasons:</font><font color="#2c471c" face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="3"><br>

			<p><font color="#2c471c" face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="3">1. Officers have a huge responsibility in the success of Huntress Lair.<br>
				</font></p>
			<p><font color="#2c471c" face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="3">2. Officers need to take whatever necessary steps they need to in order to make themselves readily accessible to members of Huntress Lair.<br>
				</font></p>
			<p><font color="#2c471c" face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="3">3. Officer assistance will be much more flexible to a wider member population if they are able to maintain a variety of skill sets. </font></p>

While we are all here to support each other and we do our best to assist with the needs of our members. Help create the environment that makes people want to do this for you and don't expect it. Make friends. Do NOT ask repeatedly in guild chat for the service. In other words NO&nbsp;BEGGING in or out of the guild.<br>
