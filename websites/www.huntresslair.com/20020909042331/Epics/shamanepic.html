				</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Do not perform any of the quest turn-ins while using Form of the Great Bear. This quest will only trigger when proper True Spirit faction is detected by the quest NPCs. Reports have been received that being in Bear Form during epic-item turn-ins may bug the quest NPCs to misread your True Spirit faction and cause the quest trigger to fail!<br>
					<br>
				</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">There are several methods for beginning the quest, two of the more popular are: <br>

					<br>
				</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Go to Gornit's island in OOT, approx. loc 800, -5400, kill Capt Surestout (green con at level 54, one Envenomed Bolt kills him). A lesser spirit will spawn where he's killed, hail the spirit. <br>
					<br>
				</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">You say, 'Hail a lesser spirit' <br>

				</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">a lesser spirit says 'Did you take this person's life, shaman?'<br>
					<br>
				</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">You say, 'Yes' <br>
					<br>
				</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">a lesser spirit says 'Why have you taken this person's life? Did he threaten your life? Did you dislike him? Or was his death a profit to you in some way? </font><br>

					<br>
				</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">You say, 'Who are you?' <br>

					<br>
				</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">a lesser spirit says 'That is good. Take this gem. It is a part of us like the clouds to the sky and is a wonderful gift from the grandfather. Take this gem to where the humans gather to spoil the land and water. Some call it a port. There you will find one of us, a shaman like yourself. Give him the gem and perhaps he will tell you more of the spirits <br>

					<br>
				</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Bondl Felligan burps loudly in your face and says, 'Bah! Leave me be, fool! You have nothin' I want and I certainly have nothin' you want.' <br>
					<br>
				</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Give Bondl the 'tiny gem'. <br>

					<br>
				</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Next wait for him to move, follow him back out of the sewers onto the land outside, there he will stop and speak to you. <br>
					<br>
				</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Bondl Felligan says 'What!? You don't approve of me buyin' some drinks with this gem? Who the heck are you to offer me a gift and order me what to do with it? Is this some kinda conditional kindness? Well? Are you gonna let me buy some booze with this or not? <br>

					<br>
				</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">After this you can follow him to the Jade Tiger's Den or just go there yourself. Head up to the third floor, middle room and go inside. There you'll find a greater spirit waiting. <br>
					<br>
				</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Note: After giving him the gem once, simply going up to him and saying 'You can buy booze' at anytime will cause the spirit to spawn in the room. No need to travel back to Ocean of Tears, Field of Bones, Rathe Mountains or Butcherblock Mountains to initiate the quest again. <br>

					<br>
				</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">a greater spirit says 'As a shaman, spirits are known to you. They aid you if you pay them homage and respect the world around you. They also will bend to your will if you are powerful enough. We are a part of the entire universe and we exist because people believe and feel us. However [very few] know us in this form. To mortals we are but ideas, [wisps of consciousness] in an expanse of emptiness and as difficult to grasp as breath in Everfrost. <br>
					<br>
				</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">You say, 'What trust do you speak of?' <br>
					<br>
				</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">a greater spirit says 'Trust is the glue of the universe. When one trusts others to do their part, it allows them to focus on what they must do themselves. The trust that others have in us also gives us the confidence to do our parts effectively, thus maintaining harmony. When one becomes dissatisfied with his part and pursues his own desires, this is called greed. And greed destroys the glue of the universe. This is why we wished the bandits under the grass. <br>
					<br>
				</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">You say, 'What very few?' <br>

				</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">a greater spirit says 'There are only a handful of mortals we've judged worthy to be friends and, reluctantly, masters.

					<br>
				</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">We seek those with the wisdom, patience, and might to help us ensure the health of the cosmos. Whether you seek balance or personal power, this is important to you. <br>

					<br>
				</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">a greater spirit says 'It is difficult for mortals to grasp what we are for we are not material that can be held or consumed. We are the spirit that drives beings to do what beings do. The wolf lives to run and hunt. When you ask for his aid, his spirit enters your body and you 'become' wolf. The ox is the personification of endurance and when he enters your body, you do not become an ox, you become all that is ox. I myself am the spirit of understanding. <br>

Some are our friends who seek to help us in whatever goals we deem important. Some seek nothing more than to enslave and command us to do their bidding. We accept this and often make deals with those we realize are powerful enough to accomplish what needs to be done. To judge such individuals, we have prepared a test. We ask that before we enter into these contracts, the shaman walk the [path of the Heyokah]. <br>
					<br>
				</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">We see you may be worthy. Will you walk the path? You will be rewarded for your efforts, albeit grudgingly. <br>

The paths of patience, wisdom, and might. First, you must learn patience. Take this gem and go on a pilgrimage to an island in the great water the wasichu call Erud's Crossing. The Kerrans there are our allies and can show you to our next contact, Ooglyn. Give Ooglyn the gem and do what she asks. As you walk the path, remember what you've learned about trust.<br>

It won't effect the quest. <br>
					<br>
				</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Patiently wait at that location. Five different spirits or Heyokah will eventually spawn. Be patient. Your goal is to receive 'a broken arrow' from Abe, and a 'gem' from the Greater Spirit. As such, only the conversations with Abe and the Greater Spirit are presented here. Conversations with the others is merely 'fluff'. <br>

Although with the appointment of the new Arch Priest it appears mass may be discontinued altogether. I honestly hope so. I could attend many more classes as well as spend more time rubbing elbows with merchants at the bazaars. I think I'll have to miss tomorrow's mass as well.
