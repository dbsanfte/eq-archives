						<p><font color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2">Everquest has set up their guild process so that one person will hold the 'Guild Leadership' title. This guild [HL] follows this rule strictly for tag purposes, but with the leadership spread among FOUR Guild Members. These FOUR members form what we call 'The Leadership Council', which is the main basis for decision-making and problem solving within the guild.<br>
								<br>

								</b><br>
								The Leadership Council will help to keep the guild balanced on issues that are presented to them by the Officers of the Guild. </font><br>
							<br>
							<font color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2">All decisions that The Leadership Council makes will be the decision(s) of ALL of The Leadership Council Members.<br>
								<br>
								Occasionally, a subject that is being dealt with will be put on a 'hold' status if a Leadership Council Member is unavailable to cast his/her vote (or final decision). When the Leadership Council Member is able, the final vote and decision will be made and followed through on.<br>
								<br>
								The Leadership Council will be there to discuss and resolve issues within the Guild, including, but not limited to, disputes between Guild Members, and Everquest players. </font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Problems within the guild are to be brought to a </font><font color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2">Leadership Council's</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> attention.  </font><font color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><br>
								<br>
								The Leadership Council is not there to immediately stop what they are doing and rush to the aid of any guild member who needs help. The Leadership Council is there to offer their assistance to disputes that have gotten out of control.<br>
								<br>
								The Leadership Council will help to keep members focused during such activities as Guild Meetings, Guild Raids, and various other Guild activities and events.<br>
								<br>
								It is important that all of our Guild Members realize that we are ALL equal. Those of us that hold certain 'Titles' and 'Guild Leadership Roles' are no different then those who are just members. Titles and Roles don't make you any different then anyone else. It is important that you understand that others who hold these ranks are willing to take away their time, and use it to help keep the guild running and in focus.<br>
