				</b><br>
				Everquest has set up their guild process so that one person will hold the 'Guild Leadership' title. This guild [HL] follows this rule strictly for tag purposes, but with the leadership spread among FIVE Guild Members. These FIVE members form what we call 'The Leadership Council', which is the main basis for decision-making and problem solving within the guild.<br>
				<br>
			</font></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2" color="black"><b>The Leadership Council:<br>
					</b><br>
					The Leadership Council will help to keep the guild balanced on issues that are brought up, as well as disputes between guild members and Everquest players.<br>
					<br>
					All decisions that The Leadership Council makes will be the decision(s) of ALL of The Leadership Council Members.<br>
					<br>
					Occasionally, a subject that is being dealt with will be put on a 'hold' status if a Leadership Council Member is unavailable to cast his/her vote (or final decision). When the Leadership Council Member is able, the final vote and decision will be made and followed through on.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Officers:<br>
					</b><br>
					Guild Officers will be there to discuss and solve small disputes between Guild Members, and Everquest players.<br>
					<br>
					Officers are not there to immediately stop what they are doing and rush to the aid of any guild member who needs help. Officers are there to offer their assistance to disputes that have gotten out of control.<br>
					<br>
					Officers will have the ability to invite new members after they have informed The Leadership Council of the decision to do so. If The Leadership Council decides that this person is deserving enough to be brought into the guild, an invitation should be presented to that chosen person to join the guild.<br>
					<br>
					Officers will help to keep members focused during such activities as Guild Meetings, Guild Raids, and various other Guild activities and events.<br>
					<br>
					It is important that all of our Guild Members realize that we are ALL equal. Those of us that hold certain 'Titles' and 'Guild Leadership Roles' are no different then those who are just members. Titles and Roles don't make you any different then anyone else. It is important that you understand that others who hold these ranks are willing to take away their time, and use it to help keep the guild running and in focus.<br>

				</b><br>
				In order to keep the guild meetings short and to the point, we ask that all of you follow some simple rules while attending guild meetings. These are to ensure that all of us are focused on the subjects talked about, and that all of us can properly give input and information about anything discussed.<br>
				<br>

					<b>Other Players:</b><br>
					<br>
					We realize that sometimes other non-guild members might disrupt the meetings by shouting, or auctioning (be it on purpose or not). Please try to keep focused on the guild meeting if this does occur. Try NOT to reply or confront someone in anger during a meeting.<br>
					<br>
					Person to person, guild to guild, or person to guild-- ALL confrontations should try to be avoided whenever possible while a guild meeting is being conducted.<br>

		<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2" color="black"><b>Class, Races, and other Characters:</b><br>
				<br>
				There is a level 25 requirement in order to receive an invitation into Huntress Lair.<br>
				<br>
				There has also been much thought on how to implement second, third, fourth, or even fifth characters of members within the guild. We want to be sure that there is no discrimination between classes and/or levels.<br>
				<br>
				The following rules have been made to limit when a member may introduce their other characters into the guild. Trying to make a fair system for everyone is almost impossible with this issue, but we feel that this is one of the best ways for everyone.<br>
				<br>Please be aware that these rules tend to change often. These rules are set so that your 'Main Character' will be a significant level within the guild upon introduction of your 'Second Character'. Making your other non-main character(s) reach level 25 before the next character can be introduced was set up in order to assure that the amount of same-account characters within the guild stays at a balance.<br>
				<br>

		<blockquote>

		<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2" color="black"><b>Inviting New Members:</b><br>
				<br>
				There are a few minimal rules that we ask you to follow when interested in inviting an Everquest player join our guild. There will be many players over time that will show interest in joining our guild, and it is up to us to choose those players that we feel will make great members. The following is a few pointers and suggestions to filter out and find these great members.<br>
				<br>
			</font></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2" color="black"><b>Friends:</b><br>
					<br>
					Some of the best members are those people you are good friends with, be it in the game, or in real-life. Encourage the guild to socialize with your good friends, or those that you think would be good members. Chances are the hospitality will pay off enough that they will want to eventually join the guild.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Grouping:</b><br>
					<br>
					This is one of the best ways to find a great future guild member. It is easier to discover ones dedication, commitment, persona, and way of game-play while grouped. This is mainly due to the fact that many Everquest players get somewhat involved in trying to 'mold' themselves with a group they've recently joined, that it is relatively easier for the others in the group to decipher their attitude and persona more easily.</font><font color="black"><br>
					<br>
				</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2" color="black"><b>Attitude:</b><br>
					<br>
					This is another thing that can be helpful in deciding if someone would make a great member. You might get along with them, find them funny, or admire their actions for some particular reason or another. Either way, study what they do and how their attitude is, maybe you will find yourself asking him or her if they are interested in knowing more about our guild.</font><br>
				<br>
				<font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2" color="black"><b>Guild Tag:</b><br>
					<br>
					It is important that you make sure the person you think would make a great guild member is not already part of another guild. Many people use the '/anon' command, so making the mistake of asking someone in another guild to join our guild is not something that their guild members will easily forget. Finding that you've offended another guild is not fun, so make sure you are positive that a person is guildless before inquiring about his or her thoughts towards guild membership.</font><font color="black"><br>

This is key to receiving up to date information regarding the Guild. Council mailings regarding upcoming events and important information will be managed using the message board.<br>

					<b>Respect and Maturity</b>:<br>
				</font><font color="black"><br>
				</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2" color="black">Be a good representative of Huntress Lair to fellow members as well as people outside of our guild. It is very important that we all treat each other with respect and do our best to keep everyone happy at all times. Most importantly.....You must have fun . This is a game, not work or school. All members must have wonderful, playful, yet mature personalities and enjoy roleplaying. A sense of humor is preferred.<br>

					<b>Anonymous vs. Roleplay:</b><br>
				</font><font color="black"><br>
				</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2" color="black">Please no /anon. If you are not proud to be in Huntress Lair then please do not join or please remove your tag. Roleplay works as it still shows guild tag, but allows you to go anonymous, where as going /anonymous covers your guild tag.<br>

				</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2" color="black">It is all of our jobs to create the environment that makes us want to help people in the guild. Help out when you can, however, you will never be forced to. We also do not want anyone to feel bad if they cannot give a guildmember what they need or want. We've been there before and in the end it all works out somehow. Don't take advantage of people. If you have things to give away, consider the guild first.<br>
