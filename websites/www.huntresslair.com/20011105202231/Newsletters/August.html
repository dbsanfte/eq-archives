		<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">I have been doing some research on the needs of our members.  As you all</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> know Huntress Lair has grown both quickly and responsibly.  I would like t</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">o</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> continue to grow, however it is most important that we continue to do so</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> responsibly.  I'm sure you are all aware of a few races that are rare when</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> grouping. i.e. Cleric, Bards, Bards, Shammy's, etc.  If you take a look at</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> the member roster, you will see that we are in need a few of these races i</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">n</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> order to become more well rounded.  This will help optimize grouping</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> capabilities and ensure that future raids are better organized.  My reason</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> for bringing this to everyone's attention is due to the membership quality</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> we wish to maintain.  Huntress Lair prides itself in the maturity of it's</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> members and would like to continue that goal.  I think everyone can agree</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> that the best way to find quality, mature, fun loving people for the guild</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> is by word of mouth.  Your friends are our friends.  My friends are your</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> friends.  If any of you know someone that would enjoy a family such as</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> Huntress Lair then bring them to our attention.</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><br>

			</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">I have recently been communicating with Obsidian Guard to determine the</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> feasibility of forming an alliance between our two guilds.  I think we e</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">ach</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> have unique benefits that we can offer other and this will be a big </font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">turning</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> point in the growth of Huntress Lair.  As we progress into the upper </font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">levels,</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> our needs as individuals progress as well.

I believe a guild of Obsidian Guard's nature </font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">can</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> help us in those areas.
