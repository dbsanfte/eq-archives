							<p><font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">There are three general rules Huntress Lair will follow when leading its raids:<br>
								</font></p>
							<ul>
								<li><font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">We will plan all aspects of our raids ahead of time.</font>
								<li><font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">We will make clear decisions and goals and stick to them for the duration of our raids.</font>
								<li type="disc"><font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">We will delegate portions of the raid to trustworthy advisors to ensure its success.<br>
									</font>
							</ul>
							<p><font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b><u>Raid Planning:</u></b><br>
								</font></p>
							<p><font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Raids are slated for a certain time for a reason. We are dealing with people spanning a couple dozen time zones, so a raid slated for a certain time means we really want you to be there on time if you are planning to attend. If you need a ride, start asking half an hour in advance, or even an hour if it is a slow time of day. Better still, if you are planning to attend a raid the next day, get in position before you log the previous day. Nothing starts a raid out worse than having the raid members angry with each other over delays.<br>
								</font></p>
							<p><font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">If you are coming on a raid, bring enough food and water to last the raid. Last minute trips to town to buy just causes friction, and we want to enjoy ourselves on raids. If Foragers on the raid want to volunteer food and water, that is great, but do not count on it. As well, for those who will be playing primary (or sometimes secondary) tank, bring the spell components with you if you are going to be wanting symbols. There will probably be a time in the future when the guild itself will partially or fully cover these, but with the guild as new as it is, that time has not yet come, and we cannot expect our Clerics and Enchanters to cover the cost of Symbol and Rune components for the entire raid for the entire evening. And there will of course be exceptions to this (ie the Plane of Air and fish rolls) but those exceptions will be announced in advance.<br>
								</font></p>
							<p><font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Enjoy yourselves. We do these raids to speed experience in our guild, to get items that our guild members want, but for the most part, we do these raids because it is something we can all do together, and in the process grow as a guild. We have no need to fall into the large guild mentality of 'grim raiding', where we raid to the point of losing the enjoyment, in hopes of someday gaining high goals. We are a small guild, and we will likely never be big enough to worry about the largest challenges on Norrath, and I personally like it that way. We will do what is within our abilities, and hopefully push our abilities to do more in time.<br>
									<br>
									<b><u>Goals:</u></b><br>
								</font></p>
							<p><font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">While we will try our best to ensure things go as smoothly as possible, we are as yet a small guild. We cannot guarantee that you will not die on a raid, and we might not have a high level Cleric around to Res you fully. We ask that you be willing to accept that we will do our best to Res, recover corpses, and get you out of the raid zone once the raid is over, but if you lose some experience to a lower level Res, we ask that you accept that as part of the raid process.<br>
								</font></p>
							<p><font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">We may be raiding for some particular goal (ie for an Epic piece). If this is done, we will inform you in advance that the raid is for a particular purpose, so that you can understand that side trips for other particular loot may not be on our list of things to do that day. We want to be a unified guild, and we do ask that you support your guild members in their goals, just as we want to support you in your goals. We do ask though that you be patient in your goals. We cannot help everybody at once, and we may not be able to assist you with certain things at this time, due to our present guild strength (ie getting a Spiroc Wingblade).<br>
								</font></p>
							<ul>
								<li type="disc"><font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Loot and looting rights is a guild breaker, so we ask that you accept that we are not perfect. <a href="http://www.huntresslair.com/Loot.html">Standard loot rules</a> have been established for Huntress Lair Raids.<br>
									</font>
							</ul>
							<p><font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b><u>Raid Advisors:</u></b><br>
								</font></p>
							<p><font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">There will be a raid leader, and depending on how many groups, there may be group leaders assigned too. It might not be you this time, but that does not mean you should not listen to the leaders. They may not keep you alive, but if they do not, it will be so the rest of the raid will live. We regret it if you die, but by not listening, you will probably die anyways, and take everybody else with you. The raid leader is responsible for the over all goals of the raid, while the group leaders are responsible for the welfare of the group they are assigned to. They may need to move group members around in order to maximize the efficiency of the raid, and please do not be offended if your group ends up losing in the trade. We ask you keep a long view, knowing that we are doing our best to make sure the raid is a success. Our raid leader will:<br>
								</font></p>
							<ul>
								<li type="disc"><font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Find a location and learn as much as possible about it including maps, loot lists, and hands on experience.</font>
								<li type="disc"><font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Plan a goal for the raid.</font>
								<li type="disc"><font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">State the raid's specific purpose, loot rules, and who can attend.</font>
								<li type="disc"><font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Advertise the raid on various guild bulletin boards and in game.<br>
									</font>
							</ul>
							<p><font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Proper delegation is also key to a solid raid. Huntress Lair will assign the following roles to trusted volunteers:<br>
								</font></p>
							<ul>
								<li type="disc"><font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><u>Loot Master:</u> This person will make sure that all items are announced with stats and who will roll on it. They will handle all questions or problems as it relates to loot. Since loot is generally important in peoples minds, assign it to someone you know is capable of handling the issue. A loot master should have a good understanding, and ideally a list of what drops can occur.</font>
								<li type="disc"><font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><u>Transportation Officer:</u> They coordinate the arrival of all those who wish to attend. The transportation officer is not solely responsible for moving people to the raid site, just making sure that they are on the way. This job is best assigned to a druid or wizard.</font>
								<li type="disc"><font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><u>Puller / Scout:</u> A monk and / or a rogue work well as scouts. They can pave a way through a dungeon, finding out what the various pulls will include. A fighter, paladin, shadowknight and ranger can also make good pullers. An experienced pull team is very important.<br>
									</font>
								<li type="disc"><font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><u>Primary and Secondary Assist:</u> Generally your biggest and toughest melee will act as the primary assist. Make sure to announce to all in attendance that they are to set up a hotbox to assist the primary assist. Should the primary die, have a secondary assist planned out.<br>
									</font>
								<li type="disc"><font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><u>Advisors</u>: Advisors are players that are experienced with the dungeon and with raiding. They will help give you information or make decisions but will not attempt to take control of the raid. Pick people you trust and have worked with before.<br>
									</font>
							</ul>
							<p><font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The first group we assemble when Huntress Lair assembles its raiding party, will be our command group. This command group will consist of the following roles; the raid leader, a scout, a puller and primary assist, raid advisors, and any accessory classes such as evacers, healers or mezzers. This group will act as the command team for the rest of the raid. It determines where the raid heads, and what mobs the raid pulls. This is the group that makes all the decisions as to where to go and what to kill.<br>
								</font></p>
							<p><font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b><u>Basic Raid Guildelines</u>:</b></font></p>
							<ul>
								<li type="disc"><font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Prepare to follow directions the raid leader(s) give the groups to the letter -- errant group members will only end up costing a lot of deaths and down time during the raid.</font>
								<li type="disc"><font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Prepare to listen the the raid leader(s) very closely throughout the entire time you are on the raid - if you want to visit and chat with friends, this isn't the time to do it.</font>
								<li type="disc"><font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Be prepared to hear from a raid leader, directly, if you aren't following directions specifically and never take it as a personal attack. Learn from what they tell you and let the rest roll off your back...if you can't, be prepared to be TL'd out.</font>
								<li type="disc"><font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Be prepared and willing to die. If you aren't and you think it's going to be too hairy, ask for a TL out of the zone from a wizard in attendance.</font>
								<li type="disc"><font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Be as easy to work with during CR and res'ing as possible. Raids are very stressful if things go haywire and require much patience and willingness to get back on track from all raid members.</font>
								<li type="disc"><font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Remember you will not always get experience or items. </font>
								<li type="disc"><font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Make yourself invaluable. Play your class to the very very best of your ability and be considerate of people around you.<br>
