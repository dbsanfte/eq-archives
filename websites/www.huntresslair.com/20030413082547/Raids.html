							<p><font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Raids are a process that helps a guild grow. Huntress Lair will do what is within its abilities, and push our ability to do more as it grows. There are three general rules Huntress Lair will follow when leading its raids:<br>
								</font></p>
							<ul>
								<li><font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">We will plan all aspects of our raids ahead of time.</font>
								<li><font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">We will make clear decisions and goals and stick to them for the duration of our raids.</font>
								<li type="disc"><font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">We will delegate portions of the raid to trustworthy advisors to ensure its success.<br>
									</font>
							</ul>
							<p><font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b><u>Raid Planning:</u></b><br>
								</font></p>
							<p><font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Raids are slated for a certain time for important reasons.</font><font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Your fellow guild mates want you to be there on time if you are planning to attend. If you need a ride, start asking at least a half an hour in advance, or sooner is possible. It is even a good idea to get in position before you log the previous day. </font><br>
								<br>
								<font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">If you are coming on a raid, bring enough food and water to last the raid. For those who will be playing a primary caster, bring spell components with you and the guild bank will reimburse you for the cost of those components used. (i.e. Clerics and Enchanters using Symbol and Rune components)<br>
								</font><font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><br>
									<a href="http://www.huntresslair.com/Loot.html">Standard loot rules</a> have been established for general Huntress Lair Raids.</font><br>
								<br>
								<font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b><u>Goals:</u></b><br>
								</font></p>
							<p><font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Huntress Lair raids specific goals in mind, as well as just for fun. Epic mobs and providing our membesr with equipment are two of the guilds major goals for raiding. For more information about how Huntress Lair handles Epics please visit our <a href="http://www.huntresslair.com/epics/epic.html" target="Home">Epic&nbsp;Center</a>.</font></p>
							<p><font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The specific purpose of a raid is always announced in advance. Information about our raids can be found in the <a href="http://pub59.ezboard.com/fhuntresslairfrm27">Calendar of  Events</a> forum of our message board. </font></p>
							<p><font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">We ask that you support your guild mates in their goals, just as we want to support you in your goals. We do ask that you be patient in your goals. Not everyone can be helped at once. For information regarding the guilds Epic capabilities please review <a href="http://www.huntresslair.com/Epics/EpicAbility.html" target="Home">Huntress Lair's Epic abilities</a>.<br>
								</font><br>
								<font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b><u>Raid Advisors:</u></b><br>
								</font></p>
							<p><font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">There will be a raid leader and usually group leaders assigned to the raid. The raid leader is responsible for the over all goals of the raid, while the group leaders are responsible for the welfare of the group they are assigned to. Group members may need to be moved around in order to maximize the efficiency of the raid. Do not be offended if your group ends up losing in the trade. Our raid leader will:<br>
								</font></p>
							<ul>
								<li type="disc"><font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Find a location and learn as much as possible about it including maps, loot lists, and hands on experience.</font>
								<li type="disc"><font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Plan a goal for the raid.</font>
								<li type="disc"><font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">State the raid's specific purpose, loot rules, and who can attend.</font>
								<li type="disc"><font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Advertise the raid in advance on the <a href="http://pub59.ezboard.com/fhuntresslairfrm27">Calendar of  Events</a> forum of our message board and in game.<br>
									</font>
							</ul>
							<p><font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Proper delegation is also key to a solid raid. Huntress Lair will assign the following roles to trusted members:<br>
								</font></p>
							<ul>
								<li type="disc"><font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><u>Puller / Scout</u></font>:&nbsp;<font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The main puller will be determined by the raid leader and announced prior to the start of the raid.</font><font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><br>
									</font>
								<li type="disc"><font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><u>Primary and Secondary Assist:</u> Generally our biggest and toughest melee will act as the primary assist. These roles will be announced to all in attendance prior to the start of the raid. Should the Primary Assist die, the Secondary Assist then becomes the Primary Assist, etc.<br>
									</font>
								<li type="disc"><font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><u>Group Leaders</u>: Group Leaders will help give you information and/or help make decisions but will not attempt to take control of the raid.</font>
								<li type="disc"><font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><u>Loot Master</u>: The main looter will make sure that all items are announced with stats. They will handle all questions or problems as it relates to loot. The loot master will have a full understanding of Huntress Lair loot rules, in order for them to be followed.<br>
									</font>
							</ul>
							<p><font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The first group we assemble when Huntress Lair assembles its raiding party, will be the command group. This command group usually (but not always) consists of the following roles; the raid leader, a puller and primary assist, and any accessory classes such as evacers, healers or mezzers. This group will act as the command team for the rest of the raid. It determines where the raid heads, and what mobs the raid pulls. This is the group that makes all the decisions as to where to go and what to kill.<br>
								</font></p>
							<p><font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b><u>Basic Raid Guildelines</u>:</b></font></p>
							<ul>
								<li type="disc"><font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Prepare to follow directions the raid or group leader(s) gives. Errant group members will only end up costing a lot of deaths and down time during the raid.</font>
								<li type="disc"><font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Prepare to listen the the raid leader(s) very closely throughout the entire time you are on the raid - if you want to visit and chat with friends, a raid is not the time to do so.</font>
								<li type="disc"><font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Be prepared to hear from a raid or group leader, directly, if you are not following directions and never take it as a personal attack. Learn from and respect what they tell you.</font>
								<li type="disc"><font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Be prepared and willing to die.</font>
								<li type="disc"><font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Be as easy to work and as patient as possible during a CR. Raids can be very stressful and require much patience   from all raid members.</font>
								<li type="disc"><font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Remember you will not always get experience or items. </font>
								<li type="disc"><font size="2" color="#ffcc66" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Make yourself invaluable. Play your class to the very very best of your ability and be considerate of people around you.<br>
