              <span class="sectionHdr">New Member Requirements:</span><BR>
              <BR>
              All standing members of the incoming four guilds are automatically 
              allowed membership to this one. (this line can be removed after 
              a period of transition). New members must complete an application 
              for membership. They must have references from current members. 
              They must read our rules and agree to them. And they must register 
              on the forum so we know they are aware of it's existence. Admittance 
              to the guild will be voted on by council after review of the application. 
              Real life relatives and friends of current members will not be required 
              to complete an application. They will however be required to read 
              and agree to the rules and register on the forum. New members will 
              be placed on a probationary period and thier status will be reviewed 
              at the end of that period.<BR>
              <BR>
              If a member who has passed the probationary period wishes to have 
              alternate characters in the guild, they must request an invite for 
              those characters by posting in the appropriate forums, listing the 
              alternates they wish to have guilded.

              <span class="sectionHdr">Member Rules:</span><BR>
              <BR>
              1. You will abide by Verant's Play Nice Policies (linked and summarized 
              below):<BR>
              everquest.station.sony.co...onduct.jsp<BR>
              a. You may not steal kills.<BR>
              b. You may not ninjaloot.<BR>
              c. You must comply with arbitration for contested spawns.<BR>
              d. You may not use any sexually explicit, harmful, threatening, 
              abusive, defamatory, obscene, hateful, racially or ethnically offensive 
              language.<BR>
              e. You will not harass or threaten other players.<BR>
              f. You may not disrupt the normal playability of a zone or area.<BR>
              g. You may not defraud other players.<BR>
              h. You may not intentionally cause experience loss to another player, 
              such as by &quot;training&quot; them.<BR>
              i. You may not abuse other players, customer service representatives, 
              or the game system. <BR>
              <BR>
              <span class="bodyCopyB">Note:</span> In reference to the rule about 
              language. This is verbatim from Verant's Code of Conduct. Please 
              read this carefully &quot;sexually explicit, harmful, threatening, 
              abusive, defamatory, obscene, hateful, racially or ethinically offensive&quot;. 
              In other words &quot;hurtful to others&quot;. We will not allow 
              this in /say (in public areas), /ooc, /guildsay, /shout or /auction. 
              What you say to your group or in private tells is up to you. What 
              you say to the rest of the server reflects upon this guild. If your 
              language is such that complaints are made against you, you will 
              be warned by an officer. Outbursts of frustration, or innuendo in 
              /guildsay are allowed up to a point. What that point is, is a personal 
              meter of each player in this guild. Everyone has the right to say 
              something if they are offended by what someone else has said, as 
              long as it is handled through the proper channels and not used to 
              attack a fellow guildmate. The officers of this guild will not be 
              the &quot;language monitors&quot; of /guildsay. Only extreme cases 
              and those that foster complaint will be &quot;policed&quot;. Some 
              topics of conversation that may be acceptable to the &quot;late 
              nighters&quot; may not be acceptable to those that play at other 
              times. Please handle any requests to curb your language or change 
              your topics with respect and courtesy.<BR>
              <BR>
              2. The use of anonymous status is discouraged unless on a guild 
              raid. Normal status is the preferred status so the guild is aware 
              where the members are located. This is to encourage grouping and 
              assisting each other within the Guild. If you must hide your class 
              and level, do so with /roleplay so you are still visible to the 
              guild. <BR>
              <BR>
              3. The selling/buying of characters or items on Ebay or any other 
              &quot;online auction&quot; venue will not be allowed.<BR>
              <BR>
              4. You will abide by council / guild leader decisions. You will 
              also abide by the Raid Advisor decisions during raids. If you feel 
              that a decision was made that was in error or unfair against you, 
              you have the right to request arbitration from the council on that 
              issue. For further rules in regards to raids, see the Raid Rules.<BR>
              <BR>
              5. You will bring to the attention any infractions of these rules 
              to the council and/or guild leader. We will not risk the disbanding 
              of the guild over one player's actions.<BR>
              <BR>
              6. Inter-guild disagreements among players will not be aired on 
              the /guildchat channel. If you have a problem with another guildmate, 
              you have the right to request the guild leader and/or council members 
              to arbitrate for you. 
              <hr noshade>
              <span class="sectionHdr">Disciplinary Actions:</span><BR>
              <BR>
              We realize that everyone makes mistakes. All infractions against 
              the rules will be reviewed by the leadership to decide action. In 
              some cases, a simple apology will suffice. In extreme cases, a member's 
              actions may result in immediate removal from the guild. In the instance 
              where a member has been warned more than once about breaking the 
              rules, a vote will be held to decide if that player will be allowed 
              to remain in the guild. Ignorance of the rules of this guild will 
              NOT be used as a reason to excuse actions that are contrary to what 
              this guild is all about. Disciplinary action can include private 
              or public warnings, temporary removal from the guild (suspension), 
              or complete removal from the guild. In the event that a member's 
              actions have resulted in suspension or removal, the reasons for 
              such a decision will be made public by the council. Disciplinary 
              action may be appealed by posting on the members board for Council 
              review. 
              <hr noshade>
              <span class="sectionHdr"> Guild Leadership Structure:</span><BR>
              <BR>
              The Council will be comprised of 4 senior officers (one of which 
              will wear the guild leader tag in game) and 12 advisors (3 officers 
              from each of the 4 founding guilds). Additionally , there will be 
              5 Raid Leader Advisors. They may be members of the council and/or 
              volunteers from the general membership population. In the event 
              that any one of the advisors or senior officers decides to step 
              down, the open position will be filled after a vote has been held.

              4. Any Guild Leader who is deemed by the other leadership members
