                typically need certain classes to succeed. These essential classes 
                may include clerics, monks,<BR>
                enchanters or others. Some planes raids need a &quot;port-up&quot; 
                wizard for each group. Hence, the essential classes are selected 
                first,<BR>
                with priority based on membership, age, and experience. We will 
                go outside the guild for these classes should the Raid Leader<BR>

                <span class="bodyCopyHdr">A. Quest Items:</span> <BR>
                <BR>
                1. When a quest item drops, the people who can use the item to 
                complete the quest get to roll on it. <BR>
                <BR>
                a) The winner gets looting rights to that item but only for the 
                purpose of completing their quest.<BR>
                <BR>
                b) They cannot sell, trade or bequest the looting rights off.<BR>
                <BR>
                c) The item is not theirs at this stage, it still belongs to the 
                entire raid party.<BR>
                <BR>
                d) If the high roller will not use the item for his/her quest 
                then the looting rights are passed on to the next highest roller.<BR>
                <BR>
                e) If none of the people who actually need the item for a quest 
                will use it then the entire raid party gets to roll on it (a seperate 
                roll<BR>
                from the initial roll) and the winner of the roll can sell off 
                the looting rights if so desired. At this point the quest item 
                is effectively<BR>
                owned by the winner and is no longer the property of the raiding 
                party.<BR>
                <BR>
                f) Note that raiders closest to completion of a given quest may 
                be given priority on a quest item drop at the descretion of the 
                Raid<BR>
                Leader.<BR>
                <BR>
                g) All quest gems that drop will be handed over to the guild gem 
                mule. Gems will be distributed on a first-come first-serve basis,<BR>
                the only requirement is that the asking member has the matching 
                armor piece first.<BR>
                <BR>
                2. Winners of Quest Items do not lose or forgo their right to 
                random roll for a class-specific or non-class-specific loot item.<BR>

                B. Gem Drops:</span><BR>
                <BR>
                After the raid is paid for, the Raid Leader will include the rest 
                of the acquired gems as loot. These gems will be randomed off 
                at the<BR>
                end of the raid , up to three at a time, to the raid members who 
                did not get a loot item, quest or otherwise, on that raid. <BR>
                <span class="bodyCopyHdr"><BR>
                C. Coinage Drops:</span><BR>
                <BR>
                1. Coin collected by each Group Looter will be split amongst the 
                Group at the end of the raid.<BR>

                <span class="bodyCopyHdr">D. Class Specific Armor and Weapons:</span><BR>
                <BR>
                1. Randoms: Randomed among the appropriate class who are on the 
                raid, subject to the One-Per-Raider rule below.<BR>
                <BR>
                2. Pre-Possession of No Drop Items: If the item is no drop and 
                you already possess the item, you do not roll for it (obviously).<BR>
                <BR>
                3. Default winners: <BR>
                <BR>
                a) If you have not won an item (class-specific or otherwise), 
                perhaps by choice or due to the scarcity of the remaining class 
                items<BR>
                you lack, and<BR>
                b) If all others of your class have won one or more items (class-specific 
                or otherwise) on the raid, and<BR>
                c) Should a class-specific item you lack then drop, the item will 
                default to you or be randomed between you and any other<BR>
                class-specific raider in a similar situation.<BR>
                <BR>
                4. Passing: Passing on random rolls is allowed.<BR>
                <span class="bodyCopyHdr"><BR>
                E. Non-Class-Specific Loot Items:</span><BR>
                <BR>
                1. The classes that can use the item get to roll for it, subject 
                to the One-Per-Raider rule below and subject to the Raid Leader's<BR>
                decision on whether certain classes can get greater benefit from 
                the item than others.<BR>
                <BR>
                For example, a Cloak of Flames is ALL ALL regarding race and class, 
                yet obviously this item should be randomed amongst the melee<BR>
                classes for it's Haste effect.<BR>
                <BR>
                2. The Raid Leader will have the final say in who rolls for non-class-specific 
                items.<BR>
                <BR>
                <span class="bodyCopyHdr">F. Un-Useable and/or Un-Wanted Items:</span> 
                <BR>
                <BR>
                1. Should a class specific, tradable item be dropped in the absence 
                of any raiders of that particular class, or, should a<BR>
                non-class-specific, tradable item drop that is un-wanted by all 
                in attendance, the item will,<BR>
                <BR>
                a) default to the Raid Leader as a &quot;sellable item&quot; to 
                further defray the costs of the current or future raids, or,<BR>
                <BR>
                b) be randomed off to some or all in attendance at the Raid Leader's 
                descretion, or,<BR>
                <BR>
                c) be saved to present to a guild member that can use the item 
                at the Raid Leader's descretion<BR>

                3. The rotation will begin anew for your class for class-specific 
                items once Rule II.G.1. has been met, and for all classes for<BR>
                non-class-specific items once Rule II.G.2. has been met.<BR>
                <BR>
