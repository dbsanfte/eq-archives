              <P><span class="sectionHdr">Attention:</span> <span class="bodyCopyB">When 
                you join this guild it will be assumed that you have read and 
                agree to follow the rules below. If you have any questions about 
                any of the following, please speak to a guild officer. </span>
              <hr noshade>
              <p class="sectionHdr">What is Etheios?</p>
              <p>Etheios is a family and a team. We strive to provide a home for 
                our members to prosper. We firmly believe that by advancing the 
                guild first, we advance ourselves as individuals. We believe in 
                an equitable balance between the help we provide the guild with 
                the help we receive. </p>
              <p>Everything you say and do as an individual becomes what people 
                think of Etheios. We want to be known as a guild whose members 
                play maturely, expressing ourselves without relying on foul language 
                or insults. We want to be known as a guild of courteous members. 
                Not only do we believe in and support Verants &quot;Play Nice 
                Policies&quot;, we demand that our standards of honor and fair 
                play extend above and beyond the guidelines of acceptable in-game 
                behavior. </p>
              <p>The bonds which will make Etheios endure and prosper are the 
                bonds of friendship and family. In the game, most of us start 
                as strangers to one another. Its the responsibility of all members 
                to close the gaps which make us strangers. No member of Etheios 
                should accept that they are falling through the cracks and nobody 
                is noticing them. Take matters into your own hands to make friends, 
                introduce yourself around, and show yourself as the fun individual 
                that you are. Speak up, get involved, and don't be just a name 
                in the guildlist. </p>
              <hr noshade>
              <p class="sectionHdr">Joining Etheios:</p>
              <p>If you wish to join Etheios you need to post something about 
                yourself on our message board at http://pub79.ezboard.com/betheios 
                and contact an officer in game. We encourage you to meet and group 
                with Etheios members. There may be restrictions in place regarding 
                new applications (such as levels or class) and if you are not 
                subject to those restrictions the link to the application form 
                will be emailed to you. Applicants who can provide references 
                or sponsors from within the guild will have priority over those 
                who don't. Once your application has been sent back to us, the 
                guild officers will vote and a decision will usually be made within 
                2 weeks. If you are approved you will join Etheios as a probationary 
                member. The probation period is currently 30 days.</p>
              <p>Members on probation will not be allowed to sponsor new members. 
                Nor will they be allowed to bring alternate characters in to the 
                guild. They will be required to add their member information to 
                the Guild Roster. Failure to do so by the end of the 30-day probationary 
                period will result in a denial for full membership and removal 
                from the guild.</p>
              <p>Exceptions: Current members of Etheios who have real life family 
                or friends who are interested in joining may request the link 
                to the Etheios application. Those new applicants will not be subject 
                to any level or class restrictions but will still be considered 
                probationary for the first 30 days. </p>
              <p>Once you have completed your probationary period, you may get 
                your alternate characters into the guild by adding them to the 
                Members Roster first and then requesting an invite from an officer 
                online.</p>
              <p>Etheios will not support a revolving door policy. We feel that 
                wearing the Etheios guild tag is an honor and the removal of that 
                tag is not something to be taken lightly. We encourage our members 
                to contact the officers if they are having a problem within the 
                guild that makes them want to leave. We care about our members 
                and will make the effort to resolve issues if we can. If you wish 
                to apply to another guild while still a member of Etheios, you 
                must inform an Etheios officer and provide your reasons. We regret 
                the loss of any of our members and would hope to work things out. 
                Every case will be viewed on an individual basis and the actions 
                taken as a result of someone applying to another guild will be 
                at the discretion of the council.</p>
              <p>If you leave the guild and then change your mind, you will be 
                required to re-apply for membership. That means filling out an 
                application and waiting for the results of a council vote. If 
                you have more than one character in the guild, you may be asked 
                to remove all of them. If you wish to remove just one character, 
                you must notify the council in advance and provide a reason.</p>
              <hr noshade>
              <p class="sectionHdr"> Member Rules:</p>
              <p>1. You will abide by Verant's Play Nice Policies (linked and 
                summarized below):<br>
                <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/support/policies/conduct.jsp">http://everquest.station.sony.com/support/policies/conduct.jsp</a><br>
                a. You may not steal kills.<br>
                b. You may not ninjaloot.<br>
                c. You must comply with arbitration for contested spawns.<br>
                d. You may not use any sexually explicit, harmful, threatening, 
                abusive, defamatory, obscene, hateful, racially or ethnically 
                offensive language.<br>
                e. You will not harass or threaten other players.<br>
                f. You may not disrupt the normal playability of a zone or area.<br>
                g. You may not defraud other players.<br>
                h. You may not intentionally cause experience loss to another 
                player, such as by &quot;training&quot; them.<br>
                i. You may not abuse other players, customer service representatives, 
                or the game system. </p>
              <p>Note: In reference to the rule about language. This is verbatim 
                from Verant's Code of Conduct. Please read this carefully &quot;sexually 
                explicit, harmful, threatening, abusive, defamatory, obscene, 
                hateful, racially or ethinically offensive&quot;. In other words 
                &quot;hurtful to others&quot;. We will not allow this in /say 
                (in public areas), /ooc, /guildsay, /shout or /auction. What you 
                say to your group or in private tells is up to you. What you say 
                to the rest of the server reflects upon this guild. If your language 
                is such that complaints are made against you, you will be warned 
                by an officer. Outbursts of frustration, or innuendo in /guildsay 
                are allowed up to a point. What that point is, is a personal meter 
                of each player in this guild. Everyone has the right to say something 
                if they are offended by what someone else has said, as long as 
                it is handled through the proper channels and not used to attack 
                a fellow guildmate. The officers of this guild will not be the 
                &quot;language monitors&quot; of /guildsay. Only extreme cases 
                and those that foster complaint will be &quot;policed&quot;. Some 
                topics of conversation that may be acceptable to the &quot;late 
                nighters&quot; may not be acceptable to those that play at other 
                times. Please handle any requests to curb your language or change 
                your topics with respect and courtesy.</p>
              <p>2. The use of anonymous status is discouraged unless on a guild 
                raid. Normal status is the preferred status so the guild is aware 
                where the members are located. This is to encourage grouping and 
                assisting each other within the Guild. If you must hide your class 
                and level, do so with /roleplay so you are still visible to the 
                guild. Note: If you feel like you need to take a break from the 
                guild but do not wish to leave it, the Etheios leadership strongly 
                supports the use of /anon and the turning off of guildchat. We 
                understand that sometimes it is nice to be able to step away from 
                the pressures of being in a guild and would prefer you use this 
                option instead of removing yourself from the guild. </p>
              <p>3. The selling/buying of characters or items on Ebay or any other 
                &quot;online auction&quot; venue will not be allowed.</p>
              <p>4. You will abide by council / guild leader decisions. You will 
                also abide by the Raid Leader's decisions during raids. If you 
                feel that a decision was made that was in error or unfair against 
                you, you have the right to request arbitration from the council 
                on that issue. </p>
              <p>5. You will bring to the attention any infractions of these rules 
                to the council and/or guild leader. We will not risk the disbanding 
                of the guild over one player's actions.</p>
              <p>6. Inter-guild disagreements among players will not be aired 
                on the /guildchat channel. If you have a problem with another 
                guildmate, take it to tells and if necessary contact an officer 
                online to help you deal with the problem.</p>
              <p>7. You will maintain your information in the Guild Roster. Periodically 
                the council will review the Guild Roster and any member online 
                who is not listed will be suspended from the guild.</p>
              <hr noshade>
              <p class="sectionHdr">Disciplinary Actions:</p>
              <p>We realize that everyone makes mistakes. All infractions against 
                the rules will be reviewed by the leadership to decide action. 
                In some cases, a simple apology will suffice. In extreme cases, 
                a member's actions may result in immediate removal from the guild. 
                In the instance where a member has been warned more than once 
                about breaking the rules, a vote will be held to decide if that 
                player will be allowed to remain in the guild. Ignorance of the 
                rules of this guild will NOT be used as a reason to excuse actions 
                that are contrary to what this guild is all about. Disciplinary 
                action can include private or public warnings, temporary removal 
                from the guild (suspension), or complete removal from the guild. 
                In the event that a member's actions have resulted in suspension 
                or removal, the reasons for such a decision will be made public 
                by the council. Disciplinary action may be appealed by posting 
                on the members board for Council review.</p>
              <hr noshade>
              <p class="sectionHdr"> Guild Leadership Structure:</p>
              <p>The Guild Leadership will be comprised of a High Council and 
                regular Council. Additionally, there will be recognized guild 
                Raid Leaders and Class Advisors. Raid Leaders and Class Advisors 
                may be members of the council and/or volunteers from the general 
                membership population.</p>
              <hr noshade>
              <p class="sectionHdr"> High Council Responsibilties:</p>
              <p>1. The Guild Leader (current in-game holder of guild leader tag) 
                cannot, under any circumstances, disband the guild. If the current 
                guild leader wishes to step down, the leadership will be handed 
                to one of the other High Council members.</p>
              <p>2. The High Council will be available to the council to discuss 
                issues concerning the running of the guild.</p>
              <p>3. The High Council will have the power to remove any member 
                they feel is not in keeping with the spirit of the guild or that 
                has broken the rules. Such an action will be answerable to the 
                other High Council members.</p>
              <p>4. High Council members may only be voted out of or appointed 
                to office by a decision made by the other High Council members.</p>
              <hr noshade>
              <p class="sectionHdr">Council Responsibilities:</p>
              <p>1. The Council members will be responsible for handling the day 
                to day running of the guild.</p>
              <p>2. The Council members will make themselves available to all 
                members for arbitrating disputes, answering questions and making 
                on the spot decisions as they arise. </p>
              <p>3. The Council members will participate in all discussions concering 
                the running of the guild.</p>
              <p>4. The Council members will be responsible for reviewing new 
                member applications and will vote on each new member.</p>
              <p>5. The Council members will have the power, in extreme cases, 
                to remove a member from the guild. Such an action will be reviewed 
                by other leadership members. If it is found that a council member 
                has abused this power, they will be removed from the guild themselves.</p>
              <p>6. Council membership will be at the discretion of the High Council. 
                They will be responsible for appointing new council members or 
                removing current ones.</p>
