              <p>Etheios is a family and a team. We strive to provide a home for 
                our members to prosper. We firmly believe that by advancing the 
                guild first, we advance ourselves as individuals. We believe in 
                an equitable balance between the help we provide the guild with 
                the help we receive. </p>
              <p>Everything you say and do as an individual becomes what people 
                think of Etheios. We want to be known as a guild whose members 
                play maturely, expressing ourselves without relying on foul language 
                or insults. We want to be known as a guild of courteous members. 
                Not only do we believe in and support Verants "Play Nice Policies", 
                we demand that our standards of honor and fair play extend above 
                and beyond the guidelines of acceptable in-game behavior. </p>
              <p>The bonds which will make Etheios endure and prosper are the 
                bonds of friendship and family. In the game, most of us start 
                as strangers to one another. Its the responsibility of all members 
                to close the gaps which make us strangers. No member of Etheios 
                should accept that they are falling through the cracks and nobody 
                is noticing them. Take matters into your own hands to make friends, 
                introduce yourself around, and show yourself as the fun individual 
                that you are. Speak up, get involved, and don't be just a name 
                in the guildlist. </p>
