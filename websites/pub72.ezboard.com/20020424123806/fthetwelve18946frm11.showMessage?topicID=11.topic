They eventually met up with Alchork, Savrarigas, and Zerapheus who introduced them to all of their new friends, The Legendary Twelve. This was a mighty band of people that hunted the lands together. They took on Inny, Sev, Gore, Talendor, Rumble, Trak, Rhag and others. They won some and they lost some. This group ate, drank and quested together.<br>
But, Connu did all this with a sadness in her heart. It just wasn't the same accomplishing something with new faces as it was with the old. When you accomplish things with people who have watched you grow and with whom you have watched grow, the victory is much sweeter. You know the trials and tribulations they  have overcome to get where they are today. You can actually participate in the celebration because you have traveled the road together.<br>
Connu gathered up her meager possessions and stuffed them into her backpack. She clung briefly to Zarkril, kissed him goodbye and wished him well in his new home. She asked Zarkril to tell all of their new friends goodbye for her and she hoped they would understand.<br>
Connu picked up her scimitar and headed down the path. Each step she took seemed a little lighter and she realized it was because she was headed in the right direction.<br>
Connu knew her greatest test was yet to come. There was one big obstacle that stood between her and her homeland. It would be the fight of her life. She would have to take on the mightiest giant of all and walk away victorious. This giant was a rare spawn and would kill to keep people from leaving Stormhammer.<br>
Connu made her camp and waited for him to spawn. She knew her mighty scimitar and the great Tunare would not let her down. Send in the giant. Send in the wretched beast. Connu was ready to take on the great &quot;Sony&quot; and win, for she wanted to go home.<br>
As she drifted off to sleep, she prayed that her &quot;old&quot; family would forgive her wandering ways and welcome her back into the fold. She also prayed that her &quot;new&quot; family would understand and not hold any ill will towards her.<br>

I want to thank each and every one of you for making me a part of your &quot;family&quot;. However, my heart just isn't into playing Connu on this server. I have requested that Connu be returned to TM. <p><a href=http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=79923>Connu </a> </br>Shizen- Preserver of the 58th Glade/Tarew Marr</br>Bloodsinger-
