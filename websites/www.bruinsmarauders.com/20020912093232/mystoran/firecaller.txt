[Tue May 29 22:29:36 2001] LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...
[Tue May 29 22:30:38 2001] You are no longer a wolf.

[Tue May 29 22:31:44 2001] Firiona Vie says, 'Please take care of the young ones.'
[Tue May 29 22:31:48 2001] You begin casting Greater Wolf Form.
[Tue May 29 22:31:53 2001] You are now a wolf.

[Tue May 29 22:34:31 2001] Firiona Vie says, 'Be careful of the brownies'

--We all follow Firiona Vie through the forest of LFay--

[Tue May 29 22:37:17 2001] Firiona Vie approaches her old friend.
[Tue May 29 22:37:21 2001] Firiona Vie says, 'Give her room.'
[Tue May 29 22:37:32 2001] Equestrielle shies away from the gathered crowd.
[Tue May 29 22:37:40 2001] Firiona Vie pets the beautiful beast.
[Tue May 29 22:37:45 2001] Firiona Vie says, 'Hello Equestrielle.'
[Tue May 29 22:37:57 2001] Gewayn tells the group, 'Yep... the Unicorn'
[Tue May 29 22:38:00 2001] Equestrielle says, 'Hello Firiona.'
[Tue May 29 22:38:03 2001] Addar blinks his eyes, cant see anything.
[Tue May 29 22:38:09 2001] Firiona Vie says, 'It has been too long, old friend.'
[Tue May 29 22:38:26 2001] Equestrielle says, 'Yes, it has.'

--Equestrielle appears--

[Tue May 29 22:38:50 2001] Kaedil says, 'Hail Equestrielle'
[Tue May 29 22:38:50 2001] Firiona Vie says, 'I have gathered the stones needed to summon the Mother, dear friend.'

[Tue May 29 22:39:04 2001] Kaeliana says, 'Hail Equestrielle'
[Tue May 29 22:39:37 2001] Mystoran looks at Equestrielle in awe.
[Tue May 29 22:40:06 2001] Elanaia is awestruck.
[Tue May 29 22:40:15 2001] Kaeliana kneels before Equestrielle in humility and reverence.
[Tue May 29 22:40:33 2001] Equestrielle says, 'Due to the corruption of Faydark; Mistmoore, the shadowed men, and the undead, the Faerie ring is the only place that retains enough connections to the Plane of Growth for Tunare to be summoned.'
[Tue May 29 22:41:03 2001] Firiona Vie says, 'Take me there then, Equestrielle.'
[Tue May 29 22:41:03 2001] Equestrielle says, 'I will lead you there my friend.'
[Tue May 29 22:41:04 2001] You tell your party, 'think they will summon Tunare?'
[Tue May 29 22:41:06 2001] Firiona Vie beams a smile at Equestrielle.
[Tue May 29 22:41:07 2001] Kaedil says, 'we will follow you Equestrielle'
[Tue May 29 22:42:55 2001] You say to your guild, 'headed into fairy ring to summon Tunare'
[Tue May 29 22:43:34 2001] Firiona Vie says, 'Young  sprite of the forest, I, Firiona Vie, and this group of Tunare's loyal children humbly ask for your aid in summoning the avatar of our most precious mother.'
[Tue May 29 22:43:34 2001] a faerie guard says 'Grouping with Firiona Vie.'
[Tue May 29 22:43:57 2001] Equestrielle says, 'The ritual must involve the four elements of nature, and the one force that Tunare represents; Life.'
[Tue May 29 22:44:14 2001] a faerie guard says 'Following Master.'
[Tue May 29 22:44:23 2001] Firiona Vie nods at Equestrielle.
[Tue May 29 22:45:00 2001] Equestrielle says, 'You as the champion of Tunare, and as the one moretal being that has the closest connection to the Mother, represent Life and Balance.'
[Tue May 29 22:45:14 2001] Firiona Vie blushes at Equestrielle.
[Tue May 29 22:45:16 2001] Firiona Vie nods at Equestrielle.
[Tue May 29 22:45:45 2001] Equestrielle says, 'My guidance can no longer be of any influence on this path in your Life.'
[Tue May 29 22:46:02 2001] You told Fismabus, 'pos 1038, pos 3617 ...faerie ring'
[Tue May 29 22:46:02 2001] Equestrielle says, 'I will be watching, but it must be from a distance.'
[Tue May 29 22:46:05 2001] Firiona Vie says, 'I understand, glorious beast.'
[Tue May 29 22:46:10 2001] Firiona Vie says, 'I will miss you.'
[Tue May 29 22:46:24 2001] Equestrielle says, 'As I will miss you.'
[Tue May 29 22:46:47 2001] Firiona Vie raises her head knowing what she should do.
[Tue May 29 22:46:55 2001] Reynor shouts, 'goodluck Equestrielle in wherever your travels may take you'
[Tue May 29 22:47:01 2001] Firiona Vie says, 'We must summon the Mother.'
[Tue May 29 22:47:13 2001] Firiona Vie says, 'please back up and give me room.'
[Tue May 29 22:47:13 2001] Gewayn tells the group, 'Wow... it looks like they may be summoning Tunare!'
[Tue May 29 22:47:13 2001] Kaedil says, 'i will help'
[Tue May 29 22:47:14 2001] You say, 'How can we help?'
[Tue May 29 22:47:43 2001] Reynor says, 'How may we be of assistance?'
[Tue May 29 22:47:51 2001] Firiona Vie says, 'I am going to choose four loyal children of Tunare to come and aid me in this.  We will need room.'
[Tue May 29 22:48:02 2001] Arotar says, 'I am at your service Firiona Vie'
[Tue May 29 22:48:14 2001] Addar says, 'Your will is my Honour'
[Tue May 29 22:48:16 2001] Mystoran watches quietly.
[Tue May 29 22:48:22 2001] Tanares kneels in respect for the princess.
[Tue May 29 22:48:26 2001] Kaedil kneels before Firiona Vie in humility and reverence.
[Tue May 29 22:48:33 2001] Amedeus kneels before Firiona Vie in humility and reverence.

--A moment of charged energy through the crowd--

[Tue May 29 22:48:43 2001] Firiona Vie says, 'Kaeliana come forward.'
[Tue May 29 22:49:14 2001] Mystoran looks on in awe.
[Tue May 29 22:49:15 2001] Firiona Vie says, 'I am going to give you a stone Kaeliana it is very important that you do not use it's power until I command you.'
[Tue May 29 22:49:26 2001] Tanares says, 'I had heard the tales, but never thought I would lay eyes upon her...'
[Tue May 29 22:49:38 2001] Kaeliana says, 'I will do as you say'
[Tue May 29 22:50:04 2001] Firiona Vie says, 'Mystoran come forward.'
[Tue May 29 22:50:15 2001] You kneel before Firiona Vie in humility and reverence.
[Tue May 29 22:50:41 2001] You say, 'how may I be of service my princess?'
[Tue May 29 22:50:41 2001] Firiona Vie says, 'tanares come forward.'
[Tue May 29 22:50:57 2001] Tanares says, 'Yes, leige'
[Tue May 29 22:51:03 2001] Firiona Vie says, 'and finally kaedil.'
[Tue May 29 22:51:13 2001] Kaedil bows before Firiona Vie.
[Tue May 29 22:51:15 2001] Firiona Vie says, 'back up my friends.'
[Tue May 29 22:51:15 2001] Tanares gazes at Firiona Vie... never has he beheld such beauty.
[Tue May 29 22:51:23 2001] Gewayn tells the guild, 'WOOT WOOT Mystoran is the chosen of 4!'
[Tue May 29 22:51:23 2001] Firiona Vie says, 'you four.  form a circle around me'
[Tue May 29 22:51:29 2001] Firiona Vie says, 'one of you at my north.'
[Tue May 29 22:51:32 2001] Firiona Vie says, 'one at my east '
[Tue May 29 22:51:34 2001] Kaedil says, 'yes Firiona Vie'
[Tue May 29 22:51:45 2001] Mystoran stands to the south.
[Tue May 29 22:51:45 2001] Firiona Vie says, 'and one at my south and west.'
[Tue May 29 22:51:58 2001] Firiona Vie says, 'all others please stay back.'
[Tue May 29 22:52:53 2001] Firiona Vie says, 'Mystoran you shall represent Fire.'
[Tue May 29 22:53:04 2001] You say, 'I shall with all my honor'
[Tue May 29 22:53:06 2001] You bow before Firiona Vie.
[Tue May 29 22:53:13 2001] Firiona Vie says, 'remember do not use this stone until I point at you!'
[Tue May 29 22:53:23 2001] You say, 'I will do as you command'
[Tue May 29 22:54:11 2001] Firiona Vie says, 'Take this stone that I give..and use it when I point at you.'
[Tue May 29 22:54:19 2001] Mystoran saved.

--My name tag changes to 'Mystoran the Fire Caller' as I am given a stone of fire--

[Tue May 29 22:54:27 2001] Firiona Vie says, 'Tanares, you shall represent air.'
[Tue May 29 22:54:30 2001] Firiona Vie says, 'remember do not use this stone until I point at you!'
[Tue May 29 22:54:42 2001] Tanares says, 'I shall with honor, Lady Vie!'
[Tue May 29 22:55:15 2001] Firiona Vie says, 'Take what I give though you may not see it.'
[Tue May 29 22:55:42 2001] Firiona Vie says, 'Kaedil you will represent the water'
[Tue May 29 22:55:44 2001] Kaedil says, 'As you wish Firiona Vie'
[Tue May 29 22:55:46 2001] You say to your guild, 'woot I get to call fire to summon Tunare!!'
[Tue May 29 22:55:46 2001] Firiona Vie says, 'remember do not use this stone until I point at you!'
[Tue May 29 22:55:48 2001] Tanares observes the strange stone... it appears from the wind itself!
[Tue May 29 22:56:05 2001] Tanares says, 'I shall do as you command'
[Tue May 29 22:56:07 2001] Gewayn tells the guild, 'Mystoran the Fire Caller is her name NOW!'
[Tue May 29 22:56:25 2001] Firiona Vie says, 'and finally Kaeliana you shall represent the earth.'
[Tue May 29 22:56:30 2001] Firiona Vie says, 'remember do not use this stone until I point at you!'
[Tue May 29 22:56:34 2001] Kaeliana says, 'as you wish'
[Tue May 29 22:57:05 2001] Firiona Vie says, 'These stones are powerful and can only be used outside a container.'
[Tue May 29 22:57:26 2001] Firiona Vie says, 'As Equestrielle ahs mentioned, I will represent life.'
[Tue May 29 22:57:34 2001] Firiona Vie says, 'Are we ready, Children of Tunare?'
[Tue May 29 22:57:39 2001] Kaedil says, 'yes Firiona Vie'
[Tue May 29 22:57:44 2001] Tanares says, 'I am ready, leige'
[Tue May 29 22:57:45 2001] You say, 'yes Firiona Vie'
[Tue May 29 22:57:55 2001] Kaeliana says, 'i am ready'
[Tue May 29 22:58:26 2001] Firiona Vie says, 'Tunare, oh Sacred Mother of All, I beg your guidance this day and I seek your council in this realm.'
[Tue May 29 22:59:17 2001] Firiona Vie says, 'Upon the four forces of Nature that will serve  and are served by the precious earth mother, I call forward the Mother of All.'
[Tue May 29 23:00:08 2001] Firiona Vie says, 'With the burning flames of Fire, forever scorching and paving the path for new life to grow in the extinguished, they give way for the Scared Mother's entrance.'
[Tue May 29 23:00:12 2001] Firiona Vie points at Mystoran. Yeah you!

--I activate the stone of fire--

[Tue May 29 23:00:45 2001] Your fist bursts into flame.
[Tue May 29 23:00:47 2001] The soft breeze that danced playfully through the forest quickly grows warm with the brilliant blast of crimson flame that blankets the summoner.
[Tue May 29 23:01:00 2001] You bow before Firiona Vie.
[Tue May 29 23:01:35 2001] Firiona Vie says, 'Upon the forgiving, nurturing waves of Water, that quenches the path and give renewal to the Sacred Mother's arrival.'
[Tue May 29 23:01:41 2001] Firiona Vie points at Kaedil. Yeah you!
[Tue May 29 23:01:42 2001] Kaedil lets loose a mighty yaulp.
[Tue May 29 23:01:53 2001] A soft, glowing radiance fills the forest as small, sparkling beads of water begin to swell upon the blades of grass and the leaves that decorate the forest canopy.
[Tue May 29 23:02:32 2001] Firiona Vie says, 'With the soft, gentle dance of the wind, they give guidance to the Sacred Mother's path.'
[Tue May 29 23:02:38 2001] Firiona Vie points at Tanares. Yeah you!
[Tue May 29 23:02:51 2001] The gentle, lovely harmony of birds begins to sing through the air, carried upon the fragrant wings of a caressing, gentle breeze.
[Tue May 29 23:03:03 2001] Addar notices all of the chosen are woodelves.
[Tue May 29 23:03:41 2001] WIthin the wake of the soft, divine zephyr, the hues of the natural world surrounding the forest become sharper within its wake.
[Tue May 29 23:03:44 2001] You told Gewayn, 'he's right.. we ARE all wood elves.. two male rangers, two female druids'
[Tue May 29 23:04:13 2001] Firiona Vie says, 'With the force of Earth, the entity that gives birth and life to all creation, they pave the path.'
[Tue May 29 23:04:18 2001] Firiona Vie points at Kaeliana. Yeah you!
[Tue May 29 23:04:19 2001] Kaeliana floats into the air.
[Tue May 29 23:04:54 2001] Tanares feels power eminating from nature itself.
[Tue May 29 23:05:23 2001] A soft hum begins to sing from the earth.  As in a dance with the Earth's Song, the flora that decorates the forest begins to sway as their roots exted to tightly embrace the life giving soil.
[Tue May 29 23:06:37 2001] Mystoran watches the elements gather intently.
[Tue May 29 23:06:40 2001] Firiona Vie shouts, "With the force of Life, ushering all things unto creation, they bring forthe the final piece of the great cycle and give birth to Tunare's prescence upon Norrath."
[Tue May 29 23:06:53 2001] Throughout the forest, the essence of life begins to take shape.
[Tue May 29 23:07:47 2001] Flowers, beautiful in their pastel hues, begin to grow from the earth and lovely arms of vine reach up and embrace the countless trees scattered throughout the wood.
[Tue May 29 23:07:50 2001] Firiona Vie lowers her eyes in prayer.
[Tue May 29 23:08:23 2001] Mystoran lowers her eyes in respect.
[Tue May 29 23:08:26 2001] Firiona Vie kneels before Mother of All in humility and reverence.
[Tue May 29 23:08:31 2001] Sceleris kneels before Mother of All in humility and reverence.
[Tue May 29 23:08:37 2001] Kaeliana says, 'Hail Mother of All'
[Tue May 29 23:08:42 2001] Elanaia says, 'Hail Mother of All'
[Tue May 29 23:08:42 2001] Kaedil kneels before Mother of All in humility and reverence.
[Tue May 29 23:08:43 2001] Kaeliana kneels before Mother of All in humility and reverence.
[Tue May 29 23:08:54 2001] Firiona Vie says, 'Thank you gracious Tunare, for blessing us with your prescence here today.'
[Tue May 29 23:09:15 2001] Tanares says, 'The great mother... honor of all honors...'
[Tue May 29 23:09:24 2001] You kneel before Mother of All in humility and reverence.
[Tue May 29 23:09:35 2001] Gewayn kneels before Mother of All in humility and reverence.
[Tue May 29 23:09:42 2001] Firiona Vie says, 'I humbly apologize Mother that I have failed in the task that you have presented me and allowed the Lifeguide to fall into evil's clutches.'
[Tue May 29 23:09:49 2001] Firiona Vie lowers her head.
[Tue May 29 23:10:16 2001] Mother of All says, 'Daughter, all is forgiven.  There is no need for such appologies.'
[Tue May 29 23:10:43 2001] Firiona Vie says, 'I seek your guidance, Mother of All.'
[Tue May 29 23:11:00 2001] Tanares kneels in prayer.
[Tue May 29 23:11:10 2001] Mother of All says, 'Your staff, the Lifeguide, has been corrupted by Cazic Thule himself.'
[Tue May 29 23:11:27 2001] Mother of All says, 'I cannot locate it due to the strength of the corruption.'
[Tue May 29 23:11:37 2001] Mother of All says, 'It has been removed from my power.'
[Tue May 29 23:11:45 2001] Mystoran watches intently listening to the Mother.
[Tue May 29 23:11:50 2001] Firiona Vie nods sadly at Tunare.
[Tue May 29 23:11:58 2001] <SYSTEMWIDE MESSAGE>: Lead-GM-Bordael : in approximately 4 hours, all servers will come down for a scheduled patch. Due to this patch, there is a small chance that corpses might disappear when the servers come back up.
[Tue May 29 23:12:30 2001] Your hand is extinguished.
[Tue May 29 23:12:40 2001] Mother of All says, 'Although I fear the evil circulating in the sacred artifact is in accompaniment with my own powers, creating a perversion of life.'
[Tue May 29 23:12:48 2001] Firiona Vie gasps at Mother of All in astonishment.
[Tue May 29 23:13:29 2001] Mystoran cries in outrage of Cazic Thule's actions!
[Tue May 29 23:13:30 2001] Mother of All says, 'The time has come for you to seek out the Ring of Scale for the second time.'
[Tue May 29 23:13:44 2001] Firiona Vie nods at Mother of All.
[Tue May 29 23:14:14 2001] Mother of All says, 'I promise you that I will not allow the children of the Wurmqueen to steal your memories again or harm you.'
[Tue May 29 23:14:30 2001] Firiona Vie says, 'Thank you, merciful Mother.'
[Tue May 29 23:14:32 2001] You beam a smile at Mother of All.
[Tue May 29 23:14:35 2001] Firiona Vie kneels before Mother of All in humility and reverence.
[Tue May 29 23:14:54 2001] Mother of All says, 'Over the past years, the Ring of Scale have grown more secluded and hostile to those who seek them out.'
[Tue May 29 23:15:21 2001] Mother of All says, 'You will need to prove yourself to one of the Ring's agents for a peaceful encounter.'
[Tue May 29 23:15:47 2001] Firiona Vie is not sure how to do this, but nods at the Mother.
[Tue May 29 23:16:16 2001] Mother of All says, 'I already know of one such agent that has taken an interest, but if the agent is she who will lead you to the Ring of Scale, you will have to seek each other out through fate, not speculation.'
[Tue May 29 23:16:52 2001] Mystoran ponders the Mother's words.
[Tue May 29 23:16:56 2001] Firiona Vie says, 'Thank you, gracious Mother.'
[Tue May 29 23:17:25 2001] Firiona Vie says, 'I shall do as you wish immediately, and Cazic-Thule shall pay for his crimes against balance!!'
[Tue May 29 23:17:29 2001] All the splendid glory of life and nature that fills the forest with Tunare's presence abruptly begins to swell with shrivel beneath the forces of decay and fear erupting throughout the forest.
[Tue May 29 23:17:44 2001] You cheer at Firiona Vie.
[Tue May 29 23:17:51 2001] Mother of All says, 'Quickly Firiona!  You must leave!  There is great danger afoot!'
[Tue May 29 23:18:21 2001] Firiona Vie says, 'No, Tunare, I feel the presence of the Faceless near and I shall confront him to protect the precious life of the forest.'
[Tue May 29 23:18:22 2001] Kaedil says, 'we will protect the mother'
[Tue May 29 23:18:35 2001] Tanares says, 'There is a plot against this sacred ceremony!'
[Tue May 29 23:19:00 2001] The sound of the natural woodland creatures fleeing from the open wood roars through the forest as the stench and force of fear continues to swell within the air.
[Tue May 29 23:19:04 2001] Firiona Vie shouts, "Lord of Fear, you are nothing but a coward and fool to have dared to interfere in the forces of balance.
[Tue May 29 23:20:12 2001] Firiona Vie shouts, "I vow vengence upon you, Cazic-Thule, for all the suffering you have caused to the natural world."
[Tue May 29 23:20:20 2001] Screams from aged and fortified camps of both Fier`Dal and Teir`Dal can be heard briefly then are silenced beneath the shock of terror that bursts through the wood.
[Tue May 29 23:20:56 2001] Mother of All says, 'Be wary, leave the forest for your own safety.'
[Tue May 29 23:21:12 2001] Kaedil arms himself to battle no matter what the cause he will protect his mother.
[Tue May 29 23:21:14 2001] Firiona Vie says, 'I will not run from him precious Mother.'
[Tue May 29 23:21:20 2001] Sceleris says, 'We shall protect you to the last my Goddess.'
[Tue May 29 23:21:51 2001] Mystoran will guard the Mother with her life.
[Tue May 29 23:22:15 2001] Gewayn will lay down his life in service.
[Tue May 29 23:22:20 2001] Mother of All says, 'I fear for the safety of all those here.'
[Tue May 29 23:22:32 2001] Bitter chills of terror sting the air and in a thundering crash, pale sickly green smoke slithers across the twisted branches of trees, enveloping every inch of life within the Faydark forest.
[Tue May 29 23:22:34 2001] Firiona Vie says, 'We shall stand together or fall together, precious mother.'

--Cazic-Thule, The Faceless, arrives at the gathering--

[Tue May 29 23:23:11 2001] Cyrael says, 'Come together all ye fair! We can protect out lands, and our goddess!'
[Tue May 29 23:23:28 2001] Tanares shouts, 'Vile thing! You dare insult us with your presence?!?!?!'
[Tue May 29 23:23:36 2001] Mother of All says, 'Your crimes to whither the balance of Norrath shall not go unpaid.'
[Tue May 29 23:23:36 2001] The Faceless regards you indifferently -- what would you like your tombstone to say?
[Tue May 29 23:24:21 2001] Firiona Vie says, 'Faceless One, I shall not allow you to interfere here today.'
[Tue May 29 23:24:22 2001] Mother of All says, 'It is time that everything you have done in the past will fall to dust, and your place will be torn back to what it should be withing existance.'
[Tue May 29 23:24:42 2001] The Faceless speaks in a low voice so as you feel his words more than hear them.

[Tue May 29 23:25:22 2001] Firiona Vie says, 'I have taken much abuse from you in the past, Faceless One, and I will not allow this to continue.'

[Tue May 29 23:26:39 2001] Tanares says, 'I do not fear you'
[Tue May 29 23:26:52 2001] Again the life that swallows the forest of the Faydark shirlls and trembles in the wake of The Faceless.
[Tue May 29 23:27:19 2001] The Faceless roars in victorious celebration.
[Tue May 29 23:27:31 2001] The Faceless glares down at Tanare.
[Tue May 29 23:27:31 2001] Firiona Vie says, 'Faceless, how dare you touch the avatar of the mother.'

[Tue May 29 23:28:16 2001] Firiona Vie says, 'She is in the very air that surrounds us.'
[Tue May 29 23:28:28 2001] Tannan says, 'tunare is more powerful that you ever will be, faceless one....'
[Tue May 29 23:28:30 2001] Firiona Vie says, 'You have merely sent her avatar back to it's plane.'
[Tue May 29 23:28:35 2001] The Faceless says, 'The air is nothing, as is your goddess.'

[Tue May 29 23:32:28 2001] Firiona Vie shouts, "Faceless One, what you have done will not go without proper judgement.  Your reign of terror and corruption on the natural world is soon to  end."
[Tue May 29 23:32:47 2001] The Faceless says, 'Firiona, you are an unknowing child; as arrogant and foolish as the goddess you champion.  Despite my banishment of Tunare, the life around her still exists, Norrath exists, and more importantly, I exist.  In this short time I have grown more powerful.'
[Tue May 29 23:32:56 2001] The Faceless says, 'And I have you to thank for that.'

[Tue May 29 23:33:37 2001] Your feet leave the ground.
[Tue May 29 23:34:09 2001] Firiona Vie shouts, 'Firiona Vie shouts, "Even my very death will not prevent me from purging this land of your unjust acts, Faceless One.  You have not banished Tunare.  The Mother is eternally strong."'
[Tue May 29 23:34:25 2001] The Faceless says, 'I must take my leave of you, horrid brat.  But I shall first leave you with a gift.'
[Tue May 29 23:34:51 2001] The Faceless grows irritated and reahes out to Equestrielle.
[Tue May 29 23:34:55 2001] Equestrielle seems to be moving against her own will towards The Faceless one.
[Tue May 29 23:35:02 2001] Firiona Vie says, 'STOP!'

[Tue May 29 23:35:48 2001] Firiona Vie says, 'Let her go!'
[Tue May 29 23:35:58 2001] The Faceless succumbs to the enticement of flame.
[Tue May 29 23:36:01 2001] Equestrielle is in great pain.
[Tue May 29 23:36:07 2001] Equestrielle appears terrified.
[Tue May 29 23:36:24 2001] Equestrielle feels a healing touch.
[Tue May 29 23:37:00 2001] Gewayn tells the guild, 'hard to tell... alot of spells .... the Faceless one attacked the Unicorn Equestrial'
[Tue May 29 23:37:06 2001] A piercing bellowing cry echoes through the forest.  All essence and magic that had once enveloped the forest dries and crumples.
