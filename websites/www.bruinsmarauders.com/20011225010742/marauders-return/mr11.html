   <p>Shouts rang out through the forest. Everywhere Askander looked 
      there were dead bodies (or things that used-to-maybe-at-one-time-be 
      bodies). The blood red sky cast an eerie light on the whole scene. 
      Fighting was most furious around the tower. There the frightlings 
      pushed in from one side and and the brownies from the other. 
      Askander gathered energy for another cast at the frightlings 
      that surrounded him as he backed away from the small forms in 
      front of him. As more of of the small beasts fell Askander found 
      himself back to back with a familiar face.</p>
   <p>"There's so many of them, Ask." Bruin said as he chopped 
      another brownie to bits. "You came just in time. We could 
      use your help"</p>
   <p>"Bruin I came looking for you. I need some information."</p>
   <p>Bruin took another swing at the brownie in front of him.
      "Now's not such a good time there Ask!"</p>
   <p>"True enough. Looks like you're getting overwhelmed out here. 
       No shame in calling a retreat. Better than getting everyone 
       killed." Askander replied.</p>
   <p>"Aye, sound the retreat!"</p>
   <p>Shouts went out and those that were left scattered to the 
      winds.</p>
   <p>Branches whipped at his face as Askander ran through the forest. 
      He ran into a cleft in the hill face and, as he rounded a corner, 
      practically bowled over a small form sitting on the ground.</p>
   <p>"Ow you big jerk!" The half-elf looked up and, upon recognizing 
      the figure above her, cast a quick spell on them both hiding them 
      from view.</p>
   <p>"Malaguena!" Askander said "We've been getting killed out there."</p>
   <p>"Indeed. Where's Bruin?"</p>
   <p>"Dunno" said Askanders disembodied voice. "lost him in the escape."</p>
   <p>Bruin, just then, came tearing around the bend. Askander reached 
      out and pulled him down to their hiding spot as Malaguena cast 
      her invisibility spell once again.</p>
   <p>"Anybody else here? Who's left?" Bruin asked after they huddled in.</p>
   <p>"I saw Okeefe, Darrasa, and Cumladarn go down." Askander said 
      somberly. "I'm afraid we'll need a cleric of greater skill than I 
      to bring them back."</p>
   <p>"Ok" Bruin stated resolutely "Stay here I'll be back."</p>
   <p>Bruin quickly enlisted the aid of Elliot, a cleric who happened by.
      After an orderly retreat they were back in the cleft once again...</p>
   <p>"Well that certainly didn't go as well as I would have liked!" Bruin 
      said tiredly as he ate another piece of a meat pie. "I'm surprised 
      the Dark elves that live just south of their didn't decide to help 
      just on principle."</p>
   <p>"Which reminds me why I'm here." Askander said sitting up suddenly. 
      "Bruin, some of the clerics in the temple of Marr have convinced me 
      that something big is going on. He said that the Dark Elves were on 
      the move out in the common lands searching for someone named Lanys. 
      Ring a bell?"</p>
   <p>"She was one of the ones involved at Bloody Kithicor. After that 
      battle though she hadn't been heard from much. Speculation had it 
      she was dead." Bruin sifted through old memories of battles long 
      gone. "She's a dangerous person, Ask. Tell me you're not going 
      after her."</p>
   <p>"Not yet anyhow. I'm not sure how she fits into the larger puzzle. 
      I need to find out some information. You know anybody on the inside 
      who might be able to help?"</p>
   <p>"Maybe but they sure don't hang out around here." Bruin got up, 
      stretched and groaned "Ow! I'm getting too old for this. Mal, 
      you think you can make us a door to the commons?"</p>
   <p>"One shortcut coming up!" Malaguena said as she waved her hands,
      gathering power. A door suddenly opened before them and the three 
      of them stepped through ...</p>
