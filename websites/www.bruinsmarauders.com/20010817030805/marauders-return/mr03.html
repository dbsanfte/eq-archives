   <p>Askander wandered into the sunny glade heading straight for the figure 
      on the stump.</p>
   <p>"They're all waiting for you to lead them" he said hesitantly.</p>
   <p>The man on the stump raised his hand slowly. In the other an orange 
      butterfly sat resting it's wings.</p>
   <p>"There's not much time. An evil comes this way the likes of which 
       we've never seen before. The armies of darkness are uniting to stamp 
       out the light. Your leadership is needed" Askander said, a note of 
       impatience creeping into his voice.</p>
   <p>The weathered figure moved slightly and the butterfly took to the wing 
      "The world has no need of me. My followers have gone their seperate ways. 
      They have forgotten me." He said quietly.</p>
   <p>"Not all." Askander replied. "There are some who remember the old ways 
       and wish to return to them. They look to you to rise up and lead them 
       to greatness once more. This is your chance to once again be a force 
       for good. Don't let your burdens overcome you. There is still much work 
       to do."</p>
   <p>"You have sought me out the world over. Is there that great of a need?"</p>
   <p>"Though it has been said before the words have never been more true than 
       they are right now: This is our darkest hour! Come with me your sword 
       and wisdom are desperately needed."</p>
   <p>The figure laughted cruelly. "Old friend you've never had a way with words. 
      But by the tone of your voice I can tell you believe what you say. However 
      how can you be so sure that I can turn the tide?"</p>
   <p>"You alone cannot hope to win the day." Askander looked into the eyes of 
      the stooped figure with a conviction he didn't know he had "But all are 
      needed. Everyone, from the greatest Vicar to the lowliest Ranger after 
      his first day of initiation into the jagged pine, is needed to stem this 
      tide of darkness. But in order to win against such chaos there must be voices 
      that strike out in the night to bring order to our ranks. I believe you to be 
      one of those voices. You can make the difference. This ragged band of leftovers, 
      myself included, still believe in you. I know that you at one time, however 
      long ago, believed in yourself. I'm asking you to once again lead your troops 
      into battle and with a bit of luck, and the blessing of the gods that will 
      listen to us, we will win the day."</p>
   <p>"Very well", the figure said with a tired sigh, "What will the others say? 
       Those that I have left behind. Undoubtedly they will feel abandoned"</p>
   <p>"They might, but as I said, all arms are needed and the heat of battle 
       makes strange allies. Many an old transgression can be undone by the 
       deeds of the present. Keep your eyes on the destination, not those 
       things that would make you stumble and keep you from the prize. Our 
       world as we know it lies on the brink. Come old friend we shall endure 
       these times and make the world a better place for those that come behind."</p>
   <p>As the two strode silently from the glade an orange butterfly disappeared 
      in a flash of light ... </p>
