   <p>Balamorm and Aloynia were resting and recouping by the lakeshore in the commons. 
      The fight with some particularly nasty undead in befallen had left them both 
      battleworn. So they were particularly enjoying the peace and quiet of the 
      afternoon.</p>
   <p>"Hail and well met, fellow marauders!", came a cry from behind them.</p>
   <p>Balamorm turned to see Darrasa, one of the smaller members of their motley band
      approaching.</p>
   <p>"M'lady." Balamorm said bowing low. "How is one of the finer halflings in all 
      of norrath doing today?"</p>
   <p>Darrasa blushed. "Balamorm you old flirt! I'm glad I found you. A trader over 
      by the tunnel said I might find you two here. I need your help."</p>
   <p>"We'd love to help." Aloynia said "What're you after?"</p>
   <p>"Well Rangorn, Gaikutsu, and I were over hunting in the feerott when we ran 
      into a nasty lizard hunting party" Darrasa began. "Rangorn and I slayed a 
      bunch of them but I'm afraid that there were too many. I was knocked unconcious 
      in the fray and fell back into some bushes. When I came to there were no bodies 
      to be found and both Rangorn and Gaikutsu were gone. I think the lizards 
      captured them."</p>
   <p>Balamorm lept to his feet exclaiming, "Well let's go get them!"</p>
   <p>Aloynia looked at her husband with a cloy smile "Dear, if the three of them 
      couldn't fend off a roving band of lizards, what makes you think the three 
      of us will be able to penetrate the temple?"</p>
   <p>Balamorm stopped for a second then lowered his sword dejectedly. "You're right. 
      But what do we do? The marauders are spread out all over the lands right now 
      gathering information."</p>
   <p>"I heard somebody mention in the pub the other day that some mercenaries I 
      know of were in the area lately. Why don't we go see if we can enlist some 
      aid." Aloynia said getting up.</p>
   <p>"And just how do you know a group of mercenaries?" Balamorm said arching an 
      eyebrow.</p>
   <p>"Well dear, I haven't spent my entire life with you now have I?" Aloynia 
      smiled as the walked on down the road ... </p>
