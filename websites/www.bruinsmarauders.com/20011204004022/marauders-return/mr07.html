   <p>Bertoxulous was merciless...</p>
   <p>And so too was the plague (attibuted to him) ravishing the Karanas 
      plains. Askander knew soon after entering them that there would be 
      trouble. However he had no idea of the scope of it. Now lying on 
      the ground, feverish and barely conscious, his only thoughts were 
      of how foolish he'd been to run head first into territory claimed
      by the enemy without a plan. Aloynia spoke to him through a haze, 
      but her words made no sense.</p>
   <p>"I've found a Wizard to take us out of here." Aloynia said trying 
      to pierce the fog in Askander's mind.</p>
   <p>The blue robed wizard stepped up next to her, placing a hand on 
      her shoulder. "It's no use and the longer we stay the worse it will 
      become. We must move quickly."</p>
   <p>"You're right Cumladarn. Let's go."</p>
   <p>With a flash of light the trio blinked out of the nightmare of hate 
      and poison.</p>

   <p>Askander opened his eyes and immediately regretted it. With a groan 
      he rolled over. Or at least attempted to his body managed not more 
      than a twitch or two.</p>
   <p>"Careful" said a voice "You're still weak"</p>
   <p>Askander braved another peek from underneath heavy eyelids. "Am 
      I alive?" he croaked.</p>
   <p>"Barely." said the voice " The northerner got you here in the nick 
      of time. You were barely alive and it took all the priests of Marr 
      to bring you back from the brink. Rodcet must surely smile upon you."</p>
   <p>Askander smiled at the mention of Aloynia. "Where is she?"</p>
   <p>"Gone I'm afraid. After you stabalized, she said she could wait no 
      longer to find her husband. She left in quite a hurry, I might add."</p>
   <p>"I've got to go after her." Askander said as he tried to push himself 
      up off the cot. However he failed miserably and colapsed in a heap of 
      body parts and blankets.</p>
   <p>"I think you'll be going nowhere for a while, friend. Your companion 
      seems strong. Have faith that she will be ok. It is you I'm worried 
      about. This plague has left a taint in you that I cannot begin to 
      guess about the implications of."</p>
   <p>Askander finally looked at the voice directly. The cleric was a man 
      old and stooped.</p>
   <p>"My name is Justineous." he said guessing at Askander's thinking.</p>
   <p>Askander was about to ask another question when the strain of exertion 
      caught up to him and darkness enfolded him. The last thing he heard 
      was Justineous saying "Rest. We have alot of work to do, you and I."</p>
