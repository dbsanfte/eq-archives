   <p>The goblin pulled back as Balamorm took, what he was sure to be, 
      his last breath. Suddenly an explosion at the rim of the pit rained 
      down dirt on him. When Bal opened his eyes again and looked up the 
      goblins were nowhere to be seen. A voice spoke at him from above.</p>
   <p>"You're not a lion."</p>
   <p>A hand reached down and pulled him out of the pit by the collar 
      of his breastplate. Balamorm squinted in the mid afternoon sun 
      as a rather large troll came into focus.</p>
   <p>"Right. This is about on par with my luck lately."</p>
   <p>The troll looked at him questioningly.</p>
   <p>"Look," Balamorm said "if you're going to kill me can you do it 
      quickly? I'm kinda in alot of pain here and don't really have 
      the patience to deal with this anymore."</p>
   <p>"Why would I kill you?" the troll opened his mouth to say something 
      else then seemed to think better of it. They stared at each other 
      for a few seconds before the troll said matter of factly "I think 
      we got off on the wrong foot. My name is Kuraz, and I will be your 
      rescuer today."</p>
   <p>"Uh huh", Bal said not believing this was happening to him "You know 
      you're not like most of the trolls I've ever met. Of course most of 
      the trolls I've met want to tie me down on a spit and roast me alive."</p>
   <p>"That's disgusting. Look I'm not like those trolls cause I'm not 
      those trolls. I was actually raised by some really nice farmers in 
      the plains here. After I got a little to big for them to handle 
      they turned me loose on the world. I've found that hunting around 
      here is kinda fun and spend my days wandering the plains helping 
      out where I can and generally living off the lands."</p>
   <p>"Fair enough I suppose." Bal said. "Look you mind helping me up to 
      the keep in the pass? I'm a little banged up."</p>
   <p>"No can do. The goblins have the pass all up in arms and the guards 
      aren't too fond of me. But you can stay at my place, I'll bandage 
      you up and you'll be feeling better in no time."</p>
   <p>"So coincidentally what was that explosion I heard earlier?" Bal 
      said as he and Kuraz slowly wended their way down the path.</p>
   <p>"Gnomish fireworks"</p>
   <p>"I've never seen fireworks that worked quite like that." Bal 
      said skeptically</p>
   <p>"Well this gnome I ran into said they were a little strong 
      and prone to go off at odd times. I use them mostly for fishing 
      but they come in handy at other times too." Kuraz said grinning 
      from ear to ear as the two wound their way down the path and out 
      of sight.</p>
