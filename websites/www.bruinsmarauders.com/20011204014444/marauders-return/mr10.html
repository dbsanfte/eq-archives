  <p>Aloynia sat on a bench tugging at a loose thread in her tunic. 
     She had asked everyone she knew in the Keep and after that had 
     searched the pass. She had become lost herself at one point and 
     set upon but a group of raiding gnolls but was saved by a band 
     of adventurers and pointed in the right direction back to the 
     Keep. No one had seen him and she feared the worst. Despair had 
     set in and she had no idea where to go. Always before she had 
     been so sure of her direction in life. She'd grown so close to 
     Balamorm she couldn't imagine life without him.</p>
  <p>"See I told you refilling our supply packs before continuing on 
     would be a good idea", said a gravelly voice off to her right.</p>
  <p>As Aloynia began to look up a familiar voice said "So my love, 
     have I kept you waiting?"</p>
  <p>She rushed to Balamorm's arms. "I thought I'd never see you again!"</p>
  <p>"Why?!? Did something happen to your eyes?" Balamorm joked.</p>
  <p>Aloynia stepped back and, to the surprise of all, punched 
     Balamorm in the jaw.</p>
  <p>"OW!" he exclaimed.</p>
  <p>"That's for making me think you were dead!"</p>
  <p>Kuraz chuckled "Well Bal, when you said she was fiery, I 
     had no idea."</p>
  <p>Aloynia turned a stern look on him that was so venomous that 
     Kuraz decided "silence was indeed golden."</p>
  <p>"Look honey, I wanted to come with Askander and Bruin but, 
     when they ambushed us, I decided that I could provide a 
     good distraction and at least let some of us escape alive." 
     Balamorm said appologetically.</p>
  <p>"Hmphf. Next time let the scrawny human provide the distraction. 
     He's got enough scars on him anyway."</p>
  <p>"How is Askander doing anyway? I'm assuming since you're here 
     that they made it safely?"</p>
  <p>"Aye, they did, but Askander and I left immediatly to come rescue 
     you and he fell ill on the journey and I had to enlist magical aid 
     and teleport him to the clerics in Freeport. Now that I've found 
     you we should head back and make sure he's ok."</p>
  <p>"Sounds like a plan. Let's restock our packs and be off." Balamorm 
     said rubbing his hands together.</p>
  <p>"Oh and honey? This time lets wait till daylight to head 
     through Kithicor."</p>
  <p>Balamorm turned to his wife and paled "You didn't?!?"</p>
  <p>"Let's just say the trip here is not one I'd care to repeat." 
      Aloynia replied with a sly smile as they walked into the keep ...</p>
