						<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="white">Well, happy new year, everyone!&nbsp; Semi-large update today...&nbsp; added the message board and the Hall of Shame.&nbsp; However, the Hall of Shame has like...&nbsp; nothing in it, but we are sure it will quickly be filled up.&nbsp; We have a lot of past experiences as a guild that are enough to fill in the Hall of Shame rather well - we just need to find the screenshots we took of those stupid people!&nbsp; Also, for the VERY FEW people that have submitted their self portraits, their pictures have been linked to their names.&nbsp; Also, just a few minor roster updates and changes...&nbsp; nothing major.&nbsp; And last but not least, we are working on figuring out just what new pictures we want to add to the screenshots page, and then the page should be rather caught up in terms of everything.&nbsp; See you all later!</font></p>
