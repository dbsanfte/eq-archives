						<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="white">As well as the simple act of kindness and companionship we choose to follow, we also have certain guidelines that the guild abides by in order for everyone to be as informed as the next person, and for the kindness and companionship to be sincere.&nbsp; We don't want our guild to look bad in any way, shape, or form to the rest of Norrath, and we want people to see &quot;Bruins Marauders&quot; and think &quot;Wow, I've heard that is a good guild!&quot;&nbsp; The Charter is as follows:</font></p>

The Dean of Recruits needs sufficient time to evaluate potential candidates to insure their goals are in alignment with ours, this can be done by grouping or durring an interview as deemed appropriate by the officer. However, when we do find someone with the same goals as us, we do not hesitate to bring them into the guild. All new recruits are on a 30-day trial period for the benefit of both parties.</font></td>

						<p>That is the extent of our guild charter, and it is quite easy to abide by. Although we may seem stiff on the rules and regulations, it is all for the good, and if you are planning on joining, you will see that. Members are encouraged to report offenders to the first available officer. Officers are then to report this to the High Lord.</p>
						<p>If you wish to ask any questions, please feel free to send an e-mail to Bruin at <a href="mailto:Bruinbearheart@hotmail.com">Bruinbearheart@hotmail.com</a>, and your question will be addressed.</p>
						<p>If you wish to fill out the questionnaire for possible induction into the guild, please go to the &quot;Joining the Guild&quot; section.</p>
						<p>We hope to see you soon!</p>
