   <p>The small fire crackled loudly but did little to warm the bodies
      and spirits of those gathered around it.</p>
   <p>"Late as usual." said a tall rugged figure as he clenched his mace 
      in frustration. "Probably lying dead in a snow drift, the victim of 
       a gnoll ambush. I should have gone with him."</p>
   <p>"Wamor, he's wandered this world for some time. Give Askander a little 
      credit" said a distinctly female voice. "Besides Balamorm's with him 
      and if I know my husband they're late cause there was an emergency at 
      the local tavern!"</p>
   <p>"Ah yes Aloynia" said the bard, Valtar "Your hubby is known for his love 
      of good spirits. And has been known to turn the head of pretty barmaid 
      or two"</p>
   <p>Aloynia turned on the bard, staff in hand "My husband is true to me 
      half-elf. Watch your tongue or I'll pull it from your mouth and watch 
      it for you!"</p>
   <p>"Settle you two" Gaikutsu said interposing himself between them. "There 
      is no honor to be gained in this pointless bickering. Besides it's too 
      cold for such antics."</p>
   <p>Sethatign shifted uncomfortably. "This is a far cry from our glory days." 
      Picking up a stick he poked at the small fire sending embers leaping 
      into the air. "Our strength has waned"</p>
   <p>A small dark figure sat down next to him. "Worry not Seth. Konatsu will 
      always be around to aid you. What more strength do you need than my dark 
      powers?"</p>
   <p>As Sethatign turned to stick out his tounge at the Dark elf a figure 
      stepped into the light and all turned to face it.</p>
   <p>"Askander!" Wamor growled "Bout time you got back here, but where is he?"</p>
   <p>Askander turned as another figure walked into the circle. "Bruin!" many 
      exclaimed as the small crowd gathered around the Ranger. There were 
      handshakes and slaps on the back and many a greeting.</p>
   <p>Bruin called for order. "Friends dark times lie ahead. And while I hid 
      from them you have shown to me that hiding is not an option. With the 
      estrangement of my wife and the loss of hope I thought to hide in the 
      forests of Faydwer and lose myself to the world and it's goings on. 
      However that is not to be. We must gather the loyal to us once again 
      and call into account the forces that would despoil our lands. We will 
      once again ride for and let evil know that the Maruaders will not stand 
      idly by while our homes are burned and our loved ones killed."</p>
   <p>Bruin's speech went on to cheers and rallying cries. However two 
      sets of ears were intent on another conversation.</p>
   <p>"Askander, where's my husband?" Aloynia said pensively.</p>
   <p>"Caught in the passes up in the old kingdom of HighHold. The pickclaw 
       clan of goblins are becoming restless up there. We thought to have a 
       peek at their goings on and were ambushed. Your husband is the reason 
       we are here safely. He stood alone against the goblin tide."</p>
   <p>"But where is he? Are you saying he's dead?" Aloynia furrowed her brow 
       in a menacing look that Askander had seen her give her husband many 
       times before.</p>
   <p>"I do not know. Your answers like in the mountain pass. I intend to 
      travel there myself to investigate further. Why don't you accompany 
      me and we can search for the answers to both our questions together."</p>
   <p>"Askander, if you've gotten my husband killed I will never forgive you!"</p>
   <p>Bruin, noticing their hushed conversation broke from the festivities of 
      the small band and approached the pair. "Balamorm eh? Worry not lady 
      your hot headed husband is probably feasing on goblins tonight."</p>
   <p>"I wish I could have your confidance on the matter Bruin.", Aloynia grumbled.</p>
   <p>"Bruin," Askander said "Aloynia and I are going to the pass to seek 
      Balamorm out. We'll meet up with you in the common lands after we 
      finish there. Hopefully we will be able to bring you news of the 
      pickclaws as well as a healthy barbarian warrior."</p>
   <p>"Good. Till we meet again friends." With that Aloynia and Askander set 
      out into the cold ...</p>
