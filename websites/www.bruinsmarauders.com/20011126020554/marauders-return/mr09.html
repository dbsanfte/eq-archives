   <p>Askander had spent the week healing and learning. His first day up 
      and around he noticed that, for a temple, this place was very busy. 
      People coming and going, not one person standing still. Askander pushed 
      Justineous for information but the cleric waved him off with a "Later, 
      you need to rest now". Over the next few days Justineous told Askander 
      how the temple in Freeport had been following the movements of notable 
      figures around the globe.</p>
   <p>"There is a war coming, friend." Justineous said while they were walking 
      the balconies one afternoon "There will be no neutrality in this fight, 
      for the gods of evil come to claim that which they feel is their 
      birthright. We've tried to rally others including those of your hometown. 
      But the followers of Rodcet are busy tending those that have taken ill 
      from the plague and doing what they can to help bolster the dwindling 
      food supply."</p>
   <p>"Surely Rodcet would do something to stop this? I mean truly it is noble 
      to help those in need but if Bertoxxulous means to walk the lands Norrath, 
      surely Rodcet would move to help stop him."</p>
   <p>"Perhaps he has. Askander we could really use your help. The Dark elves 
      are mobilizing in the WC. We can't figure out why. Perhaps some of your 
      connections might be of service?"</p>
   <p>"I don't know anyone who might...", Askander thought for a second, "I 
      remember Bruin once told me of an enchanter he knew who...hmmm I might 
      be able to help. But I've got to find a friend of mine and have no idea 
      where to find him."</p>
   <p>"Actually we might be able to help you with that. Last we heard Bruin 
      and some of the other Marauders were over trying to find a way to stem 
      the tide of undead pixie swarms in Lesser Faydark. We can get somebody 
      to teleport you over there. But hurry we don't know what the children 
      of Innoruuk are up to but I can't imagine it being of benefit to us. 
      Come on we'll get your gear packed up and get you on your way."</p>
