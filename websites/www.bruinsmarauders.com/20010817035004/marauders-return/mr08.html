   <p>Aloynia clung to the side of the mountain with a strength borne 
      of desperation. Below she could hear the bones rattling that 
      signified the undead were out in Kithicor in abundance.</p>
   <p>"Couldn't wait till morning could you, you stupid girl." 
       Aloynia chastized herself. But her recent delay and the thought 
       that her husband might be lying at the bottom of some gorge 
       drove her onward. As she edged along the wall towards Highhold 
       pass she couldn't shake the feeling that Balamorm was in trouble.</p>

   <img src="../divider-480.gif" border="0" alt="">

   <p>"Ok Kuraz we're in trouble." Balamorm said turning to the troll 
      behind him.</p>
   <p>The pair had hidden for a few days while Balamorm tended to his 
      wounds. After that they had headed for highhold but an ambush had 
      got them turned around and (despite Kuraz's claims that he knew 
      where they were going) they had mistakenly found a hidden entrance 
      into Runnyeye, a den filled to the brim with goblins of a very mean 
      persuasion, rather than the keep in Highhold. Balamorm had been 
      through the upper levels a few times but never down below. The 
      problem now lay in the fact that he wasn't sure where they were 
      currently at in the lair, nor how to get to the areas with which 
      he was familiar. To top things off it looked as if a large portion 
      of the Pickclaw clan who had troubled the inhabitants of Highhold 
      for so long had moved in and taken over. There were rotting corpses 
      of goblins and evil eyes everywhere in the dungeon. The two were 
      quietly discussing which way to go when around the corner came a 
      dwarf with an ax over one sholder and a dead goblin over the other. 
      Hoping that perhaps he might know the way out, Balamorm quickly 
      moved to intercept the dwarf.</p>
   <p>"Greetings and well met, stout dwarf" was all Balamorm managed 
      before the dwarf threw the goblin corpse at him.</p>
   <p>Completely taken off guard by this, Balamorm and the lump of 
      flesh and stench rolled to the ground in a confusing flailing 
      tangle of arms and legs. As he finally managed to cast off the 
      dead goblin, the dwarf took a flying leap and landed on Balamorm's 
      chest forcing the air from his lungs.</p>
   <p>Holding a dagger to the large barbarian's throat, the dwarf spoked 
      in hushed tones "Are ya trying to me killed? Ya daft northerner! 
      I swear yer kind are so tall that the thin air up there must rot 
      yer brains! Good thing that Kraked can think quickly before you 
      brought all them gobbies down on us both!"</p>
   <p>Kraked was suddenly lifted from Balamorms' chest. "Now, now small 
      one." whispered Kuraz "I'd greatly appreciate it if you'd leave my 
      friends throat all in one piece. He's bled enough, lately."</p>
   <p>As Kuraz set Kraked back on the ground Balamorm stood and dusted 
      himself off. "Look, we were just wondering if you could show us 
      the way out. We got turned around in here and need to find our 
      way out so I can get back to Halas to meet up with my friends."</p>
   <p>Kraked went picked up his ax then came back and stared up at 
      Balamorm with a furrowed brow. "And what's in it for me? eh? A 
      thank you very kindly, I'd be supposin."</p>
   <p>Balamorm reached into his belt pouch. "I can't believe I still 
      have these after all the fights I've been in and the spills I've 
      taken lately but how about these as a payment." In Balamorm's 
       hands glinted a small pile bloodstones. "I got these fighting 
       elementals on an island just off of Odus. Perhaps these will 
       convince you to help us?"</p>
   <p>Kraked looked at the stones then furrowed his brow at Balamorm 
      for a few seconds. Finally, with a sigh and a shake of his 
      bearded head Kraked turned and said "Follow me, I'll take ya as 
      far as the gorge. After that yer on yer own!"</p>
   <p>As the three made their way down the passage yellow green eyes 
      started intently after them from the nearby darkness ...</p>
