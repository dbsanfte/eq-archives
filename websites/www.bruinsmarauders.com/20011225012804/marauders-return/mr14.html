   <p>Bruin holed up in Kelethin and sent Askander to set up shop in Qeynos and 
      had runners going back and forth collecting data spying on enemy camps and 
      doing their best to discover what evil was afoot.</p>
   <p>A portal quietly shimmered in front of Bruin.</p>
   <p>"Looks like Lord Bayle is finally rallying the troops. Well sort of. What 
      we have is an "official" investigation." Askander said from the other side 
      of the portal. "Local news has it that they are getting ready to round up 
      some suspects. We'll see. Oh, also, Sethatign just got back. Seems the plague 
      is increasing in intensity. Looks like the crops are going to be ruined this 
      year. We could be dealing with a fairly nasty famine this winter. The clerics 
      in the temple of Nife are doing everything they can to try and get some supplies 
      from freeport in here by boat but a couple of the local merchants think they're 
      going to be stopped by the winter storms off the southern tip. Any help you got 
      would be appreciated. This place is total chaos!"</p>
   <p>"Slow down, Ask. Take a breath!" Bruin smiled warmly into the energy vortex "I 
      sent you there to help shore up the chaos but it's not all on you. Remember 
      that there are tons of people working toward the same ends. Do what you can 
      but remember the bigger picture. If Bertie makes it to this realm a little 
      famine will be the least of our worries."</p>
   <p>"Well I'll do what I can. Talk to you in a week." With that the portal closed.</p>
   <p>Rangorn stepped quietly into the room as Bruin pondered the latest news that 
      came to him and shuffled through the stack of papers and maps that laid before him.</p>
   <p>"Bruin," Rangorn said sheepishly, "I have news for you."</p>
   <p>"Well you look unusually downcast young one" Bruin said "What is so grave to 
      wipe the ever present smile from your face?"</p>
   <p>"Well it appears Lanys has the second piece to the staff she's seeking"</p>
   <p>"Was your contact able to give you any more information on what the staff 
      was capable of?" Bruin said hopefully.</p>
   <p>"No, this staff is shrouded in enigma" Rangorn said looking even more sullen.</p>
   <p>"Well" Bruin said standing up "We'll have to do our best to make sure she 
      doesn't get it. C'mon let's go have a pint at the tavern. Looks like we could 
      both use it."</p>
   <p>As they shut the door to the office a figure came out of the shadows in the 
      corner of the office. It looked briefly over the notes but took instead a gem 
      that lay on a table in the far corner.</p>
