   <p>As the last goblin fell to the ground lifeless, Balamorm took stock 
      of his surroundings. High Hold Pass rang cold this time of year reminding 
      him of the distant plains of Everfrost his native home. Unfortunatly this 
      was no Everfrost and his enemies were numerous. This thought brought him 
      back to the present and the danger at hand. He had narrowly escaped the 
      original trap in the pass and his heroics had given Bruin and Askander 
      time to escape. However the tide of goblins was too great and he had been 
      certain that death had finally caught up to him. Then a group of wandering 
      townsfolk from highkeep had wandered by and been drawn into the conflict. 
      Seeing, though, that the small force from the keep was not sufficient to 
      defeat the little green menace and having already sustained many injuries, 
      Balamorm used the insuing chaos to hide himself in a crevice in the canyon 
      wall promptly falling into unconciousness.</p>
   <p>Sometime later he awoke and stumbled out of his hiding place. The next 
      few days were spent fighting, running, bandaging, and hiding. Now Balamorm 
      was tiring. The fighting was wearing him down and to top it off somewhere 
      along the way he had become lost. Sighing Balamorm continued down the path 
      he had chosen yesterday leading down (hopefully onto the vast karanas 
      plains).</p>
   <p>Rounding a bend Balamorm came upon a small rabbit caught in the trap. 
      The animal was dead, but only recently and Bal quickly made the decision 
      that the furrier would not miss one rabbit. However, as he tugged the 
      animal out of the trap he heard a large <i>sproing!</i> as he was 
      uncerimoniously dumped into a small pit. The pit was not deep but the 
      fall had broken a leg. As Balamorm tried to stand and reach the ledge a 
      pair of heads (topped with pointed ears) peeked over the ledge. As he 
      reached for something to throw at the pair he was broght short by a 
      bow pointed straight at him. Resigned to his fate Balamorm watched as 
      the Goblin slowly drew back his bow ...</p>
