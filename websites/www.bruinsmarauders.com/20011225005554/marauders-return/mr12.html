   <p>Nektulos forest coalesced into being all around the trio. As 
      Bruin, Askander, and Malaguena took stock of their surrondings 
      a lithe Dark Elf stepped out of the shadows beside Bruin.</p>
   <p>"Bruin look out!" Malaguena shouted, gathering her arcane 
      energies to assault the stranger.</p>
   <p>"No wait!" Askander grabbed Malaguena's wrists "OW! Son of a..."</p>
   <p>Askander quickly let go of her arms and fell to his knees 
      smoke rising from his palms. Malaguena reached down and grabbed 
      Askander by the hair, pulling him to eye level with her.</p>
   <p>"Never touch me while I'm casting..." she said menacingly.</p>
   <p>"Umm guys?" Bruin said quietly. "Could we maybe argue some other time?"</p>
   <p>Askander and Maleguena turned to look at Bruin who was now 
      held by the Dark Elf who had a knife to his throat. A small 
      line of crimson slowly made it's way down his neck.</p>
   <p>"Both of you step back and don't make any sudden moves!" The 
      dark lady's look spoke volumes about how serious she was. "Bruin, 
      sweetheart, I could have sworn I told you never to come here. 
      Did I confuse you with my big words?"</p>
   <p>Askander stepped forward palms out "Ma'am I'm sure we can work 
      this out. If you'll just let him"</p>
   <p>"Child, if you value your life, I'd stay right there and not move 
      a muscle." she said menacingly.</p>
   <p>"Konatsu, look, we're in a hurry and we need some answers. Answers 
      that only you can get!" Bruin said.</p>
   <p>"Well, I'm glad you appreciate some of my finer skills, Bruin. 
      What is it you are after?" She relaxed the knife ever so slightly.</p>
   <p>"We need to know why Lanys keeps popping up all over the globe. 
      And if the rumors are true that your king seeks her head even 
      now." Askander explained.</p>
   <p>Konatsu pondered this for a moment then tightened the blade back 
      up to Bruin's neck. "So what's in this for me? Why should I help you??"</p>
   <p>"I have one thing you want Konatsu. A piece of information that 
      seems to lead to a blade called the Ragebringer. I know you have 
      been seeking legends and lore about it." Bruin said.</p>
   <p>"And how do I know you're telling the truth?" Konatsu said skeptically.</p>
   <p>"I have never lied to you yet. And I vow I never will. But we need 
      this information. Can you help us?" Bruin pleaded.</p>
   <p>Konatsu thought for a moment more then finally said "Very well I 
      will help you." and then took the dagger from his throat and 
      pushed him forward into the dirt.</p>
   <p>When the three looked up she was gone. But a voice echoed out 
      from the forest "When I have information to impart I will come 
      find you. But never return here or I will make sure you are never 
      found again."</p>
   <p>With that statement the trio was left to themselves to make their 
      way out of the forest ...</p>
