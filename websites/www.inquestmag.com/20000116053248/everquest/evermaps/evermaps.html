                  struggling to make that next experience level?
                  Instead, take our guided tour of the Norrath's
                  three major continents: Antonica, Odus and Feydwer.

                  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana" COLOR="#003333"><B>ANTONICA</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana"><B><BR>
                  </B>Antonica is the motherland of Norrath, the
                  largest of its five continents and home to its two
                  largest cities&emdash;Qeynos and Freeport. The land
                  is defined by its diversity; the terrain ranges
                  from arctic wastes to scorching sands, while the
                  civilized races consist of diminutive halflings to
                  towering ogres and everything in
                  between.</FONT></P>
                  
                  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The continent is
                  essentially divided into two halves, separated by
                  the Highpass Mountains. Qeynos, Everfrost and the
                  Karanas dominate the north/western half, while the
                  south/east is comprised primarily of Freeport, the
                  Commonlands and the desert Ro. Traveling
                  cross-continent is not a trip to be taken lightly;
                  it is a long and dangerous journey&emdash;you may
                  run into a 40th-level cyclops&emdash;and the trip
                  should not be attempted until you have some
                  experience under your belt.</FONT></P>
                  
                  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Meanwhile, there
                  are many places to explore in Antonica on both
                  sides of the continent, but be wary of the
                  wildlife. Hill giants and griffons&emdash;both of
                  which can pound you for as much as 100 damage per
                  shot&emdash;roam the vast countryside of Karana and
                  the Commonlands, the continent's two largest open
                  areas. Meanwhile, those traveling in the desert of
                  Ro would be wise to avoid contact with the
                  30th-level sand giants and aptly-named
                  terrorantulas which can slay a 15th-level warrior
                  with just one poisonous sting.</FONT></P>
                  
                  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana"><B>Easy
                  Experience: </B>Once you've outgrown the easiest
                  areas in the west, the hills of Qeynos and the open
                  tundra area of Everfrost are good spots to find
                  wildlife suitable for hunting, ranging from
                  7th-level snow leopards to 13th-level mammoth
                  calves. Good prey, including giant bats and a
                  variety of lions, can also be found in the Karanas,
                  though you are advised to stay close to the guard
                  towers and keep a careful vigil for wandering hill
                  giants.</FONT></P>
                  
                  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Across the
                  continent, the ever-green glade of Misty
                  Thicket&emdash;located next to the halfling village
                  of Rivervale&emdash;is an excellent area for
                  improving your skills, all the way up to 13th or
                  14th level. A good-aligned adventurer who starts
                  his career in Freeport may want to consider making
                  the trip to Rivervale and finding a skilled
                  spellcaster to make the peaceful town his permanent
                  residence. Once you hit the teens, try skinning the
                  gators in the Oasis of Marr for some of the fastest
                  experience anywhere.</FONT></P>
                  
                  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana"><B>Fast Cash:</B>
                  If you start your adventuring career in the West,
                  no area is more lucrative than the snowy lands of
                  Everfrost; just about everything you kill carries
                  cash and/or sellable items. As you increase to
                  about 6th level or higher, look to gnoll-infested
                  dungeons like Blackburrow and Splitpaw. As your
                  levels work up to double digits, you will benefit
                  from stalking bandit and gypsy camps in the
                  Karanas. In the east, the money will start to flow
                  once you can take on orc and bandit camps in the
                  Commonlands, as well as the dervish camps in Ro.
                  With a good group, you can start tackling these

                  </B>Ah, peace and quiet. If you're looking for a
                  lot of space and ample low-level monsters to
                  harass, the least-traveled continent in Norrath,
                  the western-most Odus, is the place to be.
                  Currently only two zones outside the starting city
                  of Erudin are supported, Toxxulia Forest and Kerra
                  Isle, and the Forest gets really, really dark after
                  8 p.m. so bring your infravision.</FONT></P>
                  
                  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana"><B>Easy
                  Experience: </B>Newbies should stay close to the
                  Erudin entrance and try their hands at kobold
                  runts, moss snakes and decaying skeletons. Don't
                  make the mistake of attacking an innocent-looking
                  pixie&emdash;you'll be roasted faster than a turkey
                  in November. Once you've advanced to 4th level or
                  so, cross the silver bridge and head to the south
                  of Toxxulia Forest. There you can battle kobolds at
                  various camps and slug it out with the deadlier
                  6th-level skeletons. For 8th or higher level
                  parties, head out to Kerra Isle and pound kerran
                  males and females, while avoiding the
                  ultra-dangerous kerran high guard.</FONT></P>

                  Go for the kobolds! If you're just starting out,
                  hunt down kobold runts; once you tackle 3rd level,
                  you can try your hand at the more advanced kobold
                  watchers and the like. On average, these furry
                  werewolf-looking guys ring up one or two silver
                  each time, and occasionally you'll get lucky and
                  score a large bag or belt pouch. Don't sell these!
                  It's usually better to keep storage items to
                  increase your holding space. What else is lucrative
                  prey? Third level or higher characters can go after
                  Fire Beetles&emdash;their eyes provide a light
                  source in the dark forest and can be sold for two
                  or more silver apiece. Finally, unless you're a
                  necromancer and want the bone chips, avoid
                  skeletons&emdash;they give you zippo in the coin
                  department.</FONT></P>

                  To the east of Antonica, across the Ocean of Tears,
                  lies the continent of Feydwer. This enchanted place
                  is home to many of Norrath's
                  wee-folk&emdash;dwarves, elves and gnomes, as well
                  as pixies, faeries and the ill-tempered
                  brownies.</FONT></P>
                  
                  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">However, Feydwer
                  is also home to some of the lands most terrifying
                  locales. The underwater city of Kedge is located
                  beneath the waves of Dagnor's Cauldron, while just
                  beyond Lesser Faydark lies Mistmoore Keep, home to
                  a 53rd-level vampire.</FONT></P>

                  Experience:</B> If it's experience you're looking
                  for, Butcherblock is your best bet. There is a
                  large variety of wildlife, and guards are located
                  throughout the zone that can protect you if a fight
                  goes awry. Find your way to a three-way fork known
                  by the locals as "The Crossroads," set up camp and
                  you're golden. At higher levels, the Chessboard
                  with its undead pawns, knights and bishops is
                  excellent for experience, but miserable for
                  cash.</FONT></P>

                  If you're looking for easy money in Feydwer, try
                  the various orc, goblin and bandit camps in Faydark
                  and Butcherblock. You'll need a decent-sized group
                  to handle these camps, since targeting one monster
                  in the group usually brings them all running your
                  way. At higher levels, one of the best cash-spots
                  is Butcherblock's Orc Oracle camp, around the
                  mountain and not far from the Chessboard. The
                  bandit camps in Lesser Faydark are also lucrative,
                  though the surroundings are more dangerous.
