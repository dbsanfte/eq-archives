<a name="Introduction"/>
<H1>Update 11/26/01</H1>
<P>So, I came out of retirement and lead another raid.  Finally got to kill that damn Hand that had eluded me so far.
<P>I have updated the sections regarding camping the Spiroc Lord and strategy involved to kill the hand of Veeshan.  My previous zergling strategy for the Hand wasn't very good. :)  Also, a good many spelling errors, grammar errors, and confusing points have been eliminated.
<H1>Introduction</H1>
<cite>"It is easy to go down into Hell; night and day, the gates of dark Death 
stand wide; but to climb back again, to retrace one's steps to the upper air - 
there's the rub, the task."<BR>-- Virgil, <I>Aeneid</I> </cite>
<P>I'm a level 59 druid, recently retired. I began attempting sky trips starting 
around October 2000. I'm not from an uber guild. My raids have been open raids 
like you often see in fear and hate, which fail miserably when attacking 
sky.</P>
<P>And in the start, we did fail. I would say that each trip we normally failed 
whichever isle we did for the first time. Normally progressing about one 
additional isle each trip as we gained more levels and sky experience.</P>
<P>One of the most frustrating parts of sky is that screw-ups are raid ending. 
In most situations if you fail, you just drag corpses, res and try again. In 
sky, if you fail, it's not uncommon that you have to pack up and try again next 
month.</P>
<P>This guide is intended to help mitigate some of that pain for the new folks, 
with the average player in the low to mid 50's. The tactics discussed don't 
assume a hoard of level 60's, but they would work well for those folks 
also. :) It contains massive amounts of "spoiler" information - consider 
yourself warned. Sky can be can be a fun zone to learn, but it can also be a very 
harsh and frustrating teacher. I hope my guide makes sky more fun for you.</P>
<P>I've tried to include all pertinent information you need to get to the top 
and kill all possible mobs. However, there is a lot to leading and succeeding in 
sky besides just knowing how to kill things. I've added some leadership 
suggestions, but I recommend nobody attempting to lead sky unless they've had 
significant leadership experience elsewhere.</P>
<P>This guide assumes you have a basic understanding of the mechanics of sky: 
how the keys work, how spawning Sirran works, how to summon people between isle, 
etc. It covers Bzzazzt and higher isles especially well because they normally 
give people the most trouble.</P>
<P>If you have any feedback, corrections, or wish to send me any interesting 
screenshots from sky, you may email me at <A 
href="mailto:adawen@pobox.com">adawen@pobox.com</A></P>
<P>I'd like to thank Pini &lt;Amicus&gt; and Fardok &lt;Talion&gt; for going to 
about all my raids and being my right hand guys. And I'd also like to thank my 
guildmates and friends who kept coming up to help. Since they followed me to 
sky, I'm sure they would have followed me anywhere.</P>
<P>Thanks to Pini again for helping me with this guide. It's a bit more readable 
and correct because of him :)</P>
<P>Good luck to you,</P>Adawen Earthtruth<BR>Guild Amicus<BR>Tunare

<H1>Other Guides</H1>
<P>There are a few other good guides out there. I learned a lot from <A target="_top" href="http://www.thesafehouse.org/pages/resources/shzoneguide.htm#sky">Hottoq's 
guide</A> from the Safehouse. This guide is at least a year or so old, but not 
much has changed. Consult this guide for mob names, levels, and abilities. I try 
not to duplicate too much of this info, but I do try to provide more specific 
resist information. 
<P><A target="_top" href="http://www.geocities.com/lordhong/sky.htm">Catranizi's Plane of Sky 
Guide</A> has a good info on the mobs and drops.</P>
<P>The best quest/item guide that I have seen is <A target="_top" 
href="http://bit.csc.lsu.edu/~raymond/images/Air_Quest_Items.xls">Xekl's 
spreadsheet</A>. You may still be able to view the <A target="_top" 
href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=7969.topic">safehouse 
thread</A>. This is by far the best single listing of quests, rewards, and quest 
item locations.</P>These guides are pretty solid, but be careful when doing 
online research. I've read some guides that have stuff that is flat out wrong. 
Other guides are pre-kunark and not very relevant these days.

<a name="tips"/>
<H1>Tips for Leading Sky</H1>
<P>Have a cleric camped on the first isle at all times to facilitate bringing up 
reinforcements. Ideally this would be somebody on the raid who has access to an 
extra PC and account. 56 res is nicer than 49.</P>
<P>Have a mule at a wiz port (Tox wizard spires was always my meeting place) 
with a few small coffins and several (at least 5) sky stones. This will both 
speed up any bad wipeout, and provide the stone when you need a quick port up of 
reinforcements.</P>
<P>It is generally a good idea to have a cleric camped out at all times in case 
of wipeout.</P>
<P>Necros should have an essence emerald at all times in case of wipeout.</P>
<P>Make sure keys are handled appropriately. Clerics and necros should be first 
priority, with paladins and SKs with summon corpse second. After that, it's who 
needs their mana the most (getting dueled and corpse summoned makes you OOM). I 
general say casters (except wizards) next, then hybrids, then pure melee. Don't 
let keys rot. Melees should learn to keep 3 hour corpses when they die to limit 
the amount of time spent dueling and zoning. </P>
<P>Leading sky is 10x harder than leading fear or hate. I recommend delegating 
as much as you can. One of the key difficulties of sky is bringing up 
reinforcements. Keeping a sustainable force up there is one of the hardest jobs 
for new sky leader and crew. Try to have a plan to be able to bring people up 
without totally shutting down action. It's very easy to get in a vicious cycle 
where people leave because the action is slow, forcing you to stop and bring more people 
up. Which in turn makes more people leave because they are bored.</P>
<P>Know your critical classes and make sure you have them: a couple warriors 
with defensives, mala/malo from a 60 mage/shaman, a couple necros who won't bail 
on you and leave you stranded with no way to bring up reinforcements, a good 
enchanter or two, and lots of good clerics (one res stick is almost a 
necessity). Malo/mala are almost required so I'll mention them again.</P>
<P>Sky is very weird because there are often mobs you don't want to kill, 
because they split into harder mob(s), or may interfere with larger objectives 
like camping the Spiroc Lord. This concept is very alien to a lot of players. So 
a large portion of your time will be spent telling people what you are going to 
kill, and in what order.</P>
<P>I've tried to recommend the strength (in levels) and numbers needed to 
succeed on the various numbers. Keep in mind that one cleric for each group is 
ideal, although I often manage with one or two more groups than clerics. Also, 
melee heavy works much better than caster heavy, although you do need your key 
casters. I know that these isles can be done with less than I recommend; these 
numbers are meant for groups that have little experience in sky.</P>

<a name="loot"/>
<H1>Loot</H1>
<P>Any mob in sky has a chance of dropping loot from the "common" loot table. 
Generally, the higher level the mob is the more likely it is to drop loot. 
Bosses will almost always drop an item from this table, often times 2. I 
recommend checking <A target="_top"  
href="http://www.geocities.com/lordhong/sky.htm#itemsdrop">Catranizi's list</A>. 
It's the same list as this but better.
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>warrior, monk, rogue haste belts (same haste as FBSS with AC and stats) 
  <LI>hybrid and bard haste belts (same haste as swirlspine/hangmans noose with 
  AC and stats) 
  <LI>symbol of marr - AC 15 +5 str/wis pally only neck 
  <LI>whitened treant fist - 14/28 monk 1hb, lighter than knuckleduster 
  <LI>blade of abrogation - SK epic item 
  <LI>weight of the gods (WotG) - nice cleric shoulders AC 12 +5 wis +50 mana 
  +25 magic resistant 
  <LI>treant tear - decent druid earring 
  <LI>shaman stein - suck 
  <LI>each caster has a bracer which is so/so 
  <LI>white satin gloves - all/all AC 4 +25 hp/mana +30 fire, -5 to all other 
  resists (I normally give these to wizards first because their bracer sucks) 
  </LI></UL>
<P>All other items are keys or quest pieces.</P>
<P>Do not confuse the dropped haste belts with the quest haste belts. Quest 
haste belts are extremely rare, and are better than RBB or CoF.</P>
<P>For sky quests, your best bet for info is <A target="_top"  
href="http://bit.csc.lsu.edu/~raymond/images/Air_Quest_Items.xls">Xekl's 
spreadsheet</A>. Class specific websites often have handy information also. <A target="_top" 
href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/misc/skyquests/">EQCastersRealms </A>lists all 
the quests and also has a handy list of all sky quest components with the 
class(es) that need them. Keep in mind that sky quest rewards have been changed 
several times since sky was released.</P>
<P>It's a good idea to have your quest items printed out before you go to sky so 
that you know what pieces you need.</P>
<HR>

<a name="sirran"/>
<H1>Sirran the Lunatic </H1>
<P>Sirran is your friend. Sirran is an asshole. Sirran can make or break your 
raid. Don't spend too much time up in sky, or you'll become crazy like him.</P>
<P>Sirran spawns after killing the isle's boss. He will give you keys pieces for 
the next isle if you give him the item that he wants that dropped on the current 
isle.</P>
<P>There can never be more than one Sirran in sky. For example, if a Sirran is 
spawned on Faerie isle and somebody has been hailing him the whole time and you 
kill the Protector of Sky Azarack boss - game over - no Sirran, no keys for next 
isle. This presents some issues if there are two raids going simultaneously.
<P>
<P>Sirran will assist any sky mob that attacks you.</P>
<P>Sirran double attacks for over 2k.</P>
<P>Hailing Sirran will keep him from despawning if you have linkdead people who 
need keys. But be sure to let him despawn when you're down with him.</P>
<P>Generally talking to Sirran is a bad idea. You can make him kill you or even 
worse make him despawn stranding you.</P>
<P>If you do want to talk to Sirran, I recommend waiting until everybody has 
gotten their keys for the next isle.</P>
<P>Sirran will often spawn 10+ feet above the ground. If he does this, just pick 
an unlucky person to cast a spell on him and he will run down and kill them. 
Perhaps an SK could pull him away and FD. Sometimes it's because the corpse of 
the thing that caused him to spawn is still there. Like on Horses, the Keeper of 
Souls makes Sirran spawn high. Once the corpse is looted and poofs, Sirran falls 
to the ground.

    <TD>
      <P>First of all, if you cast any AE spell including enchanter's AE stun. 
      Don't use AE spells here, and be sure not to cast non-buff spells (nukes, 
      debuffs, stuns) on other PCs. If you do, the quest hall will come kill 
      you, and maybe a good chunk of your fellow raid members. </P>
      <P>Second, if you duel here, you will agro the keymaster and quest room 
      mobs as well.</P>
      <P>Before you start pulling, give the princess a few plat to spawn the 
      necro epic quest mob on Gorg isle, just in case anybody needs him.</P>
      <P>This isle is quite easy. Just fight anywhere near the edge, and pull 
      faeries to there. When pulling stay near the edge, because the princess is 
      in the middle.</P>
      <P>A common mistake is to agro the princess early. If this happens, then 
      you have a problem. You don't won't to kill her unless all the faeries 
      have already been killed. Also, she is difficult to mez with only tash on 
      her. If this happens, you're best off getting somebody to train her around 
      while people camp out.</P>
      <P>Another common problem encountered here or on Noble Dojorn isle is that 
      people port to azarack before the raid is ready and promptly get slain by 
      Azaracks.</P></TD></TR>

    <TD align=right vAlign=top width="25%">Other Notes</TD>
    <TD>
      <P>Keys for both Dojorn and Azarack can be bought for about 400pp and 
      200pp respectively. The key to the quest room is only 1 copper. These are 
      the only keys that can be bought in sky.</P>
      <P>Unlike the rest of the isles, 3 teleport dishes are on this isle. The 
      one to the west teleports to Noble Dojorn isle (not agro) if you use the 
      Key of Swords. The north teleports you to the quest room if you buy a Key 
      of Veeshan from the keymaster. The one to the east teleports you to 
      azaracks (agro)if you use the key of beasts(horn).</P>
      <P>Remember that Azaracks is the one place where you cannot corpse summon 
      people up to (you teleport up into a fight). Make sure the right 24 people 
      get keys to go there, or be prepared to buy them.</P>
      <P>The key to quest room has the same name as the key for the last isle (Key of Veeshan), 
      but they are different.</P>
      <P>Killing the keymaster lowers your sky faction :) Don't recommend doing 
      that.</P>
      <P>Beware of going to the quest room. They only way out is to jump back 
      down to freeport. Or if you have a corpse, you can be ressed above.

    <TD>
      <P>Kill Dojorn (lure only mob). Have warriors tank the two extra 
      bladestorms. Slow bladestorms. Dojorn does an irresistible 200pt AE. 
      Pathing is horrid there, so melee need to try to not push Dojorn around 
      much or he will path to outside the windmill. After Dojorn is dead the 
      bladestorms are pushovers.</P>
      <P>For this to go well, the warrior need to get agro on the extra 
      bladestorm very quickly. Note that sometimes they take a while to come in. 
      Other times they path poorly and will somehow end up on Gorgalusk isle and 
      you won't have to fight one or two of them at all.</P></TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD align=right vAlign=top width="25%">Alternate Strategy #1</TD>
    <TD>
      <P>Since the bladestorms are easier than Dojorn, you can kill them much 
      quicker especially if you are caster heavy. Kill one or 2 bladestorms 
      having a defensive warrior tank dojorn then try to camp out (hard because 
      of AE). 
      <P>You will eventually kill both bladestorms and be able to deal with a 
      solo efreeti. This tactic is more painful than the dojorn first strategy, 
      but may work better for a force that just can't quite kill Dojorn while 
      fighting both bladestorms. </P></TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD align=right vAlign=top width="25%">Alternate Strategy #2</TD>
    <TD>
      <P>Pull bladestorm and efreeti to Gorgalusk isle. This can sometimes be 
      very hard/boring to pull off, but it is possible. Be prepared to be 
      patient to pull this off.</P>
      <P>Start off by pulling the 2 bladestorms to Gorgalusk. A magician using 
      their lowest level bolt spell seems to work best. They stand on the edge 
      closest to Dojorn isle, and try to bolt a Bladestorm as it roams around. 
      The magician should stand still until the bladestorm gets very close. If 
      the magician runs back to group immediately after bolting, the mob might 
      give up on chasing him. Bladestorms seem to always come single this way. A 
      ranger with raincaller may also work.</P>
      <P>Now you're ready for Dojorn. You need to get a Monk over to Gorgalusk 
      Isle. Hopefully you have a monk and a wizard with all 3 keys to go to 
      Dojorn, Azaracks, then back to Gorg. If not, there are other options 
      available that I'll let you figure out. Have the wizard port the monk back 
      to isle one, then come back. You should have a plan in case the monk dies 
      on Dojorn Isle. Also, the monk will lose buffs after ports. Would be nice 
      if you have a cleric there to buff him.</P>
      <P>You now have a monk on Dojorn. The monk aggros him and pulls him to the 
      very edge of the island closest to Gorgalusk isle. You should have a 
      couple rangers waiting with raincallers and their best range arrows. If 
      you're lucky, they'll be able to pull Dojorn over to you.</P>
      <P>Also note, sometimes they get agro and get crazy pathing inside the 
      windmill. If this happens the person who has the agro needs to camp out. 
      </P></TD></TR>

    <TD align=right vAlign=top width="25%">What to do when things go bad</TD>
    <TD>If you don't have a cleric, it's easy to port one up again and buy

  <TR>
    <TD align=right vAlign=top width="25%">Other notes</TD>
    <TD>
      <P>This isle can be and is often skipped. Its difficulty level is 
      approximate to spiroc isle. This is also the isle that you spawn Gwan on 
      for the Monk epic. The essence used to trigger Gwan will respawn 2 hours 
      after doing the quest. Gwan is a cakewalk for any raid that is going to 
      kill Dojorn or Azaracks.</P>
      <P>People are often confused on how you get off this isle. It has a 
      teleport dish to Azarack isle only. On my raids we do Dojorn isle after 
      Faeries but before Azaracks. </P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>

      <P>Everyone insert invis, except primary assist who should be visible. 
      When an azarack attacks, kill it and mez adds. Continue killing. Hopefully 
      you can kill them before you get too many adds. Clerics seem to be 
      especially tasty here and should mem both invulns. Casters can easily nuke 
      them if they are using the right type (cold/fire), and they aren't too bad 
      to slow once they are tashed.</P>
      <P>If the placeholder does attack you (notice the higher damage), you 
      should try to mez it and kill it last. If you do kill it, and the 
      Protector of sky agros on you, you're probably going to be wiped out. If 
      that does happen your best is to train away the Boss from zone and try to 
      do CR super fast. That last 10 times or so that I have done azarack, the 
      PH has stayed in his spot until we ran over to kill him.</P>
      <P>Never ever pull until you're just down to 3 or so Azaracks left. Make 
      sure you don't pull the PH (the one who doesn't roam around). The last few 
      roamer you often have to take the fight to them, as they path poorly.</P>

      <P>The secret to doing this isle well is all in the pulling. You can 
      normally pull your first mob that roams just by casting from the dish. 
      Expand from there pulling the roaming mobs. I try to leave the dispelling 
      eyes till last. Puller needs to be able to cast to pull roamers. If puller 
      grabs too many (I would say no more than 2 mobs until you get a feel), 
      just let him die. The mobs won't attack unless you help. </P>
      <P>After roamers are dead you can pull the front 2 clouds from the front 
      of the building. Then you can FD pull the 2 clouds and eye at the back of 
      the building. This leaves the Boss (Gorgalosk) and the 2 mini-bosses in 
      the building. If you hail the boss after it has flown outside the 
      building, it will stay in place so you can isolate it from the other two. 
      If you get both mini-bosses at once, you can probably train one around 
      while killing one. It's very bad to fight both at once because the eye 
      (Avenging Gazer) will dispell all your buffs.</P>

      <P>Kill that horse. It will be very easy. Immediately upon its death it 
      will spawn 2 level 54 horses at its corpse. Casters should be away and not 
      sitting to avoid getting hit. Nobody should be attacking a horse yet. Have 
      a brave enchanter cast tash on one, pulling it away from group. Assist 
      calls to attack the one that is left.</P>
      <P>A level 60 magician/shaman casts mala/malo on the one the enchanter 
      pulled (see alternate strategies below if you don't have mala/malo). This

      try to debuff the level 54 horse that they are currently fighting.</P>
      <P>When the level 54 horse dies, it will spawn one level 56 horse. This

    <TD>4-5 groups low to mid 50's, the more levels the less painful. If on

  <TR>
    <TD align=right vAlign=top width="25%">Strategy</TD>
    <TD>
      <P>First off, spawns are linked very weirdly here. The lesser spirocs are 
      linked to a vanquisher. One pair per vanquisher. They will respawn unless 
      their associated vanquisher has been killed. The Spiroc Lord will respawn 
      if Spiroc Guardian is still up. The Spiroc Guardian will respawn if <B>any</B> lesser spiroc is alive and <B>NOT AGRO</B>
      <P>So the goal on the pull is to kill the vanquishers first, because they 
      won't repop.</P>
      <P>Where you pull to helps a lot. As mentioned above, I recommend pulling 
      to about 8 o'clock, a small jog CW of port in. This should be on the CCW 
      (port-in side) of the low area at about 9 o'clock.</P>
      <P>I recommend having somebody expendable pull the vanquisher in the house 
      closest to port in - the bird house with the arbiter and banisher running 
      around. A paladin who will hit DA right after he pulls works well. This pull 
      will bring 1-3 vanquishers, 2-6 lesser spirocs, and very likely the spiroc 
      guardian. The assist should pick the first vanquisher he sees and get 
      everybody to kill it. The lesser spirocs are easy for the enchanters to 
      mez. Remember you have no pets because they can play hell with the 
      enchanters trying to mez. Have warriors set up to tank the extra 
      vanquishers and guardian. Get the extra vanquishers and guardians slowed 
      ASAP. Healers who heal early will probably get ganked or need to 
      invuln.</P>
      <P>After the vanquishers are dead, kill the guardian if it came. It will 
      respawn but not reagro on you. Then kill the lesser spirocs in alphabetic 
      order of their name (but do not kill the last one if the Guardian is not up and you want to camp the Lord). If you are fighting at the port in area, then the 
      repopped Guardian will agro on you if you fighting something there. That's 
      why I don't recommend fighting at port in.</P>
      <P>If after killing everything a vanquisher is still up, pull it 
      using same tactics. Sometimes it's tricky to pull without getting DTed. 
      Watch the roaming path and pull when they are farthest from the Lord.</P>
      <P>At this point, you must decide whether you are going to farm the lord. 
      If you are going to farm the lord, go to the next subsection</A>.</P>
      <P>If you don't want to camp the Lord, then you should kill the Guardian before 
      the Lord. To kill the Guardian you should go back and fight at port in. If 
      lesser spirocs are up when you pull the guardian, have a warrior tank the 
      guardian while killing the lesser spirocs. If you kill the Guardian first, 
      he'll just respawn again and agro on you if there is anything out there which remains unpulled.</P></TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD align=right vAlign=top width="25%">Camping the Spiroc Lord</TD>
    <TD>
      <P>First off, only kill the Guardian if you're sure he'll 
      respawn (I.E. there is at least one lesser spirocs still up). If there is no Guardian, and still a lesser spiroc alive, have everyone camp out and clear agro.  When the spiroc loses agro, the Guardian will spawn.  If you killed all the little spirocs, then bye-bye lord camp - no more Guardian - the Lord will not respawn.</P>

      <P>The idea is to kill everything on the isle except the Lord and 
      guardian, then kill Spiroc Lord ad nauseam.</P>
      <P>If all the vanquishers are dead, and a lesser spiroc or two is still 
      up, it's often easiest to just pull the Lord.  I recommend putting a single tank on it, and have all your casters nuke the hell out of it.  Just make sure it dies before the lord.  Alternatively, have a ranger or someone 
      pull the little spirocs that come to help the lord away and mez them. Just 
      be sure that Sirran doesn't spawn near them and you're well away from the Lord. After Lord is dead you can 
      kill them at your leisure. If you do this, be sure to fight a bit more 
      clockwise closer by the lord to ensure that you don't agro the guardian 
      and lord at same time.</P>
      <P>Remember the lord will respawn right away. So you need to pull the Lord 
      away from where he spawns. Remember that Sirran will spawn, and he will 
      assist the next time you try to kill the lord if he's too close. If Sirran 
      is too close to the lord you might have to pull Sirran away, or wait for 
      him to despawn. This becomes a geometry puzzle of where to pull Lord to so 
      you won't agro Sirran, the Guardian, or the Lord right when it repops.

    <TD align=right vAlign=top width="25%">Strategy</TD>
    <TD>
      <P>First off, make sure everybody knows that the Bzzazzt's ARE agro, although you are ok in the safe spot.  Then plan to be trained by somebody whose curiosity gets the best of them.  Let everybody know if you get trained, NOBODY should attack anything, this is a sure plan for a even bigger wipeout.  Anybody who can do non-damage taunt (ranger, druid, sk, etc), should try to taunt one and train it away, enchanters may try to mez, and anybody else should try to camp.  Being trained by the bees sucks bad enough, being unprepared can cause all out disaster.</P>

      <P>Next, get inserted. I recommend a cleric and inviser be the last 
      folks up in case somebody trains and wipeouts. Or get the camped out 
      cleric up and invis early then you'll be safe.</P>
      <P>I will refer to 3 bzzazzt as "left bee", "middle bee", and "right bee". 
      The directions are based as if you were looking from the dish behind the 
      gears.</P>
      <P>Bzzazzt is HARD. For the average EQ player, I don't know quite how to 
      describe it. I would say comparable to Sev in EJ, but easier to screw up. 
      Harder than Lord D in velks. In some ways harder, and in some ways easier 
      than doing HoT in ToV. 30 level 55-60 people will do OK if they know what 
      they're doing. I'd recommend 36+ people if you don't have a few high 
      warriors. Expect as many deaths here as you have had on all the isles 
      before this. Expect a wipeout or 3. Have your CR plan ready. Bzzazzt is 
      HARD.
      <P>
      <P>The 3 level 50 bees are pretty easy. They are mezzable with some effort 
      after tash, easy after malo is on them. They hit for almost 400 damage, but 
      they're only level 50 mobs so they're not that bad. Problem is they split 
      on their death, each in a different way. The middle bee is the one that 
      will eventually split into the boss. I've never been able to single pull 
      them. We always get all of those that are up. So expect to get all 3 when 
      you pull.
      <P>
      <P>Did you hear Bzzazzt was hard? Have your CR plan ready</P>
      <P>There are several ways to approach this. What I recommend is kill left 
      bee and subsequent spawns, then camp out to clear agro. Then kill right 
      bee and splits while keeping middle one mezzed. Then you can keep middle 
      one mezzed until you're ready for the real action. I considers the left 
      bee splits slightly harder than right bee, but the left splits are easier 
      to manage in some ways. Doesn't really matter which you do first.</P>
      <P>If you have balls, there are some other options. Either kill the middle 
      (and boss) first or second, and use one or two charmed bzzazzts as pets. 
      If you don't quite have the strength for the boss, this could save the day 
      (or ruin it). If you have a couple enchanters on the ball supplied with 
      wands of allure (3 charges of level 49 charm, instant cast, drops from 
      Worry Wraiths in Fear), then you may want to try this. If you do this, 
      then you will need to keep Sirran hailed and away from the fights if you 
      want the 16 keys from the 2 remaining Bzzazzt. I have used one bzzazzt pet 
      to kill boss twice. Both times the boss died. Once worked sweet, once the 
      Bzzazzt lost charm at the end and Sirran wiped the whole raid out. We were 
      able to recover from the wipeout just fine though (/cheer camped out invis 
      cleric). I generally don't recommend this approach if you have the 
      manpower to kill him normal.
      <P>
      <P>Did you hear Bzzazzt Isle is hard? Have your CR plan ready.</P>
      <H2>LEFT BEE</H2>
      <P>This one has a split setup very similar to the horses you fought 
      earlier. After you kill it, it splits into 2 level 55 Bazzzazzt's. Nobody 
      should be sitting around the time this splits, or they will ping pong 
      around hitting the sitting people.</P>
      <P>Bazzzazzt are slowable and spells land ok after debuffs. I recommend 
      having a warrior with defensive tank the extra. Shouldn't be too bad if 
      you get it slowed fast. Enchanters can mez these with the level 54 spell 
      Glamour of Kintaz. But that mez will suck their mana fast. If a warrior 
      can get agro fast on the extra you should do well. If you ping pong this 
      around, it might kill several folks before the warrior gets agro.</P>
      <P>After you kill the first level 55 Bazzzazzt it will spawn a level 57 
      Bizazzt. This one hits very hard (~700) and has extremely high resists. 
      Don't expect to get it slowed. This one will enrage. Pet users don't let 
      your pet die to enrage, it still needs to help kill 2 more mean mobs.</P>
      <P>After you kill this, kill the level 55 Bazzzazzt that the warrior has 
      been tanking, and the level 57 Bizazzt that then spawns.</P>
      <P>This is a hard fight, it's not uncommon to be wiped out or lose half 
      your forces on it. If you succeed, then things look good for the final 
      boss fight.</P>
      <P>If you do win the fight, you are now left with 2 mezzed bzzazzt (or if 
      your enchanters all died and you have a couple folks training them around). 
      Don't attack these. You should camp out to clear agro. Because they are 
      both annoying to keep mezzed and you probably don't know which is which 
      now. Leave somebody to train them away after everybody is camped out. They 
      return back to their spawn points once they lose agro and snare wears 
      off.</P>
      <P>If it looks like things are going to fail, train stuff away to the 
      opposite side of the isle. The splits have no home spot and will stay 
      camping the corpse of whomever they killed last.</P>
      <P>The names of the bees can be confusing. A general rule of thumb is to 
      attack whatever is on the top of your tracking list (most recent 
      spawn).</P>
      <P>Did you hear Bzzazzt Isle is hard? Have your CR plan ready.</P>
      <H2>RIGHT BEE (common split - 3 level 55 Bazzzazzt)</H2>
      <P>First off, the right bee has a bit of an identity crisis. It splits two 
      different ways. This way is the common way, the other way is described 
      below.</P>
      <P>When you kill the right Bzzazzt, 3 level 55 Bazzzazzt will spawn. These 
      are the same as the 2 that were part of the left split, but after you kill 
      them, nothing new spawns.</O> 
      <P>Just decide whether you're going to tank the two extra or try to mez 
      one or both them (Glamor of Kintaz). Dictate would probably also work well 
      also. I recommend tanking the extras, because it's easy and will work 
      better if you get the uncommon spawn. You should be able to drop the first 
      one quick with nukage.</P>
      <P>Just remember that you are keeping the middle Bzzazzt mezzed through 
      all of this.</P>
      <P>I consider this easier than the left bee split, but because it is 3 
      mobs initially versus 2 from the left split, and the possibility of the 
      alternate split (below), I recommend doing the left bee split first.</P>
      <P>If you killed the left bee before this, then you are down to just the 
      middle Bzzazzt left. You can keep it mezzed until you are ready to kill 
      it. Laugh at your enchanter when tash and malosini wear off and they are 
      unable to mez it, but do not kill it.</P>
      <H2>RIGHT BEE (uncommon split - 2 (Bzizzzt?) that hit for 1000+ but low 
      hp)</H2>
      <P>I've only see this once out of a half dozen or so Bzzazzt clearings. 
      Frankly, I don't recall what these are called. But if you only see 2 new 
      spawns on track, and your tanks are dying fast, this is probably why.</P>
      <P>These hit very hard but have very low hp. What you have to be worried 
      about is your assist dying (2 mobs doubling for 1k can do that quick), and 
      all your tanks sitting around banging their assist key to no avail. If you 
      get this split, I recommend just shouting "Attack %t NUKE HARD, attack %t" 
      As long as they're not attacking mezzed Bzzazzt, you should do OK.</P>
      <P>Did you hear Bzzazzt Isle is hard? Have your CR plan ready.</P>
      <H2>MIDDLE BEE (yes this is the boss eventually)</H2>The spawn setup for 
      the middle bee is: 
      <UL>
        <LI>start with 50 Bzzazzt 
        <LI>then level 55 Bazzzazzt 
        <LI>then level 60 Bzzt 
        <LI>then Bazzt Zzzt (boss) </LI></UL>
      <P>The good thing is you never fight more than one at a time in this 
      fight. The bad news is that Bzzt is tougher than any of the previous 
      bosses, and Bazzt Zzzt the boss is rougher.</P>
      <P>The queen bitch Bazzt Zzzt does a large area effect disease spell 
      (soandso's flesh begins to rot), so have your disease gear and buffs up 
      when you're going to fight her. Resist disease 120+ should be OK. This is 
      the disease same spell as Fear's old Dracoliche before they buffed him and 
      Cazic into Velious class mobs. This spell isn't a major part of the fight, 
      but it will kill pets and stick on low level folks without resist 
gear.</P>
      <P>For this fight, I recommend fighting in the middle of the isle, on the 
      other side of the gears. The reason for this is that you have to have a 
      VERY strong group to kill all 4 successive spawns in one fell swoop. This 
      way if you do camp out, the dish area will be clear for CR.</P>
      <P>The Bzzt before the boss is very tough. It's very easy to lose tanks to 
      this mob because it hits so hard. After killing him, if you didn't lose 
      very many tanks, and your clerics still have their mana, go ahead and kill 
      the boss. Ideally you want to get this guy agro on your best warrior and 
      have him go defensive disc.</P>
      <P>For most new crews though, once you spawn Bazzt Zzzt, I recommend 
      camping out. Drag and res the dead, and attack the boss fresh. Remember 
      that after you spawn the boss, it will despawn in ~70 minutes. Remind 
      everybody to save disciplines for this fight. I recommend people have 
      their riposte/dodge disciplines ready, so that melee damage will not kill 
      them. It is possible to kill all 4 spawn one long fight, but I 
      recommend waiting until you've done it once the cautious way to get a feel 
      for the difficulty. Remember that you need disease resist in addition or 
      poison for the Boss.</P>
      <P>After you kill Bazzt Zzzt boss, Sirran will spawn. It's VERY important 
      if you want to kill the Eye and Hand of Veeshan to spawn the sister of the 
      spire.</P>
      <P>Did you hear Bzzazzt Isle is hard? Have your CR plan ready.</P>
      <H2>Narris (Sirran), sister of the spire, and farming keys for last 
      isle.</H2>
      <P>After killing the Bazzt bitch boss. Sirran will spawn speaking 
      backwards. This version of Sirran is there to spawn the sister of the 
      spire (the boss of the next isle). Without spawning the sister, you will 
      be stuck on drake isle and unable to proceed to the next isle.</P>
      <P>To spawn the sister, you must tell Sirran "llaw eht htiw eno ma I" 
      which is "I am one with the wall" backwards. Other similar phrases also 
      work.</P>
      <P>Drake isle normally just provides around 24 keys to the final isle of 
      Veeshan. But, the sister drops 2 key pieces each time. You can trigger the 
      sister as many times as you want, and get keys for everybody in your 
      raid.</P>
      <P>To do this, one person must remain behind on Bzzazzt isle when 
      everybody else goes up to drake isle. They need to "/say citanul eht 
      narris liah" (Hail Sirran the Lunatic, backwards) every minute or so to 
      keep him from despawning. If you say the correct phrase he will reply back 
      something backwards.</P>
      <P>After the raid on drake isle kills the sister, the person entertaining 
      Sirran should immediately tell him "llaw eht htiw eno ma I" to spawn a new 
      sister. You may be tempted to not have the sister up for a while for 
      various reasons. However, I suggest ALWAYS spawn the sister IMMEDIATELY 
      after a sister is killed. The reason for this is if Sirran by some chance 
      despawns (person with him went LD, fell asleep, etc), and no Sister is up. 
      Then you are stuck on drake isle and unable to proceed to kill the Eye and 
      Hand of Veeshan. If Sirran despawns and the Sister is up, you will still 
      be able to get quite a few keys and hopefully will have enough people to 
      kill the eye and the hand.</P>
      <P>When you are ready to stop farming the sister, you should spawn the 
      last Sister, but do not kill it until Sirran on Bzzazzt to despawns. After he has despawned you can kill the Sister which cause Sirran to spawn on Drake 
      isle and you will be able to get your keys to Veeshan Isle.</P>
      <P>I have never seen the Sister despawn, and have seen her up for at least 
      24 hours.</P></TD></TR>

    <TD>You have the cleric camped invis right? I sure hope so. If splits are 
      camping the dish, you can probably go to one side or another and be able

      <P>A case can be made for rushing the bees instead of pulling them to the 
      dish. This will keep the dish area clear for CR. Whatever you do, be sure 
      that you have planned for CR.</P>
      <P>There is normally some very hairy action on this isle, which can make 
      keys rot. Remember each Bzzazzt drops 8 dull dragon scales for keys and

    <TD>
      <P>Congratulations, the worse of sky is now behind you, and you have a 
      nice coast to the top ahead of you. Don't get too complacent though. You 
      can still get wiped out here, but it shouldn't be too hard to avoid and CR 
      is easy.</P>
      <P>First off, two areas of this isle are agro with DTing mobs. Inside the 
      building the Sister of the Spire has a small agro radius. If you get near 
      the dish, near the last isle where the hand and eye of Veeshan are, then 
      the Hand will DT you. The rest of the isle is not agro though.</P>
      <P>I've always fought in the low area near the edge a bit CCW of where you 
      port in. No good reason for this, but it works. Don't fight too close to 
      the edge, because you can be gravity fluxed off by the drakes.</P>
      <P>Start by pulling the roaming drakes. The only drakes that you will be 
      able to cast on are the black ones (Heartsbane Drakes), all the rest are 
      lure only, or nearly lure only. Drakes are not mezzable.</P>
      <P>Pathing is horrid, expect a few large pulls at the start. Beware of bad 
      pathers agroing a hoard and coming in when you don't expect. As a general 
      rule of thumb, let the puller die if they get more than 4 or 5. Assign a 
      few tanks to tank/kite extras. If the puller watches the pattern well, he 
      should do OK. The puller needs to baby them in. I recommend paladin or SK 
      for puller. The last couple drakes will be pretty hard to pull. Use Pini's 
      enchanter trick and bindsight it in order to keep an eye for when it gets 
      close to the isle, and then tash to pull it in.</P>
      <P>After all the easily pullable drakes are dead, move up closer to the 
      building. Close to it, but well out of assist range of the closest Sphinx. 
      Sphinxes are easy to pull solo. Just have somebody take the DT and have a 
      warrior pull. Be sure to dispel them since they are enchanters. If you can 
      have the person taking the DT agro with dispel, that would be wonderful. 
      Should only get about 2 deaths per Sphinx, the initial DT and one second 
      DT. These have manageable resists, can be slowed and nuked. When pulling 
      the ones near building stay on the far edge so that you don't agro the 
      sister. If you have trouble pulling the ones towards the back, just wait 
      until you're done camping the sister to kill them.</P>
      <P>Now I recommend camping the Sister until you have keys pieces for 
      everyone. Kill her in the same spot you pulled the Sphinxes to, at the 
      bottom of the ramp. Have paladins or necros invuln pull after someone 
      takes the initial DT. She has an irresistible AE for 1000 damage, but 
      doesn't hit very hard. Should be very easy to kill with just 3 or so 
      deathtouches. Each time she will drop 2 replicas for keys. In additions 
      she will drop a nice rare quest item, and 2 "common" loot items. So in 
      addition to camping for keys she's nice to camp for loot.</P>
      <P>After everybody has a Wurm Replica, get everyone keys by letting the 
      Sirran despawn on Bzzazzt, killing sister, then getting your keys. Take a 
      break and let Sirran despawn. You'll want the whole island clear to kill 
      the spirits.</P>
      <P>After Sirran has despawned, it's time to kill the undine spirits (clean 
      up any Sphinxes you left first). Move everybody to one side of the island. 
      Assign a couple people to train spirits, and somebody to pull off of them. 
      I compare this pull strategy to the Fear temple pull. You'll want a lot of 
      free room to train them around well out of CH range of the rest of the 
      group fighting.</P>
      <P>Pullers/trainers need sow and high MR. They are clerics and dispell on 
      occasion so keep that in mind (hide sow and MR at the bottom of list). 
      They aren't too hard to mez. Just remember to nuke/stun at end so they 
      don't CH. The wisps live in the attic of the building, and are a bit hard 
      to see.</P>
      <P>VERY IMPORTANT - dead wisps look just like live wisps. Be sure to loot 
      all the corpse. As everybody should have turned in their replicas for 
      keys earlier, so you don't need to save these, can just loot and destroy 
      replicas to clean up the corpse.</P>
      <P>Spirits really aren't that hard as long as you have an enchanter on the 
      ball. It's pretty easy to handle 3 or 4 at once, just all 8 can get nasty 
      with them CHing each other.</P>
      <P>Nothing should be left on this isle now.</P></TD></TR>

      <P>In my experience this isle normally drops 1-3 crowns of elemental 
      mastery for the mage epic. They can drop off any of the mobs on this isle. 
      This is random though, and I have heard of none dropping. For a small 
      sample of 3 trips, I have seen 2 drop once, 3 drop once, and 2 drop on

      <P>If the hand is not up, it easy, just go up, and kill the eye whenever you are ready.</P>

      <P>The eye is a pushover, comparable to the sister. 
      <P>The hand double for 865, procs a 500 dd, and AEs for 200 - one mean bastard.  Both are lure only of course.</P>


      <P>I am 99% sure the Hand of Veeshan will DT you anywhere on this isle. 
      Thus there are no safe spots to summon to if the Hand is up</P>
      <P>Before you go up, might not hurt for a necro to have a 3 hour corpse on 
      Drakes in case of total wipeout. Thus the cleric on Drake 
      isle could res him up to there. But you'd still have to port everybody 
      back to sky to summon corpses.</P>

      <P>The idea here is that everybody has keys, invises, and goes up together all at once to the far end of the isle behind the windmill.  If you are the back end of the isle, you can attack the Hand without agroing the eye.  If you do somehow agro the eye, as long as you kill the hand, the camped out 
      cleric with key on drakes can come up and res you all, because the eye is       not agro.</P>

      <P>For your first time, I recommend giving all players rune V before going.  It is a small cost considering how expensive a wipeout is.  Melee should use their appropriate discipline on the eye - something to do extra damage or riposte/dodge disciplines should be ready if the plan on agroing.</P>
      <P>The hand is VERY mean.  Significantly more so than the queen bee.  You have been warned.</P>

    <TD align=right vAlign=top width="25%">What to do when things go bad</TD>
    <TD>
      <P>If you kill the hand, the camped out cleric (who got a key right?) can 
      come up safely and res everybody and you can kill the eye of veeshan at 
      your leisure.</P>
      <P>If you get wiped out and failed to kill hand, you're in a world of 
      hurt. You're going to have to port everyone back up to sky. You then have 
      to decide if you're going to give up on the raid, or summon corpse to 
      drake isle and try again. Either way everybody is going to have to have 
      their corpse summoned. You're going to need to think about this hard - 
      it's going to be a bitch to get everybody into the summon group. You would 
      probably form a group for summon link by summoning somebody's corpse who 
      has all the keys back to the first isle. Have them invis back up to drake 
      isle, invite necro, and pivot group leadership back to somebody on isle 
      one. See the appendixes about Summoning Reinforcements and Recovering From

<H1>APPENDIX </H1>
<HR>

<a name="summon"/>
<H1>Summoning up Reinforcements </H1>
<P>This strategy has worked on all islands up to and including Drake isle. Also, 
let's you know what to expect if you're a reinforcement coming up to sky. Necros 
and classes with bindsight should pay especially good attention to this.</P>
<H2>Pivot Technique </H2>
<P>First off, let me describe what I call <I>Pivoting</I>. This is the term I 
use for changing the group leader of the group. It's very simple, but people 
often don't understand what or why it's going on.</P>
<P>You have a group of 3 people. Anybody besides the 3 core people might as well 
disband. The 3 people are: 
<OL>
  <LI>Group leader. Must be able to invite the other 2 members 
  <LI>Pivot target (normally person on lower isle) 
  <LI>Necro (at the island you wish to summon people to </LI></OL>
<P></P>
<P>The group leader may start at lower island and use keys/res to go higher. Or 
this may be someone who bindsighted to invite somebody on isle 1 as discussed 
later. This person will invite somebody at the lower level, then he will invite 
a necro at the higher level. The "pivot target" then targets the necro using one 
of the function keys F2-F6. In a 3 person group this will probably be F3. The 
"pivot target" must keep the necro targeted while the group leader disbands the 
group. After the group disbands, the pivot target invites the necro, and anybody 
else on the lower isle who needs their corpse summoned.</P>
<P>Also note that the necro should keep the "pivot target" targeted in case 
something goes wrong. He can invite the pivot target into a group and they can 
repeat the process.</P>
<H2>The basic way to bring up reinforcements </H2>
<P>The basic way that people bring up reinforcements is: 
<OL>
  <LI>Wizard dies to produce 3 hour corpse 
  <LI>Wizard gets ressed. Get stone for port. Invites a necro. Jumps off. 
  <LI>Wizard ports 1-4 people up to sky. The new people suicide on isle one, get 
  ressed, get summoned by necro. 
  <LI>Wizard is ressed back up to his corpse. </LI></OL>
<P></P>
<P>This has a few disadvantages. The wizard might have to suicide, the wizard 
may poof keys jumping out of sky, and you can only bring up 4 people at a 
time.</P>
<P>However, the advantage of this method is it is very reliable. The method 
takes a bit of practice to be able to implements</P>
<H2>Fancy Reinforcements </H2>
<P>With this method, any random wizard in Gfay can port up the new people, and 
no one has to die (except the people being summoned). 
<OL>
  <LI>Somebody up in sky bindsights the keymaster on isle one. Either by casting 
  eye of zomm spell and running it down there, or chain bindsighting if enough 
  mobs are up and you're patient (a la Pini). If you're on gorgalusk, you can 
  probably just target the keymaster directly. I have seen an enchanter 
  bindsight the keymaster from every isle (when at the upper isles the lower 
  isles were respawned to provide bindsight targets). 
  <LI>Due to how EQ treats the Z-axis, you will not be able to see any PCs on 
  isle one, even when they are there. Have one or 2 of the new arrivals camp 
  right in front of the keymaster then come right back. When they log back on, 
  the game will treat them as NPCs for a short period of time and you will be 
  able to target them and invite them to your group. 
  <LI>Invite a necro (you could have done this earlier) 
  <LI><I>Pivot</I> group leadership to the person on the ground. 
  <LI>People on the first isle attack keymaster and die. Get ressed, get corpse 
  summoned, get revived. Bonus points if you kill the keymaster before he kills 
  you. ;) </LI></OL>
<P>Voila, you were able to port up a full group of 6 new arrivals with no 3 hour 
experience corpses of people already up top. Your wizard didn't have to get a 
3hr corpse and worry about losing their keys if they jumped.</P>
<H2>Homework</H2>
<P>Your really have to think about this a bit before it make sense and you don't 
do anything stupid. So here's a quick homework question. Combine the basic and 
fancy methods to solve this.</P>
<P>You have a wizard with a 3 hour corpse on Spirocs. You have 5 people waiting 
in Tox to come up. How does this wizard bring all 5 people with one sky 
stone?</P>
<HR>

<a name="melee"/>
<H1>Tips for melee </H1>
<P>ASSIST</P>
<P>We normally have a bit of trouble with melee pushing stuff around, especially 
pushing stuff towards the isle edges - NOT GOOD. You should know by now that all 
melee attacks (including all classes and pets) push mobs a slight amount each 
hit. So generally the mob will move in the direction that the majority of the 
melee are facing. For this reason, my second prime directive to melee is "ALWAYS 
FIGHT WITH YOUR BACKS TO EDGE" i.e. pushing mobs away from the edge. This is 
second only to assisting. Of course, getting too far away from the edge can also 
be a bad thing, but generally this rule holds true.</O> 
<P>ASSIST</P>
<P>Be ready for enrage. All mobs 56+ enrage in sky. This includes all bosses, a 
few roaming mobs on Gorgs, the 3rd version of the horse split, Spiroc 
Vanquishers and Guardian, most of the high level bees, and all drakes on drake 
isle. I have seen raids fail when enrage killed most of the remaining tanks.</P>
<P>ASSIST</P>
<P>Generally be smart. Know what stuff you should be attacking. Also, just 
because somebody is hitting on a mob, doesn't mean you should be too - it might 
be the warrior tanking an extra that you don't want to kill. Listen for the 
assist. Know when it's safe to attack/taunt that mob attacking your cleric, and 
when you shouldn't because the enchanter is trying to mez it. This isn't 
fear/hate where you just sit and hit assist all day, it requires more 
tactics.</P>
<P>Oh yeah, remember to ASSIST</P>
<HR>

<a name="camping"/>
<H1>Camping Out</H1>
<P>You're going to camp out eventually, make sure your raid knows when it's a 
possibility and how to handle it.</P>
<P>There are lots of ways to do camp outs. Lots of ways will work, just make 
sure your raid knows what you're doing. Nothing sucks worse than a small stream 
of people coming back in to be killed, keeping the mobs there.</P>
<P>First, make sure your monks, necros, and SKs know that when camp out is 
called, they should feign death instead. Once it's clear for everybody to come 
back, they should /quit out to be safe. Sometimes a FD necro with an essence 
emerald can make a painful CR easy.</P>
<P>I do what I call the AFK method campout. This means that everybody logs a 
secondary, and gives me a tell occasionally. I will set my AFK message 
accordingly. Hopefully I have invised before I camped out so I can come back in 
and scout to give the all clear. If I die, then I will depend on the monks or 
necros to scout. If none of the monks or necros FD, then I will tell a 
non-essential class to come back and check. Once it's clear I set my AFK message 
accordingly.</P>
<P>If train away on campout is needed, make sure people know to do it. This 
especially important on splits that camp your corpses on Horses and Bzzazzt 
isles.</P>
<P>A typical problem is after you camp out, the mobs will camp the scene, 
especially if they were snared. You'll need one of your scouts to train them 
away. They should be prepared to die, but if they're sharp they might be able to 
make it. I saw one necro (Junobil) pull two bzzazzt away from the dish, FD, then 
pop up and use his Circlet of Shadow to insta-invis himself and walk back to the 
group.</P>
<P>Once again, just make sure your raid is informed of your method before the 
situation arises. Trying to educated people while everybody is dying doesn't 
work that well.</P>
<HR>

<a name="recovery"/>
<H1>Recovering from Total Wipeout</H1>
<P>It happens sometimes: everybody that can res is dead. You either don't have a 
camped out cleric, or he died somehow. Luckily, you should be able to get a 
cleric back up there in 30 minutes or less. The key is being prepared and 
knowing what to do. This can be the difference turning a 1 hour+ CR down to just 15 
minutes. One useful note is that I have <I>never</I> witnessed any mob in sky see 
through invis. </P>
<P>First off, you need to locate a sky stone, and a few small coffins. You put 
these on a mule, right?</P>
<P>Second, put together your emergency CR group. This should be: 
<UL>
  <LI>Wizard to port 
  <LI>Cleric who has a complete set of keys to your current isle on their 
  corpse, res stick preferred. Tell him to make sure both his invulns are 
  memmed. 
  <LI>Cleric who has a complete set of keys to your current isle on their corpse 
  (backup in case first one has a problem). Tell him to make sure both his 
  invulns are memmed. 
  <LI>Spirit of Wolf dispensing class 
  <LI>Enchanter for clarity and invis 
  <LI>Necro to do summons. </LI></UL>
<P></P>
<P>This group ports up. The necro should summon the first cleric (if all goes 
well this is the only summon that you do). The cleric should be sure to loot all 
the keys, but should leave an item on his corpse. Ideally he'll wait for res 
until after CR is well under way up at the island you died (by summoning the 
corpse up to there). This will get your CR going that much faster.</P>
<P>Quickly buff the cleric up with hp buffs, clarity and sow. A rune from the 
enchanter won't hurt either. The cleric then prepares to run the gauntlet back 
your isle. When he is ready invis him. The three islands that are agro are 
Azaracks, Spiroc, and Bzzazzt. Before going to Azarack, he should have his key 
to get him to the next isle ready (ditto for Spirocs). Nothing sucks worse than 
trying to find your key with several azaracks beating on you. Invuln + sow 
should work ok on azaracks if invis goes.</P>
<P>Hopefully your cleric makes it up and starts ressings folks. If he fails then 
you can start with the backup cleric, or res the first cleric's corpse which is 
still sitting on the first isle.</P>
<P>Also, beware when going through Spiroc Isle that if invis fails, 
you'll get DTed by the lord. I recommend the clerics have a few invis potions in 
case their invis wears off partway up.</P>
<P>If you are well organized for this, your raiders won't even realize you 
didn't have a cleric camped out. If you are not prepared for this, then it can 
take a long time to do CR and people will get frustrated and leave your 
raid.</P>
<HR>

<a name="classspecific"/>
<H1>class specific advice</H1>
<P>Standard raid practices normally apply in sky. Here is some sky specific 
advice, and a bit of emphasis on standard raid advice. 
<H2>Druid</H2>
<UL>
  <LI>keep improved camo memmed, before any campout, try to invis first so that 
  you can come back quick as a scout 
  <LI>don't forget to use ro's fiery sundering and fixation of ro, good debuffs 
  (one druid should be assigned to each) 
  <LI>assist heal </LI></UL>
<H2>Shaman</H2>
<UL>
  <LI>standard raid procedures, buff and slow. Malosini if able 
  <LI>not much to do on boss fights except heal </LI></UL>
<H2>Cleric</H2>
<UL>
  <LI>keep both invulns memmed, especially on azarack's, spiroc, and bzzazzt 
  <LI>assist heals will save the day. 
  <LI>remember group heals on AE mobs 
  <LI>bind at meeting place (tox spires?) in case of wipeout 
  <LI>Bring a few invis potions, for CRs and campouts </LI></UL>
<H2>Enchanter (from Pini)</H2>
<UL>
  <LI>Keep everyone hasted. With stacking problems with Shissar worked out, 
  everyone should have it whether they are asking for it or not. Especially on 
  bosses. 
  <LI>Crowd Control by Isle 
  <OL>
    <LI>Thunder Spirits can be dazzled on bad pulls. Boss can be dazzled also 
    after debuffs. 
    <LI>Azaracks is all about crowd control. Dazzle works fine, but I'd 
    recommend tash'ing first 
    <LI>Taj has some things that need kintaz. Gusts and Clouds are ok to mez 
    even without tash. The spirited harpies, eyes, and gorgolasks can require 
    kintaz if they are high enough level. If your puller is good, you may not 
    need to mez anything at all when all singles come dribbling in. 
    <LI>The horse split can be dazzled. More than likely, it isn't worth it if 
    you don't have Malo/Mala though. (<I>Adawen's note: This is from Pini's 
    perspective at 56, without the level 57 tash spell. I believe a 60 enchanter 
    will be able to keep one mezzed with some work.</I>) 
    <LI>Spirocs is all about crowd control also. Vanqishers can be raptured. The 
    little spirocs can be dazzled. I'd recommend tash first. 
    <LI>The only things worth mezzing here are the three original bees. They are 
    50 and can be mezzed easily once mala/malo and tash are on. 
    <LI>The only thing that can be mezzed are the Undine Spirits. They can be 
    dazzled easily. </LI></OL>
  <LI>For bosses, it's good to have Rune up. You never know when you might save 
  the day by filling in gaps between real heals. 
  <LI>Use your pet when it's going to help even though you hate it. Bosses that AE 
  will agro your pet and it'll get in some hits before it dies. /cheer for it 
  while it lives. 
  <LI>Getting everything slowed is a big key to making sky go well. Make sure 
  everything is tashed, and remember your slow is pretty good - help the shaman 
  out if you're not doing CC. (Adawen) </LI></UL>
<H2>Magician</H2>
<UL>
  <LI>mala if able, malosini everything 
  <LI>watch enrage and your pet. Especially on multi-mob enrage fight fights 
  where you will kill several mobs in a row that will enrage like in bzzazzt and 
  drake isle. No use for your pet to die needlessly. 
  <LI>Only level 49+ air pets and epic pets are summonable in sky. </LI></UL>
<H2>Necro</H2>
<UL>
  <LI>The basics of course: keep clerics and shaman with mana, summon lots of 
  corpses 
  <LI>Be sure to feign death if things start to look bad. A FD necro can save a 
  lot of time from CR from a wipeout. Make sure you have an essence emerald for 
  this. 
  <LI>bind at meeting place (tox spires?) in case of wipeout 
  <LI>watch enrage and your pet. Especially on multi-mob enrage fight fights 
  where you will kill several mobs in a row that will enrage like in bzzazzt and 
  drake isle. No use for your pet to die needlessly. 
  <LI>Use root to help in crowd control intensive situations (azarack, spiroc, 
  bzzazzt). </LI></UL>
<H2>Wizard</H2>
<UL>
  <LI>ALWAYS leave something on your corpse if you die to prevent you from 
  having to suicide later to bring folks. 
  <LI>Similarly, you should never loot a key unless it is going to rot have one. 
  When the leader says "Casters loot keys", he doesn't mean you. The reason is 
  you may have to jump off to bring people up and lose your key. 
  <LI>Understand how the mechanics of bringing up reinforcements work. Think 
  about this some. 
  <LI>On bosses make sure and save a couple lures for when enrage hits. I've 
  seen raids get a boss to enrage, then fail after all their melee die to enrage 
  and wizard's oom. 
  <LI>Use root to help in crowd control intensive situations (azarack, spiroc, 
  bzzazzt). </LI></UL>
<H2>Warrior</H2>
<UL>
  <LI>make sure you know what your job is. Are extras going to be tanked or 
  mezzed? 
  <LI>Don't use defensive on mobs that DT. 
  <LI>If you are 55+, never waste a disc doing your crip disc or such. Unless 
  you are sure you're never going to need defensive or riposte, keep them ready, 
  you'll never know when it will keep you alive in sky. Offensive disciplines 
  are useful on some of the bosses. </LI></UL>
<H2>Monk</H2>
<UL>
  <LI>If camp is called, FD and scout so leader will know when to call all 
  clear. Bring pumice to dispell pull the avenging gazer miniboss on Gorgalusk, 
  best way to get him single. </LI></UL>
<H2>Rogue</H2>
<UL>
  <LI>assist and kill, try to avoid tanking if possible. 
  <LI>Stay alive and avoid DTs. You are the one doing all the damage. 
  <LI>Be ready to use your dodge disc on big hitting mobs on Bzzazzt and Drake 
  and Hand. </LI></UL>
<H2>Ranger</H2>
<UL>
  <LI>assist and kill, try to avoid tanking if possible. 
  <LI>A Ranger is often the best slower in sky. :) Rangers should always use 
  that Earthcaller except on lure only bosses. I've seen ranger slow mobs that 
  the 60 shaman gave up. </LI></UL>
<H2>Paladin and Shadow Knight</H2>
<UL>
  <LI>often employed as assist if low on warriors. 
  <LI>SKs with summon corpse are nice to have as backup to summon a small coffin 
  necro if for some reason your raid loses its necros. </LI></UL>
<H2>Bard</H2>
<UL>
  <LI>Debuff with Occlusions on high MR mobs.
