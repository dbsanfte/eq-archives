This is an extremely involved quest. For each piece of armor, you need to do three things.<BR><BR>

<B>Step 1:</B><BR>
You need to get the mold for the item. You do this by fetching the quest items and turning them in to the NPC who gives the item quest. You need to develop a high faction with the NPC's Guild before he or she will give you the quest. You can get the quests immediately from those who view you warmly. Those who view you amiably will request that you go to their guild and talk to someone there first before getting the quest. Those below amiable will not talk to you. Below are the people who start the quests and the methods of getting the molds for each item. All molds are no drop lore items, so whoever turns in the items must finish the quest. <BR><BR>

<A HREF="http://www.loreseekers.com/armor_detail.php3?search=274">Helm of Ro:</A> Given by Paladin Thomas (Qeynos). Faction needed with Temple of Thunder in Qeynos [Knights of Thunder].  If you are not given the quest outright, go ask someone  (not sure who) in the Temple if you have proved your nobility and if he answers yes, you have good enough faction to do the quest.  Bring him 2 skulls from the undead cyclopses  (plains of thunder/Karana) and he will reward you with the mold for the helm. <BR><BR>

<A HREF="http://www.loreseekers.com/armor_detail.php3?search=217">Gauntlets of Ro:</A> Given by Sentry Joanna (Freeport). Faction needed with the Temple of Marr in Freeport [Priests of Marr].  If you are not given the quest outright, go ask Gygus Remnara at the Temple if you are an [honored member] and if he answers yes you have good enough faction for the quest.  Bring her the locket from Sentry Alechin of Qeynos (get when he is werewolf form at night - may be called Grimtooth) and she will reward you with the mold for the Gauntlets.<BR><BR> 

<A HREF="http://www.loreseekers.com/armor_detail.php3?search=120">Greaves of Ro</A>: Given by Paladin Elisabeth [Half Elf Paladin in Freeport]. Faction needed with the Hall of Truth in Freeport [Knights of Truth].   If you are not given the quest outright, go ask Theron Rolius at the Hall am [I am honored member], and if he says yes you have good enough faction for this quest.  Bring her a head from a Nightfall Giant (West Commonlands - spawns at the druid ring right at nightfall) and she will reward you with the mold for the greaves. <BR><BR>

<A HREF="http://www.loreseekers.com/armor_detail.php3?search=160">Breastplate of Ro:</A> Given by Paladin Abigail (Felwithe). Faction needed with the Clerics of Tunare in Felwithe.  If you are not given the quest outright, go ask the leader of the church in Felwithe if you are a [honored member] and if he says yes you can do this quest. Bring her 2 Dark Cauldrons (from the cooks in Mistmoore) and she will give you the mold for the breastplate.<BR><BR> 

<A HREF="http://www.loreseekers.com/armor_detail.php3?search=121">Vambraces of Ro</A>: Given by Paladin Marianna (Qeynos). Faction  needed with the Temple of Life in Qeynos [Priests of Life]. If you are not given the quest outright, go ask High Priestess Jhanda am [I am honored member] and if she says yes you have good enough faction to do this quest.  Bring her 2 rotten shark portions from plague sharks (a rare spawn found in Erud's Crossing) and she will reward you with the mold for the vambraces. <BR><BR>

<A HREF="http://www.loreseekers.com/armor_detail.php3?search=275">Bracers of Ro:</A> Given by Paladin David [Erudite Paladin]. Faction needed with the Erudite Paladin's Guild [Deepwater Knights].  Bring him two Goblin Nets from the elusive goblin net masters/deepwater goblin netmasters (the waters of Lake Rathe) and he will reward you with the Bracer Mold.<BR><BR> 

<A HREF="http://www.loreseekers.com/armor_detail.php3?search=276">Boots of Ro:</A> Given by Paladin Nicolas [Dwarf Paladin in Kaladim]. Faction needed with the Dwarf Paladin's Guild [Clerics of Underfoot].  Bring him the plans for the Brazen Brass Kilij from a Sand Giant in South Ro and he will reward you with the mold for the boots.<BR><BR>

<B>Step 2:</B><BR>
Once you get the mold for an item, you need to talk to Lord Searfire, the Dwarven Smith in The Temple of Solusek Ro. He must consider you warmly before he will deal with you. He will then give you the Sol Cauldron and tell you how to do the next step, which is acquiring the ingredients to make the metal ronium. These are:<BR><BR>
<B>Melatite</B> (buy from Gnomes in Solusek - also sometimes dropped by some clockworks in Ak'Anon), Two Bars of Enchanted Platinum,<BR>
<B>Mistmoore Granite</B> (from Gargoyles in Mistmoore),<BR> 
<B>Sands of Ro</B> (from sand giants) and <BR>
<B>Soil of Underfoot</B> (Get from Priestess Ghalea in the Kaladim cleric's guild for 4 fairy dusts - need very high faction for this). Put them in the cauldron and hit the combine button and you will get a bar of ronium. I have been told that it is necessary for you to have a high blacksmithing skill to do this.<BR><BR>

<B>Step 3:</B><BR>
Once you get the ronium, you need to combine it with the mold in a forge to make your item. Any forge will do. You supposedly need to be a master smith to complete this step.<BR><BR>
