This is the Bard's version of the new Class Weapon Quests. It results in the <A HREF="weapon_detail.php3?search=470">Singing Short Sword</A>. Thott, of the Guild Afterlife on Mithaniel Marr has completed this quest and recieved this great new weapon.<BR><BR>

The following is a summary of all the information I have been able to find so far on this quest. The majority of the information was gathered from the <A HREF="http://www.attcanada.net/~reaper/index.html" TARGET="_new">Concert Hall</A> forums. As always, feel free to email us here with any corrections, comments, etc.<BR><BR>

The quest begins in the Dreadlands. <B>Baldric Slezaf</B> is a bard who wishes to complete a great symphony. He requires 4 items to do this, and your reward for them is the Singing Short Sword. The 4 items are...<BR><BR>

1. Top half of Page 24 of a composition by "The Maestro";<BR>
2. Bottom half of page 24;<BR>
3. Page 25;<BR>
4. Mystical Lute made by Forper Fizfla<BR><BR>

<B>Part 1:</B><BR><BR>

To get the top half of page 24, talk to <B>Konia Swiftfoot</B> in West Karana. She gives you a torch and starts you off on a relay race of some kind. First you must take the torch to <B>Fajio Knejo</B> in Misty Thicket (Near the wall guards). Next, you have to go to <B>Andad Filla</B>, who hangs around near the zone to Innothule Swamp in the Southern Desert of Ro. After that you must see <B>Misty Tekchita</B> in Lake Rathetear (near Arena zone). Finally, you take the Ring you just recieved back to Konia for the top half of page 24. <BR><BR>

<B>Part 2:</B><BR><BR>

To get the bottom half of page 24, you must also deal with Konia Swiftfoot. She will trade you the bottom half of page 24 for Mahlin's Bongos. First you must visit <B>Braenar Swiftsong</B> in South Karana. Ask him about a Doll to trigger this part of the quest. He will give you a purchase invoice that you must take to the merchant (<B>Marfen</B>) in Sol A who sells the tinkerer's bag, who will then give you a Mechanical Doll. Take the Doll and give it to Braenar's daughter <B>Serra</B> in the Estate of Unrest, who can be found next to the Gnomish Spelunker. Serra will give you a note. Take that note back to Braenar, and he will give you another note for <B>Maligar</B>. Maligar can be found in West Karana, at apx. loc +1300, -11500. When you give the note to Maligar, it will spawn his <B>Estranged Doppleganger</B> who you must kill. You will need a group of high 40's , low 50's to kill him. Loot his head and bring it back to Braenar, who will reward you with "Mahlin;s Bongos". Take the bongos back to Konia, and she will give you the bottom half of page 24.<BR><BR>

<B>Part 3:</B><BR><BR>

To get page 25 you must talk to <B>Kelkin Mekia</B> in South Karana, who wants the guts from three dragons...<BR><BR>

a. Guts from <B>Edrik the Old</B>, a named drake in Skyfire (Chromodrac guts);<BR><BR>

b. Guts from <B>Nezekezena</B>, a new Wurm in Burning Woods (Red wurm guts);<BR><BR>

c. Guts from <B>Blackwing</B>, a new onyx drake in Rathe Mountains (Huge onyx drake guts)<BR><BR>

<B>Part 4:</B><BR><BR>

To get Forpar's lute, you will have to ask the lute maker himself... <B>Forpar Fizfla</B> in Steamfont Mountains. He will send you on three quests, giving you more of the lute as you complete each one.<BR><BR>

The first quest is for the Head & Neck of the lute. Before Forpar will even discuss the lute with you, you need to visit his friend, <B>Vedico Windwisper</B>, in Butcherblock Mountains on the docks. She requires you to retrieve her horn. You must loot the Alluring Horn from <B>Quag Maelstrom</B> in the Ocean of Tears and return it to her, when she will then give you a note to take back to Forpar. Forpar will then offer to make the head & neck of the lute if you get the following items...<BR><BR>

I. Backbone of an Ancient Fisherman. Looted of <B>Phinagel</B> in Kedge Keep;<BR><BR>

II. A strong tentacle from one of the long lost amalgyms, from one of the <B>Amygdalen Tentacle Whips</B> in the Plane of Fear;<BR><BR>

III. Petrified skull of a Lycanthrope, which drops off <B>Drolvarg Warlord</B> in Karnor's Castle.<BR><BR>

After he has given you the Head & Neck of the lute, he will offer to make you the Body for the following items...<BR><BR>

IV. Large Red Dragon Scale. The red scale from <B>Talendar</B> of Skyfire has been confirmed to work;<BR><BR>

V. Large White Dragon Scale. The white scale from <B>Gorenaire</B> of the Dreadlands has been confirmed to work;<BR><BR>

VI. Metal Bits. 2 were used and confirmed to work.<BR><BR>

Finally, Folpar will complete the lute if you bring him the Undead Guts of <B>Trakanon</B> as material for the strings. Give Folpar the guts PLUS the Head & Neck PLUS the Body, and he will reward you with the Mystical Lute.<BR><BR>
