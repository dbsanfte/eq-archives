<TR><TD>This is the current quest for the <B>Electrum-Bladed Wakazashi</B>. It is not easy to complete. The Avenging Catliff is a non-aggressive npc.  You don't need any faction.  You can kill him 1000 times he will be non agrro. You hail him and he glares his fangs with a electrum bladed wakizashi.<BR><BR>
You ask him about the wakizashi and he tells you he is looking for his mother and father.  You ask him "Who is you mother?" and "Who is your father?" and he tells you Maid Issis and Butler Syncall are captives in Castle Mistmoore and he wants you to free their souls by killing them.<BR><BR>
He will reward you if you bring back their fangs to show him that you freed their souls. Maid Issis and the Butler Sincall are located fairly deep within Mistmoore.  The teeth are very rare drops (roughly 5% - and these two particular NPC's are usually camped as well).<BR><BR>
Anyway, if you're lucky enough to obtain the teeth (both of them), you simply give them to Avenging Catliff (who spawns behind the graveyard).  He will give you the EBW.  And since Avenging Catliff also drops some nice stuff, he's usually camped 24 / 7 as well (he gets to breathe Norrath air for about 3 seconds before the spells and swords start raining in).<BR><BR></TD></TR>
