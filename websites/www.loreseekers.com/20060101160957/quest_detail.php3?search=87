This is the quest for the Paladin Sword <A HREF="http://www.loreseekers.com/weapon_detail.php3?search=201">Soulfire</A>.  I have included the
details of the beginning part that anyone can do, but left out the names of the final NPC's you need to kill. Be aware that you cannot complete this quest and get Soulfire unless you have a party of adventurers well into their 40's.<BR><BR>

After completing the messenger quest, you take the Zimel's Blades price list back to Kalatrina Plossen in the Hall of Truth.  She then transcribes a little of the note, and determines that it seems to be some sort of price list.  She then sends you to speak with Rashinda (last name of Elore) at the Freeport Office of the People, but tells you to report back to her what Rashinda tells you has happened to Zimel's Blades.<BR><BR>

Once at the Office of the People, Rashinda will spill her guts if she is asked, "Have you heard of Zimel's Blades?".  She then goes in to detail about the owner being [Ariska Zimel], and that Zimel's Blades was condemned after Zimel's disappearance.  Zimel's Blades was a weapons shop in East Freeport which was condemned by the city.  She mentions that Groflah Steadirt bought most of the scraps that were left of Zimel's Blades.  Obviously the next question is to ask Rashinda about Ariska Zimel (a simple "Who was Ariska Zimel?" suffices).  She then goes in to the fact that Ariska Zimel was an extraordinary blacksmith who also was a great adventurer.  She says that he and Groflah Steadirt were best friends and adventured together until each of them settled in Freeport.  She then mentions Zimel's disappearance again, and says that you should go speak to Groflah, because he could give you more information about Zimel then she can.  Somewhere in this mess of conversation, after she mentions Zimel, and you ask her about him, she mentions Steadirt again.  This is the time to ask her about Groflah Steadirt, and again, a simple "Who is Groflah Steadirt?" will suffice.<BR><BR>

Okay, so now that you have all of this information, you're supposed to return to Kalatrina Plossen at the Hall of Truth and tell her that "Zimel's Blades was condemed".  Where upon she wonders why Lucan would visit a condemned building.  She figures he must be searching for something, and mentions that when she last visited the local forge (must be Groflah's, but she doesn't say that) she heard rumors of Lucan searching for a sword named Soulfire.  She then says if that is true, then you must find it first, as no more power must go Lucan's way.  She then say's "Seek this sword out."  Don't give her the price list, because she won't give it back and you need it to continue.<BR><BR>

The purpose of the price list is to get Groflah to open up to you, instead of telling you that he's never heard of Zimel's Blades and to go away, because he's busy and can't speak there.  His response after receiving the price list is, and I quote:  " Where did you find this?  This was the main price list of Zimel's Blades, but it should be all burnt up.  I was at Zimel's right after the fire and I did not see it hanging where it should have been.  The entire inside was gutted and.... Wait.... The sequence of the dots!!!  Hmmm.  I cannot talk with you here.  Meet me at the Seafarers by the docks at night.  Give me the note when next we meet."  End quote.<BR><BR>

To get Groflah to talk you have to be in a certain tavern in East Freeport around 5 or 6am.  He will appear and wag his tongue freely (presumably from the liquor).  He'll tell you about Tumpy Tonics (apparently all dwarves are lushes) and will talk about Zimel, relating the story about what it was that Zimel found, why he disappeared and who the culprit is.<BR><BR>

You must then talk to the beggar Tykar Renlin, who shows up at the Seafarer's roost. You need to give him 4 droms champagnes, one at a time, to get him to talk.   He will talk to you and give you a blanket.  It turns out that Zimel is being held prisoner down below the arena (I think it may be cell block number 4).  When you talk to Zimel, he says something that ends with "bog n goo".  When you give him edible goo (from cooking), he then says " bog n goo.  Blanket too!"  What you need to do is give him edible goo, bog juice, and the blanket.  Bog juice can be made by a brewer.  After giving him the bog juice and goo, you will receive a banker's key "H.K. 102" for High Keep.<BR><BR>

You need to give this to the bank clerk in highhold and she will give you a note to deliver to Brother Hayle in Splitpaw.<BR><BR>

He will tell you the items you need to collect to get soulfire:  The Hilt of Soulfire, the Brilliant Sword of Faith, Your Testimony and the letter you received from the bank clerk.  The hilt is obtained by killing a high level NPC, per Hayle's instructions. The <A HREF="http://www.loreseekers.com/weapon_detail.php3?search=46">Brilliant Sword of Faith</A> is found by killing Sir Lucan and returning the testimony you find on him to Valeron.  The testimony for this quest is obtained through doing the <A HREF="http://www.loreseekers.com/quest_detail.php3?search=86">Test of Truth</A> quest.<BR><BR>
