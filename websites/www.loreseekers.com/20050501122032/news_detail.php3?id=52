Maldian sent me a screenshot where Shakarra tells the guild : "Truce".
<P>
After all that has happened I cross-checked this with Shakarra herself, and she has sent me the following message :

<P>
> Hail<BR>
><BR>
> The matter has been rectified. Though I was not compensated to the full<BR>
> extent of my loss, I will leave the matter be. If it was not for you, I am<BR>
> sure nothing would have ever happened. I thank you for all your time and<BR>
> effort in this situation. For the record I recieved 127pp and 1 Bloodforge<BR>
> hammer. Take care and thank you once again for your hand in this matter.<BR>
><BR>
>          Sincerely,<BR>
>          Shakarra Silverheart<BR>
>          Guards of Honor, Knight of Truth<BR>
<BR>
<P>
I hope all of us have learned from this, I personally am very careful when it comes to accepting or giving consents, I have seen far too many people lose their equipment. For the record : I don't think Maldian stole anything, I believe him when he states it was due to lag, and a bug. And I fully understand why Shakarra got so angry, who wouldn't if you lost every piece of equipment you have worked for so hard to get !
<P>
Hereby I declare this chapter in the history of the Seekers of Lore closed !
