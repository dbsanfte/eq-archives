	<P>
	<FONT SIZE="-1">
	Twas the night before christmas<BR>
	and all through the guild<BR>
	everyone was stirring<BR>
	for the raid to be soon held<BR>
	<P>
	Blades were soon sharpened<BR>
	spells were quickly spun<BR>
	and requests came flowing<BR>
	for the now active jewelers fund<BR>
	<P>
	But the occasion was not joyous<BR>
	for there was a horrid tale<BR>
	Of many kendrid elves held in slavery<BR>
	and forced to work a living .....well<BR>
	<P>
	They were forced to work in shackles<BR>
	And edible goo was their fare<BR>
	They worked for a cruel master<BR>
	who for their health did not care<BR>
	<P>
	So the seekers came to pay a visit<BR>
	Upon this creature this night<BR>
	to free their captured Brethren<BR>
	To lead them to the light<BR>
	<P>
	Then the cry came from Foladen<BR>
	to attack with no mercy<BR>
	to beat the merciless beast<BR>
	and take your time do not hurry<BR>
	<P>
	Twas Dinia and Hrvatsko<BR>
	and Shraeven and Nekkon<BR>
	there was Trinitii and Blackmaer<BR>
	and of course. Dip was not forgotten<BR>
	<P>
	Onward they charged<BR>
	with lust for battle in their eyes<BR>
	while singing out<BR>
	"The Fat man must die!!!"<BR>
	<P>
	And on fought the guild<BR>
	and not a single one was slew<BR>
	for those who stand against us<BR>
	are far and very few<BR>
	<P>
	When the dust had cleared<BR>
	and the battle was over<BR>
	of the enemy only one stood<BR>
	the fat man, the reindeer lover<BR>
	<P>
	With a sense of irony<BR>
	(and a good sense of humor)<BR>
	They chained him to his own sled<BR>
	and spread a few good rumors<BR>
	<P>
	And with a smile on his face<BR>
	and tipsy from drink and fight<BR>
	Foladen shouted merry christmas to all<BR>
	and to all a good night<BR>
