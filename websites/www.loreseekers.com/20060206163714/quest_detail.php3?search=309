<FONT SIZE="2" FACE="ariel">
<B>Star Ruby - 70pp</B> - NPC in Felwithe, near fishing shop or Qeynos Jewelry shop.<BR>

<B>Update:</B><BR>
Two Dwarven brothers at an inn in the Western Commonlands will resize your crafted armor to be more suitable for the small races. They will take any crafted armor that is All sizes, All classes, and turn it into Small Crafted which is for Dwarf, Gnome, Halfling, High Elf, and Wood Elf  only, but has the added benefit of being lighter! For example, crafted gauntlets were WT. 5.0 before, and 3.7 after resizing.<BR><BR>

<B>Ranvigoz Tonsmith</B> will resize Crafted Bracers, Greaves, a Pauldrun or a Breastplate.  His brother <B>Timtok Tonsmith</B> will resize Crafted Gauntlets, a Vambrace, a Helm or Boots. I successfully converted my gauntlets with only an indifferant faction.<BR><BR>
