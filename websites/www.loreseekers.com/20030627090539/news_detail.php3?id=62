<FONT SIZE="3" FACE ="ariel"><B>I</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="2" FACE ="ariel">f any of the following account is in error, my apologies to its worthy  participants! Yet am I most happy to announce that the assault we planned on  the Deep Water and Aqua Goblins of Oasis in Tarew Marr was successful. </FONT><BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE="3" FACE ="ariel"><B>M</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="2" FACE ="ariel">embers Patriquin, Aetherum, Frashii, Therros and myself, aided by others at  various times (particularly Filladari the Wizardess), were not satisfied with merely the DWG of Oasis, but went on to Lake Rathe as well, despoiling those accursed fiends of their Spoke of the Wheel of Tarton. In Oasis, I was somewhat delayed due to the need to find our worthy Shaman Troll Aetherum for a supply of fishscales. Hearing an urgent call across the ether from Aetherum, that someone else had raided the DWG and that they were 
not "in residence", I transported myself to Oasis, and entered the water. </FONT><BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE="3" FACE ="ariel"><B>A</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="2" FACE ="ariel">rriving above the Tower of the Deep water goblins, I espied the Spoke lying on the top floor, by use of my spell Magnify. Calling upon Aetherum and Patriquin, who were immediately at hand, they launched an attack on the remaining DWG whilst I entered, grabbed the Spoke and gated to Southern Ro. </FONT><BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE="3" FACE ="ariel"><B>I</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="2" FACE ="ariel">n the meantime, the intrepid dual, Aetherum and our guild's High Cleric Patriquin, gave the goblins a good run, ultimately joining me just inside the SRO border. After mutual congratulations, we decided to continue despoiling Aqua Goblins of the wizardly treasure that they did not own, and I opened a Portal to North Karena, where we met our dear bard Frashii the Brave-Hearted. We continued across the god Karenas' Southern Plains, entering the realm known as Lake Rathetear. Here, I led the party to the Island known as Blue Flame, and alternately as Jacob's Ladder. </FONT><BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE="3" FACE ="ariel"><B>K</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="2" FACE ="ariel">nown to few outside my wizardly circles, on its Western flank exists an underwater cavern, deep, deep under the surface of the Lake. This cavern, at the Roots of the World, contains a citadel of the accursed Deep Water Goblins, in which they hoard a spoke of  the Wheel. Entering Invisible, Levitating, Enduring Breath, and with other supernatural aids, the party proceeded down to the very depths of Sheol itself. Here, where perhaps Jonah found himself in the belly of a great fish, we found the accursed foe. </FONT> <BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE="3" FACE ="ariel"><B>D</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="2" FACE ="ariel">isaster struck, due, I confess, to my clumsiness. Perched on the top of the tower, restraining myself from drifting lower, I sent messages to our intrepid band. Whilst speaking with them, I did not notice that I had 
drifted further down from the ceiling of this subterranean and subaqueous realm, and was attacked by the foe. Frashii of the Elegant Tones, sacrificed her life for our band, and her corpse, I am grieved to say, remains there to this moment, as her spirit is restrained by the great god Pan Verant from yet returning into Norrath's realm. The others escaped with their lives, but my sorry self paid the more than dear price of returning to the 30th Circle (yet again for the 3rd time). </FONT><BR><BR>
 
<FONT SIZE="3" FACE ="ariel"><B>I</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="2" FACE ="ariel">n time we regrouped at the Arena Mouth in Lake Rathe. Our Dear Troll Aetherum, and the High Cleric Patriquin, restrained by forces unknown, and extreme fatigue, were required to depart. At this point, all could have gone ill, but Therros of the Art Necromantic, hearing my call across the ether, came, as did a worthy wizard friend of Aetherum and myself, Filladari. Re-entering the Nether realm, Therros of the Living Dead, Filladari and myself approached the hideous Tower. This time, I was careful to sit on the rim of the upper parapets thereof, whilst from such vantage, seeing all of the enemy below, I could direct Therros in his assault, whilst Filladari stood ready to Evacuate us by Wizardly Means. The worthy Therros commenced the attack; I dove to the upper floor and, grasping the Spoke, began to gate as agreed. Seeing that Therros was receiving an adverse quantity of  abuse from the Foe, I switched tactics and commenced Evacuate myself in case Filladari should fail. Woe! Filladari and myself found ourselves hurtling  through the ether, good Therros having sent his soul wherever Necromancers' souls go upon their demise (shudder). ["Ah, said Therros, "I feel much better now."] </FONT><BR><BR>
 
<FONT SIZE="3" FACE ="ariel"><B>H</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="2" FACE ="ariel">earing that Therros was in Neriak, I transported myself to West Commons. After procuring a substantial quantity of Fishscales in East Commons (most westerly inn sells these and batwings in its outbuilding), I returned through the ether with the Naked Necromancer, to the Northern Plains of my god, Karenas. Passing quickly South, we returned to the Lake known as Rathetear, and with the help of a wonderful shaman Tearin, were able to re-enter the netherworld. Tearin, despairing of light and life quickly returned to the surface, but I accompanied our Necrotic Fiend (err, I mean "Friend") Therros, and had the Unique delight of discovering HIS remains (there's a switch for you, I see the Qeynos Times headlines now, "WIZARD FINDS NECROS BODY: Inquest Scheduled for Cross-Caster Violations"). Returning to the surface, we reclothed Therros in his belongings, and returned to mediate upon these events. </FONT> <BR><BR>
