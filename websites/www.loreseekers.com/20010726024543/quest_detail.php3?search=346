<B>WARNING!</B><BR><BR>

This is a straight spoiler for this most holy of Paladin swords. Do not read if you wish to be a true Paladin and obtain by your own perseverance and dedication.<BR><BR>

It seems because of the complexity of the quest in it's old form, and the failure of anyone to solve it, they have made the new quest relatively simple. However, all the steps in the new quest are doable only by very high level (+46) Paladins with many people helping them (Better join a dragon and Plane raiding guild here, if you ever want this sword).<BR><BR>

<I>Inte Akera</I>, in the Plane of Sky will give you the Fiery Avenger if you can give him the four items listed below. Be warned that if your faction is not "amiable" or higher with him, he will take these very valuable items and give nothing in return.<BR><BR>

<B>1. The Blessing of Nobility:</B> This note is given to you by Akera in exchange for you sacrificing your <A HREF="http://www.loreseekers.com/quest_detail.php3?search=87">Soulfire</A> to him as a gift.<BR><BR>

<B>2. The Blessing of Sacrafice:</B> This note is given to you by Akera in exchange for you sacrificing your <A HREF="http://www.loreseekers.com/weapon_detail.php3?search=90">Ghoulbane</A> to him as a gift.<BR><BR>

<B>3 + 4. Head and Robe of Miragul:</B> This NPC has changed a bit since the new quest was put in. Seems Miragul is now a Lich, haunting the caves under Everfrost. To get him to return to his human form, you must give him his soul back. His soul is being held in a book called <B>Miragul's Phylactery</B> which was broken up into two pieces of scale. One piece is kept on each Dragon of Norrath. When you have both pieces, combine them to make the Book of Scale. Take this book to the Oracle in Ocean of Tears and he will then give you the Phylactery.<BR><BR>

You have to give the Phylactery to the Lich to make Miragul respawn as his old self. Please note that you must have a good faction with the Lich to accomplish this. You can raise your faction by doing the <A HREF="http://www.loreseekers.com/quest_detail.php3?search=384">Azraxs' Legacy</A> quest in Paineel.<BR><BR>

Once you give the Phylactery back to the Lich the true Miragul will spawn. You must then kill him to get his head and robe to complete the items need for the Fiery Avenger.<BR><BR>
