Date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;01-27-2003 20:20<br><br>
Hail and well met; and greetings from the Vigils of Norrath! Allow me to introduce myself; I am Finnigan, a Ranger of Karana now in my 44th season. I belong to a small guild of some fifteen or so individuals from Surefall Glade.<BR>
<BR>
[OOC: We are a small, role-playing guild of mid-level characters (20's thru 40's)on Morell Thule Server]<BR>
<BR>
I have been sent by my guild to seek your aid in a matter that may be of some interest to you. It is a rather complicated tale that will take some time in the telling, so please hear me out.<BR>
<BR>
Several months past, I found myself alone in Surefall Glade with the exception of a young Bard named Tiliki.  This young Bard seemed quite upset and was very insistent, so I stopped to speak with her. She spoke to me in a language that I had never heard before, and at first I thought she must be a stranger to Norrath, <BR>
<BR>
[OOC: I believed she was speaking a language other than English] <BR>
<BR>
or perhaps that she was addled in the head or playing a prank on me. Never-the-less, I listened to what she had to say, and wrote down as much of it as I could remember.<BR>
<BR>
[OOC: when it became obvious to me that I had stumbled onto something interesting, I made a copy of my EQ log, and later wrote down what she had said]<BR>
<BR>
Days later when I recounted this same tale to my Guild two of our members, Wawen and Kanae, determined, (with difficulty), that the language which Tiliki had been speaking was the Language of the Gargoyles. But more importantly, was the truly remarkable document she recited!<BR>
<BR>
Tiliki recited (sang) an epic tale of not less than fifteen 'books' in length. It is an incredibly complex document, and we have determined the titile to be: The Codex of Forgotten Virtue. The Codex, so far as we have been able to determine, is written in no less than three different languages: The Common Tongue, [OOC: English], Old Erudian, [OCC: Latin], and Gargish [OOC: A Fantasy Language which we believe has it's origins in the UO millieu]. It is written in verse, <BR>
<BR>
[OOC:all of which rhymes--even the Gargish--which we find incredible in and of itself]<BR>
<BR>
and contains many riddles, clues, and secret messages cleverly imbedded within the text. Certain references within the text clearly refer to personages and locations associated with Norrath, ( Karana, The Plane of Hate, The Serpent's Spine), but others are more cryptic and we have been unable to determine what their meaning may be. <BR>
<BR>
However it is clear to us from the mention of various Deities and the Planes of Power, that the Codex refers to locations and tasks far beyond the experience and abilities of our small group. Having looked closely at your Guild Site, it is evident that you possess the expertise, experience, and resources, that would be required to pursue this matter any further.<BR>
<BR>
Therefore, as a gesture of friendship, we are presenting what we have learned about this Quest to you in the hope that you may be able to enlighten us, based on your extensive research into the history of Norrath.<BR>
<BR>
[OOC: The text of the Codex, as well as our thoughts, investigations, discoveries and insights into the matter may be found at the following location:]<BR>
<BR>
pub70.ezboard.com/bvigilsofnorrath<BR>
<BR>
[OOC: The information is under the the category, MEMBER'S QUESTS under the topic, "U LOK PRAE-TIM-DE LING?" (which we have translated to mean, "Do you speak the Ancient Language?")]<BR>
<BR>
If you have an interest in investigating this further, then we urge you to visit our guild at the above location. Any help, advice, insights, or comments you may have are welcomed and appreciated.<BR>
<BR>
Thank you for your time and patience in allowing us to recount our tale, and we wish you all luck in battle, and good fortune on whatever paths you may find yourselves.<BR>
<BR>
[OOC: We spent quite a lot of time investigating this riddle, and have reached the conclusion that this is a quest unique to Morell Thule Server (probably sponsored by a high level guild), that might have been put together to coincide with the release of PoP.  Incidentally, Tiliki disappeared for about a month after first encountering her, then re-surfaced, and presented her tale again to various people around Qeynos ans Surefall Glade, and has now disappeared again.  If the pattern repeats itself, she should be seen again soon.  Any help you can offer as to the identification of various locations, or individuals mentioned in the Codex would be GREATLY appreciated!] <BR>

We are also posting the original text of the Codex here, though I warn you it is quite lengthy, and I urge you to visit the website listed for Vigils to save yourself much duplication of effort<BR>

-------------------------------
Hail and well met; and greetings from the Vigils of Norrath! Allow me to introduce myself; I am Finnigan, a Ranger of Karana now in my 44th season. I belong to a small guild of some fifteen or so individuals from Surefall Glade.

[OOC: We are a small, role-playing guild of mid-level characters (20's thru 40's)on Morell Thule Server]

I have been sent by my guild to seek your aid in a matter that may be of some interest to you. It is a rather complicated tale that will take some time in the telling, so please hear me out.

Several months past, I found myself alone in Surefall Glade with the exception of a young Bard named Tiliki.  This young Bard seemed quite upset and was very insistent, so I stopped to speak with her. She spoke to me in a language that I had never heard before, and at first I thought she must be a stranger to Norrath, 

[OOC: I believed she was speaking a language other than English] 

or perhaps that she was addled in the head or playing a prank on me.
