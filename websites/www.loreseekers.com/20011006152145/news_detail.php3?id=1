<B>When:</B> Wednesday July 14th at 17:30 PT<BR>
<B>Where:</B> Freeport Docks<BR>
<B>Server:</B> Tarew Marr<BR>
<B>Who:</B> Everyone is welcome! <BR><BR>

Hail and well met fellow Norrathian's.<BR><BR>
I, Aviger, your humble cleric friend is organizing this
grand event to celebrate the creation of my own guild Fal
'Ngeestra. We are not official yet but are awaiting
approval. This Drunken Cruise will be not only be a guild
celebration but also a grand fest for all people who love to
roleplay and want to have some fun doing it! We will be
leaving Freeport and sailing the seas on Wednesday the
14th at 17:30 PT. The friendly people of the Seekers Of
Lore guild will be lending me their master brewer
Nathaniel to make the booze, but this does not mean you
cannot bring yer own! Any beginning or master brewers
wanting to up their skills are welcome to mail me at
cruise@horza.xs4all.nl and join us to make the people
drunk.<BR><BR>

I would also like to have some teleport capable people
there to help the (probably large number) people that fall
in the water, so they can be teleported back to port. I
know you can't cast on boats but when their in the water
they sure can...any people capable and willing to help
also mail me at cruise@horza.xs4all.nl<BR><BR>

Depending on how many people show up we might
disperse over the 2 boats along the route...<BR><BR>

Finally, I want to invite any GM's and employees of
Verant to join us in this fest, to celebrate their creation of
this great game and to give the GM's a pat on the back.
We all have horrorstories of GM's doing stuff wrong in our
eyes but these guys ARE doing the best they can with
limited people. SO please come so we can show you we
care (and to get you drunk so you might give us items
and power ;-))<BR><BR>

Lastly, anyone interested in joining our new guild , which
is a mostly roleplaying guild with a lot of fun and
friendship thrown in, is welcome to come to our pages at
http://www.rpgamers.net/fng<BR><BR>

I hope to see a lot of you double on Wednesday!<BR><BR>

Thanks Zakalwe! <B>MadWand</B><BR>
