			<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Note on use of assuming the reader is male:</B> I’m a guy, I default to this form of speech, and it’s lengthy and hard to go through and try to catch myself and type he/she, etc at every spot.  If this offends someone I’m sorry, just assume I mean he/she.</P>
			<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> </P>
			<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Assumption:</B> I assume in this that you have someone available to enchant your metals.  Enchanters can obtain the enchant silver spell from Neriak ONLY so it’s best to know someone that can get it for you.  (Hi Nathaniel!)   Enchanters get this spell at level 8 and do not obtain the enchant electrum spell until lvl 16.  The electrum jewelry contains a lot of what is most sought after right now (probably because most people either don’t have the skill or don’t have anyone to enchant their electrum).  Strength Earrings, Jade Bracelets, Wisdom Earrings are just some of the few.</P>
			<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> </P>
			<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Starting Skill:</B> I recommend spending as many skill points as possible (up to 21) in this skill, as you will thus bypass all of the useless items.</P>
			<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> </P>
			<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Purpose of Skill:</B> Jewelcraft is not a very good moneymaker.  It is not quick, it is not easy, and it is definitely not inexpensive.  Unless you are out there with a high lvl enchanter that can enchant platinum and you are selling platinum ruby veils for 1000pp each, you will probably never see your initial investment back.  A jewelcrafter practices his skill so that he can have magical items at a relatively low cost.  They also make EXCELENT trade fodder.  I traded a plus two strength ring (cost to me of about 2pp or so) for a squad ring today for example.  I find this a perfectly acceptable trade, considering that the squad ring is much more useful to me than the two strength ring.  Other items I have gotten include runed totem staves, gossamer armor, dwarven chainmail, shiny brass shields, and other monster loot items.  With jewelcraft you can make excellent magical items for yourself.  I find it most rewarding to look at my characters inventory and see all of the handmade jewelcraft that <B>I</B> made myself.</P>
			<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> </P>
			<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Getting Started:</B> Unless for some reason your city does not sell the required components (most cities I have been to do) you should always use your home city for buying/selling.  I did most of my work in Kelethin as a high elf, and this was a mistake.  In Kelethin I sold my jewelry back at a slight loss where as in Felwithe I could sell back at a slight gain or at least break even.  </P>
			<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now that you know where to base your operations, lets move on to supplies.  You will need a Jewelry Kit, Stones and Metals.  The starting metal you will be working with is silver.  Again, I recommend you have someone to enchant it for you otherwise your wares will have no value to anyone other than the NPC merchant.  This includes having no value to yourself which as I mentioned before I find the most fulfilling part of Jewelcraft.  </P>
			<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> </P>
			<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First Item:</B> If you can get your skill up to 21, I recommend the first items you try combining are silver and cats eye agate.  This is a relatively low cost item that creates a necklace that gives three charisma.  Do this item first because unless your charisma is at 92 or above, you can get better pricing and thus aid your jewelcraft even further. (Note: If your charisma is 106 or above, you can get pricing as good as you could in your home city in other friendly cities… for example, I’m a High Elf.  Opals cost 17pp in Felwithe, and with my base charisma, they cost around 19pp in Kelethin.  After wearing all of my charisma boosting items to get my charisma up to 106, Opals now cost 17pp in Kelethin)  If you cannot get your jewelcraft up this high, I recommend starting with one of the lesser jewels until they become trivial (I didn’t keep record of this unfortunately) but do not bother enchanting them because they produce worthless items that neither you or any PC would want unless they have very specialized needs.</P>
			<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> </P>
			<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To produce your item:</B> Place ONE gem and ONE silver bar into the jewelcraft kit and hit combine.  Either you get a nice sparkly piece of jewelry on your mouse or you get that dreaded red message in your text.</P>
			<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> </P>
			<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you can successfully produce the cats eye necklace, then I recommend moving on to the bloodstone earrings which are next.  Be sure to equip the necklace as soon as you produce a magical one.  Remember that jewelry that is made with normal silver bars will never be magical and is useless, just sell it back to the vendor for some profit.</P>
			<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> </P>
			<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You will want to keep a few of the items you create, for example, the wisdom rings.  Increasing your wisdom means a decrease in the amount of failures.  Sometimes this is the key to a successful jewelcrafter, and was my key to riches the day of the trade patch.  I had only a skill of twenty four in jewelcrafting at the start of the day, and managed to make 150pp, three sets of dwarven chainmail, a shiny brass shield, and up to 41 skill (point at which jade rings become trivial) by the end of the day.  How?  Because even though my skill went up very slowly, I maintained the cash flow by being able to provide my customers with their items with as few failures as possible.  The fewer failures in this expensive skill, the more likely you are to see the elusive profit margin.  Another set of valuable rings are the intelligence rings.  If you are just playing with electrum and don’t care to sell the items because they are either worthless or you can’t enchant them, then getting skill points is more important than money, because this is obviously why you are endeavoring to work with such a gem/metal combination.  Failures will happen no matter what your wisdom or skill, and the first time I fail on a silver ruby veil even though it’s trivial, I will be really upset, but it will not be unexpected.  (now the second, third or fourth try especially if they are all in a row…)  Another note on failures…  I have heard from numerous places that Everquest’s random number generator is broken.  I try to take this into effect, and if I have a failure, I just take a deep breath, wait for a little and then try again.  Especially if I am working with something that is thirty or so points below my trivial level.</P>
			<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> </P>
			<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The other file with this guide is a spreadsheet listing all possible combinations, and some profit margin evaluations.  Keep all of your monster looted jewels.  This will save you more money than you make in profit from selling them I assure you, even and especially the low ones like hematite.  There comes a point in jewelcraft when silver jewelry is too expensive to practice with.  It is at this point (usually when you can start producing silver opal rings) that you should move on to electrum jewelry.  Even if you can’t enchant it, you will want the practice so that you might have a possibility of making the all-powerful and most wanted silver ruby veils (plus four strength plus four wisdom).  To increase your skill always work from the least expensive gem up to the most expensive gem until it is more feasible to go with the next metal because of your cost.  You will probably have to go up to the silver opal rings before you acquire enough skill to successfully play with electrum.  After playing with pottery today, I find that this logic may be flawed, but I find that spending two platinum to fail will not let you play with an item for very long, unless you have an unlimited cash supply.  (Possibly pairing this with the pottery skill might be very nice, assuming you have the patience to do pottery for long enough to get a nice sum of money, and then watch it all get eaten by jewelcraft)</P>
			<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> </P>
			<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The way to make money with this skill isn’t a fast one, nor is it an easy one… you will have to sell to PC’s at reasonable prices.  I got lucky and raised most of my skill the day that the trade patch came out, so I had a massive influx of money for my items because 1) they were new 2) I was on the server first thing and was in Greater Faydark, probably one of the most crowded zones in the game.  I am lucky in being based in Greater Faydark because of the large traffic of people coming in and out of the zone, either to crushbone, on their way to unrest from ak’anon, going from butcherblock to the largest city zone in the game, where you can be bound right inside of an orc tent or at the entrance to any of four zones.  Anyway, I digress.  I usually offer my wares with a macro (warning, if you use shout in a macro, only the first shout will go through, you will have to use enter, shift+up, and enter to repeat the additional lines or you will find yourself under a barrage of questions that you thought that you just answered).  I take the initial influx of orders (sometimes up to three if I’m lucky), then announce to everyone that you have stopped taking orders for a while.  This is important, as you do not want to keep your customers waiting for long while you create your items.  If you do so it is very likely that another jeweler will come into your zone and sell for less than you.  The prices I have posted are just a suggestion, but will get you a reasonable profit margin.</P>
			<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Either run back to your nearby city zone where you can get the materials, or reach into your trusty backpack that you have full of materials.  I advise keeping the gems and the silver separate until you are ready to sell because they take up less backpack space this way.  You can stack 20 bars of silver and say.. four each of each useful gem in a backpack, where as if you made all of the items you would need twenty slots or so and might not sell all of the items.  Do not sell back the unused gems if you go this route… You will always be selling another day and just take this backpack out, refill it with the gems you did sell, and go out there and sell again.  Many different people need many different things.  The silver opal engagement rings usually sell for about 30pp.  Who would want three stamina and two agility you say?   How about a monk?  This is a perfect ring for them and they are most likely to pay the price.  I recommend going to a zone like oasis or something for these items though, because 1) there are likely to be human monks there, and 2) they are likely to have the cash to spend.</P>

			<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have made the following <A HREF="http://files.loreseekers.com/files/jewel_table.html">Jewelry Charts</A> to use as a reference with this guide. The first is a compilation of all possible jewelcraft combinations. The second is a detailed analysis of Silver Jewelcraft. The third is a detailed analysis of Electrum Jewelcraft. And the fourth is a Trivial Table. You will notice we need more input on the trivial table as I am unable to "go back" in time and note when things became trivial. If any new jewelry makers can keep detailed notes of their trivial levels, we would appreciate recieving them for addition into this guide.</P></FONT>
