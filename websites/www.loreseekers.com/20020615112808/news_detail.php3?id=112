There has been a burning debate on the Gameplay forum over at Sony's official EQ website, over the rumors of Verant scanning customer's hard drives in an effort to stop cheaters and hackers. Rumors have been surfacing for days about this, and finally Verant broke silence with a post on a possible change to the End User License Agreement that all players must agree to before logging into EQ.  The wording of this clause was very ambiguous, and would have given Verant permission to scan almost any area of your hard drives and/or system memory, and to upload such information as they deemed fit to their systems in San Diego. <BR><BR>

Understandably, a huge debate ensued, and many of the people involved (myself included) felt this was an invasion of privacy and should not be allowed. <BR><BR>

Upon seeing the intensity of reactions from so many players, Verant's CEO and President, John Smedley made a decision to post a game-poll about this issue. He then surprised almost everyone by posting again later on that Verant will not be, after all, doing ANY scans of customer's computers, beyond the normal patching process scanning.  This was very welcome news to many!<BR><BR>

Dear EverQuest Players, <BR><BR>

An exciting time is now at hand. Within the next 2 days the Login Servers will be coming down and we will be doing a patch that will add the EverQuest Store into the front end of the game. At that time, the first product we will be offering will be the EverQuest: Ruins of Kunark (RoK) upgrade for existing customers. This will allow existing customers of EverQuest to purchase RoK for $16.95 (Plus S&H). In addition, we will offer various shipping options depending on which country you live in. EverQuest: Ruins of Kunark will be launching on April 24th. We want to insure that this product is in everybody's hands on or before that date. <BR><BR>

In addition to this change, we will also be modifying our User Agreement and Software License to add in some additional Terms and Conditions that we will require everyone to agree to before playing EverQuest. <BR><BR>

The first of these changes concerns the selling of EverQuest Characters and Items outside of the game (i.e. things like Ebay). Here is the text of this change: <BR><BR>

"You may not sell or auction anyEverQuest characters, items,coin or copyrighted material." <BR><BR>

You may ask why we are doing this. There are many reasons, but first and foremost of them is the amount of trouble this is causing our Customer Service group. Simply put there are a lot of people out there who defraud others and we are being put in the middle of it, and we don't have the time or the resources to assist people with these disputes when they arise. The next reason is a more philosophical one and that is that we believe people should have to earn their items and characters in the game rather than from buying them outside the game. Obviously the second point can be argued from other perspectives that we do in fact respect, but we wanted you to hear ours. <BR><BR>

The next change to the User Agreement and Software license concerns our efforts to stop people from hacking EverQuest and from doing malicious acts that we feel can affect EverQuest as an ongoing business concern. We have developed the technology to check for these hacking tools/programs and report that fact back to us. Without getting into the specifics of this technology, I can say that we in no way will search a user's hard drive(aside from the EverQuest directory during the patching process), registry nor will we send back any information other than the fact that a user is in fact running one of these programs (specifically we are NOT sending information about everything the user is running back to our servers). It's disturbing that the amount of recent developments in the hacking community force us to do this. Many will say "ShowEQ" isn't worth worrying about. To us, it's cheating and it's not something we can allow in a game like EverQuest where it affects other people's enjoyment of the game. In addition, although this is the first time we'll be acknowledging this, ShowEQ isn't the worst offender. Recently we had someone attempting to bring down our servers with another malicious program. We were able to quickly identify what was going on and insure this didn't happen again, but nonetheless the potential is there and we need to be able to quickly identify and stop these types of programs. Again, I want to say it clearly that we will in NO WAY send any information back to the Everquest servers other than information regarding programs that we feel interfere with the intended operation of EverQuest. We have had this technology available for some time, but recently we've found it's going to be neccessary to go to greater lengths to stop this kind of thing. To those of you concerned about privacy (and rightly so) I want to say that we feel it's neccessary to do this but we want you to be informed that we are going to try these measures to protect both ourselves and the game's players. <BR><BR>

Here is the text of this change: <BR><BR>

"You hereby grant us permission to download Game-related files to you. You also grant us permission to access, extract and upload (i) Game-related data as part of the patching process and (ii) data relating to any program that we, in our reasonable discretion, determine interferes with the proper operation of EverQuest." <BR><BR>

Thanks, <BR><BR>

I've read enough on this board to realize that when it comes to people's privacy, opinions run hot. I've carefully considered many of the arguments that people are making regarding this issue. <BR><BR>

We've decided to put up a Poll tomorrow in EverQuest. The poll will read: <BR>
-------------------<BR>
Are you comfortable with the EverQuest client checking to see if you are running programs that are capable of cheating in EverQuest and reporting that back to our servers? <BR><BR>

No? <BR>

Yes? <BR>
---------------------<BR>

Note that I put the No first (to counter the argument that people just click on the first thing they read). <BR><BR>

I think in a case like this it's prudent for us to check with our userbase before we make this level of a change. <BR><BR>

We'll let you know the results and what we plan to do about it tomorrow afternoon some time. <BR><BR>

Btw.. that's the best wording I could come up with, but I'm willing to look at other wordings, provided they are all Yes/No Questions. <BR><BR>

Regards, <BR><BR>

Ok. We put the poll in, and with roughly 15,000 people participating the poll came up with 83% of the people being fine with us running the check for cheating. <BR><BR>

DESPITE THIS POLL we have decided that it's the wrong thing to do. Enough people have convinced us that it's chipping away a little too much at people's privacy EVEN if they do consent for us to implement this policy. <BR><BR>

Therefore, the change to the EULA will read as follows: <BR><BR>

Solely for the purpose of patching and updating the Game, you hereby grant us permission to (i) upload Game file information from the Everquest directory and (ii) download Game files to you. <BR><BR>

Now, before anyone wonders exactly what this is, let me explain. Technically speaking we probably should have had this language in there from day one for you to consent us to even download new game files to you in the first place. We apologize for not realizing that we should have gotten this consent, but live and learn. <BR><BR>

We can admit when we make mistakes, and I believe this is a case where we owe an apology to our Playerbase. In our haste to try and thwart people from damaging the game we went overboard. <BR><BR>

There will be absolutely no scanning of anyones computer for any reason other than the normal patching process (which won't do any sort of checking on what you have running). <BR><BR>
