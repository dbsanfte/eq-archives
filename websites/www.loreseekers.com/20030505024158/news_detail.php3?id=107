The "Play Nice" rules that Verant was experimenting with before have been rewritten and will go into effect soon across all servers equally. Below is the original post on the official Gameplay forum that informed us of this change, and Gordon Wrinn's responses that confirm the information. On a personal note… I finally canceled my account last week, after continued disinterest in the game and frustration over the over-crowding, and I can whole heartily say I am very glad I am not still around to have to deal with these new policies! They are so full of exploitable loop-holes it is laughable, and I wouldn't be surprised if individual GM's start ignoring them and enforcing their own version of them.<BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Original Post:</FONT><BR><HR><BR>

<FONT SIZE="2" FACE="ariel">

Many people will remember that several months ago,<BR>
news was spreading about a "Play-Nice" rule that<BR>
Verant was considering. Earlier today, I learned that<BR>
Verant has finally put a variation of these rules in effect<BR>
which involves Kill Stealing, and and Camping issues. <BR>
Before now, each GM of each server could have his<BR>
own variation of how KS'ing and camping was handled, <BR>
which means that the rules would be different on each<BR>
server. I'm not sure why an official announcment has<BR>
not been made yet, but GM's and Guides have already<BR>
been instructed to start inforcing this as of two days<BR>
ago. Any of this information may be verified by any GM<BR>
or guide: <BR><BR>

<B>Kill Stealing Policy:</B> <BR><BR>

Kill Stealing is now officially defined as Killing an NPC<BR>
or Mob for any reason, that is already attacking another<BR>
player. Any player that is caught intentionally kill<BR>
stealing by a guide or GM may now be warned. These<BR>
warnings when accumulated, can lead to the player<BR>
being suspended or banned from EverQuest by a GM. <BR><BR>

<B>Play Nice Policy: </B><BR><BR>

Spawns in the game can no longer be claimed or<BR>
controlled by a single player or group. Wether it is a<BR>
single or multiple spawn, for an item or for XP, low or<BR>
high level, all groups wishing to camp a spawn must<BR>
work out some type of rotation or means to share the<BR>
spawn. <BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Gordon's Responses in order:</FONT><BR><HR><BR>

<FONT SIZE="2" FACE="ariel"><I>
This information somehow got leaked before we were<BR>
 ready to comment on it, hence it showing up on the<BR>
 boards before we had a chance to talk to you about it. <BR><BR>

 I'll have a new Producer's Letter up early next week to<BR>
 address the new rules, how they are going to be enforced, <BR>
 and the spirit behind the letter. <BR><BR>

 -Gordon<BR><HR><BR>


EverQuest is a Multiplayer game, and as such, people<BR>
 have to interact with other people. The focus of these rules<BR>
 will be to form some guidelines for these interactions, and<BR>
 provide the GMs and Guides a course of action in the<BR>
 event that some people purposely attempt to reduce the<BR>
 amount of fun that another person can have. You all pay<BR>
 the same amount of money to play the game, and thus<BR>
 deserve the same options while here. <BR><BR>

 Ultimately, the goal is to provide some tools that allow<BR>
 people to work out situations on their own and not<BR>
 involve the GM/Guide staff who should be focused on<BR>
 adding content and dealing with real customer-service<BR>
 issues. I think that the rules, which will be outlined next<BR>
 week in the Producer's Letter, will result in more<BR>
 short-term intervention by the GM/Guide staff, but will<BR>
 empower people to solve their own problems in the long<BR>
 run. <BR><BR>

 -Gordon<BR><HR><BR>

Due to the information getting out, it has caused quite a<BR>
few problems on the servers. The GMs are attempting to<BR>
 explain that these rules will go into effect very soon (at the<BR>
 time of our official announcement), but shouldn't be<BR>
 enforcing them per se quite yet. <BR><BR>
