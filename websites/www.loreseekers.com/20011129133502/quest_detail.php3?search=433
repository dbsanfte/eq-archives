This quest results in the Medallion of the Obulus, one of the three medallions needed for the <A HREF="quest_detail.php3?search=434">Rune of Scale</A> quest to get into Veeshan's Peak. <BR><BR>

Slixin Klex is located at -682, -1121, -560. He is a level 50 skeleton and is indifferent to both good and evil races.<BR><BR>

Ask him <I>"what burning of the land?"</I>.<BR>
Slixin Klex says <I>"Fiery death from the sky.  Rock and fire burning our lands.  Death and destruction splintering our tribe.  Once strong we were but the fiery rocks from the sky crushed our proud cities and weakened our tribe."</I><BR><BR>

Ask him <I>"what tribe"</I><BR>
and Slixin Klex says <I>"Obulus was our peoples.  The hills and trees were our lands.  We tamed the dark and wilds and bent the forests to our needs.  But all is gone, all our peoples, all our works, even the medallion that was the symbol of our power.'</I><BR><BR>

Ask him <I>"what medallion"</I><BR>
and Slixin Klex says <I>"Medallion of the Obulus.  Symbol of our proud peoples. Broken into pieces long lost to the dark forests now.  I know where they are now but I am no longer flesh.  If I were I would find them to bring them back together."</I><BR><BR>

Ask him <I>"what pieces?"</I><BR>
and Slixin Klex says <I>"Hhhhh.  Three pieces there are.  One sits in the hands of Sselot though he knows its purpose not.  Another sits upon an Iksar ghost in Trakanons.  The last is held by a long rotted Iksar skeleton in the Dreadlands.  Bring them all here and I may be able to unite them again. Perhaps this will even free me from my torment… or not."</I><BR><BR>

Remember that there are three separate medallions in the game, each broken into three peices that just say a piece of broken medallion when you find it. You need to identify the piece of medallion you find to determine which one it is.<BR><BR>

These are the locations:<BR><BR>

<B>(1)  Middle Portion:</B>  Drops off a rotting skeleton at loc 2100, -5100 in the Dreadlands;<BR>
<B>(2)  Bottom Portion:</B>  Dropped by the Pained Soul in Old Sebilis;<BR>
<B>(3)  Upper Portion:</B> Dropped by Sselot Dnaas, who spawns in the island in Warslik's Woods. (Or give him a <A HREF="quest_detail.php3?search=455">Burnished Wooden Staff</A> to get it).<BR>
