	<FONT SIZE="-1">

	<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>H</B></FONT>ere I stand on the shores of the newfound continent of Kunark, overlooking the vast plain of the Overthere, with the massive statue of an Iksar towering above all.  To the west is a range of massive volcanoes, belching out smoke and ash as if Solusek himself sat beneath.  Behind me, to the east, is Warslik's Woods, a vast forest the size of both Faydarks, if not larger.  I can hear the Forest Giants rumbling and the howls of the goblins from here.  I have taken to write this missive and leave it with a friend who journeys back to Antonica.  I may return one day, but this uncharted land is ripe for exploration by the many that have arrived these last few days.

	<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>I</B></FONT> have seen many a place and learned much in my 35 years.  I am still considered to be young in Tier'dal society, but I have seen places and things that many of my race has not.  I have also met a group of individuals who encompass a set of ideals that I have come to embrace, Friendship.  This is an alien concept to most dark elves, as Tier'dal society is one that focuses on hate.  Don't get me wrong, I am still knight in the service of Innoruuk, but I have learned from my friends to focus this hate to those that truly deserve it.  I am not the only Tier'dal to do so either.  Soulree, a necromancer of immense power, has also learned to focus his hate on those who truly deserve it.  Just ask the Ogres of Oggok, as they are still rebuilding their forces from their futile battle with him.

	<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>W</B></FONT>ho could cause such a change in a dark-elven shadow knight, you ask?  It is a group of like minded explorers called the Seekers of Lore.  How did they manage to get my interest?  Exploration.  I have always had a deep seeded interest in seeing the world, and the Seekers have this same craving.

	<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>D</B></FONT>oes this mean I have become some flower-loving, tree hugging faerie?  Bah, I long ago stopped counting the number of foes I have vanquished.  The Lost Temple of Cazic Thule still smolders from my adventures there.  The fire goblins of Solusek's Eye have declared a personal war on me for slaying their king.  I have stared the Avatar of Fear in the eyes and lived to tell the tale.  I have just learned to focus my energies on those who truly deserve it.

	<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>I</B></FONT> suppose it is a bit odd that I, a Knight of the Shadow, would be willing to lay my life on the line for a High Elf cleric, a Wood Elf druid, or a Gnome wizard, but they are my friends.   Together we have slain giants, griffins, and even the dreaded necromancer Meldrath.  I look back now to when I first met the Seekers, and have only fond memories to regale.

	<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>I</B></FONT>t was a dark and dreary evening.  Lightning flashed, illuminating the forest around me.  Here I was, a Tier'dal in the Lesser Faydark.  The only darker forest I know of is the one outside my home, the Nektulos.  Ahead of me was a mountain pass, which lead to Castle Mistmoore.  Here was a supposed ally of my liege lord, Queen Cristanos Thex, Mayong Mistmoore.  I had heard that willing Tier'dal could inlist in his service and learn arcane arts and skills of battle.  Ever one to hunger for power and knowledge, I jumped at the chance.  I strode through the pass and came upon a courtyard, where two dark elf women clad in full plate greeted me.  I quickly stated my business here, and was escorted back by one who was called a pledge.  As we walked back, the pledge spoke to me of the wonder of serving Lord Mistmoore.  It sounded a bit too much like a sermon of one enslaved, as no man could be that perfect, but I shrugged it off to one young and drunk with new found power.  We passed through the courtyard, and down a long passageway carved in the rock.  Off to my right was a graveyard, tended by some other initiates.  

	<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>A</B></FONT>t the far end of the passage was a large open area, which the pledge called the Pit.  It was a training area where those who were done pledging came to train.  The ancilles they were called.  We crossed this pit, and started up a path on the far wall, and upon reaching the top, we came to the gates of Castle Mistmoore.  Here I was greeted by a butler, who asked me my business and when satisfied with my answers, took me across the drawbridge and into the castle.  I taken to an antechamber, and told to wait.  I took it upon myself to explore the room.  It looked like a library or study.  There were books from all over Norrath, from guides of gnomish tinkering to magical tomes from far off Erudin.  I was pondering as to whether or not I should open one of these tomes when a scream that sent chills up my spine, no small feat there, echoed through the castle. I shrugged it off, thinking it may be some hapless prisoner being tortured

	<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>T</B></FONT>he door opened and in walked a beautiful Tier'dal clad in a sheer robe, and a being in hooded robe who's features I could not make out.

	<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>T</B></FONT>he lady spoke first, <I>"Greetings, Nalfein.  You have traveled far to come to us, and master Viswin has instructed me to attend to your needs."</I>  

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>"I have no needs, other than to garner more knowledge"</I> I told them. <I>"I am ready to begin as soon as possible"</I>.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>"Are you?"</I> The voice from the robe could only be described as bone chilling. <I>"You think you are ready for true power?  If so, behold the power."</I>  With that, pale Tier'dal hand pulled back the hood to reveal what was once a dark elf, but now was a monster.
 
	<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>I</B></FONT> was aghast.  I now understood why no one came back from serving Lord Mistmoore.  It was not the power that they achieved; it was the power that enslaved them.  I would not be anyone's slave.  In one of my less than finer moments, I panicked.  I moved to the door, thanking them but saying that I had changed my mind.  Master Viswin smiled, and as I opened the door to find two guards blocking my way.  Now I knew my fate was to fight my way out, or die trying.  I sent waves of darkness to engulf the room, and dove and rolled past the guards, drawing Dark Reaver in the process.
 
	<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>I</B></FONT> cut down both guards, and then ran towards the entrance.  I turned the first corner to find the Tier'dal lady in front of me.  

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>"Nalfein, why do you run.  Stay with us and I will be your reward."</I>

	<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>N</B></FONT>ow here was a good offer I could stay here and have this woman any…. No, these were not my thoughts.  <I>"Get out of my head, devil woman!"</I> I drove my sword through her breast, ending her magical mind assault.

	<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>N</B></FONT>ow the way was clear, and I ran across the bridge and down the path.  I bolted through the training pit before they could react, but I heard them coming after me.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>"Stop him!"</I>  Master Viswin's shout echoed across through the passageway.

	<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>I</B></FONT> had a good head start, and if I could get back to the forest, I could easily lose them there.  I came to the graveyard and there stood four guards in chain armor.  I didn't even stop.  I ran at one, slamming him in the face with m fist, while parrying the other blows with my sword.  I would have to keep going, or I was doomed.  I ran on, with the guards in hot pursuit.  I made it to the courtyard, and headed for the pass out to the Lesser Faydark.

	<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>I</B></FONT>t was then that the very earth reached out and rooted me to the ground, halting my escape.  Damn, one of the casters had levitated down from the castle and gotten ahead of me.  The guards stopped, as being rooted did not mean that I couldn't cleave them in twain.

	<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>T</B></FONT>he ancilles gathered behind the guards, and through them strode Viswin. <I>"Escape from here is not an option.  I, Garon Viswin will personally see that your initiation is both long and painful.  You cost us a valuable asset in slaying my enchantress.  Now drop you sword and submit!"</I>

	<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>S</B></FONT>ummoning all my will, I prepared to defy this foul fiend with my last breath, when suddenly a bolt of lightning struck him, knocking him backwards.

	<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>"Prepare to meet your maker, demons!"</I>  A dwarf and human clad in full steel, paladins by the look of them, waded into the guards and ancilles.

	<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>I</B></FONT> was surrounded by a lavender glow, and the earth lost its grip on me.  Now, these cattle would feel my wrath.  I turned on the caster first, and sent him screaming, his blood boiling with the wrath of Innoruuk.  Next I waded into the group, and at my side I noticed a slender half elf ranger wielding a sword in either hand.  She danced through the familiars, cutting them down with great ease.

	<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>R</B></FONT>oots exploded out of the ground, pulling the minions down.  Firebolts flew over my head to strike down the pawns of Mistmoore by the score.  Off to my right I saw a shimmering and out of the shadows strode a black robed Tier'dal.  Only death herself had a grimmer look.  He pointed once and promptly drained the lifeforce from the nearest victim.  Here was a powerful member of the Dead, my own guild.  A hasty salute and thanks, and I strode forward.  

	<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>T</B></FONT>he paladins, Xereos and Notami, were cutting a wide berth, especially due to the fact that they wielded flaming swords.  A sickening thud was all that was heard as the High Elf priestess brained another pledge.  It seemed even the mighty Fier'dal could enjoy some bloodshed.

	<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>A</B></FONT>cross her shoulder, I saw Master Viswin advancing on the slender cleric.  His eyes focused on her with a glare that would chill a sand giant's blood. I strode forward, and stepped right in front of Viswin.  Why would I do this?  The cleric was the one who had freed me from my earthen prison, and that was enough for me. Viswin pulled up short when I stepped in front of him, obviously so engrossed in the cleric, he had not seen me coming.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>"Innoruuk awaits you, fiend,"</I> I told him, as I laid my hand upon his chest and bestowed upon him my greatest gift, the Harm Touch.

	<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>M</B></FONT>aster Viswin's scream was one of someone who had truly believed they were immortal.  Alas for him, all those slain by the touch are sent to the halls of Innoruuk for his personal attentions.

	<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>T</B></FONT>his cracked what little moral the minions had left, and they turned and ran.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>"We must go before they return with reinforcements, or even worse, Lord Mistmoore."</I>  The gnome wizard, Shahk, said.

	<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>T</B></FONT>he druid, a wood elf with hair the color of Solusek's Eye, turned to the dwarf and whispered in his ear.  <I>"Felenya here says that you helped protect Khathryne, and Soulree here has heard of you in your guild circle."</I>

	<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>H</B></FONT>e pulled out a scroll and tossed it my way. <I>"Here be a summons to join us.  Come to our guildhall in North Freeport and we will talk."</I>

	<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>I</B></FONT> was a bit puzzled, a paladin offering an invite to a shadow knight, but the necromancer stood with them, so this bunch intrigued me.  I took the note, gave a salute, and stepped into the shadows as they teleported to one of the many wizard gates that dotted the lands.  With that, I ran off into the forest, and began my journey back to Antonica.

	<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>A</B></FONT> fortnight later, I stepped off the boat on the docks of Freeport, and headed towards the northern quarter.  I stopped at one of the seedier taverns in the city, and talked to a contact.  He told me that the Seekers were known for their hunger for knowledge, and that they often went on long quests to far off places.  Here is what I had struck out to find.  I made my way through the city, avoiding the guards who would undoubtedly stop a Tier'dal of any sorts.  I made my way to the guildhall and it seemed they knew I was coming.  Before I could even knock, Soulree and the lady Khathryne greeted me at the door.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>"Come in dark brother, and let us talk of things to come."</I>

	<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>M</B></FONT>any, many hours later, I left, the only difference, a medallion around my neck, and new friends at my side.  Where we were going is a tale for another time.
