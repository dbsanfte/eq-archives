This is a fairly high level quest.  Start the quest by talking to Lovehill in the necro guild in Neriak after completing the Sir Lindeals's quest. <BR><BR>

You have to take a note to Kizdon Gix in West Commons. After you find him there, Gix tells you to get the 3 pieces of the mallet and give it back to Lovehill and to give another note to his old apprentice Lrodd. The phrase you utter to Kizdean Gix to get the note for Lrodd is "utalk adarev otcin".  Well he is dead, but he can be found in level 1 of Befallen.<BR><BR>

Skeleton Lrodd tells you that to get the mallet you need to seek Windstream (level 20+ Zombie). The best way to find and kill Windstream is with two people. When one person hands the note from Gix to Lrodd, Windstream will spawn instantly down on the 3rd level. That is when the second person should grab him. Windstream has the Stem of the mallet, and this piece is a container. The first 2 pieces (Head and Hilt) come from killing Elf Skeletons. Take the Head and Hilt and combine them in the Stem you got from Windstream and you will make a <A HREF="http://www.loreseekers.com/weapon_detail.php3?search=131 ">Thex Mallet</A>.<BR><BR>

If you return the mallet to Lovehill and your faction is very high with him (at least amiable), you may occasionally get a <A HREF="http://www.loreseekers.com/armor_detail.php3?search=220">Ring of the Dead</A>.  You also might get the <A HREF="http://www.loreseekers.com/weapon_detail.php3?search=266">Reaper of the Dead</A> or the <A HREF="http://www.loreseekers.com/weapon_detail.php3?search=371">Bone Handled Sword</A>.<BR><BR>
