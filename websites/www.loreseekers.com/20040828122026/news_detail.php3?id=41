What this means is that on each of the different servers that the Seekers of Lore are on, there is now a separate leader there, who has complete control over that server. 
Thanks to Sorontar, they now also have full administration use of the website to process applications and administer their members. If anyone wishes to talk to the leader of their own server, they can email them by the links in their membership profiles on this site. 
Below is a finalized list of each server, and the new leaders of them…<BR><BR>
1. Tarew Marr:	Sorontar <BR>
2. Tallon Zek:	Lovechant <BR>
3. Bristlebane:	Palakin <BR>
4. Bertoxxulous: Shahk <BR>
5. Cazic-Thule: Valoric <BR>
6: Innoruuk:	Arcae <BR>
7. Quellious:	Kellinden <BR>
8. Rodcet Nife:	Natik <BR>
9. The Rathe:	Maldian <BR>
10. Tunare:	Zaphar <BR>
11. Veeshan: 	Pikapa <BR>
12. Xegony:	Kiwi <BR><BR>
I have also requested from Verant, that Sorontar take over from me as the main holder of this Guild Charter and be given the authority to set up on new servers. So hopefully , the Seekers of Lore will once again be expanding to new territory in a little while. Let me also take this time to say a formal goodbye to all members, as this is my final official action for the guild. It has been a great pleasure to start this guild and to meet all the great members. I am looking towards Vernat's next big MMP game, Sovereign, and have started work on a website for it. Who Knows? I may start a 'Clan' for that game! ;-)<BR><BR>
