<TABLE CELLSPACING = 0 CELLPADDING = 0 BORDER = 0>
<TR><TD>This is apparantly the quest to get the components for the Wizard
Spell Ice Comet.  Details are still very sketchy. There are 3 npc's standing along ice wall near
Starn bearjumpers place.   Talk with the human wizard Sulgar and he will tell you that he is
looking for tartons wheel.  He gives you a glowing case and a <A HREF="http://www.loreseekers.com/books.php3">"Tome of the Wheel"</A>, containing  hints that span all over
the 3 continents. The case is to hold the spokes of the wheel and the tome gives you hints on
where to find the pieces.  Tartons wheel apprently lets you travel through the planes. 
Appearently you combine the pieces you find in the box and get "the staff of the wheel and the
star of eyes."  When you give it to him, he will give you the runes of frost and astral needed to
research the ice comet spell.   There are 10 pieces that you need scattered across the face of
Norrath. The names of the 10 spokes are: Azia, Beza, Caza, Dena, Ena, Fana, Geza, Heda,
Izah, Jaka.  The locations I know are as follows:  (1) [beza] In the underwater cave in the
Everfrost plains;  (2) In the Qeynos aquaducts near the sharks; (3)  In Eruds Crossing where
the zombie sailors hang out.<BR><BR>
<B>Complete Quest Update</B> - Submitted by Shaidar<BR><BR>
Here are the rod locations for the ice comet quest, which begins by talking to Sulgar in Everfrost. Once you have the rods you go to him and ask him for the chest which you need to combine the rods. Upon a successful combining of the rods (which is hard, I failed 3 out of 5 times), you make 2 items, one is the staff of the wheel (see stats below) the other is the star of eyes (see stats below) which you can either keep or give to him for the runes.<BR><BR>
Anyhow the locations are as follows,<BR>
<B>1. Azia</B> - Is correct in Eruds crossing on the deep part of the ocean floor past the boat, location -1162 pos 2340<BR><BR>
<B>2. Beza</B> - Correct in the underwater caves, it is in the "house" all the way back and right in the cave, where 3 dry bones guard it in the center of the room.<BR><BR>
<B>3. Caza</B> - Lake rathe, Underneath the first island you see is an underwater tunnel leading to a stone tower, it's on the top floor of the tower (need enduring breath for this one)<BR><BR>
<B>4. Dena</B> - Dagnor's cauldron, right outside the entrance to kedge, if you face with your back to kedge, is directly diagonal left, in a corner.<BR><BR>
<B>5. Ena</B> - Lower Gukk in the Reanimated hand room. This one is the only one you need a group for, unless your brave and kamakazi it. Warning the floor is the same color as the rod in this room and it makes it very hard to find with the hand and the dar beating on you.<BR><BR>
<B>6. Fana</B> - Oasis is correct but the tower is underwater next to the above ground tower, this one is on the top floor of the tower as well.<BR><BR>
<B>7. Geza</B> - HH pass is correct, it's in the water near the waterfall closest to the Tiger Inn, there are 2 waterfalls there, rod is in front of the one closest to the inn.<BR><BR>
<B>8. Heda</B> - Erudin is Wrong, it is Qeynos Aquceducts, in the shark pit there.<BR><BR>
<B>9. Izah</B> - Neriak is correct, but its in the water in front of the bar called "the blind fish", the bar has 4 glass windows that are underwater, and the rod spawns right in front of those windows.<BR><BR>
<B>10. Jaka</B> - Its in unrest but not near a mob that drops dwarven armor, its in the water outside the right side of the house near where the gnome spelunker is, instead of going into the tunnel that leads to him, you go a little right of that entrance and there's a very short passage, there lies the rod.<BR><BR>
I hope this helps, its 100% accurate, if you don't believe me I can show you my staff of the wheel:)<BR><BR>
Also I would like to add that the rods only spawn after server resets, and they are no drop so once some newbie picks em up, they are gone till a server reset.<BR><BR>
Also out of 5 times I failed on combining the rods 3 times. The runes of frost and astral are no drop from the quest as is the scroll they make. Also the rune of astral does not work with the rune of impetus if you wanted to use it for the other lvl 49 spell you can make astral.<BR><BR>
Stats on Staff of the Wheel is 10 DMG, 100 DLY, 10 INT, 10 HP, 10 Mana, 1H Blunt, WIZ only. Star of eyes is a jewel that can cast unlimited identify spell.<BR><BR></TD></TR>
