			<P>As with the brewing Guide, this was also written with the intent of being made for my guild,        so any specific information I might have over looked in editing for you, please ignore.</P>
			<P> </P>
			<P>To begin with, let me point out this guide will in no way, be complete. I’ve found nothing to take my skill completely to Master and am currently at skill level 82 at this point. I’ll continue to experiment with various items until the Mixing bowl is completed and Dough is makeable. (<B>Editors Note</B>: Dough is now makeable and the recipe is an EGG (such as a snake egg), FLOUR, and MILK, combined in the MIXING BOWL. It becomes trivial around level 20)</P>
			<P> </P>
			<P>The information here will allow for individuals to determine another manner for making money without leaving a city. This is in no way meant to discourage individuals from exploring the world of Norrath, but will allow for a safe manner of earning your weekly pay.</P>
			<P> </P>
			<P>As noted prior on Skill requirements, the prime stats are INT, WIS, DEX, CHAR for most trade skills. Dex does not seem to play any part in baking, but I will add it just in case I am missing something.</P>

			<P>Lastly, a simplified Formula that was supplied by Hugo the Halfling Chef to Allakhazam’s site as well:</P>
			<P> </P>
			<I><P>*Also skewers, pots, pie tins, smokers </P>

			<I><P>*Oven and spit are interchangeable, but with different sizes of meats or type of food sometimes.   Only one may be used according to the recipe books.</P>
			</I><P> </P>
			<P>All in all, this listing is correct with a few minor differences. Such as Gnome Kabob’s are not made per the "Cannibalistic treats" but instead per the Kabobs listing. Subtle differences, but differences none the less. Just make sure to read the Name of the meal and you should have little to no problems.</P>
			<P> </P>
			</FONT><B><P>Now onto the Actual Guide</B><FONT SIZE=2>.</P>
			<P> </P>
			<P>To start with, it’s suggested that you invest at least 5-10 points into the baking skill from training points, but is not needed. I had invested none upon starting this trade skill.</P>
			<P> </P>
			<P>The easiest to make item, is amazingly the least wanted item. Edible Goo. Edible Goo is an item that looks something like fishing grubs. And, from the ingredients needed, isn’t far off. To make your first batch of Edible Goo, go into any forest, and collect fire beetle eyes. As these are not stackable items, it is best to carry several empty backpacks for this. Completely fill your inventory with the exception of one slot and go to a Rat infested area, I had to make a trip to Freeport as this is not an animal that is indigenous to Nektulos forest. Giant Rats and large rats drop "rat ears". Collect as many ears as you have Fire beetle eyes. If the area you are hunting in is far from a "friendly" town, collect multiple stacks of Ears so that you needn’t make very many trips.</P>
			<P> </P>
			<P>*<B>Note: While collecting Rat ears, I would suggest keeping any Rat Meat you find for later usage unless you are strapped for room in your inventory. If you have ample room to carry 20 Fire beetle eyes, with extra slots open, then please do so to prevent un-needed trips later</B>*</P>
			<P> </P>
			<P>After collecting a satisfactory amount of items, find your local oven. In Neriak, there are two in the Foreign Quarters and one in the commons near the bank. Go to the oven and left click on it. This will open a container for the oven. Place:</P>
			<P> </P>
			<P>1 Fire beetle eye</P>
			<P>1 Rat ear</P>
			<P>Hit combine.</P>
			<P> </P>
			<P>Upon success, you will create 1 item of Edible Goo. Place this into an empty slot and continue with this process until your inventory is completely empty of Fire beetle eyes and Rat ears. Edible go will continue to raise your skill to roughly 20. I did not actually keep track of the max levels for the items in baking, I apologize for not giving specifics this time. But, with the need to make several zoning trips to collect items, it was rather tedious.</P>
			<P> </P>
			<B><P>Note: Edible Goo lasts for a remarkably long time. The theory is based off the comment on Edible Goo in the baking instructions. It states:</P>
			</B><P> </P>
			<B><I><U><P>"Cooking Instructions:</P>
			</I></U><P>Choose a random temperature and set the spit or oven to it. Mash the Flame Beetle eyes with stones until pureed. Add rate ears. Leave on heat until you gain the strength to consume the mixture."</P>
			</B><P> </P>
			<P>Thus, the fact that it takes a considerable amount of will power or desperation to make you eat it, it last far longer than normal store bought items, with the exception of Iron Rations.</P>
			<P> </P>
			<P>After reaching skill level of 20 (or when Edible Goo becomes Trivial), you will need to progress to something harder. At this point, I suggest another trip.</P>
			<P> </P>
			<P>You will need to locate another steady supply of animals. In this case Bats. Again, I had to go to Freeport once more as Bats are also not indigenous to Nektulos. This time, collect as many Bat wings as you can. I personally gave several newbies 2pp for every stack of 20 bat wings, so I could not truly estimate the value of this trade skill. I also ran two newbies through "player sponsored quests" that I will go into more detail on later. While collecting these items, it is also suggested to collect Spider legs. I personally took the time and collected 4 stacks of 20 bat wings before returning to Neriak to continue my practices.</P>
			<P> </P>
			<P>*<B>Note: Spider Legs are different than spiderling legs. A Spider Leg is stackable, and thus easily differentiated from spiderling legs, which are not. You will need the stackable version</B>*</P>
			<P> </P>
			<P>Upon returning to your Oven, there should be a Merchant nearby that will sell Frosting. In Neriak, only the Baker near the bank sells this item that I have found.</P>
			<P> </P>
			<P>Now that you have a sufficient supply of Bat wings, you will need to purchase a like amount of Frosting. If you have spent several nights collecting bat wings as I, and have 40, purchase 40 units of frosting. Open the oven, as above, and place within it:</P>
			<P> </P>
			<P>1 Bat wing</P>
			<P>1 Frosting</P>
			<P>Hit combine.</P>
			<P> </P>
			<P>Success here will create Batwing Crunchies. This item is not as long lived as the Edible Goo, but much more satisfying to the stomach. 1 Unit will be created as per the Edible Goo. Place this in your inventory and continue with the next combination. If you have collected any Spider legs during your venture out for batwings, use the same formula:</P>
			<P> </P>
			<P>1 Spider Leg</P>
			<P>1 Frosting</P>
			<P>Hit combine</P>
			<P> </P>
			<P>	This will create 1 Woolie Spider Crunchies. Another rather tasty treat that settles far better than Edible Goo on my rather picky appetite.</P>
			<P> </P>
			<P>	Continue this process until you are out of Bat wings, Spider Legs, and Frostings. I was well into skill range of 30 by my second batch of these. The hardest part is the tedious trip between Neriak and Freeport in order to collect the ingredients. It was at this point, the "crunchie" line of items became trivial. I estimate this was around skill 35 or so but cannot guarantee as I was working on various items at this point to determine what had the best results upon success.</P>
			<P> </P>
			<P>	By skill level 30, you can now also begin on something slightly harder, and more fulfilling. Provided you took my suggestion and kept the Rat meat you were storing, you can begin on another item.</P>
			<P> </P>
			<P>	This can be done in one of two ways, but you will still not have very many successes either way.</P>
			<P> </P>
			<B><I><P>Beer Braised Rat Steaks:</P>
			</B></I><P> </P>
			<P>	To create this item, go to the local bar, in Neriak there are two near the bank. In the foreign Quarter there are several all right together near the oven, as well as in the Ogre/Troll side of town. Purchase a number of <B>Short Beers</B> equal to the Rat meat you own. Return to the individual selling frosting and purchase spice. Buy a like number of <B>Spices</B> as you own Rat meat and Short beers. Now, return to the oven, open it as normal, and place:</P>
			<P> </P>
			<P>1 Rat Meat</P>
			<P>1 Short Beer</P>
			<P>1 Spice</P>
			<P>Hit combine.</P>
			<P> </P>
			<P>Upon success, you will create one Beer Braised Rat steaks. Place these in inventory and continue until you are out of Rat Meat, Spices, and Short Beer.</P>
			<P> </P>
			<P>*<B>Note: This formula can also be used with Wolf Meat, Bear Meat, Alligator Meat, and  Lion Meat, but CANNOT be used with a Chunk of Meat. Also, with Wolf, Bear, Alligator, and Lion meat, you will create TWO Units instead of one.</B>*</P>
			<P> </P>
			<B><I><P>Rat Steaks:</P>
			</B></I><P> </P>
			<P>	To create this item, go to the vendor with Frosting, purchase as many <B>Jugs of Sauce</B> and <B>Spices</B> as you have Rat Meat. Return to the Oven and open as normal. Place:</P>
			<P> </P>
			<P>1 Rat Meat</P>
			<P>1 Spices</P>
			<P>1 Jug of Sauce</P>
			<P>Hit Combine</P>
			<P> </P>
			<P>	Success will result in one Rat Steak. Place in your inventory and repeat process until all units of Rat Meat, Spices, and Jugs of Sauce are depleted.</P>
			<P> </P>
			<P>*<B>Note: This formula can also be used with Wolf Meat, Bear Meat, Alligator Meat, and  Lion Meat, but CANNOT be used with a Chunk of Meat</B>*</P>
			<P> </P>
			<P>Both of the above appears to become trivial about Skill level 50. Regardless of the item being Trivial, you will still have some failures.</P>
			<P> </P>
			<P>	Now that even the steaks were trivial to me, I had to seek something new to test my skills on. At this point, I decided to throw myself back into a profession I have not used since Level 3, Fishing. For those of you whom have continued your practices of this monotonous art, I offer my salute. I personally cannot find it worth the hassle of sitting upon the peer fishing while I know there are many lands I have not seen still. This was of course, my down fall. It was during the 30 minutes of sitting upon the docks watching my skill at fishing sky rocket to the mere range of 30, that I wondered how my successes would be had I continued this profession for the last 16 levels. I was, however determined and despite the pleas of my comrades in arms to leave the murky waters of Neriak and explore the depths of another land, I would not budge from that wooden pillar that served as my throne as I glared down at Prexus’s domain. Sadly, the monotony got to me, and I pondered how difficult it would be to simply slay a shark, summon it back from death’s domain to serve me. Ordering it to simply devour all fish within the bay that I could cut open it’s belly and have all the fish I needed. After a few minutes of wondering exactly what would happen had there been a shark within the shallow waters of Neriak’s waters, I decided 20 fish was enough to experiment and went to sell off the excess items I had pulled into my bucket. With the number of Shoes and daggers I pulled into my bucket, it would not surprise me that there had indeed been a shark about the waters. At the Vendor whom sold me the fishing pole, I noticed fish were for sale at the mere price of 3sp. I decided to purchase these that I could experiment longer, and I dare say I didn’t want to sit for anther 30 minutes toss a worm into water. I bought 3 sets of 20 fish giving me a total of 80 total fish with which to practice. So, I went back to the bakers and bought a like amount of Jugs of Sauce (These cost roughly 1sp 2cp with my charisma). Once more, I went to my favorite oven, centrally located to the bank, and all supplies to fill my current needs. Open the Oven and place:</P>
			<P> </P>
			<P>1 Fish</P>
			<P>1 Jugs of Sauce</P>
			<P>Hit combine.</P>
			<P> </P>
			<P>	Success here will result in <B><U>TWO </B></U>Fish Fillet’s. Continue until you are out of Fish and Jugs of Sauce. This is were I learned something rather interesting, and this is where fishing becomes rather profitable. I WILL be taking up this profession once more soon. Upon selling these items, they sell for 5sp 2cp. This is not all that special unto itself, but when you stop to look at the fact I can buy both items for 4sp 2cp total, and they create <B><U>TWO</B></U> units upon success, the price starts adding up. Every success, you gain money. I wasn’t succeeding all that often, but my skill had gone up considerably. After two runs of this type, buying 80 Fish and 80 Jugs of Sauce, my skill maxed out a Skill level 82 where this item became trivial for me. The item was successful roughly 75% of the time after skill level 70.</P>
			<P> </P>
			<P>	Now to look at why this is profitable if you haven’t already noticed. Every 20 units I sold, would return me 1pp and small change. In relation to brewing, 20 Units of Ol’Tujim’s fierce brew sold for 8gp and change. 20 Fish Fillet’s sold for 1pp and small change. IF you build your fishing skill up, and take the time to catch all 80 Fish you are only needing to purchase the Jugs of Sauce at 1sp 2cp. At high skill levels I’m told this isn’t difficult to catch this many fish, plus the money you make off Rusty Daggers, Sandles, and Fish scales can be used to purchase the Bait needed. If you catch all 80 fish yourself, using the Sandles, Daggers, and fish scales to fund the bait as stated before, the cost to make these items is 4gp 8sp. Assuming you are successful only 50% of the time, you will still create 80 units which equates out to 4pp 8cp using my Charisma of 65. On the hypothetical chance you are successful 100% of the time, I’ve done this ONCE with Ol’Tujim’s Fierce Brew, you will earn 8pp 1sp 6cp from spending 4gp 8cp. Now, don’t get me wrong, It’s very unlikely you will ever receive 100% success rates, but even with only 50% success rates, you can make money fairly easily at this rate. Purchasing all the components instead of fishing for them, I effectively double my money. With higher Charisma, the profits will be far greater, and the initial cost will be less.</P>
			<P> </P>
			<P>	Now that your appetites are watering, let me point out two things. Unlike most skills, fishing is considered a "Trade Skill" <B><U>BUT</B></U> is still limited by Level. So don’t expect to become a Master Fisherman at level 1. And secondly, fishing is monotonous, tedious, expensive at early levels If you continue to break the fishing rod, but is still safe with only the threat of drowning being a worry for new players. This said, I hope you all enjoy the rather lengthy description of what good fishing is.</P>
			<P> </P>
			<P>	Aside from being a rather good way to earn money, it is also a very good way to create food instead of having to purchase food. At early levels, when killing beetles and Rats is the only way to level and gain money, you can save your coppers and make your own food. Edible Goo does sell for roughly 3sp.</P>
			<P> </P>
			<P>	As noted at the very beginning of this guide, I have not found any items that will take my skill up beyond 82. It is believed, that without the ability to make Dough, this is the max skill obtainable (<B>Editors Note</B>: Dough is now makeable and the recipe is an EGG (such as a snake egg), FLOUR, and MILK, combined in the MIXING BOWL. It becomes trivial around level 20). I will test a theory of mine today. I will be working on this today and will send out a completed email with that data on it if it does indeed bring my skill beyond the current point. Until then, or my next Trade Skill guide, good brewing and fishing. And on a more personal note, please feel free to donate money to myself whenever you want that I can continue my experiments and my guides to Trade skills. (Hey, I had to throw in at least ONE shameless plug in a trade skill ya know!) </P>
