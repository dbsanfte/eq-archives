Note that this quest is needed to finish the <A HREF="quest_detail.php3?search=139">Trueshot Longbow quest</A> in Kelethin.<BR><BR>

A Dwarf named Dindaek Everhot is near the Kaladim bank and walks up and down the mine hallways very quickly will talk to you if you hail him a few times. He tells you he's in a hurry with working on his Dwarven Wire. When you ask about the wire, he tells you he'll give you some if you get him two Tumpy Tonics from Tumpy Irontoe.<BR><BR>

Trumpy can be found at a building in Kaladim on the right just before the hallway where you zone to the bank; it's right across from Tanned Assets. (there is also a Trumpy Irontoe in Qeynos who supposedly can fulfill this quest). There is no identifying sign on the door or anything, but when you walk in you'll see him standing behind a counter.<BR><BR>

Hail him and he'll say "....if you don't see something, ask me and perhaps I can make it" or something to that effect.<BR><BR>

Ask him, "Make me a Tumpy Tonic?" and he'll tell you that he can make them, but that he needs kiola nuts and flasks of water, and that Kiola nuts can be found in the island chain in the Sea of Tears. After much asking about, you find that the island you need to visit is the Island of the Sisterhood of Eollisi. When you get there, find the vendor that sells kiola nuts, purchase your Kiola nuts, and go back to Kaladim. Be VERY careful if you are going to fight anybody here, everybody is strong!<BR><BR>

In Kaladim, give Tumpy the nuts and flasks of water and he'll give you Tumpy Tonics. Take the Tumpy Tonics back down to the Dwarf Everhot, give them to him, and he'll give you a spool of dwarven wire. The wire can be used for the Trueshot Longbow quest.<BR><BR>
