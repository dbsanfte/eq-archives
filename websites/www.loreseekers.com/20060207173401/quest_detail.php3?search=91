<TR><TD>One of Hukulks chief lieutenants in
Nightkeep wants you to prove your worth by hunting the hated Ogre Greenblood
Shadowknights.  For every Black Shadow Cloak you return, he says he will
open the coffers of nightkeep and pay you a reward.  However, nobody seems
to know where you find these Ogres.<BR><BR>
Update by <B>Kegas</B><BR><BR>
This quest is given by a Troll Shadowknight trainer. He asks that you bring him a Greenblood ShadowKnight Tunic and he will give you an item in return. Unless there is an NPC wandering the Feerott, this quest seems impossible on any server but Rallos Zek, because I know of no such NPC.<BR><BR>
What I did was got the ShadowKnight Tunics myself, creating 3 ogre shadowknights, having them each do the quest, then giving the tunics over. Why 3? Because when you give him one he says he changes his mind and wants 3, plus 2 gold guild tax. All 3 tunics don't have to be given at once, you can give him the first one and then get the other two if you want. In return i was rather disappointed. You seem to get a little money and a random item of medium quality.<BR><BR>
I got a Bronze Main Gauche. I don't recommend doing this quest, it's as and time consuming as the Trueshot Bow quest, with only a slight improvement on the product.<BR><BR></TD></TR>
