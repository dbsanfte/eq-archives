<FONT COLOR="##008040" SIZE=2>
Last night Verant held a social at a local Milwaukee bar,<BR>
Bucky Bradleys. Yes, there was free food and drinks,<BR>
however, there was also easy access to three of the four<BR>
persons I most wanted to ask questions of. The only one<BR>
missing was Mr. Zatkin.<BR><BR>
From 7pm to 10:30pm we deluged Verant bigwigs with<BR>
questions concerning EQ. To our astonishment and<BR>
pleasant surprise we were given direct, concise answers<BR>
to all questions. These guys even did it with a twinkle in<BR>
their eyes. Personally I was very impresses with how<BR>
they handled themselves. There were approximately 100<BR>
to 125 players there all wanting to bend Verant's ear. I<BR>
think no one was disappointed.<BR><BR>

Of course there was a machine gun type atmosphere of<BR>
questioning. Here is what I found out.<BR><BR>

* Camping is a major priority with Verant at this time.<BR>
Smedley's thought is the world is overcrowded. He leans<BR>
towards making similar items available in other areas. An<BR>
example of this would be Jboots (call them Tboots for<BR>
travelers boots) and put them somewhere other than<BR>
Najena. Much is in the works here.<BR>
* When told that we maxed our characters in under 30<BR>
days /played time Smedley suddenly was Very<BR>
interested in us and queried us on how. He called us the<BR>
Milwaukee guard killers and said to pay attention to them<BR>
after the next patch. (and started dialing his cellphone :-()<BR>
* Plane of Fear (PoF). Why is the God CT was such a<BR>
wimp. Smedley told us to drink to our characters tonight<BR>
because in a week, upon entering the PoF they would not<BR>
be around. * Smedley said the 16hour respawn time was<BR>
due to the economics of high level items in the game. (He<BR>
thinks the PoF is WAY too easy) * Smedley said the<BR>
penalty levels (divisible by 5 levels) was an uncontrollable<BR>
error and was unavoidable.<BR>
* Smedley said that the Shaman was one of the most<BR>
difficult classes to balance. He also stated that they were<BR>
going to get an entertaining revamp to their much nerfed<BR>
disease spells.<BR>
* Smedley said the tracking screen probably will never<BR>
get a scrollbar and yes, Druids only get track to 20%<BR>
skill.<BR>
* McQuaid said that outdoor shrink was not going to be<BR>
implemented because he thinks shrunken PCs outdoors<BR>
look terrible.<BR>
* McQuaid said that personal gate was probably going to<BR>
be removed as a way out of the PoF. <BR>
* McQuaid hinted at there not being ANY way out of the<BR>
PoF in the future other than a Zone line he himself places<BR>
in there. <BR>
* McQuaid said he is considering putting a 200 to 400HP<BR>
damage effect just from zoning into the PoF. <BR>
* McQuaid smiled mischievously when we asked if the<BR>
portal out was in the Temple in PoF. He said the Hate<BR>
plane opening is not yet on the schedule.<BR>
* McQuaid is disappointed at how the ranger turned out.<BR>
He wanted him to be the master of Dual Wield.<BR>
* McQuaid said there wouldn't be an Improved Spirit of<BR>
the Wolf. He thinks the world is too small already.<BR>
* McQuaid said they forgot to place the shield icon on the<BR>
Barbarian class (WHOOPS) and that it is a 10meg library<BR>
file that controls that so no fix soon.<BR>
* McQuaid said he wanted warriors to be jazzed up just a<BR>
bit more. Perhaps weapon specialization....<BR>
* McQuaid said there is a marked difference in<BR>
experience required according to class and race. He also<BR>
said that they would not give out formulas and to question<BR>
what the rumor mill says about this. Obviously, there is a<BR>
huge spreadsheet somewhere detailing class experience<BR>
charts and penalties.<BR>
* Butler said there is no correlation between Charisma<BR>
and one's saves. Your charisma is related to how well<BR>
you interact/affect creatures. He also mentioned that<BR>
Bard's singing skill has a check against charisma. <BR>
* Bulter gave me a 20 minute history of the Guide<BR>
program. He explained what Verant's position and<BR>
policies on exploiting were and that there have been quite<BR>
a high number of banned players. The golden rule here is<BR>
that if you are decreasing another player's enjoyment of<BR>
the game you are going to be in trouble. If you do same<BR>
to multiple players you will be starting over.<BR><BR>
As you can see there is a ton of information here.<BR>
Unfortunately a bar atmosphere is not the most<BR>
conducive for question/answer. However, I think we did<BR>
fairly well. Thank you Verant!<BR><BR>
