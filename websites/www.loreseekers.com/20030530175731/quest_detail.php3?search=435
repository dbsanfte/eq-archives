This quest results in the Medallion of the Kylong, which is one of three medallions needed for the <A HREF="quest_detail.php3?search=434">Rune of Scale</A> Quest to get into Veeshan's Peak.<BR><BR>

In the Lake of Ill Omen there's a tower with some things spinning around it. It's odd and tall, not too hard to find. Inside of that tower, there's an Erudite standing in there cons red to a 49 and is indifferent. His name is Professor Akabao, and here's what he says...<BR><BR>

You say, <I>"Hail Professor Akabao".</I><BR>
Professor Akabao says <I>"Salutations traveler I dont get many visitors in these isolated regions. Have you come to learn of the ancient tribes of the Iksar?"</I><BR><BR>

You say, <I>"I have come to learn of the ancient tribes of the iksar".</I><BR>
Professor Akabao says <I>"There were five tribes of Iksars that rose from the ashes of the Shissar Empire and founded their kingdoms on the continent of Kunark. Three of the tribes were extinguished many years later by the Kunzar tribe which is the tribe that the current Iksar are descendant from. I focus my studies on learning of the extinct tribe of Kylong."</I><BR><BR>

You say, <I>"Who are the kylong?"</I>.<BR>
Professor Akabao says <I>"The Kylong were a mountain dwelling tribe of Iksar that strove for esoteric knowledge. They had vast libraries of ancient magical tomes that had been acquired from the Shissar sorcerers, and strove to understand and put the rituals documented in the tomes to practical use. When the Kunzar armies marched upon the Kylong, the three greatest Kylong mystics shattered the Medallion of Kylong, a holy relic of their tribe and fled their mountain homes in order to prevent the Kunzar from reassembling the Medallion of Kylong."</I><BR><BR>

You say, <I>"Where is the medallion"</I>.<BR>
Professor Akabao says <I>"I have been attempting to learn of the destinations of the three Kylong leaders that held the fragments of the medallion. I know only that they sought shelters to hide and continue the practice of their mystical arts In order to one day return their tribe to it's former glory. Their remains may exist beneath some of the fortresses that are centers of Iksar and Sarnak necromancy. I have seen indications that some of the tomes within those fortresses are in fact the very tomes once cherished by the Kylong. Should you manage to recover the broken pieces of the Medallion of Kylong brIng them to me so that I may restore the ancient artifact."</I><BR><BR>

Remember that there are three separate medallions in the game, each broken into three peices that just say a piece of broken medallion when you find it. You need to identify the piece of medallion you find to determine which one it is. These are the locations:<BR><BR>

<B>(1)  Middle Portion:</B>  Dropped by a Bloodgill Marauder (rare spawn) in the Lake of Ill Omen and/or on Verix Kyloxs in Karnor's Castle.<BR>
<B>(2)  Bottom Portion:</B>  Found in the library in Kaesora.<BR>
<B>(3)  Upper Portion:</B> Obtained from a RatMan named Niblek in a Chardok <A HREF="quest_detail.php3?search=438">Quest</A>.<BR><BR>
