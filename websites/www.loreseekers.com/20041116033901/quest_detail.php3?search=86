<TR><TD><B>Note:</B> This quest is a required element to complete the <A HREF="http://www.loreseekers.com/quest_detail.php3?search=87">Zimels' Blades</A> quest for Soulfire, the holy paladin sword. This quest is given by Merko, in the Hall of Truth. The
first thing Merko asks you for is to help Altunic Jartin in the E. Commons.
Take him the letter, and he will ask you to help him with a thief named
Squire Narl.  See the Squire Narl quest in E Commonlands.  This will get you
a token of generosity.  After you give him the token, Merko will ask you to
get him a spider venom sack.  Give him one and you will get a token of
bravery along with some experience anf faction. He will then tell you to
give him both if you want to go further on. Give him both tokens and he will
ask you to take the test of truth, which is killing the guard that appears
in the sewers. The guard is actually a female militia spy. Kill her quick or
she will run to the zone and be gone. If you kill her and take the token she
has to Merko, you will recive the Testimony of Truth, proclaiming you are a 
Knight of Truth. Throughout this quest, you will recieve many good faction
hits for the Knights of Truth, and the Clerics of Erolissi and a lot of
negative hits for the militia. Most people are KOS to the militia after
killing the spy, so be aware of the consequenses of your actions.
