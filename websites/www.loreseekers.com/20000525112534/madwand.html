		"Tuesday the 24th, was a sad, yet joyous day for the Seekers. 
		Tomas/Madwand decided to delete his characters on EQ and stop playing, most 
		likely forever. All of us present tried to change his mind, but to no avail. 
		He gave a lot of his equipment to other Seekers and sold the rest to pay off 
		debts with Patriquin. Yet before he left, he put Sorontar in charge of the 
		guild. We all wish you well, Madwand.

			Fortunately MadWand is not gone completely, together with me (Sorontar) we are continueing to 
			develop loreseekers.com. Who knows, when the expansion ships he might consider playing again.<BR>
			For now, we are having a lot of fun seeing this site and the guild grow.<BR>
