<FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="#00478E"><B>Jason:</B> Previously you talked about a big trade
skill patch.<BR><BR>
<B>Brad:</B> It turned out that there isn't going to be one
huge gigantic trade patch. It's happening in bits
and pieces. We did the jewelry patch which
people seem to be happy with. Right now the
trade skills game designer is focusing on make
poison for the rogue. We've already finished apply
poison but since we have no poison to apply it's
not on yet. He is doing amazing amounts of
research on poison, in fact he came into my office
the other day telling me about this plant back
east that is like 80 percent cyanide. And once he
is done with that, he'll probably go on to
blacksmithing or tailoring. Again it's a constant
process, how many things can a Blacksmith
make? .<BR><BR>
<B>Jason:</B> Is there pretty much just one guy that is
working on the trade skills? .<BR><BR>
<B>Brad:</B> There is one game designer that is
ultimately responsible for Trade skills but he
absolutely has to interact with the others. Let's
say he wants to make a new type of smithable
armor, he now has to go over and talk with the
game designer that is in charge of Items and sit
down to work it out- the name, the balance of the
items etc. It's a situation where people interact
quite a bit, but there are set responsibilities.<BR><BR>
<B>Jason:</B> Do you think every skill is going to get a
look at eventually? For instance Alchemy is
working but the potions aren't that useful. Or
baking seems like a natural for quick boosts, or
brewing.<BR><BR>
<B>Brad:</B> Yes, we plan on looking at all the skills.
For instance between jewelry and the poison he
did a quick upgrade on archery. The bows are
better, the number of arrows you can create. We
enhanced it so you can get your pattern back…
When we trade skills be done? Never. There is so
much that is there that could possibly be done.<BR><BR>
<B>Jason:</B> I guess for example, no one is
complaining about jewelry, people seem to be
ecstatic about, but… .<BR><BR>
<B>Brad:</B> For a while. Then we will go through and
we will upgrade enhance other skills and it will
loop back around. I'm definitely not trying to make
excuses here. I'm trying to maybe raise people's
mind sets to understand that it is just this
constant process. It's kind of a loop, you'll go
back around and then by the time you get back to
a class or a skill, a dungeon or an item, then
people might be tired of that because relative to
everything else it's no longer as powerful or great
as it as it once was. And then you enhance that,
and start the circle over again. That is just
revising and enhancing the content that is already
there and at the same time you want to always
be adding new stuff as well.<BR><BR>
To me, in all honesty, that is what I love about
this genre. Think about how long it took to build
Forgotten Realms, how many people worked
before it really became a fleshed out world where
you can go to Water Deep or something and find
out what is in the corner of a random sewer and
stuff like that, the amount of detail is amazing and
that is where we want to go with EverQuest.<BR><BR>
<B>Jason:</B> Do you think it's a goal since you talked
about the big patch to have each skill at least at
one point in time make people happy as jewelry
is now? Are you going to try to speed that up do
it before the expansion? Expand the skills? .<BR><BR>
<B>Brad:</B> We are very committed to enhancing our
trade skill system over time and it's definitely a
high priority. The game designer who is
responsible for trade skills is just full of awesome
ideas and he is a having a blast with make poison
and he can't wait to get to the next trade skill to
enhance that. Eventually you will see
interdependence in the trade skills where you
can't make a product unless you have another
player made product to use as a component. You
can sit back and brainstorm about this stuff.<BR><BR>
<B>Jason:</B> Well it's just a matter getting it
implemented I guess? .<BR><BR>
<B>Brad:</B> Right. It just takes time, I don't blame them
a bit. They will just have to trust us that we are
just as anxious as they are to get this in to the
game. The desire is there, we have the resources
and we are not going to stop.<BR><BR>
<B>Jason:</B> Let's talk about rare items. Do you guys
tweak the spawn rate on rare items? .<BR><BR>
<B>Brad:</B> At times .<BR><BR>
<B>Jason:</B> For instance Ghoulbane or the Polished
Granite Tommahawk. Have you made things like
that more rare? .<BR><BR>
<B>Brad:</B> Yes and some of them have been made
more common.<BR><BR>
<B>Jason:</B> Is spawn random or is it by kills, is there
are variable that says the Tommahawk will come
up every so many hours.<BR><BR>
<B>Brad:</B> Yes, there is a percentage chance. The
game designer responsible for that goes through
and adjusts it accordingly to keep items rare. To
keep the player economy from over flooding with
rare items it's based on how powerful the item is
how easy it is to get etc,. And another thing he
does is go through the zones and he will revise
them. For instance he may go back to High Pass
and move the Tommahawk to another NPC, or
completely remove the Tommahawk. We just
revised Permafrost to get people into that zone.
That's just more of a constant process. We don't
want a specific rare item to always be in the
same place and we also don't necessarily want it
to always be there. Maybe next week Ghoulbane
doesn't spawn anymore, maybe we feel there is
enough Ghoulbanes in the world and now we want
to create another unholy paladin sword. So now
there is only a finite quantity of Ghoulbanes.<BR><BR>
<B>Jason:</B> Along those lines are you going to make
an anti-camp measure to stop people from getting
those rare items by making a top level for the
item. For instance stopping 50th lvl folks coming
to the bottom of Befallen to camp the
shadowknight for the Bone Bladed Claymore,
meaning they could kill that thing all day and
never get it because they are just too high a level
for the item? .<BR><BR>
<B>Brad:</B> You know that is an issue I brought up on
the internet. Personally, I want to implement that.
And I really honestly regret we didn't implement
that in beta. It's one of those things where we can
change the world and the mechanics in beta, but
now that we are commercially released it's
harder. I'm not sure if we can make that sweeping
of a change. To me personally if an NPC does not
give you experience it should also not spawn any
kind of magical items. I don't think a level 40
wizard has any business nuking the
shadowknight in bottom of Befallen harvesting
BBCs. But every time I bring up that green rule
people start yelling and screaming. The upcoming
polling system will allow me to bring up issues
like that. I think that makes sense, but since
people have already gotten used to the fact that
they can already go do that making a sweeping
change to the game mechanics is something we
have to be careful with.<BR><BR>
<B>Jason:</B> What changes do you think then you will
be able to make to stop camping? Do you
consider camping to be a problem? .<BR><BR>
<B>Brad:</B> That's definitely a complicated issue.
Camping is in and of itself is just waiting for a
spawn. That by itself is not a problem. We knew
that was going to happen from day one, it's part of
the game. You learn of an item and it comes from
a certain place, you want the item and so you go
there to kill the creature that has the item. It's a
mini-quest of sorts. I have no problem with that,
the place where frustration and complaining
develops is when you go down there and there is
someone already sitting down there waiting for it.
That is one problem, the second is going down
there and they perceive the spawn to be too slow
and getting frustrated. But the big one is
someone else camping it and I'm not. And that is
a problem.<BR><BR>
<B>Jason:</B> You know for instance that people are
going to camp- the Dervish Cutthroats of North Ro
for instance are almost always camped.
Sometimes people share and sometimes they
don't. What happens when people don't share?
Some character shows up maybe a lone wizard
and starts blasting any time he has mana. What's
to be done about that? .<BR><BR>
<B>Brad:</B> That brings up another issue, the group
versus solo player, aggregate group damage
change.<BR><BR>
<B>Jason:</B> Is that for certain going to happen? .<BR><BR>
<B>Brad:</B> My plans for that is for it to be
implemented but have the programmer carefully
comment out all the old code. And what we will
probably do is turn it on for one or two live
servers.<BR><BR>
<B>Jason:</B> Lets explain this so everyone
understands.<BR><BR>
<B>Brad:</B> Right now the person who gets credit for
the kill is the person who deals the most damage
to that NPC. If you are in a group everyone in your
group can get credit for the kill. So what happens
often, I don't know how often but you hear about
it. A not so social wizard or necro or any class
that can deal out a lot of damage in a short period
of time, will come along and encounter an NPC
that is being fought by a bunch of people and then
do more quickly do more than 50 percent of the
damage to the creature. In effect stealing the kill.
Definitely anti-social behavior.<BR><BR>
Chronic kill stealing is against the rules. You are
encouraged to petition. If someone kill steals
chronically or to harass another player that is
against the rules a GM will come and warn that
person and if they keep it up they are gone. Now
that doesn't mean someone kill steals once or
there is some dispute over that the GM is going
to ban someone. But in the case of chronic
killstealing the GMs or Guides will interfere.<BR><BR>
Now there has been requests that we make it
such that the aggregate damage of the group
counts as a single unit. Our concern is that a
group and always do more damage than a single
person, so group of jerks could get together and
cause more havoc. But I am more than willing to
try it out. I'll implement that code we'll put it on
those couple servers for a week and if people are
jumping for joy then we will put it on the other
servers, if it turns out to make things worse we
will back the code out. No one knows what will
happen its theory as to the results right now. I'm
not going to announce which servers yet, I'll just
pick a couple random servers.<BR><BR>
<B>Jason:</B> *we got off on a tangent for a bit then Brad
got us back on track* .<BR><BR>
<B>Brad:</B> Let's get back the big issue on camping. I
definitely want to touch on camping again. There
are a lot of little solutions that pop up on the
Internet. And I really want to address those. Level
limits, and item level limits( which would in my
opinion would immediately destroy the player
driven economy I'm not interested in that.), there
is ideas that there should be no static spawn
points at all (which would ruin dungeons because
there would be no fighting your way to a goal in a
specific room.) And we do have random rare
spawns in outdoor areas already but it doesn't
make sense always.<BR><BR>
What we are going to do there are 2 issues. One
is to add more content. Let's take something like
rubicite. There probably should be an equivalent
to rubicite similarly challengingly to obtain to
spread people out. For instance there should
probably be more Dervish Camps so people are
spread people and not running into each other.
That is just generally more content which is
something we are trying to add all the time.<BR><BR>
But there is another issue that is definitely my
kind of get up on the soap box mission here to
hopefully enlighten people. And you probably
noticed this with my PR on Permafrost.<BR><BR>
People in general want to take the path of least
resistance. Knowledge is a great thing in this
game, comfort level, knowing where to go, also
zones reach a critical mass where there are
enough people there so that even if I get
overwhelmed people are safer. The three groups
you were just mad at for camping the same spot
might now come to your rescue. Now I'm
appreciative that this is a pretty populated area.
People like having other people around.<BR><BR>
But there are also all sorts of dungeons and other
areas that have 5 to 10 percent of the population
of more populated areas like Caizic Thule or
Unrest. But you go to Permafrost, RunnyEye,
Guk, or the easier part of Soulesek's Eye and
there is hardly anyone there. There are various
reasons why people aren't there, not comfortable
enough, they don't know about it, they are afraid,
there is some nasty rumor about falling in the lava
and never returning.</FONT><BR><BR></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
