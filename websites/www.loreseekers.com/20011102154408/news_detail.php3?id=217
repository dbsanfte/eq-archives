------------------------------<BR><BR>

*Patch Day*<BR><BR>

Today's patch primarily consists of tuning of Velious zones as well as content and other additions.  In addition, the following changes have been implemented on the Live servers:<BR><BR>

- High-end items that have a activatable (right-click) healing effect have in several cases had their casting times increased.<BR>
- Factions for some of the higher end encounters in Velious have received some adjustments.  Basically, "bad acts" receive more weight than "good acts".  For instance, if "A" hates "B" and "B" hates "A", killing "A" will hurt your faction with "A" more than it will help your faction with "B".<BR>
- The stamina reduction with "Resurrection Effects" has been replaced by a slight attack-speed debuff.<BR>
- The Ranger's Trueshot discipline now works correctly.  It was previously only working versus other player characters.<BR>
- The Shadow Knight's "Unholy Aura" discipline has received an enhancement.  When in use, harmtouch resistances will be checked versus disease instead of magic.  In addition, harmtouch will resist in the same fashion as lifetap spells, meaning that unless the creature is immune to disease, you should get full damage most of the time.<BR>
- The spell attached to the "Fiery Defender" can now be partially resisted instead of being "all or nothing".  The net result is that the average damage will be higher.<BR>
- The Paladin "Holy Forge" discipline will now give paladins triple the normal chance of scoring a critical hit.  Each critical hit has a percent chance to be scored as a critical blow.<BR>
- Added parameters to the /camp command (the command that will cause you to camp out if you are already sitting).  "/camp server" will take you back to the server selection screen.  "/camp desktop" will take you out to the desktop following a successful camp.  Despite popular request, "/camp spawn" will not be implemented.<BR>
- Walruses now indeed sound like they should.<BR>
- Added the /chatfontsize [0 to 5] (default is 1) command.  This command will allow players to adjust the size of the font in the chat window.<BR><BR>
