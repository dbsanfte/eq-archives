This is the Quest for the <A HREF="http://www.loreseekers.com/weapon_detail.php3?search=185">Shiny Star of Light</A><BR><BR>

This quest begins in North Qeynos at the Temple of Life with Astead Wemor.  To begin, hail Astead.  Advise him that you wish to provide service to the temple, and are willing to travel afar.  He will tell you to go to Rivervale to find the herbalist, Kizzie Mintopp, to obtain a desperately needed ingredient (Honey Jum).  He also tells you to tell her that you are from the Temple of Life.<BR><BR>

Once you reach Rivervale, and locate Kizzie, give her a hail and the catch phrase. She tells you that you were not due for another week.  She also tells you that she cannot make the Honey Jum because Joogl Honeybugger has not delivered any honeycomb to her due to his injuries.  Joogl, she says, can be found in his burrow just outside of Rivervale.  Where exactly Kizzie does not say.<BR><BR>

After you locate Joogl Honeybugger in the Misty Thicket, give him a bandage to receive faction and information on how to harvest three honeycombs and thirty gold pieces needed to satisfy Kizzie Mintopp's needs.  Joogl tells you that the Bixie Drones carry the honeycomb. This is true, but in fact, regular Bixies also drop honeycomb as well.<BR><BR>

Once you have the three honeycomb and thirty gold, give them to Kizzie Mintopp. You receive another faction adjustment and the Honey Jum. Return to the Temple of Life in North Qeynos.  Give the Honey Jum to Astead Wemor. You get another faction adjustment and some money, but you are not done yet. Astead Wemor gives you a unique potion designed to cure a madness particular to a farmer named Lempeck Hargrin.  Astead tells you that Lempeck Hargrin can be found in the Western Plains of Karana between the river and the crop fields.  Astead also bids you to hurry before it is too late.<BR><BR>

You find Lempeck Hargrin in his farmhouse in the area noted by Astead Wemor. Give the potion to Lempeck to cure him.  You receive another faction change, and a No Drop Scythe, which cannot be used by a cleric.  Take the Scythe back to Astead Wemor.   Upon receiving the Scythe, Astead Wemor gives you yet another faction adjustment, cash, and the end prize, the <A HREF="http://www.loreseekers.com/weapon_detail.php3?search=185">Shining Star of Light</A> (1h Blunt, damage: 6, Delay: 28, Casts Cleanse, Useable by clerics and paladins of all races).  He also tells you where to go when you need to recharge this weapon. The cleanse effect will cancel negative effects which you are suffering from such as disease or poison.<BR><BR>
