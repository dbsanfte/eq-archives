<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#00478E" SIZE="-1">
Hello All,<BR><BR>

I'd like to announce some pretty big changes for the better to our Customer Service:<BR><BR>

1) We are making a serious revision to our Item Reimbursement Policy. From this point forward, GM's will reimburse items to players that have lost them due to bugs. We've added a lot of logging capabilities, and the policy will be to reimburse the item, and then to verify in the logs that the item was indeed lost. Please be aware, if we watch people lying to us (i.e. a person says that they lost their Magic Item, but they really traded it to someone) we can and WILL ban people on their first offense. We think it's important that we place trust in people, rather than assuming they aren't telling the truth. The downside to this is that we will probably have a lot of people trying to scam us. Be warned - Don't try it.<BR><BR>

2) We're in the process of adding a lot more GM's. In addition, we're adding more GM's during the 7am - 4pm shift to better accommodate our International users. We're also adding a fair amount of Night GM's to assist players off hours.<BR><BR>

3) Our Customer Service phone calls are now completely handled out of the Verant facility here in San Diego. Before it was split between this facility and a Customer Service group out of Utah. In addition, we're adding a lot more phone support staff to better accommodate players.<BR><BR>

4) We've modified our Internal procedures with regards to how our GM's treat players. One of the biggest complaints we've seen is that GM's are rude or short with people. It's important to us that our Customers are treated with respect and appreciation, so we've been working with our GM's to try and make sure that players experiences with GM's are positive ones. In addition, we've been weeding out problem GM's. Please keep in mind, it's not an easy job being a GM and we do ask that players treat the GM's with respect as well. From here on out if you feel like a GM is being rude to you, please email our new Director of Customer Service, George Scotto at gscotto@station.sony.com<BR><BR>

5) We've added separate GM's for Quests and Events. Expect to see a lot more from us in the near future.<BR><BR>

6) We've put a new email system in place that should help ensure quick response.<BR><BR>

7) A different version of the Online Store will be going up soon. It will be web based and people will be able to order Kunark from it once it's up.<BR><BR>

Regards,<BR><BR>

<B>UPDATE:</B> Internet Relations Manager Gordon "Abashi" Wrinn followed up this announcement shortly after with a clarification of one section...<BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#00478E" SIZE="-1">
Hello all,<BR><BR>

One clarification that I need to mention in regards to the newly announced policies.<BR><BR>

The section that states, "We've added a lot of logging capabilities, and the policy will be to reimburse the item, and then to verify in the logs that the item was indeed lost.", infers that items will be reimbursed prior to investigation.<BR><BR>

Our intention is to handle all claims in a timely manner. Upon receiving a claim of item loss due to a bug, the GM will begin the investigation process (checking logs, backups, etc). This usually takes roughly 30 to 60 minutes to complete. The GM will then immediately take action and reimburse the item(s) based upon the outcome of the investigation.<BR><BR>

Our customers deserve courteous and prompt service, and we'll do everything in our power to insure that they receive it.<BR><BR>
