(special shout out to Verant for not screwing this one up :p)
<P>
We managed to kill Najena 3 times and get 2 FBRs and a Tome for some members.  Many Najena magicians and Froglok Ghouls were slayed in the process, alcohol tolerance skills were raised (LOVE those Bleeding Brains) and losses were at a minimum. (Special thanks goes out for locking me in the room alone with the magicians while everyone went out to kill a Froglok Ghoul, feelin  the love guys! :p hehe)  Bonecracker didn t want to seem to give up a whip for us, but there s always next time.  Special thanks to Tregen and everyone who spent their time brewing all those Bleeding Brains, Bottles of Wine, Short Beers and Fierce Brews for everyone.  I think we had almost 500 bottles of booze with us, lol.  I know I still have plenty left over that i was carrying, so I ll hold for the next event.
<P>
Congratulations goes out to Kyramir and Wiloe for their promotions to the rank of Officer.  Glad to have you there.
<P>
Due to the overwhelming response to this event, we will be having another one in two weeks from now (Friday Dec. 3rd) at the same time (10:00 EST, 7 PST).  I would like to try and get some nice items for the non-casters this time, or both, so email me where you would like to hit next and popular vote wins! (yes Bocephous, I know, you want your Darkforge armor hehe :p )
<P>
Thanks everyone for coming out and making this the fun event it was.
