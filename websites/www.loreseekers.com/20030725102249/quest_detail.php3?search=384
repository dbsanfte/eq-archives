<B>Note:</B> This quest is in Paineel. Until we get our website domains split and redo the databases to show all new zones (including the upcoming expansion ones) we will show Paineel quests in "Other".<BR><BR>

Hail Ernax the Scholar on the first floor of the library in Paineel. He wll say leave him be because he his reading about mana storage devices. Say to him 'I wish to speak to you on a matter of the soul', and he then says he hasn't heard anyone say that in a while and is surprised that you want to follow the legacy of Azraxs. He then gives you a letter and tells you to follow and write down the instructions on it and then give the letter back to him.<BR><BR>

The letter explains how to make a Soul Trap. The needed components are a bloody mantle, the heart of a druid of reknown, and a crystal of capturing. These items need to be combined in a Soul Trap Box (which he gives you.) The letter also said that the completed Soul Trap needs to be given to the soul you wish to manipulate.  (I suspect the Tormented Soul in the necromancer guild house is the soul that is to be manipulated).<BR><BR>

The bloody mantle comes from the assassin, which is a level 50 mob that randomly spawns from Faydwer to the Karanas, to Everfrost.<BR><BR>

The druid of reknown is an elf and is in a forest.  That's all he will tell you about that.<BR><BR>

The crystal of capturing is made by Jalen Goldsinger the Tox forest. Jalen says he needs a Potion of Sorrow and 1000 gp to make a crystal  for you.  The potion is obtained from Gorth Bearsoul in Halas for 500 gp.<BR><BR>

Give the letter back to Ernax and you get a Soul Trap Box. a 4 slot container with a combine button.  Of note is the fact that he only asks for 3 items.  Completing this quest will greatly increase your faction with the Lich Miragul.<BR><BR>
