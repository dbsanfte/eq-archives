The first part of this quest (the Kunzar and Nathsar medallions) gets you the Idol of Trakanon, which I think gets you into Old Sebelis (where you will probably find Trakanon).<BR><BR>

The second part (the Kylong, Obulus, and Jarsath medallions, plus proof of Trakanon's death) may well get you into Veeshan's Peak.<BR><BR>

Not far south from the Swamp of No Hope zone, there's a passage going into the wall. At the end of the passage, there's a huge room with a red viper-looking throne, and on the throne there's a ghost-looking Iksar floating. He was red to me at 49, and conned indifferent.  His name is Emperor Ganak, and here's what he had to say:<BR><BR>

You say, <I>"Hail Emperor Ganak"</I><BR>
Emperor Ganak says <I>"Greetings..It has been long since I have been aware on this plane..Who are you and what do you want of I, Ganak, slayer of Jaled-Dar?"</I><BR><BR>

You say, <I>"What is veeshan's peak?"</I>.<BR>
Emperor Ganak says <I>"You wish to know of Veeshans Peak?! You are either very brave or very foolish! There is nothing there for the uninvited but a fiery death. I have been away from this plane of existence for a long time yet still I feel the presence of the ancient wurms. I am sure they sense my presence as well, being as I hold the only [key to the chambers] of the Ring of Scale."</I><BR><BR>

You say, <I>"What about the key to the chambers?"</I>.
Emperor Ganak says <I>"I am not so quick to grant someone the key to their death! If you truly wish your doom to fall upon you so soon then bring me the three medallions of the fallen Iksar tribes, <B>Kylong</B>, <B>Obulus</B>, and <B>Jarsath</B>. The tribes were long ago crushed by the warriors of the Kunzar and their remains lye buried beneath ages of rubble. Finding the lost medallions of my people will not be enough to prove your worthy of entry into the fortress of the great wurms there is another task that you must complete before you return the medallions."</I><BR><BR>

You say, <I>"What medallions?"</I>.<BR>
Emperor Ganak says <I>"There were five different tribes of my people. The Kunzar, Kylong, Nathsar, Obulus, and Jarsath. Each of these tribes had a medallion that represented it. If you can return to me the Medallion of the Kunzar and Nathsar, I will give you the idol of Trakanon."</I><BR><BR>

You say, <I>"What task."</I><BR>
Emperor Ganak says <I>"Those who enter Veeshans Peak uninvited by the lords of the Ring of Scale become nothing more than a snack for the wurms that dwell within its halls. Once you cross the threshold of the Peak there Is no escape. Any fool dedicated enough to locate the medallions can do so, but it takes a truly mighty individual to slay the dragon that has plagued my people for ages. I speak of the poison dragon Trakanon, the vile undead wurm that has conquered my peoples greatest wurmslayers. Bring me proof of Trakanons death with the medallions I request and I may deem you worthy of the key to the Ring of Scale."</I><BR><BR>

I am told that the medallions of Kunzar and Nathsar drop from the Froglock Hunter and Forager in Trakanon's Teeth. These Mobs spawn one after another, so they are fairly easy to get. Turn in these two medallions and you should get the Idol of Trakanon, which will get you into Old Sebilis.<BR><BR> 

The quest for <A HREF="quest_detail.php3?search=433">Medallion of the Obulus</A> is located in The Burning Woods.  The quest for the <A HREF="quest_detail.php3?search=435">Medallion of the Kylong</A> is located in the Lake of Ill Omen.  The quest for the <A HREF="quest_detail.php3?search=436">Medallion of Jarsath</A> is located in the Timorous Deep.<BR><BR>

If you find a piece of medallion, be sure to identify it to see which medallion it belongs to. I think that turning in these three medallions, plus something that drops from Trakanon (a tooth perhaps) will get you the Key to Veeshan's Peak. Be warned that it is supposed to be difficult, if not impossible, to get out of Veeshan.
