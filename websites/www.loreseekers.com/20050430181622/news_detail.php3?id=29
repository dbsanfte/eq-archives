to expel the foul creatures of Befallen.<BR>
For many hours we were able to hold the secret<BR>
area of the third floor, removing the Troll SK,<BR>
the Necro's in the Gossimer room, and all the <BR>
various other foul creatures inhabiting this evil<BR> 
place.<BR><BR>
Overall the night was quite a success with some<BR>
of the most noteworthy happenings listed below -<BR><BR>

- Inducted Brinx as our newest Bertoxxulous member.<BR><BR>

- Rescued a poor soul who had fallen through the<BR>
hole in the second floor.<BR><BR>

- Rescued a group who had died just inside the<BR>
3rd locked door.<BR><BR>

- Killed SK and got the Bone Bladed Claymore for<BR>
Notami, who was in desperate need of a better<BR>
weapon.<BR><BR>

- Killed the Necro Priest who held in his hands<BR>
the Blackened Wand.<BR><BR>

- Looted much Bronze and Raw-Hide off of the various<BR>
other inhabitants of the area.<BR><BR>

We defiantly made a name for ourselves, both as<BR>
being a powerful group, and as a group willing<BR>
to help those in need (even at the expense of our<BR>
own lives, sorry Brinx and Lilli.)<BR><BR>

Attending: Spye, Notami, Shahk, Lilli, Tulenya, Brinx.<BR></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
