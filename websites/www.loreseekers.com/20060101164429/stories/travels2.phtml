	<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>C</B></FONT>hapter Two:  Odious Odus

	<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>A</B></FONT>s you know from the first chapter, my purpose is to acquaint the reader with odd or beautiful places across Norrath.  Early on, my attention had been caught by my Great Uncle Tarker Blasetoss’ ability to travel freely across Norrath. In my twentieth year of the study of Wizardry, I at last learned the first three of the Combine Gate Spells, Fay Gate, North Gate, and Toxulia Gate, giving me access to the three great continents of what was then our world.  My mother was very happy, as she could now send me with food packages to her sister (an enchantress studying in the Enchanter Guild in Erudin Palace – how an elven woman was accepted there is another and odd story involving the capture and detention of a female cousin of mine by the Priest of Najena, and I will not relate it; go ask my aunt if you are interested).    So one Spring morning, my backpack full of Felwithe Fish Cakes and Elven wine, I said goodbye to my parents and, not without trepidation, cast the Toxulia Gate spell for the first time.

	<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>A</B></FONT>rriving in that dismal forest the Erudites call home, I was aghast to discover that they tolerated the presence of Necromancy in that realm. Running through the yellow-scum fog of that place, I at last escaped into the relative protection of the City of the So-Called “High Men”.  After delivering my packages to my aunt (I think she threw away the fish cakes but did drink the wine…), I decided to wander around a bit.  I quickly found the inhabitants to be most disagreeable, racists and insulting.  Even at the Wizard Guildhall, where I was due a warm professional welcome and lodging, the Guildmaster would do nothing but sneer at me and tell me to go away!  If these are “high-men”, I thought, “what of the Low?”   Going invisible, I discovered vaults below the palace; but nothing of great interest was there.

	<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>L</B></FONT>eaving the Palace,  I materialized near the great blue stone which had teleported me inside.  Out of the corner of my eye, I caught movement up the stairs.  Looking closely, I saw a troll!  It was staring at a wall and the guards were not attacking it!  I cautiously made my way towards it after casting Invisibility upon myself in what was to prove a needless act.  As a approached it more closely, I saw that it had a strange greenish aura about it…was it one of the Servants of the Gods known as Guides?  I had never seen one before and had believed them to be a myth…but here stood a troll and the guards were chatting with it!  Listening to their conversation, I learned that it was indeed a Guide and that the City Guards were complaining to it that some god had cursed the wall there beside the teleport to the inside of the palace, such that if someone was either careless or tried too hard, they fell through the wall finding themselves in a strange room without exit, adorned, if you wish to call it that, with innumerable pictures of the same cat. Indeed, putting my ear to the wall, I could hear the shouts of a paladin of Erudin begging to be let out!

	<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>A</B></FONT>t this point, I truly discovered that the Troll was a Servant of the Gods, as it looked right at me and addressed me (though I was invisible).  It’s name was Talun the Fat, it said, and it was in the employ of the Twins of Marr.  It asked me if I would do it (and them) a favor that day?  What was I to say to such an Exalted One but, “of course!”  I was a bit crest-fallen when all it wanted was that I try to enter this hidden spot by, replicating the poor trapped paladin’s actions.  Pressing back and forth on the wall, I at first was without success.  However, just as we were getting frustrated and contemplating abandonment of the attempt, I found myself falling thru a crack in the wall we had not seen!  The Paladin and I were in a small whitish room, paneled with identical pictures of a small tabby cat. Hideous!  Suddenly, the Guide was there with us.  He told us to be patient, and discorporated.  Suddenly, I felt that I had been summoned by the gods! I found myself back outside where I had met the guide, together with the paladin.  I have in after days repeated this, using Gate to escape the confines of the room.  It is difficult to find the entry and I have no clear idea even of the exact spot, it merely being a spot, on an angle, I think, of the wall beside the teleport.

	<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>C</B></FONT>ontinuing to wander Erudin, I cast Levitation and was able to climb some roofs.  At some point, I made it onto the mount that the Palace is built upon.  I was able to circle this mount, but not find entrance to the Palace, and to come down at the docks on the further side.  From the top, you can see all of the Erudin City (such as it is…) and the adjacent shore.

	<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>T</B></FONT>here is little else of interest on this odious island (I cannot in fairness call it a Continent, as it is too small).  One point of danger have I found in later years, that I will mention.  When you enter the evil city of Paineel (do not ask me why I did so…), you are immediately confronted by the huge abyss called The Hole.  With Spirit of Wolf and Levitation, you can, on the far side, climb up the rock.  Be very careful here:  do not fall in! And at the top, beware!  Right above where you can climb up, is a “trough” or depression.  If you jump down into this, you will, even with Levitation, be unable to get back out.

	<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>I</B></FONT> have explored the depths of the River in Toxulia, and all its surrounding area, without finding anything of Norrathographical interest.  I have not studied the Paineel City, nor the Hole closely, but have not found anything of note there either.  Nothing seems of value in Kerra Ridge either.  All in all, this island should be called  “Odious”, not Odus.  It is not for no reason that all its best inhabitants wander the other lands rather than remain here!  All in all, a dismal and useless place (though travelers are reporting wonderful artifacts from the Hole).
