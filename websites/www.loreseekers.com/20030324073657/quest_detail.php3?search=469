<FONT SIZE="2" FACE="verdana, arial">
The following is all the information I have seen so far on this quest. The quest has been completed by Kaylum of Tunare and the reward for this is a very nice weapon called the <A HREF="weapon_detail.php3?search=469">RageBringer</A>. A complete spoiler has not been published as of yet, but here is the information so far that I have seen on the <A HREF="http://server3.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse" TARGET="_new">Safehouse Forums</A>.<BR><BR>

To begin the quest, talk with an NPC named <B>Vilnius the Small</B> in West Karana (LOC 170, -6705). You discover that he is waiting for some hired help that is late with an errand...
</FONT><BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="1" COLOR="#FFFDCA">
You say, "hail Vilnius the Small"<BR><BR>

Vilnius the Small says, "Montys, just because I am short don't mean I can't bounce your Wood Elf rump all over these hills. Now, do you have something for me, or are you just in search of a rump bouncing?"<BR><BR>

You say, "Why are you Vilnius the Small"<BR><BR>

Vilnius the Small says, "Vilnius, as I have told you. And yes, I am not as large as most of my kin. But that is a blessing, because my brain is bigger than that of an Erudite. <grin> I am a Facilitator. I.. facilitate.. jobs. You want something somebody else has, I can arrange for you to have it.. even if that something is their life. That is why I am here now, waiting on something to turn up in my hands before I pass it on to my client. Though I am a bit tired of waiting. My hired help seem to be delayed."<BR><BR>

You say, "What delayed"<BR><BR>

Vilnius the Small says, "Yes, delayed. She has always been prompt in the past, but she is several days overdue, and I know for a fact she completed the job. I am beginning to wonder if something happened to her. I would go check, but I run the risk of missing her if she shows up here."<BR><BR>

You say, "I will help"<BR><BR>

Vilnius the Small says, "Oh, really? So you are willing to wade into Qeynos to track Malka down, or to find out what happened to her? Willing to take up the job if she failed? Willing to risk the wrath of the entire Circle of Unseen Hands? Wonderful, I do so appreciate enthusiasm! Send Malka back to me, or deliver the pouch she was hired to steal, either one. If that works out, maybe we can do more business, I am always looking for new people to help me... Facilitate."
</FONT><BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE="2" FACE="verdana, arial">
This leads you to <B>Malka Rale</B>, who can be found in the Qeynos Aquaducts...
</FONT><BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="1" COLOR="#FFFDCA">
You say, "Hail Malka Rale"<BR><BR>

Malka Rale says, "Whew! I thought you were one of Hanns' goons. These sewers are a mess, you never know what is going to turn up next. I really wish I could get out of here."<BR><BR>

You say, "I can help you get out of here"<BR><BR>

Malka Rale says, "Aye, Tyras, out of here. I am stuck until the heat dies down. The Circle has all the exits covered, though they are not stupid enough to send someone in here after me. I HOPE!<grin> In any case, I can't get back out to West Karana to meet my contact, and I was paid quite a lot of money to do this job. I hate having unfinished business."<BR><BR>

You say, "I can help you do the job"<BR><BR>

Malka Rale says, "Ok! I am trusting you. Take this pouch to Vilnius in West Karana. Last word I had from him, he was hanging out near one of the bandit camps. Be careful, since he does not know you. Just give him the pouch, and tell him I was.. delayed. <grin> While you are doing that, I will be thinking of a way to get out of this slimehole. With any luck, the Circle will learn the pouch is out of Qeynos, and will assume I got away. That means they won't be looking for me here"
</FONT><BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE="2" FACE="verdana, arial">
Handing the Pouch to Vilnius the Small will apparently get you started on three jobs that need to be done... collecting sets for his clients (NOTE: These subquests may not be needed to finish the quest)<BR><BR>

<B>Job 1:</B><BR>
Collect a set of 4 swords: Pain Bringer, Flesh Ripper, Mithral Two-Hander, Giant Zwiehander. The reward is a Jagged Diamond Dagger (9/22 lore, magic)<BR><BR>

After completing the first job, he has this to say....
</FONT><BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana, arial" SIZE="1" COLOR="#FFFDCA">
"Very good, though how you managed to lug around all these oversized blades amazes me. I feel we can do business now, and Maltra still has not shown up. Take this dagger. I had an old client who didn't, um.. pay.. so this was extracted from him. Right after it was inserted in him. For your next job, I need a collection of robes. The robe of the Ishva, some Shining Metallic robes, an Oracle robe, and a Robe of the Kedge. I am not even sure where all these come from, but they are on my list here, and Rokyl is one of my best clients, so I figure that is your job."</FONT><BR>
(NOTE: Rokyl is apparently just part of the storyline and not a key npc for the quest)<BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE="2" FACE="verdana, arial">
<B>Job 2:</B><BR>
Collect s set of 4 robes: Robe of the Kedge, Robe of the Ishva, Shiny Metalic Robe, Robe of the Oracle. The reward is a Cazic <something> Dagger (8/23, Magic, Effect: Shadow Vortex, No Drop Lore)<BR><BR>

<B>Job 3:</B><BR>
Collect a set of 4 rapiers: Burning Rapier, Eyerazia, Martune Rapier, Well Balanced Rapier. The reward is information to further your quest.<BR><BR>

After this point it appears you must give the Pouch over to another NPC named <B>Anson McBale</B>, who is in the smuggler's camp in Highhold. This will spawn an NPC named <B>Stanos</B>. Stanos gives you the most information on finishing this quest and here is what is known so far about what he needs to be done...<BR><BR>

Stanos wants 2 notes. The first note is found on <B>Founy</B> in Kaladim and the second note is found on <B>Tani N'Mak</B> in Neriak 3rd Gate. You need to pick pocket these notes and your skill should be over 200 before you attempt it. Returning the notes to Stanos will result in him giving you a new note to take to <B>Eldreth</B> in Lake Rathe.<BR><BR>

Eldrath will ask for some milk and 100 pp, when he then gives you yet another note to take to <B>Yendar Starpyre</B> in Steamfont.<BR><BR>

Yendar will give you another note back and ask you to fetch the <B>Book of Souls</B>. The book spawns in the chambers of the Maestro in the Plane of Hate.<BR><BR>

Handing the book and the note back to Yendar will spawn a nasty mob named <B>Redux</B>, so have some friends close to help you kill it.<BR><BR>

After this it seems there is another nasty mob to kill in Kithicor.<BR><BR>

The key thing to note here is that apparently Stanos will give you all the information you need to finish this quest, so the above should get you well on your way to completing this quest.<BR><BR>

Finally, the reward for all this is a very nice Rogue weapon called <A HREF="weapon_detail.php3?search=469">RageBringer</A>!
