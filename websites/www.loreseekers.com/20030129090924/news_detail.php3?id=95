<A HREF="armor.phtml"><B>Armor:</B></A><BR>

I finally got the armor database filled and updated completely! 832 pieces of armor are now there, all fully searchable and cross-linked with any applicable quests.<BR><BR>

Just a few notes on these databases….<BR><BR>
<FONT SIZE="2" FACE="ARIEL">
<B>1. </B>This is one of the most complete armor databases online. Although there is undoubtedly some items missing and/or incorrect, I took every effort to verify each item before posting. I only posted items I have seen screenshots of, and I checked the stats against those posted on three other large EQ Info websites. When I got any conflicting information between sites, I didn't post that item unless I could personally verify it. Also you will see many Plane items that have a "??" in the notes… this is because I ran across a lot of higher level items that were posted on one site as coming from Fear and on another site as coming from Hate. <BR><BR>

<B>2. </B>The weapon database is also 90% done. It only needs an update as I have not added to it for the past month or more do to the demands on my time getting the armor one filled up. Look for it to be completely updated by the end of this weekend.<BR><BR>

<B>3. </B>While entering all this data into our PHP3 databases, I have also been completing Excel Spreadsheets of them. Older versions are already posted in our <A HREF="files.phtml">Files</A> section, but by the end of this weekend I will have formated and posted complete and updated versions. Look for a News announcement when I get them up. You may have already seen some "compendiums" posted on other sites that have a similar purpose, but just for comparison, ours has over 832 armor pieces, and over 340 weapons! This is hundreds more then the next largest spreadsheet ever posted.<BR><BR>

<B>4. </B>There is a small bug in the search engine for the items database. Currently when you search for a specific class, it fails to display all the items that have an All/All application, only showing items that actually have their class listed. This will be fixed very shortly, as soon as I can get our vacationing webmaster to work his MySQL magic on the script (*grin*).<BR><BR>

<B>5. </B>And finally… now that this is done, I am starting work on the next big database to be added to this site. Lore Items. Soon we will have a complete list of all those various Lore Items, No Drop and otherwise, that are used for quests. You will then be able to enter  the name of some unknown item you discovered into a search engine and it will tell you what that item is used for and link you to the applicable quest, if it is available.</FONT><BR><BR>

<A HREF="tales.phtml"><B>Stories:</B></A><BR>

Started a new section up where will will be posting some stories, songs and poems created by our talented members. We have been showcasing some of these wonderful tales on our opening page, and I decided they needed a permanent home. Use the above link for now to get to this page, until we get it added as a menu item this weekend hopefully.<BR><BR>

<A HREF="screenshots.phtml"><B>Screenshots:</B></A><BR>

Added 14 new <I>Ruins of Kunark</I> screenshots that were just posted on the official RoK website a few days ago. They were taken in 1024 x 768 fullscreen mode with a TNT II based video card and are quite amazing. Check them out if you want to see a detailed look at the new Race we can play!<BR><BR>
