Well, as most of you already know… there has been some major problems with the shipping of the Kunark expansion to people who ordered it off the on-line store. I thought I would just give you all some updates on what is going on it seems. <BR><BR>

As of late last night, Verant has said any orders received by yesterday (April 18th) *should* make it to your door on or before the 24th. Personally, I think that is a pipe dream. I work for an airline that flies on contract for a major courier company, and I know a little about the business… With this weekend being Easter, almost all shipping and freight companies will be shutting down early on Friday the 21st and not going again till Monday the 24th. Therefore that leaves only today and tomorrow to ship. If Verant did upgrade everyone's orders to 'overnight' status, then it is possible that the majority of North American customers may get their copy by Monday. However, for those people in Europe and elsewhere overseas, the weekend is even worse because a lot of other countries have Monday as a stat holiday as well. So I wouldn't hold my breath hoping to get the expansion before the 24th. (I hope I am proved wrong!) <BR><BR>

Here are links to all the official threads on this problem in order…<BR><BR>
