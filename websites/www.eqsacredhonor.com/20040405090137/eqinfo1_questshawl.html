<br>
Frost Giant Toes, Kromrif Heads, Feeding the Coldain &amp; Saving Tanik Quest<br>
<br>
STEP #1:<br>
<br>
Frost Giant Toes<br>
<br>
Go to Loremaster Borannin, (located in the Temple of Brell), in Thurgadin and
say, &quot;I seek to perform duties for the crown.&quot;<br>
(The Grand Historian next to him will tell you what to say to him if you hail
him.)<br>
Borannin will ask you to bring back to him four frost giant toes.&nbsp;<br>
Frost giant toes seem to drop randomly of all frost giants. And will take you a
few hours of killing Frost Giants while in a group.<br>
Giving him the four toes.<br>
<br>

STEP #2:<br>
<br>
Kromrif Heads<br>
<br>
After receiving the Burlap Coldain Prayer Shawl, you then ask, &quot;What Task?&quot;<br>
Loremaster Borannin says, &quot;Every year the Dain replaces the trophies in his
trophy room. There is a reward given for the best new trophy obtained. I intend
to win this year and I will upgrade your prayer shawl for assisting me. Fill
this box with ten Kromrif heads and bring me the combined contents along with
the burlap shawl. I will submit the best one for the Dains consideration.&quot;<br>
<br>
He then gives you a Preservationists Box. Fill the box with 10 Kromrif Heads
(Frost Giant) and hit combine to make a box of Preserved Kromrif Heads.
Hopefully, you have already acquired a few heads and have been saving them. Go
kill some more Frost Giants and collect the rest of your heads. This is going to
take 2-3 days of killing giants to accomplish.<br>
DO NOT CLICK COMBINE until you are READY to give it directly to Borannin, this
is a NO RENT item.<br>
Then give Borannin Preserved Kromrif Heads box along with Burlap Coldain Prayer
Shawl.<br>
<br>
Loremaster Borannin says, &quot;Ahh, some fine specimens indeed. I will have the
best of these mounted at once, wish me luck in the contest! Here is the Cloth
Prayer Shawl of our people. Before I forget, the council has issued yet another
[chore] for you to complete.&quot;<br>

STEP #3<br>
<br>
Feeding the Coldain<br>
<br>
After receiving the Cloth Coldain Prayer Shawl, you say, &quot;What chore?&quot;&nbsp;<br>
Loremaster Borannin says, &quot;The council agrees that you have demonstrated a
disdain for our enemy, the Kromrif, that rivals our own. They now ask that you
demonstrate your loyalty to the Dain by humbling yourself and serving our
people.&nbsp; Give this, my seal, to Mordin. He will instruct you further.&quot;<br>
<br>
Borannin tells you to go to Mordin. (Located in Mordin's Meats at -220, -220)&nbsp;<br>
You say, &quot;Hail Mordin Frostcleaver&quot;.&nbsp;<br>
Mordin Frostcleaver says, &quot;Ah, hello there, and welcome to me shop. Ye'll
have to excuse the mess but I've been havin a bloody good time here lately. . .
HAR HAR, ye get it? Anyways, thanks to you offlanders I now have a selection of
some exotic meats never afore seen here on Velious. In addition to supplyin' the
freshest meat in Thurgadin I also offer tasks to<br>
would-be hunters in the wastes.&quot;<br>
<br>
Give Mordin Borannin's seal and he said the following.&nbsp;<br>
Mordin Frostcleaver says, &quot;Hullo, I see you've signed on for a bit of food
service eh? Well we can always use an extra pair a hands here dat's fer sure.
First things first, warsh yer grubby mitts an cook up dinner fer good ol Leif.
Shouldn be too tough fer ye, he has simple enough taste. Make him a Tundrabear
sandwich an lemme know when he's been fed. Dontcha<br>
ferget ta give him this with his meal.&quot;<br>
<br>
Your faction standing with Coldain got better&nbsp;<br>
Your faction standing with DainFrostreaverIV got better&nbsp;<br>
Your faction standing with Kromzek got worse&nbsp;<br>
Your faction standing with Kromrif got worse&nbsp;<br>
You gain
experience!!&nbsp;<br>
<br>
He gives you a napkin named &quot;Leif's Napkin&quot; is No Drop.<br>
You say, &quot;What is a Tundrabear Sandwich?&quot;<br>
Mordin Frostcleaver says &quot;Dat's easy, ye just take a slab a dat Tundra
Kodiak meat and a jug a sauce, put it in da oven, den combine the product with a
loaf a bread in a mixin bowl an there ye be.&quot; &nbsp;(Mixing bowl can be
purchased, instead of made. Rashinda Elore at The Office of Landholders in North
Freeport or I can make you one.)&nbsp; If your skill is high enough you get the
sandwich, which is No Drop.<br>
(Trivial at about Baking level 80)<br>
<br>
***RECIPE for Tundra Bear Sandwich at the bottom of this post.<br>
<br>
Turn this sandwich in to Guard Leif, (located in front of the Paladin Training
Hall at -280,+500), with the napkin and get a &quot;Used Napkin&quot; back. It
is also No Drop.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Give the used napkin to Mordin and get the next part of the quest. He needs you
to make some Snow Bunny Stew for Trita Coldheart (name?). You get &quot;Trita's
Napkin&quot; (No Drop).<br>
<br>
You say, &quot;What is Snow Bunny Stew?&quot;<br>
Mordin Frostcleaver says, &quot;Simple enuff, getcherself two hunksa Bunny meat
and a jug a sauces. Stir 'em in a mixin bowl, then put spices and two flasks a
water with it and cook it in a pot. Mmmm, zesty!&quot;<br>
(The pot can be made with the blacksmithing skill, and/or pottery.&nbsp; Gundy
made mine.&nbsp; But I can make the pots now as long as one of our Blacksmiths
will make me some metal bits.&nbsp; And YES, you have to go slaughter the
bunnies yourself.)&nbsp;<br>
(Trivial at about Baking level 103)<br>
<br>
***RECIPE for Snow Bunny Stew at the bottom of this post.<br>
<br>
Give the stew to Trita, (located inside the Coldheart Residence across from
Frostbeard's Furs &amp; Leather at -115, +320), with the Napkin and receive a
dirty pot in return. Then take the pot and give that back to Mordin and you will
be given the next part of the quest.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Next you need to create an Ulthork Meat Pie for Brita. You receive Brita's
napkin, No Drop.&nbsp;<br>
You say, &quot;What is Ulthork Meat Pie?&quot;&nbsp;<br>
Mordin Frostcleaver says, &quot;Hmm, lemme look that one up. Been awhile since I
made one. Here we are, two Ulthork meats, a vinegar and a spices in a mixin
bowl. Put yer meat mix, a clump a dough, an a pie tin in da oven an yer good ta
go.&quot;<br>
<br>
This requires 2 Ulthork meat, and the problem here is that if you're not careful
you will eat the meat. Most of the items you need to collect or make are edible.
I know the Kodiak meat and bunny meat do not get eaten, but everything else
seems to disappear if not below your food in your inventory. Get eggs off the
snakes in the newbie zone in West Freeport for the clump of dough.<br>
(The pie tin is another stumbling block here unless you are good at
blacksmithing and pottery. Again, Gundy was my source here.&nbsp; Since then, I
have made my own pie tins.)<br>
(Trivial at about Baking level 114)<br>
<br>
***RECIPE for Ulthork Meat Pie at the bottom of this post.<br>
<br>
Turn the pie and the napkin in to Lorekeeper Brita in the back of the Library
(located at -180, +800), and receive a dirty pie tin which you take back to
Mordin for the final step in this quest.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The final task is to create a Snow Griffon Soufflé. The person you are making
this for is none other than the Grand Historian Thoridain himself, so it has to
be made well.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
You say, &quot;What is Snow Griffon Soufflé?&quot;<br>
Mordin Frostcleaver says, &quot;This one's a bit tricky, ya toss four snow
griffin eggs and a pack of spices in de oven. Ye must bake it just right or it's
all gunna be wasted. When yer done bring it to Thoridain and if ye did it right
he'll give ye his special seal. Just show Borannin that seal and yer shawl and
he'll know that yer finished in the kitchen.&quot;<br>
(Trivial at about Baking level 127)<br>
<br>
***RECIPE for Snow Griffon Soufflé` at the bottom of this post.<br>
<br>
So now you need 4 Snow Griffon eggs. Go kill Snow Griffons. Be careful. High
magic resistance.<br>
<br>
Once you've made the soufflé turn it in to Grand Historian Thoridain with the
napkin.<br>
<br>
Grand Historian Thoridain says, &quot;My compliments, what a wonderful dish!
Please accept my personal Seal as a token of my appreciation. May it give you
power over your adversaries.&quot;<br>

<br>
He gives you his Seal to give to Borannin with your second Prayer Shawl. Now
give Borannin the Seal &amp; Shawl.<br>
<br>
Loremaster Borannin says, &quot;Well done, the council will be impressed with
your effort. Here is the woven prayer shawl, wear it with pride. I know there is
talk of great plans for you, be sure to come back and ask me what the council
has [brewing].&quot;<br>

STEP #4<br>
<br>
Saving Tanik<br>
<br>
Look in your inventory to check out the stats on the shawl. It is as expected,
one better on each stat over the second one, just like the ring quests.&nbsp;
What seems to shock most is that along with the third shawl you also receive
back from Borannin the Seal of Thoridain. So with this third quest we get two
items. The shawl and the Seal which is an incredible nice item.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
He alludes to the fourth quest in this series, but when questioned about it says
there will soon be much to do.&nbsp;<br>
You say, &quot;What is brewing?&quot;<br>
Loremaster Borannin says, &quot;Ahh yes, good to see you again. I wish it were
under better circumstances that we meet today. For some time now we have sent
teams of our finest rogues to gather intelligence for the Dain. Tanik Greskil is
one of our best. He was recently sent into the heart of Kael Drakkel on a very
important mission and has not returned. He is<br>
now long overdue, and fearing the worst, our wise council has asked me to
dispatch a rescue party to determine what has become of him and return him to
safety. I have decided to give you this opportunity to build upon the trust you
have earned from the council. Will you accept this mission?&quot;&nbsp;<br>
You say, &quot;I will accept this mission&quot;<br>
Loremaster Borannin says, &quot;The council will be pleased to hear of your
acceptance. Scour the regions surrounding the city of the Giants. Discover what
happened to Tanik and, if possible, return him to Thurgadin. If you are
successful, remember to hand me your woven shawl. We seem to be running low on
them, but I must say Mordin has never had so much help in the kitchen. Anyway, I
will eagerly await word of your findings. Good luck, and may Brell protect
you.&quot;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
If you wander around the Eastern Wastes near NEG 6644 POS 4337, (which is next
to Kael), you will hopefully eventually see a message &quot;the snow crumbles
away revealing an injured coldain&quot; or something like that. This reveals
Tanik Greskil.&nbsp;<br>
***He has also been found down by the entrance to Kael, down the ramp!&nbsp; So,
not necessarily at the above LOC!! Be careful of Giant Guards!***<br>
You say, &quot;Hail Tanik Greskil.&quot;<br>
Tanik Greskil says, &quot;Outlander! Thank Brell you've found me! I am the last
surviving member of my unit. Our mission was somehow compromised, the bloody
Kromrif knew just where to find us... I can't imagine how they knew. I was
barely able to escape with my life and wandered into a trap here. I am badly
hurt and need your help.&quot;&nbsp;<br>
You say, &quot;I will help&quot;&nbsp;<br>
Tanik Greskil says, &quot;Quickly, give me a vial of Veluim Vapors so I can
return home, I am in desperate need of some attention from our clerics.&quot;<br>
You say, &quot;What is velium vapors?&quot;&nbsp;<br>
Tanik Greskil says, &quot;Drat! Are you telling me you don't have one with you?
Run back to Thurgadin at once and speak with Frundle, she can make you one. I
will do what I can to stay alive. I may need to move about a bit to keep from
being discovered. Hurry now outlander, you're my only hope.&quot;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Tanik will give you nothing, I skipped going out and looking for Tanik until
after doing the next part:<br>
<br>
You say, &quot;Hail Frundle Frenkler&quot; (Who is conveniently located across
from the Paladin Training Hall, in an unlabeled building, Neg 400, Pos 500.)<br>
You say, &quot;What velium vapors?&quot;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Frundle Frenkler says,&quot;Ahh, you come seeking my family recipe? After all
you've done for our people it's the least I can do. First you must fashion a
velium vial, then combine the vial with two small pieces of velium in this jar.
That's all there is to it. Please keep the recipe a secret.&quot; She will then
give you a container, Velium Purifier. (No Drop, Expendable)<br>
You say, &quot;What velium vial?&quot;<br>
Frundle Frenkler says, &quot;I'm no potter mind you, but if I remember correctly
it's a small brick of velium, three crystalline silks, and two glass shards.
Then you'll have to finish up by firing it in a kiln with a high quality firing
sheet.&quot;<br>
<br>
(Small piece of velium and small block of velium can be looted on RyGorr
Minors in Crystal Caverns.&nbsp; Crystalline Silk can be found on spiders in the
same zone. So basically, up to here, its rather easy.)&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Velium Vapors Vial:<br>
1) Combine a small (7 lb) brick of velium, three unstacked crystalline silks and
two glass shards in a pottery wheel. You will receive an Unfired Velium Vial.&nbsp;<br>
2) Combine the Unfired Velium Vial and a High Quality firing sheet in the kiln
and receive a Velium Vial (yes they misspelled it in the game).&nbsp;<br>
3) Combine the Velium Vial and two unstacked small pieces of Velium in the
Velium purifier. The Velium Purifier disappears and you are left with a Vial of
Velium Vapors. The vial has one charge of gate to Thurgadin.&nbsp; (And yes, has
been tried &amp; will gate you right to the bridge in Thurgadin.&nbsp; Very nice
item for all that can not port themselves!)&nbsp;<br>
The vial is trivial at skill 130.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
