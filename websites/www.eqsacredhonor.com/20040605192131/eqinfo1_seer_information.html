 The old dwarf looks up at you slowly, his wrinkled hands continuing to carve a small wooden object.  He grins as he eyes your dust-covered outfit and well-used equipment.  'Ahh, a young adventurer,' he says.  'Warms my heart to see the spirit I once had still going strong.  Got too old, you
          see.'  He strokes his beard.  'Tried taking up a [craft], but it just isn't the same.  Sure would be nice to hear some [stories] about those new places I'll never get to see.'<br>
 You say, 'what craft'<br>
          Gram Dunnar stops carving and holds up the object between his short
          fingers.&nbsp; It is a figurine of a swordsman with many intricate
          details.&nbsp; 'No one really wants to buy them, these days.&nbsp; If
          there's no magic in it...' he shrugs.&nbsp; 'Still, something to take
          up some time.'&nbsp; He rummages through some finished pieces on the
          floor around him, picks up one, and tosses it to you.&nbsp; 'Here,' he
          says.&nbsp; 'Maybe it'll bring you some luck.'<br>
 You say, 'I will tell stories'<br>
 Gram listens quietly and nods occasionally as you tell him of your adventures.  'Good stories,' he says.  'Heard 'em before, but still bring back memories.'
