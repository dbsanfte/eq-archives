<p><span class="postcolor"><b><font color="#800000" size="3" face="Tahoma"><span style="background-color: #8CD69C">Yesterday
afternoon/evening (Dec. 8, 2002) we gathered some friends and allies together to
do a couple of reavers in CoM. We took less than 3 full groups in and quickly
dispatched the first wave. We decided to do what we refer to as the 'whole
circuit' (go all the way up and do the 1 reaver at the 'end-of-the-line' in the
floating buildings up the ramps) which we ended up hurrying for because
Darkblood needed Lord Rak (who happened to spawn up the lift on our first cycle)
so if we didn't hurry they would have to kill the reavers we were after to
dispatch their epic mob safely. We levi'd down to find they were clearing to get
to their mob and were already in the main room of the temple (behind the locked
door that is between the gazebos).<br>
This group of Darkblood saw we were ready to fish the reavers and kindly waited
for us to do so... What happened next took everyone by surprise. On the last
reaver pulled from up the lift (you know how when you kill a reaver it can spawn
another reaver?) we got another reaver! And another! And another! and they just
KEPT spawning! And spawning! The Darkblood group (I believe around 10 in
number?) who was there (for Dryzun's epic piece), showed their HONOR by jumping
to the task of handling additional mobs and additional healing while we just
KEPT KILLING one reaver after another!<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
We killed 87 reavers off of ONE pull!<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
After a dozen or so reavers fell Ecclesiastique took the initiative to /petition
this event. We did not wish to take ANY chances of being acused of any
exploiting and we were CYAing all who were there. A guide showed up and watched
another dozen or so go down and then a FULL GM came and watched us kill the
rest. Fatigue and cramps and an overwhelming sense of accomplishment displaced
our adrenaline. I went ahead and pulled the reaver from the front room to SHOW
the GM that the zone was NOT bugged. Only 3 total from THAT reaver!<br>
I asked the FULL GM...<br>

You told Olovf, 'ok, thank you do you know if there is a record soemwhere of the

and his reply..<br>

Olovf tells you, 'No..hehe, I'm pretty sure that was it though'<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
Of the 87 killed we got only TWO Jade Reavers But those 2 JRs will ALWAYS be 2
of MY personal favorites! They were lottoed and went to be given to the
appropriate druid/ranger for that part of their epic quest! WOOT!<br>
Kudos to EVERYONE who helped (those there throughout the entire raid, the couple
who arrived to help after we began, Darkblood (for thier ALL their help) and
those supported us in channels and in spirit! We COULD not have done it
otherwise!<br>

Wanted to post a thanks on DB's board, but they have locked their board to
members only So I emailed it to them. Here is a copy of it:<br>
<br>
<br>
Oh Man!! You all locked your board down to members ONLY! I can't come spam you
all!<br>
<br>
Oh Well. Have a little note I wanted to post to Dryzun. Up to you if you wish to
place it up for view obviously<br>
<br>
Here is a copy of what we have up on our Raid Section from last nights excursion
into COM:<br>
<br>
Sunnys post was inserted here<br>
<br>
I also wanted to add Our deepest Thank You to Dry and the DB compadres that came
to support him and ended up supporting us! We all worked awesome together to
keep everyone alive thru the 87 reavers we ended up killing. The team of DB that
kept Sunny alive for Ecclesiastique, I thank very much as I was 25 mana when the
initial reaver was pulled! And that is MORE than enough usually for a 4 reaver
pop. But not an 87 pop! Our bard got there thankfully to help sing pretty for
me, which gave me enough mana to keep the rest of group alive and rebuff as
needed. Was a wee let down to get only 2 JR's off that. But they did go to
druids that needed them desparately!<br>
<br>
Grats to Dry on his new toy The Spear of Fate. Wish I had the strength to drag
myself back up to Rak to aid!<br>
<br>
Obsian? Can't ya make a little spot for outsiders to post Thank yous or Grats.
And make it clear that it is a NICE place no nasty messages allowed? Just an
Adra thought<br>
<br>
Again, Hats off.<br>
<br>
Adra/Ecc<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
I also want to Thank EVERYONE with us. Rugs did an outstanding job keeping stuff
mezzed and off of us. Everyone pulled together, kept calm and laughed like nuts.<br>
<br>
So who up to do it again? LOL<br>

On another server they got 121 or 127 reavers off one spawn. It's been noted on
both the Glade (ranger forum) and EQ Druids. Sorry it's not a record but most
likely one for our server. Great job.<br>

Was with y'all in spirit, watching over Rug's shoulder as the reavers did their
Energizer Bunny routine... wow! The running total of reavers being called out to
Legion via /gu was provoking a great deal of entertaining conversation as well.<br>
