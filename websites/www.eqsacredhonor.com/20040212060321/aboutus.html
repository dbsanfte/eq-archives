                                                Sacred Honor is constructed of a
                                                council, officers, and members.
                                                The guild is maintained by a
                                                fair balance of power. No ONE
                                                person or group of people have
                                                final say in any situation.<br>
                                                <br>
                                                Sacred Honor's council makes the
                                                bylaws of the Sacred Honor
                                                guild. Council members
                                                constantly review the guild's
                                                bylaws in order to keep the code
                                                fair for all. Council members
                                                also make new positions
                                                available in the officer and
                                                council sections of the guild.
                                                They cannot, however, nominate
                                                or elect the new members to fill
                                                those positions. An individual
                                                may be removed from the council
                                                by majority vote by other
                                                council members, including the
                                                vote of the council member in
                                                question. Council members are
                                                allowed to hold positions as
                                                officers in Sacred Honor. A
                                                council member may willingly
                                                step down in his/her duties as
                                                an titled guild officer (banker,
                                                raid, liaison, etc.) That person
                                                will still remain an officer and
                                                council person with only the
                                                duties of a council member. An
                                                individual may also step down as
                                                a council member and remain an
                                                officer, keeping any duties
                                                he/she had as an officer.
                                                Council members are highly
                                                respected members of Sacred
                                                Honor and hold only the best

                                                heart. Their actions and
                                                commitment are rewarded only by
                                                the satisfaction of knowing
                                                honor, justice, and unity still

                                                Officers effectively RUN the
                                                guild. They make sure the bylaws
                                                of the guild are followed, admit
                                                new members, schedule raids and
                                                participate in the everyday
                                                running of the guild. As new
                                                positions become available,
                                                officers nominate and elect new
                                                officers and new council
                                                members. There are some

                                                officers with duties involved
                                                such as: banker/treasurer, trade
                                                skills, external relations and
                                                so forth. Currently, the names
                                                of these offices are under
                                                revision. A list of what they
                                                are and their job descriptions
                                                will be available on the guild
                                                website. Officers are not
                                                required to take a title, but
                                                their opinions and actions are
                                                invaluable to the operation of
                                                the guild. Sacred Honor's
                                                officers take that extra step
                                                for the greater good of the
                                                guild. Officers give, knowing
                                                there will be no reward. Sacred

                                                greatly to the guild's well
