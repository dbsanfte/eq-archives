<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Rule
#1:&nbsp; No one leaves the spot.&nbsp; Always keep your pulls as far up to the
group as possible to avoid runners.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Rule
#2:&nbsp; If you get feared or teleported.&nbsp; Stand there like you were
coming in for the first time and make sure you have not picked up anything else.&nbsp;
If you have aggroed mobs, die or gate out and the group will let you know when
its safe to try to come back in.&nbsp; DO NoT run throughout the zone, you
may be without your corpse till your puller says it's okay for him to drag it
back to you, which could be a long time.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Rule
#3:&nbsp; No arguing in /ooc about who isn't or is in your group at the time or
what the loot order is. Most important thing at this point right now is killing
about 7-9 mobs.&nbsp; So, if you do die you can come back in safely.&nbsp; Just
keep your mind on the pulling machine and argue in your respective groups till
you are safe and the area is cleared.&nbsp; There is more time to have
conversations later.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Rule
#4:&nbsp; DO NOT succor or evac unless you absolutely have to.&nbsp; Better to
take a few deaths than trying to reinsert all over again.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Rule
#5:&nbsp; Stay close to each other while medding, fighting and waiting for your
puller.&nbsp; No need to aggro stuff.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Rule
#6:&nbsp; You will die.&nbsp; Have that level 46 buffer fully intact!</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Rule
#7:&nbsp; Praying does not help.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Verdana" size="3"><b>THE
FOLLOWING IS A LIST OF RULES &amp; SUGGESTIONS COMMONLY USED FOR RAID PARTIES</b></font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin: 0"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Plane of Fear Rules And
Suggestions<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
1. During the raid, there's NO useless chatter in /shout. Someone not paying
attention could cause the rest of us to get killed and destroy the raid. /shout
will be used to announce mob drops, pulls, etc...<br>
PLEASE! PAY ATTENTION!<br>
<br>
2. Use /ooc for all communication while in PoF. For /group and /say can not be
seen by all raid members. Unless it is just communication within your formed
groups or around you. The puller incoming message and all instructions will be
in /shout.<br>
<br>
3. You must pay attention to the raid organizer at absolutely all times and keep
up with what the Raid Leader or Puller says. If you don't keep up, and you get
left behind, you might:<br>
a) die<br>
b) start a train and kill us all<br>
c) lose your corpse.<br>
All 3 of these options are unacceptable.<br>
<br>
4. Loot will be done ONLY AFTER the fight is over and it is SAFE. The looting
will be done by the group leader, (or who he/she assigns as looter), who's group
took the kill, who will then call what the name of the item is &amp; who it is
for through /shout. Those classes that can use the item are the ONLY ones that
will roll for the item, unless it is NOT a NO DROP item. Then Raid Leader will
announce who will lotto item. The looting on non no drops will be announced
later. We will roll with /random whatever Raid Leader says. The one who wins
will loot their item.<br>
<br>
5. There will be no bickering or arguing about anything, including loot. The
raid leader's say is final. This is YVON.<br>
<br>
6. There will be one person assigned as the puller. To make it as easy as
possible, create a hotkey that says &quot;/assist &quot;. Keep hitting that
hotkey as soon as the puller says that a target has been acquired. Puller will
have a hotkey made for INCOMING.<br>
<br>
7. No extended periods of AFK. You have run to the little Norrath's Room? Go
before hand or while we are taking a med break. Need to walk the dog? Walk the
dog before hand. You need to go hang out with the wife/girlfriend? Put her to
bed before hand. And holding up 30+ people for your laundry just is not cool
either.<br>
<br>
8. If you dont like the rules of a raid please do not come, because if you don't
like the rules, but come anyway and then bicker about them, you will be asked to
leave. If you feel we are too tight, strict, etc... about these rules, sorry,
but we have found that it works well and everyone knows what is going on.<br>
<br>
9. Trouble makers will be asked to leave the raid. Trouble makers consist of
people that complain, whine, argue, loot without winning a lotto and/or just
cause problems in general. We understand that people can have bad days, shoot
for this not to be one of those bad days!<br>
<br>
10. There will be no talking while raid, group leaders or puller is giving
instructions, idle chatter is spam and can be distracting to a raid, group
leader, puller or another member. Distractions can and will kill. Suggestion...
Make your /shout in a very eye catching color, as to always see it! Also, if you
turn off /auctions, misses, others hits, others misses, this will cut down the
amount of lines scrolling by at the speed of cheetah!<br>
<br>
11. This is not an experience raid, it is a learning and hopefully really cool
loot raid. If you plan on going and getting exp. Don't come. The odds of dying
at least once are 99%. We will have clerics on hand, but one never knows what to
expect.<br>
<br>
12. You need to be close to getting Level 47. Please do not come if one kill
will knock you into 45. For a cleric CAN NOT rez you back if you will not
re-ding
to 46, until you have regained a kill or two or three or four... back towards
46. You will have to fight naked, due to a 49 level rez being not a 100% rez. An
example here: Adrastea achieved level 51, killed 3 more mobs for a SMALL buffer,
stopped fighting and went to PoF, she died 5 times in Fear. And each time lost
the level, but regained it after ever rez. If the small buffer was not there,
she would have not re-dinged into the level each time. Not a happy thought to
her, but a risk she was willing to take. Had this have been level 46, and no
buffer, would not have been a pretty sight!<br>
<br>
13. Do not move from a camp until the puller and raid leader have announced it
is safe to do so. Doing so will get us all wiped out. Which means... no
exploring. This is NOT the zone to explore, for you WILL aggro MOBS and then we
all DIE.<br>
<br>
14. Getting ported or feared by mobs. There is only one rule.<br>
DO NOT TRAIN THE CAMP<br>
Die.<br>
Die horrible.<br>
Or if you can Camp. Camp quickly. Whatever it is. If you have ANY... even the
slightest idea of whether you have aggroed something... You sit where you are
and camp.<br>
Casters feel free to gate... Tanks feel free to try to camp.<br>
There is no place we can't get your corpse back from with a necromancer or
shadowknight. But killing everyone is a travesty. Not to mention the down time
for all the rezzes.<br>
It is better to have a few people die in random spots and win the fight than
kill everyone.<br>
Again</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin: 0"><font face="Verdana" size="2"> DO NOT TRAIN THE CAMP.<br>
DO NOT COME BACK - WE DON'T WANT YOU.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin: 0"><font face="Verdana" size="2"> At least not till the aggro is gone.<br>
Sorry about repeating this, but it can not be stressed enough.<br>
<br>
15. Everyone needs to have Magic Resistant Buff up at all times.<br>
<br>
16. If someone tells you to consent them. Don't ask questions, don't
&quot;think&quot; about it, just Do it IMMEDIATELY.<br>
It means they have a window of opportunity to drag your corpse somewhere safe,
but they must do it quick or they too will die.<br>
So, please read all messages in /ooc, /shout, /group, /guild, or /tell.<br>
<br>
17. Have a /loc hotkey made. Make sure you hit it as you are attempting not to
die. This way you know exactly where you died.<br>
If it is in an area that a corpse can be drug from, this will be USEFUL
information!<br>
<br>
18. All members of the raid need to have a coffin on them. DO NOT expect your
friendly neighborhood necromancer or shadowknight to be carrying one for you.<br>
Warning: It takes up an inventory slot and weighs 10 stone.<br>
<br>
19. Be kind to our clerics &amp; enchanters, bring a stack of Peridots for them.
They are costly and if you expect them to cast these buffs on you, it would be
nice to keep them supplied.<br>
<br>
20. The Raid Leader is in charge of forming groups. He will assign the Group
Leader and tell him/her who is in their group and /shout it out. Every group
will be as balanced as possible. There will be change ups as the raid goes, so
don't be alarmed if you see &quot;Raid Coordinator shouts, YourName join
BabbleAlong's group!<br>
<br>
21. The Frogs fear... I read somewhere a really COOL trick! If you are able...
SNARE yourself, this will keep you from going more than 5-10 feet! And ALWAYS!!!
ALWAYS!!! Keep the WALK ON! Except when moving to new camp site!<br>
<br>
22. Stock up your food &amp; drink. There are NO vendors in PoF!<br>
<br>
23. Stay near your group members, a few good reasons here... Your healer can
heal you easier, the buffers can buff easier &amp; group buff spells have a
moderately small casting range.<br>
<br>
24. The rules can change a little as we go, SOME are NOT set in stone and Yvon
may switch things up as we go. All will be advised of changes.<br>
<br>
25. If you bind in PoF... Only bind on the North Wall. If for some reason you
change it to another place in PoF, so you can TP out and back, change your bind
spot upon returning ASAP! This is VERY important. No where in the zone is
&quot;safe&quot; except the North Wall for binding.<br>
<br>
27. Many things see through invisibility.<br>
<br>
28. THE FIREWALL - Unless you like painful deaths - DO NOT GO THROUGH THE RING
OF FIRE! If you get feared and end up inside the firewall, do a 360 degree turn,
make sure you have NOT aggroed anything and then come out of the firewall. Then
STOP and do that 360 degree turn again! Please ask in /shout if you should camp
out cause you were feared beyond the firewall! Raid Leader will make judgment call. If he says &quot;YES&quot;. Camp IMMEDIATELY!</font></p>
