                        During the raid, there's NO useless chatter during
                        pulls. Someone not paying attention could cause the rest
                        of us to get killed and destroy the raid.<br>
                        PAY ATTENTION!<br>
                        <br>
                        2. No extended periods of AFK. You have run to the
                        little Norrath's Room? Go before hand or while we are
                        taking a med break. Need to walk the dog? Walk the dog
                        before hand. You need to go hang out with the
                        wife/girlfriend? Put her to bed before hand. And holding
                        up your group for your laundry just is not cool either.<br>
                        <br>
                        3. You must pay attention to the raid organizer at
                        absolutely all times and keep up with what the Raid
                        Leader or Puller says. If you don't keep up, and you get
                        left behind, you might:<br>
                        a) die<br>
                        b) start a train and kill us all<br>
                        c) lose your corpse.<br>
                        All 3 of these options are unacceptable.<br>
                        <br>
                        4. Loot will be done AFTER the fight is over and it is
                        SAFE, for EVERYONE who can use the item ONLY. It will be
                        done by the group leader who's group took the kill, if
                        there is more than one group, who will then call what
                        the name of the item is. Those classes will roll with
                        /random whatever Raid Leader says. The one who wins will
                        loot their item.<br>
                        <br>
                        5. Allies and all individuals listed as &quot;Friends&quot; have
                        the same equal looting rights on all items. Guests will
                        have no looting rights, unless stating so prior to the
                        Raid.<br>
                        <br>
                        6. There will be no bickering or arguing about anything,
                        including loot. The raid leader's say is final.<br>
                        <br>
                        7. There will be one person assigned as the puller. To
                        make it as easy as possible, create a hotkey that says
                        &quot;/assist &lt;First name of assist person&gt;&quot;.
                        Keep hitting that hotkey as soon as the puller says that
                        a target has been aquired. Puller, make sure you have a
                        hotkey made for INCOMING.<br>
                        <br>
                        8. If you dont like the rules of a raid please do not
                        come, because if you don't like the rules, but come
                        anyway and then bicker about them, you will be asked to
                        leave. If you feel we are too tight, strict, etc...
                        about these rules, sorry, but we have found that it
                        works well and everyone knows what is going on.<br>
                        <br>
                        9. Trouble makers will be asked to leave the raid.
                        Trouble makers consist of people that complain, whine,
                        argue, loot without winning a lotto and/or just cause
                        problems in general. We understand that people can have
                        bad days, shoot for the raid day to not be one of those
                        bad days!<br>
                        <br>
                        10. There will be no talking while raid, group leaders
                        or puller is giving instructions, idle chatter is spam
                        and can be distracting to a raid, group leader, puller
                        or another member. Distractions will kill.<br>
                        <br>
                        11. Do not move from a camp until the puller and raid
                        leader have announced it is safe to do so. Doing so can
                        get us all wiped out. Which means... no exploring.<br>
                        <br>
                        12. Everyone needs to have Magic Resistant Buff up at
                        all times if we are raiding where there are casting
                        mobs.<br>
                        <br>
                        13. If someone tells you to consent them. Do it
                        IMMEDIATELY.<br>
                        It means they have a window of opportunity to drag your
                        corpse somewhere safe, but they must do it quick or they
                        too can die.<br>
                        So, please read all messages.<br>
                        <br>
                        14. Have a /loc hotkey made. Make sure you hit it as you
                        are attempting not to die. This way you know exactly
                        where you died.<br>
                        If it is in an area that a corpse can be drug from, this
                        will be USEFUL information!<br>
                        <br>
                        15. Be kind to our clerics &amp; enchanters, bring a few
                        peridots or whatever gem they need, if you want them to
                        cast these buffs on you, just a nice thing to do.<br>
                        <br>
                        16. The Raid Leader is in charge of forming groups. He
                        will assign the Group Leader and tell him/her who is in
                        their group. Every group will be as balanced as
                        possible. There may be change ups as the raid goes, so
                        don't be alarmed if you see &quot;RaidCoordinator
                        shouts, YourName join BabbleAlong's group!<br>
                        <br>
                        17. Upon entering the zone, put on your LFG tag!!! /lfg
                        This will enable Raid Leader to see you NEED a group. Be
                        patient, Raid Leader will have to shuffle a bit to get
                        you grouped and may take a few minutes if there is more
                        than one group on raid. Stay close to raid party to
                        ensure you don't get killed while waiting to be grouped.<br>
                        <br>
                        18. Have food &amp; drink. Just a thought, don't want
                        anyone starving to death! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) -->

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        19. Stay near your group members, a few good reasons
                        here... Your healer can heal you easier, the buffers can
                        buff easier &amp; group buff spells have a moderate
                        casting range. Not to mention... We really don't want
                        you out wandering and dragging MOB's back with you!<br>
                        <br>
                        20. The rules can change a little as we go, SOME are NOT
                        set in stone and raid leader may switch things up as we
                        go. All will be advised of changes.<br>
                        <br>
                        21. Bind in a safe spot, ask if you don't know.<br>
                        <br>
                        22. Give a pull or two of notice if you have to log.</font></b></td>
