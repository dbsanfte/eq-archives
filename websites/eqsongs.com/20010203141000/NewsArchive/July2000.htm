            <font face="Verdana,Arial" size="2">Ok, after running several tests,
            here's what I've come up with:<br>
            <br>
            The DoT/Regen nerf does NOT affect us. It only affects us if we DoT
            ourselves, and even then it only affects Hymn. Niv's still works. I
            ran over to Skyfire and had a chromadrac blood boil me, zoned, and I
            was able to start Hymn just fine. Congratulations to Verant for
            finally thinking about us before they put in a change.<br>
            <br>
            Haste is working the same as ever. My PoS haste belt had the same
            haste it's always had, which means they either forgot to upgrade the
            bard belt haste, or they were talking about different haste belts
            entirely (I've heard you can get better ones via quests deeper in
            PoS). But if I played Verses with my belt, I was hasted up to about
            83%, which is right around the haste % I got last level and far in
            excess of belt haste (16%) + Verses haste (30%).<br>
            <br>
            Chain is still broken. I beat a goblin down to 40%, it started to
            run, Chained it, and it kept right on running. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( -->

    <p>7/20 9:15am - Well, it looks like we got hit by another ICBM Nerf nuke
    last night.&nbsp; To fix an exploit, some&nbsp; people where using DoTs to
    stack regeneration spells that normally do not stack, they have made it so
    if you are DoT'd no regen spells will take hold.&nbsp; This includes all
    three of our regen songs (<a href="http://eqsongs.com/Songs/Song06.htm">Hymn

    Kaearia has started a <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/062919.html">thread
    on the Whineplay forum</a>.<br>
    <br>
    Addendum: It appears not all DoTs are blocking regeneration spells.&nbsp;
    Early reports say that some poison &amp; magic based DoTs are allowing the
    songs to take hold.&nbsp; I will try to get a list of the ones that block as
    soon as possible.</p>

    <p align="left">7/19 12:30pm - Patch Day! Nothing bard specific but a
    important none the less:July 19th, 7:00am<br>
    -----------------<br>
    ***Patch Day***<br>
    <br>
    *Miscellaneous Changes/Fixes*<br>
    - The &quot;Safe Points&quot; have been moved in Field of Bone and Lake of
    Ill Omen to someplace &quot;safer&quot;.<br>
    - You can no longer cast invisibility on any pet.&nbsp;<br>
    - Foul language issued through /emote will now be handled by the profanity
    filter.<br>
    - Corrected a bug that allowed linkdead players to walk through locked
    doors.<br>
    - Rangers above level 50 will now do double damage with Archery against
    non-moving, non-rooted targets. These restrictions allowed us to enhance
    archery without creating a new kiting problem.<br>
    - Corrected a bug that had rangers doing less melee damage than was intended
    except when fighting an NPC who was also a ranger.<br>
    - Pets, both PC and NPC, will no longer cast &quot;Gate&quot;.<br>
    - A large rat says, &quot;Hit by non-melee for XXX damage&quot;, is history.
    The new message given probably isn't the source of never-ending humor that
    the old one was.<br>
    - Updated pathing information in Innothule Swamp.<br>
    - Corrected many, many, MANY spelling and grammar errors in the world.<br>
    - Fixed a large number of spell gems and spellbook icons. Take care to take
    a look at your spell lineup to familiarize yourself with the new gems/icons.<br>
    <br>
    *Poison*<br>
    - Implemented the high level Rogue poisons (level 51+).<br>
    - Increased Rogue &quot;Make Poison&quot; skill cap.<br>
    - Substantially reduced chance to fail &quot;Apply Poison&quot;.<br>
    - Rogues will now automatically sit when right-clicking on a poison.<br>
    - Failure to make a poison will now return the vial.<br>
    <br>
    *General Crafts*<br>
    - The Ant's Potion may now be used anywhere.<br>
    - The small and large reinforced wristband may now be crafted.<br>
    - The small and medium studded shoulderpads, cloak, and belt may now be
    crafted.<br>
    - The medium reinforced mask may now be crafted.<br>
    - Sealed Poison Vials can now be crafted.<br>
    - The Thermal Cloak may now be tinkered.<br>
    - The &quot;This item is trivial...&quot; message in craft skills has been
    replaced with &quot;You can no longer advance in skill from making this
    item&quot;.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    *Items*<br>
    - The Elven Paladin Newbie Tunic may now be worn by Half Elf paladins.<br>
    - The Murky Vial will now properly affect the target instead of the player.<br>
    - Increased stats on many Plane of Sky items.<br>
    - There was evidently more than one &quot;Fine Steel Dagger&quot; running
    around in the world. Some of them have been renamed &quot;Serpant's
    Tooth&quot;.<br>
    - The effect on the Staff of Undead Legions has been changed to something a
    bit more useful.<br>
    - The Deepwater Helm now has a significant casting time. The function of its
    spell allowed a mana-free heal even though it was intended to be a buff.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    */consent*<br>
    Some people were spamming others with /consent, causing them to disconnect.
    As a result, /consent can now only be done once every two seconds. Should
    you be harassed via this tool, please use /report. Also,&nbsp; please take
    care to avoid accidentally /consenting someone, as it will be two seconds
    before you can undo it.<br>
    <br>
    *Cazic-Thule and the Feerrott*<br>
    There has been a significant change to the factions in the Feerrott and
    Cazic-Thule. Take care not to get killed by NPCs that previously left you
    alone. The significant upside to this change is that the &quot;Cazic
    Gate/Portal&quot; can be made much safer in nature for those who work on
    their faction.<br>
    <br>
    *Regen Effects*<br>
    This week we corrected a bug that caused regen-type spells (e.g.
    Regeneration, Chloroplast, Regrowth, etc.) to overwrite DOT spells. As a
    result of this fix, players can no longer accept a regeneration spell while
    under the effect of a DOT. However, if the regen spell is already in place,
    the DOT will stack, but not replace the regen spell. This will allow users
    of<br>
    beneficial DOTs, such as Call of Bones, to continue using their DOT while
    under the affect of regen.<br>
    <br>
    *Keyed Dungeons*<br>
    The key for Charasis (Howling Stones) is now NODROP per the patch message
    from a couple of weeks ago. Furthermore, when your character dies, keys for
    Charasis, Sebilis, and Veeshan's Peak, will no longer<br>
    remain with your corpse, but will instead return with your character to its
    bind point. We made this change to reduce the difficulty and corpse-loss
    potential of these zones, and eliminate the need to do the key quests
    multiple times.<br>
    <br>
    *Barbed Scale Whip*<br>
    In the last item patch, this item was changed from its original stats to
    something inferior, as the game designer was not aware that it was already
    in-game. It has been changed back to its original stats.<br>
    <br>
    *Hiding Corpses*<br>
    A new command has been implemented in the EverQuest client. This command (/hidecorpses)
    allows players to suppress the display of player and NPC corpses on the
    screen. This can be very useful once you've entered a zone with a large
    number of corpes, causing framerate to decay. It will be particularly useful
    in the planes. The command supports the following arguments:<br>
    <br>
    - ALL: Hides all corpses except yours.<br>
    - ALLBUTGROUP: Hides all corpses except yours and those of people in your
    group.<br>
    - NONE: No longer hides corpses.<br>
    <br>
    For community reasons, this option must be set after entering each zone, and
    will not affect corpses made after you enter the zone. You can reset it
    while in the zone in order to suppress display of corpses made since you
    originally set it.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    *Resurrection*<br>
    The resurrection confirmation box will now report the name of the person
    casting the spell as well as what spell they are casting. Furthermore,
    experience will not be &quot;removed&quot; from your corpse until you accept
    the resurrection by choosing YES. Previously, any resurrection spell, if
    declined, would cause the experience to be unrecoverable.<br>

            Ok, for the post 50 charm line of spells.
            <p>They work different on Kunark then they do on Norrath. They are
            made so you cannot charm creatures higher then level 52 on Norrath.
            They do however work on much higher creatures in Kunark. That's all
            the info I can provide.

            I have battled the Iksar Exiles (about level 27 npcs) in Warslilks
            woods and they ALWAYS resist charm. I have also confirmed with other
            Enchanters of level 50+ that have been completely unable to charm
            even the lowest level Iksar npcs.
            <p>Is this intentional? Or a bug?
            <p>If it is intentional, may I humbly request a message other than
            resist be activated when you attempt to charm the Iksar.
            <p>If I had heard:<br>
            &quot;Your spell has no effect on this creature&quot;<br>
            instead of the basic resist message then I wouldn't have died nearly

    was in a group with a wizzie, who complained that the Psalm of Warmth
    negated his Greater Shielding. There was no mention of this on your site,
    PLUS I laughed at him for preferring a solo-buff as a tank over a group buff
    for all. he admitted that the song was preferable, but still thought the
    bard community should be aware of this &quot;fact&quot;.<br>
    <br>
