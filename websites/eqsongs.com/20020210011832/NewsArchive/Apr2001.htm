    <p><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2">October 8th, 3:00 am<br>
    ------------------------------<br>
    <br>
    *** Item Changes ***<br>
    <br>
    <b>- Increased the duration on Song of the Deep Seas (the proc on a bardic
    weapon) dramatically.</b><br>
    <br>
    - Modified the effect of Feast of Blood (weapon proc) it is now a DoT
    lifetap<br>
    <br>
    - Added a texture to Flayed Barbarian Skin Leggings.<br>
    <br>
    <b>- Added Illusion: Barbarian to the Flayed Barbarian Hide Mask.</b><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    *** Miscellaneous Changes ***<br>
    <br>
    - The last language used by your character will be stored in your
    eqclient.ini file when you log out. This means that if the last character
    you were playing was speaking Elvish, then when you log back in with any
    character, that character will be speaking Elvish if he can, otherwise it
    will be set to a default language (most often Common).<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    *** Magic System Changes ***<br>
    <br>
    There is a more detailed explanation of these changes posted on our
    Developer's Corner. Please visit there for more details (either at <a href="http://www.everquest.com" target="_blank">www.everquest.com</a>
    or <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/cgi-bin/Ultimate.cgi" target="_blank">http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/...in/Ultimate.cgi</a>).
    Here is a summary of the changes:<br>
    <br>
    - The level-based spell resistance bonus inherent in super-high level NPCs
    has been reduced significantly.<br>
    <br>
    - Several NPCs have had their resistances reduced. Each of them was examined
    carefully, and resistances changed as seemed appropriate. For some of these
    NPCs other things were changed as well to compensate for their increased
    susceptibility to spells, such as armor improvements or perhaps greater hit
    points, if needed for that NPC.<br>
    <br>
    - NPCs that were highly magic resistant in order to make them immune to
    certain spells can now be given specific immunity to those spells. This
    means that they can be made immune to critical spells, as intended, and
    still be generally less resistant to magic. Players will receive a message
    similar to the one that is already given for Mesmerization spells when they
    cast a spell on an NPC that it is specifically immune to.<br>
    <br>
    IMPORTANT NOTE: It is very important to note that we have not made any NPCs
    immune to spells that they were not already immune to. Many NPCs that were
    previously immune to spells due to their high innate resistance to magic
    have had that resistance reduced and specific immunities added. So if you
    see an immunity message after attempting to cast a spell on an NPC that you
    hadn't seen such a message from before, understand that the NPC was already
    immune to that spell before due to high resistances, and the only difference
    is that it now has lower resistances in general and specific spell immunity
    (which is why you are seeing the message).<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    *** Melee Changes ***<br>
    <br>
    After extensive research, testing, and evaluation we have completed the
    melee portion of our class balancing. To be clear, these changes apply just
    to the combat aspect of melee classes. Any issues with non-combat skills,
    spell effects, spell selection, or non-combat aspects of classes will be
    evaluated in the near future. With the completion of the melee combat
    balancing, we will be moving onto spells and spell casting classes.<br>
    <br>
    Due to the extensive nature of these changes, we can't describe them in
    detail here. A detailed summary will be available on our Developer's Corner
    message board. Please visit <a href="http://www.everquest.com" target="_blank">www.everquest.com</a>
    and our forums for more information.<br>
    <br>
    * Summary of Melee Changes *<br>
    <br>
    - Two-Handed Weapons have been given an increased damage bonus for
    characters over level 50. Also, certain post-epic quality two-handers have
    been improved.<br>
    <br>
    - Warriors have had their taunt skill cap increased to 230 at 60th level.
    Also, the Blades of Strategy and Tactics can now be used in either hand.<br>
    <br>
    - Rogues, as the primary user of piercing weapons, will benefit from an
    improvement in the quality of a few existing high-end daggers. At some
    future date new piercing weapons will be added to the game to fill gaps in
    equipment availability.<br>
    <br>
    - Monks will now be on an improved combat table at levels 55 and again to a
    better table at 60. Monks now have the ability to Triple Attack at 60th
    level. The minimum damage done by Flying Kick will be greatly increased for
    monks starting at 51st level and scaling up to level 60. We also intend to
    add more monk weapons in the future to fill equipment gaps.<br>
    <br>
    - Rangers have their Double Attack skill cap raised to 245. They have also
    gained an innate offensive bonus that starts at level 55 and increases until
    level 60. Ranger's Defense skill cap has been raised to 220, and their
    Riposte skill cap has been raised to 185.<br>
    <br>
    - Paladins and Shadowknights, besides the benefits they gain from the
    two-handed weapons change mentioned above, have also been moved to the same
    combat tables as warriors. In the future we intend to examine the existing
    one-handed weapons useable by knights for possible upgrades. We are also
    increasing the Taunt skill cap for these two classes to 220.<br>
    <br>
    <b>- Bards have had their 1h blunt and 1h slash skill caps increased to 250.
    Their piercing skill cap has been increased to 240. Their Offense skill cap
    has been raised to 252. Bards are also being moved to the same combat table
    with all the other melee and hybrid classes (save monks who have separate
    tables after level 55). Bards Parry skill cap has been raised to 185 as
    well. Finally, the Singing Shortsword can now be equipped in the off hand
    and still give full song enhancing benefits.</b><br>
    <br>
    Please read the detailed explanation of these changes on our Developer's
    Corner message boards at <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/cgi-bin/Ultimate.cgi" target="_blank">http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/...in/Ultimate.cgi</a><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    *** Firiona Vie (Roleplaying Preferred) server goes Live ***<br>
    <br>
    Our newest special rules server is now available. Firiona Vie is designated
    as roleplaying preferred. There are many special rules for this server,
    please read over them carefully before playing. We will be keeping an
    updated list of these rules on our web site at <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/guidebook/firionavie.jsp" target="_blank">http://everquest.station.sony.com/g.../firionavie.jsp</a>
    .<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    ** Firiona Vie Server Feature List **<br>
    <br>
    - This is a new server, not a split server. Nor will there be any transfers
    to this server.<br>
    - Characters will be wiped before the server goes Live.<br>
    - This is a PvE (Player vs. Environment) server, NOT a PvP (Player vs.
    Player) server. In other words, it's a standard 'blue' server with the same
    rules and features regarding PvP as the vast majority of our servers. It is
    not one of the 'Zeks'.<br>
    - Auction restricted to city zones: Qeynos, Surefall Glade, Highkeep,
    Freeport, Rivervale, Erudin, Halas, Neriak, Grobb, Oggok, Greater Faydark,
    Ak'Anon, Kaladim, Felwithe, Paineel, Cabilis, Kael and Thurgadin.<br>
    - Beneficial buff spells will not work on characters 20 levels lower than
    the caster.<br>
    - Each character will be assigned an &quot;alignment&quot; upon creation.
    This alignment will be described in brief on the character creation screen
    (in the same location that their Deity is described).<br>
    - Each character will be able to change their alignment once any time after
    they reach 10th level if they choose. A character is not required to change
    alignments, but may do so any time after attaining 10th level. The player
    will be able to chose from a list of alignments based on their race, class
    and deity.<br>
    - A character's alignment will determine whether or not they can group with
    other characters.<br>
    - A character's alignment will determine an experience bonus or penalty when
    grouping with other characters.<br>
    - A character's alignment will determine if they can cast beneficial spells
    on other characters (including resurrections).<br>
    - Language skills will improve only through group chat in the same zone and
    from /say.<br>
    - Languages will only improve 1 point each hour and will be capped at
    level*5+5 skill points.<br>
    - Common will not exist. A Human language will be added and only made easily
    available to certain races.<br>
    - One character per account.<br>
    - The Trivial Loot Code will be in effect in all zones.<br>
    - Very few items will be No-Drop. Exceptions will include things such as
    newbie notes and epic weapons.<br>
    - Bind Affinity will be restricted for all characters to locations where
    melee characters can bind on other servers.<br>
    - /emote will be language specific<br>
    - All characters will be /roleplay.<br>
    - /alignment will display the alignment of your character and probably a
    more detailed description of that alignment.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    ** Trivial Loot Code **<br>
    <br>
    Briefly, the Trivial Loot Code works like this: If a character kills an NPC
    and that NPC does not give them experience, then the Trivial Loot Code takes
    effect. If any member of a group does not get experience for a kill, the
    Trivial Loot Code will take effect. The Trivial Loot Code prevents magical,
    lore and no-drop items from appearing on the corpse. Normal items and coins
    will appear on the corpse in all cases as usual.<br>
    <br>
    <br>

    server, please visit our web site: <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/guidebook/firionavie.jsp" target="_blank">http://everquest.station.sony.com/g.../firionavie.jsp</a><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    ** NOTE **<br>
    <br>
    Boisterous shouts can be heard across the lands as carriers herald the
    arrival of the latest volume of their city's newspapers. Citizens rush to
    get a copy of these publications to read the featured articles, latest
    gossip, and community news for their hometowns.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    ** A Tale from Norrath **<br>
    <br>
    Adventurers, glory seekers, and plunder-hungry knaves,<br>
    <br>
    A few new tavern tales have been circulating from across the Deep. It
    appears that strife and civil unrest have once again plagued the lands of
    Kunark. Stories of treachery and terror within the ranks of the Sarnak have
    spilled forth from the mountain fortress of Chardok.<br>
    <br>
    Only a few of the most cunning spies have made their way into the Sarnak
    hive during this brief time of turmoil, and their reports may have serious
    implications. The Brood of Di`zok seems to be more organized than before.
    Their leadership is becoming more structured... and much more brutal.
    Production in the mines appears to be increasing and soldiers have been
    amassing in great numbers.<br>
    <br>
    Other tales have come from this mountain fortress as well. Terror squads and
    interrogators have decimated the ranks of reported Sarnak traitors. These
    squads have been working under the leadership of one of the Sarnak
    Collective's newest council members, Korucust. It can only be presumed that
    this cleansing is another step towards strengthening the foul brood.<br>
    <br>
    These tales are hard to confirm, since many of your adventurous kind are
    prone to drink and to the occasional mistruth. If these tales are true, it
    would only stand to reason that new dangers may reveal new wealth and glory.
    Perhaps it is time for you to gather your best gear, finish your mug of ale,
    and head out to investigate.<br>
    <br>
    Good luck adventurers.<br>

    September 18th, 6:00pm<br>
    -------------------------<br>
    <br>
    ** Melee changes **<br>
    <br>
    We're wrapping up an extensive look at the way that melee works in EverQuest.
    These changes are appearing now on Test (in fact, most of them are working
    as of right now). We wanted to make you aware of these changes in some
    detail so that you can give us the feedback that we need on them. Please try
    these changes out and comment on results that you've seen.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    * Melee Tables *<br>
    <br>
    Melee combat is based, at least in part, on tables that determines how each
    class functions. Up until 50th level melee and hybrid classes are on the
    same table, with the exception being monks who are on a separate table (one
    that has them doing more damage). At 50th level warriors, rogues and rangers
    were all moved to the monk table along with the monk, who did not receive a
    new separate table.<br>
    <br>
    The problem here is that post 50th level the disparity between these two
    tables, combined with lower combat abilities for the hybrids as well as a
    more restricted selection of weapons acted as a double (almost triple)
    penalty, making them less effective in combat than was really intended.<br>
    <br>
    Therefore, all melee and hybrid classes will be basing their combat off the
    melee table once they reach 51st level. This should increase the combat
    effectiveness of hybrids noticeably.<br>
    <br>
    Monks, however, are intended to be somewhat better at dealing out damage in
    combat than warriors. To slightly improve their combat prowess they will be
    working from an improved combat table once they reach 55th level and again
    at 60th level. This will improve the combat ability of monks somewhat,
    essentially placing them a half a step ahead of everyone else in toe-to-toe
    combat in the same way that they were prior to 50th level. The rogue will
    still maintain a margin of superiority when you consider their ability to
    backstab.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    * Two-Handed Weapons *<br>
    <br>
    The effectiveness of these weapons falls slightly below our desire for them.
    This tends to make those that rely on them most often (shadowknights and
    paladins) also fall slightly behind our desires for their damage output, at
    least at levels beyond 50. We'd also like to see a broader range of weapons
    used by higher level warriors, and it would be nice to see two-handers as a
    more viable option.<br>
    <br>
    Therefore, we will be increasing the minimum damage of these weapons for all
    classes once they reach 50th level. There will be an increase in the minimum
    damage of two-handed weapons based on the wielder's level and delay of the
    weapon. The higher level the character and the larger the delay, the bigger
    the bonus. Obviously we're not going to give out exact numbers, but this
    should result in a solid increase in damage output when using two-handed
    weapons.<br>
    <br>
    We also believe that there has been a bit of disparity between the very
    high-end one-handed weapons and their counterpart two-handed weapons. The
    ultra-high end one-handed weapons are comparatively better than their
    two-handed counterparts. We will, on a case by case basis, be improving many
    of the high-end two-handed weapons. Because this is essentially a fix for an
    oversight on our parts, we will be making these changes retroactive (meaning
    you won't have to trade the items in or hunt for new ones, existing weapons
    will just change).<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    * Rangers *<br>
    <br>
    We've also noticed that rangers, while intended to be hit harder in combat
    than other melee/hybrid classes, are getting hit harder than we planned.
    Again, this only happens in the 50+ level range. So we will be increasing
    the defense cap for rangers again slightly to 210 at 60th level. Exactly how
    these points will be distributed is uncertain, but probably just one point
    per level after 50. We will also be giving rangers triple attack.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    * Monks *<br>
    <br>
    Monks will be getting triple attack. This along with the improvement of
    their combat tables should place them about where we want them, combat-wise.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>
    * Bards *<br>
    <br>
    Bards are indeed intended to have the least ability to deal damage
    physically of all the classes we're discussing. However, with their lack of
    double attack they didn't meet even our intentions for their damage output.
    We will, therefore, be raising the offense and one-handed weapon caps for
    bards over 50th level to match that of warriors. This should place their
    ability to do damage by means of melee within our intended range without
    making them more effective than the knights at any given level, since double
    attack is a potent melee skill that bards do not get.</b><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Obviously we want to see how this all pans out when applied to the game.
    Feel free to send your comments on the results you see to us through the
    Developer's Corner on our web site, or contact our staff if you see them on
    the Test Server.<br>
    <br>
    It is very important that you understand that these are changes that we are
    testing. These changes (and any others made on the Test Server) may not be
    moved to Live Servers. After all, that's the reason we're testing them.</font><!--mstheme--></font><!--msthemelist--></td></tr>

            looking into. I can't really tell you much more than that right now,
            but it's being looked at.
            <p>As for the Choke Line and the Shaman epic. currently these two
            spells never stack. If the stronger spell is applied first you will
            get a &quot;your spell did not take hold&quot; message. If the
            weaker version is applied first you will not get a message but the
            weaker spell will be overwritten. That being said, I will try to
            rectify this conflict by the next patch.
            <p>Thanks for the feedback.
            <p>- Lawrence Poe

    always to be feared change to spell system that is certain to have broken
    several bard songs &lt;grin&gt;.&nbsp; Here it is:
    <p>*** Patch Message ***<br>
    <br>
    ** Zone Changes **<br>
    - Runnyeye has been changed. Something is up in Goblin land...
    <p><br>
    ** Spell and Song Changes and Bug Fixes **<br>
    <b>- We've been fixing holes in the spell stacking code. For the most part
    the changes fix bugs that allowed tricks to get spells to stack that were
    never intended to stack.</b>
    <p><b>- Increased duration on Bard Charm songs to 18 seconds from 12
    seconds.</b>
    <p>- Fixed the Spell Scroll for Imbue Amber so that Erudite Clerics of Cazic
    Thule can scribe it.
    <p>- The casting messages for Necromancer pet summoning spells have been
    changed to be more appropriate.
    <p>** Features and Interface Changes **<br>
    - The variable %t will now work with /assist. So you can use /assist %t if
    you wish. Though it should have exactly the same effect as /assist without
    the %t.
    <p>- %r returns &quot;corpse&quot; for corpses and &quot;NPC&quot; for
    targeted NPCs.
    <p>- Sense traps failure message text color has been changed to user color
    15 (same as other skill messages). The success message was already set to
    user color 15.
    <p>- Ignore Lists now work the same way that the Friends List does. It has
    been expanded to 30 names per character per server. The new ignore list is
    stored in the same ini file as the friends list (&lt;character
    name&gt;_&lt;#&gt;.ini). The first time a character is created or<br>
    loaded after the patch their new ignore list will be a copy of the old
    ignore list, but will from then on be unique to the character.
    <p>- The Alt key now works in several new situations. It will now show item
    names when in the trade window. Because the trade items of the local player
    and the trading partner are so close together, the item names of the trading
    partner will always show up unless the player positions their mouse pointer
    over the local player part of the trade window, which will cause the game to
    only show the local player's trade item names.
    <p>- The Alt key will show item names for items in your bank.
    <p>- The Alt key will also pop up names for merchant items and corpse items
    when you hold it down in merchant mode or loot mode.
    <p>- The Alt key will even pop up names for items in open containers when
    held down and the mouse cursor is over the open container window (they don't
    show up otherwise).
    <p>- The client will now automatically reject a /duel request from any
    player that is on your /ignore list. Some players were using this<br>
    to annoy players that had ignored them.
    <p>- You also will no longer see /consent messages from people that are on
    your /ignore list (this was also something people were doing to annoy people
    that had ignored them).
    <p>- /who GUILD (and the GUILD must be in caps) will now show you the
    members of your guild in your zone. You can also specify a guild name, such
    as /who &quot;Irontoe Brigade&quot;.
    <p>- /safelock command added. /safelock will lock the EverQuest interface
    (mostly just mouse clicks, keyboard commands/movement, and most slash
    commands) with the password that you supply to the command. You must use
    this command a second time, supplying the same password, to unlock the
    interface. Passwords are NOT case-sensitive. So to lock your interface, you
    would type /safelock password. You would do the same to unlock it. REMEMBER:
    If you forget what password you typed, you will need to reboot your machine.
    <p><br>
    ** Item Changes **<br>
    - All the shields in the game that have the Ribcage graphic should now also
    have the ribcage icon when they are in your inventory.
    <p>- Tinkered Watchman helm should show up now.
    <p>- Ring of Pureblood is now equipable only on your fingers instead of your
    waist.
    <p>- Grand Master's Leg Wraps and Fists of the Grand Master are now No-Drop.
    They were intended to be No-Drop when they were created.
    <p>- Peacekeeper Staff and the Bug Collection box are no longer equipable.
    There are problems that can arise when containers can be equipped, so we had
    to disable that for these items.
    <p>- Sewing Kits: No existing sewing kits are being changed with this patch.
    But from now on, kits sold on vendors will be somewhat different. Large
    Sewing Kits will have 8 slots. Deluxe Sewing Kits will have 10 slots and
    weight slightly more than the Large Sewing Kit.
    <p>- Changed the color of the Kael SK quest armor from a very pretty
    blue-green to a more appropriate reddish-gray.
    <p><br>
    ** Other Stuff **<br>
    <b>- Changed the spelling of Troubador to Troubadour for the 55th level bard
    title. <img src="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif" width="15" height="15"></b>
    <p>- King Tormax's spawn rate has been adjusted to be more in line with that
    of his counterparts in Velious. This is not the sort of thing<br>
    that we will usually announce, as spawn times and things of that nature are
    part of the dynamic content of EverQuest. We're announcing this, however, to
    help avoid some confusion.
