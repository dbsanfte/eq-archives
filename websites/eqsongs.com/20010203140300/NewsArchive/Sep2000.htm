    ------------------------<br>
    September 19th, 7:00am<br>
    ------------------------<br>
    *Level 1 Character Purge*<br>
    The Level 1 character purge announced several weeks ago will take place on
    Wednesday, September 27, 2000, at 7:00am PST (GMT-7). Any level 1 characters
    that haven't been played within the previous 30 days will be deleted. If you
    wish to keep any level 1 characters that you may have, please log in and
    play them between now and 9/27.
    <p><br>
    ***Patch Day***<br>
    As a testament to our on-going goal to constantly provide more content for
    EverQuest players, today's patch primarily consists of *many*
    content-additions to the game.
    <p>*New Epic Quests*<br>
    We are pleased to announce that we have implemented new &quot;Fiery
    Avenger&quot; style quests for every class in the game (including paladins).
    The ultimate reward for each quest boasts a custom model with unique
    particle effects. We think that you will be pleased.
    <p>Good luck to everyone on your quest.
    <p>*Class Issues*
    <p>Rangers:<br>
    Last week we completed in-depth testing of melee and defensive skills for
    all melee-centric classes. In the course of these tests we determined that
    the ranger class was not performing to its intended level, and have made the
    following changes:
    <p>- The &quot;Jolt&quot; spell has had its casting time reduced.<br>
    - The Skillcap on Dodge and Parry has been increased.
    <p>Monks:<br>
    High-level monks can now carry increased weight without penalty. The
    additional allowance is granted at levels 55 and 60.
    <p>Cleric:<br>
    Celestial Elixir was failing due to multi-tick cure components that are
    incompatible with that configuration. We have therefore removed the cure
    components and increased the healing provided by this spell.
    <p>After a great deal of consideration, we have concluded that the Mark of
    Karn spell is imbalanced and requires correction. This spell's current
    function makes melee classes without dual-wield far less desirable members
    of the group. As such, the spell has had its duration decreased, its
    recast-time increased, and its &quot;heal per hit&quot; value decreased.
    <p><br>
    *Fungal Regrowth*<br>
    &quot;Fungal Regrowth&quot; is now a self-only spell. It was being used as
    an offensive spell by virtue of its &quot;snare&quot; effect upon the
    target. Furthermore, we ruled out making it &quot;group only&quot; as with
    other spells that have this issue, due to a class-balance concern. The spell
    was reducing the group's desire for classes capable of casting regenerative
    magic.
    <p><br>
    *Attack Speed Buffs*<br>
    In this patch we corrected a bug that would cause any &quot;Haste&quot; item
    combined with any &quot;Haste&quot; spell to automatically yield maximum
    haste, regardless of the level of &quot;Haste&quot; granted by each
    individual component. This fix increases the usefulness of better
    &quot;Haste&quot; equipment and spells. The downside to this is that those
    who usually have both items and spells active will see a reduced
    attack-speed unless outfitted with the best equipment and spells.
    <p><br>
    *High-Level Dungeon Balancing*<br>
    Veehshan's Peak and Sebilis have received loot adjustments in order to
    address disparities in risk and reward. For the most part, the quality of
    the &quot;common&quot; loot in Veeshan's Peak is at least as good as the
    &quot;rares&quot; from Sebilis.
    <p><br>
    *Low-Delay Weapons and Damage Bonus Changes*<br>
    In accordance with our announcement several weeks ago, two low-delay weapons
    can now only be equipped in the off-hand. Included in this change are the
    Mosscovered Twig and the Barbed Scale Whip. The delay on these weapons and
    the associated damage bonus to weapons in the primary hand made these
    weapons much too powerful for their availability and the risk associated
    with their acquisition.
    <p>In addition, two-handed weapons have had their damage-bonus modified. The
    damage-bonus for low-delay two-handed weapons (27 or below) created a
    problem similar to the weapons above and has been reduced. The damage-bonus
    has not changed for normal-delay (28-39) two-handed weapons. The damage
    bonus for high-delay two-handed weapons (40+) has been increased.
    <p><br>
    *Server Selection Screen*<br>
    It has come to our attention that new players often think that the
    high-population servers are better, based upon the logic that if everyone
    else is there, it must be a good server. However, in Massively-Multiplayer
    games, less populated servers are often considered superior for gameplay.
    Therefore we have marked servers that would benefit from new characters as
    preferred servers, listing them in &quot;green&quot; in the server selection
    window. The preferred servers have populations such that an influx of new
    people would benefit the server rather than cause overpopulation.
    <p><br>
    *Custom Emotes and AFK*<br>
    Animations with custom emotes have been implemented. Current canned emotes
    such as /point allow a target other than the current target to be specified.
    That will continue to work. So if you type &quot;/point Baobob&quot;, the
    usual text will come up. However, you can add custom text to the emote, but
    you must specify the target as &quot;say&quot; as the target. For instance:
    <p>/point say points at a gnoll, indicating that he is ready to kill it.
    <p>...your character will execute the /point animation, and the text output
    will be: &quot;CharacterName points at a gnoll, indicating that he is ready
    to kill it.&quot;
    <p>Finally, you can now set a custom message for when you are /AFK. Type
    &quot;/AFK &lt;message&gt;&quot; (without the brackets) to set your custom
    AFK message. For instance, if you type &quot;/afk Grabbing a snack&quot;,
    you will reply with &quot;Grabbing a snack&quot; when someone sends you a
    /tell.
    <p><br>
    *Skill Gain*<br>
    The skill-gain rate of many skills is now further modified by character
    stats. This will allow those with natural affinities towards certain skills
    to improve at a greater rate.
    <p><br>
    *Trade Skills Enhanced*<br>
    Many of the trade skills in game have received massive enhancements,
    including dozens of new craftable items, new fishing and foraging items, and
    other things to be discovered once in game.
    <p>In addition, trade-skill specialization has been implemented. Players
    will be able to exceed 200 points of skill in ONE of the generally available
    tradeskills. This includes:
    <p>- Baking<br>
    - Blacksmithing<br>
    - Brewing<br>
    - Jewelcraft<br>
    - Tailoring<br>
    - Fletching<br>
    - Pottery
    <p>Once above 200 points in one of these skills, no other skill will be able
    to exceed 200. Specialization restrictions do not include class or
    race-specific trade skills such as Alchemy, Make Poison, and Tinkering.
    Players with race or class-specific trade skills will be able to exceed 200
    points of skill in that skill, PLUS any generally available trade skill.
    <p>The enhancement of trade skills is an on-going project. Further
    enhancements will be made in the coming weeks.

          <p>They aren't completely useless, just reduced in usefulness once the

          One thing to please keep in mind with this 'revisitation' is that even
          if both the single target mez song were irresistible a bard with
          excellent timing, targeting, and low lag would only be able to keep 3
          mobs locked down at most. A like leveled enchanter can keep 4 mobs
          locked down indefinitely.</font>

          &gt;&gt;&gt;Do you even plan on reading any of these threads? Or do
          you just want fewer threads so they are easier to lock?
          <p>I plan to read this one for now.
          <p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Why can't you mez level 1 snakes in Freeport?
          <p>A player called me on the phone today shortly before I left work.
          We chatted for a while about various bard-related issues and this is
          one of them that came up. While he was on the phone I figured I'd
          check it out. I was unable to reproduce the claim that lullaby works
          better on level 1 npcs at level 15, than at level 60. In fact, I
          noticed a substantial decrease in primary resists, though secondaries
          remained constant, as they should.
          <p>In both cases I was able to mez the level one creatures a good
          percentage of the time.
          <p>&gt;&gt;&gt;I have a question Abashi. Do you or anyone else read
          and post to the class forums. Just a thought that maybe this board
          would not get so flooded if the other boards were given a little
          feedback.
          <p>Not in an official capacity. However, I imagine that some of the
          designers, programmers, and gms read them from time to time as they
          are also players of the game. The players will bring their issues to
          whereever they are most likely to be seen or receive a comment, so I
          think it's probably better to have it all in one place. I remember
          back in beta when Brad and team would visit the EQVault boards (all of
          them), and it usually led to the same posts being cross-posted to all
          of the boards.
          <p>&gt;&gt;&gt;If I think you are a company of liars and cheats is
          that a flame or an opinion?
          <p>That would be a flame, and you know it. Please don't make posts of
          that nature again. A lie requires intent to mislead or deceive as a
          statement of fact. For instance, &quot;Bards are balanced&quot; is not
          a lie no matter how much you disagree with it, or how much data you
          come up with to support your position. It is an opinion. &quot;Alchemy
          is working&quot; was a mistake. A mistake isn't a lie. &quot;We hope
          to have it fixed next week.&quot; is not a promise to absolutely get
          it fixed next week, and therefore not a lie if we don't make it.
          <p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Are you going to get GZ and Brad on here to explain why
          they went back on their word? Why they lied to use, then ignored our
          posts, only to have someone who isn't qualified to test our songs test
          them?
          <p>What word? And what lie? And as far as Ester's qualifications,
          she's very good at what she does. If you still don't accept that, then
          I'll also tell you that GZ was involved in the latest round of
          testing.
          <p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Make bard Mez as good as necro at least.<br>
          &gt;&gt;&gt;25-30 percent resist rates by design are not acceptable
          <p>There is no way that we can make a no-mana song as powerful as a
          mez as good as a spell that uses mana, which is the reason that it was
          changed to its current state last August or so.
          <p>&gt;&gt;&gt;There have been several instances where one of the
          developers states there is a problem, and then you come along and say
          it is working as intended. Now I'm not trying to flame, but, as I see
          it, you are over-riding the programmers and developers. Are you the
          main person who decides the all of the issues in EQ?
          <p>I think that there is little understanding on the level of
          communications that goes on behind the scenes. Depending on the issue,
          I may or may not bring other people into the decision process. I was
          hired due to my understanding of the big picture, being tuned in to
          what the design team was trying to accomplish. In many cases, I often
          have a better idea of this than anyone on a large scale, besides of
          course the producers and lead designers. That is why I make decisions
          in regard to what issues, for instance, that I'll bring to a tuning
          meeting for discussion.
          <p>Some other things do require a lot of communication between the
          various members of the team, and it is my responsibility to identify
          those issues and engage the appropriate people. I translate
          specific-issue &quot;design speak&quot; into english and see how it
          fits into the big picture.
          <p>&gt;&gt;&gt;It seems to me that, lately, you are TRYING to get
          people mad!!!!
          <p>Probably the biggest downside to what I do is that I get to take
          credit whenever a mistake is made by anyone. That's part of the job.
          It's not my job to point fingers at individual members, but to accept
          responsibility for the mistakes on behalf of Verant.
          <p>I of course take no joy in being the bearer of bad news. I'd much
          rather only have to announce the good stuff that pleases everyone, but
          both components are part of the job. So yes, that means that if a
          programmer says something that is in error, it may appear that I'm
          &quot;over-riding&quot; him even though that isn't really the case. I
          also get to take responsibility for my own mistakes (of which I've
          made many), and I think that most people here know that I own up to
          them.
          <p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Dis-satifaction is 100 times more infectious that
          satifaction is.
          <p>Don't I know it <img src="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif" width="15" height="15">
          <p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Could we see why the effectiveness of a song decreases
          on mobs as a Bard's level increases? Why do multiple mobs get two
          resists on a song that has an automatic resist check every 6 seconds
          anyway?
          <p>I think that I've effectively addressed these issues above, but
          I'll elaborate. The original implementation of the song made it much
          too powerful considering its lack of a mana control.
          <p>&gt;&gt;&gt;What is the Vision for Bards use?
          <p>That's for you to figure out and establish given the tools that
          we've provided. What is at your disposal? What can you do? Where can
          you excel? That is our vision for the bard class.
          <p>&gt;&gt;&gt;What are the parent classes for Bards?
          <p>Bards are not really hybrids despite having the same experience
          table. They are a class all to their own. If I had to name something,
          I'd call them part warrior, part rogue, part enchanter, part druid,
          and part shaman.
          <p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Why are bards one of the least played high level
          classes?
          <p>They are difficult to play well, and their name doesn't scream
          offensive power like some other classes.
          <p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Why are dozens of high level bards quitting over this
          issue?
          <p>Dozens of high-level players quit over every issue imaginable.
          Often I think that in cases like this, the player is burnt out and is
          looking for a reason to bail out or start a new class.
          <p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Why am I still holding a flute when playing a drum?
          <p>Evidently the drum animations aren't in, or perhaps we don't have
          anything that looks like a drum when held. I've not personally looked
          at the appearence in game to see.
          <p>&gt;&gt;&gt;How was chains imbalancing the game?
          <p>Chains had the power to reduce the effective movement of a fleeing
          NPC to zero, causing it to be an effective root. However, were an
          actual root spell used, the NPC would have fought having no other
          option available (fight or flight). It had fleeing mobs at a dead
          stop, yet not fighting back.
          <p>&gt;&gt;&gt;What he really wants is a single thread he can ignore
          instead of having to scroll through pages and pages of threads looking
          for the &quot;cool&quot; ones he can answer.
          <p>No, I just don't want to see one issue monopolizing the front page
          requiring me to pop around several different threads that say
          basically the same thing. Hopefully this way I'll be able to post one
          or two big responses in a place that everyone can find them.
          <p>&gt;&gt;&gt;You know the ones...&quot;Hey Abashi, what's your
          favorite color&quot; that seem to get a reply 2 minutes after being
          posted.
          <p>Deep metallic black.
          <p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Heh gotta love the 'working as intended' standard
          reply. I just wish VI would finally have GZ write down EXACTLY how
          each spell is INTENDED to work so that there wont be these ugly
          surprises months after you start playing a class... It's happened too
          many times with my enchanter, necro, druid, and ranger...
          <p>Most spells work as intended until someone finds a way to make it
          work in a way that wasn't intended. People think that new way they've
          discovered is the way it is supposed to work, so when we make changes
          so that it only works as intended, it's perceived as a nerf.
          <p>&gt;&gt;&gt;No, they don't plan on reading it. A while ago Abashi
          posted something saying that 'Class issue were going to still be read,
          but not replys to anymore.' Raise your hands if you believe that
          anyone is going to bother reading them.
          <p>*raises his hand*
          <p>I'll make an exception in this case for a few days since it's on a
          new and hot issue.
          <p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Hows this Abashi, the day you start really, really
          listening to us, and making real changes will be the same day we start
          listening to you and changing how much negative stuff is on the board.
          <p>Please don't confuse &quot;no&quot; with not listening. We always
          listen, just sometimes the answer isn't the one people want.
          <p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Why do y'all seem to feel that your inability to
          mesmerize negates your class?<br>
          &gt;&gt;&gt;Bards are all-around nifty
          <p>I agree completely.
          <p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Because we're slowly being nerfed into a manna battery,
          regen source for other classes.
          <p>I wouldn't reduce it to that, but bards are indeed supposed to be a
          support class.
          <p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Wouldn't it be easier to just fix the song than to
          avoid the issue for 10 months, then piss off 80% of your bard
          community defending yet another unintentional nerf?
          <p>There's nothing unintentional about the way that lullaby is
          currently working. That said, I do indeed wish that we'd done all of
          the work and announced our findings sooner rather than later. For
          that, I sincerely apologize.
          <p>&gt;&gt;&gt;People CAN'T IMAGINE that you want these songs to be
          this completely useless. Even if it IS as designed, a concept which I
          myself have a great deal of trouble adjusting to, then your design is
          broken and needs fixing.
          <p><b>They aren't completely useless, just reduced in usefulness once
          the targets go over level 30. That said, we're not opposed to
          revisiting pixie strike and twilight to see if they need to be changed
          positively now that we know that lullaby is working correctly.</b>

          Hello all,<br>
          <br>
          Abashi already preped you for this, but here is the 'official'
          results.<br>
          Please know that not only have we done our own testing, but we have
          talked to GZ and the programmer in charge of such things.<br>
          <br>
          Lullabye is working as we intended. The song was not meant to work
          well on mobs over level 30. The upgrade is the Pixie strike, and then
          again<br>
          Twilight. However, even the upgrages were never meant to be as
          effective as the Enchanter's spells.<br>
          <br>
          I am sorry this was not found out earlier. I will continue to look
          into any other songs that may be bugged.
          <p>If you have comments on the design of these or other songs please
          feel free to take them to General Discussion.<br>
          <br>
