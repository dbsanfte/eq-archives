    lack of updates.&nbsp; Between&nbsp; work and some recent personal life upheavals
    I have not had the time or inclination to update the site much.&nbsp; Things
    are settling down a bit now and updates should start appearing on a more
    regular basis.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    Anyway on to the news!&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
    As many of you now Absor posted on the WhinePlay forum that the single
    target mez songs are being fixed (<a href="../Songs/Song28.htm">Crission's Pixie Strike</a>
    and <a href="../Songs/song53b.htm">Song of Twilight</a>).&nbsp; Specifically
    Pixie Strike is supposed to have the secondary resist lowered and Twilight
    will have it removed entirely with an extend duration.&nbsp; I have read
    some posts and emails stating that none of the mez songs are giving any
    secondary resist messages, I have not had a chance to check this
    myself.&nbsp; Not sure if this is a bug or they stealth patched it as the changes
    are not supposed to go in till the next patch (the DX 7 patch).<br>
    <br>
    The other big change announced in Absor's post was the changes for the 2
    upper level Jonthan's songs (<a href="../Songs/Song45.htm">Jonthan's Provocation</a>
    and <a href="../Songs/song58a.htm">Jonthan's Inspiration</a>).&nbsp; I had
    grave misgivings about these changes personally as I have found them useful
    in certain cases.&nbsp; But at the Las Vegas Event I was able to chat with a
    couple of the Live Team members about it.&nbsp; The changes to these songs
    are going to be a nice power up to the songs, the goal they told me was that
    they would allow a bard using them to effectively tank while doing so.&nbsp;
    It will be interesting to see how they are going to work.<br>
    <br>
    At the Houston EQFest 2000 GZ had the following to say:<br>
    GZ: &quot;<b>Look for some VERY interesting things to be happening to
    Lullaby soon</b>&quot;<br>
    GZ: &quot;<b>We have been thinking about bard mez, we didn't want them to
    infringe on the Enchanter role, as that is what Enchanters do best, BUT we
    don't think that giving bards some mez abilities will hurt</b>&quot;<br>
    If anyone has more details on this please let me know.<br>
    <br>
    Lastly Singing Short Sword is going to get a nice upgrade it seems.&nbsp;
    Currently on the Test Server I am told the proc now has a much larger range
    and when the SSS is in the primary hand it will boost songs like it was a
    store bought instrument of the appropriate type.&nbsp; This certainly makes
    the Sword worth getting.<br>
    <br>
    All in all, I am very happy with the upcoming changes to the Bard
    class.&nbsp; These are the best things to happen since they fixed the Chant
    series to work correctly with drums.<br>
    <br>
    Great work Verant!<!--mstheme--></font><!--msthemelist--></td></tr>
