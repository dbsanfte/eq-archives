				Apologies for my tardy updates to the site, y'all.  A lot has gone
				down in the past week -- I'll do my best to get it all in here.

				Brother Gridgebringer has left the Reach to rejoin his former guild.
				The reasons for his departure are well documented in the

					HREF="http://oboo.cybrick.com/ubbcgi/Ultimate.cgi"

				just like to add that some of the behavior surrounding this situation
				by unnamed members was innappropriate.  Let it be said that never should
				a guildmember insult ( other than, perhaps, in jest ) a fellow Oboo
				on a public channel.  We are a family, and any disputes we might have
				are much better handled internally.
				<BR><BR>
				We have been at mock war with our <A

					HREF="http://oboo.cybrick.com/ubbcgi/Ultimate.cgi"
					TITLE="Forum"
					OnMouseOver="self.status='Forum';return true"
					OnMouseOut="self.status='';return true">forum</A> ), but I think
				many valuable lessons were learned on both sides.  We will be having
				such mock wars again in the future, although they will be more focused
				and better organized than this one.  This war officially expires today.

				The largest news item is a slight change
				in our admission policies.  After much deliberation and discussion
				among the ministers, it has been decided that The Reach will now also
				allow the admission of <I>Necromancer</I> Gnomes.  Fear not, as this extension
				of our membership policy does not, nor will it ever, extend to the
				shorties as a whole.  It was our feeling that Gnome Necros are
				just as oppressed as the rest of us due to their chosen profession
				and all around ugliness.  Due to their geographical birthplace,
				we felt it made more sense geographically for them to belong in The
				Reach than in the Bears.  For this same reason we thought it best to
				leave Erudite Shadow Knights and Necromancers to the Bears.  In the spirit
				of empowering <B>all</B> of our members, if a strong feeling of disdain over
				this decision is felt by the majority of our ranks, it will be
				repealed.
