				The Reach of Oboo is dedicated to the organization and
				mobilization of the great dark aligned masses of Norrath. We believe that
				Humans and pale Elves take far too central and oppressive a role in the
				world of Everquest.
				<BR><BR>
				We, the minority, need to take a stance of solidarity against the Humans and
				surface Elves, and let our oppressors know that they can no longer keep
				us down. Stand up for your rights and let your voice be heard!
				<OL>
					<LI>That while our capital is wherever our people are, through
					a long history of oppression, the Humans and surface Elves have
					required us to centralize our government. We hereby declare
					Neriak is our piece of the rock, a place where brothers and sisters can
					come together as one without fear of the oppressive filthmongers meddling.</LI>
					<LI>Freeport is more of a Neriak suburb, and a vanilla one at that.</LI>
					<LI>We want freedom. We want power to determine the destiny of our oppressed
					communities.</LI>
					<LI>We are truly gainin' on the Humans.</LI>
					<LI>The Reach of Oboo supports all Everquest rules of conduct.</LI>
					<LI>Any who choose to share their guild tags with Humans and
					Elves are traitors to our cause. The Reach of Oboo believe, however, that these
					misguided souls should be treated with pity, not with the hatred that we
					reserve for Humans and pale Elves.</LI>
					<LI>James Brown is the Godfather of Funk.</LI>

				<B>The Reach of Oboo Rules of Conduct</B>
			</FONT>
			<FONT FACE="verdana,geneva,arial,helvetica" SIZE="1">
				<OL>
					<LI>The Reach of Oboo demand that all guild members abide by 
					Verant's Rules of Conduct.</LI>
					<LI>Members of the Reach of Oboo must, at all times, have as
					a primary goal the advancement of the Teir'Dal, Troll, Ogre and
					other aligned races in their never-ending contention with human and
					elvenkind.</LI>
					<LI>Guild members should attempt to recruit new members for the Reach
					of Oboo by presenting prospects with Oboo literature, available on
					this Web page.</LI>
					<LI>Guild members should avoid grouping with Humans, Wood Elves,
					Half Elves, and High Elves whenever possible, and should not
					befriend them.</LI>
					<LI>The Reach of Oboo does not accept the invasion of our native lands,
					Nektulos Forest, Innothule Swamp and the Feerrott by Humans and Elves.</LI>
					<LI>Guild members shall not eat one another or rely on alcohol for
					spiritual fulfillment, though the occasional drink is acceptable.
					hot n' spicy toelings and charred Wood Elf are the recommended diet
					of an Oboo.</LI>
					<LI>The Guild shall consist of Teir'Dal, Ogres, Trolls and friends
					of our cause. It will never contain any Human, Wood Elf, Half Elf,
					or High Elf.</LI>
					<LI>Guild members are not allowed to keep their "anon" flags on, as
					it does not allow people to query for guild members. You should be
					proud of your guild, and want to have it appear in all queries.</LI>
					<LI>The Oboo do not use threats, bad language, or insults
					with any other players in game, regardless of circumstances.
					Though it is understood that problems will arise within the game,
					we ask that our Bears show restraint and maturity in the face of
					immaturity and disrespectfulness. You catch more flies with
					honey than with vinegar.</LI>
					<LI>When posting on public forums, the Oboo should not
					engage in mudslinging, name-calling fights. Message Boards are
					one way in which our guild name gets out there, and The Bears
					of Oboo want to present a united face to the world, and civility will
					win us more respect than anything else we do. Though Bears are
					certainly encouraged to be vocal in public forums, we assume
					that they have been trained, through the discipline of the group,
					to exercize restraint and demonstrate maturity.</LI>
					<LI>We ask that internal disagreements are kept in-house until their
					resolution. If you have a problem with a guild member or part of
					the guild structure, we ask that you use our message board to
					resolve them, or that you speak to an officer or to the offending
					party in-game before taking it to a public forum. We must present
					a uniform face to the world if we hope to attain our own freedom,
					and we operate under the firm belief that almost all
					disagreements within the guild can be resolved with open
					communication.</LI>
					<LI>Failure to comply with any guild rule may result in punishment
					up to and including standing in the corner for fifteen minutes.</LI>
