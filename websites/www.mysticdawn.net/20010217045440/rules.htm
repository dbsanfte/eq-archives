<p align="center"><font face="Harrington" color="#814500"><big><big><big><big><big><b><i>Basic
Rules</i></b></big></big></big></big></big></font></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><font face="Harrington" color="#814500">It is most important,
and above all REQUIRED, that all members keep in mind that everything you say
and do, is now associated with the Brethren of the Mystic Dawn. Also, this is a
Role-Playing guild. When faced with a decision, do what Role-Plays best. Even if
that means dying to aid one of the house.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Harrington" color="#814500" size="5"><b><i><u>Common
Courtesy Rules</u></i></b></font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Harrington" color="#814500">1) Profanity is
unacceptable.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Harrington" color="#814500">2) Killstealing is not
tolerated, and will be grounds for dismissal from the guild.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Harrington" color="#814500">3) The training of
guards and other creatures for the intent to harm another player is also intolerable,
and will be grounds for dismissal from the guild.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Harrington" color="#814500">4) This is a
role-playing guild. Therefore, you will show the respect due to your guild
leaders at all times. If in group, or they say otherwise, first name basis is
acceptable. However during official business, or in the public's view, the
leader's title shall be used.&nbsp; If a member constantly refuses to show
respect to other members of the guild they will be issued a warning.&nbsp; If it
continues, they will be asked to leave the guild.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Harrington" color="#814500" size="5"><b><i><u>Guild
members Encouraged to Follow</u></i></b></font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Harrington" color="#814500">1) Since we are a
Role-Playing guild members should stay in character as much as possible.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Harrington" color="#814500">2) Show respect to
other game players.&nbsp; There may be a situation when faced with aiding a
person Out of Character, when In Character you would not.&nbsp; Remember you
might need their aide at some point in time.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Harrington" color="#814500">3) Try to travel with
other members of the guild as much as possible. It is known that this is not
possible to do at all times, but try to remember that we are a guild battling
for the forces of good and need to set a good example.&nbsp; If at anytime
you feel it necessary to not role-play and just kill a few monsters, please turn
off your role-play tag and go anonymous.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Harrington" color="#814500">4) By being accepted
as a member of the Brethren of the Mystic Dawn, you&nbsp; swore an oath to stand
by your new family above all others.&nbsp; Travel with your fellow guild mates,
for there is strength in numbers and together we are strong.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Harrington" color="#814500">5)While adventuring, if any equipment such as weapons, armor, runes, etc., are
obtained, and not useful by your current party, please offer them to the members of the guild before selling it to a merchant or
auctioning it off.&nbsp; As you may be searching for a specific item, others may
be doing the same.&nbsp; This does not mean that we condone twinking.&nbsp; As a
matter of fact you should not give an item to another member that would not be
in his abilities at that point in time.&nbsp; In addition to this, any equipment
obtained by another member of the guild is theirs to do with what they
desire.&nbsp; At no point in time is any member of the guild required to give
the item they have earned to another in the guild.&nbsp; If they wish to make a
gift that is their choice.&nbsp; <b>ALSO, asking that higher seasoned members
obtain items for you that you could not possibly get yourself is unacceptable
and could be grounds for dismissal from the guild.</b>&nbsp; We are not a guild
that is here to powerlevel or twink other people.&nbsp; If that is what you are
seeking, seek elsewhere, you will not find it here</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Harrington" color="#814500">6) Please stop and
role-play with any that wish to role-play with you.&nbsp; This speaks highly of
both you and the guild.&nbsp; We want to promote a good role-playing impression at all
times.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Harrington" color="#814500">7)Help out those that
are less knowledgeable than you.&nbsp; That includes stepping into a battle if
they are about to perish and request help or showing them the way to a bank or
guild hall.&nbsp; Again this can only reflect good upon us and shows that we are
here to bring good across the lands of Norrath.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Harrington" color="#814500">8) If you get into a
situation where another player is downright rude and disrespectful, do not lower
yourself to their level.&nbsp; Do not resort to using the /shout or /ooc&nbsp;
to resolve the issue, this will only reflect badly upon us.&nbsp; Please advise
the guild of the situation and allow us to assist you to resolve the situation..</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Harrington" color="#814500">9) Have fun!&nbsp; We
are here to enjoy adventures and have fun.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Harrington" color="#814500" size="5"><b><i><u>Dueling
Rules</u></i></b></font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Harrington" color="#814500">1) No looting from
your defeated opponent. The only exception to the rule is if it is a
predetermined guild quest, and it is intentionally put there for the purpose of
the quest.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Harrington" color="#814500">2) Absolutely no
outside interference during a duel.&nbsp; Any spells or buffs must be in place
prior to the start of the duel, unless they can be casted by the individual that
is dueling. If these rules are broken it may be grounds for dismissal from the
guild.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Harrington" color="#814500">It should be noted,
that these rules apply to all duels. However, as the forces of evil are bound by
no such rules, it does not mean that you should break any of the other rules in
dealing with the situation. If the situation gets out of hand, please get one
of the council involved immediately.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Harrington" color="#814500" size="5"><b><i><u>Guild
war Rules</u></i></b></font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Harrington" color="#814500">1) No training at any
point in time.&nbsp; If it is done report it immediately.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Harrington" color="#814500">2) Looting is limited
to coin only.&nbsp; NO items may be taken.&nbsp; Violation of this rule may be
grounds for dismissal.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Harrington" color="#814500">3) After you are
killed, there is a one hour &quot;no play&quot;&nbsp; rule.&nbsp; You are
required to turn off your Role-Play and go anonymous.&nbsp; At this point you
may not do anything that can affect the outcome of the war.&nbsp; This also
means that additionally&nbsp; nobody else can do anything directed towards you.
Only turn off your role-play tag and go anonymous if you have been killed.&nbsp;
The one hour time limit&nbsp; is in place to prevent the abuse of Lay Hands or
Harm Touch to the perspective&nbsp; classes.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Harrington" color="#814500">4) During a guild war
at no time except due to death, are you allowed to turn off your Role-play tag
and go anonymous.&nbsp; If during the duration of the war you do not wish to participate
then you should advise your Superior and log off.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Harrington" color="#814500">5) During&nbsp; a
Guild War you are required to Check in and out with your Superior.</font></p>
