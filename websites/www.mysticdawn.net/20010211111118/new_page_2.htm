<p align="center"><font color="#814500" face="Harrington" size="3">Howdy,
folks!&nbsp; It has come time for yours truly (Jeppo) to begin his
semi-regularly scheduled updates to the news involving the Brethren of the
Mystic Dawn.&nbsp; I am hoping to update two or three times a week and I would
like to include such nifty things like hunts, quests completed, seasons gained,
etc.&nbsp; I will include screen shots of grandiose things, funny quotes, and
other swell things that make our time in Norrath so special.&nbsp; So please,
when ya run across me in Norrath, send me a tell informing me of stuff in your
life that you would like to see reported.&nbsp; DON'T MAKE ME HUNT YA DOWN FOR A
GOOD BONKING for lack of information.&nbsp; You can also e-mail me at <a href="mailto:jeppo@mysticdawn.net">jeppo@mysticdawn.net</a>.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#814500" face="Harrington" size="3">So, without
further ado, here is a brief update of what has been going on from the
Jeppster's perspective!&nbsp; Well, we tackled the Plane of Fear recently and I
am fairly certain many of our members got some planar armor.&nbsp; I couldn't
stay for the entire raid as I began to notice QWERTY on m'face.&nbsp; The lovely
Avatar presented me with a Girdle of the Diligent the next day (Thanks
Chrysania!).&nbsp; With the aid of the Alliance, Cazic-Thule and the undead
Draco dragon thingy did fall!</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#814500" face="Harrington" size="3">With the
assistance of many Brethren members and some of the Nameless Templars, we
journeyed into the depths of Nagafen's Lair to take on the Efreeti Lord
Djorn!&nbsp; After a brief setback, we regrouped and made it past all the imps
and lava guardians and faced off with the Efreeti himself.&nbsp; Shoryuuken
turned everyone into skeletons, except me (&gt;boggle&lt;) and we took him down
rather quickly.&nbsp; Come see me if ye ever want to check out what treasure the
Lord Djorn had on him (lets just say m'feets are yellowier and wiser).</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#814500" face="Harrington" size="3">Some of us
spent some time in the Plane of Hate this past week as well!&nbsp; With the
leadership of Illucia, from the Decadent Few, we were able to fight off the
minions of Innorruk for a couple of evenings!&nbsp; Also, a big, fat salute to
Ryszard for his learning of how to pull that filthy place!&nbsp; If ye never
attended a hunt with Illucia as the leader, I highly recommend it.&nbsp; It is
very memorable, so I suggest to try it at least once!</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#814500" face="Harrington" size="3">Hmmm, what
else...&nbsp; Oh, yeah, many of our Brethren achieved the necessary seasons to
go on planar raids recently by hunting in the City of Mist!&nbsp; I'm looking
forward to going on more journeys with you all!&nbsp; Congrats City of Misters!</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#814500" face="Harrington" size="3">Oh, I spoke
with Squire Wingulf recently and asked him about his Knighthood quest that I
gave to him.&nbsp; He is doing well in the Lost Temple of Cazic-Thule and is achieving
many seasons in his quest for the lost Ravenscale armors from the Tae Ew Templar
and Tae Ew Diviner.&nbsp; If ya get a chance to see Wingulf, give him a good
luck hug, or hi-five.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#814500" face="Harrington" size="3">Once I figure
out how to do these updates better, I intend to organize it a little more.&nbsp;
Please be patient!&nbsp; I would like to add screenshots, good quotes, and some
kind of daily Jeppo-ism so that all of you people get some good reading while
taking a break from work, hehe.&nbsp; Until I write again... be well!</font></p>
