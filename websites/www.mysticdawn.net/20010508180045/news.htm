the monks was see running from zone to zone, with a strange aura surrounding his

amazing other photos that were submitted, and added to the archives here.</font>

<p align="center"><font color="#814500" face="Arial" size="3">Hail
Brethren!&nbsp; Sorry for my lack of updating as of late.&nbsp; Well, let me get
started with a little about retirement.&nbsp; In a nutshell, I didn't
retire!&nbsp; I would like to thank all of you fine people for helping me see
how great this game is and how it isn't about &quot;the game&quot; all of the
time, it is about friends and hanging out with good people.&nbsp; Experience
will come, adventures will come, but the friends part of the game is what keeps
me coming back.&nbsp; As far as news updates are concerned, lemme save that for
another paragraph...</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#814500" face="Arial" size="3">OK, this seems to
be a new paragraph, so lets update some news!&nbsp; First of all,
congratulations to Deral and his Call of Earth (Flame) spell, sorry I can't
remember which one, I sort of missed that quest.&nbsp; But a big
congratulations, anyway!&nbsp; Also, I salute Falkieri for gaining his Divine
Might spell.&nbsp; Pally nuke owns you!!!&nbsp; Not sure what that means, but I
see our paladins have been saying that a lot lately, so it must mean
something.&nbsp; I have noticed that many in our ranks have attained their 50th
season, this includes me, so it is important (*a big, mischievous grin*).</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#814500" face="Arial" size="3">Chazzmirh recently
had many of us along on a Plane of Hate raid.&nbsp; I feel that we did an
excellent job and fun was had by all that attended.&nbsp; I know I enjoyed it a
lot.&nbsp; I look like a grape now, but please do not rub it in, I'm a tad
self-conscious about it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#814500" face="Arial" size="3">I would like for
us to take a moment to welcome our newest members of the Brethren.&nbsp; A hardy
hello to Dirklungaft, warrior of Kaladim.&nbsp; Well met, good warrior.&nbsp;
Let us help you in your quests!&nbsp; Also a big hello to Nizzara, fair
enchanter of Norrath.&nbsp; Well met, noble enchanter.&nbsp; I look forward to
spending many a hunt with you fine people.&nbsp; Let us continue to fight the
good fight and always look out for new comrades to share in this experience.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#814500" face="Arial" size="3">Hmmmm, not much
else going on.&nbsp; I know that we are heading to the Plane of Fear on
Friday.&nbsp; Rumor has it that Cazic-Thule has grown stronger.&nbsp; Perhaps
his evil ways are feeding him someway.&nbsp; Also, on Saturday, Chardok look
out, we are coming in!&nbsp; Seems there has been some strange occurrences in
Qeynos lately.&nbsp; A mysterious fog has been doing all kinds of odd
things.&nbsp; Perhaps on Monday or sometime, we can explore this for ourselves.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#814500" face="Arial" size="3">Sorry for the lack
of pictures, but they take quite a while on my uber 28.8 connection.&nbsp; I
wanted to get an update done sometime this week =)</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#814500" face="Arial" size="3">Ahhhh, hello
Brethren!&nbsp; Once again it is time for my semi-regularly scheduled update of
the happenings of the Brethren of the Mystic Dawn from a short, balding halfling
cleric's perspective.&nbsp; Well, the first thing you may notice is that I
decided to use a different pen for the scrolls.&nbsp; People been saying that
writing in that scripture style and all that jazz is hard on the eyes for long
reads, so I decided to use my #12 Arial pen!&nbsp; Whaddya think?&nbsp; I have
decided to post some pictures that were taken in this edition, here is my
favorite:</font></p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="Jeppo/Typical%20Falkieri.jpg" width="600" height="450"></p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#814500">Typical Falkieri,
eh?&nbsp; Bah!&nbsp; Get back and fight, ya pansy!&nbsp; I'm just kidding,
Falkieri.&nbsp; I know that deep down in your heart, you could have taken them!</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#814500">Anyway, a lot has
been going on in Norrath as of late.&nbsp; I know that the Justicar, Alysandir
completed another part of his epic quest!&nbsp; The troops marched into Castle
Mistmoore and slayed the Black Dire Wolf with ease. Congratulations,
Justicar!&nbsp; I hope to aid you in the end!</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#814500">On the seasonal
side of things, Alysandir, Deral, and Falkieri all have achieved their 50th
seasons!&nbsp; Thats a lot of seasons, in my opinion.&nbsp; Personally, I just
gathered my 49th season and boy oh boy am I loving clericdom!</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#814500">As far as other
quests are concerned, I have been briefly updated on a few involving our dearest
members!&nbsp; Iianae has completed her master's quest.&nbsp; She is now a Grand
Master Fletcher!&nbsp; If ya be needing some arrows or a nice bow, mayhap the
fine, wood-elven lass can make ye some or one or both or whatever.&nbsp; Our
monks, Ryszard and Aedwy have completed their Lost Circle quest!&nbsp; They now
don nifty looking robes that make them look like finger wigglers.&nbsp; Just
don't tell them that or ye might take a kick in the tooth.&nbsp; I know Greyna
has completed her quest for the tiny coffin from Neriak for Bucco's
studies.&nbsp; That filthy city stinks of inkie, I am impressed by the savviness
and cunning of Greyna in her attaining of this item!&nbsp; Squire Wingulf has
succeeded in attaining his Ravenscale armor off the evil lispards in the Lost
Temple of Cazic-Thule.&nbsp; He also achieved many seasons there!&nbsp; Way to
go all!&nbsp; I salute thee many times over!&nbsp; If I forgot a quest, send me
a mystical message and I will update it next time!</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#814500">Now for the
hunting!&nbsp; I noticed many of us spending time slaughtering the foul giants
near Kael Drakkel.&nbsp; These giants have been at war with the noble Coldain
dwarves for years and it has come the time to help put an end to their
actions!&nbsp; The dragons of Velious also have a bone to pick with the
giants.&nbsp; I suggest we learn a bit more of this war between the three races
before we get ourselves in too deep.&nbsp; Never know if we are being conned
into helping the wrong race.&nbsp; I shall research the histories a little more
and give an update later.&nbsp; We assisted Chazzmirh, from the Harbingers of
Death in his quest for the Coldain Ring.&nbsp; I took pictures, but for the love
of Bristlebane, man!&nbsp; I lost them somehow.&nbsp; Me thinks I pressed the *
key instead of the - one.&nbsp; Oh well, I will just post these pictures in
honor of the epic battles we had with the orcs and dwarves.&nbsp; There was
blood all around (mostly orcen blood) and no casualties during the dwarf - orc
battle and it was truly epic indeed.&nbsp; We continued in finding Icefang, a
big-arse wolf.&nbsp; He had teeth as long as m'arms and his breath smelt of
Santhar's!&nbsp; But he was a nice puppy, until we tracked him to an orc outpost
and he turned on us!&nbsp; We lost one comrade in this battle, yet we won the
skirmish rather quickly.&nbsp; Chazzmirh had almost finished this quest at the
time of my departure.&nbsp; I wish him well, and great job to the Brethren for
supporting him and his noble cause.&nbsp; Oh, yeah, the screenshots:</font></p>

night, Deral will need our aid in fighting the evil ranger poacher in the
Karanas.&nbsp; I will try my hardest to be there.&nbsp; After that goes down,

<p align="center"><font color="#814500" face="Harrington" size="3">Howdy,
folks!&nbsp; It has come time for yours truly (Jeppo) to begin his
semi-regularly scheduled updates to the news involving the Brethren of the
Mystic Dawn.&nbsp; I am hoping to update two or three times a week and I would
like to include such nifty things like hunts, quests completed, seasons gained,
etc.&nbsp; I will include screen shots of grandiose things, funny quotes, and
other swell things that make our time in Norrath so special.&nbsp; So please,
when ya run across me in Norrath, send me a tell informing me of stuff in your
life that you would like to see reported.&nbsp; DON'T MAKE ME HUNT YA DOWN FOR A
GOOD BONKING for lack of information.&nbsp; You can also e-mail me at <a href="mailto:jeppo@mysticdawn.net">jeppo@mysticdawn.net</a>.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#814500" face="Harrington" size="3">So, without
further ado, here is a brief update of what has been going on from the
Jeppster's perspective!&nbsp; Well, we tackled the Plane of Fear recently and I
am fairly certain many of our members got some planar armor.&nbsp; I couldn't
stay for the entire raid as I began to notice QWERTY on m'face.&nbsp; The lovely
Avatar presented me with a Girdle of the Diligent the next day (Thanks
Chrysania!).&nbsp; With the aid of the Alliance, Cazic-Thule and the undead
Draco dragon thingy did fall!</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#814500" face="Harrington" size="3">With the
assistance of many Brethren members and some of the Nameless Templars, we
journeyed into the depths of Nagafen's Lair to take on the Efreeti Lord
Djorn!&nbsp; After a brief setback, we regrouped and made it past all the imps
and lava guardians and faced off with the Efreeti himself.&nbsp; Shoryuuken
turned everyone into skeletons, except me (&gt;boggle&lt;) and we took him down
rather quickly.&nbsp; Come see me if ye ever want to check out what treasure the
Lord Djorn had on him (lets just say m'feets are yellowier and wiser).</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#814500" face="Harrington" size="3">Some of us
spent some time in the Plane of Hate this past week as well!&nbsp; With the
leadership of Illucia, from the Decadent Few, we were able to fight off the
minions of Innorruk for a couple of evenings!&nbsp; Also, a big, fat salute to
Ryszard for his learning of how to pull that filthy place!&nbsp; If ye never
attended a hunt with Illucia as the leader, I highly recommend it.&nbsp; It is
very memorable, so I suggest to try it at least once!</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#814500" face="Harrington" size="3">Hmmm, what
else...&nbsp; Oh, yeah, many of our Brethren achieved the necessary seasons to
go on planar raids recently by hunting in the City of Mist!&nbsp; I'm looking
forward to going on more journeys with you all!&nbsp; Congrats City of Misters!</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#814500" face="Harrington" size="3">Oh, I spoke
with Squire Wingulf recently and asked him about his Knighthood quest that I
gave to him.&nbsp; He is doing well in the Lost Temple of Cazic-Thule and is achieving
many seasons in his quest for the lost Ravenscale armors from the Tae Ew Templar
and Tae Ew Diviner.&nbsp; If ya get a chance to see Wingulf, give him a good
luck hug, or hi-five.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#814500" face="Harrington" size="3">Once I figure
out how to do these updates better, I intend to organize it a little more.&nbsp;
Please be patient!&nbsp; I would like to add screenshots, good quotes, and some
kind of daily Jeppo-ism so that all of you people get some good reading while
taking a break from work, hehe.&nbsp; Until I write again... be well!</font></p>
