<p align="left"><font face="Harrington" color="#814500"><b>As you enter the room of a
nearby inn you see four figures sitting around a table studying a parchment.&nbsp; A Half
Elf female looks up at you, letting a single white lock of hair fall in front of her face
as she takes a swig from a glass of ale.&nbsp; Another Half Elf stares at the parchment in
silence and you can see on his face his desire to be in the wilds.&nbsp;&nbsp; A
Gnome and Barbarian seem to be in great debate over the single meaning of a translation on the parchment
and the entire room seems to be in a slight discomfort.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Harrington" color="#814500"><b>With a nervous clearing of the
throat, you try to speak up over the noise of the room.&nbsp; &quot;Excuse me, I am
looking for the Brethren of the Mystic Dawn.&nbsp; I am here to join the
cause.&quot;&nbsp; </b></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Harrington" color="#814500"><b>Every person in the room goes
silent except a female Feir'dal in the corner sharpening a great axe, who turns to look you in
the eyes.&nbsp; Your face flushes with excitement and embarrassment, but your resolve, and
the fact that your legs don't seem to be working anymore, hold you in place.&nbsp; What
were you thinking&nbsp; when you decided to take this course, this chance at fate to be
one of the elite members of Norrath?&nbsp; </b></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Harrington" color="#814500"><b>Then suddenly, a sense of
tranquility comes over you as you see a male Feir'dal approach you.&nbsp; He places his
hand on your shoulder and you relax a bit.&nbsp; You feel a family here and you now desire
not only to be here as a part of its cause, but as a member of this unity.&nbsp; And as
the door closes behind you, you can see the smile of a blonde haired Feir'dal with a staff
in his hand mystically fade from view.</b></font></p>
