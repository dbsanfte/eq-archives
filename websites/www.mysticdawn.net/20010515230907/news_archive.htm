Well I have to admit, we have been sparse in this area.&nbsp; Belrich the Druid

Benedicto of Seraph were wed at&nbsp; beautiful ceremony in the Fairy City in
Lesser Faydwer.&nbsp; We have three wonderful additions to the family, so give a
hug or a handshake to Lady Rinala, Apprentice Kyruss, and Apprentice Ozzandar.&nbsp;

      Talastarr:</b></font><br>
</p>

<blockquote>
  <div>
    <font face="Harrington" size="3">Recently it had come to my attention that
    two of my Brother monks from the Silent Fist Order in Qeynos, Dareb and Shen,
    had come up missing. It was known that they had traveled to South Karana and
    the Brotherhood feared that they had run afoul of the evil gnoll Gahnex Drah.
    Indeed, as it turns out, their suspicions were correct. Last week, I
    journeyed in the hole of the gnolls known as Paw and after giving a number
    of lesser gnolls a sound thrashing, they revealed to me that Gahnex Drah had
    indeed slain both monks and had given Shen's head to High Shaman Grisok as a
    trophy and Dareb's head to High Shaman Phido.</font>
    <p><font face="Harrington" size="3">Filled with a sense of urgency and the
    rage of revenge, I found the evil Gahnex and slew him, avenging my fellow
    monks' deaths. I then proceeded to find and slay the High Shaman Grisok,
    thus allowing me to collect Brother Shen's remains for a fitting burial back
    in Qeynos. I also desired to slay High Shaman Phido, but learned that he was
    indeed quite a&nbsp;powerful caster and a bit too much for me to challenge
    alone.</font>
  </div>
  <div>
    <font face="Harrington" size="3"><br>
    Therefore, I enlisted the aid of our sister Suzy, who joined me last night
    in a return visit to Paw. After much searching, we found his quarters but he
    was not present. Not to be denied, we set up our ambush for his return.
    (Interestingly, other gnolls clearly saw us there waiting for the High
    Shaman, but did nothing to stop us, treacherous beasts that they are.) After
    a short while, the High Shaman appeared and fell right into our trap. A
    battle ensued, a toe-to-toe slugfest between myself and the shaman. The
    battle was very close the entire way, but Suzy was able tip the scales in
    favor of good with some well timed heal spells upon me and a few well placed
    hammer blows of her own. After we defeated the Shaman, I retrieved poor
    Dareb's remains. Suzy and I remained in Paw a short time further, then
    parted ways for the evening. Alone now, I journeyed to Qeynos and delivered
    the remains of my brother
    monks and the head of their murderer to the Silent Fist Guild. In
    appreciation of my deeds, they presented me with the coveted Red Headband of
    their order.</font>
