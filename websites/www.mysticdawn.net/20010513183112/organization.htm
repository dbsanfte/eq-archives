<p align="center"><font face="Harrington" size="5" color="#814500"><b><a name="Rose of Odus"><i><u>Rose
of Odus</u></i></a></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Harrington" color="#814500">The Rose of Odus is dedicated to
restoring the former glory of the arts, through training and study, dedication
and discipline. We help our fellow brethren fight the evils around us, while
seeking to uplift and find kindred spirits who wish to bring order and beauty
back to the arts of magic.</font></p>
<p><font face="Harrington" color="#814500">In this pursuit, we have set the
following ranks for persons studying in the Rose of Odus:</font></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Harrington"><font color="#814500"><b><i><u>Magistrate</u></i></b><O:P>
 </O:P>
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Harrington"><font color="#814500">The first rank is
that of the Magistrate, who is the one who keeps the Rose focused and together.
His duties sometimes include acting as a sage to younger members of the Rose, as
well as the organizer of events related to the Rose of Odus. He will also report
to and advise the Avatar directly on the status of his Rose and it's members, as
well as determining promotions within the Rose of Odus. <b>The current
Magistrate is Bucco.</b></font></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Harrington"><font color="#814500"><b><i><u>Magus</u></i></b><O:P>
 </O:P>
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Harrington"><font color="#814500">The Magus is the
second in command of the Rose. There is only one Magus at any time. The Magus is
tapped from the ranks by the Magistrate, and by permission of the Avatar. Much
of the responsibility for the well being and safety of the Rose falls upon the
Magus and his Sorcerer Protectus, and therefore the Magus is not required to be
a pure caster. <b>The current Magus is Adon Ironhouse. </b><O:P>
</O:P>
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Harrington"><font color="#814500"><b><i><u>Sage</u></i></b><O:P>
 </O:P>
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Harrington"><font color="#814500">The next rank is
that of Sage, or Sorcerer Primus, and is rarely filled. Few find this lifestyle
possible in these times, and so Sages are sometimes not available and the
Magistrate will be called upon to fulfill this position when it is called for.
The role of the Sage is to simply research and be a source of knowledge to the
Brethren. He has no obligation for quests or administrative duties, and is not
bound to the Rose of Odus strictly. Any of the Brethren may call upon him for
information, and may seek his advice and wisdom in times of trouble. He answers
only to the Advisors and the Avatar for direct commands. No other members of the
Rose report to him, although often many previous students continue to offer
personal loyalty and service. A sage will spend much of his time in solitude,
disregarding much that goes on around him. The requirements for the rank of Sage
are known only by Sages, the Magistrate, and the Magistrate's Magus. They retain
all rights and privileges granted by prior ranks.<O:P>
 </O:P>
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Harrington"><font color="#814500"><b><i><u>Mage</u></i></b><O:P>
 </O:P>
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Harrington"><font color="#814500">The next rank is
that of Sorcerer Altus, or Mage. This rank is reserved for those that have
demonstrated extreme loyalty and skill in their art. The few who achieve this
rank are revered highly by their peers, are quite knowledgeable in a large
variety of subjects, and are virtually unparalleled in their talents. They are
an elite, and may be called upon at any time by the advisors or the Avatar to
assist in a difficult situation. Their duties include assigning tasks to
subordinates and fulfilling major quests set out by the advisors and the Avatar,
They retain all rights and privileges granted by prior ranks., including of
Sorcerer Praelium. One may achieve this rank only by arduous work and long hours
of study, by proving themselves on the battlefield, and by recommendation by the
Avatar.<O:P>
 </O:P>
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Harrington"><font color="#814500"><b><i><u>Master

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Harrington"><font color="#814500">The Sorcerer
Praelium are the teachers of the Rose of Odus. Attaining this rank is a
difficult process requiring submission of a thesis upon a specific area of
magecraft in Norrath <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>demonstration
of knowledge of tactics both in group and solo adventuring, spells, and spell
research methods, for all three of the casting professions of Wizard, Enchanter,
and Magician, and testimonials of teaching ability from former students and
apprentices which the Journeyman had tutored under the guidance of a current
Master. <O:P>
</O:P>
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Harrington"><font color="#814500">Once this rank is
achieved, the new Sorcerer Praelium is expected to begin acquiring students and
apprentices. He is expected to be available to them for tutoring on a regular
basis. He may assign tasks and quests to them, and may allow Journeymen to
assist in tutoring under his guidance. He is responsible for their safety, their
learning, and their behavior. Note: Master Sorcerers are knowledgeable in the
tactics of all three pure casting professions, and therefore may have
apprentices from any school, rather than just their specific profession.<O:P>
 </O:P>
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Harrington"><font color="#814500">Sorcerer Praelium
is a voluntary position, and while each Sorcerer a Palaestra is encouraged to
follow this path, some may prefer not to teach. It is not required for the rank
of Mage, although it is a useful step along the way and much more likely to lead
to promotion to Mage.<O:P>

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Harrington"><font color="#814500"><b><i><u>Journeyman

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Harrington"><font color="#814500">The Journeyman
Sorcerer is the first rank with a title, Sorcerer a Palaestra. A Sorcerer a
Palestra has graduated his apprenticeship, and is considered capable of self
teaching through experimentation and research from this point on. Granting of
this rank is given by the Magistrate after two assigned Masters have tested the
candidate’s knowledge of magecraft appropriate to this rank. These tests are
threefold – First, a demonstration of research ability shown by presenting the
Masters with two new spells the candidate has researched, which must be of the
sixth circle (level 20 spells); Second, a demonstration of proficient spell use
in a solo situation; and Third, a verbal examination of the tactics used in
hunting within a group, and working efficiently with other professions.<O:P>
 </O:P>
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Harrington"><font color="#814500">Duties:
Journeymen Sorcerers assist the Brethren with their magic while continuing their
personal growth. Occasionally, they will be assigned a task or quest to be
completed by a superior, but generally they are self-directed. They no longer
require permission to hunt anywhere. They no longer are subject to the commands
of the Master, although personal loyalty and friendship often remain, and they
may choose to remain in the Master’s employ. They may teach students and
apprentices under the guidance of a Master.<O:P>
 </O:P>
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Harrington"><font color="#814500">This is the
highest rank at which one may enter the Rose of Odus. To enter at this rank, one
must complete the tests as stated above, and must have two members of the
Brethren to testify to the Magistrate and Avatar as to your worthiness to join
the Brethren. Either the Magistrate or the Avatar will most likely require other
tests, and there is a one week probationary period for non-apprentices seeking
membership at the Journeyman level..</font></span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Harrington"><font color="#814500">The Apprentice
may or may not have completed a training period as a Student, but in any case
must demonstrate proficiency at the Bind Affinity spell and pass a verbal test
on spell tactics in his specific field of study, to be administered by the
Master who proposes to accept the candidate as an Apprentice. Only Masters may
have Apprentices. Once the Sorcerer Praelium is satisfied as to the
candidate’s worthiness, he will inform the Magistrate who will seek permission
from the Avatar to induct the candidate as a full member of the Brethren.
Acceptance as a Apprentice and as one of the Brethren go hand in hand, and must
be granted simultaneously. Either the Magistrate or the Avatar may require other
tests of worthiness, and there is a one week probationary period, which may have
been completed while a Student.<O:P>

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Harrington"><font color="#814500">Duties:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The Apprentice owes service to the Master, and the Master is responsible
for the development and training of the Apprentice in all aspects of magecraft.
Personal tutelage will be received from the Master, and the Master will assign
tasks and quests to the Apprentice. The Apprentice still must be granted
permission to hunt in a new area. He may bind himself in any city, but to bind
in another area will require the permission of the Master, even if permission is
granted already to hunt in that area.<O:P>

Talon's</a></u></i></b></font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Harrington" color="#814500">It is said that long
ago Tunare sent spirits from the plains to help her children without pride or
prejudice to help those who walk along the path of life.&nbsp; So Tunare would
give these spirits the ability to bond with her children and they would have all
of their strengths and weaknesses.&nbsp; They would be able to travel through
the spirit world from one place on Norrath instantly, they would take the form
of animals and run the wilds, they would be the Talon of Tunare and would bring
her wisdom or become her vengeance.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Harrington" color="#814500">Tunare Talon's is made
up of a pack of tight members whose sole purpose is to guide the Brethren of the
Mystic Dawn on their journeys through life and death, although they fall under
no direct leadership except Tunare.&nbsp; They are there to help the Avatar or
the three heads of the Rose in all their actions including the members within
each order.&nbsp; They sometimes babble or speak in riddles, other times they
take the form of nature herself and cannot be understood.&nbsp; Looking in their
eyes one can see the look of the wild.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Harrington" color="#814500">Tunare grants
membership to the pack through invitation and the bonding of a spirit.</font></p>
