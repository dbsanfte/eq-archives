Ok, the NDA was lifted about a week ago so I can talk and answer questions, unasked or no, in more detail <b></b>(and hopefully not suffer any consequences<b></b>).  Note that I add the caveat of "as of now" a LOT in here because, well, things are changing a LOT even this late in the game, which is my primary concern with EQ2: 7 days to launch and guess what: we are getting radical changes, especialy to tradeskills.<BR>
<BR>
Graphics: top notch.  The landscape is now much like landscape.  Many of the hills and dales feel more like hills and dales than they do in EQ.  The maps are vast <b></b>(in some cases<b></b>) and yet they still feel cosy, somehow.  Plenty of places where you can walk for a long ways and see no other critters, and plenty of places where you can top a hill and be surprised by a group of critters.<BR>
<BR>
Front end/UI: very good.  They've made it so that you have several 10 key hotkey boxes and you can have more than one open at one time.  Thus, 1 is a hot key and if you have 2 hotkey boxes open, <alt>1 will be the first hotkey of the second box.  HPs and Mana are listed as before, as is a "concentration bar" <b></b>(which I've frankly not figured out yet<b></b>).  Exp is now on two tracks: one for adventure exp and one for tradeskill exp.  It's devided into two bars, as it is in EQ, each of which is devided into 10th, so, you can track your exp gain on direct percentages.  The view is letterboxed, so, it's a bane to red necks who can't stand movies the way the director intended them... however, this can be toggled.  Your view, by default, is first person but can be toggled.<BR>
<BR>
Mechanics:<BR>
<BR>
Combat: anyone who is used to EQ will do fine here.  Hit the attack key <b></b>(which is now a hot button<b></b>) and you are flailing away at your opponent.  Each class has different abilities <b></b>(obviously<b></b>) and you will get HOs <b></b>(heroic opportunities<b></b>) based on the conbinations you use.  These combineations, BTW, are very easy to discover, though it's not so intuitive to decipher exactly what the HO wheel is trying to tell you, once you have it figured it's very easy and intuitive.  Pulling is different here.  Critters are marked as solo content with one filled carat "^" or they are marked as group "^^"... I've not yet seen a raid mob but I can assume that the number of "^"s grows with the mobs toughness.  This means you can readily know exactly which mob to pull... but, wait, there's more.  When you target a mob, you may see several of his buddies also hilight, this means that when you pull one... yep, you guessed it, they all come.  No more pacifying a mobs buddies and pulling just the one mob, nothing that I've found breaks this.  There is mez at 10th level and higher, and root, etc, so there are a lot of the old familiar ways to take care of multiple pulls, but, not paci-pulling single.<BR>
<BR>
Once engaged, a mob is locked.  This means no one can come along and KS you.  It also means that they can't help you unless you ask for it <b></b>(there is a limited amout of help that can be given but it's not enough to even mention here<b></b>).  Thus, if you see someone engaged and about to die, there is nothing you can do unless and until they yell for help... which breaks the enoucnter.  When you yell, the mob will still wail on you and kill you if possible, but, a guard will assist at that point <b></b>(if one is nearby<b></b>) and others nearby can now take the kill or heal you.  Note that if you yell you get NO exp or loot.  Note that this means the guards can roam freely through the newbie zone and NOT KS everybody in the zone.<BR>
<BR>
Trivial loot code is in effect, but, it only effects the "rare" loot of each mob.  Ie: you get the average ordinariy every day loot but NOT any special items that might otherwise have dropped... by the way, this is a very key issue as the term "rare" in EQ2 means almost non-existant <b></b>(much debate on this on the boards<b></b>).<BR>
<BR>
Death: when you die, you have two choices: sit and stare at the screen and hope for a rez from someone <b></b>(dead people can't talk so no doing a "/ all priest" and begging for a rez<b></b>), or you revive.  If you get a rez, the exp debt <b></b>(not loss, but, debt<b></b>) is much decreased.  In either case, you come back hale and whole... iirc, you don't even have to loot your body, however, if you choose to revive <b></b>(not get a priests rez<b></b>) you will want to collect your "shard" which is a white copy of your bod left behind when you die.  If you don't collect it, your "spirit" will be decreased.  Personally I've not yet figured out what the downside to not geting your bod is.  As for exp debt, you will see some red in your exp bar, when you get a kill, you will "pay" exp towards this debt until it's elliminated: Gone are the days of the unding.  You will not delevel but you may spend a long time in this level paying off debt.<BR>
<BR>
A note on leveling: if you are good, you should get a level, or two, each night.  As you get higher in level this is harder to accomplish but from all I've seen it's easily doable.  <b></b>(Note: this is NOT true of tradeskills.<b></b>)<BR>
<BR>
Tradeskills: I have a very love-hate relationship with the tradeskills in EQ2:<BR>
<BR>
First: tradeskills are uber complicated but done in such a way that the complexity is fairly transparent.  You start out with about 5 recipes you can combine making tin bars, tin spikes and I think temper for the making of bars and spikes.  The bars, spikes and tempers will be used in later recipes.  So, you learn the basics on really easy recipes that cascade into higher end recipes.  Which is much as we have in EQ1.  Ie: you make recipe A, B, and C to combine into recipe D and make a final product.  Problem is that these subcombines can equate to a LOT of combines, a backpack takes a total of 30 combines... unless you buy the subcombines from another player or from an NPC that sells them, however this affects quality.<BR>
<BR>
Quality?  Yep, each item created is either Crude, Shaped, normal or Pristine.  Pristine obviously being the best. <b></b>(or is it?  More on that in a bit.<b></b>)  Exp is tied to quality, thus you get the least tradeskill exp by making crude product, more with ahsped, still more with normal and the most with Pristine.  Now, you can't make higher quality than that of the primary ingredient in the combine.  This means that if you are making a backpack and want pristine, your Rawhide Plate has to be pristine or you can't make it to pristine.  If it's crude, you'll get, at best, a crude BP.  Start with Shaped, get shaped, etc.  To date, the secondary components quality have NO effect on the quality <b></b>(despite a lot of debating on the boards<b></b>).  This is good in that you can cut corners and only put effort into the primary components... it's bad for what I hope are obvious reasons. <b></b>(Would YOU buy a Back pack with a cool shell, but crappy zipper, straps etc?  Didn't think so.<b></b>)<BR>
<BR>
The combines themselves: Are LONG.  It takes upwards of 2 minutes for ONE combine.  They shortened this but I've not tried it since that was done so am unsure.  Also, they added events into the combine, thus, you have to "fight" with "wrong components", "mislabled componentsw" etc. while doing your combine.  They were attempting to make tradeskills be something that is NOT automated.  Ie: You have to PLAY a tradeskiller rather than botting it or doing it on autopilot.  I applaud them for this goal but am not pleased with the results <b></b>(my opinion, there are many who like it<b></b>).  There has been a major revamp of these but, I crashed before I could get to a tradeskill instance and try this out so am unsure the effect.  Suffice it to say my information may be old at this point but it's close to what will be out there, I'm sure.  Suffice it to say, you won't be doing a click-fest and getting to 250 brewing in a days time... tradeskillers level at about the pace of an adventurer... which is good because the tradeskillers get more respect AND some of the best equipment in the game is tradeskill made... which again is a good thing.  One more update I've not yet seen is that of combines yielding multiple results.  To combat the long combine time, they shortened the combine time and increase the lowest tier combines yield.  Thus, when making temper, it's possible to make several tempers in one combine <b></b>(I'm hoping this eats a commensurate amount of ingredients else we have exploit in a big way<b></b>).<BR>
<BR>
A note on the meaning of "rare."  In EQ2 Rare means next to non-existant.  Which is good because it's a way of differentiating one from another.  Ie: I might find a rare that allows my wizard to get teh best fire spells out there... you might find the rare for the best cold spells.  Odds on neither of us will find both.  Now, tradeskills also use Rares.  Rare books are used to give a character certain recipes.  An example is that there are 10 Rare books for the 1st through 10th levels of tradeskills.  These books give recipes for weapons, armor and spells, among other things.  The spells come in flavors: Apprentice <b></b>(I or III<b></b>), Adept <b></b>(I and III<b></b>) and there are other tiers I've not yet experienced.  Any level character <b></b>(that I've experienced<b></b>) can scribe any level of spell s/he already has in their book.  Thus, I can scribe App III lightning burst at any level as it's a first level spell, but, I can't scribe App III fascinate until 10th level as it's a 10th level spell.  Now, the books are not only rare but interlocked, thus, if you have any one book, you will not have the recipes necessary to make the items in that book.  Ie: you may have the rare book for bronze weapons, but, not the rare book for the temper to make those weapons.  You migh thave the ink recipe but not the recipe for the Adept III spells.  This is good in that the tradeskills are intended to be interdependent.  Thus, my Smith will be dependent on a tailor for Hilts and an Alchemist for Tempers <b></b>(at higher levels<b></b>).  This interdependence has the effect of making a "rare" even more rare by dint of the required combinations.  Further, the recipes require another rare: rare components.<BR>
<BR>
Raw materials: Raw materials are gathered by ground spawn and there are a plethora of ground spawns across the land.  You will quickly fill up on items for combines in no time with little effort.  Everyone can gather these groundspawns and your skill at gathering is tied to your adventuring level.  Personally, I think it should be independent of either tradeskill or adventuring level and instead tied to your skill at the gathering art in question: Foresting, Trapping, Fishing, Mining, to name a few.  Each time you gather from a resource, there is a chance at a rare item.  So far it seems that the higher level the zone, the more likely you are to get a rare of a lower level type.  Ie: if you can get a rare of a particular type in a newbie zone, it becomes less rare in the next zone out.  One caveat: if you gather from a resource and are not high enough level <b></b>(adventurer<b></b>) you will NOT get any rares <b></b>(trivial loot code works both ways<b></b>).<BR>
<BR>
General quests: Both adventuring and tradeskilling have quests <b></b>(well, the tradeskill quests I've not experienced yet but...<b></b>) in point of fact, you are inundated with quests... it's very cool.  It's hard to NOT get quests.  Example:<BR>
<BR>
You start out on a Ship <b></b>(if you choose the tutorial<b></b>) on the ship are various quests that explain the interface and introduce you to the world of EQ2.  Very nice.<BR>
<BR>
You end up on a newbie isle on which are quests for things found on the ground <b></b>(gather quests<b></b>), for tradeskills which are actualy a tutorial on tradeskills, and class related quests.   You can leave the isle with a full suit of armor which ain't shabby if you stay a while and work at it.<BR>
<BR>
Once to town, you have to do a quest to reach level 7: citizenship.  You can do this quest as either an adventurer or a tradeskiller, thus, you may well live your whole EQ2 career as a level 3 adventurer while making level 50 tradeskiller <b></b>(which is VERY good<b></b>).<BR>
<BR>
These quests are well thought out and are very good so far.  They have recently instituted tradeskill quests that generate exp for tradeskill, cash and require <b></b>(or so I'm told, haven't been able to try them yet<b></b>) you to do combines, thus getting exp by dint of doing the combines.  This allows one to tradeskill AND profit while not merely selling back to the NPC.<BR>
<BR>
Flaws:<BR>
<BR>
LAG.  My system is a 1.8GHz machine with the latest and greatest Nvidia GeForce video card with 256M of Video Ram on it.  My network at home is Cable modem and I often guage the speed at nearly 3M <b></b>(and more<b></b>).  Nothing on my system is slouch save that I could upgrade to a faster CPU... and I STILL suffer from lag in a BIG way.  Now, last time I logged on <b></b>(Sunday<b></b>) the lag was pretty good, I was impressed.  Managed to get myself killed scouting out some locations and... crashed to character screen.  Decided to switch characters and... lost connection.  In fairness, that last may have been a local problem <b></b>(the cable HAS been flakey lately<b></b>), but, fact remains that I have evidence that EQ2 is not very stable... yet.<BR>
<BR>
Tradeskill Quality: It's often the case that crude is better than normal, and Shaped better than Pristine.  Go figure, last I knew <b></b>(and my information is unfortunately NOT new<b></b>) this was true despite pointing it out in many a post on the boards.  I'm sure they will fix this but my knowledge right now is they have not.  This makes NO sense to me whatsoever.<BR>
<BR>
Vendor sell for profit: anyone who has been aware of games in the last little while knows that bots are a fact of life.  Anyone who knows human nature knows that if you build a system for which "it can't be done" someone will go out of their way to prove you wrong.  Anyone with a brain would know that if the system is boring, someone will find a way to delete hte boring part of the process.  This all adds up to a lot of incentive to build tradeskill bots in EQ2, despite the anti-bot mechanisms in place, it WILL happen.  Last I checked, several of the tradeskill recipes sold for a profit.  "Wait a minute, Gnarl, I WANT to make money selling my wares and I should!"  I agree with you... but, if I can sell an item to an NPC vendor for even 1cp profit, you and I both know someone will build a bot and milk that 1cp profit for a gajillion copper and crater the economy as has happened in EQ.  It can't be suffered to happen.  However, the recipes can sell back for no loss.  THAT makes sense to me.  It is intended that there will be no profitable recipes <b></b>(when sold to NPCs<b></b>) but to date that has not happened yet <b></b>(7 days to launch<b></b>).<BR>
<BR>
Rares: Folks don't advertise that they want to buy Adept 1 spells... they advertise that they want Adept III spells.  Which requires a rare component AND a rare SET of books.  This means that the Scholar that does not get these books is not a going concern.  This will have the effect of making a relatively low level character being "left out" because s/he didn't get lucky enough to get a drop... further, the books only come from drops.  Wait?  I'm forced to go adventuring to become a better tradeskiller?  Where is the sense here?  At high levels I have no problem with rare drop books only being had by folks going out and killing high level tradeskill mobs <b></b>(weird thought that<b></b>) but I don't consider 10th level a high level.  This kind of disparity and rarity should not occur until after 30th level, imho.  Yet, not only does it occur, it's egregious.  I can't disagree with the thought of rarity and the prestige it lends to someone who manages to get it, but, I dispare at the thought of feeling you HAVE to have an item that requires a 72 hour or more camp <b></b>(Monk epic anyone?<b></b>).  The Trivial Loot Code aggravates this as it's entirely possible to out level the rare drops such that you can't gather them yourselves.<BR>
<BR>
Adventurer dependence: I havde absolutely no faith in adventurers ability to put a fair price on drops or raw materials they gather.  Looking at EQs economy, I see items that are priced well above the sell price of the final item... and that's just ONE component.  I have no reason to believe it won't be as bad or worse in EQ2, and yet, the ONLY people who can gather some of these components are adventurers.  On this mechanic I look with a truly divided heart.  On the one hand it promotes community when folks are dependent on each other this way, on the other hand, I've seen how bad greed gets to be in EQ and have no real hope that EQ2 won't suffer from the same greed and ensuing problems.<BR>
<BR>
Recipes not yet implemented: as of my last understanding, they were crashing Niami DenMother through levels of tradeskills so that she could test recipes at the high end... even given that, many of the recipes have not even been implemented yet <b></b>(as of my last understanding<b></b>), which means they will NOT be tested at release.<BR>
<BR>
The long and short of this is that it feels like Sony is doing it to us again: putting out a half finished product so we can beta test it for them.  It's been 4 years in the making and they didn't have even the combine methodology for the tradeskills done when I first started beta some 2 months ago... for me, this is unacceptable.  The end results will be a fun game, I have no doubt of that, and MANY people will flock to it because of the success of EQ and how well known that name now is.  Having experienced it first hand, both EQ and EQ2, I'm undecided.  I'm not sure I want to be in a world where living in the world 24/7 is the way to get ahead rather than having the best skill in the world <b></b>(that's a nod to rares more than to folks outleveling me because I can only dedicate a finite amount of time to the game<b></b>).<BR>
<BR>
Assuming I'm not kicked out of EQ for this, I'll have more details later.  Ask me questions, I'll answer them and yes, I'm serious, I got a message a week or so ago when I patched EQ2 that the NDA had been lifted and that folks would be getting buddy invites.  I've yet to see any of the Buddy invites but with release next Monday, I wanted to get this out and answer questions that I can first hand before folks jumped out and spent their money.<br></td></tr></table>
