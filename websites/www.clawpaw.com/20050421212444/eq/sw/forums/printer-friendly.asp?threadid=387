I've been game mastering role playing games for almost 30 years at this point.  I started out with Tunnels and Trolls, I played it exactly twice as a player and decided to create my own dungeon.  From that point on I was hooked on being a game master.<BR>
<BR>
Its a rare individual who can toss himself fully into the role of game moderator.  You have to have the right combination of despotic martinet, vastly overinflated ego, absolute impartiality, legendary imagination, and inhumanly rapid problem solving ability.<BR>
<BR>
I feel I possess these qualities in abundance.  Else I would not have been able to attract the quality of player I have over the last three decades.<BR>
<BR>
In order to understand the reasons for my consideration that these qualities are necessary, you have to understand what the game moderator is up against.  I've said it in the past, and I will say it again:  Its not the system, its not the characters, its the fact that you are sitting across the table from 3 to 8 vastly creative individuals, all of whom will be working their imaginations and brain cells overtime to find a solution to whatever problems you put before them.<BR>
<BR>
If you have ever tried to outthink or even challenge just one person, think what it is like to try to outhink and challenge an average of 5 people?  My gods, it can be a nightmare.<BR>
<BR>
And when you factor in the expertise these people have to bring to bear on the situation you place them in....<BR>
<BR>
I have had in my time characters who were:<BR>
<BR>
Trajectory Analysts for JPL<BR>
Professional Writers<BR>
Professional Artists<BR>
Professional Actors<BR>
Professional Poets<BR>
Entomologists<BR>
Archeologists<BR>
Soldiers<BR>
Physicists<BR>
Doctors<BR>
Lawyers<BR>
Economists<BR>
Statisticians<BR>
Educators<BR>
Computer Programmers<BR>
Electrical Engineers<BR>
Mechanical Engineers<BR>
Computer Science Engineers<BR>
Cellists<BR>
Game Designers<BR>
Paramedics<BR>
Construction Workers<BR>
Naval Officers<BR>
Air Force Officers<BR>
Cooks<BR>
University Students<BR>
and the everpopular Unemployed High School Student.<BR>
<BR>
I am some of those things.  I'm not an expert in all those things.  But I've run scenarios where I had to become at least good enough in some of those things to have credibility with the players who were in my game at that time.<BR>
<BR>
Of course, I make Mistakes.  And some of the mistakes are very humorous.<BR>
<BR>
I've been good at only three accents:  Snide BBC English, Faux Pirate, and Faux Wild West.  People expect accents sometimes in RPGs, and they started complaining that all my bad guys sounded like Faux Pirates, so I decided to do a Mexican Bandito bad guy.  <BR>
<BR>
That's where Fiann got the famous "I will rendor your fat to fry my burrito, Gringo!" quote.  I snapped it off on the spur of the moment, in a very bad mexican bandito accent.  It cracked the whole table up.  For a long time.  Never did another mexican bandito bad guy.<BR>
<BR>
Sometimes, players can out clever themselves, as well.<BR>
<BR>
Picture this:<BR>
<BR>
Science Fiction setting, combat armor and space suited players attacking a large robotic tank.  The Players form a brilliant plan, prepare an ambush, and spring it flawlessly.<BR>
<BR>
A fellow playing a combat veterin dropped on the top of the tank, and I said, 'Its electrified!" to which he replies 'My space suit is armored and should insulate me!" to which I replied, "Sure, I agree!"  To which he replied, "I slap my Plastique Charge onto the turret hatch!" to which I replay, "Do you really want to do that, its Electrified!" to which he replied, "My space suit protects me!" to which I replied, "KABOOOOMMMM!!!!, you are blown to flinders!" to which he replied, "Oh, Shit!"<BR>
<BR>
<b></b>(Well, that's not really what he said, I cleaned it up a little<b></b>)<BR>
<BR>
These days, we have all gone over <b></b>(well a lot of us, anyway<b></b>) to computer online gaming.<BR>
<BR>
I will admit, that for me, online will never really replace face to face.  There is something about the embiance of sitting across the table from a bunch of friends with the dice rattling, the glasses clacking, and the pages rustling what a computer cannot replace.  <BR>
<BR>
Computer games online lack the intimacy of real live flesh and blood people.  It doesn't have the spontanaity of real life conversation.  It lacks the creativity of real live players and gms interacting to create a game mystique.  <BR>
<BR>
I realize that many of you didn't come up through the ranks of face to face role players.  You can never know the thrills and chills of a well run scenario.  In fact, for you, those thrills and chills would be difficult, if not impossible to imagine or attain.  <BR>
<BR>
In some ways, I pity those who have never experienced this, and, at the same time, I envy them.  I miss that face to face experience.  I find online gaming a pale imitation.  Unfortunately, for me at this time, its the only game in town.  I only get to play face to face once in a while anymore, and I game master even more seldom.<BR>
<BR>
Next weekend is Hexacon, a game convention here in Phoenix.  I intend to be there, and I intend to recapture some of the magic that computer gaming doesn't give me.<BR>
<BR>
I will be thinking about you all, however, because, to put it bluntly, no matter how many arguments, debates, and rough times we have, I have come to look forward to seeing each and every one of you online.  <BR>
<BR>
Right now, you mean a lot to me as a player.  You are family.<BR>
<BR>
<b></b>(argumentative, impassioned, obstinate, sometimes irritating, but still family.<b></b>)<BR>
<BR>
I hope that we all feel that way.  I think that would bode he best for our guilds and our alliance.<BR>

I come from a multitude of platforms where gaming and roleplaying is concerned, and I agree completely that the 'feel' of a tabletop game can never be matched by a game like EQ.<BR>
<BR>
I started primarily in computers I guess around 1975?  Before PC's were invented.  I soon spent a fortune buying my first computer which I think was a TRS-80 Model 1.   My first experience with 'roleplay' came in the form of a game called 'Zork'.   a text based walkthrough dungeon that let you type text commands like 'get book from table' and 'go north' etc etc...  <BR>
<BR>
Anyway, soon after I bought a Commodore 64, and a modem.  I dialed some local BBS's and enjoyed posting between people, but that was just posting, no roleplay or anything.   I soon got a hankering to run my own BBS, but couldn't afford the $1200 they wanted for an auto-answer modem at that time, so, I bought a book on electronic phone circuits,  built a little $5 circuit that could 'hear' a phone ringing,  and wired it up to the casette jack on the C-64.  Then, using purely assembly code, I wrote a program that could detect the casette jack, and push the modem into auto-answer mode, and walah!  I built my own auto-answer modem.  <img align="absmiddle" src="HTTP://www.clawpaw.com/eq/sw/forums/images/smile.gif"><BR>
<BR>
Well, I took that little program and expanded it into my own version of zork,  only this one could be played by people online, who could also leave me feedback to tell me what they thought of it.<BR>
<BR>
That soon spawned more programming and soon I had a miniature message bbs running on the C-64, but with no real storage capabilities and only 64K of ram,  there wasnt much you could do.<BR>
<BR>
Through this little venture, I met some new friends, some of who had roleplayed, and we gathered ourselves a small group now and again to play. AD&D.  None of us were really very good at it though, but it was a lot of fun.  We really just used off the shelf roleplay scenarios at the time.<BR>
<BR>
I finally bought a computer called a 'Zeus-4' from the company I was working with at the time.  a Zeus-4 is a computer with four processor cards in it, that allowed up to four people to connect to it at the same time, and had a whopping 10-meg hard drive as well.  <b></b>(At that time, 10 meg was like 200gig in todays world<b></b>)   Here, I learned CP/M which was the operating system on it, learned the hardware and learned how to get the cards to talk to each other and to the hard drive.   I wrote a rather impressive BBS that not only supported multiple message boards but multiple phone lines, and I became the first multi-line BBS in my town.<BR>
<BR>
Therein started the real fruition of a new form of roleplaying.   I created a BBS named 'The Dragon's Weyr',  and on it ran a storyboard called "The Shady Dragon Inne"  ...  The Inne took place at the south end of Dragon Pass in the world of Glorantha.  <b></b>(some of you might recognize the ripoff from the game RuneQuest which I fell in love with <img align="absmiddle" src="HTTP://www.clawpaw.com/eq/sw/forums/images/smile.gif"> Here, the main character was Sauron, who was a Dragonewt.  Our bartender was Masterharper Robinton <b></b>(again you might recognize the reference<b></b>) and needless to say the 'line' of the story was not true to form to any given platform, as we soon had spacefaring people and techno and such, but the storyboard did have one particularly fascinating aspect, it was all roleplay and it was all kept tightly within the bounds the people had defined their characters to be!  It was a blast, and by the time I closed the BBS down I had over 50,000 posts on that storyboard.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Throughout all this I met some more friends and our tabletop gaming expanded. We started writing our own modules and my particular favorite type to write is puzzle dungeons.  I moved eventually and lived with some new friends who also roleplayed, and we connected up with some other people who brought Keith Giffen into the fray.  Now he knew how to create dungeons! <img align="absmiddle" src="HTTP://www.clawpaw.com/eq/sw/forums/images/smile.gif">    One of the other people in there was also a master gamer at GenCon and usually ran one of the top ten tables.  Unfortunately I can't remember his name. :/<BR>
<BR>
Well, that soon ended as some of them moved away and finally I moved back to my old haunt as well, and it was there that I discovered another form of online roleplay.   A place called 'The Harper's Tale", an online 'MOO' <b></b>(which stands for MUSH - Object-Oriented,  and MUSH stands for 'Multi User Shared Hallucination'<b></b>)   ... what it was was an entirely text based game, directly interactive with other people.  <b></b>(kind of like an IRC chat, except instead of just chatting you 'exist' in a room, you have posessions, people can 'look' at you and get a description of you. and you can move from room to room like in the real world. every time you entered a new room you would be given the description of the room, and it would also list all the people in the room with you.<b></b>)    It was almost a cross between the old style zork games, an IRC chat room, and everquest.  It was also very highly roleplay oriented.  I created a harper who soon became searched and became a dragonrider.<BR>
<BR>
From there, I once again got the urge to create my own, and I founded 'VirtuaPern' with someone else.  I coded most of the original base of the game and then we had our own verson of 'harpers tale' but due to strife I soon gave up on it. <BR>
<BR>
Then I moved on to a MUSH by the name of "Dark Metal" which was another kind of roleplay. this one was based on the White Wolf roleplay books on vampires and werewolves and mages.   Here is where I met Spiritlynx,  and at the time I was living in Florida and she was living in Michigan.  After about a year of roleplaying we grew closer, and I finally asked her to come visit, bought her a ticket, and we've been together ever since. <img align="absmiddle" src="HTTP://www.clawpaw.com/eq/sw/forums/images/smile.gif"><BR>
<BR>
We as a team created another mush we called 'Children of the Moon'.  it was very much like Dark Metal but more focussed on werewolves. Once again I did most of the initial coding on it while she managed most of the themework. <b></b>(though we both had vastly different opinions on how it should be themed, and on this account we fought often!<b></b>)<BR>
<BR>
We ran that system for almost five years I think, before we finally got fed up with all the strife and closed it down.  As Gnarl very well knows, trying to run the show and be everything to everyone is NOT a fun job!<BR>
<BR>
Here we made the jump to Everquest, and the ability to roleplay comparitively is vastly diminished, but there is a different form of fun in EQ that makes it exciting still to this day, <b></b>(and perhaps the diminished ability to roleplay is actually a boon in its own way<b></b>)<BR>
<BR>
Wow, I think I posted more than Beggly for once. <img align="absmiddle" src="HTTP://www.clawpaw.com/eq/sw/forums/images/smile.gif"><BR>

Some other thoughts came to mind, concerning roleplay and such...<BR>
<BR>
EQ is just not an environment that's roleplay-friendly.  No graphic-oriented game really is.  You have to spend too much time working with the visual image in front of you <b></b>(in my case that would mean pulling, running, and fighting<b></b>) to be able to 'roleplay'.   Roleplay requires a great deal of typing and being in character, and as it is I can hardly get the time to type a sentence, let alone roleplay. <img align="absmiddle" src="HTTP://www.clawpaw.com/eq/sw/forums/images/smile.gif"><BR>
<BR>
Bass as you know him is a happy go lucky anything goes kind of Iksar who presents a rather comedic view of a tail-chasing fiend. <img align="absmiddle" src="HTTP://www.clawpaw.com/eq/sw/forums/images/smile.gif">  If I were to roleplay him you'd see a vastly different character who is dark, brooding, always businesslike, and very gruff.  If I had to put a visual on how he might roleplay,  I'd compare it to the attitude <b></b>(though not the moronicness<b></b>) of the dwarf in the movie Dungeons and Dragons.<BR>
<BR>
In text, I'm an ace roleplayer. In tabletop or real life forms, I suck. <img align="absmiddle" src="HTTP://www.clawpaw.com/eq/sw/forums/images/smile.gif">  I'm no actor and have a terrible shyness about even trying to act out any kind of character in RL,  but give me a keyboard or a pen and I'm a fair hand at telling a story or in roleplaying a character. <img align="absmiddle" src="HTTP://www.clawpaw.com/eq/sw/forums/images/smile.gif"><BR>
<BR>
To give you a clue, here's a story I wrote almost ten years ago.  It's the only one of dozens I used to write that still 'lives'.  I lost all my backups of my BBS and my stories some time ago, and this is the only one that remains:<BR>
<BR>
<a target="_blank" href="http://protovision.textfiles.com/rpg/companion.txt">http://protovision.textfiles.com/rpg/companion.txt</a><BR>
<BR>
Also, since I've been closely watching Horizons,  which will actually have much greater roleplay capacity than EQ does due to the social structure of the game,  I've started another story over the weekend revolving around the game, and have it posted here at <BR>
<BR>
<a target="_blank" href="http://boards.stratics.com/php-bin/stratics/showflat.php?Cat=&Board=hztales&Number=21058&page=0&view=collapsed&sb=5&o=0&what2=postlist&fpart=">http://boards.stratics.com/php-bin/stratics/showflat.php?Cat=&Board=hztales&Number=21058&page=0&view=collapsed&sb=5&o=0&what2=postlist&fpart=</a><BR>
<BR>
... I'd love to be able to get my characters into a roleplay mode, but it is simply impossible to roleplay AND hunt at the same time!<BR>

Nifty history, Bass.<BR>
<BR>
In a way, we both came up through the ranks of our separate trees in much the same way.<BR>
<BR>
I started out as a game master.  I mastered along the way over a dozen different games, and became conversant with hundreds <b></b>(literally<b></b>).<BR>
<BR>
I did all the popular things, AD&D, Runequest, Traveler, Rolemaster, Shadowrun, Chivalry and Sorcery, Middle Earth, Champions, Call of Cthulhu, Boot Hill, etc...<BR>
<BR>
My interests are eclectic, but my great love is super hero rpgs.<BR>
<BR>
I have done my turn at game design, and I've done my turn at playtesting.<BR>
<BR>
I did some computer games along the way as well, Fantasy, Wizardry, Bard's Tale, Might and Magic, Zork, Golden Temple of the Sun, the earliest version of Ultima.<BR>
<BR>
My experiences with role playing in EQ <b></b>(and for that matter, D2<b></b>) is that not only is it hard, but in those situations where it is possible, even a way to pass the time, people are downright hostile toward it.<BR>
<BR>
I tried several times to get Banter role playing going on ships, back in the days when they were the way across oceans if you didn't have a pet druid <b></b>(or ports yourself<b></b>).  My reasoning was:  This is dull.  Everone thinks its dull, let's pass the time with some harmless role playing.<BR>
<BR>
Oops...at the best I was ignored, at the worst I was harranged for being a 'role player nut' and was sometimes put on the Ignore List!<BR>
<BR>
Ok, I got broke of that idea pretty fast.<BR>
<BR>
I think that most of us have fallen into certain 'bits' in guild and group as a way of personalizing our characters more.  SL and her frisky cat persona, you and your tailchaser persona, Iendidar and his wisecracker persona, me and my know it all persona.  These are ways of getting a little personality in the game, which, without it, would quickly relegate itself into a rote monsterkilling fest.  Personally, I outgrew hack and slash a long time ago, and at its heart, EQ and D2 are both hack and slash heaven.<BR>
<BR>
<b></b>(Don't jump on me, sure, there is plenty to do that does not involved killing monsters in both games, but when you come down to it, you can't get anyplace without killing monsters for ep so you can advance or get the tradeskill items or the Cube Recipe items <b></b>(d2 reference<b></b>) you need.<b></b>)<BR>

Hrm, been role-playing when an ex forced me to play tabletop. I was so shy at the time he wanted to do a thesis on the social evolution of the clinically shy when role-playinging is introduced. THis is the guy who forced me to go to convensions in full red star trek uniform btw and forced me to sit and watch the tv shows and movie. However, on the up side.. in meeting his friends who were into it.. met one who introduced me to Elfquest.. then when she found a MUSH online roleplaying text game based on Elfquest cartoons.. showed me the site.. and I was hooked on online roleplaying. 1 year later I dumped the guy, and 5 years later <b></b>(still roleplaying online ww games instead like werewolf and vampire<b></b>), I met Lulu RL as he did the live action vampire game, after running away from his roomie at the time.. we became fast friends. From there I moved around.. and met Bass online on a online roleplaying game, he played a Uktena lupus garou and I was playing a get of fenris kinfolk who was a vet and who's mission was to repolulate rabbits in the zone where wolves roamed. The rest as they say.. is history. <BR>
<BR>
I miss role-playing though. And yes me, neko and others do rp a little on eq.. it's nothing like the days of old when it was text only... moving your fingers through your silken hair as your gaze moved around the room. He stood there, the man in darken leathers with smile that could melt the coldest of hearts. There was something about him, something so beautiful and peaceful.. and suddenly he was there, so close you could feel the warmth of his skin next to yours.. in an instant.. his fangs would sink into your throat.. and the esctasy of it all, made the darkness.. melt into bliss.<BR>

I started gaming with Melee Wizard and Deathtest... well, actualy, I started before that but they were the first non-mainstream games I got that were solidly in fantasy and I was hooked.  I got the original D&D boxed set when it first came out and we tried, oh how we tried, to get that system to work.  We did RP, but, we ended up with the first of the AD&D rules <b></b>(read: the first set of rules that were written in something that was not arcane and was reasonably understandable<b></b>).  Things went downhill from there: STTRPG, C&S, Runequest, Clawlaw <b></b>(or whatever it's called<b></b>), Fantasy Hero, Morrow Project, EarthDawn <b></b>(where Gnarl came from<b></b>), and a host of others whose names escape me <b></b>(and it's driving me nuts that I can't remember some of them<b></b>).<BR>
<BR>
I gamed with Beggly and the crowd in a 2 year game of super hero roleplay <b></b>(Gads, this is frustrating, Hero games published it, what IS the name of it... not like I don't have 4 copies on my shelf<b></b>) GM'd by Beggly, and two other close friends in the Phoenix area.  I also went out of my way to at least understand every game out there well enough to roll a character up in it, so, though I can't say I've campained in every game system, I can say that when I was working for Flying Buffalo Inc, I made it a pint to at least roll up a character in every RPG and understood enough of the mechanics to play.  Quite the undertaking but not nearly as difficult as trying to GM in each of them.<BR>
<BR>
I'm also an avid war gamer <b></b>(or was<b></b>) which is why games like Medal of Honor: Allied Assault and Return to Castle Wolfenstein appeal to me greatly.  Some of the first person shooters, though truly only Hack and Slash games, have very well laid out plot lines and a story that flows well... in fact, the good ones ALL have such a story lines, the bad ones done <b></b>(Quake, though a wonderful engine for FPS, doesn't fit the bill because there was never any rhyme or reason to the characters, just spastic attempts at killing each other... the latest rendition, in fact, was nothing but a constant frag fest, though I could play it and enjoy the competition, it really had nothing to keep ones interest<b></b>).<BR>
<BR>
There you have it... been playing something since the early 70s <b></b>(72 iirc<b></b>), so, call it 30 years... not as long as Beggly can claim but far longer than my father would be pleased to hear about.  <img align="absmiddle" src="HTTP://www.clawpaw.com/eq/sw/forums/images/smile.gif"><BR>

Whelp, Never really done nothing so major as D&D and all that.<BR>
But My roleplaying experience first started, playing the Quest for Glory and King's quest series computer games, <b></b>(yep, i'm part of the computer gaming age<b></b>).  I also had a 3 year stint on a Role playing Chat room, called Vchat, Solace and a few others that were related, where i would Roleplay a character of my choosing and talk with other people. It was a Vampire the Masquerade chat, But i'm not goth so no worries out there.<BR>
Finally got bored with it when everyone left.<BR>
Basically stopped role playing, with actions and such set by making my own character. and Played games like Final Fantasy 7-9<BR>
and then EQ.  Use to play my ranger character, Ogre character <b></b>(did him best <img align="absmiddle" src="HTTP://www.clawpaw.com/eq/sw/forums/images/smile.gif"> <b></b>) and don't really do to much of that anymore.  I could probably have gotten into D&D and stuff like that, but noone around me did it so bleh <img align="absmiddle" src="HTTP://www.clawpaw.com/eq/sw/forums/images/smile.gif"><br></td></tr></table>
