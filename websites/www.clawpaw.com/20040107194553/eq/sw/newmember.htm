<p align="center"><font size="3"><b>So you are just joined Silent
Watchers!&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="3">Congrats to you and to us both! Here is some
information I hope will help you along!</font></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><font size="3">New members get a 30 day probationary period
    - what this means is simple really. When you join our new family, an
    adjustment period is needed so that both YOU and SW is happy with the union.
    Sometimes the fit isn't just right and nobody is happy or sometimes it's a
    match made in heaven. At the first guild meeting that is no less than three
    weeks from being tagged as a guild member, your membership is up for simple
    majority vote of the body of full members. Votes can be cast at the meeting,
    for those who cannot attend, they can be cast by proxy through any officer.
    After the vote, we hope to welcome you as a full member of the guild.
    Failing that, we will be most pleased to help you find a more suitable
    guild.&nbsp;</font></li>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><font size="3">New members can openly discuss any topic at
    the meeting agenda, however until you are voted into the guild with full
    membership rights, you may not yet vote on official poles.</font></li>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><font size="3">New members and Old are asked to refrain from
    asking, begging or hounding anyone in guild or otherwise for Power leveling.
    While we don't hold the PL issue in either good nor bad regard, official SW does not PL any player or alts at anytime.</font></li>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><font size="3">New members and Old are asked to refrain from
    /shouting or /oocly cursing or putting down any other player. Personal
    attacks are not tolerated. If you have a problem with someone, simply /tell
    them. If there is an issue, ask an <a href="leadership.htm">officer of the
    guild</a> to aid you in solving your problem.</font></li>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><font size="3">New members and Old are asked to avoid KS'ing.
    We don't KS other people's kills. *KS - Kill Stealing* A good way to avoid
    this is to /assist your kill target (say a giant in rathe) if someone's name
    appears in your target box, it's taken, don't touch it. If it remains the
    giant's name, it's yours. Simple and effective. Mistakes are made sometimes
    however, we ask you simply apologize and refrain from further confrontation
    and KS. It's not about the loot and goods with SW, it's about being proud of
    your Guild Tag and the family who will stand with you, beside you and behind
    you at all times.</font></li>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><font size="3">New members and Old are required to wear
    their Guild Tag at all times. /role-play is allowed (it doesn't hide your
    tag), but /annon does. We ask you not hide the tag. It makes others feel
    you're up to something or ashamed of your guild. It's a hot topic for those
    so proud to be in the family, it's like your sister turning her face and
    pretending she doesn't know you, it's simply frowned upon.</font></li>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><font size="3">New members and Old are asked to refrain from
    personal attacks and vendetta's on all fronts, from forums to chatter, if
    there's an issue, keep it to /tell's and officers, that's what they're there
    for. Cooler heads always prevail.</font></li>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><font size="3">New members are asked to join the LDCHAT via
    /join ldchat and SERVERWIDE.SWCHAT, so that we can communicate across
    servers and with our allied guilds Loyal Defenders and Children of Tunare.</font></li>
</ul>
<p align="center"><font size="3"><i>Feel at home and welcomed yet? Seems like a
lot but the truth is, it's the simple guidelines stating, be nice, play nice
and we'll all be nice too! Welcome and hope you stay!</i></font></p>
