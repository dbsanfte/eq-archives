I've been game mastering role playing games for almost 30 years at this point.  I started out with Tunnels and Trolls, I played it exactly twice as a player and decided to create my own dungeon.  From that point on I was hooked on being a game master.<BR>
<BR>
Its a rare individual who can toss himself fully into the role of game moderator.  You have to have the right combination of despotic martinet, vastly overinflated ego, absolute impartiality, legendary imagination, and inhumanly rapid problem solving ability.<BR>
<BR>
I feel I possess these qualities in abundance.  Else I would not have been able to attract the quality of player I have over the last three decades.<BR>
<BR>
In order to understand the reasons for my consideration that these qualities are necessary, you have to understand what the game moderator is up against.  I've said it in the past, and I will say it again:  Its not the system, its not the characters, its the fact that you are sitting across the table from 3 to 8 vastly creative individuals, all of whom will be working their imaginations and brain cells overtime to find a solution to whatever problems you put before them.<BR>
<BR>
If you have ever tried to outthink or even challenge just one person, think what it is like to try to outhink and challenge an average of 5 people?  My gods, it can be a nightmare.<BR>
<BR>
And when you factor in the expertise these people have to bring to bear on the situation you place them in....<BR>
<BR>
I have had in my time characters who were:<BR>
<BR>
Trajectory Analysts for JPL<BR>
Professional Writers<BR>
Professional Artists<BR>
Professional Actors<BR>
Professional Poets<BR>
Entomologists<BR>
Archeologists<BR>
Soldiers<BR>
Physicists<BR>
Doctors<BR>
Lawyers<BR>
Economists<BR>
Statisticians<BR>
Educators<BR>
Computer Programmers<BR>
Electrical Engineers<BR>
Mechanical Engineers<BR>
Computer Science Engineers<BR>
Cellists<BR>
Game Designers<BR>
Paramedics<BR>
Construction Workers<BR>
Naval Officers<BR>
Air Force Officers<BR>
Cooks<BR>
University Students<BR>
and the everpopular Unemployed High School Student.<BR>
<BR>
I am some of those things.  I'm not an expert in all those things.  But I've run scenarios where I had to become at least good enough in some of those things to have credibility with the players who were in my game at that time.<BR>
<BR>
Of course, I make Mistakes.  And some of the mistakes are very humorous.<BR>
<BR>
I've been good at only three accents:  Snide BBC English, Faux Pirate, and Faux Wild West.  People expect accents sometimes in RPGs, and they started complaining that all my bad guys sounded like Faux Pirates, so I decided to do a Mexican Bandito bad guy.  <BR>
<BR>
That's where Fiann got the famous "I will rendor your fat to fry my burrito, Gringo!" quote.  I snapped it off on the spur of the moment, in a very bad mexican bandito accent.  It cracked the whole table up.  For a long time.  Never did another mexican bandito bad guy.<BR>
<BR>
Sometimes, players can out clever themselves, as well.<BR>
<BR>
Picture this:<BR>
<BR>
Science Fiction setting, combat armor and space suited players attacking a large robotic tank.  The Players form a brilliant plan, prepare an ambush, and spring it flawlessly.<BR>
<BR>
A fellow playing a combat veterin dropped on the top of the tank, and I said, 'Its electrified!" to which he replies 'My space suit is armored and should insulate me!" to which I replied, "Sure, I agree!"  To which he replied, "I slap my Plastique Charge onto the turret hatch!" to which I replay, "Do you really want to do that, its Electrified!" to which he replied, "My space suit protects me!" to which I replied, "KABOOOOMMMM!!!!, you are blown to flinders!" to which he replied, "Oh, Shit!"<BR>
<BR>
<b></b>(Well, that's not really what he said, I cleaned it up a little<b></b>)<BR>
<BR>
These days, we have all gone over <b></b>(well a lot of us, anyway<b></b>) to computer online gaming.<BR>
<BR>
I will admit, that for me, online will never really replace face to face.  There is something about the embiance of sitting across the table from a bunch of friends with the dice rattling, the glasses clacking, and the pages rustling what a computer cannot replace.  <BR>
<BR>
Computer games online lack the intimacy of real live flesh and blood people.  It doesn't have the spontanaity of real life conversation.  It lacks the creativity of real live players and gms interacting to create a game mystique.  <BR>
<BR>
I realize that many of you didn't come up through the ranks of face to face role players.  You can never know the thrills and chills of a well run scenario.  In fact, for you, those thrills and chills would be difficult, if not impossible to imagine or attain.  <BR>
<BR>
In some ways, I pity those who have never experienced this, and, at the same time, I envy them.  I miss that face to face experience.  I find online gaming a pale imitation.  Unfortunately, for me at this time, its the only game in town.  I only get to play face to face once in a while anymore, and I game master even more seldom.<BR>
<BR>
Next weekend is Hexacon, a game convention here in Phoenix.  I intend to be there, and I intend to recapture some of the magic that computer gaming doesn't give me.<BR>
<BR>
I will be thinking about you all, however, because, to put it bluntly, no matter how many arguments, debates, and rough times we have, I have come to look forward to seeing each and every one of you online.  <BR>
<BR>
Right now, you mean a lot to me as a player.  You are family.<BR>
<BR>
<b></b>(argumentative, impassioned, obstinate, sometimes irritating, but still family.<b></b>)<BR>
<BR>
I hope that we all feel that way.  I think that would bode he best for our guilds and our alliance.<BR>
