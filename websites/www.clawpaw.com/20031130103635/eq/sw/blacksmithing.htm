<p align="left">This is a guide (just one way to working to bsmithing) for
bsmithing 0-250.</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><b>0-26 = </b>you can sharpen weapons by killing some orcs in gfay and get rusty weapons buy a sharpening stone and putting it into forge. success you get new weapon and this is the cheapest way. other way is to make metal bits by combining 2 small pieces of ore into a forge these trivial at 18. DO NOT throw those away.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><b>26 - 74</b> = Make spoons by combining a scaler mold two metal bits and a water flask.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><b> 75-115</b> = This were you start making armor (bum bum buuuuum) two small bricks and water flask in forge make metal sheets and you will need LOADS of these. banded armor is made by combining 1, 2, or 3 sheets depending on what armor piece you working on. the best way to work this is bracers (1 sheet
    trivial at 95) helmets (2 sheets <b>trivial at 106)</b> and last mails (3 sheets
    <b>trivial at 115</b>).&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><b>116-162</b> is a killer. you will start making ornate chain armor. you need lots and lots and lots of money for this cause its expensive. you start by making high quality rings which is made by combining large brick of high quality ore, file, and flask of water. the large bricks of high quality or is LIMITED so the
    merchant will run out. either restock him by doing his quest or wait for a patch to restock him. you will also need silver bars (oy!!!). not sure what the
    trivial is on these but when it trivial's move to next piece. bracers take chain bracer pattern, smithy hammer, silver bar, water flask, 1 high quality ring. then move to ornate coifs which takes the same recipe except you need 2 high quality rings. then mails which is same but takes 3 high quality rings. Your not out of the woods yet!!! once your trivial with the chain mail tunic you need to replace the silver bar with an electrum bar and start all over again with bracers to coifs to mails. its same recipes but you just change the bar. then once those are trivial you will bar gold bars to replace the electrum. follow same pattern. once gold bars are finished the next is platinum bars.
    <b> DO NOT DO PLATINUM BARS SKIP THAT STEP.</b> the platinum bars is unbelievable
    stupid for smiting cause you have to go through a butt load.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left"> kk next is plate molds hehe.<b>168-188</b> is trivial. you will need ALOT of leather
    padding. you will also need medium quality ore which is more expensive then high quality (about 20 plat a piece and you need
    a lot of those too O_o) combine mq ore with smithy hammer and flask of water to make folded sheets of metal. with the folded sheets of metal you will make bracers. 1 folded sheet of metal, bracer mold, leather padding, and smithy hammer. 2 folded sheets for helmets once bracers
    trivial and 3 folded sheets for breastplates once helmets trivial.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Finally at 189 aren't you proud of yourself. this is were smithys get to relax because everything is farmed and can be sold in bazaar for some nice plat. two methods to get from
    <b> 189 to 250</b>. one is shadow scream steel and the other is acrylia armor. To make ACRYLIA armor you will need lots of large bricks of acrylia. also buy a combine smithy hammer from katta castellium. you will need combine acrylia temper which is brewed by combining crushed
    windstones, essence of wind, and clear vial of mana. first turn the large bricks of acrylia ore into rings by combining large brick of acrylia, file, and water flask, (makes 2). right now you should just make the chain tunic cause oddly enough at this point
    I was trivial to the lower stuff. so combine 3 acrylia rings, a chain tunic pattern, combine smithy hammer, and combine acrylia temper into forge. sell these in bazaar cause it seems no one in guild wants em lol. for the plate armor you need to make acrylia chain jointing which is made by combine 1 ring of
    acrylia, file, water, and combine smithy hammer. also make folded sheets of acrylia. combine a BLOCK of acrylia, water flask, and a normal smithy hammer (not the combine smithy hammer) to make folded sheets. then combine folded sheet of acrylia, chain jointing, bracer mold, combine smithy hammer, and acrylia temper in forge. once
    trivial on bracer move to helmets which take to folded sheets of acrylia. once trivial with those make breastplate which take 3 folded sheets. THAT is one way to get to 250 the other way is to make shadow scream steel armor. you will need to complete the quest in shar vahl to get your luclinite hammer and vah shir anvil. farm lots of swirling shadows which drop of shades in shadeweaver and farm shrieking substance from wolves and wailing substance from owlbears in hollow shade moore. best way for the substance farming is to take whats on the island since they drop
    a lot there. make humming orbs by combining 1 shrieking substance 1 wailing substance your vah shir anvil and your luclinte hammer with metal rings (metal rings are made by combining large brick of ore, file, and water) this makes humming orbs which are trade able but do not stack so make enough to feel one bag hehe. way to work this up is to buy bracer sectional mold (yep
    that's what they called) because bracers are trivial to 250 and seem to be the easiest to make. combine bracer sectional mold, 1 humming orb, 2 swirling shadows, luclinite hammer, vah shir anvil, and water flask and you have a bracer (trivial 250).&nbsp;</li>

<p align="left"> WELL that's all I can teach you about smiting from 1 to 250. all info was
received from eq traders and my personal experiences hehe. with loads o love,<br>
