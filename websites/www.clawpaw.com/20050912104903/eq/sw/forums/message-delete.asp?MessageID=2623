I come from a multitude of platforms where gaming and roleplaying is concerned, and I agree completely that the 'feel' of a tabletop game can never be matched by a game like EQ.<BR>
<BR>
I started primarily in computers I guess around 1975?  Before PC's were invented.  I soon spent a fortune buying my first computer which I think was a TRS-80 Model 1.   My first experience with 'roleplay' came in the form of a game called 'Zork'.   a text based walkthrough dungeon that let you type text commands like 'get book from table' and 'go north' etc etc...  <BR>
<BR>
Anyway, soon after I bought a Commodore 64, and a modem.  I dialed some local BBS's and enjoyed posting between people, but that was just posting, no roleplay or anything.   I soon got a hankering to run my own BBS, but couldn't afford the $1200 they wanted for an auto-answer modem at that time, so, I bought a book on electronic phone circuits,  built a little $5 circuit that could 'hear' a phone ringing,  and wired it up to the casette jack on the C-64.  Then, using purely assembly code, I wrote a program that could detect the casette jack, and push the modem into auto-answer mode, and walah!  I built my own auto-answer modem.  <img align="absmiddle" src="HTTP://www.clawpaw.com/eq/sw/forums/images/smile.gif"><BR>
<BR>
Well, I took that little program and expanded it into my own version of zork,  only this one could be played by people online, who could also leave me feedback to tell me what they thought of it.<BR>
<BR>
That soon spawned more programming and soon I had a miniature message bbs running on the C-64, but with no real storage capabilities and only 64K of ram,  there wasnt much you could do.<BR>
<BR>
Through this little venture, I met some new friends, some of who had roleplayed, and we gathered ourselves a small group now and again to play. AD&D.  None of us were really very good at it though, but it was a lot of fun.  We really just used off the shelf roleplay scenarios at the time.<BR>
<BR>
I finally bought a computer called a 'Zeus-4' from the company I was working with at the time.  a Zeus-4 is a computer with four processor cards in it, that allowed up to four people to connect to it at the same time, and had a whopping 10-meg hard drive as well.  <b></b>(At that time, 10 meg was like 200gig in todays world<b></b>)   Here, I learned CP/M which was the operating system on it, learned the hardware and learned how to get the cards to talk to each other and to the hard drive.   I wrote a rather impressive BBS that not only supported multiple message boards but multiple phone lines, and I became the first multi-line BBS in my town.<BR>
<BR>
Therein started the real fruition of a new form of roleplaying.   I created a BBS named 'The Dragon's Weyr',  and on it ran a storyboard called "The Shady Dragon Inne"  ...  The Inne took place at the south end of Dragon Pass in the world of Glorantha.  <b></b>(some of you might recognize the ripoff from the game RuneQuest which I fell in love with <img align="absmiddle" src="HTTP://www.clawpaw.com/eq/sw/forums/images/smile.gif"> Here, the main character was Sauron, who was a Dragonewt.  Our bartender was Masterharper Robinton <b></b>(again you might recognize the reference<b></b>) and needless to say the 'line' of the story was not true to form to any given platform, as we soon had spacefaring people and techno and such, but the storyboard did have one particularly fascinating aspect, it was all roleplay and it was all kept tightly within the bounds the people had defined their characters to be!  It was a blast, and by the time I closed the BBS down I had over 50,000 posts on that storyboard.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Throughout all this I met some more friends and our tabletop gaming expanded. We started writing our own modules and my particular favorite type to write is puzzle dungeons.  I moved eventually and lived with some new friends who also roleplayed, and we connected up with some other people who brought Keith Giffen into the fray.  Now he knew how to create dungeons! <img align="absmiddle" src="HTTP://www.clawpaw.com/eq/sw/forums/images/smile.gif">    One of the other people in there was also a master gamer at GenCon and usually ran one of the top ten tables.  Unfortunately I can't remember his name. :/<BR>
<BR>
Well, that soon ended as some of them moved away and finally I moved back to my old haunt as well, and it was there that I discovered another form of online roleplay.   A place called 'The Harper's Tale", an online 'MOO' <b></b>(which stands for MUSH - Object-Oriented,  and MUSH stands for 'Multi User Shared Hallucination'<b></b>)   ... what it was was an entirely text based game, directly interactive with other people.  <b></b>(kind of like an IRC chat, except instead of just chatting you 'exist' in a room, you have posessions, people can 'look' at you and get a description of you. and you can move from room to room like in the real world. every time you entered a new room you would be given the description of the room, and it would also list all the people in the room with you.<b></b>)    It was almost a cross between the old style zork games, an IRC chat room, and everquest.  It was also very highly roleplay oriented.  I created a harper who soon became searched and became a dragonrider.<BR>
<BR>
From there, I once again got the urge to create my own, and I founded 'VirtuaPern' with someone else.  I coded most of the original base of the game and then we had our own verson of 'harpers tale' but due to strife I soon gave up on it. <BR>
<BR>
Then I moved on to a MUSH by the name of "Dark Metal" which was another kind of roleplay. this one was based on the White Wolf roleplay books on vampires and werewolves and mages.   Here is where I met Spiritlynx,  and at the time I was living in Florida and she was living in Michigan.  After about a year of roleplaying we grew closer, and I finally asked her to come visit, bought her a ticket, and we've been together ever since. <img align="absmiddle" src="HTTP://www.clawpaw.com/eq/sw/forums/images/smile.gif"><BR>
<BR>
We as a team created another mush we called 'Children of the Moon'.  it was very much like Dark Metal but more focussed on werewolves. Once again I did most of the initial coding on it while she managed most of the themework. <b></b>(though we both had vastly different opinions on how it should be themed, and on this account we fought often!<b></b>)<BR>
<BR>
We ran that system for almost five years I think, before we finally got fed up with all the strife and closed it down.  As Gnarl very well knows, trying to run the show and be everything to everyone is NOT a fun job!<BR>
<BR>
Here we made the jump to Everquest, and the ability to roleplay comparitively is vastly diminished, but there is a different form of fun in EQ that makes it exciting still to this day, <b></b>(and perhaps the diminished ability to roleplay is actually a boon in its own way<b></b>)<BR>
<BR>
Wow, I think I posted more than Beggly for once. <img align="absmiddle" src="HTTP://www.clawpaw.com/eq/sw/forums/images/smile.gif"><BR>
