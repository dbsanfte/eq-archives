      <h1><font face="Arial">Thierry's Story</font></h1>
      <p><font face="Arial"><br>
      <br>
      <font size="4">  Thierry lay hidden, watching as the young elven girl entered the clearing, looking over her shoulder, she turns and relaxes. He sighs inward, so young he though, but weren't they all he asked himself silently.&nbsp;<br>
       &nbsp;<br>
  Her beautiful tanned face, that of a child, yet belonging to a women. She walked over and paused by the pond in the middle of the clearing. There she stands staring at the image in it. Standing behind her, Thierry knew the silvery surface would show nothing but her own reflection against the evening sky. Though he was close enough to touch her.&nbsp;<br>
       &nbsp;<br>
  He considered what she would do if he materialized behind her. He could do so with merely a thought, but he had no wish to terrify her. Especially not now, as she kneeled reaching out to touch the silvery surface before her, gentle fingers brushing across the reflection of her face.&nbsp;<br>
       &nbsp;<br>
  Thierry so eagerly wondered what she was thinking. With a slight sigh she began to unbutton her blouse, tossing it away. The silk fluttered down into creamy ripples upon the ground. Her hips swaying as she crosses back to a near by tree where she has left her pack, she bends over slowly Thierry watching her every move, the reactions of the muscles in her thighs under her smooth skin. She reaches into the pack and begins to rustle through it. The air smelled of her, Thierry drank in the sent and sighed again longingly before turning to watch as she crossed back to the pond.&nbsp;<br>
       &nbsp;<br>
  She pulls a dagger from her waist and drops it to the ground a soft "thud" reverberates through the clearing. As though without though she slowly undoes the button of her pants, sliding them off. Dark blue jean material giving way to soft tan skin, she kicks them away to lay near her blouse.&nbsp;<br>
       &nbsp;<br>
  Standing there she was pure radiance. Thierry willed himself to ignore the display and concentrate on her face. She stepped closer to the pond, then stepping in gingerly she washes cold, clear water over her exposed body. Closing his eyes, he just listens. "You were once this young weren't you Thierry......" the voice in his head trailing off as he opens his eyes suddenly. The sound of silk moving across skin is heard. He watches has the now tight wet blouse sticks to her skin, clinging to her body as though it where some sentient being not wanting to let her go. She buttons it slowly, before reaching for her pants. Those tight jeans sliding up over her perfect thighs as he watches her button them then reach for her belt and dagger.&nbsp;<br>
       &nbsp;<br>
  She shakes her head, as her long dark hair tumbles down over her shoulders. He watched her every move from the scintillating dance she now did to the small subtle movements of her hands as she gathered items for her pack.&nbsp;<br>
       &nbsp;<br>
  No matter how many times he observed her, his fascinations never lessened. So like myself he though. The light that danced around her caused images that made his heart burn.&nbsp;<br>
       &nbsp;<br>
  A snapping twig heard suddenly. "Over here !" a husky voice is heard through the trees. "she is near-by, come !" Hearing the voices of the men she looked at the reflection in the pond once more, and shock her head. Then turning her back to the pond she snatched up her pack and disappeared back into the forest. Silence engulfs the clearing once more.&nbsp;<br>
       &nbsp;<br>
  He stood there in the darkness of the shadowy trees alone, listening to the patter of her feet across the forest floor. He knew her name, her description. Tonight as he often did he would follow her. Thierry walked to the tree she had been standing near. Off the ground he picked a small crescent moon shaped charm, letting it slide down his fingers and coming to rest in the palm of his hand. Standing there, thinking of her, thinking of her light and his darkness. he forgot himself as his gaze drifted across to the pond.&nbsp;<br>
       &nbsp;<br>
  Two red glints appeared, strangely glimmering beneath the surface of the pond. "Veridian !" His stomach was in sudden knots, his teeth clenched.&nbsp;<br>
      The two burning slits of red grew brighter against the surface of the pond. Wisps of crimson smoke began to drift upward from the blazing eyes.&nbsp;<br>
       &nbsp;<br>
  A familiar voice filled his head, hissing and growling his body becoming encased in a unbearable heat, though there where no flames about him. "Thierry." the voice said. "My lord." he whispered.&nbsp;<br>
       &nbsp;<br>
      "My own gallant darkling, Thierry..... the honorable Prince of Darkness." the voice mused as if it were speaking of the features of it's most prized possession. The sound of the voice wrapped him in it's coils, he could feel the pressure as it became suddenly hard to breath.&nbsp;<br>
       &nbsp;<br>
  "Yes, Lord ?" Thierry managed to say between gasps of air. "Are you well this evening?" came the voice. "Quite well my lord" Thierry squeaked.&nbsp;<br>
       &nbsp;<br>
      "I rejoice in this news." came the voice booming with laughter. "Do inform me, my trusted Thierry, of your mission here. I'm curious." Thierry swallows hard as he says "I am merely watching my lord." "As am I. Such a fragile flower, is she not ?" The dragons gaze bore into him. "And of course, one so easily crushed. Like all such flowers !" Sudden heat flared in Thierry's brain, he knew better then to try and evade the flames. He swallowed and said nothing.&nbsp;<br>
       &nbsp;<br>
  The slit like eyes narrowed, smoke continuing to pour from their rims. "Ah, my Thierry. For the moment I chose not to crush your little flower. I am not small, I won't begrudge you your petty amusements."&nbsp;<br>
       &nbsp;<br>
  "Thank you my lord." he said as the ground came up suddenly to meet him as he fell. The Dragon his lord was gone.&nbsp;<br>
       &nbsp;<br>
      ***********************Chapter 2*******************&nbsp;<br>
       &nbsp;<br>
      Tyrina, fleet footed elf that she was led the bounty's on a wild trail all through the night. Backtracking she retraced her trail again, and again yet sometimes breaching it. "Damn." she sighs. "They are very persistent tonight." "Never have they been so predatory in their hunts." she said to herself. A rustle in the leaves of the above trees, she spins around to come face to face with another elf. A weary smile on his face "Evening Tyrina." he says.&nbsp;<br>
       &nbsp;<br>
      &quot;Kynok !" she glares at him. "What. Sorry if you had your guard down, it's not my problem." Without missing a beat he adds "Oh an neither are your little bounty hunter friends, it's your head they want." He takes a step back still smiling as he laughs. "I'm....." she starts to say but once again without a trace, he is gone as quickly as he came.&nbsp;<br>
       &nbsp;<br>
  "Damn, Kynok ! One of these days I will catch you." she yelled. "That day shall not be soon dear sister, for I have been around much longer then you little one."&nbsp;<br>
  As Kynok swung though the forest canopy he wondered just how capable was Tyrina of fending off her pursuers. I hope Valchan and Kyrinn haven't started their evening hunt yet. For I may need their help. He thought silently.&nbsp;<br>
       &nbsp;<br>
  Valchan and Kyrinn where twins, and Kynok's best friends. You could always count on them for help. Kynok made a quiet landing on the forest floor just outside Valchan's home, weary not to spoke the two.&nbsp;<br>
       &nbsp;<br>
      &quot;Valchan.&quot; he yelled up towards the tree house. "Kynok ? Is that the voice of...." "Don't even finish that sentence." Kynok said firmly. He hated being referred to as the "Failed Ranger." A loud bellowing laugh came from the house as Valchan walked out.&nbsp;<br>
       &nbsp;<br>
  The elf shook his head then brushed his unkempt dirty blond hair out of his face. He was a tall one indeed. Standing a good foot taller then Kynok. Yet at the same time Valchan was one of a thick build. At first glance you might think this gent to be a human, alas for those sharply pointed ears.&nbsp;<br>
       &nbsp;<br>
  Valchan dives out of the tree house landing just as silently as Kynok did despite his large size. Standing up he says "Ok, ok, I didn't mean to ruffle your feathers. Man aren't you the serious one today. So Kynok, what's up now ?" the larger elf asked.&nbsp;<br>
       &nbsp;<br>
      &quot;Tyrina needs help, but she won't admit it." At that moment Kyrinn came crashing though the clearing. Pushing his chest out with a huff. "Nobody touches her and gets away with it without dealing with me...."&nbsp;<br>
       &nbsp;<br>
  "Hold up, listen Kyrinn. I need your help and so does my sister." Kynok puts a hand on his friends shoulder. "But your brute strength is not required right now." After a few more moments the three retreated to the safety of the tree house.&nbsp;<br>
       &nbsp;<br>
  A few hours later the three emerged from the house and all bound off in the same direction, all determined to find Tyrina before the bounties did. As the dawn was birthing the beginning of another day the three found themselves on the cold, dead trail of Tyrina. None of them quite sure what to make of it, nor how to handle this unwanted discovery.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
