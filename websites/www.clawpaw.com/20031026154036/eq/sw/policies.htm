<p align="left"><b><i>What we are not ...&nbsp;</i></b></p>
<p align="left">Lets begin with a tale of a unified family. Unlike some guilds,
Silent Watchers on Cazic-Thule Server is not about UBER loot,&nbsp; Power leveling
or the &quot;GIVE ME&quot; mentality. If that is what you seek, we are not for
you. We are not about grabbing as much as we can and making oodles of cash. We
are not about power leveling new alts or about seeing to it you get something
done to the exclusion of other guild members. We are not about 'Look what I have&quot; mentality, it's not our
nature to show off to make others feel weak, but about sharing successes. Some
guilds love this mentality and perhaps you might as well also, we are glad if
you find each other and be joyous. However, if you want something else, family,
unity .. let me tell us what we are...</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><b><i>What we are..&nbsp;</i></b></p>
<p align="left">Silent Watchers is a family. We have our parents which are our
leaders and even though leadership does exactly that, lead, we all have an equal
voice. We are NOT lead by dictatorship, our Guild Master Gnarlianna prefers to
lead with open communication and respect. We even hold votes when things are
between unwritten lines. This has always been the way of the Silent Watchers. If
this sounds like something you'd enjoy, please read on!</p>
<p align="center"><font size="3"><b><u><img border="0" src="../../images/filigreemidgold.gif" width="499" height="38"></u></b></font></p>
<p align="left"><b><i>Meetings:</i></b></p>
<p align="left">Silent Watchers tries to hold it's meeting once a month, usually
on a Sunday unless Saturday works best for most involved. We have an agenda and
open discussions and votes. New members must be within the guild 30 days before
they're allowed to vote, though they can speak up at anytime during the meeting.
An example of a vote is simple. New member applied to the guild, had 3 sponsors
and now 30 days has passed, their probationary period as well as our own has
come to an end. The
guild now votes to either accept our new member or perhaps wish him/her well in
seeking a new home, perhaps the fit was not as what we all would have best
enjoyed. To be honest, very very few have not found a fit with us, our
sponsorship program aids our new members find their niche.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><b><i>Humor:&nbsp;</i></b></p>
<p align="left">Lets be blunt here, Silent Watchers is full of silly fun people.
We're like family so we tend to giggle and laugh quite a bit. The overly serious
tend to shy away from such members who might give you a weggie but not us!
During raids the mood sometimes grows quite serious, no one likes to die of
course, but a good well placed noogie always brightens my day!</p>

<p align="left"><b><i>Tradeskilling: (see our webpage on<a href="tradeskills.htm">
Tradeskill Tips</a>)</i></b></p>
<p align="left">Silent Watchers is a very Tradeskill intense guild. It's totally
optional and if you wish to try to skill up, we're more than happy to try to
help you. Others are skilling also so we do have a Tradeskill Coordinator, Ykina/Ixiola
who is an Officer within the guild. She is a master Tinker, Fletcher, and too
many others to name! Remember, you never HAVE to Tradeskill, some do enjoy
donating items so they too may reap the rewards of stated food or tailored
items. Talk to the guild and see where you can help or be helped, just remember
the simple outline. Never abuse others and you will never be abused. So sayith
the Lynx.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Please know that the Silent Watchers Guild, unlike so many
others help our fellow tradeskillers. Any donations made are just that, voluntary
and completely your choice. You never MUST donate. Period. However, many have
found donating items reeps them the benefits of token goods in return such as
Halas Pies! Also know that many of our tradeskillers would gladly hit the
combine for you at NO CHARGE EVER. You supply the goods and we will hit the
button, though success rates vary, like with all tradeskills, they can be
FAILED. If you lack the goods but wish a tradeskilled item from one of our
tradeskiller (example: Anayarie making you a Tunare Idol, she is our highest
Guild Potter), you could pay the &quot;COST&quot; of making the item and that's
all! It's how we say thank you for donations, it's how tradeskillers of the
guild can afford to swallow some loss.&nbsp;</p>
