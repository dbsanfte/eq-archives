<p align="left">Hi to those who want to learn the art of fletching. I was given
this list of recipes, and will post them here so that you will know the trivials
on arrows you may attempt to make and as a guideline to help you along your way
to being a 200 skill fletcher.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"> IF YOU NEED TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT FLETCHING,
IXIOLA IS THE PREMIER FLETCHER/BOWYER!. She knows the ins and outs of arrows and
bows, and is THE knowledge source for any bow or arrow you may want to attempt.
This trivial listing is being posted as a pathway to a higher skill level only.</p>
<p align="left"><br>
I received this list from a player in-game, while trying to get Miyke high
enough to make Selyorb some damage one/ range 150 arrows. : )<br>
<br>
There are <b><u>two routes</u> </b>you can take, one with recipes for skill
only, the next is for usable arrows.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><b><i><u>The first, skill only list, goes as follows.</u></i></b><br>
<br>
Triv 16 Rng:50 Damage 1<br>
Field point; Wood shaft; round fletches; Large nock<br>
<br>
Triv 36 Rng:75 Damage 1<br>
Same ingredients, but change to Medium nock<br>
<br>
Triv 46 Rng?100 Damage 1<br>
Same as TRIV 16 arrows, but change to Parabolic Fletch<br>
<br>
Triv 56 Rng:100 Damage 1<br>
Same as TRIV 16 arrows, but change to Small nock<br>
<br>
Triv 68 Rng:50 Damage2<br>
Field point; Bone shaft; Round fletches; Large nock<br>
<br>
Triv 82 Rng:0 Damage 2<br>
Field point; Wood shaft; shield fletches; Large nock<br>
<br>
Triv 102 Rng:50 Damage 2<br>
Hooked point; Wood shaft; Round fletches; Large nock<br>
<br>
Triv 122 Rng:25 Damage 2<br>
Field point; Wood shaft; Wood vanes; Large nock<br>
<br>
Triv 135 Rng:50 Damage 3<br>
Field point; Ceramic shaft; Round fletches; Large nock<br>
<br>
Triv 162 Rng:75 Damage 2<br>
Field point; Wood shaft; Bone vanes; Large nock<br>
<br>
Triv 182 Rng:50 Damage 3<br>
Silver tip; Wood shaft; Round fletches; Large nock<br>
<br>
Triv 202 Rng:50 Damage 3<br>
Field Point; Wood shaft; Ceramic vanes; Large nock<br>
<br>
NOTE THAT THE LAST TRIVIAL IS 202 - PASSING 200 MEANS YOU HAVE TO USE AA POINTS
BEFORE YOU CAN RAISE ANOTHER SKILL PAST 200 if you already have a 200+
tradeskill.<br>
<br>

There they are, the arrows that can take you to a skill level of 200. This is
not the only route to take, of course, and I am positive there are many other
paths to take. As I said, Ixiola is THE fletcher/boyer and can guide you as you
go along. She knows many of the more advanced arrows and bows that can be player
made.&nbsp; <img src="HTTP://www.clawpaw.com/eq/sw/forums/images/smile.gif" align="absMiddle" width="16" height="16"><br>
