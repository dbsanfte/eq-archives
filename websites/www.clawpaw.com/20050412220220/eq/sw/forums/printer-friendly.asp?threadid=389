Sorry that I was late last night.  More, I'm sorry we failed to take down Fay.  Worse, I'm not sure exactly where we failed.  We were a little low in healing, but, not, I thought, critically so.  We were also a little low in DPS but not, again, critically so <b></b>(again, I thought<b></b>).  Apparently we moved just slightly too far to the underpowered side.<BR>
<BR>
I did, however, note that the pet was on Fay quick <b></b>(and died<b></b>).  I think that was in response to Fays AoE spell.  Fay also made a beeline for Hyrin <b></b>(33rd level Bard<b></b>) as I saw him on the beach getting pummelled.  Long and short is that I'm thinking a lower level tank for bait might work well.  As for pets, it's my observation that they do not seem to affect Fays behaviour, they are just speed bumps.  <b></b>(I cast my pet just at turn in time and he was in just in time to catch aggro as I got hit with the first AoE.<b></b>)  That said, I'm willing to try it again without pets to see if we can control Fay... I'm thinking we pull in a lower level tank to see if she makes for the tender meat shields first... and can volunteer a 43rd level Paladin for the job.  <img align="absmiddle" src="HTTP://www.clawpaw.com/eq/sw/forums/images/smile.gif"><BR>

Unlike your experience, my pet <b></b>(and not my studliest pet by any means<b></b>) lasted teh whole time, not taking significant damage from Fay's attacks...and I don't know why, it's not supposed to be immune.  In any event, it did not die until I died, and it was on Fay, I saw it, having used See Invis as a junk buff, I saw it head for Fay from the first hit I took.<BR>
<BR>
I think that the jury is way out on what good pets do or don't do in this.  I know my earth and fire pets did not fair nearly as well as my air pet, and I have not tried water.<BR>
<BR>
I think this is stuff you can only learn experience.  Certainly, I lasted a long time, I died after most of the tanks and all the healers....and that is mostly because of my self resist buffs...when they went, along with Iendidar's buffs, I died...course, it was a moot point at that point, Fay popped me with claws...like an overinflated balloon.<BR>
<BR>
And Iendidar's heals were mega useful in keeping me alive that long, Fay was hitting me for about 30 points less than Ien's heal.<BR>
<BR>
Long and short:  Need more healers, more tanks, maybe more nukers.<BR>
<BR>
When I got damage off <b></b>(and I was using my nuke dot<b></b>), I got full damage, but Fay has VERY good resists, so many times I nuked only to fizzle.  Since he's a fire dragon, I didn't use fire nuke, the magic based dot/nuke is my only option.  A Wizzie with Cold might have been useful, or a Necro with drains and poison dots.<BR>
<BR>
We had him down to 1/4 alive, we could have taken him with just a little more, we were VERY close, and is not anyone's fault we died.  I think it could have gone either way with just a little more luck on our side, Fay would have died.  Even a couple more failed saves on his part could have swung the pendulum our way.<br></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" class="messagecellheader2" align="right"><a class="headerlink2" href="#top">^ Top</a></td></tr><tr>

Fay was resisting my nukes like a champ, and they are pure magic based.  Hmm... when I say resist, I mean that either Fay resisted fully, or the damage was like 56 where I normally do close to max: 675.  I DID Tashania Fay <b></b>(-39 MR<b></b>), and I'm sure it made a difference, but, Fay still resisted me in a big way.  Glad to hear you were tagging hard.  <img align="absmiddle" src="HTTP://www.clawpaw.com/eq/sw/forums/images/smile.gif"><BR>

You would have tagged him harder had you hit, my dot/nuke is 350 plus 90 per tick.  However, in the end, I think it was just bad luck.<BR>
