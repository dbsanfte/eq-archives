        <ul>
          <li>Instead of role-playing hitting someone, instead role-play the
            attempt to allow someone to counter the action.</li>
          <li>Instead of *laugh* as a emote, try : or /emote laughing madly. Elaborate
            so that it aids the person role-playing with you in
            emoting back. (Example: John laughs.&nbsp; vs. John laughs as Joann
            gets hit with spear in the bottom. &quot;Lass, I think that gnoll
            likes more of you than you're willing to endure! Should I leave you
            two alone?&quot;)</li>
          <li>Don't ignore the poses of others. If you pose tossing a cold fish
            (while on a fishing trip in Cobalt Scar), to Jack, you wouldn't like
            Jack to smack you in the head and not react to your pose of the
            tossing fish. So be kind and allow others the same courtesy.</li>
          <li>Realize that just because a person role-plays being a jerk or
            stuck up (like a High Elf might), doesn't mean anything other than
            THAT IS HOW THEIR CHARACTER IS. In real life it's a totally
            different person. Realize this going in and coming out every day.
            You're dealing with characters run by people, if something a
            character is to much to deal with, try oocly speaking with the
            player and see what can be worked out. You can't always get out of
            what you've done to alter things but if advances or personal issues
            cloud actions, then we need to talk things out and openly.</li>
          <li>When a loot is set up, we may set up the /random rolling for the
            loot but loot always goes to the person who can use it on the
            scene/group. If Jack and Mel both can use the shaman item, then only
            they will roll and the rest of us can role-play whining all we like
            and they can roll, winner can role-play snatching it or whatever
            they like to claim it, try to stay ic unless the ooc message system
            is being used.</li>
          <li>If you're role-playing and others around you get rude and say to
            take to tells, ignore them. They're all talking ooc and spamming
            casino's and we don't complain, let them. We are Claws N Paws and we
            have standards and we have fun.&nbsp;</li>
          <li>If you're role-playing of a ... sexy nature between 2 people,
            please keep those out of reach of others. We don't want to know how
            you stick your tongue down xx's throat. We don't care if you do it,
            whatever floats your boat, but the rest of the world doesn't have to
            know. Kissing and hugging and snuggling and innocent poses are fine,
            it's the intimate ones that we don't wish shared with others. Keep
            that private! :)</li>
          <li>Address your emotes. Say 4 people in a group. John, Sally, Bob and
            Moe. Saying 'John tickles you like mad' makes Sally, Bob and Moe
            wonder who you're tickling! 'John tries to tickle Sally without
            mercy! His fingers working feverishly to try to get through that
            thick leather armor of hers to get to her skin!' That emote helps
            everyone understand WHO is doing WHAT to WHOM.&nbsp;</li>
          <li>More to come!</li>
