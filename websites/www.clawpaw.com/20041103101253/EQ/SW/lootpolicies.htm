<h2 align="center"><strong><font size="3">SW Loot Guidelines:</font></strong></h2>
<p><strong>For pickup groups</strong> (i.e. groups with strangers):&nbsp; State
your loot policy at the start, and be consistent in it's application, so there
can be no question of playing favorites.&nbsp; If someone doesn't like the
policy, they can choose to leave before you begin.&nbsp; Under no circumstances
should you change the policy midstream.&nbsp; In the event of a death or LD, you
should wait as long as possible before looting a no-drop item, to ensure
everyone has a chance at receiving it.</p>
<p><strong>For guild / alliance groups &amp; events:</strong></p>
<p>1) The character you bring to the event will get preferential treatment for
purposes of allocating loot.&nbsp; If you want to bring one character, but are
asked to bring a required alt, you may request to have the class of the
character you wanted to bring be what's considered first for loot.&nbsp; You
must arrange for this before the start of the event with the raid or loot
coordinator.&nbsp; If you do not make prior arrangements, we will assume that
the class of the character you bring will count as your 'main' for this event.</p>
<p>2) Alliance Raids will follow alliance loot rules, even if there are guests
attending the raid.</p>
<p>3) For not critical drops (i.e. non epic drops):</p>
<p>- Loot will be&nbsp;distributed first to the classes who attended the raid
that can use the item.&nbsp; If all of the classes that attend the raid who can
use the item pass, then the item will be distributed to an alt of a person who
attends the raid.&nbsp; If everyone passes on the item, then the item will
either be sold to cover raid costs or put in the coffers of the guild which
called the raid.</p>
<p>- All loot (other than no drop loot) will be distributed at the end of the
raid to avoid slowing things down.&nbsp; If you wish an item, but have to leave
the raid early, please send a tell to the raid coordinator to consider you for
the drop.</p>
<p>- You may only get one drop per raid, until everyone in the raid has an item.&nbsp;
The exception to this is no drop items.&nbsp; If there is a no drop item, then
this item will be given to a class attending the raid that can use the item,
even if everyone of that class already has an item, or would have passed in
order to get another drop.&nbsp; This ensures that no items go to waste.&nbsp;
Being directed to loot an item for this exception will not count as your loot on
the raid.</p>
<p>- Trinkets / cash drops will be used to cover raid costs.&nbsp; If you use
reagents on the raid, you should ask for your costs to be covered by these
drops.&nbsp; Most common examples of this are periods for Virtue (Cleric) and
Coffins for corpse retrieval (necro), but may include other classes.&nbsp;
Additional cash drops over above what's needed to run the raid will go to the
guild coffers of the guild calling the raid.&nbsp; Gems and other tradeskill
drops will go to the guild coffers for use by tradeskillers if applicable.&nbsp;
If you attend a raid and wish an item made from a drop, you may request this
after the raid.&nbsp; You will only be required to cover the other costs needed
to make the item.</p>
<p>3) For Critical Drops (i.e. Epic Drops):</p>
<p>- When possible, determine who will loot first prior to starting the raid.&nbsp;
For epic drops, preferential treatment will be given to alliance members who
attend the raid and need the drop.&nbsp; In the event that a MQable item drops,
and none of the alliance members are along who need the item, this item will
first go to guests of the raid in attendance who need the item.&nbsp; If no one
of the correct class is in attendance, then someone will loot the item for MQ
for the guild coffers (generally an enchanter, to minimize faction issues with
multiquesting.)&nbsp; The final decision will be the raid leader's, but will
include input from the guild leaders in attendance on the raid.&nbsp; The
decision should be based on factors including, but not limited to:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - How far along on the epic each person is</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Whether this is the first epic this person has ever
gotten</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- What level the character is</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - How long this person has been working on their epic</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - How often does this person attend events to help others
achieve their epics</p>
<p>Epic drops will not be considered as an item counting against distribution of
non-epic loot.</p>
