        <blockquote>
            <p>Given some of the issues we&#146;ve seen from the
            public lately in regards to Monks, we&#146;ve worked
            with a few for the last 3 hours on an enhancement.
            Monks now receive a built in haste effect beginning
            in the high 20s. The haste effect increases with
            level, and stacks with haste-items and haste-spells.
            At 50th monks will find they do <em>substantially</em>
            more damage per minute. </p>
            <p>I suppose this is a bit of a blessing and a curse,
            since doing more damage (over 15%) will make the
            creature more likely to turn on you, but we think it
            will be well received. This should reaffirm Monks as
            the masters of melee damage. I was even able to solo
            an experience-giving creature at 50th without using
            the mend skill. </p>
            <p>Barring any problems on test, this should make the
            live servers at the next patch. Let us know what you
            think. </p>
            <p>-Gordon<br>
            </p>
            <p><strong>What the hell?! A </strong><em><strong>melee</strong></em><strong>
            class soloing a </strong><em><strong>blue</strong></em><strong>
            mob at 50 </strong><em><strong>without</strong></em><strong>
            using any type of healing?</strong></p>
            <p>Well I did have a few buffs and appropriate
            equipment on for the level. </p>
            <p>The Buffs were: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Strength of Stone </li>
                <li>Swift Like the Wind </li>
                <li>Resolution </li>
                <li>Symbol of Naltron </li>
            </ul>
            <p>So I suppose it wasn't a <em>pure</em> solo. I'm
            going to have to go back in, try it again without the
            buffs but use mend if need-be. Oh, the mob tested was
            a 37th level Hill Giant. </p>
            <p>- Gordon<br>
            </p>
            <p><strong>Abashi, have they also changed it to where
            a monks delay can go below 20? </strong></p>
            <p>Yeah, it can go much lower than that now. The cap
            at 20 was based on the max effect of any haste-items
            and haste-spells combined. The built-in monk haste is
            computed before that. Though I of course won't give
            you the exact numbers, it can go substantially lower
            than 20. </p>

        new PR guy at Verant, responded to some questions asked
        about mobs seeing through Feign Death even after a
        successful feign. Here's the question, with the response
        in italics:</strong></font></p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">One thing on the
            &quot;new&quot; FD, aside from the nerfing it
            represents to +35 monks. There are a lot of times
            when mobs under level 35 will see through a
            successful feign (i.e. one with no &quot;you have
            fallen to the ground&quot; message). We knew of
            situations when this would happen before...lag,
            caster mobs casting before feign and then the spell
            hitting after feign and breaking it, etc. But now, a
            lot of monks are feigning with no lag, on low level
            non-casters...no failure message, and the mob
            continues to beat on them. <br>
            I strongly suspect this is a bug, or at the very
            least unintentional. There has never been an
            indication, not even in your explanation, that mobs
            get anything like a &quot;save v. successful
            feign.&quot; This never happened before the first FD
            nerf patch. <br>
            <br>
            Abashi, is this a bug or a permanent part of the
            nerf? <br>
            <br>
            <em>It's not a bug. In addition to the skill check
            for person who is feigning, each creature who is
            aggro'd on him or passes by has a *small* chance to
            see through it. It's the equivalence to an
            intelligence check. Some just won't fall for it. <br>
            <br>
            The percentage changes haven't changed. <br>

            Naked monk: 36 <br>
            Monk+FBSS: 30 <br>
            Monk+Swirlspine: 30 <br>
            <br>
            I repeated these tests this weekend and got these
            numbers: <br>
            <br>
            Naked monk: 35.5 <br>
            Monk+FBSS: 29.0 <br>
            Monk+Swirlspine: 30.75 <br>
            Monk+Cloak of Flames: 26.4 <br>
            Monk+CoF+FBSS: 26.4 <br>
            Monk+CoF+SS: 26.4 <br>
            <br>
            Resulting hastes (rounded): <br>
            Swirlspine: 13% <br>
            FBSS: 18% <br>
            CoF: 25.5% <br>
            <br>
            So: <br>
            The last patch gave us a slight decrease in HTH
            delay. <br>
            The swirlspine belt was nerfed. <br>
            The CoF doesn't stack with either of those belts.</em></font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Ah,
        I've finally gotten the site up in a working condition.
        Here's a little information on the site itself:</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>The
        main goal of this site is to have a dedicated news and
        information resource for monks. There are plenty of good
        monk information sites out there, most notably the
        EverQuest Monks forums, and eqstomped's monk page.
        However, there wasn't a good regularly updated site which
        I felt was sorely lacking, so I decided to put this site
        up. I will not add forums or an equipment section, since
        they already exist, instead I will just link to them.
        Most of the information I will post or have up is from
        the EQ Monks forum, the EQMonks onelist mailing list, and
        lots of other class specific sites. Plus my own personal
        experience.</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Another
        goal was to have the site be fast loading and easy to
        access, so I decided not to use any graphics on the page.
        Hopefully not too many people will be turned away by the
        lack of pizzaz, but heck, I'm just a programmer, I can't
        make spiffy graphics. The site is seperated into 6 major
        sections. This, the main page, is the news and update
        page, and everything new will be listed here. The forums
        link will take you to Korzon's monk forum, the best forum
        for monks. The equipment will take you to the Stomped
        equipment page. Information will contain quest
        information, essays, and studies on the monk class.
        Currently, I've put up links to alot of the important
        quests for monks. The Guides page will contain zone
        guides for everquest in general. These are mostly written
        by me, but I'll put up any user submitted ones as well.
        Currently, I have an upper guk and lower guk guide. The
        spawns for the Idealist, Realist, Herbalist and Tactician
        are wrong, so if anyone has time, please mail me with the
        correct spawn locations. Finally, the links page will
        contain links to my favorite EQ pages.</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>The
        name of the Site, &quot;Relentless Monk&quot;, comes from
        my guild's name (Relentless on Cazic Thule). Plus I
        thought it sounded cool, and I couldn't think of anything
        better. My name is Sandeep Shekar, I'm a programmer at
        Volition, Inc. I play a (currently) 41 monk on Cazic
        Thule named Jekhar Shadowfist, as well as various other
        characters, including a 48 Wizard. My goals are to keep
        this site regularly updated (at least once in two days),
        and to include all newsworthy information for monks. I'll
        probably be updating it mostly in the afternoons, before
        I log onto everquest. </b></font></p>
