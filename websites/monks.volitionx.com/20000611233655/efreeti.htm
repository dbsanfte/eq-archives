Lord</em>|Relentless&gt;</font></h1>

<h3><font size="3" face="Arial"><u>Overview</u></font></h3>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Efreeti Lord run is one of the
most challenging and fun runs for a 40+ group ready to test their
mettle at a real adventure. It is almost always an extremely
exciting run, and because of the way it is set up, there is added
time pressure, forcing you to keep your downtime low and the pace
up. Doing the efreeti lord is basically a two step process -
Doing the run to get to the lord, and then camping the lord
itself. Camping the lord is extremely boring, and is the main
reason I don't like the run. The actual lord camp can be easily
held with 6 people. The run itself is the fun part, and while it
can be done with 6 people, I personally recommend having 12
people to keep things safe. If you choose to do the efreeti run
the heavy handed way (Charging the groups of imps one at a time),
you'll need a stronger party, but won't be nearly as pressed for
time. This guide will be for doing the run with a feign death
puller and killing one or two imps at a time.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The loot from the Efreeti Run
mostly consists of the loot from the Efreeti Lord himself,
although you might kill the Death Beetle and Guano Harvester in
the early parts of the run. While the run is exciting, when you
finally get to the Efreeti Room at the ending, be prepared for a
big let down. His lair is just a boring, simple cave, and he's
pretty easy to kill, making the climax anything but exciting.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The entire run take take about
30-48 minutes, usually broken into two segments, 24 minutes each.
The Efreeti Lord spawns about 25-30% of the time, and his common
drop is arguably better than his rare drop, so camping the lord
is quite profitable from a loot standpoint. The spawn time on the
lord is 24 minutes, and unless you are pulling for xp, you will
only be killing 2 or 3 monsters every 24 minutes, so the camp is
a very boring one.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The key to a successful Efreeti
Run is timing. Someone in the group, probably the puller, <strong>must</strong>
time the 24 minute spawn on the imps. Start timing from the first
imp killed, and keep the timer running. If you miss your window
of oppurtunity and let something respawn before your group has
moved into position, you <strong>will</strong> get screwed over
by backspawn and will end up fighting much more than you need to.
Early on you'll feel that you have more than enough time and will
probably get lax. Don't. Keep moving from the minute the first
imp is killed, up until you reach the efreeti lord. Don't let
your casters get to full mana. Make sure they know they will be
fighting almost continuously, and should use mana sparingly. If a
group's cleric is out of mana, have tanks in that group know to
back off from the monster if they are getting hit. Casters should
med every second that they aren't casting.</font></p>

<h3><font size="3" face="Arial"><u>Monsters</u></font></h3>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">There are two types of monsters
you will be dealing with on the Efreeti Run, as well as some of
the bats and bugs from the regular areas (Mostly Lava Beetles).
Imp Protectors are more common, and there are also Lava
Guardians.</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Imp Protectors</strong>
        - Range from level 44-48, hit for about 110, have quite a
        few hit points, and are one of the hardest
        &quot;experience monsters&quot; in the game. They have a
        fire-based proc, and a massive aggro radius.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Lava Guardians</strong>
        - Range from level 44-46, hit for about 100. They are
        summoned creatures, and look like fire elementals. Have
        druids and magicians use anti-summoned spells against
        these. They also have a massive aggro radius. The more of
        these that are on the run, the easier that the run will
        be.</font></li>
</ul>

<h3><font size="3" face="Arial"><u>Chain Pulling</u></font></h3>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><em>This second is copied from the
Fire Giant guide I have, and is only here for reference.</em></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The easiest and safest way to
single pull Imps is to use chain pulling. If your puller hasn't
had any practice with this method of pulling, it's suggested that
you practice it in Lower Guk at the King and Lord camps. For
those that don't know how to do this, here's a brief description:</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">There are at least two people
involved in the pulling. The first, or primary puller, is a monk
or shadowknight. The second, or chain puller, can be any tank
class, although a monk or shadowknight is safest in case of an
error. Any class with a good range attack can serve this role as
well. He should be in the same group as the puller, should have
his hitpoints buffed as well, and everyone should be set to
assist the chain puller.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">When all groups are ready for a
pull, the primary puller goes out to the monsters, and aggros a
group of them. He runs back towards the group, and when he's
outside the aggro range of all of the monsters that are being
pulled, he feigns death. At this point, the monsters that were
pulled will hang around the feigned puller's body for awhile, and
then start to go home. Hopefully, one of the group will linger
around for longer than the others. When there is just one left,
and the others have had enough time to get a good distane away
from the lingerer, the chain puller comes up and smacks the last
one, and runs it back to the group. If done properly, the others
will be outside of aggro range and will not assist the single
lingerer.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The primary puller stays on the
ground till the fight has started, and then he can either lie
there, or check to see if his aggro is clear. Only if he is
certain that nothing is still aggro to him should he return to
the group and help them out.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">There are several variations to
this, including multiple chainings and special casing wanderers
and statics. These intracacies are not necessary, although it is
suggested that your puller learn them in time. For Imps, you
don't need to use any special tricks. Just make sure the puller
knows when he has a wanderer on him, and not to return to the
group unless he's sure that wanderer is no longer aggro.</font></p>

<h3><font size="3" face="Arial"><u>Chain Pulling Doubles</u></font></h3>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Chain pulling doubles is very much
like chain pulling singles. You use it when you know that your
group can take two monsters at a time, and are pressed for time.
Rather than trying to isolate a single, and sometimes attempting
to chain twice or three times, you can just have your chain
puller come in when there are still two monsters in aggro range.
Both monsters will aggro to the chainer, and your group can
handle them both. All other conditions for chain pulling apply.</font></p>

</ul>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Beetle Room</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The first thing your group needs
to do is clear the Death Beetle room. This is the room marked <strong>C1</strong>
on the map. There are about 5 beetles that you need to kill
total, including the one down the pathway. You can approach this
room from either <strong>N1</strong> or <strong>N2</strong>. We
always come through N2, mostly because there's the rare chance
that we might see the Guano Harvester. Hehe. Either way, you'll
have to deal with a few bats. Should be no trouble if your group
is ready to handle the Efreeti. Clear this room quickly, and have
a secondary timer on the respawn of this room. It's not too
important, as you are usually out of here before the respawn, but
always good to be safe. Have everyone buff up and med to full. If
your buffs drop in the middle of this run, you probably won't
have a chance to rebuff (except the cheaper buffs). Once everyone
is buffed, get ready for the pulls.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Imp Group 1</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The party should all be at C1, and
your puller should go across the lava, across the lily pads, and
aggro one of the imps in <strong>I1</strong>. The puller can
either have Dead Man Floating, Levitate, or just run quickly
across. I prefer to just run across, since I like jumping alot
when I pull, and you can't jump while levitating. The puller
should feign at stop F1, and see how many imps/guardians are on
him. If there are only two, you have the two statics, and can
either chain pull them or kill them both off. If there are three,
at least one is a wanderer, and if you got lucky, there are all
four. It's best to kill the wanderers at the start of the cycle,
so if you do have wanderers, let all the imps go home, then stand
up. If things went well, the static imps should stay at I2, and
any of the wanderers you had on you should come charging back.
Take the wanderer(s) back to the group and kill them. The minute
the first imp dies, start your timer.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">It is almost always best to kill
the wanderers first, but if you got the statics first, then you
can have your puller wait at <strong>I1</strong> until the
wanderers come around, and pull them back to the group. This can
take valuable time, and if you choose to, you can kill the
wanderers whenever they show up. I'll assume they are killed at
this point. Once all of <strong>I1</strong> is dead as well as
the wanderers, you might want to move the group up to <strong>C2</strong>.
I usually choose to keep them at <strong>C1</strong>. Imps don't
hit <strong>too</strong> hard, and pulling a longer distance for
the sake of safety seems like a fair trade.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Imp Group 2</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">If things went well, you should
have about 16-18 minutes left on your clock now. If you have
more, you are doing well. If you have less, you need to hurry,
and you'll definitely want to do the next set as fast as
possible. Your group should be set up at <strong>C1 </strong>or<strong>
C2</strong>, so that they are out of line of sight from the
alcove across the lily pads. Your puller needs to go up the ramp,
aggro the 3 or 4 imps at <strong>I2</strong>, and then run back
down the ramp and feign at <strong>F2. </strong>If the puller
wants, he can feign at <strong>F1</strong> as well. I say 3 or 4,
because while I usually see four imps up there, I think one of
them is always one of the wanderers, and there are actually only
3 statics here. I always lose count, which is bad for a puller,
but I'm sorry :). Either way, you can chain pull these easily,
especially if your chain puller has a bow and can shoot the imps
from across the lava river. After dispatching of these imps, it's
time to move the group up to <strong>C3</strong>. By this point,
all the wanderers need to be killed, and if there is just one
left, have everyone kill it up at <strong>C3</strong>. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>The Loop</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">When your party moves up to <strong>C3</strong>,
make sure they do it properly. I usually ask for everyone to be
levitating, cause someone invariably falls in the lava. If you do
fall in the lava, it's not a big deal, it's easy to get out. Have
everyone hug the <strong>right</strong> wall going up the ramp,
and make sure the group stays near the <strong>right</strong>
wall once they get up to <strong>C3</strong>. You can see <strong>I4</strong>
from this point, but they shouldn't aggro unless someone is
fighting too far away from the walls. By now you should either
have about 5-10 minutes left. If you have more than that, you are
doing very well, and should be fine to continue moving forward.
If you have that, or less than that, have your party rest up at <strong>C3</strong>
and wait for the wanderers to respawn and kill them. Only wait
for the wanderers if you killed them in the first set of
monsters. If <strong>I2</strong> respawns before your group has
moved, you will be in quite a bit of trouble. If you get really
close to <strong>I2</strong> respawning, and don't want to abort
your run, have the group move to <strong>F3</strong>. <strong>F3 </strong>is
generally a safe area. You won't be able to seperate the next
group, but if you watch the wanderer carefully, you can charge
the last group at <strong>I3</strong>, and only fight 2 at a
time.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">I'll assume you did this
correctly, and don't need to charge the last group. Your group
should be at <strong>C3</strong>. The wanderers respawn should be
dead. Nothing should spawn on top of you for at least 5-8
minutes. The puller should aggro group <strong>I3</strong>, and
feign at <strong>F3</strong>. If there are three monsters on him,
one is a wanderer, and you can let them all go home, and then
stand up to pull just the wanderer. If there are just two, you
can pull them both to the group, or chain pull singles. After
killing all of <strong>I3 </strong>except one, or after killing
just one, leaving two, have your group move to <strong>F3</strong>,
get ready, and charge whatever is left at <strong>I3</strong>.
After killing <strong>I3</strong>, the hard part of the run is
pretty much done, and you can relax quite a bit more. The party
should all be at <strong>C4</strong>.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Final Approach</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Have your puller go into the
Efreeti area (<strong>C5</strong>), and aggro the room itself.
Feign at <strong>F4</strong> and chain pull a single. It's nice
seperating the room a bit, which is why I choose to single pull
these rather than charging the room. Once one of them is dead,
have your group wait a short time, and then charge the last one
in the efreeti room. You have now succesfully finished the
Efreeti Run. Usually at this point, everyone leaves except six
people, who gate out. Sometimes everyone will stay, but it's a
boring camp, and people will leave. You can pull imps for
experience, and they are very good experience. Just make sure you
don't pull any big groups, and don't pull right before the room
respawn. It's usually a good idea to keep <strong>I3</strong>
killed, in case of runners, and I usually don't touch <strong>I4</strong>,
for reasons given in the notes. Enjoy your </font><a

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Notes</strong></font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>N1 - </strong>Entering
        the Beetle Room through this path, you will encounter 6-7
        bats from the crusher to here. It's got a little lava
        along the way, which is why I usually prefer not to take
        my party through it.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>N2 - </strong>This
        path will go past Nox's wandering path, as well as the
        Guano Harvester's path. There's a wandering bat that
        comes near here as well, which you might want to keep
        dead while you are in the room. (This bat is the
        placeholder for the Guano Harvester).</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>N3 - </strong>This
        mario-esque jumping path of rocks across the lava river
        is called the &quot;lily pads&quot;. You can run right
        across them with no trouble if you aim yourself right, or
        you can levitate across. Even if you are really clumsy,
        you shouldn't take more than 80-100 points of damage
        crossing the river.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>N4 - </strong>I've
        never attacked this group of imps. Even when I've gotten
        the entire loop cleared, I don't aggro these guys. The
        main reason for this is that even if you aggro them from
        the clockwise side, they will always pathfind
        counterclockwise, taking them past any of the imps at <strong>I3</strong>.
        Not worth the hassle in my opinion. I've never fallen in
        this pit either, and I'm not sure how to get out of the
        lava, but I'm sure there is a way. I'm not sure why you'd
        ever want to head through <strong>I4</strong> to get to
        the Efreeti room, since it has more spawns to contend
        with.</font></li>
