Guide</em>| Monk&gt;</font><font size="3" face="Garamond"><u></u></font></h1>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>WARNING: This guide is
meant for Monks who want to brew Heady Kiolas consistently as an
ingredient for tailoring Cured Silk or Wu's Gauntlets. This
contains a fair bit of spoiler information. It will take you to
Brewing Skill 68, at which time you will be successful at brewing
Heady Kiolas 90% of the time. Some information for going past 68
is also included.</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Since I have a real life weakness
for B&amp;B (Benedictine &amp; Brandy, angel nectar brewed by the
Benedictine monks), Sindi the monk thought she should pursue the
time-honoured monk tradition of Brewing. Most of this I've
discovered through trial and error with several characters as
well as perusing ALL the websites I could find. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong><u>Brewing Locations</u></strong>:</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Freeport</strong>:
        West Freeport, brew barrel outside of Hog Caller's Inn.
        East Freeport inside Traveler's Holiday</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Qeynos</strong>:
        South Qeynos in the Fish's Ale and in the Lion's Mane</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Rivervale</strong>:
        Along the wall behind the Fool's Gold, on the way to the
        Druid Guild (Tagglefoot Farm) from the bank</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Highpass Hold</strong>:
        Tiger's Roar Inn (you can fish out the window too).</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>HighKeep</strong>:
        2nd floor</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong><u>Ingredient Locations:</u></strong></font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Snake skins</strong>:
        West Freeport is great. North Qeynos, East Freeport, and
        Misty Thicket are acceptable locations.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Fish</strong>:
        Fishing poles and bait can usually be bought from a
        vendor near every body of water. Fish is sold at the Port
        Authority in East Freeport, the building by the Qeynos
        boat dock, Fiddy Bobick in the building by Rivervale
        dock, Tiger's Roar Inn in Highpass Hold.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Grapes and Bottles</strong>:
        Available in most Inns that sell alcohol</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Water</strong>: Lots
        of places, but I'll make some special notes. You MUST use
        store bought water. Foraged or summoned water will not
        work. If you are making Fish Wine in East Freeport, buy
        water from the building just before the gates out to the
        E FP desert. Voleen's Bakery in South Qeynos has water.
        Daleen Leafsway by the Druid Guild (Tagglefoot farm) and
        Fiddy Bobick at the docks in Rivervale are both
        convenient to the brew barrel.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Ale and Short Beer</strong>:
        Kristy Charcoal stands in the main path near the Militia
        House from West Freeport to North Freeport. Voleen's
        Bakery in South Qeynos has a female vendor. Golden
        Rooster in Highpass Hold. The gaming room in HighKeep 2nd
        floor has several vendors. Ale ingredients are not sold
        in Rivervale.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong><u>General
Recommendations:</u></strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Training</strong>: Put 1
point into Brewing if you want to, but it is not necessary. Monks
have precious few training points to waste.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Item Selection</strong>:
Use &lt;CTRL&gt; &lt;Left Click&gt; to select 1 from a pile of 20
or less stacked items. You don't have to slide that frightful
slider.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Intelligence and Wisdom</strong>:
As with any skill you want to raise quickly, put on any Int and
Wis items/jewellry that you have. It makes a big difference.
Don't drink and brew, it lowers your Int.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Charisma</strong>: Wear
any Charisma items you have while buying ingredients and selling
drinks back (this includes sashes and headbands). It can
substantially cut your costs.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Ale step</strong>: Don't
skip the Ale step to get from skill 62 to 68. It only takes a few
minutes, and makes a significant difference in your Heady Kiola
failure rate.</font></p>

Ingredient locations</strong>: Print out complete list from </font><a
href="http://www.eqtraders.com"><font size="2" face="Arial">www.eqtraders.com</font></a></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Going past Skill 68</strong>:
I've added some notes at the end of this guide. Monks are at a
disadvantage because we don't have Foraging skill, so the most
important recommendation is to make friends with Foragers who
will collect Vegetables, Fishing Grubs, Fruit, and Morning Dew
for you (Morning Dew is for Elven wine, it can be foraged in
zones with vegetation early in the morning).</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong><u>Method 1: Time
consuming, VERY low cost</u></strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Sindi started brewing at level 3,
so I did not have the cash to spend on a trade skill like some
other people do. This information also assumes that you sell back
all your brews to the vendor, and don't indulge in a little
drinking.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Bog Juice: Skill 1-21</strong></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">1 snake skin, 1 water, 1
    bottle</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Go out and kill several
    hundred snakes to get their skins (takes about 200 skins at
    newbie levels of Intelligence). Save eggs for personal food
    or sell to a baker (they need them for dough). Save any extra
    snake skins in the bank (more on this later), OR, keep
    brewing with the snake skins to make the money that must be
    initially invested into Fish Wine.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Cost: Close to break even
    (loss at first), net loss a few gold pieces.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Fish Wine: Skill 22-62</strong></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">1 fish, 1 water, 1 grapes, 1
    bottle</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Grab a fishing pole and fish
    for hours (takes about 500 fish at newbie Intelligence).
    Recoup money spent on fishing poles and bait with the daggers
    and sandals, sell fish scales to casters. Try not to get
    discouraged, as you will only succeed 25-30% of your attempts
    at first. You will need approximately 7-8pp to get to 45
    skill, but after that you will recover most of that.
    Recommendation: Spend some of your newbie life (levels 1-3)
    fishing (even after you reach your level's skill cap), and
    sock away the fish in the bank until you have some money to
    invest in this stage.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Cost: Your average
    cost/attempt is about 25cp at 21 skill to start, so you will
    lose money at first but start making a profit around 45
    skill, overall net loss a few plat (2-4). </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Notes for skill 21-62:</font></p>
    <ul>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial">DO NOT make Short Beer
            like everyone says, it is a money pit.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial">DO NOT make Mead (trivial
            at mid forties), you lose money on it even when it is
            trivial.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial">DO NOT make Heady Kiola,
            even though it trivials at 46. At 5gp per attempt it
            is a money pit, be patient and get to skill 68.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial">DO NOT make Short Ale
            (trivial at 51), also a money pit.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Although Ale SEEMS to be
            profitable because it produces 3 (like Fish Wine), if
            you run the numbers it turns out that Fish Wine is
            less costly.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial">At 50 skill Bog Juice is
            about 95% success rate, so if you saved those extra
            snake skins then you can now indulge in some drinking
            at low cost.</font></li>
    </ul>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Ale: Skill 62-68</strong></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The first brew without any
    harvested items, but at 62 skill you succeed about 70% of the
    time, thus recouping your costs overall.<br>
    Cost: break even</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">TOTAL COST: Under 5pp.
    Break-even or a small profit is possible with lots of Int,
    Wis, and Charisma items.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong><u></u></strong></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong><u>Method 2: Less time
consuming, fairly costly</u></strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">I still suggest not putting points
into Brewing, because our points are precious. Sure, it will take
you an extra 10 minutes, 100 mouse clicks, and 1gp, but you won't
Flying Kick yourself when your Defense Skill is stuck at 229 for
a month.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Skill 1-21</strong></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Bog Juice or Short Beer. You
    can auction for snake skins at 20 for 1pp, most newbies are
    quite willing to supply you with them since they fetch a
    lousy price at the vendors. Check the newbie vendors and buy
    up all the snake skins first. They are also sold in the
    Wizard's and Enchanter's Guilds in Erudin. (Short Beer if you
    plan on going to the Vodka stage, bank it and see below.
    Short Beer needs 1 Hops, 1 Barley, 1 Malt, 1 Cask).</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Skill 21-31</strong> </font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Short Beer or Fish Wine. Buy
    the fish instead of Fishing. (Short beer for Vodka)</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Skill 31-62</strong></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Fish Wine. This is by far the
    most economical drink to make even with bought fish, versus
    your other choices of Mead, Gypsy Wine, Short Ale and Ale.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Skill 62-68</strong></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Ale.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>TOTAL COST</strong>: I
haven't figured this out exactly, but it's somewhere in the
20-30pp range, and about 40-50pp if you make Short Beer.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong><u></u></strong></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong><u>Heady Kioals</u></strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Now you can make them with
confidence. Kiola Sap is sold at almost all Inns on the alcohol
vendors. The same vendors sell bottles. 2 Kiola Sap (unstacked),
1 water, 1 bottle in the brew barrel and Presto! Heady Kiola.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong><u></u></strong></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong><u>Good locations for
Tailoring &amp; Brewing simultaneously:</u></strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">If you want to tailor your own
cured silk, I recommend building yourself a Spider Suit of items
with Save vs. Poison. Not many people want to go spider hunting
for experience, so you will be soloing a lot. If you see a high
level (45+) Necromancer, ask them to cast Dead Man Floating on
you, it puts a ton of points in your save vs. poison column.
Don't forget your bandaids.</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>West Freeport / East
        Commons area-</strong> spiders, wolves, lions, bears in E
        Commons; snakes and brew barrel in W FP, but you have to
        buy patterns in E FP.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>East Freeport /
        Northern Ro area</strong> - spiders, pumas, secondary
        patterns (bracers etc.) and large sewing kit in N Ro;
        snakes, brew barrel, fish and fishing, primary patterns
        (tunics etc.) in E FP.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Qeynos area</strong>
        - snakes, wolves and bears in N Qeynos and Qeynos Hills;
        spiders, lions, bears, secondary patterns and large
        sewing kit in West Karana; primary patterns, brew barrels
        and supplies, fish and fishing in S Qeynos.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Highpass / East
        Karana area</strong> - <em>(NOT recommended for under
        level 17</em>, <em>when you get Feign Death</em>)
        Carrions, Crags, lions in E Karana; brew barrels,
        supplies, fish and fishing, secondary patterns (Serpent's
        Supply) in Highpass and Highkeep.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Rivervale / Misty
        Thicket area</strong> - snakes, wolves, bears, spiders,
        large sewing kit and secondary patterns in Misty; brew
        barrel, grapes, bottles, fish and fishing in Rivervale
        (NO hops etc. here).</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong><u></u></strong></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong><u>Continuing your Brewing
career above 68 skill:</u></strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Make friends with Foragers. Ask
them to save their vegetables and fishing grubs for you, you are
going to need ALOT of them, first of all the vegetables to get
you through the vodka stage, and then you'll need even more vodka
(and the fishing grubs) for Hulgarsh and Bleeding Brains later.
Pick up all those fishing grubs that are left on the ground and
bank them.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Start with Gnomish Spirits (rat
ear, spider leg, rice, bottle). Trivial at 95. Kill rats and
spiders or buy rat ears and spider legs (save spider legs from
the spiders you hunt for silk). Don't bother with the Tumpy Tonic
stage (trivial at 86), for 2 reasons - it is Horribly expensive,
and Horribly awkward. Kiola Nuts are only available on Sister's
Isle in Ocean of Tears, and they are unstackable. It requires
several trips through OOT to buy as many as you need. Each nut is
almost 2gp. I bought 100 nuts, got 9 skill points, wasted 20pp
and a lot of time. I would only suggest it if you are extremely
bored, have money, and wish to endlessly practice scaring the
boat with Instill Doubt.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Now you need the vegetables. Make
Vodka (Foraged Vegetables, Water, 2 Short Beer unstacked,
bottle), Vodka, and more Vodka (trivials at 123). Bank it all.
After all, you want to make neat drinks with it later, right?</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Fierce Brew to 135, Hulgarsh,
Ginesh, and Bleeding Brains after that. Impress your friends and
make their world sway.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Cheers!</strong></font></p>
