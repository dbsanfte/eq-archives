  	<TD CLASS="characterdescription">  Keseh never belived the TeirDal feelings...<BR> They were strange, as something was missing, either a contradiction, or something unresolved.<BR> The dark elf lived for 8 years, being opposed to worship Innoruuk in any way, making his familys life miserable in the eye of the Teirdal community.<BR> Therefore, as a punishment for his behavior, Keseh was locked in a cell, with wood elves, humans and many others that opposed the hatefull Dark elves.<BR> But hate No.. he was understanding something as they dragged him into his cell... as he spent many days hungry, facing four cracked walls, in company of people who could barely speak.<BR> No.. they dont hate. Now I understand, this feeling they say is for the strong ones  is no more than fear. They fear me, they dont understand me.. they can not tolerate my presence. Thus, I must be out of sigh. They did this to their own son, who they claimed to take care. That is fear...<BR> As he realized that, Keseh changed. He started to claim himself a follower of Innoruuk, in order to escape his prisom. After one year, he was able to walk freely on Neriak, but couldnt leave their city. Three years later, they began to trust him, to finally give him a mission outside the doomed place.<BR> He was supposed to gather wolf pelts for armor at nektulos. He ran, having no idea of where to go, he just ran foward, avoiding the many creatures he encountered on the way.<BR> He found some place, beautiful for someone who never left nektulos for once. It was called the commonlands. The light there charmed him.. something even greater than his freedom.. only to contemplate it.<BR> But the enchanter wasnt safe yet, he was still close to his family. He spoted some ruins, with humans arround it and began to run towards it. <BR> At the same time, a couple of elder wood elves were walking.. smiling and looking at each other, while an orc watched them at distance.<BR> Keseh was getting closer to the druid ring, and suddenly a sound was heard, as if a stone crushed a tree. He turned back, and saw a green creature, with an hammer breaking the elder wood elf leg, as the other was trying to fight back.<BR> Quickly, the enchanter began to cast a spell he had learned, and the deathfist orc began to choke.<BR> The dark elf stood there, watching the druid Hess, and the warrior Leoria, bleeding on the floor. They couldnt resist, as age took their health away.<BR> The couple thanked him, amazed that a dark elf would help. Keseh said he helped because he was not like his brothers, and was escaping from his family.<BR> The druid spit blood, and said  if you could do a last favor for us, we would be glad to call you a part of our family. Find Revler, at Faydwer.. tt.. take the boat at Freeport, tell him what happenned and that not to worry, as we had a wonderfull existence.<BR> The couple looked at each other, smiled and died.<BR> Keseh managed to get to faydwer, being helped for many people on the way... it were hard times there, as he wasnt trusted yet by anyone, but yet he was happier than ever...<BR> When he found revler, his now brother noticed something on the enchanters left eye.. a crystaline dragon mark.<BR> <BR>  .<BR> Thank you Wengfu for binding me,  anydaria for making me invisible to catch the boat and Vermillon, for buying spells for me when I came with nothing from Neriak...</TD>
