I'm sure we've all done it once or twice (or more). You start looking through your bags to see where that item that you've been carrying around for a month is hiding so that you can finally sell it. But instead of closing your tailoring kit, you combine it. Suddenly you've lost some stuff that you really wanted to keep.
<P>
Well, since EverQuest opened we've been warning you that this was one of the risks that you took when using lightweight trade containers for their carrying capacity rather than just using them for making things.
<P>
We've decided to make a rather dramatic change for the better when it comes to trade containers.
<P>
With this upcoming patch, trade containers will no longer combine items that are not a valid and complete recipe.
<P>
This means that if you accidentally hit combine, the container will not destroy your items. This also means that if you make an error and put the wrong item in the container while trying to cook something up, it won't destroy those items either. This will be a huge boon to craftspeople all across Norrath.
<P>
But this removes the only drawback to using trade containers as backpacks. Their reduced weight and often larger carrying capacity made them more desirable as bags, with the risk that you might just lose something if you made a mistake.
<P>
So, with the logical change in the way combinable containers work (I mean, really, how often does a sewing kit eat a halberd?), we are also going to make them less desirable for just carrying stuff around in. We will be increasing their weight rather significantly. Where many of these containers weighed under 1 pound, they will now weigh as much as 4 pounds for the largest sewing kit.
<P>
Along with this we are making a change to tailor made backpacks. In case you didn't know (and I sure didn't), most tailor made packs have a built in weight reduction of 5%. We are raising that to 10%. We will also be displaying the weight reduction of all containers with the information shown on a right click. It seems that so few people knew about the weight reduction of tailor made items, even at Verant, that it seems that this bit of information should be shown to the players.
