<TR>
	<TD CLASS="characterdescription">WHO WE ARE <P>We strive to be just what the guild was meant to be in the beginning, a House of Friends. We are a tight knit family guild that came together with the dissolving of Elders Elite and another small guild not named. Our main goal in the game is to enjoy each others company, and to have fun while doing so.<P>CONDUCT AND DISCIPLINE<BR>Rule number one is to play nice with the other kids in the sandbox. We treat each other with respect, and if we have a disagreement with another member, it is to be handled in a mature, nonaggressive fashion. We do not flame one another on these, or any other boards, nor in game. We hold ourselves to the highest standards.<BR>Should a member begin causing rifts on the boards, treating other members with intentional malice, giving BOTD a bad rep to other guilds by such methods as Ksing, training, badmouthing other guilds or harassing others, only one chance is given for such poor behavior. If a second complaint comes our way, it will be asked that you leave to find a guild better suited to your personality. We would like to keep BOTD as stress free and friendly as possible. Remember that you are responsible for your own behavior and should not have to be babysat. We are all adults and expect that from each and every member. <P>LEADERSHIP<BR>The primary leadership of Blood Of The Dragon is comprised of the cofounders: Runical/Runelle title: Guild Leader, designated Adjutant Guild Leader Dalvarion/Iniquity and of the Original 10 Founders Dreamella , Fenlaorrex , Shadowstallker , Belorm , Gidon and additional Officers since the founders Sprinkler , Starxy They are assisted by a core group of advising council. The council is set up upon a rotating basis that will change at the first of every month. Membership upon the council is not mandatory, but it will be offered up to every member of BOTD at some point in time. Turning down a spot on the council one month will not affect future invites back onto the council should one change their mind. Nor will it be a problem should one decide not to serve more than once. The purpose of rotating the leadership duties is to keep a sense of equality throughout the guild; to allow everyone a chance to step up to the plate and give the guild what they have to offer. <P>The duties of the advising council are as follows: To help in the planning, organization and leading of the weekly guild events. They will be given official officer ship status, viewable by nonBOTD in game. They will be allowed to handle interguild conflicts if they arise if non of the Regular Officers are not present online, to the best of their ability. To help be 'the face' of the guild during their month of representation. In no way, however, is any member of the advising council at any time responsible for any form of discipline or reprimanding of any other member of BOTD. This ugly task, should it ever arise, will be handled by one of the Officers designated for this role to be named upon approval for now Runical/Runelle and Dalvarion/Iniquity have this nasty job. Council members will also aid and assist in the aping process when it is open, by helping to greet potential applicants on the boards and keeping them abreast of functions. Ninja invites into the guild are not allowed by council members and or any member of Officer status there are some exceptions to this rule we do allow RL friends and Family to join but it will be on a 30day basis to see how they work with the rest of the guild, and such an act could be cause for guild removal. However, should an applicant get the required all guild approval for admittance, and the invite is approved by the cofounders, a council member is allowed to do an invite in those cases. <P>APPLICATION AND GROWTH<BR>BOTD was originally set up with no rules in the set so at this time we are setting them to make it a Maximum of 50 members at a given time so that the closeness yet abilities to grow enough to raid are available to us all. At this point in time, there is a desire or plan for growth to bring us to full status quo at the time we are fill we will stop lvl out the guild and see if any future growth is needed. In order to keep the family atmosphere alive, we believe that size limit is crucial. Currently, our membership sets at around people. For the time being, we will not exceed 50. Being as that we are newly founded and still adjusting to the changes, the application process is open up until we meet our limit. Come the first part of March, the cofounders will look over the roster. If we still have less than 50 members by the time the final invites are made, we will look at requests from BOTD for friends that they would like to see join us. It would be preferred that potential apps know at least one current member of BOTD, for getting in otherwise may be exceedingly difficult. As it is, even knowing a member well does not garner an instant invite. We take pride in our membership and standards. We either already know or are striving to better know each and every member of the guild. We all get along with minimal problems. Therefore, it is important that anyone else brought on board be a most perfect fit. <P>During an open application period, potential members need to come to the boards and introduce themselves, who they know in the guild, why they want to join. It will be encouraged that they make efforts to get to know as many members as possible, preferably everyone. They will be allowed to attend guild functions, but only as a means of interacting with BOTD, not as a way to obtain loot. <P>After a substantial courting period (min of 30days) the applicants will be put to an all guild anonymous vote, via poll on the forums. It is imperative that every current BOTD member like and get along with the applicant. If the applicant has not put forth enough effort to get to know the membership come voting time, their application will be terminated and their ability to join on the raids relinquished. We want those that want us and can show dedication and effort. It is understood that even amongst friends diversity could cause quick judgment for an applicant. We trust our friends to act as a majority and will go with a 90% majority rule for applicants voting. Once the 50 cap is reached, the application process will close. The<BR>only way to get into BOTD at that point in time, is if a current member leaves the guild, opening up a spot. <P>RAIDING<BR>We are not a hardcore raiding guild and DO NOT mandate a member's playtime.  <P>We do however REQUIRE PLANES OF POWER Expansion, so that all may share the experiance and no one group will KS the Mobs. <P> Many of us are married, have children and real lives that always come first. In order to maintain unity, as well as for fun, we do have an all guild mandatory weekly event. We do understand that RL does invade and some people do work weekends but would like you to come if you can. <P>Designated Raid officers: there will be Main Raid officer and we will rotate an Asst. Raid officer bimonthly so that everyone has a chance to show there ability to lead and or pick a raid spot. Like the council if you are not interested in the position you may pass and another person will take the duty. <P>On every Friday Night, Saturday or Sunday (Maybe all Weekend), the designated Raid Officers will provide a guild activity. It is not expected that everyone attend, however if you are online that night at the time an event is in progress, it is expected that you be there (please note : this will also depend on the lvl of the raid since some zones require certain levels those online that are not of sufficient lvl will not be required to join) , supporting the guild and your friends instead of doing something on your own. Think of it more like your weekly brownie/boy scout troupe meeting. The weekly events can be anything, from raiding to friendly guild wars with a sister guild, to fun and games in the arena. The purpose is to have fun and come together to enjoy one another and reacquaint ourselves once a week. If members would like to do more raiding during the week on top of the weekly event, it is encouraged that they do so. Anyone can plan and lead their own event. The following guidelines will help to make everyone's life a little easier in this arena.<P>1) If the event entails going to the Luclin calendar for scheduling, please go to the current BOTD Raid Officer and allow them to make the post.<BR>2) Go to the boards and put in your raiding information, such as start time, location, who (if anyone) is assisting you in leading, and your own personal raid requirements. I.e.: do you need a solid start time, or can latecomers show up Will CoH or wiz/druid porting be available If you will allow latecomers, will there be a time limit set for that Will you allow friends of BOTD members or members of sister guilds to come or do you wish to keep it in house Are you setting aside a loot drop for yourself or someone else<BR>3) Be available for member questions before and during the raid, don't have it be pawned off on the leadership unless they are specifically asked to help and know your desires beforehand.<BR>4) Do not harass other members to come and join you on your raid, nor make them feel guilty if they don't wish to come.<BR>5) Have fun! <P>LOOT<BR>Loot can be the cause of much aggravation. We strive to keep it as conflict free and simple as possible by doing random rolls for all/all drops (CLASS SPECIFIC). We operate on a need before greed basis, based upon honesty. Anyone can roll on anything. It is preferred that you roll only if the item is an upgrade over your current piece, that you will use it for your main, that you won't twink with it or sell it. One can roll on whatever they like (CLASS SPECIFIC). However, once you have won a roll and receive a drop, multiples won't be given out until all people present have RECEIVED an item. If no ones main can use a drop, It will go to the GUILD VAULT for future use for upcoming BOTD Members.   <P>NO DROP ITEMS: <P>Will be awarded by the RL & Officers Attending the raid.  We Would request that you have a Magelo Account & keep it current so that we may see who NEEDS what Drops.<P>Applicants and friends attending the weekly events are only eligible for loot drops if the piece would rot, and if they would use it and not sell it. Items that they would take just for the money could be items that we can use to help fund our own events. We are young and broke! We do need to keep the bank alive as best as we can to ensure that we can continue hosting events for ourselves.  It is Not cheap to Host Raid.  The Average Hate raid Costs Upwards of 1000pp depending on how many stones we need to Teleport in, As well As cost for stacks of Peridot's is upwards of 200pp. <P>Bickering or whining about loot on the boards or to the leadership will not be tolerated. If you cannot be happy for someone over something that they have gotten, it is best to hold your tongue. If that is not possible, and loot is more important than friendship, this guild may not be the place for you. <P>GUILD BANK<BR>Currently, the guild bank is held on a mule of Runical/Runelle on a spare account that he has. It shall stay there until they deem it too much of a burden and they wish to let another help shoulder the responsibility.<P>The bank is used for three things. please note at this time I am unsure of what is actually on the bank but said items below can be donated by anyone.<BR>1) Reagents. This includes Peridot's for cleric spells, pearls for mages to CoH, coffins for CR and we may even eventually hold emeralds for Shaman buffs.<BR>2) Quest gems for Velious armor quests<BR>3) Money to buy more reagents.<BR>All coin and sellable loot will fund the bank on all guild raids. This enables us to continue having all guild raids. Peridot's and port stones will be distributed to clerics and wizards before the raids.<BR>Quest gems will be distributed on a first come first serve basis, and only when you are ready for the turn in. Please don't take two gems when three are needed, and wait around for the third in hopes you will get one. Someone else may only be in need of one more gem to do their turn in, making them wait longer than they need to if the others are taken needlessly.<P>So please take time to donate or save items for the Bank i know this may be a burden on some but others it is not a problem so if you can donate something please let Runical/Runelle know. <P>EPICS<BR>Epic raids won't be a part of the weekly night event. That is not to say that BOTD won't be there to help you obtain your goals. If guild help is needed for an epic drop, look to schedule a raid for yourself during the week and follow the above guidelines. <P>DUO GUILDING<BR>It is possible to have one character in BOTD and an alt or main guided elsewhere. However, we are not an 'alts' guild and do require some semblance of 'face time.' We are a close, tight knit group of friends and it is important that we remember who you are. This can only be done if you play with the guild at least on occasion. It is possible to split your time, if desired.<BR> <P><BR>We are a Guild,<P>A Family. <P>Together We Will Conquer, <P>Together We Will Overwhelm, <P>Together,<P>Nothing Can Stand in our Way.....</TD>
