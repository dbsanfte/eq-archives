<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P>Hello everyone. I've got some news for you that I'm sure you'll like. We plan to have the new PvP Deity Teams server up and running some time tomorrow. I also have the name of the new server and the basic rule set for you below. </P>
<P>What we'll be doing is putting the new server up as a Test server for a short while, a few weeks or it may only be a few days, depending on how things go. In order to play on the server during the testing period you'll have to log in using testeverquest.exe. At the end of the test period we will be wiping all characters from the new server in order to restart it as a Live server. 
<P>The server will be open to anyone that wants to help us test it. You'll have to understand that the standard Test Server disclaimers will apply (see the note below). And our Development Team and Testing Teams will be running around on the server. Please cooperate with them and don't bother them with requests. 
<P>Please use /bug to tell us about any bugs you find with the new rules and PvP code. 
<P>Remember, this is a Test server, and there is no promise of customer service. 
<P>Don't let any of that intimidate you if you want to test out the new rules once we get the server up. Just run testeverquest.exe and start up a character. 
<P>Anyway, on to the rules. This isn't necessarily a final list, we are still thinking of adding and modifying some rules. But this is a pretty good summary. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>And the rules:</STRONG> 
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P>Welcome to Sullon Zek, the first Deity Team PvP server. 
<P>Important Notice: 
<P>This server will only be featured on the Test EQ Patch for some time for testing purposes. You will need to run testeverquest.exe to access this server. While this server is featured on the Test Patch, all the conditions that apply to the Test Server also apply to this server. There may be cases where the server comes down multiple times a day for updates. There is also a small chance of corpse or item loss. There will be very little to no initial customer service support. When testing of this server is complete and the server is ready to be introduced to the Live Servers, all characters will be wiped. Below are the new rules specific to this server. But also be aware that these rules may be changed as we feel the need to adjust them. 
<P>The Sullon Zek server is a new server with a new rule set. The rules for this server are very different than those on any other EverQuest server. In general the server is based on the concept of a PvP teams server, like Tallon and Vallon Zek, but with the teams chosen based on which god the character worships rather than the race of the character. 
<P>This document includes the PvP rules for Sullon Zek, and a list of the teams for the server. The 'teams' will be referred to as 'alliances' in this document, as they represent an alliance of the gods, rather than some sort of sports team… 
<P><B><FONT color=#ffffff>Sullon Zek Rules</FONT>&gt;</B> 
<P>1. Player v. Player (PvP) combat can occur between any characters that are not on the same team, regardless of level. A level 50 character can attack and kill a level 6 character if that character is not a member of his alliance. But rules 2 and 3 apply. 
<P>2. Characters will be immune to PvP combat until they have gained enough strength to survive the struggle. Characters below 6th level are not able to participate in PvP combat. The first time a character zones after gaining 6th level he or she will then become PvP enabled. 
<P>3. Characters will lose experience when killed in PvP combat if the character that killed them is within 5 levels. The amount of experience lost will be the same amount that is lost if that character is killed by an NPC. Your corpse can be resurrected by a cleric to partially restore lost experience. 
<P>4. Characters will only be able to loot coins from other characters, and then only if the victim was within 5 levels of the killer. Only the character getting the killing blow will be able to loot the corpse. 
<P>5. Players may only have one character at a time on this server. This means that you will have to delete the existing character in order to create a new one. Because we are introducing a new class and a new race with the release of Shadows of Luclin we plan to make allowances at that time for those that wish to explore these new characters. 
<P>6. Characters will not be able to group with anyone that is not on their Deity Team. 
<P>7. Characters will not be able to invite someone to join their guild that is not on their Deity Team. 
<P>8. Combat skills' effective value is capped at 2 levels above a players current level. 
<P>9. Resistance debuff spells have a 50% increased effectiveness against player characters. 
<P>10. /consider returns only three kinds of results when used against player characters. 'Green' means that the character is below your range. 'White' or 'black' means that the character is within your range. 'Red' means that they are above your range. 'In range' means +/- 5 levels. 
<P>11. /consider will also display a message indicating what team the target is on. Members of your own team will be displayed as an 'ally', members of another team will be shown as 'threateningly'. 
<P>12. Faction hits for PvP will be taken for killing characters within their racial home towns. Killing a human in any human starting city will cause a faction loss with the locals. Freeport, Qeynos and Surefall Glade are considered starting cities for humans. All of Greater Faydark and Felwithe are considered the starting city for all elves (high elves, wood elves and half elves), except dark elves. Paineel and Erudin are both starting cities for erudites, and killing one in either city (regardless of their place of origin) will result in a faction loss with that city. Other cities are not considered home towns, despite being run and controlled by a certain race. For example, HighHold is not a human home town. Thurgadin is not a dwarven home town. 
<P>13. Rules such as the Play Nice Policy do not apply to this server. Characters have the ability on these servers to deal with their conflicts through combat. Causing experience loss by 'training' NPCs on other characters is not an offense that would warrant a warning on PvP servers. HOWEVER: All rules regarding general decency still apply. Cursing, threats and other such things will be dealt with sternly, and are still unacceptable behavior on PvP servers. 
<P>14. Beneficial effects can not be used on members of another team. 
<P>15. No character will be able to bind in dungeon zones. 
<P>16. Beneficial spells will not affect characters more than 20 levels lower than the spell level. Existing spell restrictions on spells over 50th level will supercede this rule. 
<P>17. There will be 'insignia' dropped on the corpses of characters over 20th level that are killed by another character. We plan to allow those to be turned in for a reward of some sort. What that reward will be is undetermined at this time, but we are leaning towards a team reward rather than a personal reward. 
<P><B><FONT color=#ffffff>The 'Teams'</FONT></B> 
<P>The Good Alliance consists of: Erollisi Marr, Mithaniel Marr, Rodcet Nife, Quellious, Tunare <BR>The Evil Alliance consists of: Bertoxxulous, Cazic Thule, Innoruuk, Rallos Zek <BR>The Neutral Alliance consists of: Brell Serilis, Bristlebane, Karana, Prexus, Solusek Ro, The Tribunal, Veeshan. 
<P>There are no Agnostics on Sullon Zek. With the new influence of the gods, those that had not declared for one deity or another have been killed. Everyone now worships a deity, if not out of respect, love or fear of the god, then out of fear for their lives at the hands of fanatics. 
<P>Barbarian Shaman and Warriors can choose to worship Mithaniel Marr. Mithaniel Marr was unwilling to abandon all of the noble barbarians that served the good, and many declared themselves in favor of an alliance with Good. 
<P>Monks will be able to worship Veeshan. The Temple in Qeynos has discovered some ancient writings that opened up new avenues. 
<P>We will be including a method for the Good and Neutral teams to use Summon Corpse or something similar. </P></BLOCKQUOTE></TD>
