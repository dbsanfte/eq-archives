<A NAME="q1"></A><H2>What is GuidMagic?</H2>
<P>
<B>GuildMagic.com</B> is a system for helping Everquest players and their guild masters to keep useful and accurate lists of their guild members, their levels and their skills.
<P>
<B>Guild leaders</B> will love GuildMagic because they no longer need to make endless changes to their guild roster to keep it up to date. Guild members are responsible for keeping their own character details up to date.
<P>
<B>Guild members</B> will love GuildMagic because managing your characters is easy and GuildMagic allows you to <B>find other characters</B> on your server with a similar level, race, class or timezone. You can even use GuildMagic to find players on your server with <B>trade skills</B> you need!
<P>
<A HREF="#">back to top</A>
<P>

<A NAME="q2"></A><H2>Who wrote GuildMagic and why?</H2>
<P>
GuildMagic was written by an enthusiastic EverQuest player (<A HREF="http://eq.guildmagic.com/character.cfm?ID=11"><B>Lusanne</B></A>) that wanted a way to help out her guild. Lusanne works for a <B>british web design company</B> <A HREF="http://www.otn.co.uk/">On The Net</A> that specialises in developing database driven and <B>e-commerce</B> enabled web sites.
<P>
Guildmagic runs on On The Net's own Windows 2000 based web server and is written using <B>Cold Fusion</B> 4.5.
<P>
<A HREF="#">back to top</A>
<P>

<A NAME="q3"></A><H2>Who's the woman in the picture on the left?</H2>
<P>
That's <A HREF="http://eq.guildmagic.com/character.cfm?ID=11">Lusanne</A> at level 48 stood in The Overthere watching one of Norrath's spectacular sunsets. Lusanne is an <B>Enchantress</B> and is usually in human form. In that picture she's wearing her Crystalline Robes and has put her steins away.
<P>
<A HREF="#">back to top</A>
<P>

<A NAME="q4"></A><H2>Why do I need to create a user?</H2>
<P>
Most EverQuest players have <B>more than one character</B>. In order to give you a single login and password that allows control over all your Everquest characters we needed to create a user and password system.
<P>
Once you have created your user you can make as many characters as you like. Your characters can be on <B>any server</B> and in <B>any guild</B>. Even if you have more than one Everquest account you only need one GuildMagic user.
<P>
<A HREF="#">back to top</A>
<P>

<A NAME="q5"></A><H2>Are you going to sell my email address to advertisers?</H2>
<P>
<B>Absolutely not</B>. Your email address is only required in case you forget your username or password. We have no plans to sell your email address to advertisers. <B>We hate spam.</B> We know how annoying unsolicited email is. We would not subject our users to more of it.
<P>
<A HREF="#">back to top</A>
<P>

<A NAME="q5a"></A><H2>Who will be able to see my email address?</H2>
<P>
You can put an email address on your user and on each character you create under your user. The email address you put on your user will only be visible to your guild leader. The email address you put on your character is visible to anyone.
<P>
<A HREF="#">back to top</A>
<P>

<A NAME="q5b"></A><H2>What if I don't want everyone to see everything about my EverQuest character?</H2>
<P>
You can mark your characters as anonymous, just like in EverQuest. Click <B>edit</B> next to your character on the my user page. On the edit character page there is a tickbox called <B>Character Anonymous</B>. Tick that and click <B>Update Character</B>. Your character information will now only be visible to your guild mates.
<P>
<A HREF="#">back to top</A>
<P>

<A NAME="q6"></A><H2>Are you trying to steal my EQ account?</H2>
<P>
<B>No way!</B> In fact when you create your user you are expressly requested NOT to use your EverQuest account name and password. <B>This service is not run by Verant.</B> We will never need to know you Everquest account name or password for any reason. Do not under any circumstances give those details to us or anyone claiming to be related to GuildMagic.
<P>
<A HREF="#">back to top</A>
<P>

<A NAME="q7"></A><H2>Are versions of GuildMagic planned for Ultima Online/Asheron's Call/Shadowbane/etc?</H2>
<P>
Quite <B>possibly</B>. That will depend on how successful the EverQuest version of GuildMagic is. The system has been designed to be able to cope with whatever new games come along. While GuildMagic is still new I expect to spend <B>more time tweaking</B> the EverQuest version than producing a whole new version for a different game but if you're really keen to see a version for your own game then please <A HREF="mailto:lus@otn.co.uk">email me</A> to let me know. I'll use the number of requests I get to decide which game to develop for next.
<P>
<A HREF="#">back to top</A>
<P>

<A NAME="q7a"></A><H2>The link for my server / class / race is broken / not the best / missing. Can I suggest something?</H2>
<P>
Heck yes. You'll see most classes, races, servers etc have a link to another web site. For example, all the classes link to the Caster's Realm pages for their class. I've tried to link to places that I thought people would find useful. Most things have a link (not all) but if you have a comment or suggestion regarding these links then please <A HREF="mailto:lus@otn.co.uk">email me</A>.
<P>
<A HREF="#">back to top</A>
<P>

<A NAME="q7c"></A><H2>How about letting me put all my characters stats and equipment into the system too?</H2>
<P>
This is something I specifically chose <B>not</B> to add. There are already a few systems out there that do this job very well such as <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com">eq.castersrealm.com</A> and <A HREF="http://everquest.allakhazam.com">everquest.allakhazam.com</A>. Instead of reinventing that wheel I've included a field for each character called 'Character Website' where you can enter the link to your characters entry on one of those other sites.
<P>
<A HREF="#">back to top</A>
<P>


<A NAME="q7d"></A><H2>Are there some images I can use to link from my site to GuildMagic?</H2>
<P>
<B>Yes!</B> Feel free to use the buttons below. In IE right click on the image and choose 'Save Picture As...' from the menu. In Netscape right click on the image and choose 'Save Image As...' from the menu.

<P>

<A NAME="q11"></A><H2>I've forgotten my username or password. What do I do?</H2>
<P>
Go to the login page and click the link that says "I've forgotten my password". You will be taken to a page where you can enter your email address. When you do you will automaticaly be emailed with your username and password. Usernames and passwords will ONLY be emailed to the email address registered against the user. If you change your email address you must update your user details with GuildMagic. Otherwise you risk being unable to recover your username and password if you forget them.
<P>
<A HREF="#">back to top</A>
<P>

<A NAME="q12"></A><H2>Why isn't my guild on the list of available guilds when I create a character?</H2>
<P>
Before you can put your characters into a guild you need to add your guild to your user. You do that by going to your 'my user' page and clicking 'add guilds to my user' in the 'guild memberships' section.
<P>
When you edit your character and put them into a guild you still need to have your guild leader accept that character into the guild. By setting the guild attribute of your character you automatically put a request on your guild leader's 'my user' page. The next time your guild leader logs in they will be able to accept or decline your request to have that character added to the guild.
<P>
<A HREF="#">back to top</A>
<P>

<A NAME="q13"></A><H2>I've edited my character and selected that character's guild from the drop-down list but when I look at the guild roster my chracter isn't listed. What gives?</H2>
<P>
When you edit your character and put them into a guild you still need to have your guild leader accept that character into the guild. By setting the guild attribute of your character you automatically put a request on your guild leader's "my user" page. The next time your guild leader logs in they will be able to accept or decline your request to have that character added to the guild.
<P>
<A HREF="#">back to top</A>
<P>

<A NAME="q14"></A><H2>Can I have characters on different servers?</H2>
<P>
Yes, you can make as many characters as you like under your user. Each character can be on a different server if you like.
<P>
<A HREF="#">back to top</A>
<P>

<A NAME="q15"></A><H2>Can I have characters in different guilds?</H2>
<P>
Yes, you can make as many characters as you like under your user. Each character can be in a different guild if you like.
<P>
<A HREF="#">back to top</A>
<P>

<A NAME="q16"></A><H2>Can I move my character betweens guilds?</H2>
<P>
Yes. Login and go to your 'my user' page (button in the left bar). Click the 'edit' button next to your character name. Now choose your new guild from the drop-down box where it says 'Guild'. If your required guild is not in that list then you need to give your Guildmagic username (not your character name) to the guild master. They will set you up so that you can see their guild on the list.
<P>
<A HREF="#">back to top</A>
<P>

<A NAME="q17"></A><H2>How do I set skills for my character?</H2>
<P>
Login and go to your 'my user' page (button in the left bar). Click the 'skills' button next to your character. On the next page you'll see a list of available skills. Highlight the skill you want to add by clicking on it and then click the 'add skill' button below the box. You'll see a Skill section appear below for the skill you chose. You can set your ability score (1-250) and a description of your capabilities for each skill. When you're finished updating your skills click the 'finish' button at the bottom of the page.
<P>
<A HREF="#">back to top</A>
<P>

<A NAME="q18"></A><H2>How do I link from my own web site to my character's page?</H2>
<P>
When you are logged in to GuildMagic and you view your character page (click 'view' next to your character on your 'my user' page) you'll see a short section at the bottom of the page telling you the HTML code you need to use. 
<P>
You could also just cut/paste the URL from your browser's address bar when you're viewing your character's page.
<P>
<A HREF="#">back to top</A>
<P>

<A NAME="q19"></A><H2>How do I link from my own web site to my guild roster page?</H2>
<P>
When you are logged in to GuildMagic and you view your guild roster page (click 'view guild roster' next to your guild on your 'my user' page) you'll see a short section at the bottom of the page telling you the HTML code you need to use. 
<P>
You can change the sorting options on your guild roster page to the way you like them. When you've done that the HTML at the bottom of the page will make the link that you put on your own page come out sorted the way you left it.
<P>
You could also just cut/paste the URL from your browser's address bar when you have your guild roster page looking the way you like.
<P>
<A HREF="#">back to top</A>
<P>

<A NAME="q19a"></A><H2>My server is splitting. How do I move my character to a new server?</H2>
<P>
Moving your character to a new server is as simple as editing your character (on your 'my user' page click 'edit' next to your character name). Next choose the name of the new server from the drop-down list titled 'Server'. 
<P>
Your guild administrator can move the guild to the new server independantly of this. Moving your character or guild to a new server will not remove you from the guild roster.
<P>
<A HREF="#">back to top</A>
<P>

<A NAME="q19b"></A><H2>How come I can see all the details about this supposedly anonymous character here?</H2>
<P>
You can set your characters to be anonymous by editing them and clicking the <B>Character Anonymous</B> tickbox. This makes your character information hidden from everyone except your guild mates.
<P>
If you can see the details about a character that you know is set as anonymous then it must be because you have a character in the same guild as them.
<P>
<A HREF="#">back to top</A>
<P>

<A NAME="q19b"></A><H2>Why can't I use find character to find a character I KNOW is in GuildMagic?</H2>
<P>
The character you're searching for is probably set as anonymous. Anonymous characters don't show up in Find Characters. This is because Find Characters can be used to look for certain races/classes/levels etc. Someone could find out all the information about an anonymous character that would normally be hidden by performing a series of searches.
<P>
<A HREF="#">back to top</A>
<P>

<A NAME="q20"></A><H2>How do I create a guild?</H2>
<P>
Login and go to your 'my user' page. From there find the 'guild memberships' section and click the 'create new guild' button. You can set your guild name, guild web site and the server your new guild is on. These details can be edited later if they change. If your guild has branches on more than one server then you will need to make a separate guild for each server. It is possible to have two guilds with the same name on different servers.
<P>
<A HREF="#">back to top</A>
<P>

<A NAME="q21"></A><H2>Can I be the administrator for more than one guild?</H2>
<P>
Yes, you can make as many guilds as you like under your user. Each guild you are administrator for will have a separate section on your 'my user' page.
<P>
<A HREF="#">back to top</A>
<P>

<A NAME="q22"></A><H2>How do I allow my guild members to put their characters into my guild?</H2>
<P>
Before your guild members can try to add their characters to your guild you will need to get their GuildMagic usernames (not their character names) from them. When you have their username you should login and go to your 'my user' page. From there find the 'guild admin' section for your guild and enter their username in the box by the 'add user' button. Click the button and thay user can now start putting their characters in your guild. 
<P>
Before those characters will appear on your guild roster, though, you will need to accept or decline each character. As your guild members put their characters into your guild they will automatically generate a request that appears on your 'my user' page. Each request shows the username, character name and character details (level, race, class). You can accept or decline each character. When you are done you should click the 'edit characters' button in order to set each character with the correct 'role' (eg Trialist, Member, Leader etc). You can edit the roles list and make your own roles if you wish.
<P>
<A HREF="#">back to top</A>
<P>

<A NAME="q22a"></A><H2>Some of my guild members have created their characters but haven't requested to have them added to the guild. How can add them?</H2>
<P>
If you a guild administrator you can invite your missing guild mates into your guild by clicking <B>recruit characters</B> on your admin controls. This takes you to a list of all the characters on your guild's server that aren't presently in a guild.

<A NAME="q23"></A><H2>How do I make one of my guild members into a guild administrator?</H2>
<P>
Guild administrators are made at a user level, not a character level. Login and go to your 'my user' page. Click the 'edit users' button on your 'guild admin' section. You'll see a list of all the users in your guild and below each one is a list of all the characters they have in your guild. If you click the 'edit' button next to one of those users you'll be able to set them as an administrator by ticking the 'Admin' box and clicking 'save'.
<P>
BEWARE! Do not give admin status to anyone that you do no trust implicitly. All guild  administrators have the same abilities in the GuildMagic system. Although you can never remove your own admin status, one of the other administrators CAN remove your admin status.

Login and go to your 'my user' page. In the 'guild admin' section click the 'edit roles' button. You'll see a list of all the roles available to your guild. This list is in order with the most senior role at the top.

<P>
When you are done click 'finished' at the bottom. Next you should click 'edit characters' back on your 'my user' page to make sure that your guild members are all set with the the correct roles.
