<H2>What's the deal with the PayPal link?</H2>
<P>
Ok, we'd like to keep GuildMagic running. Better still we'd like to keep adding to the system, making it better and better. But the speed problems are really getting us (and you) down. Here's the deal - we'll agree to provide a new dedicated server to run GuildMagic on if you folks will agree to pay for the bandwidth (the internet connection). That means that we'd like you to consider making a voluntary contribution towards our internet connection costs. We'll basically buy whatever we can afford to on the money you donate. You can contribute whatever you feel is a fair amount by clicking this PayPal button.
<P>
We've attempted to answer some common questions in the rest of this document.

<H2>Why is GuildMagic running slowly?</H2>
<P>
Quite simply we need more bandwidth.
<P>
The current site is running on a pretty fast machine but the leased line internet connection is just plain overloaded. We're keen to be open and honest with our figures so you can find out more about the costs for running GuildMagic in the "What does it cost to provide GuildMagic?" section below.
<P>
<H2>Do I get anything special for donating?</H2>
<P>
How about our undying gratitude? :-)
<P>
Ok, how about this.. Any person donating more than $30 gets to advertise the guild of their choice on the GuildMagic home page with a graphical button linked to the guild's stat's and info page for 1 month. You'll need to supply me with a 120x32 image. Alternatively you could use your free 1 month ad to advertise anything you like (as long as it's legal, and suitable for a PG13 audience!).
<P>
<H2>Why don't you charge people to use GuildMagic?</H2>
<P>
GuildMagic is provided free of charge. We believe this is important because a system like this is only useful if as many people as possible sign up and use it. 
<P>
<H2>What about advertising?</H2>
<P>
Advertising just doesn't pay for a site like GuildMagic any more. The bottom has dropped out of the internet advertising market. We hate pop-up ads as much as you do and we're trying hard to avoid using them to generate income. Pop-ups do still generate some income, though so we've not totally ruled that option out yet.
<P>
<H2>How can I help?</H2>
<P>
You can help by making a voluntary contribution towards the hosting costs for the web site. We don't expect everyone will contribute. In fact we have no idea how many will - we've never done anything like this before - so we don't know how much to ask for. Go with your conscience.
<P>
<H2>What does it cost to provide GuildMagic?</H2>
<P>
We don't expect to give up our jobs on the income from GuildMagic. Sure that would be nice but we're realistic. We'll just be happy if the site pays for its own internet costs. At the moment our internet link costs £2500 per year. That pays for a 128k leased line. As soon as we can see that the site is generating some income we'll be building a new dedicated server for GuildMagic (currently it shares a server with some of "On The Net"s customers) and moving that new server onto a dedicated internet connection. We'll buy whatever we can afford with the money you donate. Bear in mind, though, that the 128k connection we have a the moment is almost totally used up just by GuildMagic.
<P>
So the deal is - you pay for the internet link, we'll pay for the server.
<P>
<H2>What is PayPal?</H2>
<P>
PayPal is a really easy, secure way to send money to someone. It's the same system Allakhazam is using and it's also incredibly popular with e-bay users. You sign up with their system, tell them about your bank account and from then on you can send money to people and pay for stuff with just an email address and a password. Find out more <A HREF="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_home" TARGET="_blank">here</A> or click the PayPal button above to sign up and then send us your donation.
