2. Has an Afterlife member agreed to sponsor you? If so, who? If more
than one person agreed to sponsor you, list them all.  Your sponsor
should be someone who can answer any questions you have about the way
Afterlife operates.  Your sponsor is also someone who will vouch for you
as a good recruit.

leadership -- some aspect of running a raid, or perhaps a guild conflict
handled while an officer.  Give a play by play of how you handled the
situation.  Explain what you did and why you did it.  What mistakes did
you make?  What would you do differently now?  What did you learn?
<p><center><textarea name="answer15" cols=60 rows=10></textarea></center><p>

10. If you were given 30 seconds to teach a newbie how to play your
primary character, what would you say to that person? What is the most
critical element of your game play?  This isn't a trick question; we
know you wouldn't let someone else play your account, and we know you
couldn't teach them to play as well as you do.  We want to know how well
you can convey the basics of your class.

<p><center><textarea name="answer21" cols=60 rows=10></textarea></center><p>

16a.  What is your best EverQuest memory/experience ever?  This doesn't
have to be raid related, although it may be.
