<h3>Background</h3>
It is assumed that anyone reading this paper has at least heard of
Everquest. &nbsp;Everquest is a Massively Multiplayer Online Game
(MMOG). &nbsp;It has a level based character advancement system. &nbsp;It
takes from 40 to 100 days of /play time (each day is 24 hours spent
playing, so 10 days /play is 240 hours) for someone's first character
to get to the original level cap of 50.
<p>
Kunark was the first expansion shipped for Everquest. &nbsp;One of the
features of the expansion, for many people the main feature, was an increase
in the level cap from the old cap of level 50, to a new cap of level 60.
<p>
<h3>So what's the problem?</h3>
Because of the time it took for the first expansion to come out, a great
many people were at the level 50 cap before Kunark. &nbsp;All were ready and eager
for more levels. &nbsp;All of them naturally expected to hit level 60 in very little
time. &nbsp;After all, each had obtained level 50, and level 60 is simply 20% more.
<p>
The major concern before Kunark shipped was that everyone would be
level 60 in a week. &nbsp;Once level 60 they would have little to do,
boredom would set in, and many would leave the game. &nbsp;The designers
solved this by making the new levels take much, <b>much</b> longer to
pass through than the old levels.
<p>
Kunark is frequently pointed to and described as a major mistake.&nbsp;
People say that it takes too long to level to 60, and that level 60 is
"required" to play the game. &nbsp;Levelling they say is boring, and they
want to be done with it, and be 60, so they can "play the game". &nbsp;In
a nutshell, this is the <u>Kunark Problem</u>.
<p>
<h3>The Purpose of Levels</h3>
Why do levels exist in a game at all? &nbsp;Lets consider the early game of most any level based RPG.
&nbsp;Generally the player starts at level one,
walks outside, and starts killing mobs around his level. &nbsp;The level
one player can't travel very far, because mobs quickly become far too
powerful to defeat, and happily eat level one players that wander out
of their pen. &nbsp;The character is thus confined to the newbie areas,
where there are mobs that he can kill. &nbsp;After an hour or so, the
character reaches level 2. &nbsp;Now the area the character can kill in
increases. &nbsp; After another level or two the level 1 mobs are no
longer worth killing. &nbsp;By this point, the character has completely
left the area he was killing in before, and is killing in a new area.
&nbsp;Elapsed time: about 10 hours.
<p>
What if there were no levels? &nbsp;What if all mobs were level 1, and
all players were level 1, and never advanced? &nbsp;There is nothing
preventing the player from leaving the newbie area right away.&nbsp;
Instead of 10 hours in the newbie area, the player spends 5 minutes there,
then travels to the next area. &nbsp;And the next. &nbsp;And the next.&nbsp;
Instead of taking 40-100 days /played to explore everything as it did
in original Everquest, it would take at most 1.
<p>
Exploration done so easily has little value. &nbsp;Everyone would see
Nagafen and Vox on the first day, and since Nagafen and Vox would be
level 1, they would easily be killed by whoever felt like walking there.
&nbsp;There would be no sense of accomplishment, no sense of wonder, no
anticipation and desire to see these rare places, because they wouldn't
be rare.
<p>
Add levels and suddenly the game is far more compelling and interesting.
&nbsp;Levels also add another dimension: replayability. &nbsp;This isn't
just playing a character up from level 1 a second time, this is visiting
the same place visited before, but at a different level. &nbsp;The location
is unchanged; the monsters are the same level, the zone has exactly the
same geometry...but it's fun, different, and exciting, because the <b>player</b>
changed. 
<p>
It's the player changing the makes the world vibrant and dynamic, not the
content itself. &nbsp;I've been to the same dungeons over and over again
as my levels have changed, and each time it's interesting in a different
way. &nbsp;The first time it's hard and challenging with a full group,
or even multiple groups. &nbsp;Later it's hard and challenging with less
than a full group.  &nbsp;Eventually, assuming a level cap isn't reached,
the dungeon can be killed in while solo.
<p>
Thus levels serve two important functions: they slow down the consumption of
content, and they create a dynamic game.
<p>
<h3>Kunark has levels, what's the problem?</h3>
<p>
Lets look at Kunark content. &nbsp;There are several dungeons for
level 51+ in Kunark: Karnor's Castle (karnors), Old Sebilis (sebilis),
Chardok, and Howling Stones/Charasis (charasis). &nbsp;Each one of these
dungeons is extensive and interesting, and entertaining for hours of game
play.&nbsp; In fact, these dungeons are compelling for easily 2 days of
/play time (at 4 hours each RL day, that's 12 days playing there every
day) each, and maybe depending on the player/group, some dungeons may
be good for as long as 3 days, if revisted at later levels.
<p>
Now lets do some math. &nbsp;Each dungeon is good for 2-3 days of
/play time.  &nbsp;There are four major dungeons, so that's 8-12 days of
/play time they're good for. &nbsp;It takes from 35 to 50 days /played
to get from 51 to 60.  &nbsp;35 days - 12 days = 23 days unaccounted
for...using the longest possible entertainment time for each dungeon,
and the shortest possible (without heavy twinking) time to reach 60 from
level 51. &nbsp;Worst case is 42 days. &nbsp;What happens for those
other 23-42 days? &nbsp;All content at that point has been consumed.
&nbsp;The extra days are work. &nbsp;Endless repetition, not for enjoyment
or entertainment, but solely to gain levels.
<p>
There are other things to do, but they involve large numbers of people
raiding big mobs, and to do those things most guilds want, or even require,
level 60 players. &nbsp;These are end game tasks, things to keep players
busy once they reach 60, and they are balanced to be challanging at
that level. &nbsp;This is why players feel they are required to get 60 -
they are, in order to continue consuming new content.
<p>
A related problem is based on player bahavior. &nbsp;Some players will go
to karnors at level 51, and not leave until after 55. &nbsp;Why?&nbsp;
Because they know the area, they know people there and thus can group
with them, and the most important reason, the game doesn't encourage them
to leave. &nbsp;The mobs in karnors give xp day after day after day after
day. &nbsp;What if the level 1 mobs in the newbie area gave xp at level 5?
&nbsp;Level 10? &nbsp;Level 20?&nbsp; What if they gave roughly the same
xp as level 20 mobs? &nbsp;That's the problem with kunark. &nbsp;The mobs
in karnors are blue, and thus good xp, for all of those levels, all of those
days spent playing.
<p>
Kunark is content weak assuming 100% consumption of that
content. &nbsp;For those that sit in one dungeon for all 10 levels,
it's pain beyond description.
<p>
<h3>A Better Kunark</h3>
<p>
How could Kunark be done differently? &nbsp;Or more importantly, how can this
be avoided in other games? &nbsp;The key is not the total time it takes to
reach the level cap. &nbsp;That value can be arbitrarily large, or even infinite.
&nbsp;The key is avoiding content burnout, by never forcing, or even allowing,
a player to continuously play in the same area.
<p>
In this fictional, improved, Kunark, karnors may only be good while level 51.
&nbsp;At level 52, the front half of karnors would give no xp; instead, the player
would have to move deeper, to the more interesting (and harder) basement and deep
castle areas. &nbsp;At 53, those areas would no longer give xp, and the player
would then move to the front half of sebilis. &nbsp;Levels 54-58 take much longer
than 51-53, so for those levels, each one takes an entire dungeon:
<p>
<table border=0>
<tr><th>Level</th><th>Location</th></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>front half of karnors</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>back half of karnors</td></tr>
<tr><td>53</td><td>front half of charasis</td></tr>
<tr><td>54</td><td>back half of charasis/chardok</td></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>chardok/sebilis</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>sebilis/?</td></tr>
<tr><td>57</td><td>?</td></tr>
<tr><td>58</td><td>?</td></tr>
<tr><td>59</td><td>?</td></tr>
<tr><td>60</td><td>?</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Which further illustrates that there isn't enough content in Kunark for
51-60, which we already knew. &nbsp;But it's more than just a lack of
content; even if there were 100 different interesting dungeons, some
players are going to stay in the first one they come to until either 1)
the game makes them move (because killing there is no longer beneficial),
or 2) they burn out on EQ and quit.
<p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
Because of the Kunark problem, many people are burned out on the idea of
levelling in general. &nbsp;Pain, once experienced, is avoided in the future.
&nbsp;At this point it will be difficult to overcome this aversion in future
games.
<p>
UO had no level system, and very little progression in their skill system.&nbsp;
There was thus little barrier to consuming content, making UO a short term game.
&nbsp;The long term selling points are PvP and Community, both of which are nice,
and both of which are worthwhile. &nbsp;There are plenty of games (FPS) that
are pure PvP. &nbsp;There are plenty of things that are pure Community (IRC).
&nbsp;Both approaches are compelling to the people that enjoy them.
<p>
Levels (or a good substitute) add a great deal to any game. &nbsp;The
key points being the limiting of consumption of content (and this is
far more than just saving development time, the wait and anticipation
is often more enjoyable than the actual consumption, true entertainment
comes from within) and the game world as a dynamic place through the
change of the player.
<p>
Still, as I said before, many are burned by Kunark. &nbsp;Most games currently
under development are shooting for the persistent PvP and 3d IRC crowds more
than true RPG world exploration and character development, simply because of
the negative reaction most players have towards levelling after Kunark.
<p>
It will be another generation before levels are seen as useful again.
&nbsp;At that time, I hope this paper is useful.
