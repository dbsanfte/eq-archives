1. Carefully read over the requirements found at
<a href="http://www.afterlifeguild.org/?page=joining">
http://www.afterlifeguild.org/?page=joining</a>.  If you do not meet all
of the level, item, skill, and other requirements, please list which ones,
and why.  Unless there are special circumstances, applicants that do not meet all requirements will be rejected.  If you have any
questions about the requirements, email recruiter@afterlifeguild.org
and ask before submitting this application.
<p><center><textarea name="answer1" cols=60 rows=10></textarea></center><p>

2. Has an Afterlife member agreed to sponsor you? If so, who? If more
than one person agreed to sponsor you, list them all.  Your sponsor
should be someone who can answer any questions you have about the way
Afterlife operates.  Your sponsor is also someone who will vouch for you
as a good recruit.
<p><center><textarea name="answer2" cols=60 rows=10></textarea></center><p>

3. Which Afterlife members have you grouped with, and what did you do
while grouped?  What was the group/raid's mission, and what was your
role?
<p><center><textarea name="answer3" cols=60 rows=10></textarea></center><p>

4a. List all your 55+ characters (name/class/level/race).  Only list
characters to which you have exclusive access.
<p><center><textarea name="answer4" cols=60 rows=10></textarea></center><p>

4b. List all your characters of the 20th level or higher whom you would
plan on guilding should your application be accepted.

on raids?
<p><center><textarea name="answer6" cols=60 rows=10></textarea></center><p>

6. List all the guilds you've been in and why you left them.  If you are
currently guilded, why do you wish to leave them?
(Guild/dates/levels/reason for leaving)
<p><center><textarea name="answer7" cols=60 rows=10></textarea></center><p>

7. List any problems you've had with Afterlife or its members.  List the
member's name and explain the situation.

of the other applicants?

within EverQuest?
<p><center><textarea name="answer11" cols=60 rows=10></textarea></center><p>

9a.  Think of a specific instance in which you had to exercise
leadership -- some aspect of running a raid, or perhaps a guild conflict
handled while an officer.  Give a play by play of how you handled the
situation.  Explain what you did and why you did it.  What mistakes did
you make?  What would you do differently now?  What did you learn?
<p><center><textarea name="answer12" cols=60 rows=10></textarea></center><p>

10. If you were given 30 seconds to teach a newbie how to play your
primary character, what would you say to that person? What is the most
critical element of your game play?  This isn't a trick question; we
know you wouldn't let someone else play your account, and we know you
couldn't teach them to play as well as you do.  We want to know how well
you can convey the basics of your class.
<p><center><textarea name="answer13" cols=60 rows=10></textarea></center><p>

11. What connection (modem, dsl, cable, ect) and hardware (CPU, RAM,

12. How many days a week do you play, and what are your normal playing
hours?  Please distinguish between your weekday and weekend schedule.

elaborate.

13. How many days do you have played on your primary character?  If you
have more days played on another character, how many days do you have
played on it, and what class/level is it?
<p><center><textarea name="answer16" cols=60 rows=10></textarea></center><p>

14a.  What is your best EverQuest memory/experience ever?  This doesn't
have to be raid related, although it may be.
<p><center><textarea name="answer17" cols=60 rows=10></textarea></center><p>

14b.  What is your worst EverQuest memory/experience ever?  This also
doesn't have to be raid related, although it may be.
<p><center><textarea name="answer18" cols=60 rows=10></textarea></center><p>

15.  Rate yourself from 1 to 5 on the following attributes, 1 being
sub-par, 5 being excellent.  Give a ONE LINE elaboration on each.  If
you give yourself fives across the board, I expect you to back it up.

others?
<p><center><textarea name="answer24" cols=60 rows=10></textarea></center><p>

16. The character with which you apply will be the character you are
expected to bring to raids.  You will only have one main character in
the eyes of Afterlife.  Do you understand and agree to this?
<p><center><textarea name="answer25" cols=60 rows=10></textarea></center><p>

17. What Alternate Advancement abilities have you purchased?  Or, if 
it's easier, which AA abilities have you not purchased? (specify which you are answering)
