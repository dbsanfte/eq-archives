ITEM: <b>Drum Animation.</b><p>

DESCRIPTION: Bards look like they are carrying a flute when they are carrying a drum. And when they play that flute/drum, the strum it.<p>
</i>
<b>
This is not really a balance issue, but more of a cosmetic/bug issue.
Do we really want to discuss bug issues here?  If so, the number one
bug is instruments don't increase haste/slowdown values.

<HR>
ITEM: <b>Song Damage Post 50.</b><p>

DESCRIPTION: Most bard songs are intended to be used throughout the life
of the bard. But bard damage songs don't seem to grow enough in their
damage for levels over 50. Considering the difficulty of these levels,
and the dramatic increase in the power of the monsters at those levels,
perhaps a damage increase is warranted. And example from a player:
"Chant series as an example (a targeted DoT), from level 40 to 50,
the song increases from 39 damage for 3 ticks to 48 damage for 3 ticks
(+23%). From levels 50 to 60 it'll go from 48x3 to 57x3 (+19%). You
designed the level 50+ spells to represent a larger increase in power
than just 10 levels." The damage increases as a flat number (9 points)
over both level ranges. But levels 40-50 are much more linear, both in
experience and in difficulty, than are 51-60. So perhaps increasing the
damage of bard songs in this level range is in order.<p>

NOTE: Chords of Dissonance, Brusco's Boastful Bellow, Denon's Disruptive
Discord, Denon's Desperate Durge, Fufil's Curtailing Chant, Tuyen's
Chant of Frost, and Tuyen's Chant of Flame.<p>
</i>
<b>
Good item.<p>
</b>

<HR>
ITEM: <b>Cassindra's Insipid Ditty.</b><p>

DESCRIPTION: This is a level 57 song, and it's a single target. It drains
1.5 mana/sec at level 57 (according to a player). This does seem low. I am
told that this song would take four minutes to drain the same mana that an
enchanter can drain with one spell in 11 seconds. It also has a wis/int
debuff component so it will not stack with itself (and it is therefore
more useful than just a drain), that means that only a single bard can be
using it on a target. An increase in the mana drain does seem warranted.<p>
</i>
<b>
Good item.<p>
</b>
<i>
<HR>
ITEM: <b>Resists.</b><p>

DESCRIPTION: One of the key things that bards offer their groups,
especially at higher levels, is resistance boosting. Bards would like
to see a greater value for resists that get up to or near 255. There is
also a rumor that there is a roll-over bug when resists exceed 255 that
should be dispelled.<p>
</i>
<b>
Resists over 255 don't roll over, but there isn't much evidence that they
do anything.  With 500 MR I resist all fears from Klandicar.  People with
100 say they resist most, with 175 they say they resist all.  With 430
MR I resisted very little from the enchanter warder in ST.  Resists may
or may not be working properly, but it's certain that having a bard is
not as useful as having another class, and this is with MR - the resist
a bard can buff far beyond all others.<p>
</b>
<i>
<hr>
ITEM: <b>Haste Song Stacking.</b><p>

DESCRIPTION: Haste songs don't seem to stack with spells in the same
way that other songs do. The problem seems to be that only the largest
haste will actually work (though the icon will appear for lesser haste
effects), and the bard song is never the largest haste. They would like
haste songs to add in all cases to other haste effects. The thought is
that since there is a cap on haste anyway, why not just let songs help
them reach it sooner. Another idea would be to reduce their haste and
let them stack, or make a new line that parallels these songs and is
stackable, but with a smaller haste.<p>
</i>
<b>
This misses the point.  See <a
href="http://www.afterlifeguild.org/Thott/haste_stacking.html">Haste
Stacking</a>.  This link is well written and explains the haste stacking
issue in its entirity, and explains it well.  There is info there that
you will not be aware of if you haven't read it.<p>

Something to ponder: why does the haste cap exist?  Until that question
is answered, there isn't much that can done with bards.  The real answer
is in the above link.
<p>
This issue is the most important issue of all, and deserves the most
time.
<p>
The Ervaj line should be removed, and all bard haste songs should stack,
in full, with all non-bard hastes.  This is not powerful - but it is
required.
<p>
artebus replied:<br>
<i>
While your haste stacking writeup is great, I wonder if it's too deep
for what they are looking for in this list. It seems like they want to
encapsulate all issues in a very brief, simple manner, which isn't fair
but is what they are doing.
<p>
</i>
I can write a simpler version, but it will necessarily be less
complete.  Let me know if it is needed.<p>
</b>

<HR>
ITEM: <b>Song Effects on Items.</b><p>

DESCRIPTION: With the way bard songs work, putting them on items is
really rather annoying to the bard. They have to re-click the item every
time the song stops, which in many cases can be only a few seconds. Bard
song items are, essentially, just extra spell gems for them, which they
need to make hot keys for and twist just like any other song. Perhaps
these items could play until clicked off, or at least greatly increase
the duration of songs on items. But doing so would, basically, allow
bards to have tons of songs up at once. This would be a huge imbalance
for the class. So, I guess, this item is listed to point this problem
out and hope that someone has an idea about how to fix it.<p>
</i>
<b>
This applies to Breath of Harmony and the new Velious BP effect.  Breath
of Harmony is an instant cast song, which can be twisted in with other
songs.  This isn't any different from regular twisting.  However, there is
a long standing bug that use of this item triggers fairly often, that being
the "stuck song" bug.
<p>
The Velious BP effect is horribly broken.
<p>
Neither of these are real balance issues.
<p>
</b>
<i>
<HR>
ITEM: <b>Bard 'Snare' Songs.</b><p>

DESCRIPTION: Chain, Largo's Absonant Binding (51), and Assonant Strane
(L54 AE movement slowdown) are all random in duration.  Bards would
like to see at least some minimum duration on the effects of these
songs. They are also of the opinion that Selo's Consonant Chain it too
easily resisted.<p>
</i>
<b>
History: originally, ALL snare type effects except for the level 1 snare
itself had random durations.  This included the snare upgrade, ensnare,
and the entire darkness line.  Over time, all of these spells have
been changed to be reliable.  The bard songs were simply overlooked.
<p>
Kenross replied:<br>
<i>
These are relatively trivial in the grand scheme of things, but
infuriate me the most. These show me just how little Verant understands
Bards. Putting a random duration on a song that lasts a maximum of 15
seconds, and that features as one of its components a MOB debuff, is
just plain stupid. If I twist this for the debuff, it doesn't even last
one full song-cycle, which makes it a LOT LESS USEFUL than it appears
to be on paper. And if I sing this repeatedly for the snare effect
alone, it DOESN'T SNARE. <p>
</i>
</b>
<i>
<HR>
ITEM: <b>Pick Locks.</b><p>

DESCRIPTION: Bards get pick locks rather late in life, and they also
have a skill cap. They get it at 40th level, and the skill caps at some
number not much higher than 40. The problem here is that they get the
skill so late that there are no locks for them to pick that are not
either trivial or beyond their reach. Obviously this would be less of a
problem if there were more mid-level locks to pick, so further content
alone might fix this situation. This may be something that can be left
as is with the intent of fixing it with additional content. But it might
also be a good idea to raise the skill cap on this skill.<p>
</i>
<b>
Most locks fall into one of two categories: requires 200 skill, or
requires more than 200 skill.  Bards, having 100 skill, can pick only
fluke locks that have no skill requirement.  I suggest having the bard
pick lock skill increase by 10 points for every level past 50, up to a
cap of 200 at 60.  This gives bards the pick lock capability of a rogue
20 levels their junior.<p>

Is this a real balance issue?  No, not really.  The only real issues are
song damage and haste stacking, both of which are related to <a 
href="http://www.afterlifeguild.org/Thott/powercurves.html">Bard Power
Curves</a>.<p>
</b>
<i>
<HR>
ITEM: <b>Singing Steel Boots, Greaves and Breastplate.</b><p>

DESCRIPTION: If there are going to be items that summon food and water,
how about letting them summon a larger amount of food and water.<p>

The boots give an error message when used, even though they deliver
their summoned item properly (annoying bug).<p>

The breastplate does Invigorate, which heals far less (when you
include the casting time) than could be healed just by singing the
song. Considering that bard songs cost no mana, and healing songs are
almost always memorized, the effect on the breastplate isn't going to
be used.<p>
</i>
<b>
I was quite impressed when I saw the SS boots effect.  Bard forage has
a low cap.  Forage tends to produce far more food than water.  Thus a
common bard problem is having plenty of food, but not enough water.  The
boots fix this.<p>

Then I saw the legs.<p>

In any event, ignoring the legs and boots, the BP is now the shining
example of dev team apathy towards bards.  As soon as the effect was known
it was brought to the attention of the dev team.  After a great deal of
screaming, Abashi finally admitted that the effect should be upgraded.
Since then, the rogue BP has been nerfed once and the cleric BP nerfed
twice, yet still, the bard BP is unchanged.<p>

Now the new bard BP has a new effect, and it too is utterly useless, and
again, it is the only BP that is so crippled.<p>

It's hard for bards to not feel badly about this.<p>

Even if the bugs in the first version of the Velious BP were fixed, it
will still be a useless effect.  Why would bards want a song that can't
be twisted with other songs on an item?  It makes no sense.  It doesn't
even save a combat song slot, because it isn't a combat song.  Some of
the other BP's are very powerful, the bard BP should be equally powerful.
That is, indeed, what balance is all about.
<p>
</b>
<i>
<HR>
ITEM: <b>The "song ends" "song starts" "song ends" bug.</b><p>

DESCRIPTION: This is still around.<p>
</i>
<b>
This occurs when a new song (or buff) goes up just as the old song
(or buff) fades.  It's some kind of race condition.  It does happen
with buffs, I've seen it myself several times, but it happesn very
frequently with songs, because songs are always put up just as they
fall.<p>

This can be reproduced by sitting around for a bit trying to get a
song to pop up just as it falls.<p> 

This isn't a balance issue, it's a bug.<p>
</b>
<i>
<HR>
ITEM: <b>Mana Regeneration (Meditation).</b><p>

DESCRIPTION: Denon's Desparate Dirge uses 800 mana. Death uses up all of
it? Because bards don't benefit from any form of mana regen, 800 mana
takes about 40 minutes to regenerate sitting. Perhaps we should allow
bards to meditate like other casters to reduce that downtime. Keep the
restriction on mana regeneration songs and spells, but give them full
meditation and the benefits from that.<p>
</i>
<b>
I'd just have bard mana not be removed on res.  I die all the time.
I can go for days and not have enough mana to use this song.
<p>
Paschendale responded:<br>
<i>
So true - I know when we are raiding cause I am very rarely with more
than a bub of blue :)  Do I ever use this song, hell no.
<p>
I know their reasonings for killing mana after a res or a duel, but I
cannot see how those reasons affect bards. What are we going to do? Mem
a song right away and kill someone? ROFL We cannot even kill a mid level
player with that song.
<p>
I would be interested to hear non-carebear server bards opinion on this.
<p>
</i>
</b>
<i>
<HR>
ITEM: <b>Song of Shields (49).</b><p>

DESCRIPTION: This song has no message. Previously it was spamming the
group with messages, and now it gives none. It would be nice if to have
it generate a single message like all other bard songs.<p>
</i>
<b>
Another bug.<p>
</b>
<i>
<HR>
ITEM: <b>Aria of Eagles (31, levitate) and Song of Travel (51).</b><p>

DESCRIPTION: These songs don't give any message when they're about to
expire. The message were removed in response to complaints about the
spam. From a player: "The correct fix is to increase the duration of
these songs by one tick so the message isn't generated for at least one
tick, by which time the song's next pulse will refresh it. You had this
correct fix in place with Aria. Then you removed the message entirely
from both songs when you "fixed" Song of Travel."<p>
</i>
<b>
Again, not exactly a balance issue.<p>
</b>
<i>
<HR>
ITEM: <b>Kellin's Lucid Lullaby.</b><p>

DESCRIPTION: Some players feel that this song is far too resistible, that
the secondary resist is too high. It seems to be useful enough at the
lower levels, and becomes nearly useless later. If this is intentional,
then that's fine. If not, lowering the secondary resist a bit might be
nice. A bard gets this song at level 15. It becomes relatively worthless
at 30. Most bards songs either retain their relative usefulness, or
actually increase in power as levels increase.<p>
</i>
<b>
Isn't this horse dead?  At some point, however, when the same thing is
said by enough players, it may be time to realize that hey, maybe the
players are right.<p>
</b>
<i>
<HR>
ITEM: <b>Old song fades and cancels new song.</b><p>

DESCRIPTION: If a song ends at the same time that the new version of the
same song starts, the new song will fade out when the old one does. This
also happens to spells, but it's much less common because they overlap
less frequently. This is annoying the heck out of the bards.<p>
</i>
<b>
Duplicate item.<p>
</b>
<i>
<HR>
ITEM: <b>'End of Song' Spam.</b><p>

DESCRIPTION: When a bard stops singing, people see "%t's song ends"
twice. This seems to be unnecessary spam.<p>
</i>
<b>
Another bug.<p>
</b>
<i>
<HR>
ITEM: <b>Bardic Charm.</b><p>

DESCRIPTION: There seems to be a bug where the bard gets a success message
from a charm song, but he still does not have any actual control over the
pet. The pet will also occasionally attack party members, but the party
can't attack it back because it is a pet. Also, bard charm seems to be
capped at a level lower than enchanter charm. Is this how it should be?<p>
</i>
<b>
A level 60 bard has the same charm cap as a level 39 bard - a difference
of 21 levels with no change.<p>

Recharmed pets will attack players quite often.  I never see it happen
on the first charm, only when the mob breaks charm and is recharmed.
Since bard charm still does not work on charmed mobs except on the true
PvP (not teams) server, bards have to recharm their pets many times
during a fight, which causes this bug to crop up quite often.<p>

This could be used exploitively to kill a player on a blue server.<p>

Is this a balance issue?  If it includes changing charm so that it can
be refreshed on all servers, perhaps.  The charm cap is definitely a
balance issue.<p>
</b>
<i>
<HR>
ITEM: <b>Song Twisting.</b><p>

DESCRIPTION: The problem is, the ability to twist songs is what separates
the bad bards from the reasonably good bards (it takes more than the
ability to twist to be a great bard, though). So while some bards are
calling for us to come up with a way that they can twist songs without
all the repetitive motion, others consider it part of the challenge of
the class and want us to leave it as it is. Perhaps songs could keep
going once started. Allow more than one song to run at a time this way,
restrict it by either limiting this to three at a time, or have the
number that could be sung at the same time by level, perhaps one at a
time to 19th level, two at a time from 20th to 39th level, and three
from then on. But also allow songs to be turned off as they are now,
to continue to allow twisting.<p>
</i>
<b>
Maybe twisting is part of the price bards pay for their power.  A better
question is, what power?  So perhaps twisting should be removed or
augmented.<p>

It used to be that there were a sizeable number of players playing bards.
One by one they left, either switching to some other class or moving to
some other game/RL.  Very few high level bards remain.  None that have
left have cited twisting as a reason.  In every case it had to do with
the uselessness of the bard at high levels, or the simple realization
that what they thought would be good about the class (no mana "spells")
was actually a disadvantage, not an advantage.<p>

Augmenting twisting would probably increase the number of bards at low
levels, while possibly alienating some mid and high level bards.  The
class would become more like other classes, and lose some uniqueness.<p>

Personally, I twist without conscious thought.<p>

This topic generated many responses, too many to list here.  It's not
a simple issue to be sure.<p>
</b>
<i>
<HR>
ITEM: <b>Mid-Level Instruments.</b><p>

DESCRIPTION: There are not enough mid-level magical instruments for bards.<p>
</i>
<b>
Good item.
</b>
<i>
<HR>
ITEM: <b>Brusco's Bombastic Bellow.</b><p>

DESCRIPTION: This 55th level song does about 222 points of direct damage,
and has a recast time of five minutes. Perhaps the recast time could
be lowered.<p>
</i>
<b>
Bards have a difficult time with song slots.  A bard, in essense, has
to have all combat songs mem'd as well as all buff songs mem'd, whereas
a caster needs combat songs only.  This song takes up a slot.  Some other
song thus has to be removed in order to use it.  From that persepctive
is how it should be balanced.<p>

This song also suffers from the flat bard damage <a
href="http://www.afterlifeguild.org/Thott/powercurves.html">power
curves</a>.  Note that 222 damage in 5 minutes comes out to .74
damage/sec, which is insignificant.<p>

If it were on a 30 second recast delay it would do damage similar to a
chant.<p>
</b>
<i>
<HR>
ITEM: <b>Travel Song Range.</b><p>

DESCRIPTION: The range on some of these songs was increased recently. But
it might be a good idea to raise the range even further. Also, folks would
like Shauri's Sonorous Clouding to have a 4 tick duration like levitate,
as well as a larger range.<p>
</i>
<b>
Shauri's range is so short that if I travel through a city with someone
using /follow, they will never get hit by the song.  However, bigger
is not always better, sometimes I need to invis and don't want it to
hit the group (if the group has pet casters for example).  A better
solution to this and other range issues would be to have some new
commands:<p>

/sing soft<br>
/sing normal<br>
/sing loud<p>

Where soft = 1/3 range and loud = 3x range.<p>

Song of Travel should really have range equal to 10000.  The EQ engine
is such that players can warp and disappear very easily.  Still, I can
usually make it from point A to point B with most of my group alive.
I've only had 8 people die from the use of this song (some twisted
inner child makes me keep track).<p>
</b>
<i>
<HR>
ITEM: <b>Casting Animations on New Songs.</b><p>

DESCRIPTION: It seems that some of the new songs have casting animations
attached to them, not singing animations. It would be nice if to have
song animations on all songs.<p>

NOTE: Songs affected include, but are not restricted to: Chants line
30/38/46, Nivs level 47, Shield of Song 49, Selos song of travel 51,
and I perhaps the 55th level cantana.<p>
</i>
<b>
Hey, I like the casting animations.  In any event, this isn't a balance
issue.<p>
</b>
<i>
<HR>
ITEM: <b>Psalms of Purity (29) and Vitality (37).</b><p>

DESCRIPTION: IF these two songs are supposed to cure poison and/or
disease eventually (after much singing), they do not. If they should,
then let's look into this as a bug.<p>
</i>
<b>
Originally these were supposed to take off one poison/disease counter per
tick, but the code didn't work.  This was the same code that didn't work
in celestial elixir.  The current solution doesn't work either.<p>

It's a bug, not really a balance issue, unless someone maintains that
it isn't a bug.<p>
</b>
<i>
<HR>
ITEM: <b>Song Stacking.</b><p>

DESCRIPTION: Cantana (of Replenishment - 34 and Soothing - 55) and Clarity
(and Harvest) will stack, sort of. If the target has the effects of a
Cantana on him and someone tries to cast a Clarity (or Harvest) spell on
the target, the Clarity (or Harvest) will not stick. But if the Clarity
spell is on a target, the bard Cantana will take effect just fine. The
Cantana(s) also have the same problem with regeneration-type spells. This
appears to be a bug.<p>
</i>
<b>
The clarity problem exists because the second effect of cantana is mana
regen, which is the same as the second effect of clarity.<p>

The regen problem exists because the first effect of cantana is hp
regen, which is the same as the first effect of the regrowth line.<p>

There are two easy fixes:<p>

1) Move the cantana effects to different slots.  If mana regen isn't in
slot 2, then clarity will go up with cantana going.  The same is true if
regen isn't in slot 1.<br>
2) Have any spell overwrite any other spell with a duration of 3 (ticks)
or less.  This way clarity would overwrite cantana, and next tick cantana
would pop back up.  I recommend not going this way, for other reasons
I don't want to discuss in any public medium.<p>

The harder, but best, fix is to have all spells stack with all songs,
the way all songs stack with all spells.  The problem here is I'm not
sure all the info necessary is stored as part of the buff.  I'd be happy
to discuss this problem in depth with a programmer.
<p>
</b>
<i>
<HR>
ITEM: <b>Particle Effects for Songs.</b><p>

DESCRIPTION: It would be nice to be able to turn on and off song effects
as a separate toggle.<p>
</i>
<b>
I think there were some plans to do this and more with particle display
selection.  In any event, it's not a balance issue.<p>
</b>
<i>
<HR>
ITEM: <b>Mesmerization and Fear Song Stacking.</b><p>

DESCRIPTION: It seems that bard mez songs, as short lived as they are,
overwrite all enchanter mesmerization spells. It seems as though they
should not take affect over any other mez spells. The same thing applies
to bardic fear songs, they probably should not overwrite fear spells,
and should probably be overwritten by them.<p>
</i>
<b>
Longer mes effects should overwrite shorter ones.<p>
</b>
<i>
<HR>
ITEM: <b>Cinda's Charismatic Carillon.</b><p>

DESCRIPTION: It seems that wind instruments do not improve the power
of this song over just singing it. A player mentioned that this song
seems to be increased by stringed instruments. Perhaps this one is just
labeled wrong as needing wind instruments, and should just be changed
to be labeled as using string.<p>
</i>
<b>
Another bug.<p>
</b>
<i>
<HR>
ITEM: <b>Fufil's Curtailing Chant.</b><p>

DESCRIPTION: It seems that this song doesn't really reduce damage and
resists at a level on par with the others of its line.<p>
</i>
<b>
Damage spells, as levels increase, increase in power at greater than
a linear level.  So do bard songs.  So the 30 chant is weaker than the
38 chant.  The 46 chant for some reason is identical to the 38 chant.
Having lower level ones weaker at first is fine, but bard songs are
supposed to grow with the bard.  That's why there aren't replacement
chant songs out there.  The problem is, from the level the song is given,
it can only increase linearly, not quadratically like other spells.
<p>
The spell system needs a damage increase formula that increases
quadratically, not linearly, for bard damage songs.
<p>
This is better explained in <a
href="http://www.afterlifeguild.org/Thott/powercurves.html">Bard Power
Curves</a>.
<p>
</b>
<i>
<HR>
ITEM: <b>Song Icons.</b><p>

DESCRIPTION: For everyone but the bard, bardic song effect icons are
constantly blinking. It would probably be better just to have them remain
solid, it's less bothersome.<p>
</i>
<b>
I think it was meant to be if caster = bard, don't blink, but it ended
up being if viewer = bard, don't blink.  No spells blink for a bard,
not bard songs, not buffs, not anything.<p>

Not really a balance issue, but annoying for everyone.<p>
</b>
<i>
<HR>
ITEM: <b>Instrument Building Skill.</b><p>

DESCRIPTION: It sure would be great if there was a skill for making
instruments, including 'cultural' instruments.<p>
</i>
<b>
This was removed in beta, but no reason it couldn't go back in, similar
to tinkering and alchemy.  This could even be a kind of balance issue.<p>

This could also solve the mid-level instrument problem.<p>
</b>
<i>
<HR>
ITEM: <b>Bard NPCs are wimps.</b><p>

DESCRIPTION: It would be nice if NPC bards at least sang their songs when

<b>
What?!?  And deny everyone easy xp?<p>
</b>
<i>
<HR>
ITEM: <b>Firiona Vie Trainer for Bards.</b><p>

DESCRIPTION: There is no bard trainer in Firiona Vie.<p>
</i>

There are no instruments for sale in FV either.  Instead, there are

ITEM: <b>Temple of Solusek Ro weapon quest.</b><p>

DESCRIPTION: One of the bard quest NPCs says something about checking back
later for information on a special bard weapon. Since this has been his
speech for over a year, we should either add this quest or just remove
the text.<p>
</i>
<b>
Not a balance issue, but it should probably be removed.<p>

ITEM: <b>Lute of the Howler.</b><p>

DESCRIPTION: Perhaps there is a story reason for giving bards the ability
to turn into werewolves. But we should be very careful when we give the
more class defining abilities to other classes. The ability to look like
a werewolf is the signature illusion for enchanters. Even if we don't
remove this lute, we most certainly should think twice before giving
such abilities to classes in the future.<p>

The lute isn't NO DROP, it should show up on twinks soon.

Fehren replied:<br>

Forget the werewolf lute, I could care less. It is a toy.
<p>
Other forms except for DE tend to bounce around too much anyway, and
when trying to concentrate on twisting songs and/or switching weapons
to instruments it just complicates things.
<p>
Get the post-50 strength issues in place and forget the toys. In fighting
against Klandicar I'm reduced pretty much to a mana battery for Team
Cleric, as most have very high MR already. Damage songs? I don't waste
time with them anymore and as far as charm and mez at guild evets? -
Phhhhht...

Mana Barderry, without a fix that is what it will come to.

I wish this wasn't on the list. This is like 1/1000000000000th of my
total concerns about the Bard class. They can take it away from me,
I'd be ticked to lose the buff, I could care less about the werewolf
form. They can let me keep it, it won't make me go "yippee, the class
is balanced now".<p>

ITEM: <b>Spell Gems.</b><p>

DESCRIPTION: It would be great if spell gems just turned gray rather
than blanking out when in use. This would allow bards to see what songs
they have running at any given time.<p>

Not a balance issue, or even a problem for most bards.<p>

ITEM: <b>Hit Points.</b><p>

DESCRIPTION: Bards seem to have caster hit points, lower than any hybrid.<p>
</i>
<b>
Bards have hp equal to rogues and monks.  Bards aren't hybrids, but if
they were, they would be rogue/enchanters.  Rogue level hp is reasonable.
In practice, bards have fewer hp than rogues, due to different item
goals.<p>

The #1, overwhelming balance issue is bard usefulness on raids.  I personally
spend roughly 2/3 of my time raiding, and the other 1/3 I spent levelling.
Class balance in a six person group is of no importance to me, or others
like me.  I am not alone in this situation.
<p>
It used to be that large raids were done rarely by most, and frequently
by very few, but times are changing.  Instead of one raid guild per server,
there are now many raid guilds, in three seperate tiers, killing different
mobs.  The guilds are now larger than ever, and the trend is towards guilds
that are larger still.  Most of these people are not level 60.
<p>
Raid balance IS important, and should be addressed.  Solo and six person
group balance has been hammered a great deal over time, but raid
balance has been mostly ignored.
<p>
On raids it's the group oriented classes that are the best, with one
one exception: bards.  Bards are the most group oriented class of all,
yet are also the worst class on raids.
<p>
Most bard abilities either don't work, don't stack properly (haste), or
just aren't useful.  Even the somewhat useful ones are all limited
to the current group only.  It's this group only limitation that makes
bards so weak compared to other party enhancement classes (enchanters,
shamans).
<p>
Tests have shown that resists over 175 make little difference.  Getting
to 175 with equipment is trivial.  Even getting to 255 with equipment
is not impossible.  As more and more equipment comes into the game, and
its quality is better and better, the argument that "bards are good for
resists" becomes less and less valid.  The point where the argument
became invalid happened over a year ago.
<p>
Even back when bards WERE good for resists, in the very early vox/nagafen
runs, when nobody had any resist gear at all, a cleric could help more.
There simply weren't enough clerics then (there often are now) to put
two clerics in every group.  Class balance should not be based on the
lack of a better class.
<p>
For a long time the #1 thing a bard could do is give +atk to his group
through the 57 song McVaxius` Rousing Rondo (+14 attack, more with SSS).
Yet with Velious, rangers can now add 40 attack to everyone in their
group, <i>and every other group</i>.  So rangers are adding more than
bards ever did, and are doing it to more people, yet they are far more
damaging.  Hopefully this makes the problem clear.
<p>
To compete with this, bards would have to add enough attack to equal
what a ranger is giving, which is 40atk times 6 groups or so, which
would mean a bard atk song would need to give 240 attack.  What's more,
the song would need to give additional attack to make up for the low
melee damage of a bard vs a ranger.  If a song gave enough atk to make
a bard viable in a raid situation, it would make the class far too
powerful in a 6 person group situation.
<p>
There are many suggestions out there to improve bards in raid situations,
but most of them also improve bards in six person groups and when solo.
In non-raid situations, bards are fine.  They don't need a big power
boost.  But on raids, bards need a massive power boost, and need it
1.5 years ago.
<p>
Bards have been suffering on raids for a very long time.  Now is when it
needs to be fixed.
<p>
The best solution in my mind is to have bard haste stack, which all
logic and history says it should stack, and have it go past the cap.
However every time the idea that it should go past the cap is brought
up, people immediately say no, it would be too powerful.  Powerful
how?  Read <a href="http://www.afterlifeguild.org/Thott/haste_stacking.html">
Haste Stacking</a>.  It clearly explains how "powerful" haste stacking
would be.  
<p>
Consider that a bard would then be able to add 45% haste to
only the few melees in his group, compared to an enchanter that can add
66% haste to EVERYONE on a raid, and it's obvious there is no way this
could be unbalancing for bards.
<p>
Haste stacking is not the only solution, it's just good because it fits
in with how bards work and it only helps bards in raid environments.  Other
suggestions include a party buff that reduces all damage done by some
percentage, similar to the defensive discipline.  In effect this would
be a slow that isn't resistable.  Others suggest that bards simply need
to do more melee damage, which currently, with bards being very limited
in what they can do outside of melee, is the simple and direct answer.
<p>
The future of bards is now.  The time for classes to be frozen is at hand.
If bards are unchanged they will continue to be the worst raid class.
Poor raid performace means the class has no future, for there is nothing
to do once someone hits max level besides do raids.  Who wants to play
a class with no future?
<p>

I would like to add that one of the ways in which we USED to be useful
on raids was to give mana regen to casters who had to do massive group
buffing or rezzing. But the Enchanter and Cleric epic weapons have
wrecked this one feeble contribution as well. The only time anyone even
makes the effort to swap a Bard into a different group now is when the
lone Necro has to summon 30 corpses.<p>
</i>
Which is a very good point. Note that the new Velious necro robe has
the conjure corpse spell on it, so even that use no longer exists.

In response to the labelling of some items as bugs and not balance
issues, Baerd responded:<br>
<i>
I see no point in telling Verant which items are balance issues and
which are bugs. Semantics don't matter, we need all those issues
addressed. Balance issues are obviously more important than a drum
graphic, granted, but I trust Verant enough to figure out which issues
fall under which categories.<p>
</i>
Which led Rigadoon deMortis to reply with:<br>
<i>
I can almost see the upcoming bard balance patch message.

***************************************
Do to overwhelming balance problems with
the bard class, the dev team has worked 
hard to take on these key balance issues.

1) Stop Song / Start Song should work appropriately

2) Drum animations are now in!

3) Additionally a new drum graphics was added!

4) Druid regens will now stack without bards having
to stop the song

5) A bug was fixed with charismatic carrilon!

Oh, and ya'll who said throw in everything including the
toilet.. congratulations you got the toilet you asked for.<p>
</i>
Which is a good point, if sarcastically applied. The main reason
though is that right now, we need to get the balance issues settled,
and bugs distract from this.  If all bard bugs are fixed, then the
bard class will have to receive more attention than all other classes
combined, due to the large backlog of bugs.  If bards get that much
attention, will there really be more attention given to fixing real
balance issues?  I think not.
<p>
So I flag the items that are bugs, as bugs.  They can be worked on
later.
