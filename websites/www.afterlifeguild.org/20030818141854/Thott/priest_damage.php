These sims depict the damage per second a priest can pump out in
pure-damage mode.&nbsp; These simulated priests aren't healing at
all.&nbsp; They do nothing but cast their DoT's, cast their nukes,
self torpor/cannibalize (shamans only) or meditate.&nbsp; The results
are graphed.
<p>
Note that cleric damage isn't accurate, because I have no good numbers
for cleric melee damage with the new proc hammers.&nbsp; These graphs
only show cleric nuke damage.
<p>
Also note that shaman DoT's are used, and shaman DoT's are taunting.&nbsp;
It takes a high quality crazy glue warrior to prevent the shaman
from becoming the tank when using these DoT's, so this damage isn't
particularly realistic.&nbsp; That said, it looks like (from analyzing
spdat modifications) shaman DoT's in PoP will be significantly less
taunting than current versions.&nbsp; In particular they do not have an
initial hit, nor do they have very many poison/disease counters, both
of which are major factors in DoT taunt.&nbsp; Shamans may very well be
able to pump out high damage per second in PoP without gaining aggro,
but we'll have to see.
<p>
Rain spells are graphed, but since they can't be used in every situation,
they're simulated seperately from non-rain damage.&nbsp; Not everyone
has their ancient nuke/DoT, so that too is simulated seperately.
<p>
<table border=1><tr><td>
<center><div class=menutitle>Update 10/19/02</div></center>
<b>Clarifications</b>: All DD damage, by druids and clerics, is increased
by 10% from focus items and 7% from crits (Spell Casting Fury 3).&nbsp;
This was originally part of the sims, but wasn't mentioned anywhere.&nbsp;
Oddly enough, the supposed lack of the 7% damage increase from crits was
one of the primary shaman objections, even though it would be trivial to
look at the graphs and mentally adjust them up 7% (don't do it though,
as I said, it's already included).
<p>
The actual calculation is to multiply by 1.1, then multiply by
1.07...which actually results in a slightly higher number than what's
currently live, because the way these things are calculated was
changed.&nbsp; But it's pretty close.
<p>
These damage calculations lack these features, that I can think of off
the top of my head:
<ul>
<li>Melee haste (shaman)
<li>Pet (shaman primarily, druids to a lesser extent, cleric pet takes mana and is more of a nuke/DoT)
<li>Druid epic (I should really add this, but I forgot to)
<li>Damage shields (hard to quantify, but it definitely adds damage to druids)
<li>Cleric melee (I have no numbers for this)
</ul>
And probably some other things.&nbsp; Shamans also objected about the
missing items above, except that oddly enough, no shaman objected that
their pet was not included.&nbsp; Shaman pets, from the last time I
parsed one, do about 10 dps.&nbsp; However, due perhaps to leash laws,
shamans rarely use them.
<p>
<center><div class="menutitle">Additions 10/19/02</div></center>
I've added another sim to the list, the short damage (fights less than 1
minute) sim.&nbsp; This cuts out any DoT's longer than 60 seconds, i.e.,
Pox.&nbsp; When doing this, I noticed that the sim shaman was using up
all his mana on Ice Blast instead of keeping the more effecient DoT's
active, so I changed the script so he would only Ice Blast only if he
had excessive mana, and damage/sec went up.&nbsp; That's the problem with
simulated shaman, they aren't very bright.&nbsp; I said <i>simulated</i>
shaman!&nbsp; No flames please.
<p>
I updated the original sim the same way (smarter shaman).
<p>
These sims don't count resists, but neither do they count resist
debuffs.
<p>
<center><div class="menutitle">Corrections 10/21/02</div></center>
Sim shaman was using his epic in the fast damage simulation, even though
he shouldn't have.&nbsp; I took it away, and sent him to his sim room.
<p>
<center><div class="menutitle">Additions 10/21/02</div></center>
Added a 'nukes only' simulation.&nbsp; As the name suggests, this compares
the classes in situations where the only damage spells they use are nukes
(Moonfire, Ice Strike, and Judgement).
<p>
<center><div class="menutitle">Comments 10/30/02</div></center>
The DoT simulations assume that the shaman casts a new DoT every time the
old one wears off, but in real situations, it may be possible to cast the
same DoT again early (if a second mob joins the fight), or it may not be
possible to cast it when it expires (because the mob is near death, and no
new mob has arrived).
<p>
What this means is that the first few minutes show maximum damage/sec,
but only if fighting one target the whole time.&nbsp; In some situations
it won't be accurate.&nbsp; The 20 minute value is accurate for one mob
or multiple mobs, since the real priest can cast just as many DoT's as the
simulated priest - he just isn't likely to cast them in exactly the same
order, at exactly the same times.&nbsp; The real priest can also avoid
the aggro generated by the simulated priest, by not casting all the
DoT's on one target.
<p>
Depending on the situation, it may not be possible to use all the
DoT's the simulation shows, in which case some mix between the all-DoT
simulation and the all-nuking simulation is closer to reality.
<p>
For example, shaman DoT's can be particularly taunting, so in a group
where there is no strong tank, a shaman trying to do primarily damage
will likely cast one or zero DoT's per mob, and mostly nuke.&nbsp;
In this situation, it's the nuking-only sim that makes sense.
<p>
<center><div class="menutitle">Changes 10/31/02</div></center>
Congratulatate sim druid, today he completed his epic!
<p>
Sim druid now uses his epic in all damage sims except nuke-only.&nbsp; In the one
minute fight sim, the epic effect lasts only one minute.

<h3>Commentary</h3>
Nothing surprising here.&nbsp; Or rather, it's surprising, but we already
knew that shaman mana regeneration is significantly higher than that for
any other priest, so it's expected that they dominate the graphs in long
term damage.&nbsp; The quantity of damage is, however, quite surprising:
shamans can exceed 100dps sustained for long periods of time, even with
only (FT+MC)8 and no mana regen buffs of any kind.
<p>
Note that 100% fighting is not possible in the real world (I enjoy using
the phrase 'real world' to describe a game - I don't know why).&nbsp; In
practice, there is time lost while mobs are being pulled, during buffing,
etc.&nbsp; That time translates into higher real dps for casters relative
to melees.&nbsp; At the same time, the above graphs assume zero resists,
and in practice, resists happen.&nbsp; Thus it's hard to use any graphs
showing caster dps in a meaningful way when comparing to melee damage.
<p>
In situations where there is some downtime, the shaman advantage grows,
because shaman mana regeneration is directly proportional to how much time
a shaman has to cast cannibalize IV and torpor.&nbsp; It's the conflict
between the cast time of mana regeneration spells and the cast time
of damage/healing spells that led me to create simulations instead of
attempting to calculate mana regen and multiply it by effeciency.&nbsp;
The actual values in are necessarily different, because the more
heals/DoT's casted, the less time there is to cannibalize.
