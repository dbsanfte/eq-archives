1. Carefully read over the requirements found at<br>
&lt;a href="http://www.afterlifeguild.org/?page=joining"&gt;<br>
http://www.afterlifeguild.org/?page=joining&lt;/a&gt;. &nbsp;If you do not meet all<br>
of the level, item, skill, and other requirements, please list which ones,<br>
why, and in what timeframe you expect to achieve them. &nbsp;If you have any<br>
questions about the requirements, email recruiter@afterlifeguild.org<br>
and ask before submitting this application.<br>
<br>
I don't have e-mail ya bastard<br>
<br>
2. Has an Afterlife member agreed to sponsor you? If so, who? If more<br>
than one person agreed to sponsor you, list them all. &nbsp;Your sponsor<br>
should be someone who can answer any questions you have about the way<br>
Afterlife operates. &nbsp;Your sponsor is also someone who will vouch for you<br>
as a good recruit.<br>
<br>
aaaahh...they're all just a mirage<br>
<br>
I have a special kinship with Hobben though, it's a water thing.<br>
<br>
3. Which Afterlife members have you grouped with, and what did you do<br>
while grouped? &nbsp;What was the group/raid's mission, and what was your<br>
role?<br>
<br>
byddon, I rooted him & nuked him to death from the other side of a sand dune. He never figured out where it was coming from.<br>
<br>
4a. List all your 55+ characters (name/class/level/race). &nbsp;Only list<br>

plan on guilding should your application be accepted.<br>

<br>
5a. List your raiding experiences. &nbsp;Where and what have you killed while<br>
on raids?<br>
<br>
I have nuked every member of Afterlife on & off over the past year or so. Byddon is the only one I was able to kill, although my cousin (bixie) was able to kill off one of you.<br>
<br>
5b. &nbsp;Describe a time when you and your group or raid wiped out. &nbsp;Analyze<br>
what happened. &nbsp;What was your role in picking up the pieces?<br>
<br>
One time 3 of us spawned & before we could split & head to the dock Team manaburn showed up & AE'd us. My role was to respawn & exact revenge by hiding under the dock & nuking while still being out of range of players even though my spells all landed.<br>
<br>
5c. &nbsp;Describe a time when you and your group or raid succeeded. &nbsp;Analyze<br>
what went right. &nbsp;What was your role in the success?<br>
<br>
The one time I killed Byddon, Waihung had just ran past & winked at him, I think Byddon was mesmerized and unable to cast on me.<br>
<br>
6. List all the guilds you've been in and why you left them. &nbsp;If you are<br>
currently guilded, why do you wish to leave them?<br>
(Guild/dates/levels/reason for leaving)<br>

<br>
LoTD, taught them their raid tactics, they didn't last<br>

<br>
8. Describe what Afterlife and you can do for each other.<br>

<br>
8b. &nbsp;What would you bring to Afterlife? &nbsp;What distinguishes you from all<br>
of the other applicants?<br>

within EverQuest?<br>

leadership -- some aspect of running a raid, or perhaps a guild conflict<br>
handled while an officer. &nbsp;Give a play by play of how you handled the<br>
situation. &nbsp;Explain what you did and why you did it. &nbsp;What mistakes did<br>
you make? &nbsp;What would you do differently now? &nbsp;What did you learn?<br>
<br>
I had to gate once due to a conflict with Thott, I'll explain later.<br>
<br>
10. If you were given 30 seconds to teach a newbie how to play your<br>
primary character, what would you say to that person? What is the most<br>
critical element of your game play? &nbsp;This isn't a trick question; we<br>
know you wouldn't let someone else play your account, and we know you<br>
couldn't teach them to play as well as you do. &nbsp;We want to know how well<br>
you can convey the basics of your class.<br>
<br>
1) follow hobben<br>
2) don't forget to chain cast root on everything, don't &nbsp; worry its not interruptable<br>
3) always spam tag line<br>
4) remember, you can land spells even out of LoS, don't believe what the PC's tell you, it isn't fixed.<br>
<br>

hours? &nbsp;Please distinguish between your weekday and weekend schedule.<br>

<br>
24/7<br>
<br>
15. How many days do you have played on your primary character? &nbsp;If you<br>
have more days played on another character, how many days do you have<br>
played on it, and what class/level is it?<br>
<br>
around 800<br>
<br>
16a. &nbsp;What is your best EverQuest memory/experience ever? &nbsp;This doesn't<br>
have to be raid related, although it may be.<br>
<br>
I once stunned Thott as he ran past me at mach 5, I had to gate though because he tried to tash me with some stick.<br>
<br>
16b. &nbsp;What is your worst EverQuest memory/experience ever? &nbsp;This also<br>
doesn't have to be raid related, although it may be.<br>
