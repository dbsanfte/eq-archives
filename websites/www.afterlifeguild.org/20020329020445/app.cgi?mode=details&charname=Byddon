<h4>Application</h4>
<table border=0>
<tr><td>
1. Carefully read over the requirements found at<br>
&lt;a href="http://www.afterlifeguild.org/?page=joining"&gt;<br>
http://www.afterlifeguild.org/?page=joining&lt;/a&gt;. &nbsp;If you do not meet all<br>
of the level, item, skill, and other requirements, please list which ones,<br>
why, and in what timeframe you expect to achieve them. &nbsp;If you have any<br>
questions about the requirements, email recruiter@afterlifeguild.org<br>
and ask before submitting this application.<br>
<br>
Only requirement I lack is mass buff, and I'll have that as soon as Jenamdar lets me into his exp group....so likely never.<br>
<br>
2. Has an Afterlife member agreed to sponsor you? If so, who? If more<br>
than one person agreed to sponsor you, list them all. &nbsp;Your sponsor<br>
should be someone who can answer any questions you have about the way<br>
Afterlife operates. &nbsp;Your sponsor is also someone who will vouch for you<br>
as a good recruit.<br>
<br>
No one wants to sponsor me.....however I think Xarn will if I give into his demands :/<br>
<br>
3. Which Afterlife members have you grouped with, and what did you do<br>
while grouped? &nbsp;What was the group/raid's mission, and what was your<br>
role?<br>
<br>
Well I have not really grouped with many AL members, but I have GGed all of them many times.<br>
<br>
4a. List all your 55+ characters (name/class/level/race). &nbsp;Only list<br>
characters to which you have exclusive access.<br>
<br>
Hmm I have no chars I have exclusive access to. Seems everyone wants a piece of my druid, and lot of ppl line up to play Jen on raids.<br>
<br>
4b. List all your characters of the 20th level or higher whom you would<br>
plan on guilding should your application be accepted.<br>
<br>
Jenamdar<br>
Byddon<br>
Saelia<br>
Jendon<br>
Nalen<br>
<br>
<br>
5a. List your raiding experiences. &nbsp;Where and what have you killed while<br>
on raids?<br>
<br>
Well I have not exactly "killed" anything on raids, but every mob pre-luclin that had DT has killed me.<br>
<br>
5b. &nbsp;Describe a time when you and your group or raid wiped out. &nbsp;Analyze<br>
what happened. &nbsp;What was your role in picking up the pieces?<br>
<br>
I was sitting in pog chatting up Tunare while my raid was out clearing mobs. See I dont like violence so I was out "harming mobs" for pullers. In reality was just trying to score with Tunare...anyway some bard pulled Tunare and most of the zone showed up and ate the raid. At that point I dragged most of the dead to the waterfall and watched them res in and get killed over and over for about an hour.<br>
<br>
5c. &nbsp;Describe a time when you and your group or raid succeeded. &nbsp;Analyze<br>
what went right. &nbsp;What was your role in the success?<br>
<br>
I was part of many CT raids that were quite well, could not have killed him without me taking those DTs. BYDDON!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
6. List all the guilds you've been in and why you left them. &nbsp;If you are<br>
currently guilded, why do you wish to leave them?<br>
(Guild/dates/levels/reason for leaving)<br>
<br>
I have only been in 1 guild, which I do not care to name here. But I am eager to leave them, they are a bunch of stuckup bastards who get me killed and dont give me loot.<br>
<br>
7. List any problems you've had with Afterlife or its members. &nbsp;List the<br>
member's name and explain the situation.<br>
<br>
No comment on this one, on the grounds it may prevent me from getting in.<br>
<br>
8. Describe what Afterlife and you can do for each other.<br>
<br>
I can GG and AL can give me lewts. As a bonus I cast a mean potg and have been known to eat a DT or 2.<br>
<br>
8a. &nbsp;Why are you applying? &nbsp;What do you want to get out of joining<br>
Afterlife?<br>
<br>
I am applying because joining AL is the peak of EQ. Once I join it means I can finally quit this damn game.<br>
<br>
8b. &nbsp;What would you bring to Afterlife? &nbsp;What distinguishes you from all<br>
of the other applicants?<br>
<br>
I am the oldest active gatebot on MM, enough said.<br>
<br>
9a. &nbsp;What positions of leadership have you held, formally or informally,<br>
within EverQuest?<br>
<br>
I led about 1000 people from ej evac point to seb bubble...<br>
<br>
9b. &nbsp;Think of a specific instance in which you had to exercise<br>
leadership -- some aspect of running a raid, or perhaps a guild conflict<br>
handled while an officer. &nbsp;Give a play by play of how you handled the<br>
situation. &nbsp;Explain what you did and why you did it. &nbsp;What mistakes did<br>
you make? &nbsp;What would you do differently now? &nbsp;What did you learn?<br>
<br>
I have tried to be a leader, but no one takes me seriously :/ I can;t for the life of me understand why.<br>
<br>
10. If you were given 30 seconds to teach a newbie how to play your<br>
primary character, what would you say to that person? What is the most<br>
critical element of your game play? &nbsp;This isn't a trick question; we<br>
know you wouldn't let someone else play your account, and we know you<br>
couldn't teach them to play as well as you do. &nbsp;We want to know how well<br>
you can convey the basics of your class.<br>
<br>
Thats easy, always mem invs, self gate and sow!. GGing ppl around can be a dangerous task, always be prepaired.<br>
<br>
11. If you aren't level 60 yet, why not? &nbsp;In what timeframe do you<br>
expect to reach 60?<br>
<br>
I hit 60 everytime I'm ressed.<br>
<br>
12. Do you have your epic weapon? If not, why not?<br>
<br>
I asked for an epic for x-mas, but Jen said no. I'm still working on it tho, someday he will give in I think.<br>
<br>
13. What connection (modem, dsl, cable, ect) and hardware (CPU, RAM,<br>
video card)do you use? Do you have any trouble staying connected and<br>
moving with 50+ players on your screen?<br>
<br>
Cable-Ath 1.1, 512 ram, GF2. 50+ corpes doesnt lag me at all.<br>
<br>
14. How many days a week do you play, and what are your normal playing<br>
hours? &nbsp;Please distinguish between your weekday and weekend schedule.<br>
Is your raid availability the same as your play time? &nbsp;If not, please<br>
elaborate.<br>
<br>
Well byddon seems to almost always be online......<br>
<br>
15. How many days do you have played on your primary character? &nbsp;If you<br>
have more days played on another character, how many days do you have<br>
played on it, and what class/level is it?<br>
<br>
180 days on byddon<br>
270 on my 60 shaman<br>
50 on my 54 necro<br>
10 on my 52 monk<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
16a. &nbsp;What is your best EverQuest memory/experience ever? &nbsp;This doesn't<br>
have to be raid related, although it may be.<br>
<br>
I got to gg AL around after they cleared VP for the first time, best night of my life.<br>
<br>
16b. &nbsp;What is your worst EverQuest memory/experience ever? &nbsp;This also<br>
doesn't have to be raid related, although it may be.<br>
<br>
Having Neeffo nuke me to death at the misty ring, little bastard never has given me a rematch.<br>
<br>
17. &nbsp;Rate yourself from 1 to 5 on the following attributes, 1 being<br>
sub-par, 5 being excellent. &nbsp;Give a ONE LINE elaboration on each. &nbsp;If<br>
you give yourself fives across the board, I expect you to back it up.<br>
&lt;p&gt;<br>
17a. &nbsp;Personality: How well do you get along with other people?<br>
<br>
5 people love the peck<br>
<br>
17b. &nbsp;Class Knowledge: How well do you know your class?<br>
<br>
5 I can GG anywhere.<br>
<br>
17c. &nbsp;General EQ knowledge: How much do you know about the game?<br>
<br>
2 I usually get left behind on actual fights.<br>
<br>
17d. &nbsp;Raid Knowledge: How well do you understand raids?<br>
<br>
5 I've gated people to every raid in EQ.<br>
<br>
17e. &nbsp;Learning Curve: How quickly do you absorb new ideas?<br>
<br>
3 I learned pretty fast how to double invs to make quest armor I didnt really earn.<br>
<br>
17f. &nbsp;Initiative/Leadership: Are you a self-starter? &nbsp;Can you motivate<br>
others?<br>
<br>
1 No one takes druids seriously anyway.<br>
<br>
18. The character with which you apply will be the character you are<br>
expected to bring to raids. &nbsp;You will only have one main character in<br>
the eyes of Afterlife. &nbsp;Do you understand and agree to this?<br>
<br>
Yep, druid will be my main. Im sure AL will keep to its rules and not let me change my main to my shaman...<br>
<br>
19. What Alternate Advancement abilities have you purchased?<br>
<br>
None, but Jen tells me I will earn run 1 someday. I do try to KS as many kills as I can from him, but it makes for slow progress. Damn shaman need to be nerfed.<br>
<br>
20. &nbsp;Now that you've filled out this application, put it away for a<br>
day. &nbsp;Read your responses again. &nbsp;Do they still ring true? &nbsp;Do you have<br>
any questions you want to ask me before returning the application? &nbsp;Make<br>
changes as necessary.<br>
