  <a name="gen"></a><b>General Lotto Rules</b></font> </div>
<h4 align="center">&nbsp;</h4>
<p> <font size="-1">These rules apply to any items that drop that aren't covered 
  by the <a href="/?page=dkp"><font color="#000066">DKP system</font></a>. </font>
<p><font size="-1"><b>Background</b></font> <br>
  <font size="-1">There are two different philosophies when it comes to doing 
  lottos, and both are equally valid. &nbsp;The first is that everyone present 
  when an item drop is equally entitled to it, as each person there put forth 
  the same time and risk. &nbsp;This is one way of doing lottos, and it is completely 
  valid. &nbsp;This is not, however, the way lottos are done in Afterlife. </font>
<p><font size="-1"> The other way of doing lottos is to give each item to the 
  person that can best use it. &nbsp;This is the most efficient use of resources, 
  results in the fewest "bad lottos," and this is the system we use. <br>
  <br>
  </font><b><font size="-1">General Application</font></b><font size="-1"><br>
  Designated character Time spent camping Can vs. Will use. </font><font size="-1">The 
  general philosophy is that the character that can best use the item gets the 
  item. </font>
<p><font size="-1"> When armor drops, the people that can use the item can enter 
  in for it, and no others. &nbsp;If one person can benefit more from it than 
  the other people present, then that is the person that should get it. </font>
<p><font size="-1"> For example, say a weapon drops that warriors can use, and 
  there are two warriors present. &nbsp;If one warrior has a weapon of nearly 
  the same power, and another warrior does not, the second warrior should get 
  the item. &nbsp;The item is of more use to him, and giving him the item is a 
  better use of its power than giving it to the first warrior, to whom it may 
  be an insignificant upgrade, or soon become bank trash. </font>
<p><font size="-1"><b>Multiple characters/one player</b> <br>
  Any character under level 46 is considered a "twink", any character level 46 
  or above is a real character. &nbsp;Real characters always come before twinks. 
  </font>
<p><font size="-1"> If a player with more than one real character is camping in 
  an area that has items that more than one of his characters can use, he must 
  specify before an item drops which character he will enter the lotto as, otherwise 
  the currently played character is assumed. </font>
<p><font size="-1"> This means that if a player with a 46+ warrior and cleric 
  is camping something with an Afterlife group with his warrior, and a cleric 
  item drops, the warrior/cleric can't enter, because he didn't specify he was 
  there as his cleric beforehand. &nbsp;If, however, the player says beforehand 
  that he is there as his cleric, he can enter for any cleric items, but not for 
  any warrior items. </font>
<p><font size="-1"> If there are no players present with designated real characters 
  that can use an item, then the item is lotto'd amongst any non-designated characters 
  that can use he item. </font>
<p><font size="-1"> For example, say a cleric item drops and the player above 
  with a warrior and a cleric is present as his warrior. &nbsp;If no other warriors 
  are present, then he can enter the lotto as his cleric. </font>
<p><font size="-1"> If there are no real characters, designated or not, that can 
  use the item (use in this case means would actually use it, i.e. if the item 
  would be sold, even if it can be equipped, it won't be used, and thus a player 
  can't enter in for it to the exclusion of others after all As with everything, 
  there are exceptions to this rule. Say a player Because we are not a random 
  collection of people, we can distribute armor in a fair manner, or at least 
  far more fair than a random groups can. &nbsp;To this end we will strive to 
  distribute armor based purely on time invested. &nbsp;It is up to all those 
  of a given class to pay attention, and to <i>know</i> when someone else present 
  has more time invested, and to react accordingly by deferring to the older, 
  in terms of time invested, player. </font>
<p><font size="-1"> In those cases where it can't be determined who has spent 
  the most time, the item will be lotto'd amongst those with equivalent times. 
  </font>
<p><font size="-1"> It is up to every player to notice and remember the time spent 
  by others of the same class. </font>
<p><font size="-1"> Time invested, in every place mentioned above, is time invested 
  per piece of armor gained. &nbsp;If one player has spent more time, but has 
  proportionally more armor, then the two players are equivalent. &nbsp;If two 
  have spent equal time and one has 2 more pieces of armor, the more armored player 
  would stay out of any lottos until both players are equal in armor obtained. 
  </font>
<p><font size="-1"> Note that this isn't total armor the player is wearing, this 
  is total armor obtained in the same time invested. &nbsp;When comparing two 
  players it's quite likely that one had armor before the other started going 
  to planes, in which case the time invested counts from that point on, ignoring 
  original armor. </font>
<p><font size="-1"><b>Completing the Set</b> <br>
  </font><font size="-1">In any case where the time per armor piece is equivalent, 
  and one person has more armor than another, the lesser equipped person should 
  stay out. &nbsp;This is necessary because as a player gets more armor, the chances 
  of finding the remaining pieces becomes smaller and smaller. &nbsp; Note that 
  this is only true when the time invested is equivalent or near equivalent.<br>
  <br>
  </font> 
<div align="left"> 
  <p><font size="-1"><b>Multiple Characters</b></font> <font size="-1"><br>
    If a player has more than one character that gets armor in a plane, they may 
    win items for either character. &nbsp;The same rules apply as above, with 
    armor for both characters counting. </font></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><font size="-1"><a name="pa"></a>Plane Armor</font></h2>
  <p> 
  <p><font size="-1">These rules apply to non-god/dragon items of any kind, but 
    primarily to planar armor. </font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"><b>Background<br>
    </b>If everyone played equally, each item found would be lotto'd and given 
    to someone until everyone present has one item, then any items dropped thereafter 
    would be given in the same order as before. The lotto exists only to determine 
    the initial order, when all those present have the same amount of time invested. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> Unfortunately, not everyone plays equally.&nbsp; Since in 
    random groupings there is no way of knowing who has spent the most time, each 
    new group starts over from scratch doing random lottos for each item. Since 
    people come and go, sometimes every item is lotto'd across everyone present, 
    even including those that won earlier, since the group composition is now 
    different.&nbsp; Afterlife can do better than this.<br>
    <br>
