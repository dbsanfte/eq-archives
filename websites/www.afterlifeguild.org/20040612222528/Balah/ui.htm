<center><b><font size="+3">Hobben's UI</font></b></center>
<br>
<center>Last Updated 02/12/2004<br></center>
<br>
<center>
This is my personal UI that I have made over the last few months. 
Some parts I blatently ripped off from other modders, then customized to my liking.
However most of it I have written myself, to suit my needs.
<br>
<br>
To use this UI, navigate to your drive:/everquest/uifiles directory.<br>
Make a new directory in this folder.<br>
Unzip my UI files into the new directory. For this example I assume you named the directory Hobben.<br>
Go in game and type "/loadskin Hobben 1"<br>

<b>YOU MUST DO A CLEAN INSTALL IF YOU ARE UPGRADING FROM A PREVIOUS VERSION OF MY UI</b><br>
<a href="/Balah/ui/melee.zip"> Melee Version</a><br>
<a href="/Balah/ui/caster.zip">Caster Version</a><br>
Caster Version is mostly the same as the melee UI, but with mana.<br>
<br>
<br>
Optional Target box with Target of Target indicator built in<br>

If you want the UI to look exactly like the screenshots you need to take the following steps.<br>
Last modified 03/12/2004<br>
1. Download and install the melee or caster UI.<br>
2. Set your in game resolution to 1280x1024.<br>
3. Download <a href="/Balah/ui/exact.zip"> THIS</a> file.<br>
4. Unzip the three XML files into your custom directory.<br>
5. Rename UI_name_server.ini to your name and server and copy it to your EQ directory. <br>
For example mine is UI_Hobben_mithanie.ini. <br>
If you are unsure, check your everquest directory for reference.<br>
6. Load up EQ and load my UI.<br>
<br>
A few notes.<br>
- Will only line up correctly if using optional target box<br>
- You will not be able to reposition chat or buff boxes. If you must make a change, i reccomend using /loadsk default 1, making the change, then reloading my UI.<br>
- I use the top left box to hold things i do not want to see. Things like my misses, others misses etc.<br>
- The top right box i use for various chat channels. <br>
- If you have no use for these 2 boxes, simply right click on them and select close.<br>
