This is my personal UI that I have made over the last few months. 
Some parts I blatently ripped off from other modders, then customized to my liking.
However most of it I have written myself, to suit my needs.
<br>
<br>
To use this UI, navigate to your drive:/everquest/uifiles directory.<br>
Make a new directory in this folder.<br>
Unzip my UI files into the new directory. For this example I assume you named the directory Hobben.<br>
Go in game and type "/loadskin Hobben 1"<br>

03/07/2003<br>
Changed around Big Bank<br>
Included my UI's INI file in the zip, if you wish to have your windows positioned the same as mine.
Change the name of UI_Charname_XX.ini, to whatever your chars UI file is named. 
For Example mine is called UI_Hobben_42.ini, if you arent sure check your EQ directory for a reference.
The INI file is designed to run in 1280x1024, once you have changed to the file appropriate name, just copy the file into your EQ folder and start the game. <br>
