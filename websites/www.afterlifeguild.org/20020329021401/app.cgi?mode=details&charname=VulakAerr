<br>
5b. &nbsp;Describe a time when you and your group or raid wiped out. &nbsp;Analyze<br>
what happened. &nbsp;What was your role in picking up the pieces?<br>

(Guild/dates/levels/reason for leaving)<br>

<br>
I think we can make a pretty good raiding team!<br>
<br>
8a. &nbsp;Why are you applying? &nbsp;What do you want to get out of joining<br>
Afterlife?<br>
<br>
I'm tired of AL trying to kill me, so i figure if i can't beat em, I'll join em.<br>
<br>
8b. &nbsp;What would you bring to Afterlife? &nbsp;What distinguishes you from all<br>
of the other applicants?<br>
<br>
I bring phat lewtz, not to mention some mad skills.<br>
<br>
9a. &nbsp;What positions of leadership have you held, formally or informally,<br>
within EverQuest?<br>
<br>
I've been the leader of the Temple of Veeshan.<br>
<br>
9b. &nbsp;Think of a specific instance in which you had to exercise<br>
leadership -- some aspect of running a raid, or perhaps a guild conflict<br>
handled while an officer. &nbsp;Give a play by play of how you handled the<br>
situation. &nbsp;Explain what you did and why you did it. &nbsp;What mistakes did<br>
you make? &nbsp;What would you do differently now? &nbsp;What did you learn?<br>

<br>
10. If you were given 30 seconds to teach a newbie how to play your<br>
primary character, what would you say to that person? What is the most<br>
critical element of your game play? &nbsp;This isn't a trick question; we<br>
know you wouldn't let someone else play your account, and we know you<br>
couldn't teach them to play as well as you do. &nbsp;We want to know how well<br>
you can convey the basics of your class.<br>
<br>
I'd tell them to flurry as much as they can, and lifetap lots, and often.<br>
<br>

expect to reach 60?<br>
<br>
I'm level 70 now.<br>
<br>

<br>
I don't have my epic, because the stuff i got is better than that.<br>
<br>
13. What connection (modem, dsl, cable, ect) and hardware (CPU, RAM,<br>
video card)do you use? Do you have any trouble staying connected and<br>
moving with 50+ players on your screen?<br>
<br>
I run my own isp.<br>
<br>
14. How many days a week do you play, and what are your normal playing<br>
hours? &nbsp;Please distinguish between your weekday and weekend schedule.<br>
Is your raid availability the same as your play time? &nbsp;If not, please<br>
elaborate.<br>
<br>
I play when i'm not dead.<br>
<br>
15. How many days do you have played on your primary character? &nbsp;If you<br>
have more days played on another character, how many days do you have<br>
played on it, and what class/level is it?<br>
<br>
I'm honestly not sure how many days i've had played.<br>
<br>
16a. &nbsp;What is your best EverQuest memory/experience ever? &nbsp;This doesn't<br>
have to be raid related, although it may be.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
16b. &nbsp;What is your worst EverQuest memory/experience ever? &nbsp;This also<br>
doesn't have to be raid related, although it may be.<br>
<br>
Worst memory was the first time Afterlife killed me =(<br>
<br>
17. &nbsp;Rate yourself from 1 to 5 on the following attributes, 1 being<br>
sub-par, 5 being excellent. &nbsp;Give a ONE LINE elaboration on each. &nbsp;If<br>
you give yourself fives across the board, I expect you to back it up.<br>
&lt;p&gt;<br>

<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
17f. &nbsp;Initiative/Leadership: Are you a self-starter? &nbsp;Can you motivate<br>
others?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
18. The character with which you apply will be the character you are<br>
expected to bring to raids. &nbsp;You will only have one main character in<br>
the eyes of Afterlife. &nbsp;Do you understand and agree to this?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
19. What Alternate Advancement abilities have you purchased?<br>

<br>
20. &nbsp;Now that you've filled out this application, put it away for a<br>
day. &nbsp;Read your responses again. &nbsp;Do they still ring true? &nbsp;Do you have<br>
any questions you want to ask me before returning the application? &nbsp;Make<br>
