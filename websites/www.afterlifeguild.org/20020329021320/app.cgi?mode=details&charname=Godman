<h4>Application</h4>
<table border=0>
<tr><td>
1. Carefully read over the requirements found at<br>
&lt;a href="http://www.afterlifeguild.org/?page=joining"&gt;<br>
http://www.afterlifeguild.org/?page=joining&lt;/a&gt;. &nbsp;If you do not meet all<br>
of the level, item, skill, and other requirements, please list which ones,<br>
why, and in what timeframe you expect to achieve them. &nbsp;If you have any<br>
questions about the requirements, email recruiter@afterlifeguild.org<br>
and ask before submitting this application.<br>
<br>
I meet all the requirements. Now, the question is, do you meet mine?<br>
<br>
2. Has an Afterlife member agreed to sponsor you? If so, who? If more<br>
than one person agreed to sponsor you, list them all. &nbsp;Your sponsor<br>
should be someone who can answer any questions you have about the way<br>
Afterlife operates. &nbsp;Your sponsor is also someone who will vouch for you<br>
as a good recruit.<br>
<br>
All Afterlife members vouch for me, including you. I am Godman.<br>
<br>
3. Which Afterlife members have you grouped with, and what did you do<br>
while grouped? &nbsp;What was the group/raid's mission, and what was your<br>
role?<br>
<br>
I have grouped with all your members, in more ways than one. My role was as Godman, and sometimes as Godboy. The mission was to spread the legend of Afterlife, and Godman.<br>
<br>
4a. List all your 55+ characters (name/class/level/race). &nbsp;Only list<br>
characters to which you have exclusive access.<br>
<br>
Godman (60) High Elf Enchanter<br>
Godboy (59) Wood Elf Druid<br>
Goddude (60) Erudite Wizard<br>
Godbrother (50) Iksar Monk<br>
Goddoc (57) High Elf Cleric<br>
Godrunt (1) Gnome Warrior<br>
<br>
4b. List all your characters of the 20th level or higher whom you would<br>
plan on guilding should your application be accepted.<br>
<br>
Godman (60) High Elf Enchanter<br>
Godboy (59) Wood Elf Druid<br>
Goddude (60) Erudite Wizard<br>
Godbrother (50) Iksar Monk<br>
Goddoc (57) High Elf Cleric<br>
<br>
5a. List your raiding experiences. &nbsp;Where and what have you killed while<br>
on raids?<br>
<br>
I have killed everything imaginable. I am Godman. I rule. The POD hates me because I am Godman. I would too, if I was him.<br>
<br>
5b. &nbsp;Describe a time when you and your group or raid wiped out. &nbsp;Analyze<br>
what happened. &nbsp;What was your role in picking up the pieces?<br>
<br>
I am Godman, I don't f--- up. But this one time, I spilled coffee on my lap, and I fainted. The group all died ten times, because Godman was not there to bless them. But when I woke up, I saved them, and all was good in the world again.<br>
<br>
5c. &nbsp;Describe a time when you and your group or raid succeeded. &nbsp;Analyze<br>
what went right. &nbsp;What was your role in the success?<br>
<br>
This time, I did not spill my coffee.<br>
<br>
6. List all the guilds you've been in and why you left them. &nbsp;If you are<br>
currently guilded, why do you wish to leave them?<br>
(Guild/dates/levels/reason for leaving)<br>
<br>
I am Godman. No guild is yet worthy of Godman. Are you worthy of Godman?<br>
<br>
7. List any problems you've had with Afterlife or its members. &nbsp;List the<br>
member's name and explain the situation.<br>
<br>
Godman has no problems with anyone. Except Godrunt. I need to punt him sometimes to keep him in check.<br>
<br>
8. Describe what Afterlife and you can do for each other.<br>
<br>
Godman can bring Afterlife to the next level. The level of computer programming and making new planes for us to go to. For example, on my personal Godcomputer, I have created the Plane of Godman where I am the leader. I wish to take Afterlife there to explore. But don't raid me. That will make Godman very upset. I might spill my coffee.<br>
<br>
8a. &nbsp;Why are you applying? &nbsp;What do you want to get out of joining<br>
Afterlife?<br>
<br>
I want company. The Plane of Godman can be a very lonely place.<br>
<br>
8b. &nbsp;What would you bring to Afterlife? &nbsp;What distinguishes you from all<br>
of the other applicants?<br>
<br>
I am Godman. I have my own plane. I make my own coffee.<br>
<br>
9a. &nbsp;What positions of leadership have you held, formally or informally,<br>
within EverQuest?<br>
<br>
I am Godman. I am the leader of the Plane of Godman. Dude, what is up with these questions?<br>
<br>
9b. &nbsp;Think of a specific instance in which you had to exercise<br>
leadership -- some aspect of running a raid, or perhaps a guild conflict<br>
handled while an officer. &nbsp;Give a play by play of how you handled the<br>
situation. &nbsp;Explain what you did and why you did it. &nbsp;What mistakes did<br>
you make? &nbsp;What would you do differently now? &nbsp;What did you learn?<br>
<br>
Remember I spilled my coffee? My focking group went nuts and started believing in Idolman. I said, no way, dude. Fock this. I make a big flood, keel them all. Because dude, they aint worth it. I am Godman.<br>
<br>
What I should do differently? Yeah, dont spill my focking coffee. I learn it is hot.<br>
<br>
10. If you were given 30 seconds to teach a newbie how to play your<br>
primary character, what would you say to that person? What is the most<br>
critical element of your game play? &nbsp;This isn't a trick question; we<br>
know you wouldn't let someone else play your account, and we know you<br>
couldn't teach them to play as well as you do. &nbsp;We want to know how well<br>
you can convey the basics of your class.<br>
<br>
No one can master the Godman.<br>
<br>
11. If you aren't level 60 yet, why not? &nbsp;In what timeframe do you<br>
expect to reach 60?<br>
<br>
I expect to reach Level 60 two years ago.<br>
<br>
12. Do you have your epic weapon? If not, why not?<br>
<br>
Come close. I will show you a REAL epic weapon. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.<br>
<br>
13. What connection (modem, dsl, cable, ect) and hardware (CPU, RAM,<br>
video card)do you use? Do you have any trouble staying connected and<br>
moving with 50+ players on your screen?<br>
<br>
Not only am I the leader of the Plane of Godman, I am also the president of my own DSL company. Godman DSL. $599.99 a month for the best internet service of your young life. Available only if you live on my block.<br>
<br>
14. How many days a week do you play, and what are your normal playing<br>
hours? &nbsp;Please distinguish between your weekday and weekend schedule.<br>
Is your raid availability the same as your play time? &nbsp;If not, please<br>
elaborate.<br>
<br>
I am the president of my own DSL company. I am a millionaire. I drink coffee. I dont sleep, I have free time all day long. I am always on. I am Godman.<br>
<br>
15. How many days do you have played on your primary character? &nbsp;If you<br>
have more days played on another character, how many days do you have<br>
played on it, and what class/level is it?<br>
<br>
I have a computer lab with 300 computers that I control on one single control panel. Each one has been played for two years straight. I lead guild raids with my own 300 accounts. So many names, I cant remember. I am Godman, what else matters?<br>
<br>
16a. &nbsp;What is your best EverQuest memory/experience ever? &nbsp;This doesn't<br>
have to be raid related, although it may be.<br>
<br>
Ah.....when Godrunt was born. We were so proud.<br>
<br>
16b. &nbsp;What is your worst EverQuest memory/experience ever? &nbsp;This also<br>
doesn't have to be raid related, although it may be.<br>

<br>
17. &nbsp;Rate yourself from 1 to 5 on the following attributes, 1 being<br>
sub-par, 5 being excellent. &nbsp;Give a ONE LINE elaboration on each. &nbsp;If<br>
you give yourself fives across the board, I expect you to back it up.<br>
&lt;p&gt;<br>
17a. &nbsp;Personality: How well do you get along with other people?<br>
<br>
5-Godman is loved by all. I have my own fansite. Do you want to join my club?<br>
<br>

expected to bring to raids. &nbsp;You will only have one main character in<br>
the eyes of Afterlife. &nbsp;Do you understand and agree to this?<br>

Godman knows Godman is main.<br>

20. &nbsp;Now that you've filled out this application, put it away for a<br>
day. &nbsp;Read your responses again. &nbsp;Do they still ring true? &nbsp;Do you have<br>
any questions you want to ask me before returning the application? &nbsp;Make<br>
changes as necessary.<br>
<br>
I wish to ask you if Afterlife is worthy of Godman<br>
