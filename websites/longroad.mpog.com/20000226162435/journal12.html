    </font>
      <p><font size="2">It took Surfal two nights to completely recover from his
      near death experience. We stayed on the island under the watchful eye of
      the Kerrans. It was obvious that these Kerrans hold little love for us but
      they have kept us safe from harm during Surfal's recovery and I am
      thankful for that.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">Brent, Valarie and I have all taken our turns exploring
      the island and I have been amazed by the local wildlife. Only a few of the
      indigenous creatures here are non-hostile which accounts for the many
      rotting corpses on the beach. The bodies don't last long however as the
      local Kerran Spiders and Beetles pick them clean daily. Perhaps one of the
      most frightening creatures on the island are the huge Vampire Bats.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">Some who come here are left affected. I have seen
      wild-eyed madmen wandering the island attacking everything they see and
      crying out to people who aren't there. I feel this entire island is
      cursed.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">With Surfal still trying to recover, we have not tried
      to further explore the sunken ship off the coast , though I am sure we
      will find some clue about the apprentice there. There are still many
      undead souls to be released in that place and Karana would be disappointed
      if I were to leave them in this twisted form.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">Now that Surfal seems better, we will head back in the
      morning. I want to leave this island as soon as possible.</font></p>
      <p><font size="1"><b>Day Seventy-Six - Erud's Crossing</b></font></p>
      <p><font size="2">Once I had bestowed the blessings and wards of Karana
      upon my friends, I waded into the ocean towards the sunken wreck. The
      light from my lightstone allowed me to see in the murky depths and I
      quickly caught sight of three zombies. I called upon the wrath of Karana
      and punished the first with a magical blast. All three came hard and fast.
      Considering their decayed state and the fact that they were in deep water,
      I was shocked by their speed.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">As I surfaced on the beach, all three were delivering
      fierce blows. To my relief, Surfal had Valarie and Brent waiting at the
      water's edge. He would not be surprised by these again, I told myself.</font></p>
      <p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/eruds.gif"></p>
      <p><font size="2">Focusing our efforts on one at a time, we quickly
      released the three twisted spirits and their rotten bones sank into the
      wet sand. I returned to the wreck seven more times, each time bringing
      back two or three zombies. The last group I found included a smallish
      zombie who wore a satchel. Once released, Valarie searched the satchel to
      discover a water-stained and blurred map. I looked at the ragged corpse's
      clothes and knew it was the apprentice. I bowed down to Karana and said a
      prayer that his spirit reach its resting place with peace and tranquility.</font></p>
      <p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/intheteeth.gif"></p>
      <p><font size="2">After one more search of the wreck to make sure no more
      zombies lurked there, the four of us headed to the docks. As we walked, I
      noticed Surfal cock his head to the right and sniff the air. That usually
      meant trouble. I re-summoned my magical hammer and took a defensive
      position, quietly instructing Val and Brent to do the same.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">Surfal suddenly drew his blade and from over the dune a
      giant Vampire Bat swooped down upon us. At first, I was relieved. We had butchered
      many such beasts and I did not expect another would be trouble. Then I
      noticed that this Bat had an undead pet. The skeleton, which cackled as it
      swung at me, was incredibly strong. Surfal shattered the confusion with a
      stern command, &quot;Everyone focus on this cursed Bat!&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">We all turned our attentions to the Bat, who was now
      casting spells! While I brought my hammer down towards its head I made a
      haunting realization. Its eyes. It had human eyes. This was no Vampire
      Bat, this was a Necromancer. A vile fiend in the tradition of Varsoon
      disguised as a Bat to take his prey off their guard. As I felt the rage
      well up within me, I gave the fiend all I had, continuing to crush his
      body after he fell. When I calmed down enough to realize the battle with
      the Necromancer was over, I remembered the pet. I spun on my heels and saw
      Surfal, Valarie and Brent working hard against the walking dead. I
      summoned up the last of my magical strength and sent a powerful bolt into
      the skeletal pet shattering its bones into dust.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">I collapsed into the sand, desperately in need of rest.
      As I started to meditate to regain my strength, I heard Surfal exclaim,
      &quot;The Bat is changing. Gods! Its a human...some sort of
      magician.&quot; Valarie explained the Necromancer's magicks to Surfal and
      Brent while I meditated. The Necromancer was heavy with loot, no doubt
      collected from his unwitting victims, and again we headed to the docks.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">I would sleep tonight on the deck of a ship and it would
      be the most comfortable bed I have had in days. I just wish that we had
      better news for the mysterious woman in Qeynos whose apprentice we had
      come to search for.</font></td>
