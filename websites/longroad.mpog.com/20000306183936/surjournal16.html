      <p>I don’t think I have ever been as happy to see a city in all my young
      years. The smells that used to repulse me now seemed as welcome as scent
      of flowers in the plains of Karana. It seems ages since we left for the
      island but now we are back. I will carry the scar across my midriff as a
      constant reminder of the lessons I learned on the island but I believe
      that I have grown. I have learned the value of patience and the wisdom of
      following orders.</p>
      <p>As I neared the Fish’s Ale for a bite to eat, a parchment nailed to
      the wall caught my eye. Jhared had already left to find the woman who had
      sent us on that godforsaken quest but I wish he had waited a while longer.
      He would have found this message quite interesting.</p>
      <blockquote>

          </font><i><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="1">
          <p>Hear ye, hear ye</p>
          <p>By order of the high council of High Keep I am charged with seeking
          out brave adventurers for a most important task. Our Keep is under
          constant attack from both sides by two different factions. The
          Mucktail Gnolls have laid siege to our passageway to East Karana.
          Likewise, the Shralok Orcs have begun an assault on our passageway to
          Kithicor Woods.</p>
          <p>Payment will be made for every orc scalp secured by Captain Ashlan
          and Volunteer Delharn. Likewise, Captain Orban will be paying for
          every gnoll scalp turned in.</font></i><font FACE="Tempus Sans ITC" SIZE="2"></p>

      <p>I had thought we had crushed the orc hordes in Rivervale but it seems a
      new faction has arisen. Why does the name Shralok sound so familiar to me?
      Could it have been a name that Fyodor has spoken, or perhaps Grannith?
      These are questions that perhaps Jhared can answer. For now, eating doesn’t
      seem as such a high priority; I must track down Jhared and make him aware
      of this.</font><font FACE="Tempus Sans ITC" SIZE="2"></font></td>
