    </font><font SIZE="2"><p>As if out of a dream, she once more entered my life. By far, she
    is the largest female I have ever seen. Granted, to an elf almost every race seems larger
    but this barbarian is just so big. Tracking her had been easy but the smaller tracks that
    followed her own were much harder to follow. Training and experience told me that a monk
    was either with her, or following her. I surely hope for the monk&#146;s sake that he is a
    friend for if he isn&#146;t, I am quite certain that the barbarian shaman known as Valarie
    will be the last sight he ever sees.</p>
    <p>As we topped the last dune on the beach we saw the source of the screams and the
    clashing sounds. Three undead sailors surrounded Valarie and a monk and they were barely
    holding their own. Valarie appeared to be bleeding from a wound on her shoulder and neck
    and the monk was greatly outmatched. Another thirty seconds and the skirmish would be over
    and the zombies would be turning their attention towards us.</p>
    <p>I drew my new weapon and started sprinting towards the fray as Jhared began his
    clerical chants. Valarie also began a chant of her own, which seemed to fill me with
    strength. &quot;Why doesn&#146;t she heal herself?&quot; I was pondering, when the
    scimitar one of the sailors was wielding struck true through my leggings. The monk&#146;s
    hands began to glow and he punched the undead abomination squarely in the chest, ending
    its life force. Jhared had moved around and into the water and exploded his weapon into
    the back of another. The last remaining zombie cracked its staff over Valerie&#146;s open
    wound and crashed her to the sand. I felt sure she was beyond our help now but Jhared was
    already casting a protective magic over her fallen body. The monk, I could now see that it
    was Brent, dropped to one knee and drove his fist completely through the mid section of
    the remaining undead creature at the exact time that my blade severed it&#146;s head.</p>

    <p>It took all three of us to help Valarie to her feet. As Jhared tended to her wounds,
    Brent sat down and began to meditate. &quot;How long have you been here?&quot; I asked.</p>
    <p>&quot;Three days, maybe four&quot;, he started, &quot;We were heading to the city of
    high humans and got off at the wrong dock&quot;.</p>
    <p>Was it luck, or fate that brought us together? Karana does work in strange ways. As I
    looked to where the fight had just taken place I noticed that the zombie tracks were
    leading up from the water. Stepping away from the others I cast Glimpse upon myself so
    that I might get a better look as to what was out there. About three hundred paces from
    the shoreline I could make out a tree sticking straight up in the air. A closer, more
    detailed look, revealed it to be part of ship. Could this be the ship in question? If it
    were then my plans of heroism would have to be drastically changed. I was an average
    swimmer under the best of circumstances, and this was far from the best of circumstances. </p>
    <p>I told Jhared, Brent, and the recovering Valarie that the ship lay due east in the
    water, but was beyond my swimming abilities. Worse yet, I can track at least three more
    figures that have passed this way heading back into the deep water. I am certain that
    whoever swims out there has a better than average chance of never returning. </font></td>
