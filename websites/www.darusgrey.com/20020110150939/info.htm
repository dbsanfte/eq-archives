        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Structure:</b></p>
        <p>There are 4 Levels of membership:</p>
        <p>Recruit - You have applied to the guild and have been tagged for
        recruitment purposes during recruitment you will receieve no loot on
        raids unless it will rott.</p>
        <p>Member- You have attended no less then 5 raids and have shown
        qualities to be admired in a member. You now have oppurtunity to obtain
        loot from raids.</p>
        <p>Full Member- You have attended no less then 15 raids, have shown
        qualities to be admired, have went out of your way to help fellow
        members, and have been voted in (to be voted in..you must be voted in by
        EVERY other full member of guild), full members have access to guildbank
        .</p>
        <p>Officer - IO is run by a council of officers, these officers make all important
        decisions regarding the guild, including schedule, loot, etc.</p>
        <p>All decisions are made on one simple principle <i>What's best for the
        guild , </i>loot is assigned to where its use will most benefit us all.</p>
        <p><b>Loot:</b></p>
        <p>You will&nbsp; earn a point alotment based on attendence.<br>
        Scheduled raids - 10pts<br>
        Non-schduled raids-5pts<br>
        Epic-Raids/Helping-2pts<br>
        <br>
        There will be a minimum attendence time..which i&nbsp; keep secret to
        avoid abuse.<br>
        <br>
        Loot rolls will all be on a 100-999 scale. your point total will be
        added to this roll. when you win an item your total will go down 10pts
        for most items, 35 for larger items (bps, legs, dragon loot)...there
        will be 2 numbers then...your total points and your actual
        points....total points will be used as a gauge for officers to decide on
        certain items that *should* be awarded as opposed to randomed.<br>
        <br>
        Regular Members will be restricted to Winning 2 peices in case of armor
        raids, and 1 item per non-armor raid. Per raid.<br>
        <br>
        This allows us to have a more efficent randomized senority system,
        people who dedicate thier time will still get equiped faster, well
        allowing ALL members a chance.<br>
        <br>
        Some things will not be changed. Certain &quot;Uber&quot; items will be
        designated as &quot;award&quot;. These items will be discussed by
        officers, possably in advance as to who should loot.<br>
