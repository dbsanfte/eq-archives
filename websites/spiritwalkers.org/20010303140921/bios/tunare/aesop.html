            <td colspan="3"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Born 
              Aesophaenis Thelemenes Ezerhauk; son of High Councillor Jandeel 
              Ovidias Ezerhauk, about the only thing Aesop (as he prefers to be 
              called) has in common with his Erudite brethren is an agnostic streak. 
              <br>
              <br>
              From an early age he was always a misfit among his peers, and even 
              his rather impressive and natural aptitude for magic (not to mention 
              having a high-ranking father) did little to spare him from frequent 
              consternation over his oft-aired contrary opinions and restless 
              nature. <br>
              <br>
              His father served on the High Council and had little time or patience 
              for him; his mother had died soon after he was born. As a result 
              Aesop grew up a very independent child. Though an apt and eager 
              pupil in his studies of magic, history, and the world in general, 
              he had little patience in his more formal lessons pertaining to 
              law, the Councils, and the political maneuverings thereof that are 
              the lifeblood of Erudite society, often spending much of his time 
              dreaming of the world beyond the sea and of discovering entire new 
              worlds to explore. <br>
              <br>
              Despite receiving mixed Letters from many a tutor (that is, evaluations 
              that were frequently peppered with strong warnings and criticisms), 
              it was his fascination in new worlds that brought high Letters in 
              his studies of all things elemental. It was through his fascination 
              of the elemental planes that he forged a bond with Tidaneus (or 
              "Tidy" as he would playfully call him), the elder groundskeeper 
              and tending squire for the Ezerhauk House who had always had a special 
              fondness for the restless boy. <br>
              <br>
              Aesop dreamed of being a wizard and travelling Norrath at will, 
              and many a time would he pester Tidy (or any elder that he could) 
              for information about Elemental Travel and the Planes, which was 
              strictly forbidden before Trials. While his father did not approve 
              of such close associations between his already oft-distracted son 
              and the house help, it soon became clear that Tidaneaus was a grounding 
              force and good teacher to young Aesop, and so their friendship was 
              tolerated. This later proved to be a boon when Aesop underwent his 
              Trials and emerged a Magician, for it was Tidaneus' support and 
              encouragement that helped Aesop refocus his efforts constructively 
              despite the loss of what was then his greatest dream.<br>
              <br>
              Tragically, it was the death of Tidaneaus that ultimately drove 
              Aesop to leave Erudin. It was brought to the attention of the High 
              Council (quite possibly by a rival House) that Tidaneaus had close 
              associations with and had on occasion helped a local group of Heretics 
              (that is, Necromancers) -- an act punishable by death. In accordance 
              with Erudite law, Tidaneaus was summarily sentenced to Purging (a 
              rather brutal form of capital punishment). <br>
              <br>
              Angered and outraged at his father's refusal to speak on behalf 
              of Tidaneaus and powerless to act in his defense, Aesop risked life 
              and limb to visit his old friend one last time, against his father's 
              explicit orders, intending to free his old friend by any means necessary. 
              Aesop succeeded in finding Tidaneaus, who, in the last words he 
              would ever speak, told him that Aesop must leave Erudin at once, 
              breaking all ties and titles with his family, for it was a matter 
              of life and death and great import. Aesop, confused, asked why, 
              whereupon Tidaneaus explained to him the secret he had helped keep 
              hidden for all of Aesop's youth -- that his long-lost mother was 
              not of Erudin, having originally come from Faydwer. <br>
              <br>
              Tidaneaus told Aesop of a hidden place where he had stowed a small 
              box containing a few items that he had hoped might someday help 
              him find the other half of his legacy, as well as proof of his lineage. 
              But it was with a heavy heart that he warned him the danger of this 
              knowledge, for while Erudin was open to all who would come to learn 
              of magic, Erudin society was strictly closed to other races, and 
              family ties with other races were neither recognized nor tolorated, 
              as it was felt they tainted the purity of Erud's original children. 
              <br>
              <br>
              In the hands of his father's enemies, information of Jandeel's deception 
              (as he had claimed Aesop True-Born and none would question a Councillor 
              without proof) threatened to fracture the High Council, possibly 
              driving all of Erudin into civil war. Aesop was later able to find 
              this evidence, but his conversation with Tidaneaus had not gone 
              unheard by enemy ears, and, finding himself followed and eventually 
              pursued by mercenaries from a rival house, he had no choice but 
              to destroy all evidence of his past as quickly as he was able to 
              find it.<br>
              <br>
              He knew precious little, only that he must someday journey to a 
              place called Felwithe. Bitter, disillusioned, and robbed of all 
              he held sacred, Aesop left Erudin, took a new, simpler name, and 
              spent many years drifting, hoping he might find a way to someday 
              find his lost roots...</font></td>
