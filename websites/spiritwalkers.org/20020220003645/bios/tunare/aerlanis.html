              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Aerlanis 
                was born into a wealthy Erudite family. Her father one of the 
                High Council, her mother a warm-hearted Enchantress. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Aerlanis 
                took to learning very early, intent on becoming an Enchantress 
                like her mother. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Things turned 
                dark for Aerlanis in a way few can conceive. Foul Bandits struck 
                into the heart of a Peace Negotiation Party Aerlanis' Father was 
                leading across the Plains of Karanas. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">After a long 
                battle the Erudites lay dying. Being so young, Aerlanis could 
                not fight, yet was spared for an even worse fate. She was taken 
                .. kidnapped .. and forced into slavery. She was sold to the Heretics 
                and forced into submission. Aerlanis, was broken of spirit and 
                honor -- wishing to see her family again, she did as she was told 
                and spoke to no one. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">After years 
                of labour and abuse from the Heretics, she became trusted by them. 
                She was allowed to aid them at their rituals. Aerlanis became 
                wary of the practices which the Necromancers used to raise the 
                dead. She kept quiet and watched everything. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Aerlanis 
                began to learn the basic secrets of these Heretics and took to 
                pilfering scrolls and artefacts used by them. She practiced in 
                the darkness of her little room. Until finally, she did it .... 
                A Skeleton began to rise from the ground, assembling itself into 
                a form and communicating with her. It was a voice she had not 
                heard in a very very long time. A tender voice of compassion and 
                love. It was her <i>FATHER</i>. She had wanted do much to see 
                her family that she had brought her father back from the dead. 
                He gave her strength and the will to go on. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Aerlanis 
                kept practicing any spell she could. She continued summoning other 
                family members to sit and talk to. Finally, she found a spell 
                she could use to escape. During a wild Heretic ritual she was 
                able to decipher a spell to gather shadows about her. After the 
                ritual was done the Heretics all lay in a heap of drunken blood-ncrusted 
                maniacs. She used this new spell and walked into the shadows and 
                away from the vile Heretics </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">She now uses 
                her new-found powers to summon her long dead relatives to aid 
                her in survival. In one of her journeys she befriended a young 
                Druid. Rainbird was her name. Rainbird was not frightened of the 
                leering skeleton which accompanied Aerlanis. They became very 
                close and Rainbird introduced Aerlanis to the Spiritwalkers. Aerlanis 
                was welcomed to the guild and now has a another family to accompany 
                her, but will always keep her long-dead family by her side. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">If you happen 
                to see Aerlanis mumbling and staring at her Skeletal pet, remember 
                this is one of her family. </font></p>
