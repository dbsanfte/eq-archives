            who are part of this guild are working together as friends and loyal 
            companions. <br>

            This is a guild to come to for honest characters who are in the game 
            for fun and to meet interesting people. <br>
            &nbsp;<br>
            We are not a hack-and-slash guild. We're looking for new friends, 
            some fun of role-playing, and a chance to have a good time. We don't 
            just role-play, we do a lot of hunting, but we do role-playing with 
            the hunting. <br>
            &nbsp;<br>
            We welcome characters of all races, classes, genders and religions. 
            The more interesting, the better, but <i><b>anyone</b></i> may join 
            the Spiritwalkers. </font></p>
