            <td colspan="3"> 
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Ixla first 
                began adventuring in Tunare’s Norrath when the land was very young 
                and barely formed. Friends he made in his first hunts in the Nektulos 
                forest have reached 50th or beyond and retired before he was 20, 
                and another couple of generations of 1-to-50 have occurred since 
                then, while Ixla has barely aged past 35.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Apparently, 
                when very young, he nearly drowned in a fountain of youth. In 
                fact, his mother, a priestess of Innoruuk, expressed disappointment 
                that he survived. Young Ixla thought that all priestesses of Innoruuk 
                beat and tortured their male children. Eventually, frustrated 
                at his penchant for turning up alive yet once more, she said, 
                "Ixla, your worhtless mouth isn't worth the food I feed it. Go 
                and never return to this house again."</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">That is how 
                Ixla ended up at the Tower of the Spurned in Neriak, gravitating 
                toward the profession with the greatest opportunity for concealment 
                and escape - enchantment. Choosing wizardry or magery would have 
                been foolish. They are forthright magical fighters, and Ixla had 
                no taste for head-on fights.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">This sad 
                if not uncommon youth also shaped Ixla's attitude toward religion. 
                He has dedicated his life to frustrating Innoruuk and his message 
                whenever and wherever possible. Ixla takes great and perverse 
                pleasure in being kind, considerate, helpful, and mild-mannered. 
                Most of all, he judges others by their actions, not by the god 
                they profess to worship. Nevertheless, Ixla remains proud of his 
                Teir'Dal heritage and still enjoys visiting his native city. However, 
                he is very careful to avoid visiting the Red Temple beyond the 
                Third Gate.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Ixla joined 
                the Spiritwalkers because his close friends Electrae and Shandahr 
                had become members. Alas, since then, Electrae and her cousins 
                (Wsyteria, Lysteria, etc.) have left for another world, while 
                Shandahr's elder kin (Drexxen, Armis, etc.) are now voidrunners. 
                But this gradual transformation of circles of frinds simply serves 
                to expand his own. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Recently, 
                Ixla was delighted to receive the princely gift of a Shardwurm 
                Coat from some senior voidrunners. Having never found robes that 
                attractive, he is overjoyed to finally have a elegant and attractive 
                appearance that makes him unique among the enchanters of Tunare.</font></p>
