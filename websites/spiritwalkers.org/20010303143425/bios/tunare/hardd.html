              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&nbsp;I am 
                the last of the Walker tribe. We are the greatest of the warriors 
                and hunters of Norrath. My father was a great warrior, and his 
                father, and his father also. My uncles were all great warriors. 
                Walkers have fought honorably in all the great fights and hunts. 
                Walkers have slain dragons, mammoths, and anyone who have come 
                to war against us. This is in the lands of the north. Foreigners 
                call it Everfrost, I have learned. We had no special name for 
                our lands. We just lived there, following the mammoths.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&#9;&nbsp;Gramps 
                was in charge of the testing and training of great warriors. Even 
                warriors from the wood elves and the trolls and the ogres would 
                travel huge distances to beg for his training. I was a boy, and 
                he had taken me out for the Final Test Of A Warrior, so that I 
                would be a man. The rest of the clan was back at the camp site, 
                preparing a feast to celebrate my feat. I completed the Test with 
                pleasure. It was easy to me. We returned to our camp. As we approached 
                the camp, we could hear the screams of children and the war cries 
                of a few men and women warriors. I recognized my own mother's 
                war cry. We ran to see. The noise had all stopped as we got in 
                sight of the camp, except the noise of two ice giants stomping 
                away in the other direction. I could see Father hacking at one 
                of the giants, which he had already hurt terribly. But the other 
                giant struck him from behind his peripheral vision, so he could 
                not defend, and he was smashed to the ground with a broken neck. 
                And there was something else, something about them that seemed 
                magick, and like they were not alone. This magick was not from 
                our own shamans of the Walkers, I knew what that felt like. This 
                was very evil, and even I could tell it was very strong.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&#9;&nbsp;One 
                giant was moving very slowly, and we could see 'twas badly hurt.Gramps 
                told me to run to our tent and see who could be saved. Then he 
                ran after the giants. I will never forget the look in his eye.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&nbsp;At 
                our tent, father was dead. Still warm, of course. Mother was suffering 
                and in unbelievable pain. It was obvious she would be dead soon. 
                One of my little infant sisters was still breathing enough to 
                cry, but she would be dead soon too. My other brothers and sisters 
                were already dead. Mother told me again of her love for me, and 
                father and my brothers and sisters. Then she had me hold her upright 
                enough to deliver the mercy stroke to my sister, and then to herself. 
                As is right for any honorable warrior. She was crying, but there 
                is no shame in that for a woman.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&#9;&nbsp;I 
                was still very young then, so I will tell you that I was crying 
                freely as I ran to the tents of my friends and cousins, things 
                were the same all around the camp. I had to cut the mercy stroke 
                on several of my relatives that day. I ran to catch Gramps and 
                help him. Gramps was a legend of a warrior, and there are many 
                tales of his greatness. He had more wives than anyone could remember 
                any warrior ever having, because he was so great a warrior. Gramps 
                could slay an ice giant alone. I was afraid though, because of 
                that evil magick that was heavy around those giants that day.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&#9;&nbsp;I 
                caught up just as Gramps was laying a decapatitating stroke through 
                a giant's neck with his zweihander. He used a roundhouse technique 
                that he would normally have told me not to use, because it is 
                too slow and telegraphs to the opponent. But Gramps was in the 
                most perfect of berserker warrior rages I have ever seen, and 
                the roundhouse was swifter than even a skilled jab. He cut the 
                giant's carotid, and cut with such strength and skill, he severed 
                it's huge head. Gramps was indeed a legendary warrior, and I am 
                proud to be his grandson.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&#9;&nbsp;The 
                evil magick was not in the air now. The other giant was not nearby. 
                Gramps had perfect control of his breathing, as he told me to 
                ready my bow and follow him. Quick and quiet, we began running. 
                </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&#9;&nbsp;We 
                caught up to the second giant, though I don't know how. Everyone 
                knows giants are too fast. I think our gods and the spirits of 
                our dead families aided us somehow. Gramps was still in a perfect 
                combat state. He pointed to a clever notch in the icy rocks, and 
                told me to begin shooting when I heard his war cry. Quickly, I 
                scrambled into position and counted my arrows. I had 120 arrows. 
                I knew I was not nearly experienced enough to make any of my weapons 
                count against a giant, but 'twas my combat assignment to try.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&#9;&nbsp;Gramps 
                ran up behind the giant, it all unaware. With his war cry ringing 
                proudly from the surrounding ice walls, Gramps slashed a perfect 
                hamstringing cut at this ignoble but mighty foe. It was lamed 
                a bit, it would not be running away. Gramps began insulting and 
                taunting this icy giant.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&#9;&nbsp;They 
                fought. Almost any of the giant's blows would have instantly slain 
                Gramps if the giant could only get a direct hit. But Gramps was 
                the greatest of master warriors, and always dodged to avoid all 
                or most of the damage. His combat state was perfect, and you could 
                see that his wounds were worse and worse but he wasn't letting 
                the pain bother him. I finally forced my tears to quit. They were 
                spoiling my aim. Gramps was my example of control of self. I began 
                firing arrows at the giant's head more accurately, hoping to get 
                an eye or other vulnerable spot. I watched, as Gramps showed how 
                a great warrior can beat even another mighty warrior who is much 
                bigger and stronger. But not without terrible cost to his own 
                body.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&#9;&nbsp;After 
                a while, you could see the fear growing in the giant. I don't 
                know how long they had been fighting, but I was almost out of 
                arrows. Gramps was moving stiffly, and bleeding from many places, 
                but the giant was bleeding even more. Gramps began speaking curses 
                on the giant, and all the giant's kin. A steady stream of curses 
                that the gods must surely be listening to. Spoken in rhythm with 
                the cutting strokes of his black and blood-covered blade.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&nbsp;The 
                giant began to fight as one who is trying to get away, not one 
                trying to win. Then, almost dead and gone from our world, it yelled 
                something in its tongue that must have been a cry for help. Too 
                late. Gramps again spun like lightning through a roundhouse and 
                cut through its carotid and most of the way through its neck! 
                But there was a sound I cannot describe, like in a huge thunderstorm 
                maybe, and Gramps was thrown 30 feet backwards, barely clinging 
                to his sword and shield now, hurt terribly. He was not too far 
                below me now, down on the icy plain, as I looked down at him, 
                then scanned everywhere for what had done this. The feeling of 
                that evil magick from before was near.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&#9;&nbsp;Gramps 
                looked up and said my name quietly. Our eyes met, and I saw in 
                his eyes the look I had already seen sometimes on opponents in 
                sparring when it was clear they were bested and the fight about 
                to be lost. He was not afraid, he showed no shame, embarrassment. 
                Only a warrior's control, and somewhere behind it all, his harnessed 
                rage and sadness. He hissed a command to me: "Run NOW, Hardd. 
                NOW." Obedient from years of training, I began leaping down the 
                rocks. I still don't know whether I was going to run as commanded, 
                or stop and help Gramps. Most of the way down the ice and rocks, 
                he spoke again to me "RUN AWAY! Make new sons and daughters,and 
                keep the Walkers alive. You will avenge us all one day, but you 
                must RUN."</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&#9;&nbsp;With 
                a cold and clear vision that only a trained warrior in a crisis 
                can have, I saw instantly he was right about everything. I ran.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&#9;&nbsp;Behind 
                me, I heard Gramps' war cry, and he laughed loudly as he was running 
                towards whatever it was that had cast that fearsome spell. I could 
                also hear the sound of that spell one last time. And then the 
                spell was done, and Gramps' laughing was done. I think I also 
                heard a scream, as from some night creature that had been struck 
                deeply and had never felt pain before.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&#9;&nbsp;After 
                running a long time, I found the big city of Halas, and found 
                our distant cousin, Mortekai. He showed me through this maze of 
                buildings. All made of wood and stone! Sometimes two stories tall! 
                He introduced me to the men who trained warriors in the city. 
                Fighters to respect, but they did not impress me so much as several 
                warriors of my own clan had. Mortekai gave me a new sword, and 
                one of his warriors gave me some old patchworked armor he had 
                replaced with metal armor. Weapons and armor were enough. I began 
                the work of training myself to avenge our clan, and raise a new 
                tribe of Walkers. I know why Gramps was laughing as he died. Because 
                he knew that I would succeed in this mission. I will some day 
                be a very great warrior, and I will avenge our tribe on the evil 
                caster of spells who massacred us. Gramps was enjoying his last 
                laugh over his foe.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&#9;&nbsp;Gramps 
                had travelled to many foreign places when he was younger, and 
                even would go on trips sometimes while I was growing up. He always 
                said he had learned a lot about combat, and studied many kinds 
                of foes, while travelling. He had brought back special weapons 
                and things that were powerful tools for a warrior. I knew I must 
                travel too, like he did. And especially, must study how to defeat 
                a powerful caster of spells.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&#9;&nbsp;I 
                worked at training a little more in Halas, but these city warriors 
                could not teach that much. I went south in my fourth season as 
                a warrior to find the way to the land of the elves, for people 
                said they knew more about spellcasting than anyone.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&#9;&nbsp;I 
                went many places, and met a beautiful young wood elf named Jehanni. 
                I had once glimpsed her when she came to visit her relative who 
                my grandfather was training. But I lost her again, maybe forever. 
                I have learned many things about fighting, and learned enough 
                to know there is still much more to learn.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&#9;&nbsp;One 
                day, my sons and nephews and I will return to our home and once 
                again camp and follow the mammoths and feast and train legendary 
                warriors and hunters. And on the day we return, we will find that 
                evil that slew our family and we will kill it and make its own 
                family die. And then life will be good again.</font></p>
