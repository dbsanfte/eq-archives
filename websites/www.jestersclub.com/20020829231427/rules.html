<h2>General Rules</h2>

<ol>
<li><b>Jesters Image</b> - As a member of the Jesters, you must uphold the image of the Jesters to everyone you come in contact with, including fellow Jesters.

<ol type="a">
<li>If a conflict occurs try to handle it in tells. <b>DO NOT</b> use guildspeak, ooc, or any other public channels to argue with someone. If you can not handle the conflict with tells then contact an officer. 
<li>Refrain from making stupid comments in public channels such as shout and ooc just to get attention. 
<li>Refrain for overusing "doodspeak" (i.e., plz, thx, l33t, etc.)
<li>During a raid keep raid chatter in guildchat, <b>including hotkey messages</b>. No one wants to be spammed with our raids. In some situations we may use another channel for raid chatter, which will be determined by the raid leader.
<li>Keep auctioning to a minimum in non-auction zones. <b>DO NOT</b> auction during a Jesters raid. 
<li>Never say or do anything that would be considered selfish or greedy.
</ol><br>

<li><b>Recruitment and Membership</b>

<ol type="a">
<li>The first step for new recruits is to post on our <a href="http://boards.gamers.com/messages/overview.asp?name=jestersnews&page=1">EQ guild message board</a> <b>AND</b> read these rules. 
<li>New recruits must have at least one person who will vouch for him. You must be a Jester for a least one month in order to vouch/sponsor someone. 
<li>New recruits need to obtain 5 "yes" votes on the voting board. If there are any "no" votes it will be discussed amongst the officers. <b>You can only vote on someone if you have actually played with the person or talked to them extensively in tells</b>. Voting is just a tool for the officers; the officers make the final decision on who gets invited. 
<li>If you vote "no" on someone you are encoraged to talk to an officer privately about any issues you have with this person.
<li>After you are invited you will be given access to our private message board. Ask an officer if you don't have the password. 
<li>You are encouraged to visit the <a href="http://boards.gamers.com/messages/overview.asp?name=jestersnews&page=1">message boards</a>, check the <a href="http://expira.com/cgi-bin/calendar/display.pl">calendar</a> and <a href="http://pub47.ezboard.com/beqjesters">vote</a> on new recruits. 
</ol><br>

<li><b>Raids</b>

<ol type="a">
<li>All melee classes must have with them a gate potion (Shaman, Thurg, store-bought, etc.) to EVERY raid as a back up. We cannot rely on our porting classes to get people out.
<li>Listen to the raidleader(s) instructions. Be aware. 
<li>Don't be late. The posted raid time is when we plan on starting a raid, you should get there 30-60 minutes beforehand. If you are late you will likely be left behind.
<li>Make sure someone knows if you are AFK. Tell your group members or announce it in /say, /guild, etc. You should also autofollow someone in your group so you don't get left behind, usually a cleric is a good person to autofollow. 
<li>Do not expect to get experience on a raid. Groups will be designed for the success of the raid, not to distribute experience. 
<li>Do not go /anon or /role during raids so that the raid leaders can easily what classes and levels are on the raid. In some situations, however, it may be necessary for everyone to go /anon for secrecy (i.e., if we are mobilizing our forces for a rare spawn). 
<li>Do not expect to get loot; instead come to our raids to hang out with your friends and work together to have a successful raid. If you happen to be awarded an item then it is a bonus!
<li><b>NO BITCHING</b> is allowed whatsoever, please. 
</ol><br>

<li><b>If you see someone shout, "HAIL A DRUNKEN JESTER!" you must promptly reply, "FOR DA BEERZ!" everyone else after that shouts, "DA BEERZ!"
</ol></b>


<h2>Loot</h2>

<ol>
<li><b>Jester loot stays within the Jesters</b>. This applies to any Jesters-sponsored event. Jesters' loot is never sold.<br>
<br><li>If you are present at a raid when an item drops and you can and <B>WILL</b> use the item then you can roll. Please use your judgement here, if a drop only upgrades you by a slight margin and you know it's a big upgrade for others then you shouldn't roll. The raid leader and officers have the final say on who can roll.<br>
<br><li>NO DROP items will be rolled on the spot. Droppable items may be rolled on at the end of the raid or when it is more convenient. If you have to leave the raid early and would like to roll on an item that drops when you should tell the raid leader and the item will be rolled on. Loot will be announced when it is looted. <br>
<br><li>You may only win one item per raid. If everyone on the raid has won something then everyone can roll again until everyone has won two items, and so on.<br>
<br><li>If you win an item on a raid, then later on down the road you win an upgrade to that item you <b>MUST</b> give that item back to an officer. The item you gave back will then be rolled on by anyone else that can use it.<br>
<br><li>The raid leader has the right to designate certain classes to roll on an item, as long as other officers present agree. If the item benefits a certain class more than others even though it is equipable (i.e., Oiled Greaves, Wyvern Hide Boots, Lord Bob drops, etc.)<br>
<br><li>Raid leader has the right to "proxy" any specific loot drops as long as its announced before the raid.(i.e., if soandso drops then JesterX will get it). It will benefit the guild if raid leaders brush up on specific loot tables of zones before the raid and know what to announce.<br>
<br><li>Epic pieces are merited or rolled by the class furthest along in their epic. Unless <b>YOU</b> have organized a raid specifically for a piece you need.<br>
<br><li>If <b>YOU</b> organize a raid specifically for a quest item then you will get that piece. If you are camping an item that you need a raid force to obtain then you will get that item. <b>You must let everyone coming to the raid know that you would like the item to be merited to you</b>, if you do not say anything then the item will be open rolled.<br>
<br><li>Spells will go to people that can scribe the spell at that moment. Otherwise extra spells and quest gems will go to the <a href="http://boards.gamers.com/messages/overview.asp?name=TNMB&page=1">guild</a> bank until a Jester can scribe it. <br>
<br><li>Quest gems go to the <a href="http://boards.gamers.com/messages/overview.asp?name=TNMB&page=1">guild bank</a>. You may obtain a gem from the guild bank if you have the corresponding armor piece(s). <br>
<br><li>Blue Diamonds and Diamonds go to the guild bank. These gems will be made into jewelry that will be sold to Jesters at a marginal price. See the <a href="http://boards.gamers.com/messages/overview.asp?name=TNMB&page=1">guild bank</a> listing for more information. <br>
<br><li>All cash loot will be given to the person designated to collect loot. Only group leaders may loot a corpse, the group leaders will then give the loot to the loot collector when it's convenient or at the end of the raid. Cash loot will first go towards compensating clerics and other classes, then it will go into the guild bank. The guild bank will be used to finance other raids, compensate for people's expenses, etc. <br>
<br><li>Guests and recruits on a Jesters raid do not get loot unless the Raid leader invites them to fill a hole of a needed class. The raid leader and other officers present will decided if this person is essential for the raid's success. The needed person will have full loot rights as if they were a Jester. Any guest is welcome to join us on our raids, but under the assumption that they may not get any loot. Guests may be allowed to roll on trivial and common loot if no one in the guild objects.<br>
<br><li>These rules DO NOT apply on exp. groups or pickup groups, only Jester-sponsored raids.<br>
<br><li>Please refer to rule #1.
