<h1>First Draft of Charter</h1>
<p>The Jesters Club was created by a buncha fun luvin citizens of Norrath, for the citizens of Norrath, of the fun luvin citizens of Norrath. We are basically justa bunch of guys and gals who have a lot of fun together and want to role play their multiple characters together and have fun. 

<p>We are a loosely organized and slightly insane bunch, but we all share a merry  spirit for life on Norrath, dedicated to enjoying our time on Norrath together and trying to make it a better place. 

<p>Membership is open by invitation of any current guild members who are in good standing.  A member in good standing is defined as someone who has been playing with us for a while (about a month). There are NO limits on race, religion, or class (in game or out). At this time we are not accepting applications from NPC's. 

<p>Our place in Norrath is to tear around having fun, picking up stray newbies and giving them a tip or two, and to grow our world into the choose-yer-own adventure, beer swilling fun we know it can be.

<h3>We do have a few rules:</h3>
<p>To be a member of the Jesters Club you must make occasional postings to the current <a href="http://www.gamers.com/messages/overview.asp?name=JestersClub">Jester's Club Bulleting Board</a>.

<p>We are open to all "fun" loving characters, we only exclude those who are mean spirited or who tended to get report cards from school that said "does not play well with others."

<p>Your character can be a member of the Jesters Club and still belong to another guild.

<p>You are expected to role play to some extent, although it is not mandatory.  This does not mean you have to speak in foreign tongue, merely that your character develops a personality and normally tends to role play this personality.

<p>There is only one way to be expelled from the club and that is for a vote to be called for expulsion and the Yeahs to out vote the Nays by a ratio of 4 to 1.  There are really only two reasons for being expelled from the club:

<ol>
<li>You have managed to alienate over 80% of the members of the club
<li>You consistently perform acts that damage the name and reputation of the Club, such as treat others dishonorably.  
</ol>
<p>You can optionally agree to join the in-game guild associated with the Jester's Club.

<h3>Other thoughts not woven into charter.</h3>
<P>The primary reason for forming the club is to improve the quality of our fantasy experience.  Thus allow groups or armies to be formed more readily, to share ideas and stories and to basically have a place where we can sit by the fire, put our feet up and not be afraid of ridicule.  The Final name of the Jester's Club has not been chosen.  But it will probably be akin to the adventures clubs that were so popular at the turn of the century.

<p>There will also be a "Guild" formed on Bertoxxolous as part of the club.  It is not a requirement of membership to also be a member of the in-game guild.  The primary purpose of the in-game guild is to facilitate members talking to one another and finding each other.  This can be particularly frustrating when you are restricted to 25 characters on your friends list. 

<p>It is expected that "individuals" will have many characters that are part of the club [some may also be members of the guild].  It is also possible that we "exploit " Everquest a bit, but we would need their consent to do so.  I will send through an enhancement request on the subject of temporary guilds for exploration teams.  The basic idea is that for those of us who do not have a selected guild, it might be possible to form a main guild and two or three temp ones.  Why you ask??  Well,  Once a guild is formed, the "leaders" can add and delete members at will.  So..

<p>If an expedition were being sent to the cold north, they could remove their characters from the current guild, all be added to the temp one and set of.  that way a party of 15-20 could keep in contact.  A bit like an expedition to the Artic.  Just a thought.
