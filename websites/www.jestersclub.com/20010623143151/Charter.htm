      <h2><!--mstheme--><font color="#660033">First Draft of Charter<!--mstheme--></font></h2>

<b>
<p>The Jesters Club was created by a buncha fun luvin citizens of
Norrath, for the citizens of Norrath, of the fun luvin citizens of Norrath. We
are basically justa bunch of guys and gals who have a lot of fun together and
want to role play their multiple characters together and have fun.
<p>We are a loosely organized and slightly insane bunch, but we all share a
merry <img border="0" src="jester.gif" align="right" width="320" height="240"> spirit for life on Norrath, dedicated to enjoying our time on Norrath
together and trying to make it a better place.
<p>Membership is open by invitation of any current guild members who are in good
standing.&nbsp; A member in good standing is defined as someone who has been
playing with us for a while (about a month). There are NO limits on race, religion, or class (in game or
out). At this time we are not accepting applications from NPC.
<p>Our place in Norrath is to tear around having fun, picking up stray newbies
and giving them a tip or two, and to grow our world into the choose-yer-own
adventure, beer swilling fun we know it can be.</b></p>

      <h3><!--mstheme--><font color="#660033">We do have a few rules:<!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p>To be a member of the Jesters Club you must make occasional postings to the
current Jester's Club Bulleting Board [this is currently housed at <a href="http://www.everworld.net">www.everworld.net</a>
on the Bertoxxolous bulleting board].</p>

<p>We are open to all &quot;fun&quot; loving characters, we only exclude those
who are mean spirited or who tended to get report cards from school that said
&quot;does not play well with others.&quot;</p>

<p>Your character can be a member of the Jesters Club and still belong to
another guild.</p>

<p>You are expected to role play to some extent, although it is not
mandatory.&nbsp; This does not mean you have to speak in foreign tongue, merely
that your character develops a personality and normally tends to role play this
personality.</p>

<p>There is only one way to be expelled from the club and that is for a vote to
be called for expulsion and the Yeahs to out vote the Nays by a ratio of 4 to
1.&nbsp; There are really only two reasons for being expelled from the club:</p>

<ol>
  <li>You have managed to alienate over 80% of the members of the club&nbsp;</li>
  <li>You consistently perform acts that damage the name and reputation of the
    Club, such as treat others dishonorably.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

      <p>You can optionally agree to join the in-game guild associated with the
      Jester's Club.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>**********************</p>

      <h3><!--mstheme--><font color="#660033">Other thoughts not woven into charter.<!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p>The primary reason for forming the club is to improve the quality of our
fantasy experience.&nbsp; Thus allow groups or armies to be formed more readily,
to share ideas and stories and to basically have a place where we can sit by the
fire, put our feet up and not be afraid of ridicule.&nbsp; The Final name of the
Jester's Club has not been chosen.&nbsp; But it will probably be akin to the
adventures clubs that were so popular at the turn of the century.</p>

<p>There will also be a &quot;Guild&quot; formed on Bertoxxolous as part of the
club.&nbsp; It is not a requirement of membership to also be a member of the
in-game guild.&nbsp; The primary purpose of the in-game guild is to facilitate
members talking to one another and finding each other.&nbsp; This can be
particularly frustrating when you are restricted to 25 characters on your
friends list.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is expected that &quot;individuals&quot; will have many characters that
are part of the club [some may also be members of the guild].&nbsp; It is also
possible that we &quot;exploit &quot; Everquest a bit, but we would need their
consent to do so.&nbsp; I will send through an enhancement request on the
subject of temporary guilds for exploration teams.&nbsp; The basic idea is that
for those of us who
do not have a selected guild, it might be possible to form a main guild and two
or three temp ones.&nbsp; Why you
ask??&nbsp; Well,&nbsp; Once a guild
is formed, the &quot;leaders&quot; can add and delete members at will.&nbsp;
So..</p>

<p>If an expedition were being sent to the cold north, they could remove their
characters from the current guild, all be added to the temp one and set
of.&nbsp; that way a party of 15-20 could keep in contact.&nbsp; A bit like an
expedition to the Artic.&nbsp; Just a thought.</p>
