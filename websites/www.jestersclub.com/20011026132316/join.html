<h1>Why join us?</h1>

<p>The Jesters is one of the oldest guilds on the Bertoxxulous server and we have a reputation for having the most fun. We have no level/class/race restrictions and our member list is diverse with a good mix of low, mid and high level players. Our primary goal is to have fun and make friends while skillfully and ruthlessly fighting our foes.

<h1>How to join the Jesters</h1>

<h3>1. Introduce yourself.</h3>
<p>Say hello by posting a message on our <a href="http://boards.gamers.com/messages/overview.asp?name=jestersnews">guild message board</a>.

<h3>2. Get to know us.</h3>
<p>When you are logged in, do a "/who all jesters" and see if anyone is around who is in your level range. Send them a tell and ask if they are available to group with. Then drink some beer, kill some stuff and have a good time.

<h3>3. Let us get to know you.</h3>
<p>Keep playing with us, if you like the Jesters and we like you, then find one person (or more) who will vouch for you and ask them to contact an officer for you. After you have been invited we will let you know what else you have to do to finalize your induction.
