<p>Jenny Jenny who can I turn to,<br>
you gimmie something that I can hold on to,<br>
I know you think that I'm like the others before,<br>
I saw your name and number on the wall.

<p>(Chorus)<br>
Jenny I've got your number,<br>
I need to make you mine,<br>
Jenny don't change your number: <br>
867-5309 (867-5309)<br>
867-5309 (867-5309)<p>Jenny Jenny your the girl for me,<br>
you don't know me but you make me so happy,<br>
I tried to call you before but I lost my nerve,<br>
I tried my imagination but I was disturbed

<p>(Chorus)<p>I got it, I got it, I've got your number on the wall<br>
I got it, I got it, for a good time, good a good time call...<p>**Guitar solo**

<p>(Chorus Al Coda)<br>
Hey!
