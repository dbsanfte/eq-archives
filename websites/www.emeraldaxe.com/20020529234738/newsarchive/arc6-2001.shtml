<p><strong><font size=+1 color="#33aa33">KGC: Shattering Steel Guild</font> </strong><small>Posted
Tuesday, July 10, 2001 by <a href="mailto:Len@emeraldaxe.com?subject=KGC: Shattering Steel Guild">Lenenae McGillicuddy</a></small><br>
Apparently the Karana Guild Council (the group that organizes all the planes and dragon raids) is having a problem with the guild Shattering Steel. SS has basically gone against the KGC rotation and is camping the planes and other major areas out of turn.<br><br>KGC has asked all guilds that belong to the KGC to boycott this guild until they start rotating like everyone else. This means no grouping, no buffing, no reses, no selling/buying, and any other no you can think of.<br><br>I'm not fond of boycotting an entire group for the actions of part of the group, but it comes down to this, the KGC was setup so that everyone gets an equal and fair shake at the major mobs, at least amongst the groups that can take those mobs. It gives an alliance like the Karana Council of Guilds a chance to exist and go to the planes where on other servers you either have to compete with other larger guilds, or you just don't go.<br><br>Given the shear number of guilds behind the KGC I'm guessing that it won't be long before SS gives in and rotates nicely with everyone else. In the meantime I'd like to hear some comments in the forums, unfortunatly the forums for some reason are down right now, but what can ya do, right?<br><br>-Len

Hey all, raid tonight, if you can make it that is. Starting a little early, but I'll have Detryer out by 5PM for rides to West Karana.<br><br>-----Original Message-----<br>From: haemish@mail.com [mailto:haemish@mail.com]<br>Sent: Wednesday, July 04, 2001 10:13 PM<br>To: andyo@ea.com<br>Subject: Vox Up, Time to Kill Her<br><br><br>This email is sent as a service of the Karana Council of Guilds. It is meant to communicate quickly the timing of a Council dragon raid. <br>Alliance of Valiant Blades was unable to get enough to the party to kill Vox on the holiday, so the Council of Guilds gets her on Thursday, July 5th. Please gather in everfrost near the secret entrance to Permafrost keep at or before 8pm EST (5 pacific). Ideally we'll have role call finished and have groups formed and be moving in by 9pm EST, and have her dead and be patting each other on the back by 10:30 or 11pm EST.<br><br>Minimum resistances should be 70 for both Magic and Cold.<br><br>Level requirements are as follows:<br><br>40+ Tanks<br>47+ Int Casters (unless you are an Enchanter with the Mana Seive spell).<br>40+ Healers<br><br>Raid fee is 50pp.<br><br>Good luck, Council!<br>
