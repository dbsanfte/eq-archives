<p align="left">Update: New Project - I'm throwing together a Telnetable BBS, 
right now it's just running your standard run of the mill BBS software, but it's 
super Windows Friendly, was really easy to setup, if it's up you can Telnet into
<a href="telnet://dofp.synchro.net">telnet://dofp.synchro.net</a> to 
connect. If you can think of a better name for it, let me know, Android8675 is 
my username. Gonna try to customize it a bit more, see if I can attract some 
visitors.</p>

<h2 align="center">Days of Future Past...</h2>
<p align="left">This is a quick page I've put up for anyone who happens to 
stumble across it. I came across a couple old
<a title="Look for Spitfire in that page..." target="_blank" href="http://bbslist.textfiles.com/408">
BBS Listing Archives</a> from back in the glory days of the BBS. Back when the 
Internet was in its infancy the BBS reigned supreme.</p>
<p align="left">Back in my day my platform of choice was the Atari 800 and later 
the Atari ST and the Intel 386, the later 2 systems of which I ran a small 
struggling BBS as a hobby on and off around the years of 1990-1992. I was on 
FidoNet with a group from Ben Lomond, we had our own little user group, life was 
good and simple.</p>
<p align="left">I recently acquired several old Atari Systems which took 
me to search for BBS programs I might be able to setup and run over the Net.</p>
<p align="left">I stumbled across the name
<a title="Random Link #1" href="http://www.codehappy.net/pyrzqxgl/pyrzqxgl.htm">
Pyrzqxgl</a> in my
<a title="Google Search: Pyrzqxgl" href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&q=Pyrzqxgl">
search</a>. Don't ask me how, I honestly can't remember how I did it (did not 
directly enter it), and following the link brought on one of the worst 
flashbacks of my earlier BBS days that I've ever had.</p>
<p align="left">
<a title="Oz!" target="_blank" href="http://www.literature.org/authors/baum-l-frank/the-magic-of-oz/">
Pyrzqxgl</a> was/is? a
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.thebbs.org/bbsfaq/index.html">BBS</a> run in 
Santa Cruz County by a system operator named
<a title="Tachyon's Homepages" target="_blank" href="http://www.tachyonlabs.com">
Tachyon</a>. You can read all about it on her pages. Pyrzqxgl was a tree based 
(I think) message system renowned for having some of the most interesting people 
as well as creative people you've ever had the pleasure of not meeting IRL, 
although spend a year or so reading and eventually you might meet some of them 
IRL. I did on a couple occasions as I recall, but I never got too close, 
something I'm kicking myself for not being more outgoing in my younger days.</p>
<p align="left">I went under the name FastBlaster, god knows where I came up 
with that one. I think it was my tendency to be a Video Game Addict (an 
addiction I'm still not cured of to this day) and my stubbornness to stick with something no 
matter how silly..</p>
<p align="left">Now a days I tend to favor Android8675 (Sing it with me...<a title="Jenny Jenny, who can I turn too?" href="jenny.htm">867-5309</a>) 
as an alias. I was using Android9, but I found it hard to make accounts under 
that alias and 8675 is a number no one tends to pick up on, and it's easy as 
hell to remember. Maybe too easy. (Your still humming that song aren't you?)</p>
<p align="left">Anyways, I might add more, like maybe a picture of
<a title="Me and my Niece Claire. (Easter 2003)" target="_blank" href="meNclaire.jpg">
me</a>, or maybe a link to my favorite
<a title="Umm... They don't have BBQ like this in Santa Cruz." target="_blank" href="http://www.saltlickbbq.net/">
restaurant</a>, or
<a title="Ocean's 11 on 8th and Red River." href="http://www.bizjournals.com/austin/stories/2002/05/27/smallb1.html">
tiki-bar</a>. Oh yeah, I'm living in
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.ci.austin.tx.us/">Austin</a>,
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.state.tx.us/">Texas</a> right now. I got a 
job managing a group of game testers and was subsequently fired after less than 
a year for a couple bad judgment calls, but at least I can call myself an
<a href="http://www.msanet.org">Ex-Bitch of Bill</a>. Company was Digital Anvil 
and I was working on a game called
<a title="Wee... Games." target="_blank" href="http://www.microsoft.com/games/freelancer/">
Freelancer</a> for the PC. If you have it, check it out I'm in the Credits.</p>
<p align="left">Looking for work in California as well as Texas now. I'm ready 
to move back! The humidity, king sized roaches and scorpions are starting to 
bother the heck outta me, but other than that Texas is a great area to live in, 
well Austin is at least.</p>
