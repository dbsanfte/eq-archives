Great news everyone I had to take down the web cam, so you can no longer peer into the inner workings of that power house of web gaming EA.com QA.<br><br>I'm sorry, but images of me picking my nose and scratching my bee-hind are no longer yours to oogle over. Apparently Electronic Arts IT department just couldn't fathom the reason for the 6+ web cams around our office area. When they asked for a reason our boss (<a href="http://www.itsjoemama.com">http://www.itsjoemama.com</a>) said, "Because it's fun..."<br><br>EA of course said there was some policy against them, but we couldn't find anything which probably means there will be something at the next update.<br><br>Tune in next week when I shall be broadcasting my cam image from my home system. Plan is to post the cam image on an internal company page just for giggles.<br><br>-Len/AOB

<br>Everyone make sure you say congratulations to <a href="bio/zendakin.shtml">Zendakin</a> and <a href=bio/mananin.shtml>Mananin</a> for their promotions to guild council. They are now available for weddings, parties, and barmitzvas (I so can't spell that). Be sure to give em hell next time you see em.<br><br>The clan calendar is working again, I will have to start encouraging the officers to post events and get togethers.

<br>Got the Rosters correctly displaying, if you wanna make changes or updates, send me an email.<br><br>Roger Wilco is working, if you install Wilco and click on the Main Channel link at the bottom of the menu the program will start and connect you to the "Main Channel", get it?<br><br>So far no one's using this, and I guess I can't blame ya, but if you ever wanna voice chat while playing, Roger Wilco works great. (Even on slow connections)<br><br>Personal Update, my DSL line is down and up, and down, etc. Earthlink sucks. Me and Zondro are gonna get together and party in Neriak this weekend. I'm thinking a party is in order sometime soon, get everyone to EA offices, order pizza, and EQ till we puke. Just an idea.<br><br>Suggestions for the web site are welcomed and encouraged, I'm trying to pick up PHP, I think it may be possible to setup a database so I won't have to modify the character rosters, you can do it yourself, but it's still "in planning" so who knows when it'll go up.<br><br>Thats all for now I guess. See ya when I see ya,<br>-Len

Well, this is more of a test to see what works and what doesn't. Basically, if you didn't notice, you are now on the new EmeraldAxe.com site. I was hoping to get more work done over the holidays, but since my DSL line was moved to Earthlink.net I've been unable to upload anything. So until that's resulved I'll have to find time to update the pages from work, or [Shudder] use dial-in.<br><br>There's a couple pages not yet complete, one is the member section (I have to do a massive find/replace on all the files, looking for an easy way to do it.), another is the Links page (no big loss there), and Clan Voice (since it doesn't work, I'm looking for alternatives, maybe a public server).<br><br>Forums are running OK. I'll be taking requests for email forwarding. If you want to use an email address like Tildar@emeraldaxe.com you can, I'll be asking for sign-ups for these email addresses at a later time.<br><br>Also if you want to add mugshots to your forum postings, send me a 60x60 gif or jpg and I'll upload it to our site and send you the link. Add the link to your preferences in EZBoard, and the mugshot will appear on any EZ Board you post to under that account.<br><br>-Len<br><br>P.s.-Questions? ICQ me at 2103394 or call my cellular at 650-315-8329
