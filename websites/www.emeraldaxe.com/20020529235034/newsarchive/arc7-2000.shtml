<p><strong><font size=+1 color="#33aa33">Wow! Serious Client changes!</font> </strong><small>Posted
Thursday, August 17, 2000 by <a href="mailto:andyo@gamespotmail.com?subject=Wow! Serious Client changes!">Lenenae McGillicuddy</a></small><br>
You are NOT gonna believe this stuff I just copied from Castersrealm.com<br><br>Apparently "Roy", a Verant employee is responsible for the text color changes to the client. In the article posted he goes into information about new upcoming changes that should just rock as far as roleplaying, casting and more.<br><br>Here's the stuff I am looking forward too:   <br>  <br><li>/cast 1-8 for casting memmed spells<br>Casting from Macros! Cool!<br><li>/book # to open your book on page #<br>now all ya gotta do is get the spells sorted out.<br><li>/sit<br>Easier acting<br><li>/doability # (so if you have tracking set on ability button 1, then /doability 1 would invoke tracking)<br>/e kicks @ in the nuts<br>/doability 2 (kick)<br><li>More control of certain text message colors, the spell and target being mentioned in the "casting" message <br><li>Custom emotes that include the target name (/em gives @ the look of death and @ is frozen in his tracks would replace the '@' with the current target) </li><br><br>The other thing I'm looking forward too is the possibility of changing from 6 by 6 slot quickkeys to 4 by 8 slot, and possibly adding the ability to Ctrl-1 to 8 to cast spells. Oh happy day.<br><br>-Len<br><br>AMAZING NEW CHANGES, AUGUST 16, 2000 <br>Source: Everquest General Forum.<br><br>My name is Roy, and I am a Senior Programmer on the EQ Live team. My main focus for now is the client program including the User Interface. <br>Some of the first things I've done are now live and I've seen the many reactions to them. I've been reading the boards and even implemented some of the suggestions already (they will go onto test tonight or tomorrow). <br><br>Be aware that while I am reading the boards, I can not respond to everything. I will read what I can, and respond when I can. If I were to spend the time needed to reply to everything, then I would not have any time to code the changes and fixes needed. My boss would not be too happy with me, if that were the case... <br><br>Hopefully, we can work together to make the UI as good as it can be.<br><br><i>Spells being hot keyed. I'm wondering if that might be possible. For example, a shaman might right click some of his/her buffs into his/her hotkey lower left 6 pad. That way he/she can cast these from the book, essentially, expanding the real estate of those ever-important 8 spell slots. Casting from the spell book, even at 3x the casting time, has been dismissed as impossible to implement, though perhaps I wondered if a workaround might be to hotkey the icon into the presets so that excessive spell-swapping is reduced. Some classes are more effected by the 8 spell limitation than others, and as the spells accumulate toward level 60, this just worsens.</i><br><br>Having more then 8 spells from your spell book available to cast at any one time is not part of EQ and unlikely to change.<br><br><i>I'd just like to suggest that, along with some of the other default options that are being tested out right now, that you also insert the option to turn /log on or off by default.</i><br><br>Log control has been added to the eqclient.ini file already, should be on test soon.<br><br>Just as a reminder, I am primarily working on the UI, I won't be addressing issues such as class balance and problems with quests or items  Here's an update though:<br><br><li>Using activatable items from the hot button panel is in and should be on test. I'm looking into why the hotkeys don't operate from a key press while in the spell book. <br><li>Looking into the Ctrl-1 thru Ctrl-8 for memmed spells. <br><li>The main issue with selecting party members pets with the F keys is that the client doesn't currently track the info. I will look into it and see if this can be done. As usual, no promises. <br><li>Looking into the shift click while buying to buy stacks of 20. One thing to keep in mind, if you don't have enough money for all 20 it will just cancel the sale. This will only work on stackable items. <br><li>When emoting, the text of the emote YOU typed used to be blue. But when others saw it, it was white. Similarly, when you saw other's emotes, they were white. Now all emotes are the same color.</li><br><br>I had to make "classes" of text, and in order to keep it from being a separate color control entry in the ini file for every text message printed (meaning hundreds of entries) I had to group stuff together. I thought it made sense to put all emotes into a class together. This reason applies to a lot of the messages.<br><br><i>With my color User_11 RGB as specified in Gordon's file, full red only, the text is still WHITE on messages where others are hitting me. This is probably just a bug.  Wasn't the duel color (User_14) yellow?</i><br><br>Some of the messages are sent from the server with a color tag, I have already fixed most of these and it should be on test.<br><br><i>Was all spell activity really dark blue? I must be losing my marbles, that seems wrong.</i><br><br>See my response above.<br><br><i>When you do a /who friend all, your friends list comes back white, rather than the color of all other friends queries (again, likely just a bug).</i><br><br>The "local" /who command is handled by the client, the "/who all" commands are all handled by the world server. Those will be colored properly soon. <br><br><i>How about letting us right-clink on potions and items with effects that are in an open backpack (you can only use a charged item that is in a general invent slot)?  Or letting us hotkey slots that are in backpacks.</i><br><br>Either of these would help a ton, if you have 8 bags/large items in your general slots it becomes very annoying to swap around your Jboots for a quick recharge.<br><br>Just a note, hotkeying a backback slot is just not possible.<br><br>Couple things I wanted to address: <br>Cancelling a spell you already cast and having to wait until the casting time is done is part of the game. If you click the wrong spell you have to wait... <br><br>I doubt I will be able to increase the number of hot-buttons per page above 6 pages of 6 buttons. It would change the player data format stored on the server, and that could cause serious problems with character data. <b>I might be able to make it 4 pages of 9 (still having a total of 36 buttons, just more available at a time).</b> I am still investigating this one.. I'll let you know what comes up. <br><br>Several of the other things asked for here are either in or going in this week. Like: <br><br><li>/cast 1-8 for casting memmed spells <br><li>/book # to open your book on page # <br><li>/sit <br><li>/doability # (so if you have tracking set on ability button 1, then /doability 1 would invoke tracking) <br><li>More control of certain text message colors, the spell and target being mentioned in the "casting" message <br><li>Custom emotes that include the target name (/em gives @ the look of death and @ is frozen in his tracks would replace the '@' with the current target) </li><br><br> and more... some of these are on test already, and some will be there later this week.<br><br><i>What kind of answer is "Cancelling a spell you already cast and having to wait until the casting time is done is part of the game." I have seen many things that were "part of the game" that were altered to suit to the players needs and requests. To me that like telling a warrior once you start attacking a mob you can't stop until X amount of time has gone by before you can take another action.</i><br><br>It more than an inconvenience, you cannot pick another target, you cannot switch thru your hotkeys, you have to run around sometimes to keep the spell from going of and sometimes it will still go off. I have never known an RPG that did not allow for you cancelling or stopping a spell or ability that is not an instantaneous affect. <br><br><i>Then you turn around and say you are making these other changes for casting spells and hotkeys, makes it sound like a double standard to me.</i><br><br>Just to reply to the people that didn't like my reply about stopping spells.<br><br>It's part of the game. If you click the wrong spell, it's a penalty that you have to wait thru. I'm sorry that it's not the way you would like it, but there have to be drawbacks to making mistakes. And I realize that sometimes it's not a mistake so much as the situation changing after you cast. <br><br>I play a caster, and I would like to make this change, also, but it's just something I have control over. The designers of the game want it this way.<br><br><i>I know you stated:  "The main issue with selecting party members pets with the F keys is that the client doesn't currently track the info. I will look into it and see if this can be done. As usual, no promises." <br><br>Abashi has stated this as well, but many know this to simply not be true. I have seen Show in action (don't use it myself because in my opinion takes half the fun out of the game), and this does track a pet to it's owner. Since the program just sniffs packets it can't do any of this on it's own. Meaning that pets are indeed tracked with their owners. If anyone tells you otherwise, check it out for yourself.</i><br><br>I am familiar with ShowEQ, and how it does it's pet stuff. The pet does have the ID of it's owner in it's packet, but player packets don't have the ID of their pet. What needs to be done is that the client needs to search the current mob database for any pets that belong to people in the current party. For your own pet it does this when you create it. The client also needs to keep updating this info as your party changes and as your party members create and destroy pets (either via pet spells or charm).<br><br>Again, ShowEQ is just going thru it's entire database and when if find s a pet it sticks it under the pets owner, but as I've explained above it's not the same as tracking the pets for the functionality asked for in this thread. That said, I still plan to look into this feature because I think it would be useful. <br><br><i>In the higher resolution modes 1024x768 for example when I'm in full screen with the display in transparent overlays, there's a huge amount of wasted space in the text box.  Is it possible to either allow the characters to go the full width of the box and add extra lines of text display?  Or at least shrink the box and remove the extra spaces between the lines to remove the amount of the screen it blocks out?</i><br><br>Regarding the text box in higher resolutions.<br><br>One of the other programmers here is working on that right now. It's not as simple as one might think at first glance because users can and do switch modes back and forth (sometimes they are forced to by the game itself like for inventory mode), and thus the text needs to be "re-wrapped" for the narrower box when in that mode, and then expanded back out when you return to the higher res fullview. It's almost working though and should be on test later this week. <br><br>Three suggestions that have been drifting around a bit for the spell books: <br><br><li>A first and last page button would be great! <br><li>User customizable tabs/bookmarks would be an awesome improvement <br><li>Being able to duplicate spell icons (related to above suggestion) would be amazing: Why? So we can plan out different 'load outs' or whatever for our spells for different situations (i.e.: group section, ungrouped section, travelling section...)  Certain spells will invariably be in all 'configurations' (not sure if I'm being clear here...) <br><li>Thanks for the colour customization! That was great....except I managed to make mine worse hee hee...but eventually I'll have my own perfect scheme.</li><br><br>I am working on a /book command that will bring up your book, I plan to allow you to specify a page number with that and have it pop open on that page. So /book 5 would open the book with page 5 visible. This should allow you to get to any page in your book easily. <br>Duplicate spells icons in the book is not an easy thing, I'll peek at it, but doubt it will get done.<br><br><li>Would it be possible for you to make it so we can have the GUI overlays in 800x600 and 1024x768 Full screen? Maybe through an optional download? I imagine these files are BMP files and the size of a 1024x768 BMP would be pretty large, but it would help a lot.. Some people like to play with the GUI on and in high resolutions.</li><br><br>Part of the GUI overhaul for Velious will likely involve something along these lines, but because of the new art and data changes for that it won't be until Velious. <br><br><i>It would be cool if guild masters and maybe officers could set a text message that is stored server side and played back to guild members whenever they log on to EQ. Here's an example:- <br><br>Welcome to EverQuest!<br>Message of the Day: [The usual EverQuest message of the day in yellow text]<br>Guild Message of the Day: [Tindi'Losi] Reminder - Fear raid on Monday, insertion starting 0900 EST at Feerrott portal! Also, everyone please welcome your new guildmate Xyzzy, a level 34 druid who joined us yesterday. <br><br>This would be a very effective way for guilds to communicate, post reminders, make important announcements etc. Right now, whenever there's an important announcement people struggle with /guildsay and web boards, and 48 hours later half the guild still hasn't heard it. <br><br>It would also be cool to have a /guildmotd command that would play back the message on request at any time. <br><br>A guild "message of the day" would be a great addition to the guild functionality of EverQuest</i><br><br>I am going to look into this one, I think it's a great idea. I will say this though, it seems like it might be easy at first glance, but it's not a trivial thing to add new data to be stored on the server and delivered to select users. <br>Anyway, I'll see what I can do. <br><br>A little thing that would make things a lot smoother for me anyway, are more keyboard shortcuts/hotkeys for those of us who use the keyboard and the mouse. <br><br>For instance, in inventory when I open up a backpack, and am done with it or realize it's not the right one and want to close it, it'd be nice to just press and have it close rather than have to click it. Same thing for trades and such. Using to confirm the trade and to cancel would be nice. <br><br>Also, more pages for hotkeys would be nice... Maybe 10 (0-9) pages instead of just 6 (1-6). <br><br>Lastly, and this may go into gameplay a bit, but a second rack for memorized spells would be nice. After a few levels, there are often MANY different spells at your disposal and only 8 slots to memorize them to. The number of spells is a selling point for the game, so why not make it to where you can use more of them. Maybe make it so that you get more mem slots every few levels... Make them work kind of like the aforementioned pages of hotkeys... Maybe + 0 can toggle between the spell lists, or if it's not used for anything. *SHRUG* Besides, it will still take a good while to mem all those spells initially, so it shouldn't be too unbalancing.<br><br>I like the idea of using and for more things, but it can also cause problems. For example, since you can chat while trading I can't make confirm the trade since you might just be hitting to end your line of chat. Same for you might just be cancelling a chat line. However, I plan to try and add more keyboard shortcuts for thing where I can. <br>I am already looking into the "more hot button pages" idea. <br><br>Having only 8 memmed spells is part of EQ and changing that is highly unlikely to happen. I won't say never, because one should never say never, but think of it like that.<br><br>'You must be standing in order to cast a spell'. Why don't we automatically stand up whenever we hit a spell icon? It doesn't seem to make any sense that we have to manually stand and then cast a spell. If I click on a spell button, then I wanted to cast a spell so standing should happen automatically. <br>From a precedent setting perspective, if we are attacked by a mob while sitting we automatically stand.<br><br>I'll ask about this at the next tuning meeting. While I don't see a problem with it, there may be reasons I am not aware of that would stop us from doing this. <br>- Rowyl<br> <br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>(c) Casters Realm, 1999-2000.

<p><strong><font size=+1 color="#33aa33">Big Patch Day!</font> </strong><small>Posted
Thursday, August 10, 2000 by <a href="mailto:andyo@gamespotmail.com?subject=Big Patch Day!">Lenenae McGillicuddy</a></small><br>
Check this patch out! New Dragons, New things in the Emerald Jungle (don't forget to Kunark Patch), and much much more. Apparently you can change text colors in the client to whatever you want them to be!<br><br>Enjoy,<br>-Len<br><br>***Character Purge***<br><br>Time has come to do some cleanup on character data across the servers.  On August 23rd (Pacific), we will be doing a system-wide cleanup of level 1 characters.  All level 1 characters that have not been played within 30 days from the date of the purge will be deleted.  As GMs will not be able to restore any characters that are deleted, please be certain to log in any level 1 characters that you wish to keep prior to the purge.<br><br>- The EverQuest Team<br><br><br>August 9th, 7:00am<br>------------------<br><br>*Guide Application*<br><br>The Guide Application is now back up at <a href="http://guideapp.everquest.com.">http://guideapp.everquest.com.</a>  If you are over 18 years of age, have a good customer-oriented attitude, enjoy helping your fellow player, and are interested in joining the Guide Program, we will be pleased to review your application.<br> <br>*Kunark Users*<br><br>A new file, emeraldjungle_chr.s3d, is included as part of today's patch.  This patch adds additional displayable NPCs to the Emerald Jungle.  Please run the "Kunark Patch" by pressing the "Kunark Patch" button on the bottom of the patch program UI prior to entering EverQuest.<br><br>*Patch Day*<br><br>Greetings everyone! Today's patch contains some exciting new changes. <br><br>*General Enhancements*<br><br>- Text messages that wrap will be indented on subsequent lines. This means that if a person or NPC says something that is more than one line long, all subsequent lines will be indented a few spaces. This should make it a lot easier to pick out separate messages.<br>- The spells "United Resolve" and "Heroic Bond" had their levels transposed accidentally.  Rather than putting them back as intended, United Resolve has been changed to Heroic Bond, which means you might have two copies of that spell in your spellbook.  Feel free to move one to the back.  Clerics get a new group spell at 58 to compensate.<br>- The Wurmslayer is now a one-handed slashing weapon.<br>- The /help command will now list all /-commands available to you.<br>- Rangers, Paladins, and SKs now have mana equivalent to that of a pure caster with the same stats.  This will give those hybrids a good deal more mana, regardless of their stats.<br>- NORENT items, items that disappear when you log out, will now show a "NORENT" tag when inspecting the item.<br>- Most summoned items now have the word "summoned" in their name.<br><br>*Changes/Fixes*<br><br>- Small Studded Tunic recipe now works<br>- Scaler recipe now works<br>- High Elves can now use the Moss Covered Twig and Branch<br>- Iksar can now wear the Crescent headband.<br>- The Shintl Lowbrew quest will now work<br>- The Rusty Rapier now looks like a rapier.<br>- Elven Wine can now be brewed<br>- Some pelt-dropping animals were always dropping ruined pelts, rather than pelts of quality.  This has been repaired.<br>- The Guild-invite toggle in display options will now work.<br>- The faction problems with the Charasis Key Quest have been resolved.<br>- Many pathing errors have been repaired.<br>- Repaired a bug that caused some anomalies after being charmed or feared.<br>- Repaired a bug that kept the Unswerving Hammer of Faith and Flaming Sword of Xuzl from disappearing.<br><br>*Dragons?*<br><br>Rumor has it that some new dragons have been spotted in Kunark. It should be noted however that the dragons can be engaged from much further away than is intended.  Rather than hold off implementing these dragons for another week, we've decided to implement them now and fix the problem in the next patch.  Enjoy :)<br><br><br>*New Command For Tracking*<br><br>New option for those with tracking: /trackplayers. The command will work for all players with the tracking skill.  The command has two settings:<br><br>- ON: Default setting, same as it is now.  Players will show up in the tracking window.<br>- OFF: Players will not show up in the tracking window.<br><br>*Client Customizations*<br><br>Upon starting EverQuest, a new file (EQCLIENT.INI) will be created in your EverQuest directory.  This file contains customizable settings for:<br><br>- Colors for text messages in the in-game chat window<br>- Default screen viewing mode<br>- Default travel speed (run or walk)<br><br>The documentation will be included in the online manual in your EverQuest directory once the design is finalized over the next several weeks, but the working document is posted below.  We felt that people would rather have access to the customizations right away while we're in the process of building them.  <br><br>Modifying this file is optional.<br><br>*EQCLIENT.INI documentation*<br><br>The [TextColors] section contains entries for various text colors in the client. All colors are to be set with Red, Green, and Blue values, in decimal. Valid settings for each color range between 0 and 255. "Black" (0 red, 0 green, and 0 blue) will be white in overlay mode, and black in normal mode. <br><br>Here is a list of user colors to use as a guide when editing the file: <br><br>1 - Say<br>2 - Tell<br>3 - Group<br>4 - Guild<br>5 - OOC<br>6 - Auction<br>7 - Shout<br>8 - Emote<br>9 - Spells (meming, scribing, casting, etc.)<br>10 - You hit other<br>11 - Other hits you<br>12 - You miss other<br>13 - Other misses you<br>14 - Some broadcasts (duels)<br>15 - Skills (ups, non-combat use, etc.)<br>18 - Default text and stuff you type<br>20 - Merchant Offer Price<br>21 - Merchant Buy/Sell<br>22 - Your death message<br>23 - Others death message<br>24 - Other damage other<br>25 - Other miss other<br>26 - /who command<br><br>The [Defaults] section contains some default setting for the client. Here is a list of valid settings: <br><br>RunMode - TRUE for run, FALSE for walk.<br>ScreenMode - NORMAL for the default window view, FULL for the full view with overlays<br><br>- The EverQuest Team

I just tried this program and found it quite cool, it's a log phraser or whatever you call em, with a couple nice features I think you'll enjoy. It runs in Java2, and was a bit tricky to setup, so I'd thought I would add a couple things to make it easier to run.<br><br>First thing you will need to do it install Java2 from Sun for Windows. Of course if you are on a Mac, what's the point? Go to:<br><br><A HREF="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/jre/" target=_blank>http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/jre/</a><br><br>Once you have Java setup, get the EQInfo file from <A HREF="http://hermes.spaceports.com/~clanea/EQInfo_0_4.zip">here</a>, unzip the to files and run the shortcut to start the program.<br><br>It tracks skills and will also monitor servers amongst other things. <br><br>Enjoy,<br>-Len

Yes, a patch to combat scammers and improve roleplaying! Hopefully the servers won't be down too long this morning. ;)<br><br>August 1st, 7:00am<br>------------------<br><br>**Patch Day**<br><br>Greetings everyone!  <br><br>Today's patch contains some changes that we are sure everyone will enjoy:<br><br>- Canned emotes (e.g. /point) now work on NPCs.  In addition, the range for canned emotes has been increased.<br>- /who all "guildname" should now work for players who have /roleplay turned on.<br>- Preferences for the mouselook will be saved in your options file.  Those who turn mouselook off each time when starting EQ will only have to do it once more.<br>- The "Chat Filter" tab in "Options" now has an option to filter messages caused by damage shields hitting others.<br><br><b>*Fast Drop*</b><br><br>Our most exciting change today is an option that allows players to avoid accidentally dropping items on the ground.  The new client allows players to set "Item Dropping" preferences on the "General" options tab.  The three options that can be set are:<br><br>- FAST DROP: Items are dropped without confirmation.<br>- CONFIRM: A confirmation box will be displayed whenever you try to drop an item.<br>- NEVER: You are not allowed to drop items on the ground.  <br><br>Alternatively, you can also set these options using the /fastdrop command.  The arguments are:<br><br>- ON: Same as option "Fast Drop" on the General Tab.<br>- OFF: Same as option "Confirm" on the General Tab.<br>- NEVER: Same as above.<br><br>Please note that whatever your setting, coin will always be dropped without confirmation.  Additionally, the FastDrop option only applies to items being dropped upon the ground.  Handing items to NPCs will still work regardless of your FastDrop setting.<br><br>It is highly recommended that you use option "CONFIRM", as GMs will not reimburse any items that are accidentally dropped.<br><br>- The EverQuest Team
