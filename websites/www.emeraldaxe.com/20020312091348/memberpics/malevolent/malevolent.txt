[Tue Aug 21 19:50:18 2001] You say, 'What might I do for thee Arch Priest N'Keth. I am yours for the time being.'
[Tue Aug 21 19:50:33 2001] Dorvias N`Keth says, 'Only a true follower would be able to weild this idol, a false follower will know immediate death from it's touch... take this idol from my hands and hold it within your own'

[Tue Aug 21 19:55:01 2001] Dorvias N`Keth says, 'I pleaded with Lanys to end it then and had she any courage or honor for the Teir'Dal to face this "Fate" as written by the Gods'
[Tue Aug 21 19:55:04 2001] Scout Ziana grimaces in distaste at Lanys' name.
[Tue Aug 21 19:55:28 2001] Nugraboluk is confused by all the words.

[Tue Aug 21 19:56:03 2001] Dorvias N`Keth says, 'Of course, being the stubborn child she was, she refused to do so... the end result inescapable... Lanys did fall and her death came..'

[Tue Aug 21 19:57:51 2001] Nugraboluk tells you, 'Yeah'
[Tue Aug 21 19:57:59 2001] Nugraboluk dislikes funerals.
[Tue Aug 21 19:58:27 2001] Genive would love to see her corpse delivered to the Queen.
[Tue Aug 21 19:58:27 2001] Dorvias N`Keth says, 'However, the evening after the battle... Lanys' corpse was kidnapped'
[Tue Aug 21 19:59:15 2001] Dorvias N`Keth says, 'We believe this came from the likes of the Primordial Malice, a group who even in her death remain loyal to Lanys'
[Tue Aug 21 19:59:39 2001] Kanael frowns.
[Tue Aug 21 19:59:45 2001] Scout Ziana says, 'they are fools tothis day...'
[Tue Aug 21 20:00:00 2001] Nugraboluk agrees with Scout Ziana.
[Tue Aug 21 20:00:00 2001] Dorvias N`Keth says, 'The rogue you encountered this evening was sent forth to find out where and by whom her corpse was being held'
[Tue Aug 21 20:00:21 2001] Nugraboluk tells you, 'they were right about by whom but not where, right?'
[Tue Aug 21 20:00:23 2001] Cadash holds a lightstone over his head in realization.

[Tue Aug 21 20:01:33 2001] You say, 'Finally, some action.'

[Tue Aug 21 20:01:43 2001] Kalushan tells you, 'lol, that long?'
[Tue Aug 21 20:01:43 2001] Dorvias N`Keth says, 'Cadash, are you willing to perform an act in Innoruuk's name and for Neriak itself?'
[Tue Aug 21 20:01:47 2001] You told Kalushan, 'they are sending us somewhere in a moment.'
[Tue Aug 21 20:02:00 2001] Scout Ziana peers at Cadash, looking him up and down.
[Tue Aug 21 20:02:02 2001] Kalushan tells you, 'by foot or by tp?'
[Tue Aug 21 20:02:07 2001] You say, 'I will Dorvias. For our Lord and for your honor.'
[Tue Aug 21 20:02:17 2001] You told Kalushan, 'foot.... still in neriak now.'
[Tue Aug 21 20:02:24 2001] Dorvias N`Keth nods once in approval.
[Tue Aug 21 20:02:25 2001] Kalushan tells you, 'i pitty you yet i envy you'
[Tue Aug 21 20:02:27 2001] Nugraboluk will accompany Cadash.
[Tue Aug 21 20:02:31 2001] Kanael can't shake his doubts about the human.
[Tue Aug 21 20:02:47 2001] Dorvias N`Keth says, 'Listen carefully to what I tell you now Cadash, your very life shall depend upon it'
[Tue Aug 21 20:02:48 2001] Cadash thanks Kanael and Nugraboluk.
[Tue Aug 21 20:03:04 2001] Dorvias N`Keth says, 'Ziana, come forward child'
[Tue Aug 21 20:03:19 2001] You told Kalushan, 'Yeah, my life is depending on this next part... eek. :)'

[Tue Aug 21 20:03:39 2001] Scout Ziana says, 'Yes, Lord Dorvias'
[Tue Aug 21 20:03:55 2001] Kanael sees not a child.
[Tue Aug 21 20:04:10 2001] You say, 'figure of speech Kanael... shhh.'
[Tue Aug 21 20:04:14 2001] Dorvias N`Keth says, 'Cadash, this is Scout Ziana, she will aid you during a portion of your task. Do not for a moment question her abilities, for there are no higher skilled beings ... anywhere'
[Tue Aug 21 20:04:17 2001] Kanael chuckles.
[Tue Aug 21 20:04:24 2001] You nod.
[Tue Aug 21 20:04:32 2001] Scout Ziana bows.
[Tue Aug 21 20:04:40 2001] You say, 'I am in your service Ziana.'

[Tue Aug 21 20:04:44 2001] You bow before Scout Ziana.
[Tue Aug 21 20:05:00 2001] You emote 'nods in acknowledgment.'

[Tue Aug 21 20:05:21 2001] Dorvias N`Keth says, 'Befallen is where Lanys' corpse is being held.'
[Tue Aug 21 20:05:45 2001] Nugraboluk worries about Befallen.
[Tue Aug 21 20:05:54 2001] Scout Ziana says, 'Lord Dorvias.... isnt that where....'
[Tue Aug 21 20:05:56 2001] Dorvias N`Keth says, 'You will find her corpse guarded, and if my assumptions are correct, it will be by the likes of Baron Telyx'

[Tue Aug 21 20:06:17 2001] Scout Ziana says, 'The Baron knows my face, Lord'
[Tue Aug 21 20:06:25 2001] Cadash eyes Nug and mouths the words Baron Telyx...
[Tue Aug 21 20:06:42 2001] Nugraboluk shrugs and pretends to understand.
[Tue Aug 21 20:07:04 2001] Kanael nods and is glad of his ability to appear as other races.
[Tue Aug 21 20:07:04 2001] Dorvias N`Keth says, 'Baron Telyx was once a devout Teir'Dal warrior of Innoruuk who fell to Lanys' favor sometime past, when The Destruction began.'
[Tue Aug 21 20:07:27 2001] You nod at Dorvias N`Keth.
[Tue Aug 21 20:07:37 2001] Genive would Cadash need the help of others to make his way to this traitor Baron Yelyx.
[Tue Aug 21 20:07:48 2001] Dorvias N`Keth says, 'Make no mistakes Cadash, the Baron is not to be trifled with, but is a fool nonetheless'
[Tue Aug 21 20:08:10 2001] You say, 'I understand Dorvias.'
[Tue Aug 21 20:08:30 2001] Cadash welcomes Genive's, and others help.
[Tue Aug 21 20:08:49 2001] Kanael says, 'though i only be of 14 seasons i shall help all i can'
[Tue Aug 21 20:09:07 2001] You say, 'Only 2 less than myself Kanael.'
[Tue Aug 21 20:09:21 2001] Dorvias N`Keth says, 'You must enter Befallen with the aid of your companions and retrieve the Ornate Ring that at one point was on Lanys' corpse. IT may or may not have been removed from her lifeless body'
[Tue Aug 21 20:09:22 2001] Kanael says, 'aye. then we shall go'
[Tue Aug 21 20:09:49 2001] Scout Ziana says, 'Be silent while the lord speaks'
[Tue Aug 21 20:10:10 2001] Tendara says, 'well, if only of 14 seasons you may need the help of others stronger than yourselves.'
[Tue Aug 21 20:10:12 2001] You say, 'Hummm... How will I locate her corpse Dorivas, or do you think it simply on display for everyone to see?'
[Tue Aug 21 20:10:21 2001] Scout Ziana has a dangerous glint in her eye.
[Tue Aug 21 20:10:23 2001] Dorvias N`Keth says, 'Lanys' body should be being kept somewhere on the first floor of Befallen'
[Tue Aug 21 20:10:38 2001] Dorvias N`Keth says, 'allow me to finish Cadash and all shall come to be known by you and your companions'
[Tue Aug 21 20:10:57 2001] You emote 'nods in an appologetic fashion.'
[Tue Aug 21 20:11:23 2001] Dorvias N`Keth says, 'Her corpse will most likely be under guard by the Baron himself'
[Tue Aug 21 20:11:42 2001] You tell your party, 'you don't have to come, just inviting you all, don't suicide yourselves... :)'
[Tue Aug 21 20:11:52 2001] You tell your party, 'we'll think of something on the way.'
[Tue Aug 21 20:12:14 2001] Scout Ziana says, 'I fear I must remain outside, else the Baron would know me, and know you as with  Innoruuk'
[Tue Aug 21 20:12:21 2001] Nugraboluk tells the group, 'DOH'
[Tue Aug 21 20:12:24 2001] Dorvias N`Keth says, 'we cannot pinpoint her exact location due to the ward that has been placed on the corpse by the Primordial Malice to keep the wizards of The Spurned from scrying.'
[Tue Aug 21 20:12:25 2001] You agree with Scout Ziana.
[Tue Aug 21 20:13:29 2001] Dorvias N`Keth says, 'Scout Ziana will escort you to Befallen, but will not enter because of the zealots of T`Vyl will surely kill her on sight.'
[Tue Aug 21 20:13:41 2001] Tnayil says, 'Hail, Dorvias N`Keth'
-Tnayil = level 1 Enchanter = idiot, but he served my needs, got stiffed on the reward too :(
[Tue Aug 21 20:13:45 2001] Dorvias N`Keth says, 'THis is the most important part Cadash, listen carefully'
[Tue Aug 21 20:13:48 2001] Tnayil says, 'OMG NICE ROBE'
[Tue Aug 21 20:14:01 2001] Scout Ziana turns an icy glare upon Tnayil.
[Tue Aug 21 20:14:06 2001] Scout Ziana says, 'Silence....'
[Tue Aug 21 20:14:15 2001] Nugraboluk looks angrily at Tnayil and is ready to eat him.
[Tue Aug 21 20:14:29 2001] You say, 'Snacks later Nugraboluk.'
[Tue Aug 21 20:14:41 2001] Kanael thinks he wouldn't do much to satisfy Nugraboluk's hunger.
[Tue Aug 21 20:14:44 2001] Tnayil tells you, 'what is this?'
[Tue Aug 21 20:14:56 2001] Dorvias N`Keth says, 'You and your companions must convince the Baron that you are there to pay your respects and mourn the fallen Lanys. '
[Tue Aug 21 20:15:26 2001] Scout Ziana smiles.. beginning to understand...
[Tue Aug 21 20:15:43 2001] Dorvias N`Keth says, 'You will need to come up with some creative tale and convince the Baron to not only allow you to view and mourn Lanys, but also to give you the Ornate Ring.'
[Tue Aug 21 20:16:04 2001] Nugraboluk will struggle to be sneaky.
[Tue Aug 21 20:16:28 2001] You tell your party, 'everyone remember the story, were there to mourn the dead Lanys...'
[Tue Aug 21 20:16:49 2001] Dorvias N`Keth says, 'The Baron will be looking for a trap believe me, use your words carefully with him. He must believe that you love Lanys even in death and have travelled to mourn her'
[Tue Aug 21 20:17:16 2001] Scout Ziana says, 'He can do it, Lord, he seems clever.'
[Tue Aug 21 20:17:17 2001] Dorvias N`Keth says, 'Fail in this and you will surely fail and meet the same fate as those that have attempted this task before you'
[Tue Aug 21 20:17:23 2001] Cadash slicks his hair back.
[Tue Aug 21 20:17:41 2001] Nugraboluk rubs his stomach.
[Tue Aug 21 20:19:17 2001] Genive says, 'Our leader will not fail in the task with us by his side'
[Tue Aug 21 20:19:17 2001] Nugraboluk says, 'Nugra go too.'
[Tue Aug 21 20:19:26 2001] Scout Ziana peers at Nugraboluk, looking him up and down.
[Tue Aug 21 20:19:30 2001] You say, 'Any advice that would convince the Baron of our "mutual" love?'
[Tue Aug 21 20:19:39 2001] Scout Ziana says, 'I think Nugra should let Cadash do talking'
[Tue Aug 21 20:19:39 2001] Dorvias N`Keth says, 'I suggest you band together'
[Tue Aug 21 20:19:44 2001] Scout Ziana grins evilly at Nugraboluk.
[Tue Aug 21 20:19:54 2001] You say, '..but let me do the talkin. :)'
[Tue Aug 21 20:20:07 2001] Dorvias N`Keth says, 'YOu seem clever enough Cadash, surely deceit is not something new to you'
[Tue Aug 21 20:20:30 2001] You say, 'Well... interesting story...'
[Tue Aug 21 20:20:37 2001] Cadash looks at his watch...
[Tue Aug 21 20:20:48 2001] You say, 'but I think time is not something we have the luxury of right now.'
[Tue Aug 21 20:20:53 2001] Dorvias N`Keth says, 'Go now, time is of the essence. Scout Ziana will lead you to Befallen and assure your safe arrival.'
[Tue Aug 21 20:20:56 2001] Kanael says, 'let's be off then'
[Tue Aug 21 20:21:03 2001] You say, 'Lead on Ziana...'
[Tue Aug 21 20:21:04 2001] Dorvias N`Keth says, 'Go in Hate'

[Tue Aug 21 20:50:03 2001] Baron Telyx says, 'Fool! The Dark Lady would never make such promises to any male, let alone a human. If she had a "need" she fulfilled it, if perhaps you were that filling one evening, surely she was dillusional'

[Tue Aug 21 20:55:45 2001] You say, 'a Teir'Dal Rogue told me... I came across his dying body in the Oasis near here. He wore and Ebon Mask and spoke that her corpse was here. the fool actually thought I would help those of Neriak retrieve the ring. Instead I vow to retrieve what's...'

[Tue Aug 21 21:00:55 2001] You say, 'I gladly seek to prove of our bond. What is this test you speak of?'
[Tue Aug 21 21:02:06 2001] Cadash motions for Nug to give the Baron some room.
[Tue Aug 21 21:02:21 2001] Baron Telyx says, 'You have stated a closeness with Lanys, is this correct? A bond so close that a union between you both was talked about.. am I correct in this assumption?'

[Tue Aug 21 21:03:13 2001] Baron Telyx says, 'Then tell me human, what was the Dark Lady seeking to complete prior to her demise?'

[Tue Aug 21 21:08:39 2001] You say, 'I regret being away from my love as she fought in the faydarks, the lord of fear sent minions to attack the church of the dismal rage. I was called to my compatriots side. I had only wish I could be there as Lanys made her final push. Alas, it was...'
[Tue Aug 21 21:09:12 2001] You say, 'weeks before I had even heard of her demise. Then to hear that her corpse was taken from the field...'
[Tue Aug 21 21:09:32 2001] Baron Telyx says, 'Her final push to what Cadash? Answer my question!'

[Tue Aug 21 21:11:19 2001] Tnayil tells the group, 'the destruction of all elfs but her own kind!'
(Tnayil kept tossing out ideas, was getting annoying)
[Tue Aug 21 21:11:27 2001] You tell your party, 'no he's gonna say something long and kill us, I know it.'
[Tue Aug 21 21:11:31 2001] Kanael tells the group, 'LOL..i'm 40 years old and been thru Real life. what's to sweat about ;p'
[Tue Aug 21 21:11:42 2001] Baron Telyx says, 'One who suggests what you do surely must know what Lanys was trying to gain, why even a mere follower would know the answer I seek. You seem to be anything BUT that!'
[Tue Aug 21 21:12:57 2001] You say, 'The destruction of the Fier'Dal was her ultimate goal.'
(I'm an idiot)
[Tue Aug 21 21:14:07 2001] Baron Telyx says, 'You disappoint me Cadash, surely even a fool who was trying to deceive me would've made certain of his facts before attempting to do so...'

[Tue Aug 21 21:14:26 2001] Baron Telyx says, 'So, in essence you know nothing, or so, you have shown me.'

(I can't believe I said it)
[Tue Aug 21 21:15:04 2001] You sigh at Baron Telyx.
[Tue Aug 21 21:15:35 2001] Baron Telyx says, 'What I understand is that you are evading my question and thinking the fodder you are spewing to be the answers I seek, you are quite wrong'
(Being REALLY generious right now)

[Tue Aug 21 21:16:59 2001] Baron Telyx says, 'You wish to pay homage to Lanys, to mourn her, to view her holy corpse. Even if I could deliver such to you or any, you have not shown me any reason whatsoever to allow you and your companions this right'
[Tue Aug 21 21:17:35 2001] Baron Telyx says, 'All you have done was serve as a jester thus far, and my amusement with you grows thin'

[Tue Aug 21 21:18:36 2001] You say, 'I seek only the ring on her hand and to say goodbye, know not how else to convince you. Do with us as you will then. Turn us away.'
[Tue Aug 21 21:19:14 2001] You say, 'We all have a great love for the woman she was and shall carry her name to the grave.'
