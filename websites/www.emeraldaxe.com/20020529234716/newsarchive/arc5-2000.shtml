<I>(Len- I took this from <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com" target=_blank>EQVault</a> today)</i><br><br>Gordon started an interesting new thread on PvP. Here's the complete post from the Gameplay Board:<br><br>I often get email from a few folks who make some very good arguments concerning risk in PvP. Basically, the standpoint is that if the environment does not contain risk, there is no sense in engaging in it. "Item loot" itself does not handle this risk, as players of casting classes are not affected to the same extreme as melee characters. <br>One argument is that we should implement experience-loss in PvP. I like this idea, unfortunately some core issues with the way life in EQ works makes implementing this unreasonable. For anything that couldn't be handled in code, an additional load would be placed on the CS staff. Believe it or not, even though people playing on PvP servers should be more tolerant of interaction with other players, 90% of the petitions there are for some kind of perceived harassment. <br><br>The core EQ system, meaning, the things that define EQ as EQ, do not allow some of these issues to be resolved without drastically changing the PvE portion of the game which we want to remain intact.<br><br>That said, I still firmly believe that some form of risk associated with PvP needs to be in game. Since that risk cannot be experience-based, and item-based risk doesn't hurt people who can bag their items or fight without them, I'm considering the following option: Making it so that everyone, regardless of class, can only bind in cities on the PvP Servers only.<br><br>City-only binding (again, on PvP servers only) would allow people to, for instance, eject an opposing force from a zone, and provide the additional risk of making all of them run back to recover their corpse and engage again. <br><br>What are your thoughts on this? Do you feel that PvP needs more real and equal risk associated with it regardless of class? <br><br>-Gordon<br><br><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/056704.html" target=_blank>Click here</a> to go to this thread.<br><br><i>(Len- I like...)</i>

Tuesday, June 20, 2000 by <a href="mailto:andyo@gamespotmail.com?subject=Vallon Zek Invasion!">Lenenae McGillicuddy</a></small><br>
Yo! In case any of you "Care-Bear" players haven't noticed, the Clan has invaded Vallon Zek in FORCE!<br><br>Zondro, Lenenae, and Jagak have made the switch to a less friendly server and would like to put out an open invitation to other clan members to come over to the dark side!<br><br>So far here is our line-up:<br><br>Soultres - Lv. 10 Dark Elf Necro<br>Nhandunfluncun - Lv. 8 Dark Elf Mage<br>Basharaluga - Lv. 8 Dark Elf Necro<br><br>Were evil, so if you plan to come over, try to start up a Dark Elf, Ogre, Troll, or Iksar as this comprises the "Dark" Team, and basically the most organized team on the server. The other teams consist of:<br><br>Hummies - Humans, Barbarians, Erudites<br>Elfies - Half-Elfs, High-Elfs, Wood-Elfs<br>Shorties - Gnomes, Dwarfs, Halflings<br><br>The Darkies easily outnumber all three of the other teams combined, and for that reason a lot of the other teams "combine" their efforts to thwart our presence, but usually fail. It's actually quite a fun game with the added danger of some dwarf team running up and trying to knock you to Brell's embrace.<br><br>Imperium of Z - is a Dark Team Guild on VZ which we've joined as we all quickly found out that's it's good to have lots of friends on this server. The guild is pretty open, just tell an officer (/guildstatus <playername>) that Soultres is a friend and you like to run around and have fun and you'll probably get in.<br><br>Reasons to come over to PvP-Teams:<br><li>Bored with camping</li><br><li>Would love to be able to teach that dwarf a lesson or two.</li><br><li>Don't have enough friends in the game (People are easier to rally together towards common goals and thus are usually more friendly, at least, those that are on your team).</li><br><li>Need a reason to run around naked (If someone PKs you it's coin + 1 item loot. You'll never want to have an oracle robe for as long as you play, unless someone else is wearing one. :)</li><br><br>Reasons to not come over:<br><li>You believe that all races should co-exist, peacefully.</li><br><li>You actually like camping items for 6 hours, only to have some punk come over and demand rotation immediately. (At least you can kill him on VZ so he can't get the rotation.)</li><br><li>You dislike dying. (You should be used to it by now)</li><br><li>You whine about dying instead of quietly biding your time for when you can get revenge.</li><br><br>There's more, but that's all I can think off, offhand. It's a lot of fun, if ya wanna give it a shot I'd really like to see a Female Troll Shaman or Warrior. We could also use an Enchanter for stealth missions into Freeport for supplies. Drop me a line if ya have any questions.<br><br>-Len

Saturday, June 17, 2000 by <a href="mailto:andyo@gamespotmail.com?subject=*Patch Day*">Lenenae McGillicuddy</a></small><br>
nothing too interesting:<br> <br>June 15th, 8:00am<br>-----------------<br> <br>*Patch Day*<br> <br>Hello everyone,<br> <br>Over the past few weeks, a portion of the EQ team has been working on The Hole, in preparation of its release in the near future.  Even so, a number of changes and additions were made in today's patch.  Most of the changes are in regards to quests:<br> <br>- The "Fleshy Orb" quest has been completed<br>- We've received word that "Fabian" has been spotted somewhere on Norrath.<br>- Froglok Foragers and Hunters should been seen more regularly.<br>- Lord Grimrot should be seen more frequently.<br>- Skill in tailoring is no longer required to craft The Robe of the Lost Circle.  <br> <br>A few items have also been changed this week:<br> <br>- The Robe of the Lost Circle has been enhanced.<br>- The Staff of Temperate Flux and the Rod of Insidious Glamour now have a short casting time associated with their activatable effect (See Below).<br>- The Gunthak Harpoon is again NORENT, meaning that it will disappear when you log off (See Below.)<br> <br><br>*Casting Times on Staff and Rod*<br> <br>We received word a few weeks ago that some people were using these items to "spam" other players with their spell-effect messages, causing them to disconnect.  Though /ignore will allow you to filter out text messages caused by people on your /ignore list, it will not allow you to filter out spell-effect messages for spells cast upon you.  <br> <br>The short casting time should prevent the problems associated with the targetable and activatable effect on these weapons, however you will have to stand still to use them now.<br> <br>*Gunthak Harpoon*<br> <br>In the last item patch, we made the mistake of making this weapon "rentable", meaning that it does not disappear upon logoff.  Basically, one of our game designers heard that the weapon was NORENT, concluded that it must be a bug, and took the initiative to fix it.  Unfortunately, the stats on this weapon, despite its disadvantages of weight and its non-magical composition, make it much too powerful for its location and difficulty in obtaining it.  <br> <br>For these reasons, the weapon is once again NORENT, and will disappear the next time that you log out.  This is a retroactive change and will affect weapons already in possession.  We do apologize to those who acquired it within the last week expecting that it would be a permanent weapon.<br> <br>*Chat / Login Process*<br> <br>The Chat and Login server components are now completely separate, meaning that players will no longer have difficulty logging in due to an excess of people in the chat server.<br> <br><br>- The EverQuest Team<br> <br>

Taken from the EQ Message Boards:<br><br>This morning I was handed a list of spell changes that didn't make it into the patch message. I'll put up an addendum later today, but here's the list for review: <br><br><li>Banshee Aura has had its duration increased. <br><li>Scale of Wolf and Spirit of Scale will no longer be canceled by being the target of a melee attack. Ranged attacks and spells will still cancel the spell. <br><li>Shaman can now cast Charm Animal <br><li>Some enchanter and shaman spells have had their casting times/mana costs altered. <br><li>Augment, Glamour of Kintaz, Rapture, and Clarity II have had their mana cost lowered. <br><li>Root spells that cause damage (Druid roots, Hungry Earth) now work properly. </li><br><br>- Gordon<br>

Wednesday, June 7, 2000 by <a href="mailto:andyo@gamespotmail.com?subject=*Patch Day*">Lenenae McGillicuddy</a></small><br>
*Patch Day*<br><br>Greetings! The live servers have been updated to reflect the newest data on the Test Server:<br><br>*General*<br><br>- Some new spells are available for the hybrid classes. Check your Kunark spell vendors.<br>- Found and corrected a problem causing people to fall to their deaths upon zoning. The majority of these issues should no longer occur.<br>- Corrected outstanding issues with several quests, including the Brain Bite, Shackle of Rock, and the Barnal Flamehands quest.<br>- Increased treasure in many Kunark zones including The Emerald Jungle, Sebilis, and the Frontier Mountains.<br>- Upon review we've increased the drop-rate of level 51+ spells in Kunark. They should be more plentiful now. <br>- Updated pathing information in many zones, making it easier for pets and other NPCs to get around the zones.<br><br>*Items*<br><br>- A problem with the spell effect for the Luminary Two-Handed Sword. Current owners of this weapon will need to contact a GM to trade their sword out for a working one.<br>- The Gunthak Harpoon is now rentable. It will remain in your possession when you leave the game.<br>- A couple pieces of Blood Ember armor have been reduced in weight.<br>- Reduced the weight on several Monk weapons found in Kunark.<br><br>*PvP Teams Servers (VZ/TZ) and Illusions*<br><br>Due to an outstanding bug that allowed a player to permanently mesmerize or stun opposing team members when coupled with an illusion, illusions will now automatically cancel when the person wearing the illusion casts an offensive spell upon any player-character. Players should keep this in mind before attacking with spells in an area where their faction standing is less than desirable. <br><br>Illusions are defined as any spell that makes a character look different than they actually are. This includes all racial illusions, as well as other illusions such as Treeform, Wolfform, and the Call of Bones series. <br><br>*Risk and Reward*<br><br>The concept of risk and reward is very important to the game of EverQuest. Ideally, situations that provide a greater reward should also provide substantial risk. Over the past several weeks, we've been identifying areas in game where risk and reward are at a disparity, and making necessary adjustments. <br><br>In most cases, those adjustments are in favor of increasing the reward for a specific action. For example, we recently increased the experience awarded in many Kunark zones to offset the sometimes-considerable risk associated with adventuring there. We also do this quite frequently by increasing the reward associated with a quest by enhancing the item, as we did last week with the Burning Rapier quest. <br><br>However, in some cases there are instances where reward is far in excess of the risk involved, and we will be correcting these issues like those above as we come across them. For example, there are many cases where a solitary and stationary outdoor creature has a "fast spawn", yielding the reward of fast experience-gain without the commensurate risk. <br><br>Though it is not our policy to announce changes to individual NPCs, we did want to let you know that you will see risk/reward disparities corrected over the next several weeks.<br><br>*PvP Teams (VZ/TZ) Character Transfers*<br><br>As many people playing upon the PvP-Teams servers are aware, Vallon Zek and Tallon Zek have different rules regarding looting rights from PvP combat. Vallon Zek allows the victor to loot all coin plus one item from the fallen, whereas Tallon Zek allows only coin-loot with no right to loot items.<br><br>Due to the fact that the looting rules were changed on Tallon Zek post-production, we've decided to allow characters on both servers a one-time character-move. Registration for the move will open at 6:00pm PDT on Friday, June 9th, 2000, on both servers, and will be open through 12:00pm PDT on Monday, June 12th, 2000. You can register for the move by executing the "/movelog yes" command during the registration window. There is no limit to the number of people that we will allow to move between Tallon and Vallon Zek, so there is no reason to rush to enter the command.<br><br>Please remember that once you register for the move, your decision can not be rescinded. The actual character-move will take place sometime next week, at a time to be announced later. Please keep in mind that corpses are not moved in a character-move, so we'd recommend against leaving unclaimed corpses around after Monday of next week if you've asked to be moved. <br><br>Questions about the move process will be addressed in the Gameplay Message Forum available via www.everquest.com.<br><br><br>- The EverQuest Team

Greetings X-Fans, your resident mutant Lenenae has been busy tweaking out the site here and there. <br><br><li>You'll notice that except for the "Home" Page link I've removed the Java logo at the top of the screen. I am considering doing a "Flash" logo once I get a new copy of Live Motion.<br><li>I am considering bring back the Conan the Barbarian music that I love so much, of course I'll have to twink the site a bit so there's little load time and it doesn't stop while you are surfing around the site. I think it'll work.<br><li>I replaced the Calendar from a free site with ads to a free CGI program that I downloaded, the good news is that we can administer it from the members area, and is much nicer looking. The down side is that it takes a while to load, gotta be patient with this one. If the page fails to load, hit back and try again, sometimes <A HREF="Spaceports.com" target=_blank>Spaceports</a> just times out or something.<br><li>I am still adding characters to the roster. It's not that adding them takes a long time, it's that I am really not motivated to do it unless I have a picture and complete information for the character from the characters owner. I honestly believe that if ya wanna be up there, prove it. I'm even considering removing our leader unless I get a picture of him wearing something other than that god awful Robe of the Elements that he's had since level 20-ish.</li><br><br>That's probably it for now.

This was too important not to post here. :)<br><br><H2>Sony Acquires Verant</H2><br><b>Industry: Sony Pictures Entertainment has acquired online games company Verant Interactive and named Kelly Flock, former President of 989 Studios, as president and CEO of Sony Online Entertainment.</b><br><br><br>Verant will be merged into SOE as part of SOE's effort to concentrate on becoming the premier attraction for interactive gaming. The developer is already acclaimed for EverQuest, Tanarus and Sovereign. Verant President John Smedley will remain with SOE as executive vice president and COO. <br><br>Flock will supervise the development of new games by SOE and Verant, and will oversee SOE's website, the Station@sony.com. <br><br>"Flock is perfectly suited to build on Sony Online Entertainment's leadership position and lift it to new levels of excellence," said Howard Stringer, chairman and CEO of Sony Corporation of America. "With his great talent and creativity, we're delighted he will continue to work in the extended Sony family." <br><br>"I continue to believe that online gaming is the fastest-growing, most exciting area of interactive entertainment," Flock said. "It is a great honor to be able to rejoin the pioneers at SOE and the EverQuest development teams, under John Smedley's direction at Verant, in furthering our goal of facilitating the next evolution in games. Sony Online Entertainment has the edge in technology and content, and I am excited by the opportunity to create and lead the next mass-market category of gaming." <br><br>The company has moved its headquarters from New York to San Diego, where Flock will be based.<br><br> <a href="http://www.fgnonline.com/news/13847.html" target="_blank" >http://www.fgnonline.com/news/13847.html</a>
