<br>OK, this could be good, and it could be bad.<br><br>I was able to setup a really nice Roger Wilco server today, and I integrated it into our web site for easy access. You'll notice the link on the left to the <a href="/~clanea/rogerwilco.shtml">Clan Voice</a>, I put up a quick page there with basic setup instructions to get you talking on the net, <i>fast</i>.<br><br>All you need is a microphone connected to your microphone port (it's the red jack on newer sound cards), and be connected to EQ. The voice takes "minimal" bandwidth. It's supposed to work fine even on a Slow Modem connection, although I haven't extensively tested it yet.<br><br>If you feel like hearing exactly what Lenenae sounds like, try signing on to the main channel.<br><br>/e crosses fingers...<br><br>If I didn't get it right, post something on the forums and let me know.<br><br>-Len

Well, looks like Verant testing strikes again. You know if they hired the EA.com team this stuff would NOT happen, period. It's secondary patches like this that reaffirm my belief that Verant does all their testing on the live servers.<br><br>November 16th, 8:00am<br>------------------------------<br><br>*Follow-up Patch*<br><br>Today's follow-up patch addresses the following issues from yesterday's patch:<br><br>- The spell Torpor received an unintentional reduction in effectiveness<br>- Illumination in game was not as bright as it should have been.<br>- Pet using classes unintentionally gained the ability to summon multiple pets.<br>- Bard songs were reacting poorly with invisibility/hide/sneak.<br>- Hitpoints were being reported incorrectly to clients.<br>- Changing resolutions would cause some to crash.<br><br>In addition, the following changes were left out of yesterday's patch message:<br><br>- Fixed a bug that would cause some to not be able to cast after being feared.<br>- Data for group members and targets will be updated more frequently.  This change should reduce complaints of warping and slow hitpoint and other updates.<br>- Bards received increases in the skill cap for their instrument skills.<br>- Changed the default combo for casting spells from CTRL-1:8 to ALT-1:8, as CTRL was interfering with players ability to strafe.<br><br>Thank you for your continued patience.<br><br>- The EverQuest Team<br><br>(Bah!)

<br>Yeah!!!<br><br>November 15th, 3:00am<br>------------------------------<br><br>***Patch Day***<br><br>Today's patch includes the announced code-updates to use technology included with DirectX 7.  You MUST have DirectX 7 or higher installed in order to play EverQuest.  Please refer to <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/f_requirements.shtml">http://everquest.station.sony.com/f_requirements.shtml</a> prior to contacting technical support for procedures prior to contacting technical support.<br><br>Today's patch also includes the new "Sound Engine" that we've been speaking about for some time.  The new sound engine supports additional EAX features and should address the concerns of SBLive users that have been posted in the past.<br><br>*Movelog for Povar and Tarew Marr*<br><br>The /movelog window will be opened for Povar and Tarew Marr on Saturday 11/18 and Sunday 11/19 from 6PM PST (GMT-8) to Midnight.  All players wishing to have all of their characters moved (on a per-account basis) from those servers to the new split-server should execute "/movelog yes" during the windows.<br><br>The physical character move will take place next week on Tuesday or Wednesday.  Please check the scheduled downtime page of www.everquest.com for a firm time when it is decided.  Remember that corpses will not follow you to the new server, so anyone deciding to move will want to be sure that all corpses are looted prior to the time of the actual move.  <br><br>As this patch features new /movelog logic to eliminate problems with people being left behind, players should not count on customer-service intervention after the physical move if they were unable to execute the command during the window.  You will need to be present and execute the command in order to move.<br><br>*Spell Changes*<br><br>-- Pixie Strike: Made it less resistible by reducing the secondary resist.<br>-- Song of Twilight: Increased duration. Made less resistible by removing the secondary resist. Allowed it to be cast at any time of day.<br>-- Fixed the effect on the Necromancer Epic Quest Item.  The effect was checking resist on each tick instead of running full course.<br>-- Increased the duration of the effect on the Enchanter Epic Quest Item.<br>-- Fixed the "Modulating Rod" so that it can be used by the appropriate races.<br>-- Fixed the Lost Staff of the Scorned<br>-- Maniacal Strength will now correctly overwrite the level 49 strength spell.<br>-- The Death Pact and Divine Intervention spells will now stack appropriately with other spells that have similar effects.<br><br>-- Modified the "Jonathan's" line of songs to remove the "skin" effect in order to allow bards to use them more effectively in combat.  In addition, we made them "Self Only" spells rather than "Single Target" spells in order to allow bards to remain in combat while singing them.<br><br>*General Fixes/Changes*<br><br>-- Fixed a bug that caused an NPC on "Sister's Isle" to attack people who were fighting pirates.<br>-- Removed Paladins as an authorized class for piercing weapons in game since they do not have the piercing skill.<br>-- The "Belt of the River" quest should now work correctly.<br>-- Fixed all known problems with the class-specific epic quests.<br>-- Implemented some new race-specific quests for Iksar.<br>-- Positively modified most Epic Quest Items.  Please check your items to see your changes.  Note:  Not all changes will be evident by looking at the item.<br>-- Fixed the NPC bosses in the Plane of Sky that were not dropping the correct loot.<br>-- Your bread tin will now be returned when baking bread.<br>-- Fixed the Wellford Fargin keyword problem in Firiona Vie.<br>-- Made the "Gravebinder" a magic weapon.<br><br>-- Repaired the Forager Bag.  It was causing people to lose weight when placing items in the bag.  It is supposed to have a weight reduction component, but was not supposed to cause weight loss.<br><br>-- Taunt: Increased effectiveness above level 50.  Previously, creatures above level 50 could not be taunted by means of the taunt skill.  Now, most creatures below the character's level can now be successfully taunted.  As a note, the chance to taunt a creature above 50th level is smaller than that of a creature below 50th.<br><br><br>*Client Enhancements*<br><br>-- You now have 10 pages of 10 hotboxes each when in full screen mode.<br>-- You can now customize 10 pages of 12 socials each, increasing the total number of available socials by 108.<br>-- Fixed a bug with the keyboard.txt file causing some keys to translate incorrectly.<br>-- Fixed a bug that caused some window positions to save improperly at higher resolutions.<br>-- All key mappings are now stored in the EQCLIENT.INI file.<br><br>-- Fixed all known problems with the clipping plane slider.  Users should now see differences for the entire range of adjustment in zones that support an adjustable clipping plane.<br><br>-- Players on PvP servers will no longer show "[LD]" over their heads when linkdead.  In addition, these same players will no longer show as "LinkDead" in the /who list.<br><br>-- Players can now set custom text colors while in game.  /usercolor:  Usage "/usercolor UserColorNumber R G B" where "UserColorNumber is the number of the color as indicated in the EQCLIENT.INI file, and R, G, and B are red, green and blue respectively.  All changes will be automatically saved to your EQCLIENT.INI file.<br><br>-- OPT files in your EverQuest directory now have a number after the character name indicating the server number.  As such, you will now be able to have characters of the same name on two separate servers with different custom options.<br><br>-- The eqlog.txt file now has a name that includes the server number and character name.  For instance, if your character is named "Bobb", and you are on Server 1, your log text file name would be eqlog_01_Bobb.txt.<br><br>-- Added two new entries to the "Defaults" section of the EQCLIENT.INI file:  AttackOnAssist=TRUE|FALSE - Sets whether or not your autoattack turns on automatically when assisting.  Defaults to "TRUE".  ShowInspectMessage=TRUE|FALSE - Sets whether or not you see the "Soandso is inspecting you" message.  Defaults to "TRUE".<br><br>-- Custom key mappings have been greatly enhanced.  You can now set two keys, a primary and an alternate, for each function in game.  In addition, things that were previously not customizable can now be set to a key of your preference.  Left-click on the key identifier to set the primary key, right-click to set the secondary.<br><br>-- Added the /note command.  /note will append the following text to a file called "notes.txt" in your EverQuest directory.  For instance, typing "/note This is a note" will put "This is a note" on the next line in the notes.txt file.<br><br><br>- The EverQuest Team

<br>Wow, I can't believe it, I'm like a Cleric possessed by Innoruuk himself! (Or is that Iccoununai?)<br><br>Anyways, I finished the Clan Roster. Well, that is to say I finished converting it over to a nicer format. I had to do everyone's records by hand, what a pain.<br><br>Anyways, now that I'm on top of it and feeling quite proud I'll probably go through all your emails that you sent to <a href="mailto:clanea@travel.to">the <a hred="mailto:clanea@travel.to">Clan Mailbox</a></a> over the past few months and fill in the rest of it.<br><br>Yes, I will take corrections for the next few weeks, I suggest you post them to the Forums. Also, while you are at the forums, here's a couple things you can do to help out with getting the web site all caught up.<br><br><li>I need all active members to start regular postings on the message boards. I realized that there are a lot of names on the Members list that I don't recall seeing online in recent months. I don't plan to remove anyone from the list, just move them to a "Former Members" Category. This may take some time.</li><br><br><li>I need to get everyone's contact information in case I need to get in touch with you and keep you up to date on what's going on.<li><br><br>I will be starting a message board topic tonight. Please try to post a reply as soon as you can. <br><br>When you sign up for the ezboard you have a choice of making a Global or Local account. If you make a local account you can only post on the Emerald Axe board. If you make a global account you can post to any ezboard with that login/password.<br><br>That's all for now I guess...

Apparently I've been possesed by the web demons. Yes, I've been coding HTML all week between games of Silent Death and anything else coming down the pike at <a href="http://www.ea.com" target="_blank" >EA.com</a><br><br>The new forums are up, I'm deleting the old ones to save room. I'm also looking for a place where we can store images that can be used on the ezboard forums. Basically there's an option to add your mugshot or custom graphics to signatures, or whatever. Unfortunatly Spaceports.com will not allow graphics from their servers be served up on other web pages.<br><br>Could someone let me know if there's a internet file storage place where the files can be accessed from other locations. For instance, putting a picture on www.here.com and making a homepage on www.there.com with the image displayed on the page.<br><br>-Len
