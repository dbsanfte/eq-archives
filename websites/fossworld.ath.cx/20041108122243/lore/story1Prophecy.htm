      In the <a href="Tome_of_ages.htm#The Elder Age">Elder Age</a> the
      <a href="trolls.htm">trolls</a> followed one god: <a href="cazicthule.htm">
      Cazic Thule</a>, their creator. They grew and evolved under his guidance, 
      and the blood of Fear beat strong through their hearts. The unity of the
      <a href="trolls.htm">trolls</a> was broken when <a href="innoruuk.htm">
      Innoruuk</a>, the Prince of Hate, touched a young <a href="trolls.htm">
      troll</a> mystic named Zraxth.<br>
      <br>
      Zraxth's deviation from the followers of <a href="cazicthule.htm">Cazic 
      Thule</a> was small at first. He would gather small groups of other 
      mystics in secluded camps far away from the <a href="trolls.htm">troll</a> 
      cities. There they would perform ceremonies to channel their hatred, and 
      through it give power to the trolls who were being oppressed by the 
      dominant forces of the Rallosian armies. Hatred drove the trolls, making 
      them more bloodthirsty and savage, but their might was still not enough to 
      confront the will of the <a href="ogres.htm">Ogre</a> Empire that 
      dominated Southern <a href="tunaria.htm">Tunaria</a>. Zraxth saw that his 
      efforts were futile, and asked his new lord, <a href="innoruuk.htm">
      Innoruuk</a>, when the trolls would see the power they were promised. The 
      knowledge he sought came with a price; <a href="innoruuk.htm">Innoruuk</a> 
      demanded a blood tithe in exchange for a vision. Zraxth was instructed to 
      slay the high priests of <a href="cazicthule.htm">Cazic Thule</a> so their 
      blood could be used to grant him foresight.<br>
      <br>
      Zraxth and his followers did as the <a href="innoruuk.htm">Prince of Hate</a> 
      demanded. Cloaked by the night, he and his disciples crept into the camps 
      of their brethren and killed every elder priest to yield the blood to be 
      used in the rite. The blood of their kin on their hands, Zraxth and his 
      disciples set about performing the rituals described in Innoruuk's 
      instructions. A great stone tablet was brought before Zraxth, and the 
      ceremony began. Zraxth meditated for days without sleep or food, trying to 
      transcend his mortal mind and see what <a href="innoruuk.htm">Innoruuk</a> 
      had promised him.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Bookman Old Style"><br>
      On the eighth day, Zraxth spoke. The disciples tried in vain to record his 
      words but found that no ink would hold them; the words ran like 
      quicksilver off their parchments.. Zraxth, still in a deep trance, took 
      the stone and began to record his words with the elder's blood and a 
      chisel made from their bones. As he laid each symbol into the stone, it 
      blazed with dark flames and then settled. As the stone cooled, the 
      disciples saw that the words appeared as though they had always been a 
      part of the stone, rather than carved and painted into it.<br>
      <br>
      Zraxth's visions foretold the coming of the Grozmok. The Grozmok would be 
      the greatest of all <a href="trolls.htm">trolls</a> and would unite the
      <a href="trolls.htm">troll</a> clans through Fear and Hate. Through his 
      knowledge of war and magic he would topple the empires in
      <a href="tunaria.htm">Tunaria</a>. The stone would be the symbol of his 
      power. No true Grozmok would rise without the stone, but many false 
      Grozmoks would die because of it. This was the prophecy, the curse and the 
      legacy of Grozmok.<br>
      <br>
      The ceremony killed Zraxth. His body was burned, and his ashes were 
      scattered. His disciples returned to their tribes, each assuming their old 
      positions among the mystics, teaching their people of the prophecy of 
      Grozmok. Zraxth's first disciple was given the stone, as his tribe was the 
      strongest and most likely to give rise to the Grozmok. They protected the 
      stone and its secrets for many generations, until whispers of the prophecy 
      spread to the Rallosian Empire. <br>
      <br>
      The <a href="ogres.htm">ogres</a> did not fear the <a href="trolls.htm">
      trolls</a>; however, they did fear the power that the stone might grant 
      them. To stifle any hope that the stone may have provided, they raided the 
      home of the tribe that held the stone. After slaughtering all who lived 
      there, they returned the stone to their vaults, attempting to end the 
      prophecy and any power that may have been drawn from it.<br>
      <br>
      The stone remained in the fortified strongholds of the Ogre Empire until 
      the curse of the Pantheon struck the minions of Zek down for their hubris. 
      The fall of the empire created a void of power in Southern
      <a href="tunaria.htm">Tunaria</a>. The two largest <a href="trolls.htm">
      troll</a> factions, Clan Broken Skull and Clan Ykesha, began to battle for 
      rule over the once conquered lands. As their war raged, knowledge of the 
      stone faded from the trolls' minds. It lay forgotten, until marauders from 
      Clan Ykesha found the stone hidden in the vaults of a decimated ogre 
      fortress. The lore and memory of the stone's true meaning had been long 
      lost to the <a href="trolls.htm">trolls</a>; still they recognized the 
      stone as an artifact from their ancient history, and presented it as a 
      tribute to their clan leader, Warlord Ykesha.<br>
      <br>
      The ancients of Clan Ykesha eventually managed to translate the writing on 
      stone; this revealed the lost prophecy of the Grozmok to them. Warlord 
      Ykesha took his capturing of the stone to mean that he was destined to be 
      the Grozmok. Rumours of the stone spread throughout the Clans. Meanwhile, 
      the power of Clan Ykesha grew as other tribes joined them to fight for the 
      Grozmok.<br>
      <br>
      <a href="innoruuk.htm">Innoruuk</a>, seeing the hate among his children 
      fade as more and more joined Ykesha, planted seeds of doubt in the 
      Warlord's mind. Ykesha grew reclusive, moving deep within his compound to 
      protect himself from attempts to usurp his power. This growing insanity 
      weakened him. As dissention grew within Clan Ykesha, other clans grew bold 
      and struck the might of the Ykesha. It was Clan Broken Skull that managed 
      to finally overthrow Ykesha and lay claim to the stone.<br>
      <br>
      The remnants of the Ykeshan clan regrouped slowly, rising under the might 
      of Warlord Jurgash, and formed Clan Grobb. The new clan grew under the 
      direction of Ykesha's descendent, while the stone remained hidden on 
      Broken Skull Rock. <a href="innoruuk.htm">Innoruuk</a>, again seeing the 
      hate among the <a href="trolls.htm">trolls</a> settling, granted one of 
      Grobb's mystics a vision that revealed the location of the Grozmok stone. 
      Clan Grobb invaded Broken Skull Rock and recovered the stone. The 
      victorious clan returned the stone to Southern <a href="tunaria.htm">
      Tunaria</a>. <br>
      <br>
      Today, the Grozmok stone rests hidden and well protected deep within
      <a href="grobb.htm">Grobb</a>. Knowledge of the stone and the prophecy it 
      contains has once again begun to fade as new generations pursue their own 
      dreams of power. The young consider the old stories of the stone and the 
      first great warlord, who rests in his fortress now swallowed by the swamp, 
      to be campfire myths. Yet, many of the clan elders wait with the hopes 
      that one day the Grozmok will rise from their ranks and fulfill the legacy 
      of Ykesha.<br>
