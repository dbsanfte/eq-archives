It was with great trepidation that I was summoned into the presence of King
Ak'Anon.  What could he want with me?  Was he angry about that spider trap I
had been experimenting with?  No, that couldn't be it.  The damage has been
cleaned up, and my assistant's wounds are healing nicely.  Was it the
exploding fishing bait I was testing in the lake?  Maybe.  The waves it
generated did inundate parts of the city, but only temporarily, and they did
wash away a bit of grime.  Perhaps I should use a smaller amount of
Firewater...<P>

As I entered the throne room, I paused to admire perhaps the greatest
achievement of Gnomish Tinkerers - King Ak'Anon himself!  By constructing
him, we freed ourselves from the day-to-day drudgery of running the kingdom,
and can now devote our attention to more important matters, like that
exploding fishing bait.  Maybe it isn't the Firewater, maybe it's the...<P>

"BZZZT-TIK!  Pasketti!  CLIK!  I have summoned you here because I believe
you may be able to help.  WHIRRRRR!"<P>

Oh yes!  I forgot where I was...<P>

"How may I help, Sire?"<P>

"PING!  It seems that many throughout the land are having problems editing
their INI files to correctly set text colors.  CLANK!"<P>

"Sire?  I don't understand.  It's simplicity itself.  Set User_15_Red to 0, 
User_15_Green to 0, and User_15_Blue to 128 to make your skill messages come
out in a pleasing dark blue color."<P>

"PTING!  Yes, yes, to us it is.  WHIRRR-CLICK!  But to those that haven't
been blessed with keen Gnomish minds adept at tinkering, it can be
confusing.  TICK!  Therefore I task you, Pasketti!  BZZZZZT!  Create a way
to allow everyone to configure their text colors!  TICK-PTING-WHIRRR!"<P>

"Yes, Sire!  I'll get right on it!"<P>

I returned to my workshop posthaste, and have crafted this program.  It's so
simple even an Ogre can use it.<P>
