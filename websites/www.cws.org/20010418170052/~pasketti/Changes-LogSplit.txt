Version 1.0

Initial Release

Version 1.1

Deleting the original file now moves it to the Recycle Bin.

Program now saves the file name that you last split, since this
  will almost certainly wind up being EQLOG.TXT every time.

Version 1.2

Program now detects manually turning on the log, and starts a new
  file when it detects it.

  Thanks to Healani Goodheart of the Order of Concord for
  assistance and log files to fix this.

Added "Zone Time" parameter to adjust for people who take longer
  to zone.  Default is 75 seconds, which should be adequate.

Version 1.3

Added ability to split multiple files.

Now gets default character name from the file name, if it's of
the pattern eqlog_XX_Charname.txt that EQ now produces.

Added auto-delete input files option.

Version 1.3.1

Added "EQ Log Files (eqlog*.txt)" option to file selection box.
