Understands /played times with 0 days/hours/minutes

TOO MANY COLUMNS!  Moved Critical Hits/Crippling Blow/Thunderous Kick/
  Deadly Strike damage from the various "Damage Output" reports to new
  "Special Damage" reports.
Paladin AA ability "Slay Undead" now tracked on "Special Damage" reports.

  is no longer produced, and hasn't been for some time.

  information in a clearer and easier to use fashion.
Now processes merchant price quotes with no periods correctly.
Character options now automatically set to the current character.
The price on the "Merchant Items Bought" report will now reflect the

  I hope.
Under some circumstances (mainly lag), mobs will continue to hit you

Removed the "Rerun" button and menu option, as it is no longer needed.
Now tracks the "YOU are INVULNERABLE!" from Divine Aura. Thanks, Celaeno.
Changed "Options" menu setting to read "Program Options" instead.

  to run all the reports will still be collected and saved in the data file,

"Stuns" added to Damage Taken and Mob Damage Output reports, to show how
  often you got stunned, and how often mobs stunned you.

  zone you encountered them in, how many times they were killed, gate 
  attempts, flurries, enrages, etc.

  into 27 different reports, divided by the first letter of the item
  name, plus an extra for the non-alpha names.  Makes it easier to find
  stuff.

  haven't been seen in 6 months, they don't get listed.

  Attacker Master." as pet taunt.
Fixed bogus strike-but-miss messages you get when zoning.  Was ignoring
  -ALL- strike-but-miss messages, now just ignores the bogus ones.
Fixed problem with Ranger bow crits.  When the mob hit was too far away
  for the damage message to be seen, crits were not being recorded
  correctly.
Reports that you've marked as not to be saved via the "Save All" option
  are no longer saved - bug introduced last version.
Skills now saved in EQLog.INI file in [Charname-Skills] section, allowing

TOO MANY TABS!  Instead of all the report tabs being accessable from the
  main screen, they are grouped under the new "General", "Damage",
  "Benchmark", or "Pets" tabs on the bottom.  This reduces screen clutter.
Program no longer slows down drastically as it processes more and more
  data.
Now understands "My leader is Soandso." for pet tracking, in addition to
  "my leader is Soandso".
Added small amount of style information to HTML reports to make it use
  10-point Arial font, which is a bit smaller.
Fixed problem with program bombing if there is garbage in the log. I hope.
Added global merchant data file so that merchant data can be shared between
  characters.  It's a text file, so you can even share data with other
  players by appending their files onto your own.

  quite a bit.

  there are no "Soandso saved." lines in the logs.

  checking of extra "Soandso saved." lines.
Moved the "Messages" box to one of the report tabs to make better use of
  screen space.
Added "Deaths" report, to tell you how, when, and where you died.

  in empty table cells.  Made a BIG difference in the report size.
Added "Other Damage Output" and "Other Damage Taken" reports, that list
  the total damage done/taken by other players or mobs, not just yours.
You have to be using version 4.70 of the MS Common Controls DLL.  The
  program has always had this requirement, but now it checks for it.  This
  is only a problem if you're running Windows 95 or NT 4.0, and have NOT
  upgraded to IE 3.0 or later.  I don't expect this to affect anyone.
Added "Fishing by Zone" report.
Removed merchant inventory from the "Merchant Items Bought" report, and
  added it to the new "Merchant Inventory" report.
Changed exception file name to incorporate the character name, if known.

  reported in the "Misc" and "Level Stats" reports.

  equivalents that have spaces in them.

  to ignore them.

  to the [SaveReports] section.
