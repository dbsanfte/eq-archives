Version 0.9

**        Data file format has changed      **
**   Data files will need to be recreated   **
** You DID keep the logs to do this, right? **

TOO MANY TABS!  Instead of all the report tabs being accessable from the
  main screen, they are grouped under the new "General", "Damage",
  "Benchmark", or "Pets" tabs on the bottom.  This reduces screen clutter.
Program no longer slows down drastically as it processes more and more
  data.
Now understands "My leader is Soandso." for pet tracking, in addition to
  "my leader is Soandso".
Added small amount of style information to HTML reports to make it use
  10-point Arial font, which is a bit smaller.
Fixed problem with program bombing if there is garbage in the log. I hope.
Added global merchant data file so that merchant data can be shared between
  characters.  It's a text file, so you can even share data with other
  players by appending their files onto your own.
Sped up the report column sorting, which also sped up the "Collating" phase
  quite a bit.
The -c command line option works now.
Fixed mob count on the "Mob Damage Taken" report.
Program will now generate report even if it doesn't know who you are, ie
  there are no "Soandso saved." lines in the logs.
Added "Sanity Check" option to disable timestamp sequence checking, and
  checking of extra "Soandso saved." lines.
Moved the "Messages" box to one of the report tabs to make better use of
  screen space.
Added "Deaths" report, to tell you how, when, and where you died.
Removed &nbsp; characters from HTML reports, except where needed to fill
  in empty table cells.  Made a BIG difference in the report size.
Added "Other Damage Output" and "Other Damage Taken" reports, that list
  the total damage done/taken by other players or mobs, not just yours.
You have to be using version 4.70 of the MS Common Controls DLL.  The
  program has always had this requirement, but now it checks for it.  This
  is only a problem if you're running Windows 95 or NT 4.0, and have NOT
  upgraded to IE 3.0 or later.  I don't expect this to affect anyone.
Added "Fishing by Zone" report.
Removed merchant inventory from the "Merchant Items Bought" report, and
  added it to the new "Merchant Inventory" report.
Changed exception file name to incorporate the character name, if known.
"You have been healed" messages now processed correctly.  Heals are now
  reported in the "Misc" and "Level Stats" reports.
Old faction names without spaces in them now added in with their new
  equivalents that have spaces in them.
Added option to ignore old-style spoofable loot messages.  Default is
  to ignore them.
Report Save options moved from the [Options] section of the INI file
  to the [SaveReports] section.
All zone name references to "Warslilks Woods" replaced with 
  "Warsliks Woods".
All faction name references to "LegionOfCabalis" replaced with 
  "Legion Of Cabilis".
All faction name references to "CabalisResidents" replaced with 
  "Cabilis Residents".
All faction name references to "PhingelAtropos" replaced with 
  "Phinigel Atropos".

Version 0.8
