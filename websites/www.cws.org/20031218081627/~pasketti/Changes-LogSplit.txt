Version 1.9

Now understands new "eqlog_charname_servername.txt" log file name.

Version 1.8

Added "Sanity Check" option that ignores extraneous "saved" messages.

Individual log files are now deleted immediately after splitting,
  instead of after all files have been split.  This makes it easier to
  recover from errors.

Version 1.7.1

Bug fix.  Sometimes files would be labeled as being for the year
1969 or 1970.

Version 1.7

Now handles Daylight Savings Time transitions a little better.

Version 1.6

Grabs the correct character name from the file name if the
file name is of the format eqlog_Charname_XX.txt.

Version 1.5

Doesn't produce errors when it hits a broken faction message.

Fixes broken faction messages by joining them together into a
  single line.

Version 1.4

Can now split by day, week, month, and year in addition to session.

Now gets default character name from the file name, if it's of
  the pattern eqlog_XX_Charname.txt that EQ now produces, or if 
  it's of the pattern Charname-date.txt that LogSplit itself 
  produces.

Maximum zone time is now 300 seconds (5 minutes).

If splitting by session, and the log is out of sequence, a new
  session will be started at that point.  If not splitting by
  session, the program will abort.

Version 1.3.1

Added "EQ Log Files (eqlog*.txt)" option to file selection box.

Version 1.3

Added ability to split multiple files.

Now gets default character name from the file name, if it's of
  the pattern eqlog_XX_Charname.txt that EQ now produces.

Added auto-delete input files option.

Version 1.2

Program now detects manually turning on the log, and starts a new
  file when it detects it.

  Thanks to Healani Goodheart of the Order of Concord for
  assistance and log files to fix this.

Added "Zone Time" parameter to adjust for people who take longer
  to zone.  Default is 75 seconds, which should be adequate.

Version 1.1

Deleting the original file now moves it to the Recycle Bin.

Program now saves the file name that you last split, since this
  will almost certainly wind up being EQLOG.TXT every time.

Version 1.0
