Once again, I've been summoned by King Ak'Anon.  I tried to figure out what
he could want with me this time.  The <a href="eqini.html">INI File
Editor</a> was a great success, but I didn't think that was the reason. 
Could those pesky Fier'dal still be complaining about that machanical tree
chopper?  I needed a big tree to test it with.  And it's not like that
platform was very big.  I'd be surprised if there were more than one or two
buildings on it.  I think <b>they're</b> the ones that should be paying
<b>me</b> reparations for destroying my hard work.<P>

"BZZZT-PING!  Pasketti!  Once again, I need your help.  CLANG-TOCK!  People
have log files of amazing size and complexity, and are having trouble making
sense out of them.  PTANG-CLICK-WHIRRR!  I want you to write a program that
can help people makse sense of their logs! BRRT-CLANK!"<P>

"Yes, Sire!  I'll get right on it!"<P>

"PTING-CREAK!  Also, some of these logs have information from more than one
character in them.  You will need to come up with a way to split up log
files by game session!  CLINK!"<P>

"Understood, Sire!<P>

I returned to my workshop and have crafted these programs.<P>
