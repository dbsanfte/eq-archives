				<b><font face="Arial">UPDATE 10-11-04 - CANADIAN THANKSGIVING 
				DAY:</font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Arial">A lot has happened since June 1st. Many of the 
				people who were in ATITD have moved on. We are still maintaining 
				a forum for it, but it has ultimately not played as big a part 
				in the guild as we thought. Pat and I are playing EVE Online a 
				lot. Siofra and Grim are heavily involved in other games but still 
				manage to get to Manic Mondays now and then. Reielle is working 
				full time and has a hard time getting into the game to play. Snowghost 
				has become the ladies' man of the Tunare server, and Amberfox 
				and Micronta continue to make things fun for everyone they meet. 
				Heathyr and Kareesh are still a-feuding (in fun, of course), Matawno 
				is taking a hiatus, and Framunda got married to the lovely Khmere. 
				And Sylea is back with us, large as life and twice as beautiful!!</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial">Pat is still in love with EQ and has started 
				to play more of it again...at least 2-3 times a week. He is still 
				committed to leading the Manic Monday raids (meet at 9pm Eastern 
				every Monday at the Carillon spot near the tree beside the halfling 
				bank in PoK - join channel /MMonday). And I am committed to backing 
				him and Carillon. With the new forum and the new website, we are 
				hoping people will feel more at home.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial"><b>UPDATE 6-01-04:</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial">Another love has entered our lives...Egypt in 
				the desert. Yes, you heard right...Egypt...specifically <b>A Tale 
				in the Desert</b>. Although is has not entirely replaced our first 
				love (EverQuest), this game has become a compelling part of many 
				Carilloners' lives. Therefore we have added a new part to our 
				forums, which is--by and large--totally separate from the EQ gaming 
				side of Carillon. While it is true that many members of the EQ 
				division have also joined A Tale in the Desert (or ATITD as it 
				is more commonly known), we also have Carillon in the Desert members 
				who are not a part of the EQ division (and vice versa).</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial"> </font><font face="Arial"><b>UPDATE 2-27-04:</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial">Because of the desire to help Carillon grow 
				in the direction of EverQuest, after long and careful thought 
				Pat and I have decided to discontinue Carillon's two non-EQ divisions, 
				i.e. Neverwinter Nights (NWN) and Star Wars Galaxies (SWG). These 
				two latter divisions were an experiment that didn't really work 
				the way we had intended. And it was becoming too time-consuming 
				to deal with them the way they deserved.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial">We want to thank everyone who tried them out...and 
				especially the moderators of these divisions -- Tooncis (Barbarella) 
				for the SWG division -- and Jasarina and Drakhuul for the NWN 
				division. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial">If you have any questions, please feel free 
				to email us -- <a href="mailto:raydiance_alive@yahoo.com">Raydiance 
				Alive</a> or <a href="mailto:patrynn_ironfist@yahoo.com">Patrynn 
				Ironfist</a>.</font></p>
			<hr>
			<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial"><b>Some things to note for the 
				EQ portion of Carillon</b> <font size="2">(server is Tunare)</font>: 
				<font size="2">(updated 10-19-04)</font></font></p>
			<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">1. We are small -- and are not 
				looking to expand rapidly. It is more important to us to maintain 
				the friendly, helpful and fun atmosphere that has been established 
				in Carillon. However, our vision is to establish three solid and 
				balanced groups of members so that we can take on most events 
				and areas within the guild.</font></p>
			<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">2. For larger or higher-end 
				raiding purposes, we will seek out mutually cooperative grouping 
				with our friendship guilds or allies.</font></p>
			<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">3. You may belong to other guilds. 
				Alts are welcome. We understand that your other-guilded main will 
				owe loyalty to his/her originating guild. However, in order to 
				avoid misunderstanding, we want to point out that your alt's loyalty 
				is with Carillon. </font></p>
			<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">4. You are not required to do 
				anything in Carillon, except follow the Golden Rule with caring 
				and compassion, and also the following:</font></p>
			<blockquote>
				<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">(a) We ask you to keep yourself 
					informed of events within Carillon. The main avenue for information 
					is the <a href="http://www.twobells.com/forum/" target="_blank">Carillon 
					message boards</a>. We also try to put up a Guild Message 
					of the Day in-game. However that is only readable by guilded 
					members. Please do not rely on others to keep you informed. 
					That is your responsibility.</font></p>
				<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">(b) The other thing we ask 
					you is to maintain a friendly, positive environment in the 
					guild chat channel. If you have concerns or problems with 
					ANYTHING about the guild, PLEASE come to Pat and/or Ray and 
					discuss it. We will try our very best to address your concerns. 
					If it is urgent and neither Pat nor Ray is available, contact 
					one of Carillon's officers in-game...currently Reielle, Sylea, 
					Snowghost, and Heathyr, or any of their alts.</font></p>
			</blockquote>
			<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">5. We encourage people to do 
				their thing in Carillon. Whatever you enjoy doing, be it leadership, 
				trade skills, socializing, serious play -- you will receive encouragement 
				and backing.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">6. The prime motivation in Carillon 
				is a caring atmosphere geared to having fun and sharing our experiences, 
				whether it is in actual grouping, via our reserved chat channel, 
				or simply on the <a href="http://www.twobells.com/forum/" target="_blank">Carillon 
				message boards</a>.</font></p>
