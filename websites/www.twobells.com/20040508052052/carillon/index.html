      couple. Membership is by invitation only. If you would like to join Carillon, 
      come and meet Ray and Pat -- get to know them. Get to know some of our other 
      lively members. Visit our forum and read the Welcome speech :) Put your

      		<p><font face="Arial">Because of the desire to help Carillon grow 
				in the direction of EQ, after long and careful thought Pat and 
				I have decided to discontinue the two non-EQ divisions, i.e. Neverwinter 
				Nights (NWN) and Star Wars Galaxies (SWG). These two latter divisions 
				were an experiment that didn't really work the way we had intended. 
				And it was becoming too time-consuming to deal with them the way 
				they deserved.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial">We want to thank everyone who tried them out...and 
				especially the moderators of these divisions -- Tooncis (Barbarella) 
				for the SWG division -- and Jasarina and Drakhuul for the NWN 
				division. </font></p>
      		<p><font face="Arial">If you have any questions, please feel free 
				to email us -- <a href="mailto:raydiance_alive@yahoo.com">Raydiance 
				Alive</a> or <a href="mailto:patrynn_ironfist@yahoo.com">Patrynn 
				Ironfist</a>.</font></p>

      <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial"><b>Some things to note for the EQ 
        portion of Carillon</b> <font size="2">(server is Tunare)</font>:</font></p>
      		<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">1. We are small -- and are not 
				looking to expand rapidly. It is more important to us to maintain 
				the friendly, helpful and fun atmosphere that has been established 
				in Carillon. However, our vision is to establish three solid and 
				balanced groups of members so that we can take on most events 
				and areas within the guild.</font></p>
      		<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">2. For larger or higher-end 
				raiding purposes, we will seek out mutually cooperative grouping 
				with our friendship guilds or allies.<font size="3"> Pat and I 
				and some other Carillon members are currently associated with 
				Project Betty (sponsored by the guild Force of Valor). If you 
				are interested in this very worthy project, go <a href="http://pub89.ezboard.com/fforceofvalorforumfrm52">here</a> 
				for more information.</font></font></p>
      		<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">3. You may belong to other guilds. 
				Alts are welcome. We understand that your other-guilded main will 
				owe loyalty to his/her originating guild. However, in order to 
				avoid misunderstanding, we want to point out that your alt's loyalty 
				is with Carillon. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">4. You are not required to do anything 
        in Carillon except follow the Golden Rule with caring and compassion (and 
        register your character in Guild Magic - failing to do so is a naggable 
        offense :)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">5. We encourage people to do their 
        thing in Carillon. Whatever you enjoy doing, be it leadership, trade skills, 
        socializing, serious play -- you will receive encouragement and backing.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">6. The prime motivation in Carillon 
        is a caring atmosphere geared to having fun and sharing our experiences, 
        whether it is in actual grouping, via our reserved chat channel, or simply 
        on the Carillon message boards.</font></p>
