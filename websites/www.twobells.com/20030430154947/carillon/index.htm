      The rules are simple. Respect and caring. The Golden Rule. We are a family. 
      The head of the family is Raydiance. She is supported by her RL husband, 
      Patrynn Ironfist, a knowledgeable and caring person. Membership is by invitation 
      only. If you would like to join Carillon, come and meet Ray and Pat -- get 
      to know them. Get to know some of our other lively members. Visit our forum 
      and read the Welcome speech :) Put your feet up at the fire and chat.<font size="2">

      <p><b><font face="Arial">UPDATE 4-17-03:</font></b></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Because of the changing interests of Carillon members, 
        we have decided to open the guild up to other game players as well. These 
        games include, for the time being, Neverwinter Nights (NWN) and Star Wars 
        Galaxies (SWG). We are also considering Shadowbane (SB) and EverQuest 
        II (EQ2).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">We are currently taking a look at the requirements 
        and benefits of members in the NWN section. Since NWN is already a go 
        and since many of our Carillon EQ players are already NWN players as well, 
        it will be used as the testing grounds for this experiment. Please bear 
        with us, as we change to accommodate the needs and desires of our membership 
        in these various areas.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">The moderator of the NWN section of Carillon is Jasarina 
        (Anarawyn Clan).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">The moderator of the SWG section of Carillon is Tooncis 
        (resmiranda). Since SWG is still in beta and not expected to be released 
        to the public until some time in June or July, this portion of Carillon 
        will be relatively quiet. However, we have several enthusiastic beta testers 
        already playing the game...they are bound by a Non-disclosure Agreement, 
        but will let us have tidbits from time to time that whet our appetite 
        for this enchanting game. <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">You can access the message board portions of both 
        these sections through the <a href="http://pub113.ezboard.com/bcarillon81753" target="new">Carillon 
        EzBoard forums</a>.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">You can email Carillon via its leaders -- <a href="mailto:raydiance_alive@yahoo.com">Raydiance 
        Alive</a> or <a href="mailto:patrynn_ironfist@yahoo.com">Patrynn Ironfist</a>.</font></p>
      <hr>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">Some things to note for the EQ portion 
        of Carillon:</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">1. We are small -- we intend to stay 
        small -- we are not an uber/raid guild.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">2. For raiding purposes, we will seek 
        out an alliance with other guilds. Only guilds that follow our Golden 
        Rule will be considered. <font size="2">(We are currently allied with 
        Madcap Elite and Legends of Madcap.)</font></font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">3. You may belong to other guilds. 
        Alts are welcome.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">4. You are not required to do anything 
        in Carillon except follow the Golden Rule with caring and compassion.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">5. We encourage people to do their 
        thing in Carillon. Whatever you enjoy doing, be it leadership, trade skills, 
        socializing, serious play -- you will receive encouragement and backing.</font></p>
