      <p><font face="Arial"><br>
        <b><font size="5">General Guild Structure</font></b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Carillon is a family guild based on the principles 
        of caring and sharing. The Golden Rule is our motto and our basic creed, 
        both within the guild and with other players in the game. In an attempt 
        to sidestep politics and get on with the playing of the game, we have 
        structured Carillon as a family unit. The head of the family is Raydiance 
        Alive...with Patrynn Ironfist as the grampa or patriarch...i.e. the last 
        court of appeal.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Everyone else in the guild is an honored member of 
        the family. Everyone has equal say...everyone has equal input. If a dispute 
        arises, we all discuss it...like a family. If there is a deadlock, we 
        either put it aside...or it goes to Raydiance...and finally to Patrynn. 
        If Patrynn is forced to make a decision, his decision will be final and 
        will be honored.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="4"><b><font size="5">Purpose of the Guild</font></b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">The main purpose of Carillon is to provide a stress-free 
        environment to perpetuate the enjoyment of EverQuest and other games. 
        Each member, as far as is possible, agrees to back other members in the 
        pursuit of being able to relax and enjoy the game.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Sony has created a rich world (EverQuest) to adventure 
        in. Far too often some people only look at what they can get and not what 
        the world truly has to offer. Carillon will assist people in the adventuring 
        part so that our members will have a better chance of enjoying the splendor 
        and diversity of Norrath.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Carillon encourages members to come up with goals 
        for themselves in the game, so that they know what they want out of it. 
        Carillon will help its members achieve their goals insofar as is possible. 
        Anyone who would like to see events or special nights started is encouraged 
        to step up and take the lead to organize them. Carillon will back people 
        in their leadership projects, in their goals, and help them carry them 
        out.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">With respect to raiding, we never do plan to have 
        enough to carry on the uber high end raids ourselves. We will ally ourselves 
        with worthy guilds for this, bringing our talents, our skills, our positive 
        attitudes and our helpful ways. Otherwise, we will probably have 2 to 
        3 groups within the guild of skilled players, enough to be able to enjoy 
        the high end game within our own ranks. Note that we are NOT and never 
        will be a raiding guild. However, raids add to the enjoyment of game play 
        and are necessary for specific quests, including attaining epic items.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="4"><b><font size="5">Definitions</font></b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><i><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Note: For the time 
        being, Carillon is concerned solely with the game of EverQuest. Therefore 
        the following definitions, plus any guidelines and procedures that may 
        follow, are applicable to people in the guild who are playing EverQuest. 
        As other interests are added, these items will be revised to reflect different 
        parameters.</font></i></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><b><i>Applicant:</i></b> An EQ player who wishes to 
        become a candidate to Carillon. It is the applicant&#146;s responsibility 
        to read the Charter, Guidelines and Procedures of Carillon thoroughly. 
        S/he also needs to make him/herself available to play with Pat and Ray 
        as required (see Procedure for Admission of Applicants). It would be helpful 
        if both the recommending member and the applicant post on the General 
        Discussion Board of the Carillon forum, telling a little bit about the 
        applicant and why s/he wants to join Carillon.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><b><i>Banker or Family Banker:</i></b> Currently, 
        Tooncis and Stinkle are the family bankers. Their mule (Sellout) carries 
        the goods contributed by Carillon members, and Toon and Stinkle attempt 
        to sell them for the benefit of said members. There are other financial 
        plans to be worked out and put down on &#147;paper&#148; which Tooncis 
        and Stinkle will be overseeing.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><b><i>Candidate:</i></b> An applicant who has been 
        invited into Carillon on a 30-day probationary basis.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><b><i>Carillon Alt:</i></b> Any character guilded 
        in Carillon that is NOT a Carillon Main.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><b><i>Carillon Chat Channel:</i></b> A chat channel 
        set up as the official channel for Carillon applicants, candidates and 
        members. It is particularly useful for the Carillon people whose mains 
        are in other guilds. They can play their mains and still stay in communication 
        with their Carillon guildees. The name and password of the Carillon Chat 
        Channel shall NOT be given out to anyone other than those specifically 
        designated in this paragraph. <font size="2">(The Carillon Chat Channel 
        is not to be confused with the Carillon Guild Channel which is automatically 
        part of a guilded member's communication.)</font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><b><i>Carillon Main:</i></b> Since many of Carillon&#146;s 
        members have their high level main character in other guilds, the Carillon 
        Main is the highest level character (or the character designated by the 
        player as their main) that is guilded in Carillon. This is not to be confused 
        with the player&#146;s high level main guilded in another guild <font size="2">(for 
        example &#150; Lindain, a level 62 druid, is guilded in Infinite Storm. 
        The highest level of all his alts in Carillon is Tuleran, a level 51 rogue. 
        Therefore, Tuleran is Lindy&#146;s Carillon main.).</font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><b><i>Guild Leader:</i></b> Currently Raydiance. The 
        guild leader is concerned with the day-to-day running of the guild. She 
        updates the website, communicates via email and the forum as necessary, 
        works with the Patriarch to draft policies and procedures for further 
        input, comments and approval by family members. She also arbitrates disputes 
        between family members. The guild leader, together with the Patriarch, 
        investigates and negotiates possible alliances with other guilds for final 
        approval by family members.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><b><i>Guild Magic:</i></b> A free outside tracking 
        site that provides automatic guild rosters, complete with stats. Guild 
        Magic is linked to the Carillon website and the Carillon forum.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><b><i>Inviter:</i></b> At the present time, Patrynn 
        and all his alts, plus Raydiance, are inviters for the guild. This means 
        they have the ability to invite candidates into the guild or alts of family 
        members.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><b><i>Member, Full Member or Family Member <font size="2">(these 
        terms are interchangeable)</font>:</i></b> An EQ player who is either 
        an originating member or who has successfully received all yes votes after 
        his/her probationary period as a candidate and has been admitted to Carillon. 
        These members all have equal status within Carillon and have equal say 
        in the policies and procedures put in place in order to give structure 
        and clarity to the guild. For any voting procedure, a member, full member 
        or family member includes the player's Carillon main and Carillon alts, 
        that is, the player is entitled to one vote. Otherwise, each Carillon 
        main and each Carillon alt is accorded the same privileges, respects, 
        obligations and rights that attach to a member, full member or family 
        member.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><b><i>Newbie Knights:</i></b> This is a fun, once-a-week 
        adventure for Carillon members, candidates and applicants. It is a good 
        way to get to know each other at lower levels. Currently, Newbie Knights 
        night is Wednesday, starting at 9:30 p.m. EST.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><b><i>Originating Member:</i></b> One of 13 family 
        members who helped with the creation online of Carillon and were instrumental 
        in getting her up on her feet and ready to go. These are: Raydiance, Patrynn, 
        Cajole, Dalanara (Reielle), Fineus, Framunda, Jasarina, Krisalis (Qath), 
        Rakoril (Treebranch), Stinkle, Tooncis, Tudora, Tuleran (Lindain).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><b><i>Pat and/or Ray <font size="2">(or any variations 
        thereof)</font>:</i></b> See definitions for <i>Patriarch</i> and <i>Guild 
        Leader</i>.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><b><i>Patriarch:</i></b> Currently Patrynn. If the 
        guild leader cannot resolve a dispute, then the Patriarch will have the 
        final and absolute decision. This decision will be backed 100% by the 
        guild leader and the family members. The Patriarch also investigates and 
        negotiates possible alliances with other guilds for final approval by 
        family members.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><b><i>Recommending Member:</i></b> A full member who 
        knows someone s/he thinks would be a compatible member in Carillon and 
        introduces that person as an applicant to Carillon. It is the recommending 
        member&#146;s responsibility to direct the applicant to the Carillon website 
        and forum and to explain the application procedure to the applicant.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><b><font size="5">Application Process and Voting Procedures</font></b><br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><b><font size="4"><i><font size="3" color="#001F9B">Procedure 
        for Admission of Applicants as Candidates:</font></i></font></b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><b>**1. No applicant shall be admitted as a candidate 
        unless s/he is recommended by at least one family member and has played 
        in-game at least once with Pat and/or Ray.**</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">2. Applicants may be given the name and password to 
        the Carillon chat channel only in the discretion of the recommending member. 
        No other casual person may be given the name and password to the Carillon 
        chat channel.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">3. A person desiring to be an applicant is required 
        to fill out an <a href="http://pub113.ezboard.com/fcarillon81753frm22.showMessage?topicID=2.topic" target="new">Application 
        Form</a> to be found in <a href="http://pub113.ezboard.com/fcarillon81753frm22" target="new">Applicant's 
        Corner</a> on the <a href="http://pub113.ezboard.com/bcarillon81753" target="new">Carillon 
        message board</a>.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">4. If Pat and/or Ray feel more play time with the 
        applicant is necessary, they will ask the recommending member to arrange 
        this time with the applicant.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">5. Whether or not an applicant is invited as a candidate 
        to Carillon will be in the sole discretion of Pat and Ray.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><b><i><font size="3" color="#003399">Rights and Obligations 
        of Candidates:</font></i></b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">1. Once an applicant becomes a candidate, they are 
        accorded all the rights and privileges of a family member EXCEPT for the 
        following:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Arial">- access to Full Members Forum<br>
          - guilding of Carillon alts until after the vote<br>
          - voting privileges on guild matters<br>
          - recommending other applicants unless approved by a family member as 
          well</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial">2. It is the candidate&#146;s obligation to get to 
        know the rest of the family. Alternatively, it is the family member&#146;s 
        responsibility to get to know the candidate. Each party needs to feel 
        comfortable with the other&#133;so that true family feeling can be nurtured.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">3. The candidate must register his/her character applying 
        to Carillon on <a href="http://eq.guildmagic.com/" target="new">Guild 
        Magic</a>. <font size="2">(Remember to list Carillon as one of your guilds 
        and to check Carillon as your guilding character's guild.)</font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">4. The candidate will wear the guild tag, share the 
        guild channel and the Carillon chat channel. S/he will have access to 
        all passworded member forums, except the Full Members Forum. The candidate 
        may also be asked for input on certain guild matters.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">5. At the end of the 30-day probationary period, Ray 
        will put up a voting poll in the Full Members Forum.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><b><i><font size="3" color="#003399">Voting Procedures:</font></i></b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">1. The time span of the poll will be one week, which 
        will encompass the 30th day of the probationary period. The poll will 
        be locked at midnight EST on the last day of polling. Results will be 
        announced the following morning.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">2. Each family member is entitled to one vote for 
        the candidate&#133;either yes or no.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">3. Except in extenuating circumstances, a family member 
        must vote in person, using his/her regular EzBoard account. Only one vote 
        per family member will be accepted.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">4. If a family member votes <i>yes</i>, s/he may or 
        may not add in the thread below WHY the <i>yes </i>vote, in his/her sole 
        discretion.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">5. <i>No</i> votes:</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">- If a family member votes <i>no</i>, s/he must add 
        in the thread below his/her reason(s) for the <i>no</i> vote. If the member 
        fails to do so, the <i>no </i>vote will be discarded.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">- If the <i>no</i>-voting member has indicated his/her 
        reason, a discussion in the thread will take place by all full members 
        who wish to take part.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">- If the concern can be resolved, the <i>no</i> vote 
        will be discarded.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">- If the concern cannot be resolved, the candidate 
        will be denied full admission to Carillon. S/he may be given a further 
        30-day probationary period OR s/he may be deguilded, depending on the 
        outcome of the discussion. It will be up to the recommending member to 
        explain the circumstances to the candidate. Further conversation may be 
        entered into with Ray and/or Pat.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">6. Abstaining votes will not be an option. A family 
        member may decide NOT to vote, and that is his/her right. However, it 
        is good to be aware that once a candidate has acquired 100% <i>yes</i> 
        votes by the time the polls close, that candidate will be admitted to 
        Carillon with all the rights and privileges of a family member.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">7. A candidate MUST receive 100% <i>YES</i> votes 
        and 0% <i>NO</i> votes in order to be admitted to Carillon as a family 
        member.<font size="2"> (At this time there is no minimum number of votes 
        required. That may change.)</font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">8. Once a candidate has passed the requirements and 
        voted in as set out in item 7 above, s/he will be given the password to 
        the Full Members Forum. The new family member may then have as many Carillon 
        alts admitted to Carillon as s/he wishes (once the alts are guilded, the 
        new family member is strongly urged to register these alts on Guild Magic 
        as well). From then on the new family member will take his/her place as 
        a full member of Carillon, with all the rights and obligations that this 
        entails.</font></p>

        being in game and NOT the message board <font size="2">(one restriction 
        here is that most changes will be posted on the boards. If you want to 
        keep informed, it would be a good idea to at least read the boards --
