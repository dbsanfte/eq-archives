				CARILLON</font></b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><br>
        <b><font size="5">General Guild Structure</font></b></font></p>
      		<p><font face="Arial">Carillon is a family guild based on the principles 
				of caring and sharing. The Golden Rule is our basic creed, both 
				within the guild and with other players in the game. In an attempt 
				to sidestep politics and get on with the playing of our games 
				of choice, we have structured Carillon as a family unit. The head 
				of the family is Raydiance Alive...with Patrynn Ironfist as the 
				grampa or patriarch...i.e. the last court of appeal.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial">We have now included officers in the structure. 
				This is mainly to provide more services to the family members. 
				With EVERYTHING depending on Pat and Ray, some things were falling 
				through the cracks.</font></p>
      		<p><font face="Arial">Everyone else in the guild is an honored member 
				of the family. Everyone has equal say...everyone has equal input. 
				If a dispute arises, we all discuss it...like a family. If there 
				is a deadlock, we either put it aside...or it goes to discussion 
				of the officers and Pat and Ray. If this unit cannot arrive at 
				a decision, it goes to Raydiance...and finally to Patrynn. If 
				Patrynn is forced to make a decision, his decision will be final 
				and will be honored.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="4"><b><font size="5">Purpose of the Guild</font></b></font></p>
      		<p><font face="Arial"><b><font color="#00FFFF">The main purpose of 
				Carillon is to provide a stress-free environment to perpetuate 
				the enjoyment of EverQuest. Each member, as far as is possible, 
				agrees to back other members in the pursuit of being able to relax 
				and enjoy the game.</font></b></font></p>
      		<p><font face="Arial">We have inherited a rich world (EverQuest) to 
				adventure in. Far too often some people only look at what they 
				can get and not what the world truly has to offer. Carillon will 
				assist people in the adventuring part so that our members will 
				have a better chance of enjoying the splendor and diversity of 
				Norrath.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Carillon encourages members to come up with goals 
        for themselves in the game, so that they know what they want out of it. 
        Carillon will help its members achieve their goals insofar as is possible. 
        Anyone who would like to see events or special nights started is encouraged 
        to step up and take the lead to organize them. Carillon will back people 
        in their leadership projects, in their goals, and help them carry them 
        out.</font></p>
      		<p><font face="Arial">With respect to raiding, we never do plan to 
				have enough to carry on the uber high end raids ourselves. We 
				are looking to enhance Carillon by aiming towards having three 
				capable and well balanced groups of skilled players within the 
				guild, to be able to enjoy the high end game within our own ranks. 
				Note that we are NOT and never will be a raiding guild. However, 
				raids add to the enjoyment of game play and are necessary for 
				specific quests, including attaining epic items. For the raids 
				that need more manpower, we look to other friendly guilds for 
				support.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="4"><b><font size="5">Definitions</font></b></font></p>
      		<p><font face="Arial"><b><i>Applicant:</i></b> A player who wishes 
				to become a candidate to Carillon. It is the applicant&#146;s 
				responsibility to read the Charter, Guidelines and Procedures 
				of Carillon thoroughly. S/he also needs to make him/herself available 
				to play with Pat and Ray as required (see Procedure for Admission 
				of Applicants). The applicant must complete an application on 
				the <a href="http://www.twobells.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=6" target="_blank">Applicant's 
				Corner</a>.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial"><b><i>Application:</i></b> The written request 
				from an applicant to join Carillon. The form for this is found 
				in <a href="http://www.twobells.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=6" target="_blank">a 
				stickied post</a> in the <a href="http://www.twobells.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=6" target="_blank">Applicant's 
				Corner</a>. The applicant copies this form, creates a new thread 
				in Applicant's Corner, fills out the form with his/her details, 
				and posts it for the information of the members.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><b><i>Candidate:</i></b> An applicant who has been 
        invited into Carillon on a 30-day probationary basis.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><b><i>Carillon Alt:</i></b> Any character guilded 
        in Carillon that is NOT a Carillon Main.</font></p>
      		<p><font face="Arial"><b><i>Carillon Chat Channel:</i></b> A chat 
				channel set up as the official channel for Carillon candidates 
				and members. It is particularly useful for the Carillon people 
				whose mains are in other guilds. They can play their mains or 
				alts and still stay in communication with their Carillon guildees. 
				<b><font color="#00FFFF">The name and password of the Carillon 
				Chat Channel shall NOT be given out to anyone other than candidates 
				and members.</font></b> <font size="2">(The Carillon Chat Channel 
				is not to be confused with the Carillon Guild Channel which is 
				automatically part of a guilded member's communication.)</font></font></p>
      		<p><font face="Arial"><b><i>Carillon Main:</i></b> Since some Carillon 
				members have their high level main character in other guilds, 
				the Carillon Main is the highest level character (or the character 
				designated by the player as their Carillon main) that is guilded 
				in Carillon. This is not to be confused with the player&#146;s 
				high level main guilded in another guild <font size="2">(for example 
				&#150; Forte, a level 67 mage, is guilded in another guild. His 
				46 warrior, Trommel, is guilded in Carillon. Therefore, Trommel 
				is Forte &#146;s Carillon main.).</font></font></p>
      		<p><font face="Arial"><b><i><font color="#FFFFFF">Guild Leaders:</font></i></b><font color="#FFFFFF"> 
				Currently Raydiance and Patrynn are the co-leaders of Carillon. 
				They are concerned with the day-to-day running of the guild. They 
				update the website, communicate via email and the forum as necessary, 
				work with the officers to draft policies and procedures for further 
				input, comments and approval by family members. They, along with 
				the officers, arbitrate disputes between family members. They 
				investigate and negotiate possible alliances with other guilds 
				for final approval by family members.</font></font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial"><b><i>Member, Full Member or Family Member <font size="2">(these 
				terms are interchangeable)</font>:</i></b> A player who is either 
				an originating member or who has successfully received all yes 
				votes after his/her probationary period as a candidate and has 
				been admitted to Carillon. These members all have equal status 
				within Carillon and have equal say in the policies and procedures 
				put in place in order to give structure and clarity to the guild. 
				For any voting procedure, a member, full member or family member 
				includes the player's Carillon main and Carillon alts, that is, 
				the player is entitled to one vote. Otherwise, each Carillon main 
				and each Carillon alt is accorded the same privileges, respects, 
				obligations and rights that attach to a member, full member or 
				family member.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial"><b><i>Officer:</i></b> A family member selected 
				by Pat and Ray to assist in the day to day running of the guild. 
				Officers may invite applicants to be candidates and alts of guilded 
				members to also be family members. Officers need to know this 
				Charter well and be able to provide answers to applicants, candidates 
				and family members on the guild. Officers help Pat and Ray with 
				the day to day running of the guild, including changing of the 
				Guild Motto of the Day in game as necessary, arbitrating disputes 
				between members, and being ambassadors of Carillon to other guilds 
				and players.</font></p>
      		<p><font face="Arial"><b><i><font color="#FFFFFF">Originating Member:</font></i></b><font color="#FFFFFF"> 
				One of 14 family members who helped with the creation online of 
				Carillon and were instrumental in getting the guild up on her 
				feet and ready to go. These are: <font color="#00FFFF">Raydiance,

			<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF"><b><i>Patriarch:</i></b> Currently 
				Patrynn. If the guild leaders and officers cannot together resolve 
				a dispute, then the Patriarch will have the final and absolute 
				decision. This decision will be backed 100% by the guild leader 
				and the family members. The Patriarch also heads up the investigation 
				and negotiation of possible alliances with other guilds for final 
				approval by family members.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><b><i>Recommending Member:</i></b> A full member who 
        knows someone s/he thinks would be a compatible member in the EQ division 
        of Carillon and introduces that person as an applicant to Carillon. It 
        is the recommending member&#146;s responsibility to direct the applicant 
        to the Carillon website and forum and to explain the application procedure 
        to the applicant.</font></p>

      		<p><font face="Arial">2. Serious applicants may be given the name 
				and password to the Carillon chat channel only in the discretion 
				of the recommending member and only after the applicant has put 
				up their application to become a candidate in the Applicant's 
				Corner. <b><font color="#00FFFF">No other casual person may be 
				given the name and password to the Carillon chat channel</font></b><font color="#00FFFF">.</font></font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial">3. If Pat and/or Ray feel more play time with 
				the applicant is necessary, they will ask the recommending member 
				to arrange this time with the applicant.</font></p>
      		<p><font face="Arial">4. Whether or not an applicant is invited as 
				a candidate to Carillon will be in the sole discretion of Pat 
				and Ray.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><b><i><font size="3" color="#003399">Rights and Obligations 
        of Candidates:</font></i></b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">1. Once an applicant becomes a candidate, they are 
        accorded all the rights and privileges of a family member EXCEPT for the 
        following:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Arial">- access to Full Members Forum<br>
          - guilding of Carillon alts until after the vote<br>
          - voting privileges on guild matters<br>
          - recommending other applicants unless approved by a family member as 
          well</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      		<p><font face="Arial">2. It is the candidate&#146;s obligation to 
				get to know the rest of the family. Alternatively, it is the family 
				members' responsibility to get to know the candidate. Each party 
				needs to feel comfortable with the other&#133;so that true family 
				feeling can be nurtured. It is the recommending member's responsibility 
				to ensure that the candidate gets opportunities to meet the other 
				members and to introduce him/her to the other members of the guild.</font></p>
      		<p><font face="Arial">3. The candidate will wear the guild tag, share 
				the guild channel and the Carillon chat channel. S/he will have 
				access to all passworded member forums, except the Full Members 
				Forum. The candidate may also be asked for input on certain guild 
				matters.</font></p>
      		<p><font face="Arial">4. At the end of the 30-day probationary period, 
				Ray will put up a voting poll in the Full Members Forum.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><b><i><font size="3" color="#003399">Voting Procedures:</font></i></b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">1. The time span of the poll will be one week, which 
        will encompass the 30th day of the probationary period. The poll will 
        be locked at midnight EST on the last day of polling. Results will be 
        announced the following morning.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">2. Each family member is entitled to one vote for 
        the candidate&#133;either yes or no.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">3. Except in extenuating circumstances, a family member 
        must vote in person, using his/her regular EzBoard account. Only one vote 
        per family member will be accepted.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">4. If a family member votes <i>yes</i>, s/he may or 
        may not add in the thread below WHY the <i>yes </i>vote, in his/her sole 
        discretion.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">5. <i>No</i> votes:</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">- If a family member votes <i>no</i>, s/he must add 
        in the thread below his/her reason(s) for the <i>no</i> vote. If the member 
        fails to do so, the <i>no </i>vote will be discarded.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">- If the <i>no</i>-voting member has indicated his/her 
        reason, a discussion in the thread will take place by all full members 
        who wish to take part.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">- If the concern can be resolved, the <i>no</i> vote 
        will be discarded.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">- If the concern cannot be resolved, the candidate 
        will be denied full admission to Carillon. S/he may be given a further 
        30-day probationary period OR s/he may be deguilded, depending on the 
        outcome of the discussion. It will be up to the recommending member to 
        explain the circumstances to the candidate. Further conversation may be 
        entered into with Ray and/or Pat.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">6. Abstaining votes will not be an option. A family 
        member may decide NOT to vote, and that is his/her right. However, it 
        is good to be aware that once a candidate has acquired 100% <i>yes</i> 
        votes by the time the polls close, that candidate will be admitted to 
        Carillon with all the rights and privileges of a family member.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">7. A candidate MUST receive 100% <i>YES</i> votes 
        and 0% <i>NO</i> votes in order to be admitted to Carillon as a family 
        member.<font size="2"> (At this time there is no minimum number of votes 
        required. That may change.)</font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">8. Once a candidate has passed the requirements and 
        voted in as set out in item 7 above, s/he will be given the password to 
        the Full Members Forum. The new family member may then have as many Carillon 
        alts admitted to Carillon as s/he wishes (once the alts are guilded, the 
        new family member is strongly urged to register these alts on Guild Magic 
        as well). From then on the new family member will take his/her place as 
        a full member of Carillon, with all the rights and obligations that this 
        entails.</font></p>
      		<p><font face="Arial"><b><font size="5">Responsibility of Guild Members

				here is that most changes will be posted on the boards. If you 
				want to keep informed, it would be a good idea to at least read 
				the boards -- if something is taken to a vote of the membership,

				We would ask, if you have specific problems with the guild, to 
				bring them to Pat and Ray. Discussing them at length in the Carillon 
				chat channel when Pat and Ray are not around can be counterproductive
