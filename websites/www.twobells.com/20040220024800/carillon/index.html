      The rules are simple. Respect and caring. The Golden Rule. We are a family. 
      Heading up the family are Raydiance Alive and Patrynn Ironfist, a RL married 
      couple. Membership is by invitation only. If you would like to join Carillon, 
      come and meet Ray and Pat -- get to know them. Get to know some of our other 
      lively members. Visit our forum and read the Welcome speech :) Put your

      <p><font face="Arial"><b>UPDATE 12-04-03:</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Because of the changing interests of Carillon members, 
        we have opened the guild up to other game players as well. These games 
        include Neverwinter Nights (NWN) and Star Wars Galaxies (SWG). We are 
        also considering EverQuest II (EQ2).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">We are currently taking a look at the requirements 
        and benefits of members in the NWN section. Since NWN is already a go 
        and since many of our Carillon EQ players are already NWN players as well, 
        it has been used as the testing grounds for this experiment. It would 
        appear that the enthusiasm for NWN grows and wanes. It seems to be more 
        of an outlet for disgruntled EQ players than anything else at the moment. 
        However, it is an outstanding game and we reserve its space on the board 
        for anyone who is enjoying the game at the moment. Our biggest difficulty 
        to date with getting NWN up and going as a guild division of Carillon 
        is the lack of dedicated servers...for some reason Pat and I can't access 
        each other's server, and there were no people at the time who had the 
        capability. This may change, especially over Christmas this year, when 
        Pat has a whole week's holiday *eg*.</font></p>
      		<p><font face="Arial">The moderators of the NWN section of Carillon 
				is Drakhuul.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">The moderator of the SWG section of Carillon is Tooncis 
        (resmiranda). Since the release date of June 26/03, there has been a huge 
        flux in the status and enthusiasm of the SWG players. Many are not playing 
        right now...some are struggling to maintain their enthusiasm. Carillon 
        is no longer the only venue for these players, since they receive more 
        benefits through player guilds within SWG itself. Ray and Pat do not play 
        SWG anymore (largely for financial reasons). However, Carillon is still 
        open to our SWG players, current and former, as a meeting spot, a place 
        to exchange ideas, and also a place for our dear friends in SWG to touch 
        base now and then with EQ.</font></p>

      <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial"><b>Some things to note for the EQ 
        portion of Carillon</b> <font size="2">(server is Tunare)</font>:</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">1. We are small -- and are not looking 
        to expand rapidly. It is more important to us to maintain the friendly, 
        helpful and fun atmosphere that has been established in Carillon.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">2. For raiding purposes, we will seek 
        out mutually cooperative grouping with our friendship guilds or allies. 
        <font size="2">(We are currently allied with Madcap Elite and Legends 
        of Madcap. Our current friendship guilds are A dileab de Paegen, Companions 
        of Norrath, and Watchkeepers.)</font></font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">3. You may belong to other guilds. 
        Alts are welcome.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">4. You are not required to do anything 
        in Carillon except follow the Golden Rule with caring and compassion (and 
        register your character in Guild Magic - failing to do so is a naggable 
        offense :)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">5. We encourage people to do their 
        thing in Carillon. Whatever you enjoy doing, be it leadership, trade skills, 
        socializing, serious play -- you will receive encouragement and backing.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">6. The prime motivation in Carillon 
        is a caring atmosphere geared to having fun and sharing our experiences, 
        whether it is in actual grouping, via our reserved chat channel, or simply 
        on the Carillon message boards.</font></p>
