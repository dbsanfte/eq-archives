      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      <p>The Frontier Mountains are the highest and roughest set of mountians 
        located on the continent. These harsh mountains cut across the western 
        half of the continent, and are inhabited by a variety of powerful, large 
        creatures, for whom the peaks are mere hills. Many of these creatures 
        operate vast mining operations in the mountains for the minerals that 
        lie beneath them.
      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>angers </h3>
      <p>The mountains are dangerous since every creature here is looking out 
        for itself and is highly aggressive. Invisibility alone will not completely 
        protect you, as the mountain giants are able to see you even with that 
        magical protection. Every creature in this area will attack you on sight, 
        and they will all join in the chase if you happen to be the prey.
      <p>There is one specific danger to hunting in the mountains. The mountains. 
        This area is very rough, which can cause several problems. First is that 
        it is very difficult to travel quickly through this area without the use 
        of Levitate, for many of the drops off of some of these peaks are fatal 
        to all due to their great height. The other problem is that they cut down 
        significantly on visibility while hunting the area. It is often difficult 
        to see when an aggressive monster approaches you, or when you approach 
        it, until too late. Then, unless you have Levitate, it may be just as 
        painful to flee the creature as it might be to fight it...
      <h3><font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>
      <p>These mountains have several area within them that provide some open 
        hunting grounds for groups to pull from, and also provide some visibility 
        for safety. Some of the more popular ones are near the zones to Lake of 
        Ill Omen and to the Burning Woods.
      <p>There is also an abundance of rare creatures and, presumably, rare items 
        that these creatures drop. Without tracking this may not be that interesting 
        to you around here, but with tracking a person could take up hunting rares 
        as a full time hobby in the mountains.
      <p>Overall, this zone provides good hunting opportunities for any group 
        able to handle the opposition.
      <h3><font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
        <font size=+2>F</font>rontier <font size=+2>M</font>ountains</h3>
      <p>Lake of Ill Omen can be reached at approximately -675, -4000. In the 
        Lake, this corresponds to approximately -600, 3200. 
      <p>The Burning Wood is reached through a tunnel located at -2580, 3760. 
        Following this tunnel into the mountains leaves you at -2800, -4625 in 
        Burning Wood.
      <p>The Overthere can be reached through a pass in the northern edge of the 
        mountains at 4000, 1530. This eventually leaves you in the Overthere at 
        -6000, 1580.
      <p>The Dreadlands are reached through a small tunnel located hidden in the 
        wall of the mountain at location -3675, -3330. This places you at 2340, 
        -3475 in the Dreadlands.
      <p>There is one surface entrance to the goblin underground that leads to 
        Temple of Droga located at approximately 3430, 2880. The entrance to the 
        Mines of Nurga are located through an entrance that is similar in appearance 
        at approximately -2215, -1780.
