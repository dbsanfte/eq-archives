<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">I thought I would describe the process involvedin making one my my maps and guides to people, because I often hear people say something like "i can imagine how long it takes you" or "what you have to do" but I don't think anyone knows.  I'll try to be brief...   :)

Let's use Field of Bone as an example.  When I was in the beta test I ran around mapping this place out with my iksar monk.  Basically I go outside and start running along all the walls in the zone.  I have /loc hotkeyed, and I get /loc's of every corner or change in direction of the wall.  I sketch this all loosely on paper, so when I go back later to draw it I know how it looked.  I label each corner or point of interest sequentially and write the loc's at some other spot on the paper with the numbers attached.  My record was Swamp of No Hope, where I had something like 300 loc's written down.  :P

After I hit all the contours of the zone, I then go hit points of interest within the zone.  In Field of Bone, this is pretty easy since you can see where everything is.  In places like Swamp of No Hope, Warsliks Woods, and Frontier Mountains, you can't see very far, and basically just have to run around a lot and hope that you find everything.  Entrances I typically get one loc.  Ruins, if they're small, I get a loc of the entrance and sketch the shape of it so I know how to lay it out later.  If they're bigger, I take multiple loc's around the outside.  Places like the Pit I could run around the outside just like I did the borders of the zone.  I trace out paths the same way, and mountains if they're really significant.  If there are any merchants, I drop by to see what they sell.

Also, the whole time I'm either tracking or /con'ing monsters to see what they're named as well as what levels they are for my guide.  I fight there if I'm able to, or talk to groups who are if I can't, to figure out the lay of the land (pathing, what monsters are what classes, etc).

After I'm done with all this, I sit down and figure out how big the zone is, print up a piece of my home-made graph paper, and get to work sketching it out.  After the sketch, I ink the stuff that I want to appear in the final map, and then erase off the pencil.  Following that, I break out the colored pencils and color everything in.  I scan it into the computer, import it into Adobe Photoshop where I plunk down all the numbers and loc's around the edges.  I'm usually scanning message boards and other sources of information to find out where certain named mobs spawn and what they drop, since I often have never seen them myself (especially in the higher-level dungeons).

I then write the guide and plunk them all into html pages that you all see.  Dungeons and cities are pretty much the same, although can be easier or harder depending on how much stuff is in them.  Cities have most everything on the square, making it a bit easier to map, but harder to draw (I gotta use a ruler).  Dungeons are harder to map but easier to draw, cuz it's all freehand.

As for how much time this takes...  Relatively simple zones, like say Southern Karana, I could map out in about 2-3 hours if I did it now.  It would take maybe 2-3 hours to draw up and color, and another 2-3 to do the html and computer stuff.  Other zones, like Upper Guk or Swamp of No Hope, each took about 15-25 hours to map out completely.  This is largely because of creature avoidance and deaths, as well as complicated zones (note that all the water in Swamp of No Hope is correctly laid out, ugg).  They take probably ten hours to draw and ink, give or take, and then another 2-3 hours for the computer stuff.  I think Swamp of No Hope wound up taking me 35 hours total to do, and it never would have happened had I not been on vacation when I was in the beta (lucky on that one).

Anyway, hope this interests some of you...
