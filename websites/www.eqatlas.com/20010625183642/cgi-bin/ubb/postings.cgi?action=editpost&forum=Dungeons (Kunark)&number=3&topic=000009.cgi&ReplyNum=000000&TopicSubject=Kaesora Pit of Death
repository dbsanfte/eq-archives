<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">My Guild recently made a Journey into Kaesora
The outcome - I personally died 8 times

But before we go there let me tell you about the group that went in.  we went in as 2 groups of 4.  
shadow knight 43
paladin 40
shadow knight 40
cleric 50
necromancer 32
shaman 31
warrior 30
cleric 29

the first set of deaths were caused by some of us (myself included) not knowing how to get down the pit.  It has two levels worth of a drop, and some of us fell to the very bottom, as we did not know how to jump in, or realize there where 2 lvls we could fall to.  end result all but 2 died ( they gated )
corpse retrival caused me 3 more deaths, as invis would fade, and there are 10 to 15 spiders there that mob you as soon as that happens.  But I eventually pulled all the corpse to were they could be pulled to the top lvl in stages.

next we try going to the library, working our way slowly around.  we end up in the long hallway infront of the library.  the SK is pulling from there clearing the path.  when a train of 5 spiders ( who are NO WHERE NEAR where we were hunting show up. will the SK had pulled a couple of mobs from the library area.  

end result - we all die again

another hour and a half of courpse retrival later we actually get into the library! woo hoo ! we are there.  Very nice looking area btw.

here we realize that we have to redo our groups, as we were getting there we found that half the Mobs in the zone would decrease Ventril faction.  for those who are not an evil race, this is not a problem.  But for those of us who are it is very bad.  Ventril faction is with the ONLY evil accessible city in Kunark.  You let this get to bad and you have to take a very long boat ride back to Antonica to do any banking etc.  also you will never buy those high lvl spells ( if you can ever reach that lvl )

so we change up the grouping to a good group and an evil group.  seemed to be working fairly well, until once again a train from no where appears.  ( there were no pets at all to train them to us, and we never left to room )   3 times when inside the room this happened while I was there.

eventually I had to log along with a couple of others, leaving a group of 6
43 Sk
40 paly
40 sk
40 cleric
30 warrior
29 cleric

they lost their bodies again.

then 2 lvl 55's came in, a cleric and a chanter.  they went with my friends to the library rezed them all. and while they were discussing the best way to get out, once again the train.

they all died

now, if we as a group of lvl 30 to 40 attack a lvl 55 the out come is we die.  How can a group of low 30 mobs take out 4 lvl 40's 2 lvl 55s ( even discounting the others )
it is not like there were 2 to one odds in the mobs favor.  and WTF is with the trains showing from nowhere land?

Needless to say I will never go into Kaesora again, there is nothing there that is worth it to me.  the only way I will return would be if be some miracle I ever get to 55, and return with my friends with them at lvl 60 and just kill everything there.

but then again....... the trains may come and how do I know we would not all die again?

sorry bout the huge rant.

the main thing I wanted people to get from this was the bad faction for evil races 

and the ridiculous trains from the twilight zone.

Muse's maps say this zone is good for a group of mid to high 30's.  I do not agree....
