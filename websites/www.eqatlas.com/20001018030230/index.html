            <blockquote> 
              <p>I went through some of my email and put up some updates, most 
                of which is from the latest patch and the new beings incorporated 
                into it. I've also decided that with all the new NPC's around 
                and their items, I'm going to list them in the main map page, 
                but they aren't going to be noted on the maps at all. I try to 
                walk the line and not be a spoiler site, but trying to figure 
                out which NPC's to include and which not to is too hard, I'll 
                include them but am not too interested in where they are.</p>
              <p>Also, I'll have the drawing for the Game Voices tomorrow (Monday) 
                afternoon when I get home from work. All you have to do to have 
                a chance to win is sign up for the <a href="http://www.eqatlas.com/cgi-bin/ubb/Ultimate.cgi?action=intro">Forums</a>!</p>
              <p>Also, wanted to clarify a few points on my comments about the 
                character banning. I've heard back from some people, and got copies 
                of the stories to read (don't ask, I'm not sending them to anyone). 
                The story that is worse is about the rape of a fourteen-year-old 
                girl, who winds up killing her rapist. There was some discussion 
                about the fact it stated she was &quot;fourteen seasons&quot; 
                but it is clear that this means how old she is and not how many 
                levels she is.</p>
              <p>Someone pointed out the position IGN was in with removing the 
                messages, and I agree with IGN, I would have removed them from 
                my boards as well. You can't have stuff like that posted freely 
                on a site, because someone could sue me for posting it, but not 
                him for writing it. Don't ask me to explain. My problem comes 
                when Verant says it is a &quot;derivative work&quot; and bans 
                him. It's kind of like the &quot;it's not you, it's me&quot; line 
                in breakups, we all know it's a lie. It is a lie, however, that 
                gets Verant out of a sticky legal problem with the free speech 
                part of it.</p>
              <p>For those of you who wrote to disagree, and state that free speech 
                doesn't apply to him, you don't get free speech. It applies whether 
                or not you like what he said, whether or not you want to read 
                it or not. Using your own argument, I could say that you don't 
                have the right to tell me you think I'm wrong, and that just doesn't 
                make sense.</p>

            <blockquote> 
              <p>Verant recently banned a player for posting, on EQ Vault's message 
                boards, <a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?topic=7048656&amp;replies=7">this 
                story</a>. I'm not sure if this info is accurate, however, and 
                I think the actual post has been removed, and involves the death 
                and rape of a fourteen-year-old DE boy. It's kind of irrelevant 
                to me, actually, which story it was.</p>
              <p>I'm honestly practically speechless that Verant would pull something 
                like this. They are obviously exercising their right to ban anyone 
                for any reason, but now I'm worried that I too could be banned 
                for speaking out against the Company. I've removed my section 
                describing what characters I play so they have a harder time tracking 
                me down.</p>
              <p>Verant has no moral right to ban this person. I'm sure that they 
                think that they do. Free speech isn't simply a legal protection, 
                it's something that people should inherently believe in, regardless 
                of the law. Voltaire got that, but apparently the other big V 
                does not.</p>
              <p>I'm gonna quit typing now and go camp out the Post Office for 
                my AO Beta CD.</p>
