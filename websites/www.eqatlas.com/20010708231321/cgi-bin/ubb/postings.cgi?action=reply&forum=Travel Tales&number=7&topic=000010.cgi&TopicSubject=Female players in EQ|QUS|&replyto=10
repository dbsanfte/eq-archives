[B]I just bought the game and the lady at electronic's botique said that she is addicted to it. She said that she got all of her female friends who dont normally play games into it as well. I cant get my GF to try it because she hates how much time video games take away from me seeing her, she formed her oppinion a long time ago. But if she would just try it she would understand. My perfect woman is one that got my back in a battle. well, would sure beat chatting using instant messager anyway.

Or is it just a myth. My friend and I were debating this the other day. <P>My guess is that a lot of "female characters" are played by guys. My friend (who does not play EQ) predicts that there are many ladies who actually play EQ. His reasoning is that women stay away from action or twitch games like Quake or Unreal or Starcraft, and he theorizes that the few ladies who DO play online games will be attracted to more involed social or role-playing games and often thinking/puzzle games. <BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Mysticalone</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><BR>I just wanted to say I am a female playing EQ, and love it!

(Or whatever game it might be) Where men are men, and so are 99 percent of the females."<P>No, dere are a few dat run in game dat are females. Indeed it am rare to say da least. As far as if da one ju mite me flurting with is a female or not, well, it is a role playing game. If dey wants to role play a female who cares. Dis not a "Cybersex" game, or a place to "pick up chicks" for god's sake. First off, if ju has to pick up chicks in a online game, ju purty pathetic, and second, ain't it real hard to has cybersex anyway, I mean,  are you real guud at typing wif one hand?  heheh sheese....<P>------------------<BR>Torn Asunder, BlackJujuMojoMakinVoodooCastinOgrenShadowKnight of 46th Scar.

A GM was the master of ceremonies for that event, so it was a fairly well publicized event. <P>Im not sure if this "wedding" was only in-game role playing, or if the couple are actually in love with each other and found each other while playing EQ. <P>The funniest part of the in-game wedding was, they were betrothed at Innorruuk's Temple of Hate in Neriak. Twisted people LOL<P>P.S. I wouldnt be surprised if the next in-game "wedding" was a matchup between an Iksar shadow knight and his wood elf lover. <P></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">LeeLei</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Im a female player in EverQuest, got hooked my some male friends and Im now addicted to "EverCrack".

I have one male character, and two female characters.  Why do I play female characters?  Two easy reasons:<P>#1 They are more fun to look at while you play.<P>#2 Other male characters tend to GIVE YOU STUFF.  <P>My female wood elf was in the game a total of 30 SECONDS (no joke) before she was handed two cutthroat rings and a shield.<P>And yes, to give you all the willies, I WILL flirt with male characters in the game . . .and my wife has taught me how to do it VERY well . . . muhahahahahaaa . . .</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Cressida</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I am a real life female as well, brought to the game by a husband and wife team that adore it.  On the other hand, I also have many friends that are male who have female characters of low and very high levels. Mainly because there are certain advantages (as they see it) to having the cleavage. IE/ more apt to get gifts from other players, etc.  Strangely, the same reason why myself and some other real life females chose to make sideline male characters....hmmmmm....<P>Cressida lvl 14 druid (Keepers of the Fiery Myste)</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">smells_like_fish</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">omg timar you sound like a fag and its not even funny</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Lord Phule</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Too bad there's not a "/IRL" command to give you the age and sex of the player.

Personally, my wife would never play EQ, but I have totally enjoyed the month I've been playing EQ.  I am male, but play 2 female characters.  I started with a wood elf ranger, and now have started a dwarf paladin.  I just enjoy the opportunity to play a character that is somewhat different from the norm.
