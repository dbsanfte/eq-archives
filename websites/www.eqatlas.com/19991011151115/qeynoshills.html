<h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>

<p>Qeynos Hills is an area one step above the newbie area of North Qeynos, and provides good hunting for the levels above, although it can be heavily trafficked at times with monks looking to get their putrid bones and others looking for pelts.  It is a small and easy zone to get around once you get your bearings, and is the hub of activity on the western coast of Antonica.

<h3><font size=+2>D</font>angers </h3>

<p>The danger with this zone, as with other zones, is that there are aggressive monsters wandering around that you don't want to get into a tangle with at too low a level.  For instance, skeletons and grizzly bears, as well as rabid wolves are very deadly to many, and probably result in most of the deaths of people in this area.

<p>Another danger are the two ranger NPC's wandering the zone.  I haven't found a use for them, but can't count the number of times I've cursed them for killing me when I was attacked by a rabid wolf.  You see, they take it upon themselves to keep "poachers" out of the area, which includes any character fighting either a wolf or bear, regardless of who started the fight.  Keep your eyes peeled for these if you run into problems with either of those two monsters, and consider carefully the benefits of hunting wolves in this area, because they are harder to avoid than bears and will attack you constantly, and the two rangers don't care who picked on who, they'll kill you.

<p>Gnasher also wanders through the zone randomly, usually around the entrance to Blackburrow.  He has never attacked me personally, and he doesn't move too quickly, but if you hear the cry "Gnasher by BB" be sure to /con the gnoll you are attacking to make sure it isn't him.  The people hiding at the zone edge to BB aren't going to be grateful if you run Gnasher to them and zone to escape him.

<p>There is also a necromancer that is occasionally aggressive in the area, although I haven't run into problems with him since the beta, but I see him occasionally.

<p>Last but not least, putrid skeletons and dread corpses sometimes make appearances in the form of trains heading to Surefall Glade.  I myself had quite an impressive one with at least four putrids and two dreads when I was helping my monk friend get the bones (which he never did get).  Listen to /shout's and keep your eyes peeled.

<h3><font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>

<p>There is a wide range of monsters of low levels to fight in this area, and it offers a good area to fight some 2nd level monsters that is away from the big city hustle and bustle of North Qeynos. Included in the mix are fire beetles, whose eyes are a boon to all who can't see at night, and will sell for a pretty penny on faraway places like Faydwer (although I'm not sure why, every character that can start there has infravision or ultravision).

<p>This is a good area to get both small and large pelts for making patchwork leather armor (read wolf and bear pelts).  The only problem is that there aren't many people around this area who use small patchwork armor, so killing wolves in order to make it means you'll be selling it back to merchants for not much profit and manage to irritate the local rangers at the same time.

<p>The zone is also relatively small, making it good for fleeing to zone edges to escape pursuing monsters.

  <font size=+2>Q</font>eynos <font size=+2>H</font>ills</h3>

<p>From the North, Qeynos Hill is reached through Blackburrow, home of the Blackburrow Gnolls.  This can be a dangerous place, and probably shouldn't be travelled by those less than about 4th or 5th level, you can still fly through as long as you keep your eyes peeled for trouble.  On the other side is Everfrost and the barbarian home of Halas.  Also to the North is Surefall Glade, home of the rangers and druids of the area.  The area in front of Surefall Glade is a good newbie area, and generally less crowded than the one next to Qeynos.

<p>From the South, Qeynos Hills is entered by coming out of North Qeynos, a city of humans and half-elves.

<p>From the East, access is through the Western Plains of Karana, a higher level zone for people greater than 4th level.  The lands beyond are even more dangerous, so don't think you can sneak through unless you're like me, a Bard on the wings of my drum.
