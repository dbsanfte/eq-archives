<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">Other sites have recently posted something that Gordon said, I've included the relevant bits here:

[b]As far as camping goes, about all we determined is that people differ widely in opinion on the issue. One of the most common suggestions is that we work actively to promote more rewards for playing the game in the preferred manner, and leave rewards as they currently exist for camping.

Unfortunately, doing that would require making playing the game in the preferred manner easier, safer, faster, or more profitable, which would in our opinion decrease the fun to be had from it. In our opinion, there is more fun to be had from playing the game in the preferred manner than by camping, and that fun should be the sufficient additional reward to get people to do it.

However it's obviously not, so we're left with reducing the reward for camping as an option. Of course, many made it clear in the threads they they prefer camping over doing anything else in the game. Hence our quandry.[/b]

He goes on to say that they're not going to make any changes. You can find the full post [URL=http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008246.html]here[/URL].

I thought I'd discuss this. Reading through the above post carefully, I've determined that the true flaw at Verant is that their use of logic is basically non-existent. In a nutshell, they've stated that the way they [i]intended[/i] the game is that the benefit of "fun" that you obtain by playing the game the right way should balance out the other benefits of camping (better loot, more money, slower pace), "however it's obviously not." You're correct on that one, Gordon.

However, he goes on to state that the possible correction to that, making it "easier, safer, faster, or more profitable" would actually [i]decrease[/i] our enjoyment of the game. Call me crazy, but if he made those changes, everyone I know in game wouldn't have been upset they didn't get into the [URL=http://www.anarchy-online.com]AO beta[/URL] (myself included). That's exactly what people want, and if Verant did that, it seems in line with their Vision where the preferred method was more fun.

However, Gordon goes on to state that they can't do that. ?? Which leaves them with nerfing, if you will, camping. ?? They don't want to do that because some people apparently actually [i]enjoy[/i] camping (and cuz 50,000 accounts being cancelled in one day would really hurt the bottom line), so they're going to leave things the way they are.

In a nutshell, what Gordon is saying is this: [b]Doing a dungeon, as per our Vision, turned out to not be as fun or rewarding as we planned. We cannot enhance this, because that would, trust us on this one, actually [i]decrease[/i] your fun. The only option to make it more fun than camping would, in fact, be to make camping even less fun. Since we don't want you all to have less fun, you can plainly see how we are forced to make no changes.[/b]

It sounds like the Sicilian in the Princess Bride. And I don't think Verant could come up with a way to make camping even less fun (I know I can't), so that's not really an option. The only way what he said above makes any sense is if you pay attention to where he stuck "in our opinion."  If you do, then it comes clear that Verant thinks it's more fun to do it the right way and you should do it for that reason, however people for reasons  unknown to them simply don't. This is what we in the field of  logic describe as a state of being [i]wrong[/i].

Feel free to discuss.
