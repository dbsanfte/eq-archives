      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      <p>The Western Plains of Karana are on the route from Qeynos area and the 
        west coast of Antonica to the east. There is one major path that dips 
        to the south of the mountain region at the northern edge, connecting Qeynos 
        Hills and the Plains to the east. 
      <p>A river forms the southern boundary of the zone, and mountains the northern 
        boundary. Both areas have people of interest. The north hides a camp of 
        ogres and bandits in the hills. The south has a camp of entrepeneurial 
        barbarians as well as the creeping hordes of undead that are slowly spreading 
        over the land. And throughout it all, bandits are trying to reclaim this 
        area as theirs. 
      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>angers </h3>
      <p>This area can be very dangerous, although there aren't many creatures 
        wandering around that are aggressive to you outright. It's more of an 
        area where creatures attack you based on what you've done to them, the 
        only exceptions being hill giants and grizzly bears. The other monsters, 
        including the lions, wolves, and bears (oh my) will attack you only if 
        you've developed a reputation for killing one or more of them, and it's 
        hard not to in this part of Antonica, although I've heard that the lions 
        are aggressive to just about everyone, regardless of this.
      <p>If you haven't attacked one of these monsters, you simply have to keep 
        your eyes peeled for either the grizzly or the hill giant, and realize 
        that if the hill giant attacks you, the two guards at a tower will likely 
        be killed by it before they save you. 
      <p>This area is also very vast, and has creatures that you see only rarely 
        and only in selected corners of the zone. For instance, there is a treant 
        that occasionally wanders through the zone, who doesn't attack anyone 
        (unless you are evil or it catches you hunting bears, and then watch out). 
        There are also bandits that will attack you on sight, and a clan of ogres 
        with a named ogre amongst them, who con amiable but are really only happy 
        to see you because they're bored and want to kill something new. They 
        are part of an evil quest, and will kill most people on sight, evil or 
        not. There are also demolished camps where powerful skeletons and zombies 
        live, usually further south and east near the river. All of these areas 
        are considered dangerous, but in truth most of the hunting occurs in the 
        western half of the zone, where it is more of a "plains" atmosphere and 
        these monsters don't hang out. 
      <h3><font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>
      <p>This is the only area on the western coast, other than Everfrost Peaks, 
        for collecting cat pelts to make medium sized patchwork armor. If you 
        are human, this is where you must come to get those pelts and make that 
        armor. You can also find wolf and bear pelts here. 
      <p>This is not an area with a great deal of wealth, as, for now, killing 
        the large bugs doesn't get you any booty. You'll make more money killing 
        fire beetles. Lions will make you some gold, however, as they occasionally 
        have high quality pelts which you can sell for several gold. It is a great 
        area, however, for hunting for days on end, as you can buy food in this 
        area as well as sell your goods for pretty good prices. The guards don't 
        run patrols, but they are always within a very short range from their 
        tower and they can really save you from that train of grizzlies. 
      <p>This area is also very undertravelled. There are usually no more than 
        20 people here in all the times that I've been on, and if you have a ranger, 
        or are one, your hunting could be quite good since the biggest problem 
        with hunting here is finding creatures in this vastness. 
      <h3><font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
        <font size=+2>W</font>estern <font size=+2>P</font>lains <font size=+2>O</font>f 
        <font size=+2>K</font>arana</h3>
      <p>To the West there is only one entrance, and that is from the Qeynos Hills, 
        and opens into the northern aspect of the western border, adjacent to 
        a small hamlet which sells goods. 
      <p>To the East there are two roads that exit from this zone, but the whole 
        border edge can be used and is sometimes difficult to escape from if you 
        get turned around (my personal max is zoning five times here after getting 
        spun around). There is one road north by the mountains and another south 
        by the river. The latter one opens close to the bridge leading to Southern 
        Plains of Karana.
