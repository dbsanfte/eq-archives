      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      <p>The tower appears to be something of a school for the undead. There are 
        at least seven levels, all of which require a key to move higher, that 
        have undead on every floor. The tower's history is shrouded in mystery, 
        but it appears that the once-living members of the tower were brought 
        here to remain safe during the Erudite/Heretic war, but something unknown 
        came to pass and left them cursed to remain here forever. </p>
      <h3>Info by Level</h3>
      <p>The keys are needed to go between every level as you move higher and 
        higher into the tower. None of the keys are soulbound, so be prepared 
        with an evac in case you lose your keyholder. The keys are used by using 
        the key on a mirror, which will teleport your group to the next level. 
        There are also exit mirrors located on every floor that will teleport 
        you to a place outside the tower if you need to leave. All the keys are 
        no drop. There is no key needed to get from level 6A to 6B (which is why 
        they're both called level 6). The mirrors do not count as zone lines, 
        which means that when you pass through them, you retain the aggro of creatures 
        you left behind. They will eventually find a way to reach you, and usually 
        with a rather large group of friends to help them out. Do not flee by 
        using the mirrors (unless you go outside).</p>
      <p>The first level consists of a lot of shadowbone skeletons as well as 
        the other undead listed. The Large Undead Gnoll who drops the key to the 
        next level spawns after killing any of the shadowbones or undead gnolls 
        anywhere on the level, although is far more common off of shadowbones. 
        Occasionally killing the Large Undead Gnoll will cause three shadowbones 
        or shadow beasts to spawn. There is also a portal to the 7th level, but 
        that requires the highest level key to enter. Monsters here are 28th-31st 
        level. The center of the floor has a large pit which is easy to fall into 
        because the floor is very slippery, although levitate will negate the 
        effect. Three shadowbones await you in the pit, which is also difficult 
        to get out of because of the slipperiness of the floor.</p>
      <p>The second level (the &quot;Library&quot;) appears to be a school filled 
        with students and librarians. All of the creatures here appear like ghostly 
        erudites, humans, and dwarves. Killing students will get the Angry Librarian 
        to spawn, who holds the key to the third level. There is also a secret 
        bookcase in the northwest corner which leads to a mirror that will take 
        you outside. Monsters here in 30th-34th level. Virtually all of the creatures 
        on this level are casters. There is a trapped bookcase next to the entry, 
        which can be disarmed.</p>
      <p>The third level (the Servant's Quarters) is filled with various types 
        of undead, mostly armored shadows and others. Killing the Enraged Shadowbeast 
        will get you the key to the next level. There is a mirror here that is 
        in the room with a bed that will take you to the outside. Monsters here 
        are roughly 30th-43rd level. This level is confusing because of many long 
        corridors and false walls.</p>
      <p>The fourth level (the Crypt) has mummies, oozes, and shadows. The room 
        is mazelike, and one can easily get lost down dead ends in it. A key to 
        the fourth floor is required to reach the mirror to exit the tower, which 
        is located behind a white door right near the entrance. There are several 
        rares that spawn in an area near the exit (near the coffin) that give 
        some very good loot. Killing Amonpheta is required to get Cara to appear 
        for the key.</p>
      <p>The fifth level (the Wedding) has many undead wedding participants that 
        appear anywhere in the zone. The significant NPCs also appear anywhere 
        in the zone. The bride (Daman) and the groom (Nosja) spawn most of the 
        notable loot on this level, and appear in one fixed place with the priest. 
        The mirror to take you back outside is located right where you appear 
        in the zone. The key to the sixth floor drops from an enraged relative.</p>
      <p><b>Note</b> on the following two level areas, some people refer to the 
        top two areas as levels 6, 7, and 8. Others refer to them as level 6 (which 
        has two areas) and a level 7. Be aware of this because when someone says 
        level 6 or 8, you can be pretty sure of what they're talking about, but 
        if they say level 7 clarify if they mean the final level or not. I will 
        refer to them as 6A and 6B and level 7.</p>
      <p>The sixth level is divided into two separate areas (A and B). There are 
        two areas, separated by a mirror that doesn't require a key to get through. 
        Upon entering level 6, you are in area 6A and you can go to the right 
        or to the left. To the left takes you to an area where there are Icy Shades, 
        which you must kill in order to get the Ice Shade to spawn, which is a 
        shade that summons a pet and appears as an old-world spectre (unlike the 
        rest of this tower). Killing that monster will get Vhal'Sera to spawn 
        in area 6B. This first area is also where the special Spirits spawn, and 
        is also the location of some nasty traps, particularly the trap on the 
        dragon statue near the exit mirror. Going to the right after the entrance 
        takes you up several stairs to a ledge overlooking the shade area. Walking 
        too close to the edge will make all these shades aggro, so be careful. 
        Passing through the mirror there requires no key and takes you to 6B which 
        is where Vhal'Sera drops the key for the seventh level. In this area are 
        shrouded bats which spawn enraged vampires immediately upon their deaths. 
        Vhal'Sera itself is highly magic resistant. </p>
      <p>The seventh level is the home of the most powerful monster in the Tower, 
        Tserrina. This area is much smaller than many of the other levels, and 
        consists of essentially a long corridor, with a large spiral staircase 
        inside that leads to another small area. In the area where you enter the 
        spiral staircase room is a tapestry, which is a fake wall. Behind this 
        wall is the area where Tserrina appears, randomly appearing after one 
        of the bats in the area appear. Tserrina is a very difficult creature 
        to defeat, because she is highly resistant to all spells with the exception 
        of some lure spells. She drops a key that can be used to bypass all the 
        keys on all the floors, so that you can pass through the alternate mirror 
        on level one and go directly to level seven.</p>
      <p>There is also possibly an 8th level to the tower which requires a quest 
        to obtain the key to enter. Nobody has the found this quest or key, and 
        the floor, quest, and key are not in the game at present time.</p>
