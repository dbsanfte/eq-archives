<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">What utter nonsense spouted by what must be elitist 'gamers'.  One is forced to wonder if you all live in your own little world.

Everquest is a mass market product.  It isn't marketed just for an elite few who have the money and inclination to stay ahead of the curve in equipment and software.  It is marketed to people like my son, who plays his games on admittedly older hardware because that is what the family has available for him.  It is marketed to anyone who picks up the box, thinks it is neat to hack and slash a little, and has minimum requirements considerably short of the new requirements.

Is it reasonable for Verant to fail to implement new technology in their games?  Of course not, and no one would expect them to.  But unlike stand alone products, which can be played forever on the machine you had, online games involve a relationship between the purchaser and the seller.  I'm not able to simply play Everquest whenever I want to and my machine is free; I have to be able to log on and use the servers.  In essence, I've bought not a game, but the ability to play the game.

But it isn't reasonable, let alone intelligent, for the game provider to say to everyone already involved: ok, you've shelled out money for the game, you've invested money in playing the game for x months, now you can either pony up a better system or you can't ever play our game again.  My son doesn't have money just lying around, and investing it in making his computer able to play one particular game is nonsense.  While there are a few titles out there that he can't play, the vast majority of games are runnable on his system.  Having purchased a game that said it only required a certain system to work, where is it fair that he and others like him be forced to lose the value of that purchase?  And please note, there isn't anything obvious about the game or its packaging that would make you think as you purchased it that you were going to have to spend money down the road to play it.

What, then, is a reasonable compromise between these two ideas?  I think the reasonable compromise would be to dedicate some servers to the older version of the game, and other servers to the newer version. Certainly it would be possible for Verant to have servers service the old gamecode while upgrading the game on most servers to the newer standard?  Eventually, as the number of gamers who wanted to limit themselves to the old standards decreased, the number of such servers could be decreased as well.  Everyone wins.

As it stands, Verant's approach to the application of DirectX 7.0a is most likely to do one thing: turn off potential buyers of the game and the new expansion pack.  Meanwhile, my son is enjoying other experiences, and has cancelled his Everquest account, as will I when they eventually make it impossible for me to play on my machine.</TEXTAREA>
