      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      <p>The Estate of Unrest was once the home of a dwarven noble, in ages past. 
        Following the unholy destruction that created Dagnor's Cauldron and the 
        following takeover of that region by evil creatures, his estate was overrun 
        by the undead, and is now one of the great havens of the unliving in all 
        of Norrath. 
      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>angers </h3>
      <p>Unrest is a small outdoor estate occupied from top to bottom with undead. 
        The only principal areas of note in the estate are the manorhouse, the 
        yard, and the maze. The manorhouse has five levels, including the basement.
      <p>Trains here deserve special mention. A great deal of the hunting in the 
        zone consists of pulling from the house, where some lucky individual runs 
        into the house, whacks a nearby monster, and runs back out with monster 
        in tow. The problem is that these monsters sometimes don't always follow 
        you. They will occasionally take circuits around the house gathering their 
        friends to come with them (&quot;Let's go have a picnic in the gazebo!&quot;) 
        or there are other undead within aggro range when you pull. The end result 
        is that very often there are overpulls from the house to the yard. Now, 
        when this happens, usually a train results, and people fighting along 
        one of the walls runs for the entrance. The phenomenon are unique to this 
        zone. The first is that the entryway tunnel is very long. If a train has 
        entered that tunnel, it's safest to wait for it to come back out and disperse 
        rather than go in after it. You will catch it coming back out and likely 
        be torn to bits. The other problem is that often, because of the pathing 
        in the zone, trains will seem to take a little trip around the outside 
        of the yard, especially the higher level trains. One of these trains will 
        result in there being about five people in the tower wondering where everyone 
        else went.
      <p>The yard is a very busy part of the zone. There are roaming monsters 
        all over this area, mostly lower level creatures, and the death beetles. 
        Groups pull from the house and fight monsters, mostly along the back and 
        west walls. Dangers in this area are mostly the trains (as described above) 
        and the death beetles. The death beetles will attack anyone fighting in 
        this area. At high levels, they are a constant nuisance, but at lower 
        levels they can be downright dangerous, and many of us have handily fought 
        off undead only to be nibbled away at by several death beetles.
      <p>The first floor of the house is where most of the people pull to the 
        yard from. Mostly high-teens level monsters wander around here, nothing 
        special. The second floor has some higher level creatures, but otherwise 
        the only thing of note is the Reclusive Ghoul Magi room in the back, and 
        a NPC named Krix that spawns in a closet near the Magi room. Krix may 
        be involved in a quest, although details are unknown at present (by me, 
        at least). The third floor contains the barroom, which is also busy. Although 
        a good place to camp, the barroom is so close to the tower above, that 
        you really need to have a group camping each room. What happens otherwise 
        is that if you attack someone in the barroom, the entire tower runs down 
        the stairs to help out. You better order a drink when you hear them pounding 
        down the stairs. The tower is a little safer, and is kind of out of the 
        way. You generally don't have to deal with much else when you're up there. 
        The other area of interest all the way on top of the manor is the Hand 
        Room, where the hand spawns. This room is a nice spot to camp, as it is 
        out of the way of all but the craziest trains (Puller -- &quot;I know, 
        I'll run out through the hand room, that will work!&quot;). It is also 
        a quick escape, as you can run out on the balcony and onto the roof of 
        the patio and it's a straight shot to the zone.
      <p>The basement is a different matter. The basement is a deathtrap to someone 
        by themselves or in a group that doesn't know what they're doing. The 
        monsters, many of which are the dangerous Festering Hags, spawn down here 
        in groups and quickly. The pace is fast but the experience may make it 
        worth it (assuming you don't die much). Mortuary fungus here are also 
        lethal, as they have a tendency to cast drowsiness on the melee types, 
        making it very difficult to take them out without some magical backup. 
        In the end of the basement is the dwarven ghost, who spawns some of the 
        rarest items in the zone. He is protected by a room full of the toughest 
        monsters in the zone, all of whom will swarm you if you don't kill them 
        off first... 
      <h3><font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>
      <p>The Estate of Unrest is one of the great zones in the game. I have friends 
        and know a lot of people who essentially lived there for ten levels. It 
        is a fast-paced, dangerous zone, but that is also what makes it fun. People 
        can gain experience quicker than many other places in here, and also become 
        rich while doing so. A lot of the mainstay items in the game come out 
        of Unrest, so there's a ready market for your excess loot.
      <p>The other benefit, and something that is probably key to its success, 
        is that the zone is broken up into specific areas designed for various 
        levels. The rooms are designed for characters of a certain level range, 
        and if you fit that range, you're going to have a good time there.
      <h3><font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
        <font size=+2>U</font>nrest</h3>
      <p>The Estate of Unrest is reached by passing through the length of Dagnor's 
        Cauldron to a small tunnel on the south end. Most people run along the 
        west end of the lake close to the water, but you need to be careful of 
        the numerous aqua goblins moving throughout the area.
