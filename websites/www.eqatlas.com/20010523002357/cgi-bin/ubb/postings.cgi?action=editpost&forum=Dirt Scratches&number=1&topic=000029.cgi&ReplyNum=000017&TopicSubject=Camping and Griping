<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">On Ladel's comments:

I can see how what they said could be interpreted this way.  My hangup is more with their argument, where they state that their intent was to make it more fun to do the game the preferred way, but for whatever reason this isn't fun to people.  This could also be interpreted as saying that, although it is more fun, people still don't do it because it isn't as profitable as camping (in terms of whatever measure you use, exp, gold, etc.).

My problem, I guess, is more with the fact that they assume that they would have to make a huge change to the game in order to make the preferred method more profitable (or more fun) so that people would do it more.  All I'm asking for is that they make it even possible to do things the preferred way.

One thing that stops this is the huge level variation in dungeons.  For instance, in Blackburrow the people who get exp at the top get butchered at the bottom, and the bottom people walk through the top with impunity.  Many of the Kunark dungeons are a lot better about this than the original ones.

The other problem, though, and in my opinion the biggest one, is the fact that the game, despite having a "preferred method" of doing the dungeon, is in fact designed for people to camp.  Spawns and drops are static, so people looking for a particular item go to that room and set up shop.  This means that even if you were to try to do the dungeon, you'd have vast areas of the "trash" to fight through, punctuated by rooms where the cool stuff spawns, but is now filled with some group.

This has led to something of a mini arms race where, because things were set up statically from the beginning, Verant had to come up with a way of making it a challenge for the people who might camp them.  This process is where we got NPC's with infinite mana, who can run while casting, who seem to resist our spells with impunity, who have no damage caps, etc.

The side effect of this is that it is now mostly impossible to "do" a dungeon the way they intended because of static spawns and camping.  In the perfect dungeon (e.g. Najena, which is do-able), basically your group would have to go from room-to-room breaking spawns all along the way, a process which we all know is the most dangerous step in any dungeon.  Although this *is* fun, the simple fact is that you will probably die at one point doing this, simply because you are engaging in this high-risk behavior of perpetually fighting hordes of super-powerful monsters.  What was fun a moment ago now becomes painful, because now you have to do corpse recovery in a dungeon in which, for balance purposes, many monsters can see through invis, invis drops with little warning, a mix of undead and regular and no stacking of appropriate spells makes it hard, doors are locked with keys on bodies, an unspaced spawn could refill the room within 30 seconds, making it a death trap while you loot your body, etc.  Oh, and there are not many times that a high-level cleric or paladin is even in these lower zones to come exp rez you, mitigating that danger.  Even in higher level zones they simply can't leave their group and come to you, nor can you safely drag to them.

The whole point is that you cannot do dungeons in all but a very few select ones (Dalnir, Kaesora, Najena, for instance).  Even stating that it's fun but not as rewarding is ignoring the fact that it's simply not possible.  I guess it technically is if you really don't mind dying and losing half a bubble of exp (i.e. 1-2 hours of time, not counting CR), but that doesn't cut it for me.  A correction to make it "easier, safer, faster, or more profitable" might actually make this stuff possible.  I also realize that it would make camping easier (cuz people would just "camp" the "doing" of a dungeon, sadly).

Now, I also know the counterargument to what I stated above, which Verant time and time again uses, and that is that people who are willing to take the higher associated risk and the penalties involved with that risk should, by virtue of their (bravery?) reap the benefits.  This does make sense when seen from a certain angle, but let me propose a different possibility:

People bought this game to have fun.  For some people, feeling like they've overcome a huge adversity is fun.  For some people, finishing the game in one week or less is fun.  For some people, simply the playing of it is fun.  I count myself as one of the latter people, and obviously no one game will satisfy all three groups.  However, I think there is a middle-ground to all of this.  I, when I started this game, thought someday I'd fight a dragon or a god, especially if I put in enough energy and time.  I personally feel the game would be just as much fun if, instead of taking 200 hours of play time (that's a time pulled out of a hat) to hit 50th, it instead took only 50-75 hours.  This game, though, caters to the extreme one end of the spectrum where you must devote your life to hitting 50th in order to see some of the coolest parts of the world.  I think everyone who buys the game should be able to do that, and the way it is now we can't, and Verant is okay with that, and that's what bugs me.
