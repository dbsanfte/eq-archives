      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      <p>Freeport is considered by most to be the hub of Antonica for a variety 
        of reasons. It is the mercantile center of the continent, since it holds 
        the only port with a regular boat to the island continent of Faydwer. 
        It holds facilities for most of the artisan trades, and most budding craftsman 
        travel to Freeport to take advantage of the readily available facilities. 
        Freeport is also the hub for traffic of all sorts. The good races travel 
        its streets to go to their guilds and the shops, as well as to the boat 
        to Faydwer, and the dark races travel through the sewers to reach most 
        of the same destinations. Guild Halls for all classes except the Rangers, 
        Druids, and Shamans are present within the city. 
      <h3><font size=+2>S</font>urrounding <font size=+2>A</font>reas</h3>
      <p>Freeport lies at the intersection of several notable areas of Antonica. 
        To the west of Freeport lies the Commonlands, a vast tract of forested 
        plains that are ringed by desert. In that direction lie the other large 
        cities of the humans, Highhold Keep and Qeynos, and more distantly the 
        homes of the barbarians and the Erudites. 
      <p>To the south of Freeport lies the vast Desert of Ro, which stretches 
        south until it reaches the swamps of the ogres and trolls. This vast untamed 
        desert still holds the sand giants and Dervish Cutthroats that have made 
        it dangerous to travel for generations. 
      <p>To the east of Freeport lies the vast Ocean of Tears, and it is over 
        this ocean that the ships of the humans travel to provide trade to the 
        distant land of the dwarves, elves, and gnomes. 
      <h3><font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
        <font size=+2>F</font>reeport</h3>
      <p>Freeport can be reached from the east from across the Ocean of Tears 
        by the ships that regularly travel the route. From the south, one travels 
        to the Northern Desert of Ro and from there into East Freeport. From the 
        west, one travels to the easternmost part of the Commonlands, and from 
        there into West Freeport. 
      <h3><font size=+2>L</font>ocal <font size=+2>C</font>olor</h3>
      <p><b>Places</b> 
      <p>Freeport is a city of many layers, both good and bad, as one would expect 
        from a town so busy and so large. The tunnels beneath the city allow the 
        dark races to connect to the various areas of the city, including their 
        dark guilds as well as the docks. Certain parts of the city are relatively 
        unsafe, the worst is in East Freeport at the bazaar. The guards in the 
        area are unaware of what goes on just below the surface, and one will 
        commonly see dark elves travelling through the area. This is also where 
        the surface access to the guilds hidden from the rest of the city are 
        located. 
      <p>Other places of note are the Temple of Mithaniel Marr in North Freeport, 
        which is laid out in the whitest granite, and very different than the 
        rest of the city, as well as the guild hall of the magic users, a wonderful 
        floating structure over a small pond, with teleporters as its only access. 
        Most of the shops lie in North Freeport around the vicinity of the bank, 
        and in East Freeport. 
      <p><b>People</b> 
      <p>The people in Freeport are as varied as the town itself. Travelling through 
        the city one can see an entire range of races, including ogres and dark 
        elves, humans and elves, and various beggars in between. Also, it is not 
        uncommon to see several of the more powerful members of their guilds travelling 
        through Freeport on their ways to other places, or engaged in some transaction. 
      <p>The guards of Freeport constantly roam the corridors, and to the naked 
        eye could be considered normal guards. Beneath the surface, however, the 
        paladins of Mithaniel Marr secretly hunt the guards, for they are corrupt, 
        and, as rumors have it, their leader was a banished paladin himself.
