      <h3> <font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      Upper Guk is the upper level of one of the largest dungeons to be found 
      in the entire realm of Norrath, and home to one of the most advanced societies, 
      on par with the Kerrans. It is a vast and twisting place, filled with the 
      frogloks and laden with their unique treasures. 
      <h3> <font size=+2>D</font>angers</h3>
      Upper Guk is an extremely dangerous place to adventure in. This is due to 
      a variety of factors, starting with the distribution of creatures throughout 
      the zone. I mapped most of this zone as an 11th level Wood Elf Ranger, who 
      had never killed a froglok in his life, and not one froglok attacked me. 
      This is a good thing, because once I was two rooms out from the main water 
      room with the bridge, every froglok was tombstone to me. The depths are 
      filled with even more dangerous frogloks, and there is close proximity of 
      low and high level frogloks throughout the zone. One has to be careful who 
      they pick a fight with, because around the corner could lie a froglok warrior 
      five levels higher. In conjunction with this, the frogloks work together 
      well. In the very first room are usually two froglok tads, approximately 
      fourth level. In the next room are often at least one froglok guard, who 
      is approximately eighth level. If you attempt to fight this froglok and 
      draw him into the first room, the tads will begin to heal him and your fight 
      becomes a nightmare. Attempting to kill off the tads first is likewise dangerous, 
      as they will flee and then you'll have the guard at your back while you 
      try to finish off the tad. In other words, although the creatures start 
      at about 4th level, most of the people adventuring in the front rooms are 
      at least level 10. 
      <p>Probably as a result of the above, this place has some very dangerous 
        trains. These are not Blackburrow trains where there is one Elite Guard 
        mixed in with some Burly Gnolls, these are trains of 20th level and higher 
        warriors mixed with tads. These trains are even more dangerous because 
        of the ingeniously evil layout of the entrance of Guk. The entry hallway 
        is large enough to fit one ogre/troll, but no others can fit by. One AFK 
        ogre in the doorway equals your death. Also, the entry hall with the bridge 
        over the water is also very tricky to navigate, and will definitely slow 
        you down if you want to keep from falling into the water. 
      <p>I could go into much more about why this place is dangerous, but suffice 
        it to say that when I usually enter the zone, there are usually 15th to 
        20th level characters resting in the entry hallway, and they usually fight 
        in one or two rooms past the water room, drawing out frogloks from the 
        rooms beyond. If this sounds like your kind of place, then go on in. Also, 
        there is the difficulty of death and having to run from Freeport to Guk 
        naked... 
      <p>Also of note, most of the good races (I haven't checked them all) can 
        actually enter Guk and travel unhindered throughout it. This assumes, 
        of course, that you have never in your entire life killed a froglok. If 
        you have killed a froglok, you will notice that you can still travel throughout 
        the dungeon unhindered, although this comes with a caveat. My example 
        is my wood elf, passing through the temple where he had previously traveled 
        unmolested, was attacked by every froglok present after a Tuk Warrior 
        took offense at my presence, and this after killing one froglok forager 
        in the swamp above. He actually would have outrun the train (probably 
        one of the more ugly in Guk history) but instead got caught in a blind 
        end water filled area where the crocs lair above. Be careful what you 
        hunt... 
      <p>More specific dangers involve some of the unique spawns/camp spots. Three 
        of the rooms, in particular, are very dangerous. The rooms with the Summoner, 
        the Scryer, and the Shin Lord, all have relatively the same danger, and 
        that is that they are tough rooms to crack and keep open. Basically, if 
        you could hunt these critters for experience, these rooms are a danger. 
        The problem is that attacking one creature in the room brings at least 
        half a dozen very powerful frogloks on top of you. Controlling these fights 
        requires a balanced and controlled group, a lot of Snaring, and some luck. 
        Once the room is clean, however, you can't rest. Constant fighting ensues 
        in order to keep the room clean, and you have to make sure the surrounding 
        area is kept clear or you'll have some very lethal spawns.
      <h3> <font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>
      Despite the above mentioned dangerousness of the zone, this has to be one 
      of the most popular dungeons in the game, the only problem with this is 
      that it is so far away from the majority of players, and the difficulty 
      at getting bound nearby for any of the good races. There are several reasons 
      for this, but the largest is that the frogloks are just plain rich. Even 
      the lowliest froglok possesses woven armor, which is about the equivalent 
      of banded armor for mage classes. It sells for about the same as well, and 
      monks will pay a great deal of money for the woven gloves, which count as 
      magical weapons for them. 
      <p>There is also a large amount of good equipment to be had in Upper Guk. 
        Many of the items are on characters wish lists, and the added benefit 
        of making some great experience while waiting for the critter who carries 
        it to spawn is worthwhile.
      <h3> <font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
        <font size=+2>U</font>pper <font size=+2>G</font>uk</h3>
      There is one entrance into Upper Guk from the Innothule Swamp. The entrance 
      is guarded on the outside by two froglok guards, and on the inside has a 
      narrow corridor guarded by at least one higher level froglok guard. 
      <p>The entrances to Lower Guk are apparently many in number, but I have 
        never personally found any of them, despite traveling far into the zone.
