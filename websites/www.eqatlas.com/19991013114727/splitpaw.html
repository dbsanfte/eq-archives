<h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>

<p>Splitpaw is the home of the Splitpaw clan of gnolls. Splitpaw is the site where 
  in gnoll legend, their god set his foot upon the earth, and the surface markings 
  are his footprint. Nobody knows if this is true, but hunters in Southern Karana 
  know the three talons rising from the ground that mark the entrance to the lair.
<h3><font size=+2>D</font>angers </h3>

<p>This is a dungeon for middle level characters, and the difficulty of the dungeon 
  scales relatively slowly from the entrance to the deeper parts of the dungeon. 
  The front entrance is occupied by 6th level gnolls, and their level increases 
  as you get further in, so that by the time you reach the back of the first level, 
  they are about 9th-10th level.
<p>The main danger in this dungeon, as in Blackburrow, is training. The trains 
  here are not huge Blackburrow trains, but little mini-trains where the local 
  gnolls decide to help out their buddies. Starting at the entrance, almost all 
  of the gnolls are with a partner at least, and so you have to be able to take 
  on two 6th level gnolls if you even want to walk in the front door (which is 
  why the level is listed starting at 8 above). Gnolls, like all the half-sentient 
  evil humanoids, have a tendency to flee. Since they have a fair number of hit 
  points and are really chickens, they can make it quite far while fleeing, which 
  makes it so that you have more gnolls joining in than you care to have. If you 
  are from a class who can snare or root, or are in a group and have some leeway, 
  then you can start hunting at low-level. Otherwise, I'd avoid it until you hit 
  about 9th or 10th level.
<p>There is also a problem because in certain areas you will be attacking gnolls 
  thinking there is nobody nearby, and some gnoll will come running around the 
  corner. This is a &quot;feature&quot; of EQ where creatures can tell you are 
  attacking their buddy despite walls being between you and them. This is of special 
  importance at the small room on the other side of the first bridge. There are 
  usually a few gnolls here, and are relatively easy to take (if you've made it 
  this far, you can take them). The danger is that around the corner and through 
  a gate lies a Splitpaw Guard, who will come running if he is close enough, and 
  is a level or two higher then these gnolls. Basically, if you hear the chains 
  rattling, turn and run.
<p>Also be aware that there are some high level shamans in the lower levels, as 
  well as a high level necromancer at the back of the upper level. These dudes 
  are evil, especially the necro, cuz you don't know he's around (unless you can 
  track) until you open the door to the room he's in and his pets come after you. 
  Not fun...
<p>There aren't really any other unique dangers to Splitpaw. If you know group 
  monster management and how not to train, then you can get by well. The only 
  other problem with the zone is that it's a long walk from Qeynos or Highhold 
  Pass. If you can get bound in Arena, that would help.
<h3><font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>

<p>Splitpaw is, by far, one of my favorite zones to hunt in. How many times have 
  I been in there and found more than ten other people hunting in there? None. 
  This makes the zone a dream come true. It is one of the least hunted zones in 
  the game, probably because it's far away from merchants and towns. If you can 
  handle the walk, however, this zone is for you.
<p>The gnolls are pretty easy to handle, given that you are careful.At higher 
  levels (like 11th or so) you have your run of almost the entire upper level, 
  which is nice. You can choose who to fight and when, and go sit amongst the 
  lower level gnolls to rest and meditate. This has also got some great Giant 
  Snake Fang hunting, as the snakes spawn fairly regularly and are easy to get 
  to.
<p>The above ground area of Splitpaw is also a nice area to hunt at a lower level. 
  The gnolls are fairly spread out and walk around (but not too much). This is 
  a little bit easier for you if you can't make it past the first room of Splitpaw 
  because of the gnoll grouping.
<p>Not much else to say about this zone. It's nice, uncontested, simple hunting. 
  My only wish is a closer merchant cuz you will get so bogged down with goods 
  that you wind up throwing out rusty weapons like crazy. I found a bug where 
  your money wraps back to zero once you hit 500 of them by hunting in this zone. 
  Sad...
<h3><font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
  <font size=+2>S</font>plitpaw</h3>

<p>There is only one way to get to Splitpaw, and that is by entering Southern 
  Plains of Karana and travelling to the center. When you see the three bloody 
  claws sticking up from the earth, pass in between them. In what would be the 
  center of the paw, there is a small dark hole facing the claws that is the entrance 
  to Splitpaw. This is easy to miss if you've never seen in before (and the first 
  time I mapped Southern Karana in the beta, I walked over this and never saw 
  it), so keep your eyes peeled, it's there somewhere.
