<h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
<p>Rivervale is a quiet town, hidden well in the valley surrounding a small lake 
  that is the head of a river running through Antonica. The layout of the town 
  is simple, with tunnels burrowed through rock as its entrances and the river 
  running out through a narrow, unpassable gorge. Rivervale itself is separated 
  into the town itself where most people live, the docks, and the farms, where 
  the druids work and the clergy pray.
<h3><font size=+2>S</font>urrounding <font size=+2>A</font>reas</h3>
<p>The Misty Thicket has several huts of more intrepid salespeople trying to reach 
  the crowd of people that pass through this area between Freeport and Qeynos. 
  The area is also rampant with insects, as well as tougher creatures past the 
  wall.
<p>Kithicor Forest itself is much closer to the usual route between the two coasts, 
  and sees more of the urban travellers. It is also much more dangerous. I haven't 
  spent much time there, just passing through on the beat of my drum...
<h3><font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
  <font size=+2>R</font>ivervale</h3>
<p>Rivervale can be accessed from one side through the Kithicor Forest through 
  a narrow, well-hidden tunnel. The other side opens onto the Misty Thicket, where 
  many halflings make their homes. This area is generally a little safer for the 
  traveller, but further afield lies areas best avoided.
<h3><font size=+2>L</font>ocal <font size=+2>C</font>olor</h3>
<p><b>Places</b>
<p>The town is very quaint, with holes where the halfings live and do business, 
  as well as larger businesses that seem built to house more of the taller folk, 
  like the local bar. Also, one of the largest and most well-kept inns lies in 
  this green glade, with a warm hearth for everyone who passes its mantle.
<p><b>People</b>
<p>The people in Rivervale are very easy to get along with. Most of them like 
  to talk, and will speak with anyone who walks by. Of course, if you are evil 
  or working for the forces of same, don't expect a friendly reception by the 
  town guard.
