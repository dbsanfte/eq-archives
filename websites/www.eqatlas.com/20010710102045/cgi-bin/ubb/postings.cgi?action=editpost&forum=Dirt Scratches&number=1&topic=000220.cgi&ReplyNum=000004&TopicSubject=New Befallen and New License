<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">     This might be a long one, so bear with me...  I finally got a petition reply last night to my account being bugged insofar as I am unable to use keys in the game.  After the expected response of "you're just not doing it right," I managed to convince the Guide that I might not be as stupid as the /petition sounded.  I'm sure that being lvl 30 had something to do with getting an answer, because at level 5 when the problem started, it was just not possible to get an answer from anyone.  The Guide conned dubious, but agreed to see the problem first hand.  
     Since Befallen was the closest zone around, I decided to wack the shadow knight, get a key, prove I wasn't a moron, and see what happened next.  The first thing I noticed when I got there was the front end of the place was packed.  It seemed weird since it's not exactly a big dungeon for trains, but I figured since I had never really played there, what did I know, and moved along.  Right when I walked into the first door, the hyper aggro started.  I had to wack about 12 mobs just to get to the bedroom where the guy spawned.  
     I figured out the patch made some big changes right away, but since everything died easy, no big deal.  They kept jumping me, and I kept killing them for 45 minutes waiting for the spawn.  I tried invis to med (I'm an SK) but since there is a mix of living and undead monsters there, that was a bit difficult, but not impossible.  When they got me to 2 bubs of health after killing 60 or more of them, I feigned death by the spawn point and waited.  And waited.  And waited.  When I got my key, now from a named Dark Elf Shadow Knight, I beat my way out, and got the guide there.  After 10 minutes of "wow, that's a weird problem" while being aggroed multiple times w/o the guide doing anything besides waiting for me to kill the next five things that jumped me before asking me to it try again, I left at 1 bub of health, and was rewarded with an e-mail address for my trouble.  I guess the new AI in there should be dubbed "Artificial Insanity" being that every mob was conning green to the level 18 pally who was ahead of me in line for the key.  Is the logic of the mob now that if I can't med or heal, perhaps his 300th friend will kill me before I can zone?  On the way out, I found a new DE camp along the opposite zone wall with named mobs who conned even to blue to me, and seemed to have some connection to the new quests/monster set in Befallen.
     I am bringing in my usual group tonight and we are going to hose the place top to bottom, if some 30's group isn't doing it already, and take a look-see at the changes and drops.  There were new no drops on the mobs I killed, a Sr. Apprentice robe was common off a few of them, and a cast iron mace dropped that weighed something like 20,000 stones.  I had never seen the mace or the no drops before.  I'll post here if I find out anything interesting.
     As for a new license agreement; I'm one of those happy go lucky sorts who doesn't look at them.  "My first born?  Sounds fine to me..." &lt;accept&gt;  I'd be interested in what changed on it if someone wants to outline it.  If I read it now, I wouldn't know the difference.  So to summerize; suicidal mobs, Named and vanilla new DE mobs, mini ghouls, new drops, green to 18 on the first floor.  If you go in there pre 20, bring a cleric, because if you don't, you'll be needing one to get back to your body anyway.
