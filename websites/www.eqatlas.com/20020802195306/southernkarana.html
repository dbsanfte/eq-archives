      <h3> <font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      The Southern Plains of Karana mark the southernmost expanse of the vast 
      Plains of Karana, and lie just north of the Rathe mountain range and the 
      swamplands beyond. They are generally quieter than the other areas of the 
      plains, there are no hill giants or griffons around. Wolves, lions, and 
      elephants roam the plains here, with the occasional centaur hunter in chase. 
      <h3> <font size=+2>D</font>angers</h3>
      This zone is very dangerous only if you are the type of person who likes 
      to make enemies. By that, I mean that if you have been hunting creatures 
      (lions, wolves, elephants) that generally leave you alone, this zone will 
      be very deadly for you, as they all are roaming throughout the area. On 
      the other hand, if you have no quarrel with these creatures, you can roam 
      freely without fear of random attacks. 
      <p>The only other real danger in this zone, aside from the above, is the 
        roaming elephant named Cracktusk. This elephant has been driven into a 
        homicidal rage by the crack in his tusk that causes him exquisite pain. 
        Be very careful of this creature, for although he is not in the zone often, 
        if he is he can sense you from farther away than you can see him, and 
        he runs far faster than any character can without the aid of magic (and 
        so fast, in fact, I wonder if magic would help). My ranger was tracking 
        him from a distance, and my first view of him was with him charging me. 
      <p>The other NPC that can be dangerous is Lord Grimrot himself. He is the 
        bane of the Qeynos area, and there are many quests surrounding this character. 
        He spawns at the northernmost undead ruins, just south of the bridge, 
        and appears either as a human dressed in plate carrying a large scythe 
        or as a skeleton (which I personally have never seen). He is so tough 
        that I know 50th level paladins who could not solo him, but I know small 
        groups in their mid-30's who have taken him successfully, and he doesn't 
        roam from this area unless drawn out. 
      <p>A downside, more than a danger, is that most of the good spawn spots 
        are usually taken around the clock. These include any area near the aviak 
        town, the treants, the spires around Splitpaw, etc. Unless you can spend 
        some time solo'ing, I wouldn't make a super long trip to here unless you 
        know you can get into a group, as you might be standing around for a bit.
      <h3> <font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>
      The largest benefit of this area is that it is one of the busiest (in terms 
      of creatures) areas to adventure in. A person could solo or group here from 
      the low-teens up to the early 30's in level and never leave. The large spaces 
      allow us druids our room to kite in, and groups can also pull from the various 
      known spawn spots. 
      <p>The other plus to this area is that it is a very unique area of the world 
        to hunt in and explore. There is no other zone with elephants, no other 
        zone with Centaurs, no other zone with an entire aviak town. Quillmane 
        is a pegasus that occasionally flies across the northern edge or middle 
        of the zone, and can be taken on by high level groups. There are also 
        cropping up many unique named NPC's here, including a wolf, lion, and 
        cyclops. There are several undead camps that provide a large amount of 
        experience for large groups that wish to take them out. Lord Grimrot hides 
        out here, as well as a hermit. And on top of it all, the rough rock spires 
        of Splitpaw rise from the center of the zone... 
      <h3> <font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
        <font size=+2>S</font>outhern <font size=+2>P</font>lains of <font size=+2>K</font>arana</h3>
      On the northern edge of the zone the surrounding hills fade away to mark 
      a pass that leads down to the bridge to the Northern Plains of Karana. The 
      Guards of Qeynos, including their Commander, guard this bridge from their 
      tower on the northern edge of the bridge. 
      <p>On the southern edge of the zone lies a narrow pass that leads into the 
        depths of the Rathe Mountains, including Lake Rathe and from there the 
        mountains themselves, and to the swamps beyond, the homes of the ogres 
        and trolls. This is the pass one must go through on the southern route 
        from Qeynos to Freeport. 
      <p>In the middle of the zone, directly between the passes to the north and 
        south, lies the entrance to the Lair of Splitpaw. Several stone spires 
        marking the claws rise from the earth, and the small tunnel to the lair 
        below lies between them.
