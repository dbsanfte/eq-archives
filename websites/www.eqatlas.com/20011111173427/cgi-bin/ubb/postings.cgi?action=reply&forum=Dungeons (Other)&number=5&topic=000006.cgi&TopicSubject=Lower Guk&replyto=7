[B]I have been living in Lower Guk since about level 35. These guys are right, a Paladin basically rules in Lower Guk on the dead side. With our Undead based spells and our Ghoulbane, we can hold our own quite nicely.

I first did the bedroom, then I moved on to Assassin. On my servers Exe, Sage and all those guys are in one camp we call the DT (Death Tower.) Since I hit 40 I am getting in Frenzied now. After that, I plan to hit Lord. Gotta get my FBSS first.

Once higher you can then safely move on to the Frenzied Ghoul, the Arch Magi and finally the Ghoul Lord.<P>Evacer's are useful as a situation can always get out of hand, but a well balanced group who doesn't pull out of their depth will be able to fight indefinately, and the travel to the zone is simple once you know your way.<P>Guk is a very worthwhile, exciting dungeon.<P>Good Luck<P>Tytho Greycloak<BR>42nd Rogue Adventurer<BR>Ronin<BR>Tunare Server<P>P.S.

I have hunted three times in Assasin and got killed in two of those attempts. Get into a group that knows what they are doing. Even if you do EXPECT to die from time to time. LIVE with it, LGuk is WORTH it!<BR>It was hard to get into groups when I was lower than 34. Now it is easier. I only leave the dungeon when I die. My little enchanter buys supplies in FP, runs to UGuk, picks up my backback of FS and GP,SP,CP then gates back. Rinse and repeat.

I started there at 35, did okay, but wasn't comfortable there until about 40.  I made the other 5 levels elsewhere.  I hunt there on occasion, but not as my everyday spot.<P>As a pally, you'll be GREAT there.  Invis undead is an absolute must here, and if you have a GB, YOO DA MAN!  <P>Evac'rs are always a good idea when you're this deep.  In fact, I make it a point to ALWAYS travel with an evac'r.  Oh, waitaminit, I'm a druid...  Seriously, this place can get nasty from time to time, even for a great group.  Bad luck happens.  I've evac'd groups out of here 3 times.  Was successful twice.  (Toldja things get hairy.)<P>Oh yeah, Taobob, my little brother got his Guise at level 7.  There's a guide on how to do it, I think it's at the Safehouse site.  It's not that hard, especially as a rogue.<P>Oak<P>PS- It's all about Dead side.  Oh yeah, I found out the Froglok Assassin can see through Invis Undead, first hand.   <IMG SRC="http://www.eqatlas.com/ubb/frown.gif"> <p>[This message has been edited by Oakshot (edited 09-09-2000).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">taobob</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Any idea if the Assassin can see through Hide/Sneak??

A level 51 Necro nearly bit it trying to get it out for me.  We eventually got lucky because someone trained the room (and everything along the way) back to the zone.

I was Hiding Sneaking in the underground of Freeport and a Dark Elf at one of the guilds there not only saw through the Hide/sneak but also through doors and walls. I had to have a GM help me get that particular corpse (funny how they didn;t consider it a bug that she could see through walls).... The evil eye charmed me after his pet hit me causing the hide to come off... And the Skeleton Squad leader happened to kill me when he dropped outta thin air on top of me when night fell in Kithicor...<P>Ultravision does allow you to see invisible creatures....

There are usually people here to defend you from trains, etc.  Find the group (there usually is one) that's camping the ass/sup room and give em a tell.

Being in the middle of Lower Guk without IU is very bad  <IMG SRC="http://www.eqatlas.com/ubb/smile.gif">.
