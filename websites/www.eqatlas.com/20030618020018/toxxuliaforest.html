      <h3> <font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      Toxxulia Forest is a dark, quiet forest that encompasses much of the island 
      continent of Odus. It is separated into two areas by a river running roughly 
      east to west through it, the northern half more habited and the southern 
      half controlled by the kobolds and the necromancers. 
      <h3> <font size=+2>D</font>angers</h3>
      <p>This island is the newbie area for the Erudites, and much of the northern 
        half of the zone consists of creatures second level or less running around. 
        The southern half is a little more dangerous, with the most dangerous 
        being the fact that it's easy to get lost here and aggressive skeletons 
        and kobolds roam the zone. It is considered unwise to venture below the 
        bridge unless you are at least 4th level or higher. </p>
      <p>There is one NPC that is a major pain, named Rungupp. He is on my short 
        list for NPC's that I plan on travelling across several continents specifically 
        to kill again, and is one of the most unbalanced NPC's around. Basically, 
        my 11th level ranger hunted him down to try and take him out, and he /con'ed 
        green to me. My first attempt I had to run for my life, and luckily could 
        outrun him handily to Erudin. I learned two things from this, however, 
        and that's that Rungupp will cross the bridge, and also that the guards 
        of Erudin apparently like Rungupp and do not attack him. My second attempt 
        involved joining some friends to take him out at the gate, since they 
        felt that his ability to blind me continually (and never run out of mana) 
        might be hurting my chances. So our larger group of my ranger, a cleric, 
        and a wizard, all of whom /con'ed him as green tried to take him. Basically 
        what happened was we ran into a complete standoff, where none of us were 
        able to take him down (he heals as fast as he damages you), and then when 
        we were close he fled, apparently regenerating at a phenomenal rate, and 
        eventually just popped out of the zone (my theory is that he gated home 
        to Innothule). In other words, Rungupp is a major pain, and a group of 
        11th level characters couldn't take him. 
      <h3> <font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>
      This is generally a pretty quiet and safe zone. There are not so many creatures 
      in the newbie area that you can get killed easily by wandering monsters. 
      On the other side of the bridge, although there are dangers, it is generally 
      pretty safe. The water acts as sort of a barrier for monsters in the zone, 
      in that the tougher monsters generally appear south of the water, but this 
      isn't always the case, and it's important to stay on your toes north of 
      the bridge. 
      <p>The other benefit is the kobolds in the camps. They are generally pretty 
        safe to camp out and there are rarely anyone else by them. A mage with 
        a 4th level pet could take one on if they were careful, or a two person 
        group, and they provide good mid-range exp. The only thing is that you 
        have to watch for wandering skeletons that will attack you and make you 
        run for the bridge. 
      <h3> <font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
        <font size=+2>T</font>oxxulia <font size=+2>F</font>orest</h3>
      At the northern edge of the zone lies the entrance to the city of Erudin, 
      home of the followers of Erud. Passing underneath the "patio" will take 
      you to the city beyond. Within lies the docks from which you can reach the 
      ferry to Erud's Crossing and Qeynos. 
      <p>Swimming west across the water, straight out from the dock on the west 
        coast, will take you to the shores of Kerra Island, which is the home 
        of the Kerrans. The channel is only guarded by the occasional pirhana. 
      <p>To the south lies another "patio" that leads to the Heretic city of Paineel....
