      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      <p>Runnyeye Citadel is the underground home of the Runnyeye clan of Goblins. 
        Their tunnels wind their way through the hills, carving deeper and deeper 
        down into the depths. There are rumors that the Runnyeye clan of gnolls 
        are allied in some strange way with the evil eyes ruled by King Xorbb, 
        working together to expand both of their domains. They also seemed to 
        have tapped into other elemental beings that make their home in this area 
        of Norrath. 
      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>angers </h3>
      <p>This dungeon is one of the most confusing and twisted of all the dungeons. 
        Travelling through it requires a good sense of direction, because the 
        tunnel weaves and splits at many points throughout its journey. The upper 
        level is fairly straightforward, and inhabited by the lower level goblins 
        of the Citadel, including the occasional goblin worker, and are relatively 
        safe for the lower level adventurer. 
      <p>Lower down the dungeon becomes even more confusing, as many rooms have 
        multiple intersections with other rooms in the area, making it hard to 
        find your way to a point or away from a particularly nasty critter. Few 
        people travel deep into this dungeon without a strong group backing them 
        up. 
      <p>The inhabitants of the lower levels also make the area difficult to adventure 
        in. Goblins must spend a great deal of their time training spellcasters 
        among their ranks, since more than half of the monsters that you will 
        encounter deep down are some sort of shaman, with the occasional wizard 
        thrown in. Add this to the fact that they are only rarely found by themselves, 
        more commonly in groups of 3 or 4, make this area that much more dangerous, 
        and practically mandate hunting with a group. 
      <p>The most dangerous feature of the dungeon is, however, the evil eyes. 
        They are regularly found in the lower levels in various rooms, and can 
        be heard because they make a sick, sticky sound as their eye opens and 
        closes. They are much higher level than the local goblins, as well, so 
        you must keep your eyes peeled when hunting goblins that one of these 
        doesn't appear, because it's a long way to the top. Probably the most 
        dangerous behavior these creatures exhibit, however, is that they will 
        occasionally wander all the way to the top. I believe this happens when 
        they are trained up there from below, but they might well do this on their 
        own. For the lower level characters at the top of the dungeon, they are 
        very lethal. With only one spell, one of them killed my fully healed 10th 
        level ranger as he fled to the exit. If you ever see &quot;Evil eye begins 
        to cast a spell.&quot; in your chat window, my advice is to zone and zone 
        fast. 
      <h3><font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>
      <p>This zone is blessed with an abundance of goblins, which are separated 
        quite well by level between the various levels. The lower level goblins 
        (7th and 8th) live on the upper level and stay there, wandering back and 
        forth, and are usually not in groups so can be solo'ed well. The higher 
        level goblins are in the second level, and usually come in groups. This 
        means that they must be hunted in groups, but are separated into their 
        own rooms and so the pulls are fairly predictable. I've never seen a train 
        in Runnyeye like you would see in Blackburrow or some of the other places. 
      <p>There are also some neat items that can be found in this dungeon. The 
        throne room area has monsters that possess Blackened Iron Armor, which 
        adds to strength and looks very cool. Also, the evil eyes are a big draw 
        to this area, and the evil eye that spawns the lens for the Staff of the 
        Observer lives in this zone. 
      <p>Also, there is a bank in Runnyeye. Yes, a bank. You can go there, change 
        in coppers, and go hunting some more, although you have to be at least 
        level 30 so they are non-aggressive to you. Very cool... 
      <h3><font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
        <font size=+2>R</font>unnyeye <font size=+2>C</font>itadel</h3>
      <p>There are two entrances to Runneye, both of which are fairly close to 
        one another. The first entrance from Misty Thicket includes a long, relatively 
        safe, tunnel into the zone. Only very rarely do goblins venture down this 
        path. 
      <p>Keeping directly to the right will take you quickly to the entrance to 
        the Gorge of King Xorbb, which is readily identifiable by the stakes with 
        the human heads and the large &quot;Keep Out&quot; written in blood on 
        the wall opposite the entrance. This is a very quick escape from trains 
        who may happen to be following you from the second level...
