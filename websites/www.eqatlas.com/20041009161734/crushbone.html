      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      <p>Crushbone is the home of the Crushbone clan of orcs. It is located directly 
        to the north of the wood elf city of Kelethin, and is the major thorn 
        in the sides of all the inhabitants of the island of Faydwer. The city 
        is accessible from only one entrance, and is set up in the shape of a 
        ring. To the west side of Crushbone lies a small building where elves 
        and dwarves actually live, as well as the entrance to the slave pits. 
        The the northeast lies the home of Emporer Crush, and is a dangerous place 
        to hang out in as his troopers continuously move about. In the center 
        is a large hill where the orc trainer trains his troops. A river flows 
        around and through the area. 
      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>angers </h3>
      <p>This level is extremely dangerous, despite the fact that there are orc 
        pawns here, I would not recommend it for anyone under 4th level, and even 
        that is pushing it. It is dangerous for several reasons. The first reason 
        it is dangerous occurs when there are very few people around, the other 
        when there are too many people around. 
      <p>The first danger occurs when there are few people around, and this is 
        that the orcs reclaim their area, slowly spreading out from the back areas 
        to the front by spawning in gradually further forwards areas. Once all 
        of the forward spawn sites are full, the patrols begin. These patrols 
        usually consist of a pair of fairly tough orc centurions who run from 
        one side, out to the entrance, and then back in and over to the other 
        side. There are usually two opposing troops that move in this way. After 
        them come the Legionnaire patrol, which consists of the Legionnaire and 
        two very high level orc centurions (around 9th or 10th) who walk the same 
        route. The only way I saw all of this is by hiding next to a tree and 
        watching them all go by, and it made me sweat. 
      <p>The second problem occurs when there are too many people in the zone 
        (which is most of the time now). This generates a rapid spawn rate because 
        there is a rapid kill rate, and trains result. Now, trains around here 
        aren't the type of trains that occur in Blackburrow, for instance, which 
        consist of a dozen gnolls running around. The trains here consist of the 
        orcs that people tend to flee from, namely the Legionnaire and his centurions, 
        who are high level, or Emperor Crush himself and an oracle or two. Now, 
        these aren't huge trains, but they are very deadly as these troops are 
        very powerful and can take out a large number of midlevel troops before 
        being taken out themselves. The other problem with this is that they tend 
        to attack indiscriminately, so simply standing too closely could mean 
        that you get whacked, and people tend to not warn you that they are coming 
        with hell on their heels, so you can get caught unaware. Again, keep your 
        eyes peeled. 
      <h3><font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>
      <p>Despite the great danger in this area, there are many good reasons to 
        hunt here. The first is the wealth that you can gather in a short time 
        here. As a 7th level by myself, I gathered 2 platinum in the time it took 
        me to go up less than one bubble. Most of the orcs here have some form 
        of cloth armor or weapon on them, all of which is worth money. Some of 
        the best weapons on the weaker orcs are Cracked Staffs, which you can 
        sell for over 1 platinum to a friendly merchant. There's no better feeling 
        than going home encumbered because you've got 3 or 4 of these in your 
        backpack. 
      <p>Probably the biggest reason people hunt here is for the treasure trove 
        in unique items and quest items that can be found here. Some nice low-level 
        items come out of this dungeon exclusively. First of all, there is the 
        Shiny Brass Shield, a shield that sometimes appears on the Orc Trainer. 
        This is a nice shield that is relatively cheap to buy now, and should 
        be resting on everyone's arm if they can't use two weapons. Also, the 
        Legionnaire's have shoulderpads and bracers that are regularly on the 
        market for sale, as well as items that can be used to get one of the quest 
        items, the Screaming Mace. Some of the other items that have become staples 
        of this game are the Dwarven Ringmail Tunic, dropped by the Emperor himself, 
        and the Dragoon Dirk, a highly sought after low- to mid-level piercing 
        weapon, that drops off of our favorite newbie killer himself, D'vinn. 
      <p>I personally greatly enjoyed hunting in Crushbone. The monsters came 
        in more manageable numbers and the number of other hunters wasn't as annoying 
        as it was just outside the gates. Also, they spawned closer together, 
        so there wasn't as much of a problem with roaming (by you) or camping 
        (by others). You can watch several spawn spots by yourself and make a 
        good profit and good exp quite quickly. 
      <h3><font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
        <font size=+2>C</font>rushbone</h3>
      <p>There is only one entrance to Crushbone, directly north from the city 
        of Kelethin. You can get to it by heading north from the northernmost 
        lift in Kelethin (it's the one furthest away from the other two) or by 
        following the path straight out. The entrance is ringed by two pyres, 
        so it's hard to miss. From Felwithe you can either follow the trail to 
        Kelethin and go north from there, or turn right directly out from the 
        main entrance and follow the border of the zone all the way to Crushbone. 
        Although the second method is more boring, it's also quicker and almost 
        impossible to get lost doing.
