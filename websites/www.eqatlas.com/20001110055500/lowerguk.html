      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      <p>The Ruins of Ancient Guk is a vast array of tunnels that connect between 
        the ruins themselves and the upper tunnelways that eventually lead to 
        the Innothule Swamp. It is also the battleground between the living frogloks, 
        led by the Froglok King, and the undead who have taken over most of the 
        deepest ruins, led by their Ghoul Lord.
      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>angers </h3>
      <p>This dungeon is generally regarded as one of the two most deadly dungeons 
        on the continent of Antonica. It is divided up into two general areas, 
        the &quot;Live&quot; side and the &quot;Dead&quot; side, named for the 
        life/unlife status of the majority of the frogloks within. There are general 
        dangers for the dungeon, as well as for each side, that I will mention 
        before going into specific dangers.
      <p>Lower Guk has as its main defense the confusing nature of how it is set 
        up, as well as lack of ready access to the deeper areas of the dungeon. 
        It is quite easy to get lost if you don't know where you're going in these 
        tunnels, and this is especially noticeable in the maze area on Live side. 
        Also, getting to a particular point in the dungeon from which to pull 
        is not an easy task for most, because they are deep in and past many aggressive 
        creatures. The use of invisibility is helpful, but only with large cautions 
        to it. First of all, the distinction between Live and Dead side is not 
        absolute. On Dead side there are many &quot;live&quot; creatures that 
        can readily see through Invis v Undead, most noticably the vampire bats. 
        On Live side, it is possible to encounter undead creatures because of 
        infrequent trains to the exit, although this is much less likely. Also, 
        there are occasionally creatures that can see through invisibility as 
        you travel through, so be careful as you go. Now onto each individual 
        side. 
      <p>Live side is a typical dungeon that you are likely used to, in the vein 
        of the Solusek dungeons. The only specific danger to this side is that 
        hunting here can seriously hurt your froglok faction, which for many is 
        important in order to safely travel Upper Guk as well as most of Live 
        side. If you are unfortunate enough to lose faction when you didn't want 
        to, killing undead frogloks will increase your faction with the living 
        ones. Dead side's only real danger is the number of undead monsters. This 
        is a big bonus for those classes with special skills in this area, but 
        for the others brings with it the fun that fighting the undead always 
        brings. Most of Dead side is also very far away from any exits, so you 
        had better have an evacuator in case of trouble.
      <p>There are few specific dangers to note in Lower Guk. The few that exist 
        are that there are quite a number of shaman and wizard frogloks in this 
        dungeon, which can be very problematic because of the DoT and DD spells. 
        Most groups tend to remove them from battle sooner rather than later. 
        The Huge Water Elemental is important to note on Live side, because even 
        if frogloks are your friends, he will attack you and the nearby frogloks 
        will assist him. He can see through invisibility.
      <h3><font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>
      <p>There must be something that keeps bringing people to Lower Guk, because 
        it traditionally has been one of the most packed dungeons around, and 
        you were able, in the past, to walk nearly freely as the frogloks were 
        dead within seconds of appearing in their homes. Things have gotten a 
        little bit less crowded in there, but the draw is the same: experience 
        and loot for high-level characters.
      <p>The items in this zone are probably the most sought after items in the 
        game for this level range. Skimming through the listing reveals mainstays 
        of high-priced auctions, like Short Sword of Ykesha, FBSS, Runed Falchions, 
        to name a few. Most people come here to hunt with the dream of ancient 
        froglok treasures to carry them into the swamps.
      <p>This is also a great area for experience for higher level characters. 
        It is also something of a training ground for fighting in the higher level 
        dungeons on Kunark, as the skills that you develop here for advanced grouping 
        are absolutely essential when you move to the even more dangerous dungeons 
        of that once-lost continent.
      <h3><font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
        <font size=+2>L</font>ower <font size=+2>G</font>uk</h3>
      <p>There are several entrances to Lower Guk from Upper Guk. Specifically, 
        there are three entrances that come out in relative proximity in Dead 
        side from Upper Guk. Two of these require a short swim through the rivers, 
        and the dry one is closest to the front entrance of Guk. The one entrance 
        to Live side is the deepest into Upper Guk, and isn't as commonly used.
      <p>Other than using the entrances from Upper Guk to leave, there is one 
        additional exit. From the King's Room on Live side there is a zone exit 
        in the back that will take you to Upper Guk right beside the entrance 
        to the swamp. It isn't an exit for casual use, as it leads you directly 
        past the toughest monster in Lower Guk, but it's there if you need it.
