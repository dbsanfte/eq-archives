[B]All good advice above.  If it might help, check out the Newbie Guide at  [URL=http://www.eqatlas.com/newbieguide.html]http://www.eqatlas.com/newbieguide.html[/URL] .

Just to emphasize a few points.  Being a newbie now isn't what it used to be.  There are so many people out there who are twinked, that when I see a newbie who is actually naked, he usually winds up with some item that I had in my backpack taking up space.  Many people do the same.  However, that will *not* happen if the newbie runs up and asks some variation of "do you have any stuff for me?"  As a lvl 30 druid, there are a hundred other similarly irritating questions ("sow plz"), but that's up there.

Don't worry too much about money.  Levelling is more lucrative, because if you are more powerful, you can kill monsters that give off more money.  The two extremes are the newbie who runs back to sell everything that they loot all the time.  This isn't bad in places like Kelethin or Butcherblock, where there are merchants in the same zone, but if you have to go one or two zones in to do it, it sucks up a lot of time.  As a newbie, 15 wasted minutes is a bubble of exp.  When I'm doing the newbie thing, I simply loot things that are stackable or worth quite a bit (rusty weapons) and only go sell when I'm full of that (usually encumbered).  You'll level faster because of it, trust me.

I have tried a few different class/race combinations and am now playing a druid/woodelf.....A few things I've noticed playing this game...<BR>starting characters (ie: lvl 1-5) have one helluva time trying to get gear...what is the deal with these same low level characters being able to get quests that they have no means of completing a <IMG SRC="http://www.eqatlas.com/ubb/smile.gif"> because you have to cross into high level zones or b <IMG SRC="http://www.eqatlas.com/ubb/smile.gif"> have to run around the whole world to complete one quest...<BR> Plus, why have creatures of several different levels in one zone? One minute I could be doing great and then something spawn near me that is twice my level and aggressive on top of that with out me knowing how to get back to my corpse because I was trying to escape this mob I knew I couldn't handle.....now I'm sol, I don't have anything I may have collected at this point and I hate the idea of begging for things. ok, ok.....guess I've ranted enough and probably left this hanging. But my mind keeps racing with hundreds of other things I'd like to say and I think I'd better quit while I'm ahead.<BR>Thanks all for reading,<BR> Reanos<BR> Druid<BR> Tunare server<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">taobob</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Some advice...<P>First learn the mechanics of the game...<P>You should never wander that far from the guards at low levels, and if you do and are getting beaten type /loc ... This will give the Longitude/Latitude coordinates and will make findign the corpse all that much easier... Levels 1-5 are also easier depending on the starting city and which creatures you are fighting... Always con creatures in the distance and try and keep an eye around you when you are fighting something... Remember that often creatures that are the same will come to the aid of their brethren...<P>Second, equipment...<P>Collect only things that are stackable, as you can carry more of them, and the first thing you should spend any money on is a pack or bag to carry more stuff in (unless you want to spend on a couple of spells). Collect the Bone chips and Bat wings especially as you can often sell stacks of 20 of these to casters who use them as spell components, and sometimes will buy them for a decent amount of cash. Look for Decaying Skeletons that have weapons that you can loot from their corpse and use as well... Remember starting out you are poor, so always turn in your guild note to get the newbie armor which should be all you need till level 5...<P>Third Relax have fun, after you get used to the game levels 1-5 will only take you about 3-4 hours hehehe...<P><P>------------------<BR>Blackivar the Cunning<BR>Halfling Rogue<BR>15th Season<BR>Druzzil Ro Server</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Aanyia</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I have a few minutes, so here goes.....<P>Since you've only started playing for a week or so, you're in the "still checking this class out" phase - you'll have no problem playing any class through at least L9 or so. After that, you'll have a better idea on what you want to do - be a blaster-caster/pet-caster/healer-caster (and the associated constant book-med until L35), or whack stuff around (and not med, but be semi-dependent on those that do), or a hybrid between the two ....like your Druid.  <IMG SRC="http://www.eqatlas.com/ubb/smile.gif"><BR>All the classes are OK, depends on what YOU prefer to do....<P>Gearwise, starting off, your druid wood elf could make patchwork (wolf pelts)- that'll get you started w/o being dependent on anyone else, for the most part, and can be accomplished pretty cheaply (all relative here...). If you don't want to do that, lots of folks basically give away patchwork, so keep your eyes open. After that, IF you can wear banded, that's the next logical step (look around for deals), but since your Dru can't, get used to your look - it won't change drastically for a while...sorry :0<P>Getting gear "within your level" (either fighting for it or questing for it) is a tough call (ex: in the time/$$ it takes you to make banded you could have purchased it for less, but if you learned the skill to make it, you could sell it too). By the time you can fight critters that drop decent armor & weaps, you more than likely have bought, traded (or given) similar or better stuff. <BR>That said, don't be afraid to group with folks a few++ levels above you, if you're hunting in a place that drops decent loot, or gives good experience. You may get less experience battle-for-battle, but it can work to your advantage - you may end up with some stuff (loot or exp) you wouldn't get otherwise. <BR>Case in point: When my warrior was L17 in Oasis, a L14 Shaman didn't want to team up, due to the experience loss he'd get. At L18, I teamed up with a Druid that just hit L14. Four hours later he hit L15 ...ok I hit 19.5, but that's not the point  <IMG SRC="http://www.eqatlas.com/ubb/smile.gif"> Nice kid, had a lot of fun - never met him before, currently on my /friends list ...gave him a bunch of armor & a nice weap I had gathering dust in the bank  <IMG SRC="http://www.eqatlas.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>Different level creatures in different zones: Outside the newbie areas, get used to it - it's that ~risk/reward~ thing kicking in, as you start to venture out from the relative safety of the town guards   hehehhe<P>Begging:  ...begging /ooc for freebies generally will get you nothing. If someone's selling stuff you need (particularly newbie stuff), politely /t the gal/guy & see if they'll give you a deal since you don't have a lot of cash & you're just starting out. If not, do without it for the time being ...it'll come. Joining a guild ~may~ get you some stuff at a discount, too.  <BR>Remember: If you stumble across people like me (and there are a lot out there), just by  being friendly & a non-pest, you'll probably make out in the end. (Another example: When my L4 dwarf cleric was scouting around Kunark, I started talking to a guy waiting for the boat in Firiona Vie. He just up & gave me a Lizard Scale Mantle!! All I had on me was a 3-leaf clover I found on the ground, so I gave it to him. He never saw one before, he thought it was pretty neat & thanked me for it).<P>I think finding a buyer for "common stuff" is a hassle; I personally give away stuff all the time. Twinking? Maybe. Returning past favors from other people? Yep. <P>SOL: ....see above & don't beg  <IMG SRC="http://www.eqatlas.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>My "main" is a 1/2 elf druid (...because not many do, that's why ....And Your Point Is?) I started in Qeynos, so I could hunt in Everfrost - sorry, Muse, that's MY fave newbie ground  <IMG SRC="http://www.eqatlas.com/ubb/smile.gif"> Once I got cammo, I hit the road - I'm more interested in adventuring than ~powerlevelling~ - you'll meet a lot of folks when you move around ....some you'll look for all the time (aka: /friends).<BR>As a druid, I never had a lot of trouble soloing through the late twenties, just team up with a basher or caster if you're over your head a little. BTW, when soloing, kiting bores me - snare, burn & melee works fine. Once you hit your tele level, you can port all over the place to find a group, so it's not a big deal. <P>Have I made any sense? Probably not, but at least...<BR>"Your typing skill has increased (14)" <P><BR>Aanyia Pointizz<BR>35, 1/2 Elf Druid<BR>Bristlebane</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Oakshot</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Val,<P>These folks have given you some mighty fine advice so far.  I'm gonna add my hard won experience, mostly because bored at work AND a know-it-all.<P>First, good choice on race/class. Both are good.  Second, put Sense Heading and Forage on your hotkeys and click them OFTEN. They both pay off later, I promise.  (Muse has fantastic info on using LOC rather than Sense Heading, but he's an engineer, you know about them...) <P>Get used to how your druid looks in leather, because you'll look almost exactly the same for the majority of your time on Norrath.  Don't worry, the other guys may tease you, but you'll make them eat their words later.    <IMG SRC="http://www.eqatlas.com/ubb/smile.gif"> <P>If you did lose your gear at 5, don't worry too much. I realize that's easy for me to say, but better gear happens along as you level, you'll make out okay.  I did the same thing with my first character.  Made level 4, got SoW from a kind soul at the gates of Qeynos, and felt 10 feet tall and bulletproof.  I was kinda naive at the time, and figured that the run to Freeport couldn't take more than a couple minutes.  I almost made it halfway through West Karana before a Young Lion got me.  I found out that bandits don't save your butt like guards do.<P>Just keep trying and you'll do okay. I've learned if you play in character, and maybe explain your situation, sometimes you get cool stuff you never would have seen before. (Note: DO NOT BEG. Especially over tells, if you play a druid long enough, you learn to hate the color purple.)<P>My point is: Don't get discouraged.  Feel the game out.  If you don't understand something, ask someone near you, especially if they play the same class, lots o' folks like to stick together, and druids are usually no exception.<P>Best of Luck,<P>Oakshot Stormfury<BR>40th Half Elf Druid<BR>Dragoons of Legend<BR>Fennin Ro<p>[This message has been edited by Oakshot (edited 09-01-2000).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Highland Warrior</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I wanted to add a little advice to the wealth of knowledge already shared here....       <IMG SRC="http://www.eqatlas.com/ubb/wink.gif"><P>Almost everyone of a respectable level will help out if asked politely. Note I said "asked" and not "begged", "nagged" or "ordered". When I was a new palidin I was given a moderate amount of assistance by other players because I just happened to be in the right place at the right time and I understood the game well enough to be polite and not bossy. I even was twinked by a few people and gifted with a nice breastplate, a shiny brass halberd (magical) and a mesh belt. Now my palidin is around 12th level and I make it a point when I can spare the time and cash to find new non-twinked players and help get them started with a set of cloth armor and other things that make surviving until level 5 easier. When I finally get something to replace the neat toys I got from those kind souls who helped me out, I intend to pass them along as well. I also spend a great deal of time in the newbie zones practicing my spellcasting when I get new spells by buffing and healing newbies. It helps me and them and is a good tool for investing in the future. I never know when someone may come up to me and give me a hand to pay me back for a past kindness that I gave them, and it is a good feeling to help out besides.<P>It never hurts to ask someone for help when you need it, the worse thing that can happen is that they will say no. Then you might have to suck it up and live with the situation but most of the time people will help out if asked politely and if the player can spare the time. Don't demand heals or buffs from people simply because they are there, it irks us to no end, and all you accomplish is watching us ignore you or walk away.      <IMG SRC="http://www.eqatlas.com/ubb/frown.gif"><P>Also group together in 2 or 3 people if you can. The experience is a bit slower this way but at least that pesky orc pawn will have more than just you to play with when he pops up and starts whamming on you. Another thing to do is walk around the newbie areas and scavenge the dead MOBs for stuff people leave behind (just be sure to ask any nearby players so you don't steal their loot). I like to run around behind a group of newbie twinks who are only out there for the kills and loot their dead mobs and sell the stuff back in the city. It is an easy profit with little to no risk and since they are only in it to get the experience so the can power level themselves most of them let me have my fun. If someone starts objecting to whet you are doing, back off and hunt somewhere else for a bit. A good rule of thumb is if they run away and don't come back within 2 minutes, usually you can loot the corpse with no problem, especially if you see them running from kill to kill to kill without stopping to loot. This can net you a decent amount of cash in very litle time especially after you learn to pick and choose the high ticket items like rusty weapons and fire beetle eyes which go for several gold/silver each and are plentiful on the play field. Then after you have enough money to get some armor and/or spells you can go out and wreak havok on the rats and bats and start gaining experience to advance in level.<P>If you are fortunate to have someone twink you, (and buffs, SoWs, and heals are twinks in my book) don't take it for granted that everyone will do the same thing. It is irratating beyond belief to be constantly badgered for buffs, heals and SoWs by people who think casters are there as a sort of magical K-mart for them to use at will. And if you do get twinked with a spell or 2, have the decency to at least offer to donate some cash to the caster. Most of them will refuse it but it is some compensation for the manna and time they took to help you out. Also remember to pass along the good deeds you receive when you become high enough to assist a newbie player. A full set of cloth armor and a shield  for a newbie is less than 4 pp and when you are out killing mobs that drop 20-30 pp items it is inconsequential compared to the rewards you can reap by having an ally out there who can come to your aid in a pinch after they level themselves a bit. Even low level casters and healers are welcome assistance when you are in a bind. <P>This post is not meant to sound like I'm yelling at you or anything, and I apologize if it seems that way. In my opinion the game would not be any fun whatsoever if all anyone had to do was whine long/loud enough and be handed anything and everything in the world. Working through hard times is part of the excitement of learning to survive in Ever Quest (much like in the Real World) and when you get high enough in level you can go back and help out others like they helped you and even beat the stuffing out of a particularly nasty MOB that terrorized you when you were a newbie (hear that Dorn B'Dynn? I'm coming for ya!      <IMG SRC="http://www.eqatlas.com/ubb/smile.gif"> )<P>Play hard, have fun and if you are ever in Freeport and need a hand come and find me....<P>Jonin<P><p>[This message has been edited by Highland Warrior (edited 09-02-2000).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Alsk</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">You think thats bad?

I skimmed over the above posts, so I apologize in advance if some of what I say is repetitive.  <P>My main is a Druid a lvl 44 Hafling Druid on the Rallos Zek server.  (That's the deadliest, most dangerous, most frustrating and definantly most challenging server you can play on.  It's the PvP Server where everyone kills everyone else. AND they take your stuff if they kill you.)  <P>That said.  Get a weapon, either a Scimitar or a one hand slash and a Shield. (use a shield until you can get a +Wis or +Mana focus)  For the most part that's all you need, well your spells of course.  <IMG SRC="http://www.eqatlas.com/ubb/biggrin.gif">  As a druid you don't need to melee, you can, but with the spells you have at your command you can avoid melee.  <P>Save your money for Stat enhancing Items.  +Wisdom is best.  More Wisdom = More Mana.  Due to the special nature of my server I never really wore too much armor.  once I got to lvl 14 and Got Spirit of the Wolf (SoW) I started wearing stuff.  So, basically, don't worry about patchwork or even leather armor.  Save your money.<P>Also, once you hit 14 when you get SoW you'll find people that will pay you money to have this much sought after spell cast on them.  Enchanters will usually trade clarity for SoW.  So, use that spell to make some cash.  On my server you can get upto 5pp from people for that buff.  (check the rates of you server)<P>Then, when you get your group teleports at 29, you'll be able to get as much as 100pp per telport. (rate is on my sever and is dependent on the need of the person seeking the teleport, where the want to go, and where they are.)  You can safely expect 10pp per person not in group at the VERY least.<P>I definantly recommend finding some higher level Druids on your server and asking them for some advice and tactics.  And check some of the other sites for advice as well.<P>Myssi McDoogle<BR>Druid of the 44th Season<BR>Rallos Zek<P>Wise Druid once say:  A Druid without SoW is a dead druid.  <IMG SRC="http://www.eqatlas.com/ubb/wink.gif"></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
