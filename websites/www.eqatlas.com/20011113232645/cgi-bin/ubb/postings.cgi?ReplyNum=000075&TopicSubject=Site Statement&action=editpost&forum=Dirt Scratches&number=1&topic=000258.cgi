<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL"> [QUOTE]Originally posted by Muse:
[b]For some time, EQ Atlas has been open (2 years and 5 months).  It has been the work of one man, myself, with the help of countless of you out there who have sent me over 12,000 emails in that time.  Things have changed a lot over that time, both with the site and with myself, both personally and professionally.  Since that has started to impact the site, and many of you have asked what is going on, I thought I would tell you all what's going on, so that even if you don't agree with me, you can at least understand where I'm coming from.

For those who are worried the site is closing down, it's not, don't worry.  I want to explain what's been going on and where we're headed.

Making this site for me has been a great experience.  I hadn't realized how many of you use and enjoy it until I went to the Fan Faire in San Diego, and got to meet a lot of you.  Your words, both there and in e-mail, have kept me going these long years.

When I started the site, I was finishing up my internship in Internal Medicine (yes, I'm a doctor).  Over the intervening couple of years, I've finished up my entire residency, completing it about six weeks ago.  There are a few facts about being a doctor that affect me, one is that our job takes a lot of time, and second is that I have an incredible amount of educational debt.

Now the last few years haven't been too bad in terms of time, I worked mostly 8-5, with occasional months where I worked 80+ hours/week (my bad months).  My nights were typically mine, and if I wasn't hanging out with friends in real life, I was hanging out with friends in EQ.  Since my main was a druid, I had a lot of time where I could answer e-mail and update the site, as well as map, while I was playing the game.

Also, last year was a pretty profitable year for me, as well as everybody that was making web sites.  The reality was I had a pretty crappy deal with UGO providing me ads, but it still made me enough money that I doubled the crappy salary I have as a medical resident.  Of course, after expenses and taxes, I think I managed to pull out ahead by a fair amount, but not by an incredible amount.  Most of that went towards paying off debt I'd accrued during medical school and the early years of residency, where the pay is essentially less than what it takes to live (I blame the system).

Then around the beginning of this year, I got hit with the same bomb that hit everyone in this line of work, that what we were doing wasn't going to make us any money for a while.  UGO let us know that we were having our contracts cut down to about one-sixth of the prior rate and, oh yeah, it's going to apply retroactively to November.  No warning, no time to prepare or put some away, and we were all stuck.  Now that the funding was gone, the beginning of this year was marked by a ton of different sites closing down.  Allakhazam was nice enough at that time to let me hop over onto his servers, since our sites complemented each other well, and I've had a relatively stable home ever since.  The big problem is that the income that the site had provided was not there.

Now for those of you who think that such a site could be created out of love, you've obviously never done anything like this.  There is not one web site out there that has even close to as much information as EQ Atlas does, including all the other big web sites, that was made out of pure love.  To say we didn't love doing it would be wrong, but for all of us, the fact that we made good money off of it kept us working the many hours it takes to do this sort of thing when we could have been enjoying the game, other games, our lives and families, or maybe making money some other way.  This is definitely true for myself.

In fact, I probably would have quit making new maps somewhere around last summer if it had not been making any money.  I had a break with EQ for about a month, after burning myself out completely on the frenzy that was Kunark.  I had managed to blow an entire 2-week vacation working 16 hour days getting the site ready for the release of that expansion.  Verant was using my maps in the strategy guide, things were good.  But if I hadn't been making money, the drive to get more hits would have been overcome by the fact that I wanted to take surfing lessons, or at least get in shape and make some passable attempt at finding a girlfriend before I turned 29.  It's kept me going up until a short while ago.

Earlier this spring, I had to take a break from the website to job hunt, which is an experience I hate.  After finding a good opportunity with a fellowship (which unfortunately makes me little more than I made as a resident) I then got sucked into AO.  I pretty much played that for much of the end of beta, trying to develop a database of places that I could enter stuff into, so I didn't have to spend hours upon hours making maps for that game like I did in EQ.  I simply didn't have the time anymore.  Only after AO came out, and I got really irritated with the state of the game, did people find ways to extract the maps directly from the game files.  I really didn't have a role with this game, and that wasted many months of my time where I could have finished up EQ or done one of the things I mentioned above.  To say I am burnt out on online games at the moment is an understatement.

All through this, I was hoping that Verant would allow me to make a compilation of my maps in book form (which would have been really kickass).  They decided that it would be a spoiler for people playing the game, and opted not to do it.  Don't ask me how to explain how it's a spoiler in book form and not on my web page, because I don't know.  Maybe it's the "official" nature of the spoiler that bothered them.  Got me.  And the ad revenues haven't picked up.

So now I'm stuck in a place that I'm not happy with, making a decision where neither choice is really good.  On one hand, I need to work quite a bit as a doctor (moonlighting, if you know the lingo) in order to pay the bills that have racked up in daily life.  I think I'm more in debt now than I was when I started the website, and if I'd been moonlighting the whole time instead of making maps, I would have been about free of debt at this point (not educational debt, just recently accrued stuff).  Hindsight 20/20 and all, and what's done is done.

The other choice is to keep making maps as I've done all this time.  The problem with that is that there is no end in sight where this actually becomes profitable or even allows me to break even, making it a bad business decision at this point.  Add to that the fact that I'm substantially in debt, and I really can't afford to be making bad business decisions right now.

So where does that leave me, the site, and you all.  I've decided that I can't not make money, so I'm going to still have to take the time it takes me to take money as a doctor (since that actually pays).  But since I enjoy making maps (and would very much like to finish off EQ), I will likely keep making them, although at a much slower pace.  As soon as Stonebrunt Mountains goes live, I'm going to check it and then put it up.  Tower of Frozen Shadow is almost done behind that.  The other maps take a bit longer, since the complex indoor ones are tough to do and it's a slow process.  Whether I make sites for other games would require the market to improve a little, I think, but it's too early to tell.

Also, in about a month or so, I plan on putting up a way for people to donate for the site.  This isn't a donation to keep the site up (since the site will likely be able to remain up until nobody uses it anymore), but instead sort of a down payment on future maps/expansions of the site.  If you want to donate to keep the site up, donate to Allakhazam because he pays those bills, as well as his own.   If I can actually make money to stay out of debt with the site, I will focus on it more and be able to make more maps faster.  I'm also planning on making a downloadable atlas in PDF format, which I hope to be able to provide for free via the old shareware concept (if you use it, then donate to keep it alive).

What if you don't donate?  Well, nothing really.  I will keep making maps, and keep working at the medical stuff.  This turns into a pretty cool hobby for me and I would do it, albeit at a much slower pace, even if I made no money.  The money was kind of the fuel it needed during the huge growth it had last year, but isn't required.  And we're all still hoping that people will pay for online ads at some point in the near future.

Well, I hope that's enough info (more than enough, probably).  I just wanted to give everyone a heads up on what's been going on and what you'll be seeing in the near future, since I've been getting a lot of e-mails which I haven't had time to respond to.  Please feel free to comment below, and I'll be reading the responses to see what you think, maybe you all can come up with a better plan.


[/b][/QUOTE] I love your site. It has been invaluable. Have you considered charging a one time fee? I would be more than happy to do this.
