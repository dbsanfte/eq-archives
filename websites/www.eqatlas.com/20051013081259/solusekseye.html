      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      <p>Solusek's Eye is the cavernous home of both the fire goblins and their 
        allied clans, and the Solusek Mining Company, an intrepid group of gnomes 
        here for the mineral wealth this area has to offer. Both live in an unsteady 
        alliance with one another in the lava-filled caverns, united by the close 
        presence of their enemies, the Solusek kobolds and Lord Nagafen himself.
      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>angers </h3>
      <p>This dungeon is a vast series of underground tunnels with several separate 
        areas. Overall, though, there are some general dangers with the zone. 
        First of all, it's very confusing to get around in. There are a lot of 
        small winding tunnels, regular and secret doors, traps, drawbridges, and 
        lava rivers. Do not expect that you will be able to make fast time in 
        order to evade an enemy through this zone, at best you'll get lost, at 
        worst you'll wind up dead at the bottom of a river of lava, not a nice 
        place to be.
      <p>Second is that it is difficult to move around while invisible here. Pretty 
        much all of the spellcasting goblins can see through even high level invis, 
        as well as the champions and elementals. This can sometimes make corpse 
        recovery difficult, and require you to find an alternate route to where 
        you need to be.
      <p>Third is that this is a place for short people. Goblins and gnomes live 
        here. That makes it very difficult for many larger races to get around, 
        and being trapped in a doorway can mean not only your own death, but the 
        deaths of your entire party as they pile up behind you trying to get past. 
        Come here with an ability to shrink, or I would go somewhere else.
      <p>Now for specific dangers. The goblins are the first thing you'll encounter 
        as you enter the zone, regardless of which entrance (from Lavastorm or 
        Nagafen's Lair) you use. These are, in order of strength, the young, cinder, 
        flame, fire, inferno, and Solusek goblins, and they all have wizards and 
        shamans in their ranks. They can be pretty tough in groups, especially 
        with a couple of wizards in them, but the usual tactics apply for taking 
        them on. Just watch the lava.
      <p>The gnomes present a more difficult problem. They are slightly more powerful 
        than the goblins, and have clerics and magicians among them. They, and 
        their Clockwork guardians, will all assist one another in a fight. The 
        biggest problem with fighting them is the faction problem. They share 
        the same factions as in Ak'Anon, and although you can move safely within 
        their domain if you've never killed one (mostly), fighting there a lot 
        will make you many enemies. Consider this before camping out the Mining 
        Company.
      <p>The last real danger is the elementals and the pit traps. If you fall 
        in a pit trap, you will be fighting an elemental that can see through 
        invis, so be ready, or avoid the traps. These elementals also appear in 
        other regions, and are the most powerful enemies in the zone (nearly 40th 
        level) and aggressive, so be prepared.
      <h3><font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>
      <p>Solusek's Eye has quite a few benefits for the adventurous. First of 
        all, it's a huge zone. You will never not be able to find anything to 
        fight in here. In fact, most areas go untouched for days because nobody 
        goes deeply enough in. This means good hunting regardless of the level 
        of your group. Camping the exact spawn you want might be a little more 
        difficult, but you'll be able to get exp without a problem.
      <p>There is also a variety of creatures to fight. You want to fight goblins? 
        Fight goblins. You want gnomes? Fight gnomes. Fighting each requires different 
        tactics and an entirely different set of loot. And when you're done, you 
        can take the loot to the other's merchant.
      <p>Last, but not least, some of the greatest items in the game come from 
        here. While this is good, they are also frequently camped out for a long 
        period of time. I have not once found an uncamped kobold predator, for 
        instance, in my journeys. It has to happen, but it's not common.
      <h3><font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
        <font size=+2>S</font>olusek's <font size=+2>E</font>ye</h3>
      <p>There are multiple entrances into Solusek's Eye. The main one that people 
        take is from the Lavastorm Mountains. Within the mountains, travel to 
        the large lava pit at the north end, known as Solusek's Eye (not to be 
        confused with this zone). There are two paths to caves on the southern 
        edge of the lava pit, the one you want is the eastern one, which will 
        take you to Solusek's Eye. 
      <p>There are multiple zones from Nagafen's Lair (Sol B) into Solusek's Eye. 
        These are frequently used as escapes from Solusek's Eye to Sol B, but 
        be aware that they are also used for the same purpose on the other side, 
        which has much tougher monsters, and you may be going from the frying 
        pan into the fire when you appear on the other side...
