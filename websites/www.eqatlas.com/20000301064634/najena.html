      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      <p>Najena is the ancient home of a twisted dark elf necromancer named Najena, 
        who carved out this hole in the hidden areas of the Lavastorm Mountains 
        in which to carry out her experiments, as well as those of her allies. 
        The undead walk the halls as if it is home. 
      <h3><font size=+2>B</font>asic Zone Information</h3>
      <p>Najena is a place filled with undead of various types. The rooms are 
        packed with them, with typically four skeletons of various types lying 
        on the floor of any given room. Added to this are aggressive earth elementals 
        and ogre guards, all of whom will attack on sight. For adventurers in 
        the lower level ranges listed above (below 17th level or so), travelling 
        in a group should be the rule, as simply walking in a room can result 
        in four creatures jumping you at once. Once you've hit 17th, only the 
        occasional Darkbone Skeleton will attack. For lower level adventurers, 
        hunting in the front rooms and attacking the creatures that are there 
        should provide enough excitement. 
      <h3><font size=+2>A</font>dvanced Zone Information</h3>
      <p>For higher level adventurers or groups, the zone is much more interesting 
        than trying to fight off swarms of skeletons. There are several areas 
        of interest. First of all, there is a whole key system to the lair of 
        Najena. Various creatures and NPC's carry the keys to access other areas 
        within the lair. I will use the keys to describe how to move through the 
        zone. The ogre guards carry a key ring, which gives you the most basic 
        access to the area where Bonecracker lives. Bonecracker is an approximately 
        level 25-29 level undead froglok who lives in a room with two lovely dark 
        elf necromancers. He also spawns the Barbed Leather Whip and Leering Mask 
        occasionally, and he himself spawns every 20 minutes. He gives you the 
        dull key. 
      <p>The dull key is then used to access Rathyl's area, where you can fight 
        Rathyl. Killing him will give you access to the key for Drelzna's room, 
        as well as possibly the Traveller's Pouch or Pack. He then reincarnates 
        (as Rathyl reincarnate) and sometimes has the Hollowed Bone Bracers as 
        loot. Then you can access Drelzna's room, who is slightly higher level, 
        and used to spawn the Journeyman Boots (but not any more)... Now you can 
        get the Ashenwood Short Spear and the Stiletto of the Blood Claw there. 
        Getting the key from Drelzna will allow you to access the room with Najena 
        herself, who is about 35th level or so and has several high level protectors. 
        She spawns the Flowing Black Robe and the Black Tome with Silver Runes. 
      <p>There is also a prison area, which the intrepid explorer can find himself 
        trapped in by falling through one of two pit traps located in the upper 
        level. There appears to be some quest that can be done from here, but 
        I wasn't able to initiate it, by talking to a damsel in distress. There 
        was also an injured halfling, who was unapproachable. 
      <h3><font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
        <font size=+2>N</font>ajena</h3>
      <p>The entrance to Najena lies in the southeastern corner of the Lavastorm 
        Mountains. It is impossible to miss, as it consists of a huge set of double 
        doors, with one blown off its hinges from some unknown force within.
