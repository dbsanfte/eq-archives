<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">I guess I see a couple different topics in this discussion.

1) Is it okay to increase the requirements for a game after it's release?

In this situation, I think a new standard has to apply.  As was aptly pointed out in previous posts, older games were essentially one-shot....you buy it and play it, or upgrade to buy the next version.  MMORPG's are a totally new situation, in that it is an on-going, dynamic environment.  This makes it INEVITABLE that the requirements will change as the game tries to maintain compatibility with ever-changing "current" standards in the industry.  Right or Wrong really don't apply here, this is just an industry dynamic, and really reflects the older model (newer version has higher requirements).

2) Did Verant handle this situation in an appropriate manner?

This is where the Right vs. Wrong judgement comes into play.  I have mixed feelings on this topic.  For an MMORPG, I feel Verant has noticeably poor technical support.  I am a computer consultant, and consider myself knowledgeable about upgrades and compatibility issues.  I have struggled with EQ problems almost from Day One of the game, and have always found my contacts with Verant Tech Support to be completely inadequate.  I have provided very detailed information on the problems, and rarely even recieve the courtesy of an answer.  I did get one reply, which was basically a re-print of the FAQ on the web site (Sorry, I actually mentioned in my original messsages that I had read that and it did not help).  I had been considering joining the Guide program until then, and my only reply to my over 15 messages was in response to the head lady at the Guide program going over and asking them to respond (the canned reply, of course). 

My point here is that if Verant wants to continually evolve their product, they need to provide at least basic support.  I have worked in the industry for over 15 years, and feel comfortable saying this is a definite weak point they seem unable to address.

So for the original purpose of the post:  Yes, I feel it is acceptable to upgrade the requirements in a dynamic game (and I felt the split server suggestions were valid), and No, I do not think Verant has handled this issue any better than they have handled past technical issues.  A good MMORPG absolutely REQUIRES good technical support!

Nuff said!</TEXTAREA>
