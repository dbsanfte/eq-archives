      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      <p>The Warrens is a network of caves that the kobolds of Clan Kolbok have 
        have claimed as their own. They are a combination of the kobolds old home, 
        as well as caves that the kobolds have dug out into even more ancient 
        structures that lie below, revealing some of the more strange creatures 
        that inhabit its depths.
      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>angers </h3>
      <p>The main danger in this zone is the front entrance area. The large number 
        of kobolds near the entrance make for good hunting, but in the worst situations 
        make for some very dangerous trains. Wandering kobolds add onto each battle 
        on a regular basis, so fighting here requires some crowd control or a 
        good group.
      <p>In the rest of the dungeon, there are discrete areas to fight. Throughout 
        most of it, however, there are wandering kobolds and other creatures that 
        can add onto the battle. Again, having a group is essential.
      <p>Specifically in the zone, the batlings are especially dangerous. Their 
        group is completely composed of wizards and shamans, making any battle 
        with them risky.
      <h3><font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>
      <p>The Warrens is a conveniently placed low-level hunting area for all of 
        Odus. Despite being located in the city of the Heretics, Paineel, it is 
        relatively easy to get to even for good characters, and you can bind right 
        outside. Evil Erudites could stay in their home city for the first 20 
        levels if they so choose.
      <p>There is also an even increase in the power of the kobolds as you move 
        deeper into the dungeon. Lower level players generally pull to the entrance 
        area from two directions, and there is never a shortage of kobolds to 
        fight there. As you become more powerful, there are multiple discrete 
        areas to fight throughout the dungeon, with only the occasional wanderer 
        to keep you on your toes.
      <p>There is also unique equipment found only in this zone. Soft Wicker armor 
        is equivalent to leather and has a signature look to it. The weapons found 
        in here are also unique, and have a very Japanese look to them. 
      <p>The other big benefit to the zone is faction-related. Killing kobolds 
        here will raise your standing with both the Heretics and Erudites, which 
        could be very beneficial for those making Odus a home for a while.
      <h3><font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
        <font size=+2>T</font>he <font size=+2>W</font>arrens</h3>
      <p>The entrance to the Warrens is located near the newbie area, located 
        in a small pool-filled room on the way to the Hole entrance. Good characters 
        coming here have only to contend with the skeletons in Toxxulia Forest 
        near the entrance to Paineel and to move briskly past the guards at the 
        Paineel newbie area, which are very unaggressive and generally won't do 
        anything unless you move very close to them. There is also a necromancer 
        that is relatively high level who sometimes is found in the passageway. 
        He will attack any good characters that pass in front of him, so if you 
        see him you had better be invisible.
