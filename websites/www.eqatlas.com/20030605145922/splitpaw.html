      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      <p>Splitpaw used to be the home of the Splitpaw clan of gnolls. Now their 
        tribal home has been overrun by another more powerful clan of gnolls, 
        intent on their own political agenda, who use the Splitpaw clan any way 
        that they can. Splitpaw is the site where in gnoll legend, their god set 
        his foot upon the earth, and the surface markings are his footprint. Nobody 
        knows if this is true, but hunters in Southern Karana know the three talons 
        rising from the ground that mark the entrance to the lair. 
      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>angers </h3>
      <p>This is a dungeon for middle level characters, and the difficulty of 
        the dungeon scales relatively slowly from the entrance to the deeper parts 
        of the dungeon. The front entrance has gnolls of around 25th and slightly 
        higher level, and as you move further in, you will encounter gnolls that 
        are much more powerful the deeper you move in.
      <p>The main danger in this dungeon, as in Blackburrow, is training. The 
        trains here are not huge Blackburrow trains, but little mini-trains where 
        the local gnolls decide to help out their buddies. Starting at the entrance, 
        almost all of the gnolls are with a partner at least, and so you have 
        to be able to take on two 30th level gnolls if you even want to walk in 
        the front door. Gnolls, like all the half-sentient evil humanoids, have 
        a tendency to flee. Since they have a fair number of hit points and are 
        really chickens, they can make it quite far while fleeing, which makes 
        it so that you have more gnolls joining in than you care to have. Snaring 
        or rooting is required in this dungeon, since having several more jump 
        in, or worse, start healing, when a gnoll is fleeing away could mean your 
        end.
      <p>There is also a problem because in certain areas you will be attacking 
        gnolls thinking there is nobody nearby, and some gnoll will come running 
        around the corner. This is a &quot;feature&quot; of EQ where creatures 
        can tell you are attacking their buddy despite walls being between you 
        and them. This is of special importance at the small room on the other 
        side of the first bridge. There are usually a few gnolls here, and are 
        relatively easy to take (if you've made it this far, you can take them). 
        The danger is that around the corner and through a gate lies two more 
        gnolls, who will come running if he is close enough, and are tougher. 
        Basically, if you hear the chains rattling, turn and run. 
      <p>The other problem comes because the gnolls have a heirarchy of classes 
        that is shared only with Solusek's Eye in all of Norrath. Basically, they 
        have members from every class within their ranks, which can make for some 
        interesting battles. You have warriors (Tesch), which are typical monsters, 
        but then you have rogues (Lteth) who will backstab you if you aren't careful. 
        The casters (Rosch) come from all different classes and include mages, 
        enchanters, and necromancers, and the &quot;healers&quot; (Nisch) are 
        both clerics or shamans. Few monster races can boast such a broad range 
        of ways in which to kill you, and this makes strategy and tactics for 
        taking them on challenging.
      <p>The prison cells are dangerous if you step inside, because when the door 
        shuts you are without access to the lever, and you better hope someone 
        comes and helps you out. The main prison hall does not have this &quot;feature&quot; 
        however, so you can go through that door and escape easily. 
      <p>There aren't really any other unique dangers to Splitpaw. If you know 
        group monster management and how not to train, then you can get by well. 
        The only other problem with the zone is that it's a long walk from Qeynos 
        or Highhold Pass. If you can get bound in Arena, that would help. 
      <h3><font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>
      <p>Splitpaw dungeon is, still, one of the least busy dungeon zones in the 
        game. This means that you can make good experience and money, as well 
        as some unique treasure, without having to worry about stepping on anyone's 
        toes while hunting there. This is, in my opinion, it's main benefit.
      <p>The other main benefit in the dungeon is that the rare spawns are split 
        off into their own little areas which you can hunt while not being worried 
        about wandering gnolls. There are very few areas where there are wanderers, 
        and they are only one at most, so you can easily learn their routine and 
        account for them. Also, some of the best monsters to hunt are located 
        near the &quot;front&quot; of the dungeon, and people can drop down from 
        the front bridge to the level below and access them. Getting out isn't 
        quite as easy, however...
      <h3><font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
        <font size=+2>S</font>plitpaw</h3>
      <p>There is only one way to get to Splitpaw, and that is by entering Southern 
        Plains of Karana and travelling to the center. When you see the three 
        bloody claws sticking up from the earth, pass in between them. In what 
        would be the center of the paw, there is a small dark hole facing the 
        claws that is the entrance to Splitpaw. This is easy to miss if you've 
        never seen in before (and the first time I mapped Southern Karana in the 
        beta, I walked over this and never saw it), so keep your eyes peeled, 
        it's there somewhere.
