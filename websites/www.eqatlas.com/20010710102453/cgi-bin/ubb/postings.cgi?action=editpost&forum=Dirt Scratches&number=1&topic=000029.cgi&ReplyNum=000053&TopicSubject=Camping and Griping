<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">Muse:

"This game, though, caters to the extreme one end of the spectrum where you must devote your life to hitting 50th in order to see some of the coolest parts of the world. I think everyone who buys the game should be able to do that, and the way it is now we can't, and Verant is okay with that, and that's what bugs me."

I could not disagree more.  The harder something is to get the more rewarding it is.  To me it makes perfect sense to have areas of the game that are only availiable to the supper elite.  They put the effort in to get it and they deserve it.  That is not to say that everything on the way to the top is not fun.  I will probablly never make 40 and thats OK with me.  I just choose not to put that much effort into the game.  Its liek Skiing.  I will never be able to Ski the double diamond mogul slopes but I am not mad at the Ski Resports for putting them there.  The blue square slopes are good enough for me.  Its not as if tehre is not enough to do in EQ.  Of it was easy to get to the top it would cause 2 problems.  One, there would not be much of an accomplishment, and two we wouyld all be 60th level and wondering what to do next.

On Camping vs "Playing The right Way"

I think everyone has lost sight of the bif picture.  For the bennifit of people in that charatgory, here is the big pucture:

EverQuest was a big step forward in online RPGs.  They made a fun great game.  Did they make an mistakes?  Sure.  The biggest being the static spawns and required grouping.  Changing those features would be essentually be like rewriiting the entire game and that is not going to happen.  So lets just accept that (like everything) EQ is not perfect and enjoy it for what it is.  Other games (including EQ 2) will learn from these mistakes and be even beter.

Last Point:

I am sick of people saying that Verant is evil.  Lets face it there are only two evil companies in the world:  Exxon and Wizrds of the Coast (I am still made about them re-releasing rare out of print cards making my colelctionw wortheless).  Seriously, like any company Verant is making the best product they can in hopes we will apy for it.  If they dont make the product that you want to play that does not make them cocky or evil.  It simply means that your tastes dont match what they are making.  I hate mint chocklote chip Ice Cream but I dnt think Dreyers Co. has some conspiriousy against me.  I just choose not to buy it.

It may seem sometimes like Verant is heavy handed with their customer service policy but beleive me, you have to be or the whinny bitches on the boards (.001% of people playing) would eat them alive).  At first they really tries being reasonable and commucicative with the fans on teh Internet and they were treated like shit by people with no perspective and I am sure they made a decision to be more forecefull understanding that will hopfully just make the whinny bitches just go away for the beterment of us all.

Sorry. I just needed to get that off my chest.
