This is especially bad during the early hours.  I suggest that an NPC merchant be placed in each town, (or the Priest of Discord would work as well) to whom I can go and purchase a bind.  Say for a cost of 10 to 20 pp I can be on my way in no time.  The somewhat nominal cost would make the convienance of the merchant a luxury and still enable PC's to try and get binds cheaper from other players.  Anyone agree on this? </FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Dirra Bey</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Yes.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">ZORIZHISS</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I like the idea but what if you are KoS in that area?

I actually think that's a great idea and here's another one to circumvent the issue of faction as I am an SK Troll and understand the Iskar's problem:<P>How about a small quest no drop item for all races/classes in the game that has so many charges of for example bind or SOW?  If one race doesn't have a pet spell maybe provide them with a ring or something with 10 charges of creating a pet...  I think it would give more variety to the game and as an SK i would like to be able to bind and SOW but I would also like to try out having different abilities of other races for a short while to see what they are like?<P> <IMG SRC="http://www.eqatlas.com/ubb/eek.gif"><P><P>------------------<BR>StoneViking<BR>Troll Beauty Queen 2000<BR>Loves Toxic Troll Beer<BR>& Halfling BBQ Burgers<BR>Exporter of Grobb cigars </FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Dumathoin</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">It sucks to be a race hated by everyone.<P>IMHO, they should have chosen AT LEAST ONE EVIL RACE that did not hate the Iksar. The dark elves would have been perfect match for Iksar allies. If this had been the case, then the Iksar could find a way to journey to Neriak and once an Iksar survives the trip to Neriak, then he/she could at least feel safe in the company of Dark Elf Allies, NPCs and merchants....and hunt freely in the company of their fellow sociopaths (the dark elves). <P>The fact that Iksar are hated by ALL RACES (including other evil races) is an extreme implementation of the game. This was an unwise decision by Verant. Just my opinion. <BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Teyli</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">How to get a bind in a city where you are KOS...<P>You only have to be in the city zone. I have bound many trolls and ogres outside freeport, at the zone line to the commons or ro. <P>As for paying for binds... Try doing /who for binders (any pure caster above 14). Send a private tell, maybe with offers of something other than money if you don't want to spend 15pp for a bind. Something you've brewed always works for me. As long as you're polite and honest, and take "Sorry, I'm across the zone and in a group" as a no, and ask someone else, you'll probably get a bind pretty quickly.<P>I only accept money for a bind if a person is A) Way twinked out, giving me reason to believe they can get more pp from whoever gave them all that fine armor or B) Much much higher level than me.<P>I hope that helps! <P>Teyli of Povar</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Dumathoin</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I understand that the NUMBER ONE REASON that hi level spellcasters go Anonymous is because they hate all these strangers begging them for a Bind or a SOW. <P>If I was a 30th level druid and all these 3rd level warriors pestered me for Binds every 15 minutes, I would go ANONYMOUS too. <P>Its pretty unfortunate, going Anonymous means you lose half of your identity to others. When you are Anonymous, no one knows if you are a 50th level superhero or a twinked-out 4th level weenie. <P></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Aieee!</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I think one aspect of paying for binds has been missed by everyone.  If players can buy binds from NPC's then binders lose one of the services they can sell to other players.<P>If you could buy any magic ring you wanted in any town you visited, then would anyone ever take the time to become jewelers?  Would any player buy their jewelry if they did?<P>I understand that binders often do not charge.  But requireing players to get bound from other players means that player-to-player interaction is generated.  Buy from NPCs in contrasts moves players to becomeing soloers.<P><P>------------------<BR>I am me,<BR>  <BR>Aieee!</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">yrogerg</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I guess i'm one of those pesterers.

A real friend will bind or sow you for free, just for the asking. <P>Why bother strangers and beg (or pay) them for Binds when you can ask your friend:<P>"hey buddy, I see you're in the same zone as me, can you spare a minute to bind me please?"<P>The lesson here? <P>Make friends in Everquest. Making friends is the single most important skill you will learn in EQ. <P>If you have lots of friends, you will always have free binds and buffs and SOWs everywhere, and anywhere you go. And you will never feel guilty about mooching off anyone, because friends will always do these things gladly and for free. <BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Zerthos</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Well, making friends is fine and dandy as long as they're on, and in the same zone.  After travelling to Neriak, where getting a bind is a non-issue because of the massive amount of casters always milling around the entrance tunnel, and getting a bind before heading to Guk, I returned to Kunark.  Now, the last time I did this, I completely forgot about getting a bind until I was PK'ed in the Frontier Mountains and found myself back in Neriak.<P>This is a VERY long walk back, just because of the necessity of using boats.<P>This time, I remembered that I needed a bind (only after seeing someone refer to it on guildchat) while I was camping Kwinn in Friona Vie (PKland).  So I headed back into Cabilis to get my bind, and go back to camping.  Well.  There were a total of 5 people in east cabilis and I was by myself in west cabilis.  Of those 5, 1 lvl 10 monk, 1 lvl 10 shaman, and 3 anonymous dudes.  I got no response from my '/ooc looking for a bind at the bank, will pay'.  All of my friends were a minimum 3 zones away, more than I'm willing to pull them out of their way.<P>End result?  I logged out for the night.  Just one more annoyance with the game (they're building).  Oh, and I didn't get one rare spawn the entire 3 nights I spent in guk.  yay me.<P>Btw, I play on Tallon Zek, where quests have the added 'feature' of sending me deep into the heart of the other races.  Damn that shackle of bronze for being a minor lightsource.  The only effect it has is to make me stand out like a lit christmas tree during the night.  Not the wisest thing for PK...</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Mithrus</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><BR>Something nice happened to me last night relating to this topic. I was in Lake Rathetear after a nice jog from FP (I'm a bard) When I do the "/ooc looking for bind in arena". Low and behold, some stranger says follow me, and invites in his group, then runs into the arena. After he binds me, he lets me know that he knew me via another character of his (whom I did remember), and that he enjoyed grouping with me.<P>I claim this as a classic example of how if you try to make friends whenever possible (read: not just twink every newbie you see), its simply amazing how the karma pays for itself later.<P>Hope this helps,<BR>Mithrus Wulfsong<BR>Bard of 27 seasonings<P><P>------------------<BR>(I must taste great, cuz I'm often on the menu)<P></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
