<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">  Ok, let me go at this question from a different perspective.  I work at a software development company and I have to admit that as we put out new versions of our product we often update the requirements such that the end user needs to have a better machine.  As to our product, we also have a client/server architecture just as EQ does.   
  However, there is one key difference with our upgrade path in that we make our new versions of the client/server backwards compatable with the old versions of the client/server.  So, for example, client version 4 can still connect to server version 5.  The way we do this is that we program in such a way that the older client still gets everything it needs, it just doesn't get any of the new features sets as it is unaware of them.  In addition, our version 4 server can communicate with our version 5 server or version 5 client, it's just that certain features our not available.  This would have been one way that Verant could have gone with their EQ client, for instance.  

  The downside of this approach is that it requires a much higher commitment, since you must maintain multiple versions of your client - read developer and QE resources are greatly increased - and you must code to maintain both API's in the server backend - read again more dev and QE resources.  Verant has chosen to take the different path of maintaining one code stream and making all their customers go to "version 5" - there are not many products out there that take that approach.  For instance, Microsoft does not make it such that when they release a new Word you have no choice but to upgrade or you cannot read any word docs; Lotus does not make it such that when they release a new version of Notes/Domino you have no choice but to upgrade - in both instances, their customer base (read big business here) would scream their heads off.  

  So, my 2 cents is that it truly is not acceptable to expect to be forced to upgrade your hardware to work with an existing version of a product - if Verant had released a version 2 of EQ, then it would be ok for the requirements to change to use ver 2, but to only be patching version 1 and be changing the requirements is, in my opinion, the wrong thing (read if this product were in use by big business, it would not be accepted).  I have yet to see any other product on the market require you to upgrade your hardware because of a patch...

Of course, tis only my opinion, my 2cents

BTW: Thanks for the maps and info - tis saved my life quite a bit and I really appreciate all the work you've done on em Muse!
