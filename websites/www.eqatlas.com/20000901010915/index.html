              <p>I wanted to let everyone know that I will be running a contest 
                over the next few weeks for one of two copies of the new <b>Game 
                Voice</b> device, a cool voice system for gaming. I will choose 
                the winners randomly from the people that have registered in my 
                <b><a href="http://www.eqatlas.com/cgi-bin/ubb/Ultimate.cgi?action=intro">Forums</a></b> 
                section at the time the contest draws to a close, including the 
                people that have signed up so far. I haven't picked a date for 
                the end of the contest because I don't know when I'm getting them 
                to send out, but the ballpark is two weeks from now (I'll let 
                you know the exact point soon in the future).</p>
              <p>Here's some info on Game Voice:</p>
              <p><font size="-1">Your level 50 Dark Elf just got PK'd by a backstabbing 
                Rogue! Have you ever wanted to tell your opponent what you really 
                thought of his tactics? Well, here's your chance to do it in real-time! 
                The SideWinder Game Voice allows you to communicate within games 
                (over the Internet or LAN) and to take advantage of voice activation 
                of game commands via a stereo headset connected to an eight-button 
                control unit. You can also choose between broadcasting your voice 
                to the entire group or directing your communications to private 
                team channels. Game Voice software makes finding and connecting 
                with your friends quick and easy, due to the integrated buddy 
                list based on Microsoft Messenger Service technology. While online 
                or off, you can take advantage of Game Voice's voice command functionality. 
                You only need press a button and then speak commands such as "attack," 
                "conjure," "teleport," or "heal" to respond swiftly and intuitively 
                to any situation you might find yourself in during gameplay. </font></p>
              <p><font size="-1">For more information on this device and to download 
                a free, limited-feature chat-only version called Game Voice Share 
                go to: </font></p>
              <p><font size="-1"><a href="http://www.gamevoice.com">http://www.gamevoice.com</a></font></p>
              <p><font size="-1">Since Game Voice requires at least two players, 
                Game Voice Share means you can always talk with teammates and 
                opponents alike, regardless if they have the full retail version. 
                The downloadable Game Voice Share is a limited-feature, software-only 
                version of the full retail product, and it requires the user to 
                have a microphone and speakers -- or preferably a headset -- in 
                order to use it. Game Voice Share is free for unlimited use. </font></p>
              <p>Check it out!</p>
              <p>By the way, hopefully <b>Kaesora</b> and <b>Timourous Deep</b> 
                maps in the next two days or so (depending on real life). I also 
                took down the <b>Najena Alternate</b> guides because it seems 
                the GM Event is done on all servers now.</p>

              <p>Other sites have recently posted something that Gordon said, 
                I've included the relevant bits here:</p>
              <p><font size="-1">As far as camping goes, about all we determined 
                is that people differ widely in opinion on the issue. One of the 
                most common suggestions is that we work actively to promote more 
                rewards for playing the game in the preferred manner, and leave 
                rewards as they currently exist for camping. </font></p>
              <p><font size="-1">Unfortunately, doing that would require making 
                playing the game in the preferred manner easier, safer, faster, 
                or more profitable, which would in our opinion decrease the fun 
                to be had from it. In our opinion, there is more fun to be had 
                from playing the game in the preferred manner than by camping, 
                and that fun should be the sufficient additional reward to get 
                people to do it.</font></p>
              <p><font size="-1"> However it's obviously not, so we're left with 
                reducing the reward for camping as an option. Of course, many 
                made it clear in the threads they they prefer camping over doing 
                anything else in the game. Hence our quandry.</font></p>
              <p>He goes on to say that they're not going to make any changes. 
                You can find the full post <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008246.html">here</a>.</p>
              <p>I thought I'd discuss this. Reading through the above post carefully, 
                I've determined that the true flaw at Verant is that their use 
                of logic is basically non-existent. In a nutshell, they've stated 
                that the way they <i>intended</i> the game is that the benefit 
                of &quot;fun&quot; that you obtain by playing the game the right 
                way should balance out the other benefits of camping (better loot, 
                more money, slower pace), &quot;however it's obviously not.&quot; 
                You're correct on that one, Gordon.</p>
              <p>However, he goes on to state that the possible correction to 
                that, making it &quot;easier, safer, faster, or more profitable&quot; 
                would actually <i>decrease</i> our enjoyment of the game. Call 
                me crazy, but if he made those changes, everyone I know in game 
                wouldn't have been upset they didn't get into the <a href="http://www.anarchy-online.com">AO 
                beta</a> (myself included). That's exactly what people want, and 
                if Verant did that, it seems in line with their Vision where the 
                preferred method was more fun.</p>
              <p>However, Gordon goes on to state that they can't do that. ?? 
                Which leaves them with nerfing, if you will, camping. ?? They 
                don't want to do that because some people apparently actually 
                <i>enjoy</i> camping (and cuz 50,000 accounts being cancelled 
                in one day would really hurt the bottom line), so they're going 
                to leave things the way they are.</p>
              <p>In a nutshell, what Gordon is saying is this: <b>Doing a dungeon, 
                as per our Vision, turned out to not be as fun or rewarding as 
                we planned. We cannot enhance this, because that would, trust 
                us on this one, actually <i>decrease</i> your fun. The only option 
                to make it more fun than camping would, in fact, be to make camping 
                even less fun. Since we don't want you all to have less fun, you 
                can plainly see how we are forced to make no changes.</b></p>
              <p>It sounds like the Sicilian in the Princess Bride. And I don't 
                think Verant could come up with a way to make camping even less 
                fun (I know I can't), so that's not really an option. The only 
                way what he said above makes any sense is if you pay attention 
                to where he stuck &quot;in our opinion.&quot; If you do, then 
                it comes clear that Verant thinks it's more fun to do it the right 
                way and you should do it for that reason, however people for reasons 
                unknown to them simply don't. This is what we in the field of 
                logic describe as a state of being <i>wrong</i>.</p>

              <p>Today I've put up the new <a href="http://www.eqatlas.com/cgi-bin/ubb/Ultimate.cgi?action=intro"><b>Forums</b></a> 
                for EQ Atlas! I hope that people try them out and start posting 
                up information there that others can use, asking questions, etc. 
                Register your name quick! (I actually planned on having this up 
                yesterday, but my monitor finally died at 6 pm last night, after 
                all the stores closed and after ramming two new monitors into 
                my car tonight (the first one was pre-broken), I got it up.)</p>
              <p>I've also let things be pretty relaxed on the boards right now, 
                under the assumption that people can be adults. If this becomes 
                a problem, I have no qualms about banning people on first offense 
                (now I sound like Verant!), because I'd rather do that than make 
                the boards like a military state.</p>
              <p>If you have any suggestions for them, either ways to make them 
                look better or ideas for new boards (I had a hard time choosing 
                these), please let me know!</p>
