<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">When I was but a wee lad of 18 years, the warrior spirit within forced me to hop a boat and wander to the new land know as Kunark.  Wandering the docks of the floating city I was approached by Jenora, one of my guild.  We wandered out into Lake of Ill Omen and comenced to fight goblins and some large red lizards walking upright.  Alas my group decided to breakup and go to the winds.  Being one from the cold reaches of Ever Frost I started longing for more familiar areas to explore.  I made my way back to the floating city and boarded the boat bound for(or so i thought) free port.  Now many know that Barbarians have exceptional NIGHT vision and thus would never become lost ona  boat.  But as fate would have I did and proceeded to step unto what I thought was the ramp down to the shuttle.  Alas the last thing I remember thinking was that the side of the boat sure was moving upwards at a greater spend then I thought I could possibly walk down the ramp.
Yup I had stepped right off the boat into Tiomerous Deep Ocean.  Now normally this wouldn't of been to bad but for the fact it was night time(did I mention barbarian's exceptional night sight?).  So as I got my bearings and turned to try and reboard the boat it began to move.  As many know the Kunark big ship is rather quick and my swiming was, though powerful, no where near what was needed.  Thus the boat disappeared over the horizon.  I began to swim(much to the ammusment of my Guildmates).  and swim
and swim and swim and swim, (ooc I swam for over 45mins real life time).  Once i got stuck in some unexplained whirlpool of power that would not allow me to move either direction(acted like getting stuck up in the corner of a building or some such).  I became fatigued and start to drown, by some freak of nature I was able to move once again.  Pulling hard for the surface and the promise of air kept me goin.  Once I hit the surface I turned 90 degrees and TADA there was this GIGANTIC Lizardman standing upon a mountain.  Fearing for my life but neededing to rest I swam for the mountain.  It was a deserted isle I had happened upon and fell over to the ground from pure DELIGHT at not being dead and exhaustion from swiming for the better part of an entire night.  Once I was able to get my bearings and let my Guild Mistress know where was I washed up she was able to come to my rescue and show me the way back.  For which I will be for ever thankful.

Thus the moral of this story is this...Barbarians don't EVER trust your excelent night vision to be taking a stroll on the deck of a boat for you might be finding yourself swiming.

OOC...btw I raised my swiming skill from 47 to 79 whilst swiming in the deep blue sea.</TEXTAREA>
