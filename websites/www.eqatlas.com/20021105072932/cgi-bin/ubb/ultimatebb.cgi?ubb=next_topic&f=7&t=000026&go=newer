“This house be damned!” cried Bashy as he bumped his head on the ceiling for the fifth time. “Why can’t you have built a home more suitable to those of a taller inclination?” <P>Juglar laughed. He had been packing up supplies for the journey he and his good friend, Bashy Nator, were about to embark upon. While he was busy gathering the needed equipment, Bashy was inspecting his humble home. <P>His home was a fine home, especially by Kaladim standards. It had two floors, which was rare in this city, as the city itself was built within the bowels of Mount Brell itself in the Butcherblock Mountains. The walls were made from blocks of marble that Juglar himself had spent many an hour carving from large pieces found from within the city mines. Unfortunately for Bashy, the ceiling in the house was only six feet high, as it was built for those of a dwarven stature. Bashy was over eight feet tall, and had to stoop considerably to move around. He was not happy about it. <P>On the walls within hung the many trophies from his life as an adventurer that he had given up so long ago. The Short Sword of Ykesha, a powerful weapon filled with dark magic, was mounted above the fireplace in his smoking room. It was a reminder to Juglar of the time he and his friend had narrowly escaped the depths of the accursed dungeon of Guk, the home of the Frogloks. Juglar had pried it from the hands of the Froglok Ghoul Lord himself, and took it for himself after he had slain him. Juglar reached up and took the sword and its scabbard down from its place on the wall. If this journey was to be as dangerous as he was beginning to think it was going to be, he would need its foul magic, loath as he was to use it. A powerful weapon indeed. <P>“That blade is horrid.” Said Bashy as he watched Juglar lay the sword on top of the reading table. “I don’t trust the magic within it. We should have left it behind, or gotten rid of it soon after we found out what it could do.” He added. <P>“I seem to recall the evil within this sword saving our hides many a time, my friend. Remember, even though evil magic resides within its blade, it shall never be used in an act of evil.” Juglar replied. Bashy nodded his agreement, a look of indignation on his face. The Frogloks of Guk were the sworn enemies of trolls, and anything that had to do with them, the troll didn’t trust. He had grown up to stories of younger trolls being abducted and enslaved within the jails of that dungeon. Juglar himself had heard of these stories, and along with his friend had gone into that cursed place to free the trolls trapped within. It had nearly cost them their lives. <P>Deciding he needed to be thinking of times less trying, Juglar spoke while he packed light armor into a traveling pack. “So my friend, have you heard from Boarenor lately?” Boarenor was a shaman from the frozen lands of Everfrost, and the city of Halas, far to the north in the land of Antonica, across the Ocean of Tears. Bashy and Juglar had met this powerful shaman of the north on their travels, and many a time the three of them had gone on an adventure. Juglar smiled at the thought of the Northman, and his wicked sense of humor. He had always been able to make Juglar laugh, especially over a dozen or so flagons of mead. <P>“That is another thing I’ve been meaning to talk to you about, brother.” Bashy said. “He has gone missing, and has been missing for some time. I have not been able to find a trace of him since he made the journey to Luclin.” <P>At this, Juglar stopped packing. The hair on the back of his neck stood on end. Boarenor commanded powerful magic, and for him to go missing was indeed startling to him. Boarenor was his friend, a true friend, and if what Bashy had been telling him about the evil that was on the horizon was to be proven true, they would be needing his help. <P>“That is dire news, indeed my friend. We must find him, as I am sure we will be needing his help as this trail we are heading down will be perilous, at best.” Said Juglar. Bashy nodded in agreement again. <P>When he was done packing the clothing and armor he would be taking, Juglar looked at the armoire that contained the many weapons of his chosen profession. He already had the Short Sword of Ykesha strapped to his side, but he always favored wielding two weapons at a time. A shield was for those of less mobility and strength, a paladin or a priest. As he looked around, he decided he would take three more weapons with him. An axe coated with a poison found within the labyrinth of the foul giant wizard, Velketor. Next to that, was another axe, a long handled axe imbued with the strength of Grodan, a god worshipped by the Umbral Toilers from the plains of the Maiden’s Eye. Juglar had found that weapon the last time he had been with Boarenor in what seemed like eons past. Lastly, he picked up his mighty great sword, Fellhammer. It was a magnificent weapon, nearly four feet in length, the blade made of pure mithril, and the hilt and pommel wound with strands of gold with embedded diamonds throughout. It had been crafted within the depths of the abandoned city of Sebilis on the isle of Kunark. A chill ran down his spine as he was reminded of what he had gone through to gain such a prize. He had lost another of his friends on that adventure, and the pain of that loss was still fresh in his memory, though it had happened years before. “Brell guide you and hold you in his heart, Kwasmir Meadowscent.” Juglar whispered. “One day, I shall avenge your death and slay the dragon that took your life.” <P>Bashy laid his hand upon Juglar’s shoulder. He had been there when the foul dragon Trakanon had claimed the life of their wood elf friend as he fought to save the lives of others trying to escape. He knew Juglar’s personal torment, as Juglar and Kwasmir had grown up together in the wilds of Faydwer. Juglar had taught the wood elf the ways of the blade, and in return, Kwasmir had shown Juglar the ways of his people of the wood. <P>A knock on the door interrupted the silence in the house. Juglar cleared his throat and said to come in as the door was open. A vision of beauty entered the room. She was taller than him, by a good foot, as most wood elves were. Her hair a golden russet, like the changing leaves of the fall. Juglar smiled. He had not seen the life mate of Bashy in some time, and was pleased to see that it is was her that was taking them to where they needed to go. “A troll, a dwarf, and a wood elf” he thought, “Never a stranger company of companions has there been.” <BR>“You boys done with your reminiscing?” she said as she strolled in and gave a quick kiss to Bashy. “We have places to go.” <P>“Now, Sunny… you haven’t seen me in months, and that’s all you have to say?” quipped Juglar with a smile on his face. “You would think you would at least give your other man a hug.” <P>With that, Sunnysky, as she was called, laughed out loud. “You crazy midget. I swear sometimes that you and my Bashy are cut from the same cloth.” She said as she hugged the dwarf. He gave Bashy a ‘thumbs up’ sign while her back was to him. All Bashy could do was roll his eyes and laugh. <P>They made their way towards the gates of Kaladim, stopping only to pick up some fletching supplies, as both Bashy and Juglar preferred making their own arrows. As they left the city, Injuree, Juglar’s nephew, came running up behind them, a pack thrown over his shoulder. “Wait!” he yelled, “I want to go with you!” <P>Juglar smiled at his brother’s son. He had taken to looking after his nephew after his mother and father, both Healers from the church of Brell Serilis, had been killed when a band of ogre’s had attacked their settlement in the Plains of Karana. He had taught him the way of the warrior, but the young lads calling had always been the way of the church. <P>“You cannot go with us,” Said Juglar, “the path we are to take will be filled with danger, and I will not allow harm to befall you. Not while there is still breath in my body. You must take to learning your craft, and follow your calling. Fear not, for I shall return. I always do.” <P>“Besides,” added Bashy, “you uncle is far too stubborn to die and leave this world before he is ready.” Injuree stood there with a scowl on his face. He didn’t like being told what to do, which showed the blood of Veign within in him. Their lineage was renowned for being some of the most obstinate and bull headed dwarves ever to walk the world of Norrath. <P>Sunnysky placed her hands on his shoulders and gave him a small kiss on his forehead and smiled at him. “Don’t you worry little one.” She said softly to him. “I will not let my Bashy get your uncle into any trouble that they cannot get out of.” Juglar smiled at the white lie Sunnysky told his nephew. She knew that what he and Bashy would be going to do was beyond her abilities to keep them from harm. He stepped forward and placed his hand on his nephews shoulder. “Take care of the homestead, and watch for the bards when they come through. I will try to send you letters as often as I can.” He assured his nephew. After a brief moment, he gave him a hug, and stepped away from him again. He nodded to Sunnysky, and with some hushed words she opened the portal of space between worlds and the three of them stepped through and they were away…<P>--------------------<P>Brothers in life... brothers in arms... brothers in death... so shall it be.
