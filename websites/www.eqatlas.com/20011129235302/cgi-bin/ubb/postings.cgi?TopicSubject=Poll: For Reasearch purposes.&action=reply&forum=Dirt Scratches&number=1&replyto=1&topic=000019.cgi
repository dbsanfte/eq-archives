[B]Just for reference: I publish a monthly journal on C++ programming. I print quantities of 1,600 or so. The journal is 16 pages. My cost at that quantity is about 90 cents per piece. This is two-color and 3 hole punched. Oh, and postage is about 26c US, 60c outside the US. And that's a Periodicals Postage rate (special permit).

Seems to me that the maps would have to be in color (not necessarily, though) That will make the costs prohibitive. I think the way to go, as you say, would be to get some advertisers to offset the costs. 

Anyway, to answer your question, would I pay $2 for a "book" of maps? I dunno. Hard to say. Certainly it's cheap enough, but do the maps change that frequently? That would be one of factors, of course.

Would be cool to get an e-mail saying. Dear Fellow Cartographer, A new/updated map is now available for your travels bla bla bla. And then say every 4 months or so (if updated/new maps were out) A comic book style book of maps was mailed out. So on and so forth.<BR>I don't think a hardback type of book would be appropriate for what the gamers would want. Mainly because we would all be writing in them all the time. Going to LANs with them and just reading them (EQ Geeks) hehe. But also, if it was a comic book type of thing, and you charged say $2.00 a issue. That would be cheap enough that everyone would buy them, and its not worth trying to copy and distribute them then. Then maybe once a year have a gold edition hardback book with whatever else in there with the maps. Maybe show a progressing of certain areas over time and things like that. <P>Ok, I will stop rambling now. Just Ideas<BR><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Now, here is the pole.  How many would Buy such a thing?  I am going to call a local print company that makes small newspapers and catalogs and see what the cost is for a certain amount.  Then Factor in cost of mailing and see if $2.00 is a accurate price or not.<P>Of course to help pay for this, their could be adds in it and things such as that.  Say $20 for a 3x3 add on the back cover or something like that.  Please post any Ideas you have here too.  Maybe Muse will see this and it will help him out and we could all get his Maps!!!!<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Buteao</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Just for reference: I publish a monthly journal on C++ programming.

I go to such sites as EQatlas and print out, for MY personal use(NOT for profit of ANY kind) ONLY what I need/will use. I bought the "offical hint book" and use it, but it had the city maps and TONS of suggestions on playing EACH class and which races had what benefits in EACH class. I got FAR more out of it than where to hunt at what level(HELPFUL info, but NOT the end of the game).<BR>If the periodical would be IN ADDITION to the continuation of the web site SUPER, but no thanks on getting it myself, I will do the extra work of printing it out myself.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Rylius</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I sort of started to agree with SolClaryn, but then I remembered why I would definitely pay for a nicely bound, complete version of Muse's maps and guides.<P>Yes, I print the maps for zones that I need, but two things would make a fully published version useful:<P>1. Most importantly, I typically only print the map and legend. I'd love to have the additional Guide/Description page handy for each zone, but I never print it myself.<P>2. There's always times that you are online and suddenly end up or need to go somewhere you haven't printed a map for yet.<P>I'd pay, as much as $25 for really nicely bound book, or I'd do the cheaper subscription idea too... as long as the guide and descriptions were in as well as the  maps.<BR><P>------------------<BR>Rylius Elfheart<BR>Paladin of Tunare, 25th Season<BR>Dragonhood of Marr<BR>Mith Marr Server</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Alsk</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I would buy the book...<BR>Thats all i got to say</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Epicurus Quickli</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I would def pay for either the book or the periodical.

I don't have any interest in purchasing a bound book as I have already created a binder for each Continent.  I would pay for a service that emailed me the newest or updated maps, that would save the time of going to look for them.

(Hey, that'd be a cool website name!)<P>Even better, "Muse's Travel Journal." Maps, descriptions, anecdotes, musings...  (har har)  Especially if it's done in the same exceptional style as the website.  In character, on aged parchment style paper, leather bound,you know, the works.<P>Unfortunately, such a project would be prohibitively expensive, and have only a niche market.  Dunno if that'd go over too well.  <P>As an alternative, I'd pay to have something similar in periodical format.

Is this something you still have on the burners, or had at all?

On many occasions a eq friend invites me along to a zone I know nothing about and I feel like a newbie, now do i hop off, print out a map and get back on, or take my lumps and print the map later.  I would definetly pay for a bound copy of maps, that I can utilize when needed.  As for writing, on the maps as one person mentioned, so write in the book, it's yours to keep, have fun with it.  I believe about $25.00 for such a book would be worth it.  If any new maps come out I can just print them out, fold them up and place them into the book if needed.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">chinaberry</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I for one would most certainly by a book of maps. I love this site but wouldn't it be nice not to have to wait to print out the maps. That is eq time wasted. The price quoted is not unresonable and heck I'd buy copies for friends as gifts. As for if it would be resonable for someone to do it the market is probly pretty limited.</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
