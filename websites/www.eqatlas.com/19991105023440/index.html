            it's a lot of work. Get used to right-clicking on everything to see 
            what they /con to you as you run. Avoid widely anything higher than 
            blue or anything that looks like it might be. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="-1">I also prefer to use the 3rd-person 
            view when travelling so I can see things coming from the side as well. 
            And get used to what the /loc numbers mean and how to sense heading 
            with repeated /loc's (you should have it hot-keyed).</font><font size="-1">

                <p>On a related note, I've sworn off Everquest for the next two 
                  days in order to get up some maps for you people before I have 
                  to go back to work. Definite maps are of Neriak and Qeynos Hills,

                <p>As I had predicted (not openly, but I thought it), the Plane 
                  of Hate opened up last night. Over the weekend there were a 
                  bunch of Halloween events on all the servers. The undead invaded 
                  Qeynos Hills, and the dark elves invaded the Commonlands, and 
                  Innoruuk himself apparently made an appearance (although I certainly 
                  didn't see him). I was able to take part in most of these, mostly 
                  through blind &quot;luck,&quot; and I was in Kithicor Forest 
                  dodging very nasty undead when the zone went down. Although 
                  I certainly appreciate the fact that the higher level people 
                  don't have much in the way of zones to hunt in, I wish some 
                  of these events were enjoyable for the lower level people. My 
                  druid (now 16th level) was very green to every monster around, 
                  I felt pretty useless...</p>
                <p>At any rate, if anyone of the higher levels could assist me 
                  in mapping out the Planes of Hate and Fear, I would greatly 
                  appreciate it. Essentially I need someone to go around and collect 
                  /loc's for me for both planes. Contact me if interested for 
                  more information.</p>

                  to my usual style, fixing a bunch of errors that the old one 
                  had (it was my first dungeon map, okay?). I also put in a new

                  and added some info on holes in the ice in <b><a href="everfrost.html">Everfrost</a></b>. 
                </p>
                <p>Also, added new sections for the <a href="arena.html"><b>Arena</b></a> 
                  (which will incidentally never have a map), as well as the much

                <p>So, in my effort to consume all of my personal life with this 
                  game, I've taken up Blacksmithing. This is partly because I 
                  had never ever done it before, and partly because my roommate, 
                  whose barbarian has been promising my druid some reinforced 
                  leather armor, has been demanding something in return. The good 
                  side of this is that after I do this, I think I can set up a 
                  trade skill guide here for all to see for most of the trades 
                  (we still haven't done Tinkering or Pottery, or Cooking for 
                  that matter, and we may never). Of course, it will take a while 
                  before I'm any good, since I've gone and run out of money...</p>

                <p>If you are not already aware, there is a new MMORPG that is 
                  hitting the streets within the next couple of weeks, called 
                  Asheron's Call, brought to us by everyone's favorite monopoly, 
                  Microsoft. In case you missed it, Aradune posted a broadcast 
                  yesterday morning about how excited the staff was about the 
                  new patch, especially the adjustable clipping plane (??). I 
                  personally thought the bonuses for resistances were cooler. 
                  At any rate, he followed this up with a comment about how the 
                  people at Verant think that Everquest is the best such game 
                  available and they plan on continuing to make it better. Needless 
                  to say, those at Verant are also aware that AC is coming out

                <p>Well, I've taken a small break from my main character, my ranger, 
                  and have been playing my druid like crazy over this vacation. 
                  Last night I finally hit 14th level, and you all know what that 
                  means... (&quot;SoWing for donations!!&quot;) Anyway, I'm up 
                  getting swarmed by elementals in Lavastorm, I swear they all 
                  have telepathy up there...</p>
                <p>There are two errors with my <b>Splitpaw</b> map that everyone 
                  should be aware of. Firstly, the necro room isn't where I placed 
                  it, but in the room to the right of that. Secondly, there is 
                  a secret room off of the lowest, furthest water room (the one 
                  on the lower right). In there you can find the high shaman of 
                  Splitpaw, Kurrpok, but beware, killing him spawns Nixx, who 
                  is a 29th or so level Dark Elf, who will kill everyone in the 
                  zone over and over again. It's happened many times to others, 
                  so you were warned... I'll be correcting this as soon as I stop 
                  being lazy...</p>
                <p>Speaking of lazy, I'm also wrapping up my Upper Guk and Lake 
                  Rathetear maps, and getting ready to draw out all the city maps. 
                  Hopefully within the next couple of days...</p>

                <p>The bug with the elephant mounting me and preventing me from 
                  killing it is readily solveable. Apparently it happens quite 
                  often, and people generally say that if you walk through the 
                  critter and then turn around and fight it, they stop doing it. 
                  Mostly people have problems in the Karanas with elephants, spiders, 
                  and lions.</p>
                <p>So, the Asheron's Call Beta is now over. I'm interested to 
                  see how that game fares against Everquest. I played in the beta 
                  over the past 3 months or so, and I may put up my own EQ Atlas 
                  guide to the differences between the two. More on that in the
