Comment as you feel...<P>I have been thinking recently about the concept of for-profit fan sites.  This has been on my mind largely because of the closing down of several of the ad networks that fueled these sites, and I've been wondering what the future of these sites is both economically and from a gamer's standpoint.<P>Now, I'll be the first to admit that EQ Atlas is a for-profit website.  If it had not been for-profit, I frankly would have quit a while ago (probably after Antonica had been mapped), and would have simply played the game for fun.  I'm not sure how a lot of other people who have similar jobs to what I have feel, but running one of these sites (at least a good, up-to-date one) is hard work for a hobby.<P>Could these sites exist if they were purely done by enthusiasts?  In the past year-and-a-half, I've seen many great sites come and go, run by enthusiasts, but not for long (Relentless Monks, the Dojo, the Shaman's Crucible, to name a few that I recall).  They last as long as their owner's have enthusiasm for the game, and die after that.  This is fine for short-term games like Diablo 2 or Baldur's Gate, but for games that last years and years, it doesn't work.<P>It doesn't take long to see what the result of this is.  Many of the major sites have all started to look the same in terms of content.  Allakhazam's has been the prototype along with Everlore, Caster's Realm and a few others have been making great strides to keep up.  The news sites (Stratics, Vault, etc) are pretty much identical, although if you know them well there are significant editorial differences.  It happens like in all business that you see everywhere today, gather enough stuff together to please everyone, and everyone will be pleased (or at least that's the theory).  <P>I'm not sure how I feel about this.  On the one hand, these sites are incredibly useful to play this game.  I use a couple of them all the time.  On the other hand, I have not found better information on specific subjects than I have on some enthusiast sites (like EQ Necro or Relentless Monks) that the big sites simply can't replicate.<P>I think that if there is to be a future for gaming web sites, that the enthusiasts have to keep doing them.  I think that the internet advertising is going to keep taking hits and that a lot of the big boys will fall, their profits not worth their expenses.  For enthusiasts, however, the profits are not measured in dollars, and through them we will all be receiving help for years.  I just hope it waits til I pay off my med school loans...<P>------------------<BR>Muse<BR>Bard and Cartographer</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Kieros</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Heh howm uch do you make on this site...always thought you did it for fun</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Kieros</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Heh btw, hope you don't quite making you maps, I mean they are the best, if you want quantity, go to eqmaps.com...want quality come here.

This site is #1 for getting info on traveling and mobs in the zone. I have used your site everyday checking for updates and for general talk. I can understand that you get busy with school and work. I myself would not be able to do all that. Please keep up all the hard work, It is Greatly appriacted!!

Doh!<P>First, as I've said before, your maps are the best! There is no better.<P>Ok, back to economics. If Ad revenue won't cut it, what is the chance that sites like yours could survive on subscription revenue. In other words, to use EQAtlas, you would need an ID and password. To have a valid ID and password, you would have to pay for it. I for one would pay some nominal monthly fee. Maybe you can even get a partnership with Verant and they can advertise and offer membership to your site right from the EverQuest account registration process!<P>You once polled us for how much we would be willing to pay for your book. Why don't you check how much people would pay to subscribe to EQAtlas!<P>Seriously, we've gotten so much great information from you for free, it just doesn't seem right in this capitalist world!<P>Be Safe,<P>Rylius</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Syddor Truxton</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Book? I would buy a book if it had all the maps and info like this website does, I would pay $39.95... That would be a really cool thing. That would save me some paper from printing all the time. But I would also pay $3.95 a month. I just want to have a good up to date website. Like I siad before Keep up the good work.<P>Syddor Truxton<BR>41 Barb warrior<BR>Rodcet Nife</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Darury</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Given the amount of time and effort this site has saved me, I'd be more than willing to pay for a subscription for updates.  I'd suggest offering something like EQ itself, with longer discounted subscribtions available.  $29.95 a year sounds pretty good to me.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Fafner_Morell</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Question: By "for-profit", are you referring to web sites which get revenue from banner ads, or from subscriptions, or both?<P>I certainly don't mind folks making a few bucks off banner ads, but the business news seems to be filled with layoffs and shut-downs of dot.coms which relied on them as a sole source of revenue. I hope you're raking in the bucks on the ads, but do you make enough off them to really consider the board profitable, given the considerable amount of your time maintaining the board takes? <P>As you point out, most of the EQ News sites are virtually identical - each with their own minor areas of excellence. I suspect they'd have a tough time getting by on a "subscription" model unless they all went that way or consolidated (otherwise folks will go with the "free" one which is 90% as good).<P>EQ Atlas is pretty unique. Best spot to go for maps, and that's about it. Which is how I like it. Adam Smith would be proud of your specialization &lt;grin&gt;.<P>For EQ Atlas, I suspect that many folks won't mind paying a modest subscription amount, as long as it's fast & easy, like some of the better shareware programs (e.g. WinZip). In fact, paying $29.95 to get a hardcopy of the "current" maps and electronic updates for a year (or such) would be great. Would also make a good gift for EQ-loving friends &lt;grin&gt;. But producing the hard-copy might be more work that it's worth, and if it's purely electronic (as it is now), I wouldn't be surprised to see folks illegally distributing copies.<P>Of course, I'm often a bit suprised at how bitterly a lot of EQ players complain about the $10 a month rate. Frankly, it's one of the best entertainment values I've come across, but not everyone feels that way.<P>Well, best of luck, and please keep the board going!<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Rylius</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">OMG! People complain about the $10 a month for EQ?! How can you possible complain about that?! I agree with Fafner_Morell, it's a heck of a value. It's cheaper than two matinee movies and that's only 4 hours of entertainment that isn't even interactive.<P>$10! That's it! I say anyone that whines about that should be banned, hehe, ok, maybe not banned...<P>Rylius</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Galadhlinn</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Muse,<BR>Just want to thank you for all your hard work.  Everything you said regarding this topic is right on.  I would caution about making this a subscription based site.  I of course would gladly pay to use it, as I find it the most valuable EQ site by far.  Were it to become a subscription based site, I think you would see the rants and and demands sky rocket.  Customers would demand maps and info with no regard to the time it takes to undertake the projects.  Since they are paying you, you'd better put out! *sheesh*  My fear is that you would throw your hands up and walk away from the whole thing.  I can only hope that the nominal compensation you receive from the ads combined with your enthusiasm will justify your continuing this site.<BR>Sincerely,<P>------------------<BR>Galadhlinn<BR>Wanderer of the worlds' great forests</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Feonyx</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">The Shamans Crucible is now under new ownership. What Muse was saying is that the person who originally started it dropped it because it was way too much work just like so many other websites.<P>I can totally understand this. I run <A HREF="http://www.red3.com/eq" TARGET=_blank>www.red3.com/eq</A>  which is a great (if I don't mind saying so myself) Paladin and Cleric site, but if it wasn't for the Guild that sits on the same page I would have given it up ages ago. Fan sites will always be better than the huge ones because most of the time the fan sites go into greater detail and the writer genuinely loves the class/subject he is making.<P>Feonyx Soulfury<P>PS. Muse I love your site. I always have. I have visited your site since you were still mapping Antonica and I will continue to visit you hallowed pages until you cease to have them online.

It was down for a while, then there was some "Ascension" page that had link to their web services with a EQNecro will be back soon... line.  Now it makes absolutely no reference to eqnecro and has a bunch of crap I'm not interested in.  Has it moved?  Did anyone dupe it?  I was told about the site exactly 1 day after it went down, so I never even got to see it.  As many people as have said how great it was, I'd be very disappointed if I never got to see it...</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Muse</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Just to clarify something for everyone.  My statements above weren't a prelude to any changes here at EQ Atlas (at least none that I know of).
