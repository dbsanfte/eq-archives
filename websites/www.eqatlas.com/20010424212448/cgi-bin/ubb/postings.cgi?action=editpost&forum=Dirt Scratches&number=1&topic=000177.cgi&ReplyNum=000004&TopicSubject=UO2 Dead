<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">Very well put Malefic, I myself was a UO player for the first 2 yrs of it's existence. Way back when it was first released from beta, the very first week it was out i bought the game. I rushed home opened the box, installed the game, started my account, and started dieing Immediately. And loved every hour I played for weeks, sometimes up all night. Then i started slowly seeing the problems with the game and the lack of support. But i continued to play logging thousands of hours, building my characters and buying houses. (Back when you could still find land to put them) I kept with the game and dreaming of what it could become and going on the promises of the developers. Slowly and surely i was realizing that i was being miss led like the other 200,000 other players. With the promises of a better world, and the new things they were going to bring to the game. So i was playing less and less, till all I was doing was logging in to "refresh" my houses, ships and check my Dragons and horses at the stables. 
So I applied to be a Beta tester with EQ, I think it was the second or third faze of testing i can't remember now. But much to my surprise i got my disk in the mail and I was officially a beta tester for EQ! I played the game for maybe 2 weeks, along with logging into UO occasionally. And it just wasn't there for me playing EQ, I missed the depth of UO, I missed riding my horse with my best armour on, with my Great Wyrms and Dragons in tow and watching the newbies druel, sailing my ship for treasures, and being this powerful tank mage with a title of Glorious Lord. EQ was this hollow "first person shooter" just ok type game. Compared to UO, and the possibilities that the game had, I quit EQ and started back with UO again.
Well to make a even longer story short i had my UO account on EBay 3 months later. Totaly and completely unhappy with the promises that Origin had made and never kept, the almost unplayable game they had created, and the total lack of support i was finaly without a Online RPG. After 2 yrs of my time and many many foul words thrown at the game because i died at the feet of some lame monster that i easliy could have taken out in 2 spells or a few hacks of my magic sword, because my game crashed, and some little newbie came along and looted all my stuff that was it! I was done forever, my hard earned account was in the hands of some complete stranger that i heard from freinds just bought it to make a profit on.
Then came along the stories of a new UO. One that was gonna make everything allright again. A game that was gonna be the game that UO was supposed to be and more. I was excited again about playing, even though it was gonna be another Origin product, I thought maybe they had changed there ways and were gonna bring a great game to the masses. Now i hear like the rest of us that it is never gonna happen. They have let me down again, for the last time. 
But in recent months i bought EQ Ruins of Kunark for a discounted price. Thinking I'll give it another chance, even if it's just out of sheer winter boredom. Well much to my surprise i find the game refreshing and fun. I like the idea if i die someone isn't gonna take my loot. Or the sheer terror of this group of Pk's running into the dungeon and killing me and my horse and running off with 2 hours of hard earned cash and prizes i accumulated. I also like the idea of new and fresh things introduced the game. I like that most people are nice and helpfull and there not cursing every other word. I like the fast paced nature of the game. I like the simplicity and the streamlined effect of the game, the word i used 2 yrs ago to describe it was hollow. It's not hollow it's fun, alot of fun. I like this game. Man im on Evercrack, and i need my dose every day!
And thats my story, and probably alot of others as well.</TEXTAREA>
