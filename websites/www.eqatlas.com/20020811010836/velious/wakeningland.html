      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      <p>The Wakening Land is a large forested valley on this otherwise frozen 
        continent. The goddess Tunare has a very palpable presence here, and is 
        likely the reason that the area is so full of life.
      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>angers </h3>
      <p>The zone is split up into several general areas, each with their own 
        dangers. The first area most people reach is the area near Kael Drakkal. 
        This area is frequented by the frost and storm giants, and is dangerous 
        to most unless they've made friends with them.
      <p>Moving south to the next area, which is another area of interest to many 
        people, is where the Dragon Portal is located. The area seems very quiet, 
        but in fact it is too quiet. The great dragon Wuoshi makes his home right 
        at the portal. He is on the same faction as Skyshrine, so unless you've 
        made friends there, he will attack you and, unless you're in a very large 
        group or very lucky, most likely kill you.
      <p>Farther west lies the geonid tunnels. The geonids are generally friendly, 
        but the tar goos which can be found occasionally there are not, and if 
        they attack you, so will the geonids. The next area to the west is occupied 
        by the &quot;flying monkeys&quot; or the Holgresh. These are aggressive 
        and are known to wander throughout the zone, instead of staying in their 
        own area. Although they generally don't, it's better to be safe. Further 
        west lies the entrance to Skyshrine. There is nothing inherently dangerous 
        about this, except that the tigeraptors and tigesaurs live here, and are 
        inherently aggressive to everyone who travels through. 
      <p>Moving back east, most of the top half of the zone is filled with creatures 
        devoted to Tunare. This means that if Tunare doesn't like you (you know 
        who you are) this is probably not the place for you to be. If Tunare doesn't 
        mind you, however, this place is safe.  There are also Sentiant
        Armors in this section, but they live in ruined houses and are easy to
        avoid.
      <h3><font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>
      <p>The Wakening Land provides several discrete areas in which to hunt, each 
        with its own faction involved as well as who starts out KOS there. Also, 
        most areas are discrete, without a lot of creatures walking between them, 
        so you don't have to worry about dangerous monsters from nearby wandering 
        through, for the most part.
      <p>This zone also is the site of an ongoing battle between the Kromrif and 
        Kromzek and the members of the Court of Tunare. There are several quests 
        for high level characters that come out of this battle which are quite 
        interesting.
      <h3><font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
        <font size=+2>W</font>akening <font size=+2>L</font>and</h3>
      <p>Skyshrine is located at 1450, 4500.
      <p>To enter the Plane of Growth you need to travel to the island at the 
        middle of the zone and to the top of the tower, where you touch a
        small tree and are teleported to the Plane of Growth. Be careful,
        though, the tree has a large clickable area, and you don't want to end up in the 
        Plane of Growth if Tunare doesn't like you.
      <p>Kael Drakkal is located at -650, -5050. 
      <p>There is a dragon circle at -3000, -3000.
