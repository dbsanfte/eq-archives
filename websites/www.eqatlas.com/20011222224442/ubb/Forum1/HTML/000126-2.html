</FONT><HR><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">In reply to that post by Rimm...<P>I didn't read the entire message, but I'm speaking about my own experiences... something Gordon nor Verant could recollect. Look, I've never had a character above 15. Why? Because always going from Nektulos, to EC, to WC, to Sister Isle, to Oasis... is not fun. There is NOTHING I haven't seen there... and this implies that Verant is neither creating new functions, mobs, nor quests which involve my menial 15 levels.<P>If you disagree, then please tell me which class/race to be so I can experience more enjoyment... I mean, do characters do ANYTHING in the teens to have fun? Except level?... I haven't seen any quests I can do, minus the "Collect 20 Beetle Eyes". <P>What's very sad, is that you can't begin to get those really nice items... unless you spend your own, precious, time, collecting, those, dang, Purity Belts, for 1pp each. Then... THEN I can afford to maybe buy an FBR. Why can't there be some low-level stuff, people crave? Something for the Teen-folk to do besides level?... because here, we point back to very-many posts about the game-point simply being to level and become Uber-Character. That's ridiculous, and many of us don't play that way.<P>So, is it so terribly difficult to cater to a few different tastes? I wouldn't think so. Infact, I BET any one of us could make up a fairly fair... and decent quest for a level 12-person to do, to receive some wild-looking robe... with SOME enhancing stats. For example... we have Epic Quests? How about not-so Epic Quests? A quest every low-level character can do... to get a class/race specific item? Which sucks, granted.. but hey, I'd be proud that I got the neato-freato looking robe... despite an FBR beating it stat-wise.<P>If Verant would listen to those consumers who OFFER advice, instead of whining... perhaps EQ would be a better game because of it.<P>X----X<BR>Vindayil, 14th Magician<BR>Druzzil Ro</FONT>

</FONT><HR><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">In response to Rimm:<BR>Actually, the full post was regarding someone who was complaining about the lack of GM-run events for the lower levels, in the wake of the Halloween events which were (without exception) for higher level characters.  My complaint was about how he referred to everything below 50th level as a "transitional" level, but I could also complain that they aren't making any new content for lower levels.<P>As an example, I'll review the changes that are significant that I can remember for the lower levels, since I've been playing this game since the second or third beta (I don't even remember).  When the game started out, I remember Hook referring to the continent of Antonica as the "continent of random death" largely because of the hill giants and griffins around there (more on this later).  The first big change was the addition of quests that actually did something in terms of experience, somewhere around August after the game came out.  This was a big step, because now quests were actually useful to do.  Sometime after that, the one lower-level "uber" quest was introduced for the Stein of Maggok.  Very cool quest.  Then, sometime this spring (after lots of testing) they introduced the quest armor quests for players in the high-20's to 30's in level.  Twinking became more prevalent as people reached higher levels.  Times were good.  (Note that this is honestly about all I can remember as significant additions for lower levels, comment if I missed any).<P>But remember that all this time, things were also getting harder.  Monsters were getting tweaked to overcome their inherently poor AI, and were given super powers.  The ability to attack through walls, cast while running and never be interrupted or run out of mana.  No damage caps on attacks.  The list goes on and on.  The "continent of random death" spread out, and I can't remember the last time a HG or griffin caught me flat-footed and got off a shot at me, because they are the least of my concerns now.  Now I can't run through Kithicor at night, or Lesser Fay at any time.  I can't hunt the mino caves in Steamfont without terror that the Hero will spawn.  Splitpaw and Kerra Isle (Ridge, whatever you want to call it) are no longer playable below 20th or 30th.  The newbie areas of Everfrost have 10th level skeletons roaming them now.  Cazel roams Oasis for days at a time because nobody can kill him.  The dragons have all been tweaked to be more "challenging" as well as the gods in the planes.<P>There are more but I'll stop.  My point is that the plusses to the game for low levels have not been very many.  Kunark was mostly a high-level addition, with a few exceptions (Lake of Ill Omen for people in their 20's, Kurn's Tower for teen-level necros, a couple of others for 30th level people).  The minuses to the game for low-levels are many, and *mostly* because of this drive to improve the game for higher-level people.  50 levels and an ungodly number of played hours are not "transitional" when Verant themselves states that the majority of players will never get to kill a dragon or go to a plane, etc.<P>------------------<BR>Muse<BR>Bard and Cartographer</FONT>

</FONT><HR><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Very well said, Muse. I couldn't have stated it better... I mean it, I couldn't have. That's what I was trying to say with my post, but I haven't been playing this apparently as long as you... but even now, I can remember many changes I've endured... especially in the 3 month period I exited Everquest. One day, just to shove a stick up Verant's bee-hind... for making leveling so dang difficult... I'm going to GET a level 60 character, and smite Veeshan.

</FONT><HR><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I like kparker's idea.  <P>We should be able to walk up to the NPC bards (the ones with the League of Antonican Bards Mail Service) and then ask:<P>Player: "Bard, tell me a rumor!"<P>NPC Bard: "Beware of the rising full Moon on the 13th day of this month, for there are rumors that werewolves will arise rampant in the Plains of Karana on that sorrowful eve!"<P>Not just a matter of spicing up the game, but it PROVIDES useful day-to-day information for the players as well. Best of all, it makes the game feel more "dynamic" -- like something new happens every day in the Norrath world around us. <BR></FONT>

</FONT><HR><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I think that at level 26 I have some consept of what leveling is like. I have noted that there is a certain image forming of the "Vision" of Verant, and many players/customers don't like it. <BR>1. you can hunt an ENDLESS line of the SAME monsters with random death from highbie monsters(which I think is STUPID and sadistic of Verant), Oasis is the PERFECT example of a BAD zone, CRAP loot, Excellent xp BUT random death from "trained" highbie specs or Sand Giants. <BR>2. the other way to level is to KILL guards, or other NPC(ok honestly I did a THOUSAND of those bard quests(eq postal service) so I could kill the BB one), if they didn't intend this to be WHY are there just SO many of them that can be kited into oblivion??? And why are they the best, fastest and EASIEST xp from 25 to 35???<BR>   My MAIN pet peeve is the Ubber Highbie, you know him, he is in YOUR zone SCREAMING for a Rez because he just "got killed by lag" or "the zone crashed and he got killed" and D*MN it he aint gonna go through it all again to get that level back. Then he complains about how HARD it is to get a group at his level without the UBBER UBBER stuff(one on Fennin Ro last night actually called a FBSS a piece of CRAP!!). They go on to call people of 25th to 55th level NEWBS(I mean PLEASE!!!) and tell us how STUPID we are. Then he has the NARDS to DEMAND a sow AND rez. LOL I KNOW they aren't ALL that sour and full of themselves, BUT if that is what level 50 plus is like, count ME OUT.</FONT>

</FONT><HR><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Look hate to break it to everyone, but the game SHOULD be designed for the middle level characters.  As you get better and better at killing things, it should be harder and harder to find things to kill.  Otherwaise the game becomes less an adventure and more like Doom.  Most people in the game want ADVENTURE.  I want ADVENTURE, if I just wanted to kill stuff I would whip out doom and try to get a body count like Arnold Schwartzenager.  <P>Therefore, when you are high lvl, the fact you need to find things to kill, makes the game more fun, becuase once you find it...you have a blast  <IMG SRC="http://www.eqatlas.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>Just my 2 cp.</FONT>

</FONT><HR><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Like so many others, I registered just so I could toss in my two cents here, even if I am a week late.  I found this whole discussion very refreshing and reassuring.  It's good to know that other people are reacting the same way that I am.<P>1. I'm not so concerned about the amount of new content at the lower levels, but then I haven't run out of fresh content yet.  What really troubles me is the way that the high level content is screwing up the lower level zones.  For example, the addition of Cazel to Oasis is a disaster.  Orc highway used to be a fun place to hunt, even though it was quite dangerous.  SGs, specs, mummies, and "A" Orcs made the place treacherous.  Now they toss in Cazel, who you can't even run away from.  What was Verant thinking about?  Why did they feel the need to drop Cazel into the middle of a well balanced, well designed zone?  What will be the next zone to get some uber critter dropped into it just so the level 55 crowd can have some fun and show off their godlike powers in front of all of us peons?<P>2. I don't think that anyone really objects to some level of twinking.  However, Verant chooses to ignore the impact that twinking has on the lower levels of the game, and the fact that a lot of higher level players are immature and irresponsible.  It's bad enough that there are level 3 warriors with full cobalt armor and LoWs, but what really makes it bad is that so many of the uber twinks feel the need to *tell* everyone how twinked they are.  Every twink Paladin in Unrest seems to feel the need to tell everyone "I've got Ghoulbane."  It's bad enough to know that any newbie character that I create will not match up to the uber twinks.  I don't need it rubbed in my face, and then hear Verant say "this is all okay."<P>3. All of this makes me wonder whether Verant is totally out of touch with its own game, or whether they are a lot smarter than it seems.  No one is going to dispute that higher level characters deserve fresh content.  But saying that the rest of us are just in a transitional phase?  Are they serious?  I agree with Muse 100% on this one.<P>4. Finally, I was pleased to see some of the comments about Lady Dae.  Just about everything I have read by her has made me mad.  I see two possibilities.  First, she's off her rocker and really believes some of the incredibly condescending nonsense that she spouts.  Second, she's toeing the corporate line and is doing the best job she can.  For her sake, I hope it's # 2.<P>Serreatus Foestriker<BR>Level 37 Warrior<BR>Sons of Tao Guild<BR>Erolissi Marr Server</FONT>

</FONT><HR><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I agree with Muse! and several others that spoke on taking away zones from newbies to give to big boys, thats takin from the have  nots and giving to the haves (sounds like the Republicans, LOL).<BR>Lesserfay is a friggin blunder, how can u have a wandering party of mobs (brownies) 45th level plus, when newbies have to get thru the zone (from steamfont)to get to the rest of the world, BLUNDER!!! (as was the recent patch, that they then had to patch to fix, and they wont tell u that, but back to the point). <BR>This game aint about gettin a 45th or 50th level character and then bitchin and moaning about there is no place to hunt, when most dont even fully explore all the places for high levels to hunt in the first place. And the new add ons/upgrades (like Kunark) should be the answers to that compaint anyway, personally I would like to see a high level (45+) zone/plane for every lower level (45-) zone in Norrath, and not on a high level server, but the so called heavens and hells (and even purgatories) of Norrath. I mean u have 16 gods, each should have its own domain, fully raidable!<P>Also, how bout tryin to play another class, and explore the Norrath with it, I fully have a charge of the totally different ways you have to play, from class to class!<P>Everquest is like the US, it may have alot of faults, that are constantly being worked out, but she's the best we got, and no one has done better yet, so love it or leave it!!!<P>he he he, just my thought,<P>------------------<BR>Zanis Stratos, Master of the Universe</FONT>
