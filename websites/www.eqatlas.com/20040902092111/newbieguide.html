        <h3>or how to get to 5th level without really trying...</h3>
      </center>
      <p>This is a very unique time in Everquest history, for at no other time 
        since its inception has there been this many newbies roaming the zones 
        of Norrath as now. Everybody is a newbie at some point, and nobody wants 
        to stay a newbie forever, so I've decided to give some advice to people 
        on how to get out of this phase quickly and to set yourself up for later 
        on, when you really pay for/benefit from the ground you laid as a newbie. 
        Note that I chose 5th level as the point when you are no longer a "newbie" 
        (for which I'm sure I'll get many emails). I chose this point because 
        it is where everyone has advanced enough to get some class-defining skills 
        and abilities and to really start becoming something other than a professional 
        rat slayer. 
      <ul>

          Kiddies...</a> 
      </ul>
      <p>I'll start out with some facts about newbies that everyone needs to be 
        aware of, because they dictate what I'm going to tell you below and give 
        a guide for how to proceed through the lower levels. 
      <ul>
        <li>Newbies start out with 20 units each of food and drink, a light source, 
          a weapon, 2 spells (depending on class) and a Guild Note. These items 
          can not be dropped, traded, or sold. 
        <li>All newbie items reappear following death. This also means that you 
          will not leave a dead body. These items will reappear when you do until 
          you reach 10th level. 
        <li>Newbies do not lose experience points when they die until they reach 
          11th level. 
        <li>Fighting ability of all newbies is roughly equivalent, taking into 
          account both melee and spell combat. In addition, the fighting abilities 
          of monsters of the same level is roughly equivalent (or more predictable) 
          than at higher levels. 
        <li>The experience points obtained for a kill depends on the relative 
          strength of the monster you killed (more powerful than you give more 
          exp) and if you are in a group (due to the splitting of the exp). 
        <li>Skill levels increase with use, independent of training. The only 
          time a skill <i>must</i> be trained is when you are learning it for 
          the first time. 
        <li>Skill levels <i>only</i> increase with use. If you do not use a skill 
          it will not get better as you go up in level or from any other cause. 
        <li>Maximum skill level is five times your level plus five. For instance, 
          a 3rd level ranger's maximum skill level in 1H Slashing would be 20 
          ((3 x 5) + 5 = 20). There are some exceptions to this, but this is a 
          general rule.
        <li>Intelligence has a significant effect on how quickly a skill goes 
          up. The lower the intelligence, the slower you advance in your skills. 
      </ul>
      <p>Okay, now that you have the basic rules that affect a newbie's life, 
        I'll discuss guidelines that will help you do well as a newbie. 
      <h3><a name="firstday">Your First Day as a Newbie</a></h3>
      <p>You've spawned. You are standing in your starting city in your everyday 
        clothes, eager for adventure. What do you do? Find your guild. Why would 
        I suggest such a thing? Three reasons. First, you need to find your guildmaster 
        and turn in the guild note in order to obtain your guild tunic. This gives 
        you a small boost to AC, and in some cases (monks in particular) actually 
        changes your appearance, which is fun. Second, there may be quests that 
        you can obtain from the guild members to keep in mind for later, if you 
        can't do them now. Third, it allows you to train in your primary weapon 
        skill (see more on how to choose that later in the <a href="newbieguide.html#skills">Training 
        your Skills</a> section). This makes the first couple of levels a little 
        less painful. 
      <p>The second task (and this is actually probably the first thing most people 
        do) is arrange your icons on your screen. I won't go into detail about 
        the mechanics of actually doing this, that's in your manual. I would recommend, 
        however, that you place your major attack abilities at the top. Depending 
        on class and race, these include Melee Weapon (for everyone) and Slam, 
        Kick, or Bash. Next, you should place any combat-related buttons up there 
        as well, such as Mend (for monks), Harm Touch (for shadowknights), etc. 
        This lets you use them without fishing around through different screens 
        during a battle. Next (if you have room) is to place other icons for skills 
        you are going to want to practice frequently here (more on the purpose 
        of that in the When to Train section). This is invariably Sense Heading 
        for everyone, and Taunt for warrior types. If you have room left (usually 
        only mages) it's nice to have your Spells button there as well as Sit/Stand 
        and Run/Walk. Play around with it, you'll find an arrangement you like. 
        Also, if you're feeling &quot;advanced,&quot; check out how to make a 
        button to use the /loc command and plant that on your main page of buttons, 
        it will help you not be so lost.
      <p>Now you're all set and ready to adventure, head on to the next section! 
      <h3><a name="kill">What to Kill</a></h3>
      As much as we all like to roleplay, there are certain truths about the world 
      of Everquest. One of those is that killing is the path to power. You have 
      to kill monsters to acquire experience to obtain higher levels to get more 
      abilities to more effectively kill. They also have money to buy better weapons/armor/spells 
      to do the same. This changes somewhat at higher levels, but nobody could 
      argue that this is the primary task of a newbie. So what does a newbie kill? 
      <p>The easy answer is: everything. A newbie will learn quickly that this 
        doesn't sound like what it means, though, and you must only attack creatures 
        that are roughly your equivalent in battle. You do this using the /con 
        or c command, to consider the enemy. This will give you two pieces of 
        information. The first part says something about how they regard you, 
        with like, dislike, or ambivalence (more on this in the section <a href="newbieguide.html#friends">How 
        to Make Friends/Enemies</a>). The second part is what we're concerned 
        about here. It states a range from <font color="#008000">Easy</font> to 
        <font color="#0000ff">Upper Hand</font> to <font color="#ffffff">Even</font> 
        to <font color="#ffff00">Gamble</font> to <font color="#ff0000">Tombstone</font> 
        (as they get harder, if you couldn't figure that out). These are terms 
        you will become very familiar with. At 1st level, everything is at least 
        even with you. You should fight these at first level. At higher levels, 
        consider fighting anything <font color="#ffffff">Even</font> or <font color="#0000ff">Upper 
        Hand</font>. You get no experience for <font color="#008000">Easy</font> 
        (at least not at first), and *never* fight a <font color="#ffff00">Gamble</font> 
        or <font color="#ff0000">Tombstone</font> by yourself. You will die, I 
        guarantee it. Which brings us to the next part... 
      <p>One thing to be aware of before you move on, however, is the monster's 
        propensity to group together. For example, at the Gates of Qeynos, you 
        can take on snakes, rats, bats, fire beetles, Klikniks, and skeletons. 
        The first three you can attack with abandon and not expect a nearby snake/rat/bat 
        to assist his comrade. Fire beetles and Klikniks are a different matter, 
        as any one of them will turn on you if you are attacking another of their 
        kind. This is great if you're tough enough to take them, but if you are 
        even with them you better start running. Be aware that most "intelligent" 
        creatures share this behavior, including kobolds, gnolls, orcs, etc. 
      <h3><a name="run">When to Run and When to Stand Your Ground</a></h3>
      <p>An inherent part of the fun of roleplaying is feeling like you are the 
        character you are playing, so you should feel some sort of fear when considering 
        that your character in the roleplaying environment is going to die. But 
        for a newbie, the only negative consequence from death is that you have 
        to return to your body to retrieve your guild tunic and whatever loot 
        you've gathered, and if you're a spellcaster you have to rememorize. Until 
        4th level you get your food and water renewed, and you don't lose exp 
        until 5th. 
      <p>So when to run? When you know for a fact that there is no chance to win 
        the battle. Fighting that <font color="#ffffff">Even</font> decaying skeleton 
        with a rusty 2H sword is likely going to end in your demise. You need 
        to decide early on in the fight if you are doing comparable damage to 
        the monster, and based on that decide whether or not to stay until the 
        end of the fight. You can tell this just by watching your health bars 
        and the text screen for the amount of damage you and the monster are doing 
        to each other. As a guideline, if you reach half your health and the monster 
        still has two-thirds of its health left, you better start running. Note 
        that there is some variance in how you fare against monsters, even ones 
        you have the <font color="#0000ff">Upper Hand</font> against, because 
        they may be equipped with weapons and so do more damage to you, they may 
        become frenzied, or you may just be unlucky. 
      <p>So why would you stay in a fight that you might lose? First of all, there 
        is little to lose (refer to above). Secondly, you get major experience 
        at low levels for defeating monsters that are even with you (a bubble 
        at first level, one-half of one at second). Most battles with them will 
        be close, so you just have to stick them out until the end. Third, running 
        late is the surest way to die. There are very few characters (except those 
        with very high agilities) who can outrun an attacking monster. Muse can 
        do it because he has a song to assist him, but he is also not a newbie. 
        When you run, the monster gets to take shots at your back, with a bonus, 
        so he is still doing damage, and you no longer are. If you run, be sure 
        that you can take enough damage to last until you reach the guards. If 
        you can't you might as well stay and fight, because you could get lucky, 
        which is better than being dead. 
      <h3><a name="friends">How to Make Friends/Enemies</a></h3>
      <p>Factions are an important part of the game that you should start out 
        being aware of so that you don't run into serious problems later on. Factions 
        are a fancy name for how you are viewed by different groups of NPC's and 
        monsters. This is the first part of the /con or c command mentioned above. 
        If you have a good faction standing, /con'ing a monster will show something 
        that sounds like they like you. If you are neutral they usually regard 
        you indifferently, and if they dislike you it states something about them 
        wanting to kill you. You get the idea. 
      <p>Depending on your race/class/diety you start out with certain faction 
        standings with all other groups in Norrath. I could write a whole article 
        on this itself, but it would bore everyone. The times it really plays 
        a difference are with races and classes that are considered <i>evil</i> 
        by others, such as necromancers or trolls, ogres, and dark elves. You 
        will have a hard time trying to find someone to trade from in civilized 
        lands simply because of your faction standing. In fact, many guards will 
        attack you on sight. Most monster groups have a negative faction standing 
        with almost all races/classes. 
      <p>An example of the complexity involved is, for instance, the wolves and 
        bears in the Qeynos hills. They are factioned with the rangers and druids 
        of Surefall Glades, and if you attack too many of them you could run into 
        not only the problem of being attacked on sight by every wolf and bear 
        you run across (rabid grizzly anyone?) but of not being able to deal with 
        or speak to the rangers and druids, as you've declared yourself a "poacher" 
        to them. And it's an ever-worsening condition, because every one of these 
        creatures will begin to attack you on sight, thereby worsening your standing. 
        These interactions are complex and can weigh heavily on you later on, 
        so depending on how you want your life to be at 20th level, consider seriously 
        what you attack and what you don't. 
      <h3><a name="skills">Training Your Skills</a></h3>
      <p>When I was playing the beta, I occasionally ran into people who would 
        marvel that at 6th level, I was over level 20 in my skill at Tailoring, 
        and could produce a patchwork leather item about every other attempt, 
        whereas they hadn't even been able to train in it. How did I do it? I 
        never trained in other skills. The basics behind training are that skills 
        go up on their own with use. You only have to train a skill when you haven't 
        possessed it before. This becomes an even greater issue with the more 
        difficult advanced trade skills, like blacksmithing, where the conventional 
        teaching is to not even attempt to create anything until you are at least 
        level 25. How will you ever get there without practicing? You have to 
        have 25 train points put into it. 
      <p>Basically, the guideline I personally follow for training is the following. 
        At first level, I dump all of my training points into my main weapon skill, 
        and kick if I have it. This gives me a slight push over the monsters I 
        fight. For every level after that, I don't spend any points on anything 
        unless I'm learning it for the first time. Note that you should be aware 
        of what level you get new skills, because when you go up the level these 
        skills appear the same as the others on the training screen and you won't 
        remember if you have never trained in it before. This way, when I hit 
        fifth level I usually have about 20 train points and can invest these 
        in a trade skill to make more cash. 
      <p>There are other things you should note early on. When fighting, you will 
        likely be using a variety of weapons and weapon types, unless you find 
        one that you love. Be aware that your intelligence affects how quickly 
        you learn skills. As you fight things, your skills will increase until 
        they max out for that level. Fighting with that skill after that point 
        will not improve it, so you might as well switch to using a different 
        skill. For instance, Muse chooses to fight with 1H slashing weapons, but 
        being a smart guy, he maxes out fairly quickly in that skill once he reaches 
        a new level. As a Bard, he will also likely find himself engaged in battle 
        with a musical instrument in his hands, and will need to fight hand-to-hand. 
        So after I've maxed out my 1H Slashing skill, I take the weapon out of 
        my hands and duke it out with monsters to increase my Hand-to-Hand skill. 
        I will never be as good as my buddy Yifoling, the monk, but being able 
        to use my hands to play an instrument makes my songs so much more powerful 
        that being able to fight hand-to-hand is really worthwhile. For Warrior-types, 
        the smarter ones really benefit from this type of play, given that you 
        might find yourself in dire straits at some point with a weapon that is 
        not your typical one. For dumb warriors (ogres and trolls) you may not 
        be able to learn more than two different types, but the smarter ones (dark 
        elves and erudites) you can learn all the different classes quite well. 
        And Hand-to-Hand always helps when trying to find your body without a 
        Bard's assistance... 
      <h3><a name="money">Money and Equipment</a></h3>
      <p>Like real life, money and equipment are a big concern to your budding 
        newbie. Some classes (mixed warrior/spellcasting types) get hit very hard 
        by wanting both spells and weapons/armor, but everyone suffers from the 
        "if only I had one more gold piece" problem. There is really no trick 
        to this, but I can give advice on the matter. 
      <p>First of all, don't spend beyond your means. The game was designed so 
        that as you become higher level, you earn more money from the monsters 
        you kill and so can buy better stuff. Hoarding 10 platinum to buy that 
        chain helm at 4th level is a ridiculous waste of money, you could have 
        bought half a suit of real leather at that point and have double the AC 
        bonus from it. It's very tempting, but don't do it. 
      <p>Secondly, gather everything. I often see people leaving bats lying on 
        the ground with wings on them, which I promptly take. Items like this 
        are stackable, so you could carry dozens of them on your person without 
        losing carrying space. Plus they go for about 8 copper each, which isn't 
        a lot of money, but if you're carrying around a dozen of them, that's 
        worth a gold right there. It all adds up. 
      <p>Third, always keep reserves in the bank. Know where the bank is in your 
        town. This becomes very important at 10th level and higher, which is when 
        death means no more free weapon or food and water. Keep a weapon on reserve 
        in the bank (if you ignored my above advice to train in Hand-to-Hand) 
        so that running to your body doesn't mean another one of your bodies litters 
        the landscape for others to trip over and laugh at. This goes for food 
        and water as well. Things have changed recently so that food and water 
        play a more important role in daily life. In the old days of beta, I wouldn't 
        even bother buying food and water if I ran out, because having it only 
        got rid of that message that I was starving and thirsty, and it saved 
        money. Now lacking food and water means that you can't recover your stamina, 
        and you lose stamina more quickly now, by jumping for instance, that it 
        really becomes important to have food on you. 
      <h3><a name="playnice">How to Play Nice with the Other Kiddies...</a></h3>
      <p>Now on to my final point (or pet peeve, depending on how you look at 
        it). This game is refreshing because it really fosters comradeship and 
        the will to help others because there is a very limited player-killing 
        aspect to it. The problem that generates with this society (as well as 
        other online societies), however, is that without any sort of retribution 
        or justice, there is a tendency to engage in disruptive or rude behavior. 
        Rude language/comments is something that the Guides and GMs will be dealing 
        with, but rude behavior with regards to monsters is something that is 
        in our realm. The rules for getting experience and being able to loot 
        a corpse are as follows: the person who does more than half the damage, 
        or the most damage if there are more than two individuals involved, gets 
        both the experience and the ability to loot the corpse. This is generally 
        fair, but becomes a problem under certain conditions. The most obvious 
        is when a monster is carrying a weapon of obvious value, so that killing 
        this monster equates to another 2 gold in the bank or a better weapon 
        to fight with. The general guideline is that the character who engages 
        it in battle first is the one with "rights" to the kill. They deal out 
        and take the damage, they deserve the goods. But it is fairly easy for 
        another character, most notably either a higher level character or a fighter 
        of the same level, to be able to deal more than half the damage even if 
        they come to the battle late, thereby gaining the exp and the loot. This 
        is rude, and with limited retribution, makes the game annoying for many. 
      <p>Just a little story to make you think if you wish to engage in this behavior 
        (and to give an idea to those who this behavior annoys). I was once fighting 
        a decaying skeleton with a weapon. I had done some damage, when a passing 
        fighter pounced on it to get the weapon. Being only a cleric, he managed 
        to do more damage and got the weapon, while I took the damage from the 
        combat. I berated him, but he cursed at me and ran off. A real class act. 
        So I tailed him. I waited until he engaged in battle with a monster that 
        was our level. He was going to win (he had the better weapon now), so 
        I began to heal the monster. Shortly he realized what was happening and 
        started to curse me out. I chuckled and continued to heal the monster. 
        Having not read my advice above, he decided to turn and run at the point 
        when he could only walk. He made it about three steps. [Note that this 
        doesn't work any more, but the point remains, had he been asking for help 
        or else he was going to die, I would have offered to contact his family 
        for him and ran off]
      <p>Now maybe you'll call this petty of me. It really had no effect on him 
        because he was a warrior below fourth level, all he had to do was run 
        from his spawn spot and pick up where he left off. But it made me feel 
        better, and I was pretty sure he would never steal a kill from me again... 
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>Being a newbie is a great deal of fun and, trust me, you'll be doing 
        it probably several times before you get it right and before you are settled 
        on a race/class that you really want to play for months. After a few times 
        you will be able to write the above without even thinking, but hopefully 
        this will carry you through those first few times.</p>
