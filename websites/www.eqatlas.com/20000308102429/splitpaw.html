      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      <p>Splitpaw used to be the home of the Splitpaw clan of gnolls. Now their 
        tribal home has been overrun by another more powerful clan of gnolls, 
        intent on their own political agenda, who use the Splitpaw clan any way 
        that they can. Splitpaw is the site where in gnoll legend, their god set 
        his foot upon the earth, and the surface markings are his footprint. Nobody 
        knows if this is true, but hunters in Southern Karana know the three talons 
        rising from the ground that mark the entrance to the lair. 
      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>angers </h3>
      <p>**Note that this dungeon has recently changed to be a greater then level 
        30 dungeon for the most part. Be aware of this as I have not yet updated 
        my description to reflect this.**
      <p>This is a dungeon for middle level characters, and the difficulty of 
        the dungeon scales relatively slowly from the entrance to the deeper parts 
        of the dungeon. The front entrance is occupied by 6th level gnolls, and 
        their level increases as you get further in, so that by the time you reach 
        the back of the first level, they are about 9th-10th level. 
      <p>The main danger in this dungeon, as in Blackburrow, is training. The 
        trains here are not huge Blackburrow trains, but little mini-trains where 
        the local gnolls decide to help out their buddies. Starting at the entrance, 
        almost all of the gnolls are with a partner at least, and so you have 
        to be able to take on two 6th level gnolls if you even want to walk in 
        the front door (which is why the level is listed starting at 8 above). 
        Gnolls, like all the half-sentient evil humanoids, have a tendency to 
        flee. Since they have a fair number of hit points and are really chickens, 
        they can make it quite far while fleeing, which makes it so that you have 
        more gnolls joining in than you care to have. If you are from a class 
        who can snare or root, or are in a group and have some leeway, then you 
        can start hunting at low-level. Otherwise, I'd avoid it until you hit 
        about 9th or 10th level. 
      <p>There is also a problem because in certain areas you will be attacking 
        gnolls thinking there is nobody nearby, and some gnoll will come running 
        around the corner. This is a &quot;feature&quot; of EQ where creatures 
        can tell you are attacking their buddy despite walls being between you 
        and them. This is of special importance at the small room on the other 
        side of the first bridge. There are usually a few gnolls here, and are 
        relatively easy to take (if you've made it this far, you can take them). 
        The danger is that around the corner and through a gate lies a Splitpaw 
        Guard, who will come running if he is close enough, and is a level or 
        two higher then these gnolls. Basically, if you hear the chains rattling, 
        turn and run. 
      <p>Also be aware that there are some high level shamans in the lower level, 
        as well as a high level necromancer at the back of the upper level. These 
        dudes are evil, especially the necro, cuz you don't know he's around (even 
        if you can track) until you open the door to the room he's in and his 
        pets come after you. Not fun... Also, there are rumors of a vengeful dark 
        elf named Nlxx who will come after any adventurers who take a certain 
        item from one of the shamans. 
      <p>The prison cells are dangerous if you step inside, because when the door 
        shuts you are without access to the lever, and you better hope someone 
        comes and helps you out. The main prison hall does not have this &quot;feature&quot; 
        however, so you can go through that door and escape easily. 
      <p>There aren't really any other unique dangers to Splitpaw. If you know 
        group monster management and how not to train, then you can get by well. 
        The only other problem with the zone is that it's a long walk from Qeynos 
        or Highhold Pass. If you can get bound in Arena, that would help. 
      <h3><font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>
      <p>Splitpaw is, by far, one of my favorite zones to hunt in. How many times 
        have I been in there and found more than ten other people hunting in there? 
        None. This makes the zone a dream come true. It is one of the least hunted 
        zones in the game, probably because it's far away from merchants and towns. 
        If you can handle the walk, however, this zone is for you. 
      <p>The gnolls are pretty easy to handle, given that you are careful.At higher 
        levels (like 11th or so) you have your run of almost the entire upper 
        level, which is nice. You can choose who to fight and when, and go sit 
        amongst the lower level gnolls to rest and meditate. This has also got 
        some great Giant Snake Fang hunting, as the snakes spawn fairly regularly 
        and are easy to get to. 
      <p>The above ground area of Splitpaw is also a nice area to hunt at a lower 
        level. The gnolls are fairly spread out and walk around (but not too much). 
        This is a little bit easier for you if you can't make it past the first 
        room of Splitpaw because of the gnoll grouping. 
      <p>Not much else to say about this zone. It's nice, uncontested, simple 
        hunting. My only wish is a closer merchant cuz you will get so bogged 
        down with goods that you wind up throwing out rusty weapons like crazy. 
        I found a bug where your money wraps back to zero once you hit 500 of 
        them by hunting in this zone. Sad... 
      <h3><font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
        <font size=+2>S</font>plitpaw</h3>
      <p>There is only one way to get to Splitpaw, and that is by entering Southern 
        Plains of Karana and travelling to the center. When you see the three 
        bloody claws sticking up from the earth, pass in between them. In what 
        would be the center of the paw, there is a small dark hole facing the 
        claws that is the entrance to Splitpaw. This is easy to miss if you've 
        never seen in before (and the first time I mapped Southern Karana in the 
        beta, I walked over this and never saw it), so keep your eyes peeled, 
        it's there somewhere.
