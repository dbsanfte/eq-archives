        Map last updated: 02/22/02</font></p>
      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      <p>This is the home city of the Kromzek, the storm giants. It is also something 
        of a trading post because the frost giants, who are more like nomads, 
        travel to here to make sales. 
      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>angers </h3>
      <p>This zone is generally unsafe even if you have never killed a giant, 
        and you need to be aware that there is a complex faction system within 
        the city. The Kromrif are the majority of the giants that you see, the 
        storm giants. You start out KoS to these guys. The next faction is the 
        Kromzek faction, which most of the vendors and quest givers are. These 
        are also mostly not KoS, but also not willing to sell or give you quests 
        right away. The third group is the King Tormax faction. The members of 
        this faction start out as KoS to absolutely everyone, and are difficult 
        to raise faction with. All of the guards of King Tormax fall under this 
        faction description. 
      <p>Also, although most of the giants can't see through invis, there are 
        some that do, so you need to travel safely. None of the giants on the 
        direct route from the Eastern Wastes to the Wakening Land can see invis, 
        so if you stumble across one that does, you've lost your way. There is 
        rarely a wandering giant along the safe route who can see through invis, 
        however.
      <p>In addition, Summon Corpse only works at the zone boundary at Eastern 
        Wastes here. Attempts to summon from elsewhere will fail. 
      <p>One should be careful when attempting to drag corpses of other people. 
        If you are dragging the body of anyone, you will be attacked even if you 
        are invisible and even if that person was not KOS to the giants. There 
        are a few areas (such as the Arena) where this might not be true, but 
        overall it is. You are safe dragging your own body, however, unless you 
        yourself are KOS to the giants here.
      <h3><font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>
      <p>There are many class-specific armor quests (similar to those in Thurgadin) 
        for those who have built up their faction here. 
      <p>You are able to be bound at the entrances to both of the adjacent zones.
      <h3><font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
        <font size=+2>K</font>ael <font size=+2>D</font>rakkal</h3>
      <p>In the Eastern Wastes you can reach the Kael by travelling to -6300, 
        +5000 and travelling inside.
      <p>The Wakening Land is located at loc -100, +3150.
