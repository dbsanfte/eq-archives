Whew, what an adventure. Here I am, in ShadowHaven looking for some tinkering stuff to make some really nice things (not that I have the skill of course). So I do a /who gnome.....hmmm. 3 gnomes in the zone, 2 are level 60, and one is lvl 13 (oh that is me!). After showing Bijinko where the merchant selling basic tinkering thingys, an idea pops into someone's head "hey, how about we try to go to Katta to get the rest of the stuff?" "sure"<P>I had some maps. At the time we made the trip, maps for Grimling Forest and Tenebrous were not on eqatlas. I made do with some maps from a place called mapfiend (lame, but better than nothing).<P>So we pass into Paludal Caverns, ok, Lots of reds yellows and blues (to a level 13 gnome). It is a twisty maze of passages, all alike. Or is it "a maze of twisty passages, all alike." Whatever, we made it through there ok. <P>Next into Hollowshade moor. Ahh. look up and see Norrath. What a pretty sight. Follow the road to Grimling Forest. Now this place I got a preview of at the fan faire, so I was not too worried. Everything here was red, but invisibility works ok. Although the road comes a little too close to Chateau Grimling.<P>Lah dee dah. Things are kinda nice so far, nice eye candy, a sense of adventure. Feeling good that we are making the trip.<P>Next stop Tenebrous Mountains. Do a /who.... hmmm. everyone is over level 49 except for some idiot gnome who is level 13....ooops thats me. shut up. After /ooc ing to ask some questions, the responses are that all the mobs see through invisibility. hmm. not a good sign. But then in Kunark, the drolvargs all see through invisibility, invis just reduces the aggro range dramatically (try it, the drolvargs /con scowling even when you are invis, but the aggro range is now melee range). Well, lets be brave, we are getting close.<P>Oops, there are 2 sonic wolves and they are spanking Bijinko (a level 60 cleric from the server's most powerful guild: if there is uber loot, she should have it). Let's see, cast fear.... get a message that they cannot be feared. Interesting. Of course everything was resisted being like 30 levels above me. OK. 1 dead, 1 rooted, lets run away. Looking at my map, we are about 1/3 there. Running between more sonic wolves and some bat thingies, back to the wall. Usually hugging the wall is a safe way to travel, or at least it works in Kithicor...<P>Ahh, there is a tunnel sort of entrance and 2 guards. Looks like the zone to Katta. Oops. They are Coterie Centurions, and they don't like me. Smack smack smack, dirt nap time. They cast something that did 200 damage, and I think it sucked manna too. Well. I think I got away from aggro range so that whoever dragged my body would not aggro the guards.<P>Along come Notoriously. woo-hoo. He finds my little body and drags it the rest of the way to Katta. Thanks! He shows us the gnome merchant and Bijinko presses combine furiously....<P>Final goodies (tinkered by Bijinko):<P>Jewelcraft thingamabob:<BR><A HREF="http://www.eliteall.com/images/Gemsettter.GIF" TARGET=_blank>http://www.eliteall.com/images/Gemsettter.GIF</A><P>Smithing whoseywhatsa:<BR><A HREF="http://www.eliteall.com/images/hammer.GIF" TARGET=_blank>http://www.eliteall.com/images/hammer.GIF</A><P>brewing doohickey:<BR><A HREF="http://www.eliteall.com/images/Fermenter.GIF" TARGET=_blank>http://www.eliteall.com/images/Fermenter.GIF</A><P>Thank you Bijinko!<P>Later when wandering around in Katta, there is a grave yard (turn left as you leave the building with the paladin, ranger, monk, cleric, rogue and warrior trainers). Wandering around there one triggers some undead mobs that hit for 80 (I guess that makes them level 25-30ish). It turns out from later research that there are 8 or 10 lore skins from these undead for a quest in the Magum Collegium (finger wiggler guilds in the building to the left as you face the BIG castle which also houses the bard, shaman and beastlord trainers). To get to the other floors in the mage area, click on the painting on the wall in back away from the door. 3 floors in that building. The trainers for all int caster guilds are in that building.<P>After yet another rez (thanks Bijinko), the GMs were announcing that the servers were coming down in an hour, so we called it a night.<P>What an adventure<P>-------------------------------------------<BR>And Bijinko wrote:<BR>Sometimes you don't need to have great loot, or be a part of a successful raid force to have fun in EQ. Last night was a prime example.<P>I found myself wandering thru Shadow Haven (lost, as usual) happily exploring the new town. For me, I try to visit every person in the zone, chat, barter, buy useless items, etc.<P>Okies so I was looking for tinkering stuff. And maybe an item to sell for 107k pp for a pony.  <P>I happened to meet a very very nice gnome. Smidgit was her name, a level 13 enchanter. After a brief conversation about tinkering in general, we decided to travel four zones away to check out the tinkerer in Katta Castellum. Neither one of us had been there, but Smidgit was armed with maps, information and a sense of direction. Both of us nervous, we headed out into the great unknown.<P>Travelling thru the first few zones were relatively easy - invis and run like hell. This tiny, young little gnome knew exactly where to go, so I happily followed.<P>Then we hit T Mountains (aka Vampireland).<P>Let me just say that this zone is now one of my favorites. I love feeling creeped out as soon as I enter a zone, the rush of adrenaline as you hear the sound of a howl from an unknown creature. Hearing /ooc warnings to turn back, that the danger of the place was frightening for me and my new friend, but we were commited and determined. We started off.<P>As we went thru the zone, things became eerily quiet. Where were these horrible mobs we had been warned about? Two little gnomes - armed only with courage (and invisibilty) - crossed over to head to the fabled city of Katta- home of one of the greatest tinkerers ever known.<P>From out of the darkness two huge, black, foul smelling, spittle slathering beasts attacked! These were not undead! These were just evil sonic wolves, hungry for a gnome snack! Spell after spell was cast, until finally the two wolves lay dead (or undead?) at our feet. We travelled onward, knowing that we were close to our destination.<P>It was then that we arrived on the doorstep of the vampire castle.<P>Nooo! This was not the fabled city of Katta Castellum! This was a fortress filled top to bottom with vampires, Frankenstein-like mobs that staggered to us. We were doomed from the start.<P>Smidgit fell silently, swarmed by the Frankenstein look-a-likes. I ran around, lost (as usual) trying to find an way to zone out. What did this cleric do, you ask? Why, I ran straight into the castle, aggroing EVERY SINGLE MOB THERE!  So imagine if you will, one gnome dead, trying to send directions in group chat, the other gnome scurrying around the zone, searching for any means of escape. I refused to gate, knowing that it would be hours before I could get back to help out my friend.<P>The zone to Katta Castellum appeared before my eyes. I staggered into the zone, my health less than a bub left.<P>A halfling sat at the zone in. Notoriously was his name, and he not only retreived Smidgit's corpse, but pleasantly described the flora and fauna of Vampireland. He also showed us where the tinkerers were in Katta.  Thank you Notoriuosly. You saved the day!<P>Smidgit had gathered a few of the components for some new recipes, and with a few words of encouragement, I combined the items in my toolbox and voila!!! Three new items!<P>Automated Hammer +5 smithing skill<BR>Fermentation Device +5 brewing skill<BR>Gem Setter +5 Jewelry Craft<P>We went the rest of the night exploring the city. Katta is a lovely place.<P>The moral of this story?<BR>You don't have to be high level to enjoy the game. You don't even have to be the same level to have fun in game. And sometimes, a character 47 levels lower than you can know a heck of a lot more than you.  <P>Thanks Smidgit!<P>-------------------------------------------<P>To our knowledge, these are the first of these 3 items to be tinkered on our server: Luclin.<P>This was originally posted on our server message board, but the post will get recycled off shortly (in about 3 weeks).<P><A HREF="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335general.showMessage?topicID=5534.topic" TARGET=_blank>http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335general.showMessage?topicID=5534.topic</A>
