Greetings, everyone. This is my first time posting on the boards, so bear with me, please… I can be a little long winded, sometimes. Also, thank you, Muse, for creating the Atlas: it has always been an invaluable resource.<BR>	Since I claimed that this was a post about astronomy in the title, I might as well meet that promise. In the past few months, we have been reading about EverQuest Online Adventures and EverQuest 2, and we have seen some screenshots from both of these games. The most recently released of these is the image of Darathar the Deceiver, a dragon who stands in front of the largest moon I have yet seen from the surface of Norrath. This picture was so striking that I decided it was time to compile measurements of all the astronomical objects visible in the three games and report them to all interested parties. Since the Atlas has a focus on investigation, I decided that it would be most effective to release this information here.<BR> But what information, you ask, and how did I get to it? Well, we cannot know how large an object in the sky really is just by how it looks. Parallax and Doppler shift are unusable, also… So I settled for taking angular measurements. I guessed, first of all, that all three 3D engines render frames that are ninety degrees wide – that is, one could rotate around and get four distinct images. EverQuest is not working properly on my computer, so I had to make this judgment by memory; it is just a scalar factor, though, so it should be relatively easy to correct if it is wrong. If it is accurate, though, it should be easy to take the diameter of one of the astronomical objects on a printed page and divide it by the width of the total image, then multiply by ninety degrees to find the angular diameter. This works well except when one of the objects is near the edge of the frame: then the engine distorts its circular shape into an ellipse. To compensate, I used the smallest cross-section as the diameter. Also, I had to hope that none of the images were cropped. All of them looked to have a four to three aspect ratio, so I just assumed that they were untouched. The results of these measurements are below. <BR> When reading them, make note that the years are presumed to be 2600 for Online Adventures, 3100 for EverQuest, and 3600 for EverQuest 2, because in my experience, the /time command gives a year varying between 3000 and 3200 in EverQuest. The whole set can be moved up and down in years, as long as EQOA is about five hundred years before EQ, and EQ2 about five hundred years after. Also, “Moon” refers to the moon seen nightly over Norrath – that is, the moon other than Luclin; “Sun” means the star illuminating Norrath, visible with the one-layer clouds graphics option.<P>Angular Diameter Chart<BR>Sun seen from Norrath, year 2600… 15.3 degrees<BR>Sun seen from Norrath, year 3100… 8.5 degrees<BR>Moon seen from Norrath, year 2600… 6.8 degrees<BR>Moon seen from Norrath, year 3100… 4.9 degrees<BR>Moon seen from Norrath, year 3600… 12.3 degrees<BR>Luclin seen from Norrath, year 3100…  5.3 degrees<BR>Norrath seen from Luclin, year 3100… 70.8 degrees<P>	This is interesting data in a variety of ways. It looks like the Sun and Norrath are separating with time, and the second moon is returning towards Norrath. This may just be part of a larger cycle in the planetary system, however. Remember some other interesting facts before we go on, though: the same face of the second moon always faces Norrath, and the second moon is always full. The same face of Norrath always faces Luclin, and Norrath is always full. The second moon is never visible from Luclin. Norrath rises and sets over Luclin, seemingly more slowly than the ninety minute day and night cycle present on Norrath. Luclin is normally visible only from the Plane of Air, but sometimes appears over Norrath. This is clearly an unusual system. Even stranger, though, is the relationship of sizes between Norrath and Luclin.<BR>	As we can see from the chart, Norrath’s angular diameter from Luclin is around (70.8/5.3) or 13.4 times that of Luclin’s diameter from Norrath (when it is visible from the surface). Therefore, since the distance between them is constant, Norrath is 13.4 times larger, linearly, than Luclin. Its volume is (13.4^3) that of Luclin, then; its mass, curiously, is only (13.4^2) or about 185 times that of Luclin (it is squared to cancel out the inverse square relationship of the gravitational force with distance), meaning that Luclin is 13.4 times denser than Norrath. Notice something odd about the above calculations? That is right, gravity has to be the same on both Norrath and Luclin; no one is jumping any higher on the moon. Moreover, it is roughly the same as on Earth, though it is difficult to take precise measurements… the gravitational constant (big G, remember) is also about the same as in our universe, since humans are in one piece and the sun of Norrath is shining. All of this is tough to reconcile with what I am about to discuss…<BR>	That is, Norrath and Luclin are very small. If the unit in the /loc command corresponds to about one foot, then the total area of the EverQuest world is about three to six hundred square miles. This represents one entire hemisphere of a planet, and part of its moon! But it is not seamless, you may object. That is a weak response, especially considering that something else it: the continent of Tunaria, later to become Antonica, in Online Adventures. It is only 360 square miles in size, but according to the globes outside Veeshan’s Peak and in the library of the Sleeper’s Tomb, this continent is supposed to occupy around a twelve of the total surface area of the planet. Bizarre? I told you so. Since both on these globes and on the maps provided in the game boxes, Antonica is about twice as long North-South as East-West, we establish the approximate equation 2(x^2)=360, and solve for an (x) of about 13.5 miles. The North-South length of Antonica runs roughly one-eighth the way around the globe, so the circumference of Norrath is 110 miles. Bought it yet? If you have, keep reading; if not, I probably cannot convince you. The radius of this sphere has to be around 17.5 miles, and also the radius of Luclin has to be about (17.5/13.4) or 1.3 miles. All of this is approximate, despite the pretension suggested by the number of significant digits. Anyway, we set this up in the formula for gravitational acceleration, set Luclin and Norrath’s acceleration equal to each other, cancel out the mass and gravitational constant components and cross-multiply, leaving us with (185)*(1.3^2)=(17.5)^2 or 312.65=306.25, which is pretty accurate for such approximate work. <BR>	Let me calculate the distance between Norrath and Luclin before I make a last observation. This distance is necessarily going to satisfy tan(70.8)=17.5/d and tan(5.3)=1.3/d, right?. But the former solves to 6.1 miles and the latter to 14 miles… so which is it? We could just average the two, but that would be wrong. Notice that the former value states a distance between the surface of Luclin and the center of Norrath, and the latter states a distance between the surface of Norrath and the center of Luclin. Indeed, the view of Norrath from Luclin implies that Luclin is inside the radius of Norrath, which clearly cannot be. With such inaccurate data and without a clear mind to work out this geometry further, the distance must remain indeterminate. A value of ten miles is intuitively satisfying to me, however.<BR>	Oh, what last observation was I going to make? That the astronomy of the EverQuest universe is extremely bizarre. It looks like we will be able to see constellations in Online Adventures and EverQuest 2, which should better let us correlate the relative properties of these bodies to fixed values. Perhaps firm information on them will come directly from Norrath in the manuals, or maybe in the roleplaying game to be released this summer. But realistically? There is no realism. Extremely dense bodies, strange tidal locks, inconceivably short days… all of this is better suited to the geometry of pulsars than habitable planets. But every day, tens of thousands of elves and dwarves and trolls live on these worlds without giving it a moment’s notice: it must work for them, in their world of magic. Maybe magic must be invoked to explain it. Ah, I see I have lost whatever magic I had when I started writing, but I do hope that it was informative… Keep exploring, everyone.

Erratum:<P>Unfortunately, the equations worked out earlier for the distance between Luclin and Norrath were not only wrong, but they were more congenial than the correct formulae. In reality, the distance (d) to Norrath from Luclin appears to satisfy tan(70.8/2)=18/(18+d), or d=18/tan(35.4)-18=7.3 miles; the distance (d) to Luclin from Norrath should solve tan(5.3/2)=1.3/(1.3+d), or d=1.3/tan(2.65)-1.3=26.8 miles. But the distance from the surface of one to the surface of the other should always be the same, and 26.8 does not equal 7.3. Someone at Verant clearly did not do their homework, or maybe I am just being too crude in my work. We can hope further developments in the games will lead to new perspectives literally becoming available, and the solution to our problem.<P>[ 04-30-2002: Message edited by: Reshokor Muiren ]<p>[ 04-30-2002: Message edited by: Reshokor Muiren ]

Resolution:<P>I realized this morning that my measurements of angular diameter are not correlated directly to linear diameter as I had supposed. This should have struck me, but living in a heavily forest area I guess I never though about the horizon -- that is exactly what the angular diameter really is, the angle going underneath from one horizon to another, just from a great height. The difference between the corrected results using this and my previous, flawed method are small when examining very distant, small objects, but not in this case. The error is most evident when looking at Norrath from Luclin. I can probably correct the calculations on my own, but if anyone else wants to try it, then go ahead. Good luck!

The simplest answer I could make is that someone has too much time on their hands... but I can contribute a few points.<P>There is no constant to measure the distance zone barriers represent.  In some zones one can "see" the other side.  In others (particularly ocean zones) there may be a greater distance involved.<P>Corresponding 1 loc to one foot seems to generate a VERY poor movement rate for characters.  Where did this number come from?  Why is it in imperial not metric?  Is the imperial measure fixed or, as with real world historical kingdoms, is it set based on the actual measurements of the current ruler?  In that case a foot in Oggok would be much larger than a foot in Ak'anon.<P>Certain areas shown on maps appear innacessible to PCs.  This includes moutain ranges, polar regions and certain forests.  How much land space do they occupy?<P>And, finally, is science the best system to use in a realm where magic is so prevalent?

That's quite a bit of impressive math.   <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"><P>All I can say is this: the people who designed the zones and appearances of the original game did a very poor job of lining up zones and making them roughly the same size compared to each other.  What this means is that if you try and line up zones that *should* fit together, like the loop of Kithicor Forest, Rivervale, Misty Thicket, Runnyeye, Gorge of King Xorbb, East Karana, and Highpass Hold, they wind up being all out of whack.  They did a bit better with Kunark (although you can't fit Cabilis in there with LOIO no matter what you do), and better with Velious, but I think they're back to their original ways in Luclin.<P>The point is that, although you can base very complex measurements on what you find, I can almost guarantee you that Verant did not work through these calculations prior to developing any of the art or zones.  You are bound to be frustrated and have things not work out right because of that.  I think you're giving them way too much credit, and I wouldn't have even expected them to work this stuff out, since it would have no bearing on the final game, and would only restrict what they did instead of opening up new areas to explore.<P>--------------------<P>Muse<BR>Bard and Cartographer

Exactly! I had tried lining up several of the newer zones together (thinking the mistakes of past zone alignment would have been fixed), specifically Paludal Caverns, Shar Vahl, Shadeweaver's Thicket and Hollowshade Moor... and guess what? Shar Vahl is about the third of the length it should be. ALSO, I judged the one foot equals one /loc measure on very rough guesswork; yes it is a poor estimation of character movement. I convinced myself it was reasonable looking at the spires, the bridge and the trees in North Karana with a high elf I was exploring with, but so many other experiences have undermined this assumption that I am not sure it is reasonable. It seems maybe intended, though: the developers are American, remember? The point about zone barriers is well taken. As a matter of fact, Velious and Antonica overlay the same space if zero movement is assumed over zone boundaries; then again teleporting because one steps over an line in the landscape is awfully unrealistic too. Since I used only Antonica to calculate the size of Norrath, and since Antonica is supposed to be seamless and 360 square miles in Online Adventures, the problem of unoccupied regions was "eliminated." But really, it is hard to explain them within the context of the original EverQuest: why should there be so many inaccessable plateaus and uncrossable mountains around the world? My method has been to use only the games themselves as canon material; many of the problems we encounter in the present analysis would probably dissolve if we looked instead at the associated literature and game fiction. Is it right to conduct a scientific analysis on a fictional world? Try the Star Wars Technical Commentaries (http://www.theforce.net/swtc), which is much, much more successful at explaining that universe than I am at this one. Ah... lastly the comment about to much time on my hands? That is sort of true now that my computer has trouble playing EverQuest, but still I can spend it pretty quickly doing other stuff and, at times, working on the things I am actually assigned. Anyway, I hope it was an interesting piece.<P>Reshokor Muiren,<BR>Dragon of the Outer Planes,<BR>Broodmate to Geshoren<P>Skorazu Hissanthi,<BR>Necromancer of the Thirty Fourth Scale,<BR>World of Torvonnilous
