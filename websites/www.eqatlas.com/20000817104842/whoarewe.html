        <p>I get many e-mails asking me what server I play on, what people I play, 
          what levels are my characters, etc. Therefore, to clear up the confusion, 
          I decided to add in a page devoted to my characters. Note that all of 
          my characters are on the Bristlebane server at present. That way you 
          can all see what characters I have and I don't have to respond to all 
          those e-mails anymore...</p>

              <p>Kithuriel is the consummate world explorer. At a young age he 
                headed from his homeland in the wood of Greater Faydark to explore 
                the world abroad. He alone is responsible for providing most of 
                the information on this page, and has mapped out Upper Guk, the 
                caves below Everfrost, Lavastorm Mountains, Rathe Mountains, and 
                many other out-of-the-way places in the game. He is an expert 
                at moving through areas that he probably shouldn't be in with 
                ease.</p>

              <p>Daias is similar in adventuring spirit to Kithuriel, but is much 
                less of a loner. Although he still spends much of his time by 
                himself, usually in the plains dedicated to his god, he can frequently 
                be seen with friends destroying the undead in Unrest or Mistmoore. 
                Blessed from an early age with equipment from a retiring master, 
                he has spent much of his money helping others and mastering blacksmithing, 
                a skill only halfling druids seem to have an interest in. Here 
                he is pictured with a friend of his, whom he sits with and chats 
                often while hunting.</p>
