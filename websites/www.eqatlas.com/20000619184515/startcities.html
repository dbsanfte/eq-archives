      <h1>Starting Cities in Norrath</h1>
      <p align="left">The following guide was put together to hopefully give you 
        an idea of which cities are good to start in, regardless of the consideration 
        of race and class and religion. I will admit that I haven't started in 
        all of these cities yet, and the ones I've never been in I will not even 
        comment on. It's also important to notice that a great deal of the negatives 
        were based on the beta and the development at that point. I would assume 
        that these will be corrected by release &lt;ahem&gt;.</p>
      <h2 align="center">Ak'Anon</h2>
      <p align="left">I haven't played here a great deal, but my accidental omission 
        of this page the first day allowed me to gather quite a bit of information 
        from emails about it... Thanks all!</p>
      <h3 align="left">Advantages</h3>
      <p align="left">It is possible (in fact suggested) that you reach 4th or 
        5th level within the city itself. This also has one of the handiest tough 
        critter zones on all of Faydwer, roughly 8th-10th level critters walking 
        all over the place. Plus, minotaur caves and axes... Need I say more?</p>
      <h3 align="left">Disadvantages</h3>
      <p align="left">City is somewhat confusing and slow to get around. Newbie 
        mines are a maze and it isn't easy to run for help if caught and in trouble. 
        I lost my first character by swimming up between a walkway and a building 
        and getting wedged there, and being unable to escape. Don't do that. Have 
        to leave your zone entirely to fight higher than 5th level critters.</p>
      <p align="left"></p>
      <h3 align="left">Rating: 7</h3>
      <h2 align="center">Erudin</h2>
      <p align="left">My very first beta character was started in Erudin, and 
        was quite successful, going on to become an 8th level magician named Kithuriel 
        before I moved on to greener pastures...</p>
      <h3 align="left">Advantages</h3>
      <p align="left">The newbie fighting area in front of Erudin is well-protected 
        from the tougher zones by a river and a bridge, so you can't get lost. 
        There are also people selling goods outside of the city who sell food 
        and other items (although they may now be converted to artisan goods). 
        This keeps you from having to zone to buy necessary items.</p>
      <h3 align="left">Disadvantages</h3>
      <p align="left">If you want to travel outside the zone it is a 10 minute 
        boat ride to Qeynos, plus all the zoning in between. Get used to begging 
        to be bound. There is a lag in creatures to fight from 3rd to 4th level. 
        The newbie area critters aren't abundant enough to make it worthwhile, 
        and across the bridge there are just too many killer skeletons roaming 
        around to make it worth all the times you'll die. Not many people play 
        here, it can get lonely...</p>
      <p align="left"></p>
      <h3 align="left">Rating: 7</h3>
      <h2 align="center"><a href="felwithe.html">Felwithe</a></h2>
      <p align="left">The city of the High Elves...</p>
      <h3 align="left">Advantages</h3>
      <p align="left">Any city on the island of Faydwer has access to the other 
        cities and their zones, which means if it's too crowded here, go elsewhere. 
        It also isn't far to recover your body in any of the other zones. By roaming 
        to the other zones, you can easily find creatures your level to battle. 
        There are also plenty of other adventurers to join with. And it's possible 
        to find the pelts needed to make patchwork for most of the island.</p>
      <h3 align="left">Disadvantages</h3>
      <p align="left">The newbie area is extremely crowded, due to Kelethin being 
        nearby and these two races being very popular. During the beginning of 
        Phase Four, it was unplayable here due to this. Greater Faydark itself 
        is very confusing, especially after you wander off the paths. Getting 
        lost in orc town is a problem. Access to Antonica is limited by the eternal 
        boat ride from Kaladim to Freeport.</p>
      <h3 align="left">Rating: 6</h3>
      <h2 align="center"><a href="freeport.html">Freeport</a></h2>
      <p align="left">I haven't played much in this city. I disliked it, but I've 
        received some feedback from some people who have played there a great 
        deal more than I, and I add it here. Thanks Kevin and Ron!!</p>
      <h3 align="left">Advantages</h3>
      <p align="left">Good newbie areas. Access to boat to Faydwer. Heading south 
        to the Desert of Ro leads you to an area well-populated with 1st-5th level 
        creatures. Easy access to food and drink, as well as the Commonlands nearby. 
        Lots of good creatures to group against. Many quests and merchants in 
        the area to keep it interesting. Also there are a good number of nearby 
        zones for higher level characters to adventure in, including the croc 
        killing grounds in the Oasis of Marr and Befallen, a tough dungeon for 
        levels 7-27. Best area to work on blacksmithing.</p>
      <h3 align="left">Disadvantages</h3>
      <p align="left">Occasional wandering madmen in Northern Ro are aggressive 
        and very tough, and guards won't save you from them.</p>
      <h3 align="left">Rating: 7</h3>
      <h2 align="center"><a href="grobb.html">Grobb</a></h2>
      <p align="left">The troll city attached to the swamps...</p>
      <h3 align="left">Advantages</h3>
      <p align="left">There is a great deal of newbie material in Innothule Swamp 
        and nearby Feerott. Of note, the frogloks are rich and often swathed in 
        magical cloth armor. I've never had richer characters than my troll.</p>
      <h3 align="left">Disadvantages</h3>
      <p align="left">You only have two zones to travel around in when starting 
        out. You can really get stir crazy after a while and want to move on. 
        Although there are zones nearby, the next 5th to 6th level zone is on 
        the other side of the Feerott, which is a very long walk if you get killed. 
        For that reason, many stay and kill frogloks for weeks, but that can get 
        tiresome. No bear pelts for patchwork. Very difficult to work on any trade 
        skills down here.</p>
      <h3 align="left">Rating: 7</h3>
      <h2 align="center"><a href="halas.html">Halas</a></h2>
      <p align="left">My most fun beta character was a Shaman from Halas, who 
        I acquired after some bug turned my 1st level Warrior into a 4th level 
        Shaman. I didn't complain. </p>
      <h3 align="left">Advantages</h3>
      <p align="left">This has one of the two best newbie areas for sheer number 
        of critters and wealth attainable. Just kill everything in sight. Also 
        has pelts available to make patchwork for yourself and your smaller neighbors 
        to the south. Once you map out the zone, it's pretty easy to find your 
        way around in and small enough to manage.</p>
      <h3 align="left">Disadvantages</h3>
      <p align="left">You are *way* in the boondocks. If you don't like your barbarian 
        friends, you had better get used to running through Blackburrow in the 
        pitch black to retrieve your body. Doesn't sound like fun? Also, some 
        of the &quot;low level&quot; quests involve some really dangerous areas.</p>
      <h3 align="left">Rating: 8</h3>
      <h2 align="center"><a href="kaladim.html">Kaladim</a></h2>
      <p align="left">The dwarven mine turned city...</p>
      <h3 align="left">Advantages</h3>
      <p align="left">Butcherblock Mountains have to be the best hunting grounds 
        in terms of having creatures available for every level imaginable. I didn't 
        leave there until 6th level, and then not because I had to. Easiest access 
        to the boat to Freeport.</p>
      <h3 align="left">Disadvantages</h3>
      <p align="left">City itself gets some taking used to walking around. Lots 
        of instances of some random huge monster walking by and swatting everyone 
        (&quot;where did that undead pawn come from?&quot;). Need to go elsewhere 
        to get pelts.</p>
      <h3 align="left">Rating: 7</h3>
      <h2 align="center"><a href="kelethin.html">Kelethin</a></h2>
      <p align="left">Tree city (makes me more scared of heights).</p>
      <h3 align="left">Advantages</h3>
      <p align="left">Very easy access to the city (no zoning needed). Once you 
        know your way around, easy to get to anywhere. Many small creatures to 
        kill, with the orcs providing the occasional exp boost. Provides a great 
        deal of goods if you know where to look.</p>
      <h3 align="left">Disadvantages</h3>
      <p align="left">Tends to be a very busy area, along with Felwithe. Also, 
        orcs tend to be overwhelming and group so much that even my high-level 
        characters would occasionally die from their swarms. Makes my palms sweat 
        cuz I'm scared of heights.</p>
      <h3 align="left">Rating: 6</h3>
      <h2 align="center"><a href="neriak.html">Neriak</a></h2>
      <p align="left">The dark elven city below...</p>
      <h3 align="left">Advantages</h3>
      <p align="left">A world unto itself, you could adventure down here for weeks 
        on end. Creatures are tough, but you advance quickly because of it.</p>
      <h3 align="left">Disadvantages</h3>
      <p align="left">City itself is very large and confusing. There is the highest 
        dweeb:character ratio of anyplace here playing, and the /shout'ing and 
        /ooc'ing could make a ten year old weep in pain. Difficult to leave and 
        find safe hunting grounds, because ogre and troll lands so far away. I 
        found a lot of kill-stealers when I played.</p>
      <h3 align="left">Rating: 4</h3>
      <h2 align="center"><a href="oggok.html">Oggok</a></h2>
      <p align="left">The ogres smelly city...</p>
      <h3 align="left">Advantages</h3>
      <p align="left">Very small city that is easy to get around in. Lots of good 
        regions between here and by Grobb for newbies on up, and you can smash 
        all day long. Not too many random wandering evil monsters.</p>
      <h3 align="left">Disadvantages</h3>
      <p align="left">No bear pelts for patchwork. The best mid-level hunting 
        around is probably frogloks, and they are almost two long zones away. 
        Easy to get lost in this large zone. Most creatures are aggressive around 
        here.</p>
      <h3 align="left">Rating: 6</h3>
      <h2 align="center"><a href="qeynos.html">Qeynos</a></h2>
      <p align="left">The other human port city... In the beta, this was probably 
        the best fleshed out city. It's also Muse's hometown.</p>
      <h3 align="left">Advantages</h3>
      <p align="left">Very well fleshed out city. Really gives you the feel of 
        being in a port town. Readily accessible to many different zones, including 
        the starting zone for rangers and druids and Blackburrow. You could adventure 
        for weeks and never leave the area. Easy access to a lot of other zones, 
        really feels like a melting pot with barbarians, Erudites, humans and 
        half-elves all around.</p>
      <h3 align="left">Disadvantages</h3>
      <p align="left">Newbie area can sometimes get very crowded, and the only 
        2nd level critters (fire beetles and Klikniks) are groupers.</p>
      <h3 align="left">Rating: 9</h3>
      <h2 align="center"><a href="rivervale.html">Rivervale</a></h2>
      <p align="left">This is the only city I have never once set foot in. Peter 
        e-mailed me to give me his take on it, thank you Peter!!</p>
      <h3 align="left">Advantages</h3>
      <p align="left"> Great newbie ground with lots of fire-beatles and spiderlings 
        everywhere. After that is easy cross a big wall to the harder creatures. 
        Lots of pelts from wolves here. Also good fishing with a pond inside the 
        town.</p>
      <h3 align="left">Disadvantages</h3>
      <p align="left">Isolated except from Freeport. Confusing city with a lot 
        of things looking the same. </p>
      <h3 align="left">Rating: 8</h3>
