</FONT><HR><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Well, it was announced yesterday that UO2 is no longer being produced. There's a <A HREF="http://www.avault.com/news/displaynews.asp?story=3212001-16245" TARGET=_blank>story</A> located on AVault about it. I personally think this is a sad, sad thing. I'll be the first to say that I wasn't a big fan of the original UO, but the new one looked like it was going to clear up all the issues I had with the original and be a really deep RPG that I thought I'd enjoy. I feel a sadness I feel when that much originality and creativity goes bye-bye, like when FASA closed their doors. There's one less world for us all to enjoy together...<P>------------------<BR>Muse<BR>Bard and Cartographer<p>[This message has been edited by Muse (edited 03-22-2001).]</FONT>

</FONT><HR><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Like the rest of you, when I heard that UO2 was cancelled, I was stunned. Shocked. Apalled. <P>But unfortunately, not surprised. <P>I had heard from folks at EA that EA.COM was due for layoffs this week (which we duly posted about)... and Origin was one of the largest links in that particular chain. Also the only one that actually had a hope of generating income, but logic never drives desperate accountants. <P>And UO2 or Ultima: Origin or Ultima: Nexus or Ultima: Woo or whatever it was called this week (the inability to even think up a simple name for the game betrayed the utter incompetence Origin's upper management could seemingly never exhaust their supply of), after years of development, was supposedly only weeks away from beta, and months away from release. Some rumors had it that the game itself was an unplayable mess; others insist that it was ready to go and as revolutionary as was promised. We'll never know, now. <P>Because EA, in their again infinite supply of wisdom, decided that aborting one MMOG in the womb, and handing OSI's largest competitor a pre-built development team, wasn't enough insanity for one fiscal year. No, in addition, it was decided that it was time to flush years of development, toil and sweat into the toilet. Because, you know, Origin might not be able to run more than one game at a time. And UO is making money at the moment. Making money in a dot.com is a rare thing these days. <P>So OSI once again turns to Ultima Online, as the standard bringer and now apparently the only project in their shop (an anonymous source described OSI's place in the EA.COM hiearchy as "the server farm, nothing else"). <P>Too bad they don't have a clue what to do with that, either. <P>Third Dawn is a technically amazing feat of engineering. It's on a par with taking your old COBOL systems and teaching them to store dates as 4 digits instead of 2. But is it something that will compete with the latest and greatest from Verant, Turbine, and elsewhere? <P>Of course not. <P>I say this with a great deal of sadness, not because I personally like UO (I haven't played it seriously in over a year now) but because it is the greatest example of what might have been. It betrays so much promise it's almost criminal. UO could be the greatest MMOG out, of ANY of them. It would be so goddamned easy. All it would take is courage, and trust, and the willingness to take risks. <P>Leave aside the unbalanced PvP system, or the lag-happy networking code, or the omnipresent bugs, or even the recent hell-with-it-just-make-everything-a-number attempt at localization. Those are all technical issues. Those can all be fixed. What can't be fixed is a lack of vision. <P>OSI's finest hour was the Battle of Trinsic. And it also was its greatest failure. <P>In one brief moment, as the storytellers at Origin did their best to fling challenges great and small at the UO playerbase, people felt like they mattered. That the world actually responded to what they were doing, that they were no longer "just in a game" but in a world, a world that could possibly be shaped by their actions. <P>In that moment, UO held the greatest possibility of transcenedence -- the ability to grow beyond its designers, that the fate of the game - the world - would from that point on not be in the hands of the caretakers, but the inhabitants. <P>But it was an illusion. The story was pre-written, and badly at that. It rapidly became obvious that OSI had no idea how to finish what they began, and as the events around Trinsic grew beyond their control, the story line just ....stopped. All of a sudden, it was time for UO:Renaissance (the fact that the battle of Trinsic was supposed to explain the events of UO:R was convienently forgotten) and the players didn't matter. There was a game to ship, damn it. <P>It is no coincidence that the one part of UO:R that took the longest to actually make it into the game was also the one part that involved trusting the players to shape their own world. And as the faction system wound through developer after developer at the revolving door that was Origin, the ability of players to change their world was surgically removed, until the faction system itself was no longer a venue for storytelling, or a means for "PvP that mattered" (sadly, Origin's words, not mine) but simply, in one last, final joke on the players, a way to dye your stuff purple. <P>There hasn't been a new American server since shortly after UO launched (not counting Siege Perilous, and judging from its exclusion from most of UO3D, it really doesn't count). There hasn't been a major story-driven event in UO in months. While EQ launched two full CDs worth of expansions and AC delivered downloadable updated content on a monthly basis, UO managed to deliver one dungeon through creative hacking. <P>Supposedly, UO3D will change this. <P>Supposedly, we were supposed to have a new magic system called "Necromancy." <P>Supposedly, we were supposed to have a revamped alchemy system. <P>Supposedly, we were supposed to have auctions for player property (and no, eBay does not count). <P>Supposedly, we were supposed to have a compelling faction system. Supposedly, we were supposed to have a working player economy. Supposedly, we were supposed to have an environment free of exploits and confused volunteers and uncaring overworked gamemasters. Supposedly. Supposedly. Supposedly. <P>Perhaps, as the localization changes that were rammed down the complaining playerbase's throat suggest, Origin simply doesn't care about the American market any more. We whine. We rant. We are unappreciative of all the hard work that goes into keeping a four year old collection of spaghetti code up and running. We're a pack of ungrateful bastards. But, you know, Origin's awful big in Japan. They probably think Richard Garriott still works there. <P>We know better.<BR></FONT>

</FONT><HR><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I'm coming from the same place--I've been playing UO for over a year, and this was the last dissapointment I could take.  I was practically giddy over UO2 when I heard it was a few weeks from beta.  I needed something new--after a year of UO I had pretty much done/seen it all.  Just started up EQ, and I must say the customer support and updates and constant "newness" added to the game every week just astounded me.

</FONT><HR><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Very well put Malefic, I myself was a UO player for the first 2 yrs of it's existence. Way back when it was first released from beta, the very first week it was out i bought the game. I rushed home opened the box, installed the game, started my account, and started dieing Immediately. And loved every hour I played for weeks, sometimes up all night. Then i started slowly seeing the problems with the game and the lack of support. But i continued to play logging thousands of hours, building my characters and buying houses. (Back when you could still find land to put them) I kept with the game and dreaming of what it could become and going on the promises of the developers. Slowly and surely i was realizing that i was being miss led like the other 200,000 other players. With the promises of a better world, and the new things they were going to bring to the game. So i was playing less and less, till all I was doing was logging in to "refresh" my houses, ships and check my Dragons and horses at the stables. <BR>So I applied to be a Beta tester with EQ, I think it was the second or third faze of testing i can't remember now. But much to my surprise i got my disk in the mail and I was officially a beta tester for EQ! I played the game for maybe 2 weeks, along with logging into UO occasionally. And it just wasn't there for me playing EQ, I missed the depth of UO, I missed riding my horse with my best armour on, with my Great Wyrms and Dragons in tow and watching the newbies druel, sailing my ship for treasures, and being this powerful tank mage with a title of Glorious Lord. EQ was this hollow "first person shooter" just ok type game. Compared to UO, and the possibilities that the game had, I quit EQ and started back with UO again.<BR>Well to make a even longer story short i had my UO account on EBay 3 months later. Totaly and completely unhappy with the promises that Origin had made and never kept, the almost unplayable game they had created, and the total lack of support i was finaly without a Online RPG. After 2 yrs of my time and many many foul words thrown at the game because i died at the feet of some lame monster that i easliy could have taken out in 2 spells or a few hacks of my magic sword, because my game crashed, and some little newbie came along and looted all my stuff that was it! I was done forever, my hard earned account was in the hands of some complete stranger that i heard from freinds just bought it to make a profit on.<BR>Then came along the stories of a new UO. One that was gonna make everything allright again. A game that was gonna be the game that UO was supposed to be and more. I was excited again about playing, even though it was gonna be another Origin product, I thought maybe they had changed there ways and were gonna bring a great game to the masses. Now i hear like the rest of us that it is never gonna happen. They have let me down again, for the last time. <BR>But in recent months i bought EQ Ruins of Kunark for a discounted price. Thinking I'll give it another chance, even if it's just out of sheer winter boredom. Well much to my surprise i find the game refreshing and fun. I like the idea if i die someone isn't gonna take my loot. Or the sheer terror of this group of Pk's running into the dungeon and killing me and my horse and running off with 2 hours of hard earned cash and prizes i accumulated. I also like the idea of new and fresh things introduced the game. I like that most people are nice and helpfull and there not cursing every other word. I like the fast paced nature of the game. I like the simplicity and the streamlined effect of the game, the word i used 2 yrs ago to describe it was hollow. It's not hollow it's fun, alot of fun. I like this game. Man im on Evercrack, and i need my dose every day!<BR>And thats my story, and probably alot of others as well.</FONT>

</FONT><HR><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Its amazing how similiar your stories sound to my own.<P>I started playing UO in beta, but I chose to leave a year ago.  I became tired of the constant changes with no warning, of the lack of in-game support.  And though I missed my friends (I did give them all my houses, money, etc), I have found EQ to be refreshing.  If I was to participate in PvP, I may do so on one of the several servers.  But if I want to role play, or just adventure knowing that I'm at least safe from death at another player's hands should I choose, I can do so.<P>I find the EQ players much more into roleplaying, friendlier, and more apt to help you when you need it.  Must the graphics in EQ are outstanding.. <P>Plus, although I enjoyed the houses, pets, and whatnot, I did become very tired of having to "refresh" them.. or to pay someone to if I went on vacation... <P>Llua Musical<BR>Bard and Adventuress</FONT>
