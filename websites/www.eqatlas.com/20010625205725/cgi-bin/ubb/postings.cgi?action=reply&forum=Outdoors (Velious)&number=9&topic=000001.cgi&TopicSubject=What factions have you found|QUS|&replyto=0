I have found that Wurms in TGD are without faction.  Are there other mobs out there that are either no-faction, or only faction with themselves and start out KOS?

Also, what have you found of the Giants, their factions, and getting through their city to other places.

I think they also have more quests than the giant city.<P>When you arrive in Vellious, you start with Threatening faction with the giants:<P>Kromrif<BR>Krom...something<P>Those are frost and storm giants.  You start out apprehensive with the dwarves.<P>Coldain<P>And I believe, though no confirmed, you start apprehensive with the dragons.<P>Council of Claw<P>The above post for having to choose what faction you want is right on the money.  My suggestion is that you start off by killing giants and getting good faction with both the Coldain and the Council of Claw.  Thurgadin will serve you well as a quest and supply post.  This also keeps the dwarves off your back while hunting other things.<P>Later on, however, it would be good to have some giant faction unless you are fast and invis capable to pass through Kael, the giant city.  It is the only way to get to the really high level zones in Vellious.<P>Hope that helped.<P>Kindring GoldenBlade<BR>40th Paladin of Tunare<BR>Sacrament, Povar</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Mindert</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">You do not start out at apprenhisive to everyone. Your Race and Religon have MUCH to do with your faction. I have seen several ppl start out at Indifferent to the Giants. Elves seem to be Apprenhesive to the Dragons while I (Human) was KOS to them.<P>The Giant city is the HUB of the continent and being able to get through there would be benificial however I am told that you cannot have both Giant and Dragon faction and In order to get past Wakening land you have to go through the Dragons. Just a Thought. A good number of the Giants are Green to me at 44 while I only saw the first 3 Dragon rooms they were all Blue or higher. I think that having Dragons as friends might be a good idea.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Gael</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">As a Wood Elf Druid (worshipping Tunare) entering Velious for the first time, the Frost Giants in Iceclad Ocean view me threateningly. I suspect it's because both me and Kindring both worship Tunare, whom the Giants are, in a sense, at war with. Paladins and Druids of Karana may be fine with the Giants.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Xiexa</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Well giant faction is def important since you can not reach the other zones in Velious except thru the giant city. If you are a class that can self invis its possible to stop in safe areas and recast but for those class's with no self invis its a pretty scary run make sure you have a sow and that you are following someone who knows the route well. I have run across at least one giant who can see invis (killed me to)As to the dragons I have gone thru the Wakening Lands to Skyshrine without aggroing the dragon (he hangs on the south east side of the zone and has a huge aggro range and of course sees invis. If i had my pick I would prefer good giant faction. (I'm currently working on improveing it)</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Dahnlor</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">First, some basics:<P>Thurgadin is the most accessible and easily best-equipped city that I've visited in Velious.  There's more in Thurgadin than in most starting towns.  Armor quests are also on the basic Coldain faction, which everyone starts non-KOS to.  Royalty faction is also not KOS to most.<BR>Normal=Coldain<BR>Royalty=DainFrostreaverIV<P>Kael Drakkal is the only way to get from Eastern Wastes to Wakening Lands by foot.  I've heard of many quests, but my understanding is that the NPC vendor selection is rather lacking.  Kromrif and Kromzek giants are KOS to all but Rallos Zek worshippers, and the king is KOS to all.  I haven't heard of any armor quests here yet.<BR>Normal=Kromrif<BR>Normal=Kromzek<BR>Royalty=KingTormax<P>Skyshrine is the way to get from Wakening Lands to Cobalt Scar by foot.  I have found a bank and a muffin vendor here, no other merchants I've found.  Armor quests require Yelinak faction, who starts even more KOS than the rest of the dragonkind here.<BR>Normal=ClawsOfVeeshan<BR>Royalty=Yelinak<P>Raising normal factions is as simple as killing their enemies.  Killing Kromrif giants raises both Coldain and CoV faction, killing Coldain raises both Kromrif and Kromzek, killing Kromzek only raises CoV, and killing dragons raises only Kromzek.<P>Raising royalty factions appears to only be possible by completing quests, or by killing the few (and extremely tough) creatures on opposing royalty faction.<P>From what I've seen, the way to be liked in the most places as possible is to kill giants.  You will have full access to the very well-equipped town of Thurgadin, and have safe passage through Skyshrine.  An added bonus to good CoV faction is being able to use the dragon portals in Wakening Land and Cobalt Scar, both of which are surrounded by dragons.  Anyone who knows about Wuoshi knows what I'm talking about.  The only disadvantage to this is that you need to be invisible to pass through Kael between East Wastes and Wakening.<P>Being a giant-killer, I can only guess at some of the advantages of getting in good with the giants.  Safe passage through Kael is one, though it is at the cost of safe passage through Skyshrine.  One thing I understand is that the dragons and coldain drop better armor in general, while in comparison giants don't seem to drop much very often.  Probably the best advantage of positive Giant factions is to give more hunting options...they are essentially at war with everyone else anyway.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Thesi</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I went through and read what people have said about this topic.  Entering into Velious later than that of most people I had noticed that most people were killing giants.  Being a druid I am used to being KOS in many different zones so I decided to start off being KOS to the Coldain and all factions related to being warm with the giants.  This has proven to be very useful and brings a side of the game that I like to play.  There is hardly any competition (except from those in my guild) for Mobs to hunt.  While everyone is killing giants or orcs, I focus my attention on the Coldain.  I originally made my decision based off of the quests listed on a web site and yes there are the epic armor quests in Kael for every class.  All 3 of the different areas for the armor is simular and serve their purpose.  Basically what it comes down to is what class you are and the level of difficulty you want out of the game.  Just my thoughts from the opposing team.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Fumeden</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Yes you CAN have good giant and Coldain faction. There are people in my guild that do.  If you you are not KOS to Coldain, then dont kill them.  If you need to raise Giant faction, kill in Skyshrine. <P>------------------<BR>--Perdurabo<BR>--Anima Pura Sit</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
