I was looking for a good on-line game and since EQ is the grandaddy of them all I thought I would try it since 400,000 people couldn't be wrong.  Boy, was I and the 400,000 wrong.  In the 3 days I've played I've been disconnected DOZENS of times (the only time I've been able to exit the system correctly back to Windows is when I tried to connect and it wouldn't let me connect, otherwise it has locked the system and normally I have to reboot (an no, I was not impatient, I let it sit for half an hour once and thru a NFL game another time)), you have to go thru  8 screens and manually interact with 5 to get in, long delays when you can get in (I haven't been able to get in at all today due to server congestion), the attack action is pretty lame and hard to see if you're in or out of it, not a whole lot of room on the characters and it takes time to move between screens, very limited documentation (most of the commands I've used have come from internet sites like this one), there's no way to know where you're at unless you stay near landmarks (makes my ranger's tracking skill pretty worthless), you don't even know which direction you're facing (yes, I've hot keyed the sense heading button and you can EVENTUALLY find out, but when you have an orc centurion on your tail that's not so great &lt;grin&gt; ), you randomly appear someplace after you die (last night I started showing up near a lift I hadn't been to for 5 reincarnations), and you lose everything if you die.<P>Currently, I don't think the game is worth playing (Asheron's Call is 30 times the game this is and I dislike Microsoft).  They could make a few changes that would, in my opinion, at least make the game playable.<BR>1) Shorten the log in process, do we really have to agree to the terms every time and I could mention some other spots they could consolidate a couple of steps.<BR>2) When your character dies only have them lose a couple of their better items.  That way if they can't get to their body (like now when the servers won't let you in, or you need to go to work, etc.) they don't lose everything and they have some equipment to try to equip themselves with to go after their body.  The bank does not work in Kelethin - by the time you reset the computer, get up the lift, run the platforms to find the bank and get your equipment my half hour is up.<BR>3) Allow location coordinates, so at least people have some idea where they are at.<BR>4) Let people know where they are going to return when they die.  At Kelethin, maybe at the lifts.  It was very disconcerting to end up on the other side of Kelethin when I hadn't been there, or been reincarnated there for quite a while.<BR>5) Make it easier to bounce between screens and to know when you are being attacked.  Kind of tough when you're looking at your inventory and the only way you know something is whacking on you is by your character jerking in the window since the target window was covered up (life bar was also going down, but I was concentrating on moving wasp wings around to pick up the orc hatchet).<BR>6) Clean up the bugs.  I can't believe I couldn't exit the dumb game even when I went through the whole camp process and it timed me down.<BR>7) Getting faster, more, or more reliable servers would also be nice.

First which version of the game did you buy... the nice little DVD sized box that contains no manuel, or the one thats full size and has the real manuel. (not that the manuel is all that useful, minus the city maps occasionaly)<P>So anyway there is plenty of documentation with the game, you are just being to ignorant to use it. check the little file called "eqmanuelsupplement.txt" or .doc in your EQ directory. And then check the manuel on your CD if you have the little dvd sized box version.<P>Second, of course it takes time to switch screens, I would love you to show me a game that doesn't take time to switch screens.<P>You seriosuly think 5 screens is to much to interact with? You must be one lazy person.. lets see hit the "yes" button, then the main screen where you hit "play online" then you enter your name and pword and hit connect, then you get a list of servers, you pick your server, then you get a list of your characters, pick your character, then your in the game.  Thats REALLY REALLY hard work isn't it?<P>And you don't show up randomaly at places... your binded to a certain spot and every time you die you show up at that spot...<P>yes sense heading is a "skill" which means you have to "train" in that "skill" to get it working a lot of the time, so when your walking around hit the "sense heading" button. and eventualy it will start working more than 50% of the time. So just suck it up and use it to get it better.<P>I have been disconnected twice, in 3 weeks. Check your internet connection, if you say AOL then it's more likly it is AOL's fault than it is EQs.<P>As for your things to improve<BR>1) sure it could be shorter, but it doesn't need to be. See they want their menus to look nice, and thats fine with me.<BR>2) Hey geuss what, after level 5 you get a whole 5 hours of game time, or a WEEK of offline time to get your corpse. Read the "manuel" before you complain about lack of documentation<BR>3)hey guess what, there are location cooradinates. type in /loc  its right there in the /help in game and in the manuel supplement on your hard drive. once again lack of documentation my arse.<BR>4)Hey geuss what you start off with a pre detrimened bind spot, and after that you can go choose your own by having someone bind to it. But it most deffinatly does not change unless you made the change.<BR>5)hit the magical "F10" key, will switch your mode to a full screen version where everything is "gasp" transparent.<BR>6)hey guess what you hit "sit" then "camp" 30 seconds pass. then several more pass while it finishes logging you out. I for one have NEVER had a problem logging out of the game.<BR>7) So screen after screen of servers isn't enough for you? EXTERMLY low lag isn't enough you you? I have a 56k that will only connect at 42k and I play the game with no lag, ever. <P>Several of your complaints stem from the "lack of documentation" It looks like you didn't ever bother reading any of the documentation to discover the rest of it. So quite complaining when you havn't even read the documenation it comes with.<P>Also what are the specs of your computer, and what type of connection. (14k, 28k, 56k, 128k, DSL, Cable)<p>[This message has been edited by salvondax (edited 11-07-2001).]

Thanks for the info.  I find it interesting that your "good documentation" is from text files or a help command that's not listed in the manual (I went through it page by page to make sure I had not missed it).  Seems to me like the manual is where the documentation should be located.<P>As for you question about what kind of game I purchased and my system set up, well I bought the trilogy.  That's where I found EQ Atlas, they use Muse's maps in their manual.  As for my system, it is a pretty loaded 1 ghz machine, although I am only using a 56k modem.<P>I'm glad the game works so well for you, but like I said, I waited for half an hour and 3.5 hours for it to log me out through the camp process (it won't let you camp without sitting, but thanks for the advice).  It timed down to the 5 seconds (I don't know if you get a zero second message or not) so it acted like it was working.  As for the bind, I kind of assumed that you would return to whereever it said the character was saved.  However, like I said, I was at the orc lift running north to get my body and the orcs kept killing me.  Therefore, my bind spot should be between the orc lift where I reincarnated and the orc camp to the north.  Instead, once it ended up being at the south end of the town in the newby area I had spent some time in hours earlier.  It remained there until I gave up on getting my body back.  Seemed pretty random to me.<P>As for opening screens, I don't care about the screens they bounce you through, but I do not like to click a bunch of buttons for absolutely no reason, power to you if you do.  I could get you playing in 2 manual interventions instead of 5 and I think that would be a lot easier on everyone.  When you first go into the game it could eventually take you to the server page for the first intervention.  You would pick your server to connect to (you'd have to modify the screen to allow you to go to your account, etc. if they did not want to connect).  Then you just have to pick your character for the last manual intervention.  It really doesn't seem necessary to me to tell the game you want to play an on-line game on-line, nor does it seem necessary to agree to the terms after the first time, unless they modify them (does anyone check?), and the connect click could easily be tied to picking the server.<P>As for bouncing between screens, there is going to be some delay granted, but don't cover over vital information.  Seems like something that should have been caught in testing.<P>I did not mean to trash your game.  I've just been playing computer games for over 20 years and this has been a real dog for me.  I was just curious what good anyone saw in it.  Sounds like maybe I just got a bad copy.  I really appreciate your /loc command, maybe that will help some.  Isn't DOS grand.<P>BTW, if you like this game, you really ought to try Asheron's Call.  I played it for 3-4 months and it is much easier and much more varied than EQ.  I'd still be playing it if they hadn't had a server problem which wiped out one of my characters and no one seemed to be able to do anything about it and of course they are Microsoft.

lol bad copy... I had trouble getting trilogy to work. First one I got had the main cd scratched down to the data. After I got a new set of cds the game seemed to think it could only install to c:\windows and I had to go tweak the registry and some other things to let me install it, after that it wouldn't finish installing so I had to copy both Trilogy cds to my hard drive and install off that.<P>Which might explain why I was willing to sit through the first 5 levels of the game.<P>In any case, everytime you patch the game it says "check the eqmanuelsupplement for the latest information" or something very similar. And sicne they do update the game so often the documentation can't be in the manuel is essentialy obsolete right now.<P>I know it's possible to easily cut down on the amount of screens but why? they are mainly instantenous on my system 'cept the loading screens of course. <P>Bind points are always the same unless you change it. You normaly always appear somewhere in the local newbie zone. Such as in Kunark, My monk started the game right next to my guild. But my bind point is in the Field of Bone, the local newbie area, and I have always started in the exact same spot.<P>Maybe you should try a different server, if you'd like I'd be more than willing to help you through the first few levels, or answer any questions, I'm normaly on as salvondax or salvondos. But I play weekends mainly. Of course you would have to start a new character on Cazic-Thule.<P>hey, don't pick on microsoft. They actualy managed to slove my problem with Crimson skies. It took sony a week to give me a solution that would let me install EQ, of course I still had to copy it to my hdrive, which they never said I would have to do...<BR>

I am by no means an experienced player, but if you are trying to connect via AOL, stick to AOL 6.0 for now. I tried installing AOL 7.0 and could not login to save my life. I removed 7.0 and reinstalled 6.0 and everything was fine. This may have been fixed by now, but I haven't bothered.

Ok, my 2cp.  You say you can't log out of EQ correctly?  Most likely your machine.  My parent's machine did that all the time, always had to reboot and it was a pain in the arse.  I got my own machine and never had a single problem logging out.  Also, update any and all sound/video card drivers.  I was having a problem on my machine about a couple months ago, had just installed DX 8.0a and I'd be doing just about anything, from checking my email to playing EQ and the app I was using would just disappear on me, mainly happened to me while playing EQ, I would be killin' something in DL and all of a sudden I hear my machine processing, the screen froze for a second, then I was back at the desktop like I had just booted up my machine, no trace of me ever even starting up an app.  After complaining for about 2 weeks that EQ had gone to crap, I decided to do my routine check for new hardware drivers and found new drivers on my card's website.  After installing them, EQ has not once done that to me again, nothing else has either.  So I suggest doing that, it may be the problem, or at least a step in solving the problem =)<P>Falklian Holydawn, 45 paladin of the Lady Marr

<P>If you decided to pick up and play EQ during this time of the expansion, I feel for you.  It has been trying times for all of us who know and love the game, and I can only imagine the frustration for someone just trying to get started.  I do need to point out that it doesnt usually suck that bad, but has taken suckage to a new level in the last week or so, but things are looking up daily, with zone times/loading times/server congestion lighting up greatly.<P>This game is heavy into cryptic lore ridden rites of passage, and it looks like you had the glory of finding them right off the bat.<P>Most of the information that it appears that you are looking for is found outside of the given doc's.  (Although the manuals are a darn good start, and they were later moves to a doc file, so they could sell the game at a lower price ie. all 2 expansions and the original game in one box)  Most of the info is found out in the player base.  This is a living community, and thrives off the interaction of players.<P>Muse runs a great board, with lots of incredible info in newbie guides.  Take a look at it, it might be of some use.  Also the other players while you are on line are a great referance point.  Ask around for what you need.  We have all been there standing naked in Kelthin, wondering why they moved the bank... again.<P>One of the neatest thing about this game, is that it truely is an onion, with many layers to cut into.  Some smell mind you, but they help you make a good soup.<P>In the same breath, if you prefer to play something else with your time, then by all means, go do so :)<P>Life is too short to play silly games.<P>Be safe in your travels, and dont hesitate to ask directions.<P>Angustus<BR>Warlord of Terris-Thule

 <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2">Originally posted by WandererKC:<BR><B>I was looking for a good on-line game and since EQ is the grandaddy of them all I thought I would try it since 400,000 people couldn't be wrong.  Boy, was I and the 400,000 wrong.  In the 3 days I've played I've been disconnected DOZENS of times (the only time I've been able to exit the system correctly back to Windows is when I tried to connect and it wouldn't let me connect, otherwise it has locked the system and normally I have to reboot (an no, I was not impatient, I let it sit for half an hour once and thru a NFL game another time)), you have to go thru  8 screens and manually interact with 5 to get in, long delays when you can get in (I haven't been able to get in at all today due to server congestion), the attack action is pretty lame and hard to see if you're in or out of it, not a whole lot of room on the characters and it takes time to move between screens, very limited documentation (most of the commands I've used have come from internet sites like this one), there's no way to know where you're at unless you stay near landmarks (makes my ranger's tracking skill pretty worthless), you don't even know which direction you're facing (yes, I've hot keyed the sense heading button and you can EVENTUALLY find out, but when you have an orc centurion on your tail that's not so great &lt;grin&gt; ), you randomly appear someplace after you die (last night I started showing up near a lift I hadn't been to for 5 reincarnations), and you lose everything if you die.<P>Currently, I don't think the game is worth playing (Asheron's Call is 30 times the game this is and I dislike Microsoft).  They could make a few changes that would, in my opinion, at least make the game playable.<BR>1) Shorten the log in process, do we really have to agree to the terms every time and I could mention some other spots they could consolidate a couple of steps.<BR>2) When your character dies only have them lose a couple of their better items.  That way if they can't get to their body (like now when the servers won't let you in, or you need to go to work, etc.) they don't lose everything and they have some equipment to try to equip themselves with to go after their body.  The bank does not work in Kelethin - by the time you reset the computer, get up the lift, run the platforms to find the bank and get your equipment my half hour is up.<BR>3) Allow location coordinates, so at least people have some idea where they are at.<BR>4) Let people know where they are going to return when they die.  At Kelethin, maybe at the lifts.  It was very disconcerting to end up on the other side of Kelethin when I hadn't been there, or been reincarnated there for quite a while.<BR>5) Make it easier to bounce between screens and to know when you are being attacked.  Kind of tough when you're looking at your inventory and the only way you know something is whacking on you is by your character jerking in the window since the target window was covered up (life bar was also going down, but I was concentrating on moving wasp wings around to pick up the orc hatchet).<BR>6) Clean up the bugs.  I can't believe I couldn't exit the dumb game even when I went through the whole camp process and it timed me down.<BR>7) Getting faster, more, or more reliable servers would also be nice.</B></font><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>I have the game installed. Have had it for a year nearly with all the xpansions as soon as they have become available. I am now 43rd level. I have the graphics maxed out and i get no slow down at all. I have never experianced any bugs and can hoinestly say i have had no problems at all.<P>Dont count me as one of the 400,000.

dont loose heart, keep playing. I dont think you'll regret it. <P>I remember my first few hours in EQ, i had no type of documentation or anything to go on so i was basically just pressing buttons. <P>I remember i was a ranger who started in surefall glade, i spawned next to an npc and started typing randomly thinking it was a real player. (took me a while to figure out the difference) then got mad when she wouldnt talk to me. I remember sitting by the millers outside SFG and trying to talk to them too, then eventually attacking them mutiple times. Took me a good 15 minutes of hell before i found out i could play in full screen mode, horrible without it imo.<BR>got Horribly lost in all the cities (couldnt tell the difference between quenos and FP) and to this day i still believe that the cities in EQ are horribly designed, and almost impossible to find anything in <BR>without a map. the list goes on and on. Load times are indeed bad, mine have gone back to normal since i disbled all SoL graphics but you must know that you did not pick a great time to start EQ with all the technical issues its currently facing.<P> Given this was my first RPG since Return to Krondor (remember that game?) it took me a long while to learn what i needed to, and even now with 2 characters in the 30's im still learning a lot. Keep it up though, EQ is a fun game once you get your berings.<P><BR>cheers<BR>

ok my 2 coppers.<P>Ok 1st I would rather see someone return the game then whine about it. Its not someone I want playing in my group.<P> 2) forget sence heading look up the clouds always move east to west (what a concept) or drop a cheap weapon on the ground it always points north. <P>3) I must of missed the patch to randomly comeback in different areas after dying anyone know where I can get that?<P>4) EQ is played on aprox (help me out here guys) 1400 servers imagine that zoning and having to be moved to a different server due to the zone your going into. Yeah that might take a little bit of time.<P>5) My experience has been if I didnt know how to do something I would ask Your not the only one in the game other players will be more then happy to help you out.<P>6) /help what a wonderful command<P>7) Maybe a new computer would help worse Ive ever had is a drop to desktop while playing due to a memmory error with something else running on my system that messed up the game.<P>again just my 2 coppers safe travels and happy hunting<P>kagnar

Hey guys, don't ream this fella, he's tryin to make the right move and leave the evil ways of Microsoft and we should help him out best we can.  Here are a few things that you might be able to try bud:<P>*Reinstall windows!  <BR>-- I know this sounds like alot of the same ole crap, but my wife's machine ran EQ fine, until one day it started with excessive load/zone times, laggy performance in game, and frequent crashes to desktop.  I reinstalled EQ since my windows environment seemed to work fine and all the other programs seemed to work fine.  With some excessive persuassion from my wife to fix the problem I wiped the drive clean and reinstalled windows and EQ.... *problem solved*<P>*Get rid of that crap Winmodem! <BR>-- I worked for a techsupport for a local ISP, THE LARGEST problem that we encountered were win-modems... for those of you who don't know what one of these are, it's 1/2 a modem hardware-wise and the rest of the modem is emulated or "pretended" to be there by the operating system.  Reason for doing this is lower cost.  The real problem with this is that when you start putting a load on your machine (ex. playing 3D games), windows is nice enough to kill lower priority applications temporarily to keep from interrupting the program you are working in...in doing this you lose connection and your EQ  program craps anyway.... Win-modems come stock in most Gateways, Compaq's, HP's, and just about any other prefab machine you buy nowadays.<BR>--  Solution - Purchase a hardware modem, they cost a bit more than win-modems, but in the long run they are worth it... most external modems are hardware modems, try to steer clear of the USB ones; however, since USB technology isn't 100% stable in itself.<P>*Try changing servers-<BR>--Different servers have different load times on them at different times of the day, try a few different ones, make a character and just see how it loads, you don't have to spend 8 hours playing a character to find out it takes a long time to load on that server.  I'm sure you'll make new friends on any of the servers you decide on, I find that all of the servers generally have the same good-hearted people on them...with the exception of the PvP servers *beams a smile*<P>Try changing ISP's-<P>--Not all ISP's are the same, as far as AOL and any online game I personally wouldn't recommend it, ever since my Diablo days I've heard people complain about getting disconnected and lag while playing on AOL's  service... Know what? Users of the all new AOL version 7.0 complain about slow download times, disconnects, and crappy connections just as much as AOL version 3.0 users did.  Before you boldly jump and say "We'll I don't use AOL, I use &lt;insert well-known dialup ISP here&gt; check to see who actually owns the ISP, chances are if it comes with a really cool program you can use to chat with AOL users, you're using an AOL clone.  Look into Cable/DSL service in your area, talk to some people and find out which one is better in your area, (Both of these services are good, depending on how bad the cable or phone lines sucks in your area determines which one is actually *better*)<P>Hope some of this helps you get in the game, if you need some more questions feel free to send me a tell.<P>Neomega Spiritlife<BR>45th Warrior of Mith Marr

You probably picked one of the worst times to start playing EQ. The new expansion has caused alot of issues that weren't there before. <P>My advice is to put it down for a bit, let things with the technical issues get fixed then come back.<P>The game is good, or I'm a masochist, can't figure out which. I keep quitting and returning. Been playing since the beta.<BR><p>[This message has been edited by Tisual (edited 01-15-2002).]

C'mon guys, is this how we (eq players) welcome people from other games? He was mad that EQ was not working right, don't jump on him like it's your child he is talking about..If he has played nothing but AC before, do you think he knows what zoning is? AC and EQ = diffent as heaven and hell

As a new player myself (under two weeks) I have to say I can understand you criticism but the game is worth playing. The thing to remember is it is roll playing you have to learn to walk before you can run and run before you can fight and if you dont know ask. I have nothing but praise for the players on EQ when i was in trouble they help when I asked questions that seem dumb to me now I always got an answer and advice.<P>As for you technical problems I would strongly suggest you check for pc first and your Internet connection there are many tools and web sites that will help you in this. But the biggest culprit is probably your operating system if it is not configured properly or has a virus it may only show up on certain applications so check it out. I also found in my own experience that you get a better response and performance if you set the game screen resolution to mach your normal viewing resolution or the other way a round. <BR>.<BR>Bazza the philosopher Troll<BR>"bashing good but sometimes you get bashed back"

I'm going to answer your comments in random order, but I'll number them so that everyone can follow.<P>4.  One thing I noticed that no one seemed to comment on relating to bind points and returning after you die... based on a comment you wrote, Wanderer, you assumed that when it says "character saved" that that changed where you were bound... this is not the case.  (I believe it's a back up of the information to the database from your computer when you get that message.)  Your bind point is always the same unless someone casts a spell to change it (or you talk to a soulbinder, since Luclin).  This might solve your random bind point issue.<P>1. As far as the connection screens, the only one I think they could remove is the liscence agreement, and maybe the one that gives you access to account options (though that would be harder, I think)... every time I connect there's a possibility I'll be playing my account, there's a possibility I'll be loading my sedondary account, and there's a small chance I'll be running my husband's account... therefore, I need the account name and password screen, the server select screen, and the character select screen... with those needed, the other two clicks are nothing.  If you're restarting frequently, hitting escape during the Sony/Verant screens (between the liscence and the options screen) makes them pass by in an instant... just don't hit it for the options screen or you'll drop back to Windows).<P>6 and 7. If you joined our wonderful world just after Luclin, I do pity you.  My husband (an acknowledged addict) was threatening to cancel his account, and I (usually EXTREMELY patient) was getting a bit frustrated with it.  For the most part now, though, those major issues have been resolved.  Do you still have problems now (or have you already given up)?<P>2. Dying is supposed to be painful.  The wonderful thing about EQ is that you don't have to lose ANY of your items if you can get back to your corpse.  And there's a reasonable time-frame allowed to find your corpse... 1/2 hour for newbies (below level 5, I think) and either 24 hours in game or 7 days out of game after that.<P>5. It is quite likely you're playing in what I call the "grey" screen mode.  If this is the case, it makes sense that you're having difficulty.  Hit F10 to cycle between that mode, transparent mode, and full-screen mode.  Full-screen mode is usefull only when you want to admire the view, as you can't see any of the controls.  I avoid the grey screen mode whenever possible.<P>3.  Solved.<P>I think that's it... hope you stuck around... this really is a good game...<p>[This message has been edited by Evenstar (edited 02-09-2002).]

Boy, was I and the 400,000 wrong.  In the 3 days I've played I've been disconnected DOZENS of times (the only time I've been able to exit the system correctly back to Windows is when I tried to connect and it wouldn't let me connect, otherwise it has locked the system and normally I have to reboot (an no, I was not impatient, I let it sit for half an hour once and thru a NFL game another time)), you have to go thru  8 screens and manually interact with 5 to get in, long delays when you can get in (I haven't been able to get in at all today due to server congestion), the attack action is pretty lame and hard to see if you're in or out of it, not a whole lot of room on the characters and it takes time to move between screens, very limited documentation (most of the commands I've used have come from internet sites like this one), there's no way to know where you're at unless you stay near landmarks (makes my ranger's tracking skill pretty worthless), you don't even know which direction you're facing (yes, I've hot keyed the sense heading button and you can EVENTUALLY find out, but when you have an orc centurion on your tail that's not so great &lt;grin&gt; ), you randomly appear someplace after you die (last night I started showing up near a lift I hadn't been to for 5 reincarnations), and you lose everything if you die.</STRONG><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Try getting a GOOD computer (since the one you have a piece of crap) and actually learn what you're doing... if it doesn't work then, wait till you're older then 10 =P.<BR>(btw, you don't loose a damn thing when dying until lvl 10, which you couldn't have attained since you said you couldn't get a reliable connection... which leads to my next great idea for you... get a GOOD ISP)<P>--------------------<P>- Poots<BR>newb on E'ci
