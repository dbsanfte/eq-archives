</FONT><HR><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Hail!<P>I've wanted to include strategy guides on my site for quite some time, but never really worked out how to do them well, since I wanted a forum-like way to do it.  Well, now that I have forums, here goes...  Feel free to add/comment to what I've written, or to post your own strategy guides here as well.<P>This is the first part of a (hopefully) two-part strategy guide to hunting in Dalnir.  This part will focus on general hunting-in-Dalnir issues, the second part on specific areas in the dungeon.  I chose Dalnir because I frequently see it underutilized, and when it is it's usually by two groups hanging out by the front door like a bunch of chickens.<P>Basic Concepts:<BR>1) Dalnir is a "do-able" dungeon.  What this means is that many of the creatures in a given area are of relatively the same level and strength.  If you can fight in the front hallway without having to zone every other battle, chances are you can fight anywhere on the first two levels of the dungeon.  The difficulty gets slightly higher as you move through, with areas of third level actually easier than on the second, however the exit on the third level is surrounded by the toughest critters in the zone, making escape not as safe as on level two.<P>2) Many MOB's in Dalnir are non-aggro.  This is a benefit to you if you are careful.  A typical example is the following, your group is hunting in L room on level one.  There is a MOB by the door (where you are camped) and three that spawn in the back.  From here you can pull from outside pretty steadily.  Many goos and nibblers are non-aggro, which means that even if you sit down to meditate, they won't attack you.  In the L room, we frequently do not attack non-aggro mobs to leave the room as a safe area, where we can rest and do everything without fear.  If you come in and there are some aggro mobs, kill them off and keep doing so until some non-aggro ones spawn.  This concept is key for moving around and clearing areas in the first two levels.  If they don't attack you, praise Bristlebane and move on.<P>3) Coerced.  A few pointers on the coerced creatures.  First of all, all of them except the goblins and the iksar are considered "summoned" creatures.  Clerics and druids, brush off those spells.<P>Second, be careful of how many of these you pull.  Since many of them are casters, they can really make a battle go sour if you get the wrong kind.  My least favorite is the annoying female gnome magician with her earth elemental pet.  Try and pull to your group when you wind up rooted by some damn elemental, and you'll see what I mean.  Harm Touch from SK's and the bad DoT's from the necros can really make your night go bad. Some of the healers (since NPC's seemingly can't be interrupted) can take like 5 minutes to polish off.  Take them one at a time if you can.<P>Many of the good drops in the zone come off of random little coerced creatures.  There is no way to predict where a specific coerced will spawn, but you can tell which ones will drop which items.  For instance, the Charred Tulwar drops off of a male DE that looks like a newbie.  The Tower Guard's Blade drops off of a (male?) Erudite in Banded type armor.  You'll learn them, but since you can't predict or control their spawns, it's more out of interest sake.<P>4) Crowd Control is priceless.  This is true in pretty much any dungeon, but is very true here.  The most successful groups I've had by far are those with an enchanter (thanks Sanelr and Vivix!) or a good bard (rare).  This is even more true when doing things like camping the Imp room on level two, for instance, where it has three fairly fast spawns before the Imp spawns, as well as spawns outside the room, so a group can get really hurt really fast without some way to pace battles.<P>5) Know where your exits are.  I think lots of people are afraid that the exits are hard to get to or something, and so won't go down to lower levels and stick by the front zone.  The exit on the second level is the easiest thing in the world to get to (unless you meet my favorite coerced), the one on the third is a bit harder because it's like running over a long stretch of hot coals with gasoline on your feet, but still pretty easy to do.  You can camp one of these exits just as easily as you do the ones on lvl 1.<P>6) Pits are a way of life in Dalnir.  It is up to you if you want to use levitate or not.  The worst fall is about 280 hps that I've seen, although be aware that the falling bug for 10k hps of damage will really mess you up.  The only times I've seen this happen are when people who are freefalling get caught on top of people who are levitating and then drop off of them.  Let the freefallers go first.  I honestly find levitate to be a pain, since you're likely juggling invis'ing everyone to go down without getting swarmed, and coordinating all that casting for a group is hard.<P>7)  Monk Heaven.  Few places in the game have the same amount of loot for monks as here.  They have crescent armor here for them, as well as some of the great monk weapons come out of here.  Plus, feign pulling is super handy in this zone as a way around needing crowd control (above).<P>8)  Don't be afraid to move in.  I've stated it above, but I'll state it more here.  Any group made up of 6 lvl 30's (on average) can take any room on the first two levels.  If you are well-balanced and have a monk and enchanter, you can do so practically without fear of death.<P>9)  Be nice to others here.  Many times I've entered, people have been very rude to others in the dungeon, I think cuz they are worried we're going to steal their Lumpy or something.  Give it a rest.  A lot of the good stuff for various classes is No Drop, so say if a piece of Crescent drops, let everyone know it's there so some monk can come get it.  Same holds true for the other quest items off of the Imprecators.  It pays off later when you are looking for a group in the zone, and I've made many friends while hunting there.<P>Oh well, I think that's all my advice.  If I think of more I'll add it in, and feel free to add to this.  Hopefully in the next few days I'll add in some more info about specific parts of the dungeon.<P>Die, Kly, Die!!<P>------------------<BR>Muse<BR>Bard and Cartographer</FONT>

</FONT><HR><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">    After having just been in Dalnir over a 4 day period last week I can say that most of the guide's comments are true. There are a couple of clarifications needed though. <BR>    First, crowd control is essential, not an optional, part of being successful deeper in the dungeon. If you don't have an enchanter in your party or the aforementioned good Bard it is quite risky to go deeper in Dalnir. <BR>    The second part is that you need to be able to have confidence in your group. If you work well together you can prosper but if a mistake is made it can easily result in total party wipeout, with more deaths as you try to get back in to your corpses and retrieve your stuff. Move as a group and be prepared to leave as a group if someone has to go. It is no fun to have to wait around the entrance for 3 hours until a high level player can get there to escort you to your body and out.<BR>     As a final note: if you count on invis to scout places out DON'T drop down to the 3rd level unless you have both reg invis and invis to undead up. The Undead Blacksmith can see through reg invis and spawns close enough to the entry room in 3rd floor that he can aggro you. You are then in a world of hurt.</FONT>

</FONT><HR><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I have been doing Dalnir's since before they took out the Necklace of Superiority, and I have to say that this is a great post. Lots of good info.<BR>BUT, as a level 30 bard, what suggestions would you have for being "good" at crowd control?  I can think of a few things.  "Charm", but I usually end up dead when the mob breaks charm and aggros me.  "Lullaby", not usually very helpful, too often resisted.  "Pixie Strike", Mez's, but not for long, and builds up aggro pretty quick. <BR>BTW, my CHAR without adding a stein or something is 120.<BR>Would love any advice,<BR>Lyz</FONT>

</FONT><HR><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">You can obviously tell this guide is very old, for now, every mob is aggro EXCEPT about 3 of the wandering ravenous nibblers(not all of them though.) Secondly, you cannot sit nor meditate near ANY mob in the game unless it is an non-aggro NPC. Even if it is a non-aggro monster, it will attack you if it sees you sitting down. Thirdly, many of the coerced now have pets, and those tier dal magicians can really kill ya, and i MEAN KILL YA.<P>------------------<BR>Xaruliz Lethalshadow<BR>&lt;Reptilian Empire&gt;<BR>Monk of the 28th Rung of Laughter</FONT>

</FONT><HR><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I for one LOVE Dalnir. I ventured to this dungeon as a level 30 Monk with a Level 29 Cleric partner. Absolutely THE best experience I've ever seen in a hell level (and as an Iksar Monk it really was hell  <IMG SRC="http://www.eqatlas.com/ubb/wink.gif"> )<BR>This dungeon is mostly a BYoG zone. There really aren't many people hunting in the zone anymore. But the experience modifier is just amazing. I leveled from 30 to 35 in here in just a few days. Picked up a couple Saps of Piety, a Fighting Baton, several Charred Tulwars, and did I mention the experience per kill was amazing?<BR>Pulling wasn't really a problem in this dungeon as I had practiced up my FD pulling on small camps in outdoor zones. The only time that was a real problem was trying to split up a group of coerced caster types. Timing feign so that none of them are casting on you can be VERY painful. The Shadowknights were actually the easiest. Go in, eat the Harmtouch(s), feign, run back to the cleric to get healed and you have about 5 minutes or so before their Harmtouch refreshes. <BR>we moved to the second floor the last day I spent there before moving on to greener pastures. An Enchanter isn't a real necessity if you know what you're doing. I set my group up behind the little altar thing in the pool room of the second floor and started feign pulling till I had broken the spawn well. Turned all of the pool room spawns non-aggro helped a LOT! From then on I was rapid fire pulling, cleared the entire floor several times. <BR>One thing to watch out for, Three are two coerced that spawn in the IMP room on Floor two that are quest NPC's (oops) Bad thing to lose Beta-neutral faction for killing them. ONe was a Coerced Crusader and the Other was I believe a Coerced Invoker or Evoker, both Iksar in some NICE looking armor that unfortunately doesn't drop.<P>Seaden Maniac<BR>35 Iksar Monk of the Swifttails </FONT>

</FONT><HR><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Chanter Guide to Dalnir<P>It is quite amazing how well an enchanter can do here, really it is.  My DE enchanter, having 156 INT at lvl 23, was able to come here and convince people I was ready to group... that early.  People love enchanters here.  First, the monks love hastes, AC buffs, etc. because it helps them keep a faster pace going.  That's the key, the pace of battles.  People don't want to get bogged down so they want to move fast.  <P>Another reason enchanters are so great here has a lot to do with Pace too.  Mana regeneration.  Breeze/Clarity keep the casters functioning (especially the clerics and wizards) in such a fast area.  People want constant pulls, and don't appreciate a free-loader.  <P>Everyone there will cheer you when you shout "DING 29"and they will tell  you to whip out the new spells.  When you can cast some of the best buffs and debuffs in the game (for that level of course), people appreciate it.  <P>Enchanters will burn through mana so fast it will boggle your mind.  Don't get frustrated though, just know what you are spending your mana on.  Seems stupid to say that, but really, Enchanters are in heaven here and sometimes get overloaded with things to do (that's why we're one of the hardest casters to play).  It is here that you will find that chanters are almost MADE to help monks.<P>If you are an enchanter, or a monk (preferably Iksar   <IMG SRC="http://www.eqatlas.com/ubb/wink.gif">), I would HIGHLY suggest playing here.  It will be very profitable (especially if the chanter gets Illusion Iksar), and it will gain you good experience in how to function as a group member.  This is, I believe, the best place to learn how to function in a dungeon.<P>And a note for the pkers on Rallos Zek... this is just about the worst place to pk in the world.  The dungeon is too tight a space, and everyone is in a moderate to full group.  And if you pk here your name gets around REAL FAST.  Whenever someone attacked myself or my Iksar monk friend, they were marked in everyone's minds for future reference.  Nobody pk's in Dalnir for more than two days without being kicked out in the worst kind of way the next tiem they show their face.  Don't even become a SUSPECTED pker, really.<P>And have fun in Dalnir!  Should keep you going til 34, when you can run on over to City of Mist (for you monks, wait til lvl 35)<P>EDITED NOTE: By the way, you should get your research skill up before coming here (do concordance of research if necessary, it's worth it).  There is a mopderate amount of dropping pages for all INT casters.  But you do NOT want to fail when you get those pages that give you Tepid Deeds or Feedback.  These are priceless additions to your arsenal and you absolutely have to get them the first time.<P>EDITED NOTE 2:  Keep an eye out for the higher lvl boys who come here to get the rare drops, to give to their friends or lower lvl characters.  A very kind Mage named Grento gave me a Robe of the Foci after he heard me auctioning to buy enchanter research pages.  He figured I needed it asa replacement to my FBR more than he needed to go selling it, and he had been doing the quest to gain faction.  He also tried to give me a Sarnak Ceremonial Dagger, but alas it is Lore and I already had one.<p>[This message has been edited by Warrsaw Pact (edited 08-14-2001).]</FONT>

</FONT><HR><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">The big secret! This is used by my guild. We hunt the Imp and Lumpy ALL the time. When you first drop down walk up to every ravenous nibbler you see and check if it aggroes. 80% of the time, the ones on floor 2 will NOT aggro. So if you let them alone, you're free to just fight the PHs and rare mobs when they spawn! Just some info...</FONT>

</FONT><HR><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Elder Guild members used the 'L' Room as a training ground. Some important lessons I learned as a recently levelled SK 22 and as a Newbie to EQ. <P>1. Having a group of 22 to 25 members being supervised by a lvl 33 Cleric is not enough to hold the room. (No bard, no enchanter = death(s)) Having a 2nd group of lvl 40 plus break off to go deeper means '/shout HELP' = too late.<P>2. Do not let pets chase down halls. 2nd Death was preceded by my skellie's bones hitting the floor, the msg 'Taunting Attacker's Master' (or something like it) and watching the Bizzaro Lolipop Guild  <IMG SRC="http://www.eqatlas.com/ubb/tongue.gif"> march into the room and flatten us.<P>3. If an agro mob, Lollipop Guild or other pops in your face, take 1 for the team and die there. (1 person to rez is a lot easier than 6.) (While you wait for the the Good Witch of the North to rez you, explore. I found fun being bound in The Overthere to jump up on the fence in the merchants area, pretend to be a gargoyle then when someone zoomed in to buy something jump down and scare the bejeezus out 'em.)  <IMG SRC="http://www.eqatlas.com/ubb/eek.gif"><P>Bronz Aloy<BR>Ogre SK 22</FONT>
