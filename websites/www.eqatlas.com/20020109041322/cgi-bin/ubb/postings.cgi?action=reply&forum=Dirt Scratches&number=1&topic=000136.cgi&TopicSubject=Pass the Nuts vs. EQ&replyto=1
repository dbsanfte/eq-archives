[B]Greetings All,

  i find your analogy to be pretty much dead on!  its kind of like those studies they do with rats, where they put a feeder bar in the cage that gives the rat either food or heroin.  and the rat just pounds on the heroine bar till its dead.  perhaps not as grim as that, but just as obsessive!  im not sure what it is that is soo compelling about EQ, that makes me play it inspite of its extremely high level of frustration.  in a way, i wish that the game were a bit easier for the more casual gamer, but im also leary of them changing it too much.  i have a feeling that if the  game were not so frustrating, i would have quit playing long ago.  i guess we are just gluttons for punishment!  hehe[/B][/QUOTE]

It's a game I played when I was about 8 years old, and it is kind of a mini-pinball game, where you have 4 animals and the objective is to have them kick this walnut up from one animal to the next, eventually to get it through a hole at the top, where it falls back to the bottom again. Hit the nut too hard and you hit the ledge above you, too soft and it won't make it to where it has to go. I spent days playing this when I was a kid, and I must have played it for 20 minutes after my little cousins got done with it until the bell sound every time you kicked it started to drive everyone around me crazy. Highly addictive.<P>Then it struck me how similar Pass the Nuts was to EQ. Highly addictive and yet highly frustrating at times. I used to try and get the nut all the way up without screwing up once when I was younger, and can remember crying when I failed (much like I cried at the end of Pitfall 2 when that damn poison frog whacked me on the final stairs, you know which one I'm talking about). I don't cry during EQ (not eight years old anymore), but my monitor has a little sign on it that says "don't punch me, I'm innocent" and that says it all. In Pass the Nuts, you continually strive to get higher up, and frequently fall down at least one level, sometimes all the way to the bottom. You can spend hours doing it, and even if you win, it just means you start over.<P>Anyway, there's more but if you don't get the analogy, more will just make you crazy as well. Maybe I had just eaten too much turkey...<P>------------------<BR>Muse<BR>Bard and Cartographer</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Firebizz</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Greetings All,<P>  i find your analogy to be pretty much dead on!  its kind of like those studies they do with rats, where they put a feeder bar in the cage that gives the rat either food or heroin.  and the rat just pounds on the heroine bar till its dead.  perhaps not as grim as that, but just as obsessive!  im not sure what it is that is soo compelling about EQ, that makes me play it inspite of its extremely high level of frustration.  in a way, i wish that the game were a bit easier for the more casual gamer, but im also leary of them changing it too much.  i have a feeling that if the  game were not so frustrating, i would have quit playing long ago.  i guess we are just gluttons for punishment!  hehe</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Fluvius</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Why am I reminded of that scene in The Matrix where Agent Smith goes on the big, furniture-chewing rant about how the original design of the matrix flopped because humans wouldn't accept a perfect world?<P>I laugh at Alan - Absor - whatever-the-new-flak's-name-is comments regarding "casual" players that I read over at everlore not too long ago. Somebody had brought up the standard rant that EQ should be more kind to casual players and Mr. PR spends about two paragraphs saying, yes, EQ IS designed for casual players -- only he condescendingly spent his two paragraphs interpreting 'casual' as 'laid-back, mellow player attitude' rather than 'would-be power gamer with limited time commitment', ie, what every simian knows we all mean.<P>Best part is the closing bits of his PR burst ACKNOWLEDGED that he was BS'ing us the whole time by saying something along the lines of oh, I wouldn't call them 'casual players', but 'limited time' players.<P>Perhaps this is how publicity flaks derive pleasure from having to listen to our unending complaints ... by practicing relentless spin.<P>At this point I would bring up that image of Kafka's from "The Trial" where the man seeking justice comes to the first gate with the big guard at it and says:<P>I seek justice.<P>And the guard says, well, you'll have to get by me, which is impossible, and even if you did, there's an even bigger guard and a stronger gate beyond me and I'm scared of him and BEYOND HIM is a guard and a gate that can make HIM piss himself with fright and so and so on so you'll just have to wait.<P>Maybe they will send for you.<P>So the guy waits his whole life.<P>And at the end of it, through one dying eye he looks up at the first guard, and wheezes, "What are you doing?"<P>And the guard says to the poor sap, I'm closing the gate. It was just for you.<P>/flip Verant.<P>Anyway, I said I'd mention this whole story but I really can't condemn Verant fully because a kind GM saved my ass last night when I got stuck somewhere in the Ocean of Tears.<P>(Cue Lou Reed's 'Heroin'. Fade to black....)</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Highmagi</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">No I totally agree, everquest can be a big pain in the butt at times, but we still come back for more. I remember this last monday, I was trying to make lvl 11. I would kill something then die and lose the xp, then kill something and die, etc...... It went on for 7 hours, never once did I give up though. I was determind (my family says obsessed) with making lvl 11. Then when I finally made, I died twice and lost the lvl, I felt like logging and calling it quits. I didn't though, killed two scarabs and a lion and got my lvl back, and then managed to find someone to power level me. <BR> Even with this patch thing, fans are willing to run out and buy new vidoe and sound cards just so they can continue playing. If that isn't a addiction then I don't know what is! Anyway, I just wanted to say u hit the nail on the head. Everyone stay safe and keep leveling!<BR> And this goes without saying but Verant is EVIL!!!!
