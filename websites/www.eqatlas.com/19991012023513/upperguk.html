<h3>
<font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
Upper Guk is the upper level of one of the largest dungeons to be found
in the entire realm of Norrath, and home to one of the most advanced societies,
on par with the Kerrans. It is a vast and twisting place, filled with the
frogloks and laden with their unique treasures.
<h3>
<font size=+2>D</font>angers</h3>
Upper Guk is an extremely dangerous place to adventure in. This is due
to a variety of factors, starting with the distribution of creatures throughout
the zone. I mapped most of this zone as an 11th level Wood Elf Ranger,
who had never killed a froglok in his life, and not one froglok attacked
me. This is a good thing, because once I was two rooms out from the main
water room with the bridge, every froglok was tombstone to me. The depths
are filled with even more dangerous frogloks, and there is close proximity
of low and high level frogloks throughout the zone. One has to be careful
who they pick a fight with, because around the corner could lie a froglok
warrior five levels higher. In conjunction with this, the frogloks work
together well. In the very first room are usually two froglok tads, approximately
fourth level. In the next room are often at least one froglok guard, who
is approximately eighth level. If you attempt to fight this froglok and
draw him into the first room, the tads will begin to heal him and your
fight becomes a nightmare. Attempting to kill off the tads first is likewise
dangerous, as they will flee and then you'll have the guard at your back
while you try to finish off the tad. In other words, although the creatures
start at about 4th level, most of the people adventuring in the front rooms are at
least level 10.
<p>Probably as a result of the above, this place has some very dangerous
trains. These are not Blackburrow trains where there is one Elite Guard
mixed in with some Burly Gnolls, these are trains of 20th level and higher
warriors mixed with tads. These trains are even more dangerous because
of the ingeniously evil layout of the entrance of Guk. The entry hallway
is large enough to fit one ogre/troll, but no others can fit by. One AFK
ogre in the doorway equals your death. Also, the entry hall with the bridge
over the water is also very tricky to navigate, and will definitely slow
you down if you want to keep from falling into the water.
<p>I could go into much more about why this place is dangerous, but suffice
it to say that when I usually enter the zone, there are usually 15th to
20th level characters resting in the entry hallway, and they usually fight
in one or two rooms past the water room, drawing out frogloks from the
rooms beyond. If this sounds like your kind of place, then go on in. Also,
there is the difficulty of death and having to run from Freeport to Guk
naked...
<p>Also of note, most of the good races (I haven't checked them all) can
actually enter Guk and travel unhindered throughout it. This assumes, of
course, that you have never in your entire life killed a froglok. I didn't
make it further into the dungeon because it became tedious, but it's possible.
If you have killed a froglok, you will notice that you can still travel
throughout the dungeon unhindered, although this comes with a caveat. My
example is my wood elf, passing through the temple where he had previously
traveled unmolested, was attacked by every froglok present after a Tuk
Warrior took offense at my presence, and this after killing one froglok
forager in the swamp above. He actually would have outrun the train (probably
one of the more ugly in Guk history) but instead got caught in a blind
end water filled area where the crocs lair above. Be careful what you hunt...
<h3>
<font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>
Despite the above mentioned dangerousness of the zone, this has to be one
of the most popular dungeons in the game, the only problem with this is
that it is so far away from the majority of players, and the difficulty
at getting bound nearby for any of the good races. There are several reasons
for this, but the largest is that the frogloks are just plain rich. Even
the lowliest froglok possesses woven armor, which is about the equivalent
of banded armor for mage classes. It sells for about the same as well,
and monks will pay a great deal of money for the woven gloves, which count
as magical weapons for them.
<p>The other large amount of treasure is the magical equipment that comes
out of Guk. Many of the magical items listed on spoiler sites come from
the depths of Guk, and I feel that Guk is one of the most well-developed
areas within the game.

<font size=+2>G</font>uk</h3>
There is one entrance into Upper Guk from the Innothule Swamp. The entrance
is guarded on the outside by two froglok guards, and on the inside has
a narrow corridor guarded by at least one higher level froglok guard.
<p>The entrances to Lower Guk are apparently many in number, but I have
never personally found any of them, despite traveling far into the zone.
