</FONT><HR><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">  <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Originally posted by DbardRN:<BR><B>funny thing about a lot of these posts is that the ones who are the most infavor of VIs position seem to be kinda low level...its simple really, a dungeon like lguk, sol b, you cant realistically do because of the lvl disparity in MOBS, extremely low risk vs reward, spawn times, agro range, pathing....THAT is one of the main reasons people camp those places</B><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Unofrtunantly this is correct within a certain frame.  Yes you do have to camp within a zone in order to enjoy the riches of the spawn.  Yes you have camp within a zone in order to wait for a certain item to drop.. Yes they drop like say 5% of the monsters that spawn, ie takes 100 monsters to get 5 items(for the mathmaticly challenged).<P>Yes I am low level but do not agree nor disagree with VI's stance. I personally think if they could weed out the farmers then a bunch of camps will OPEN up for others to enjoy.<P>Not to mention as a person, such as yourself, who is that high level player. You have already paid your dues of dying and lost eq and long spawn times and such.  In short you have earned the right to use that special item you got from hard work and long hours of playing.  Why not allow the newer players the same chance that you had when you were not so old?  Why not stop people that have no REASON other then to get and sell the item to have their chance at EARNING it?  I personally would LOVE to be able to go into lguk and EARN a yak but the chances are slim I'll have the chance since I am one of those who only has a couple hours a day to play and thus can't sit there at the entrance and get on the list to join the group that is camping the spot that the yak drops from.  I've seen lists as long as 15 people in HHP waiting to join an orc group or a gnoll group.  I asked the list holder for the names.  Talked to each person and got a group of six goin and we SHARED the orcs with the first group.  Reason: there spawns 8-10 orcs within a VERY short period.  At times it overwhelsm the group that is there and they have to zone or die.  We were able to keep it down and both groups had a great time.  SHARE people, it makes life oh so much nicer and EQ alot more fun to play.<P><BR>------------------<BR>Ohlim Spiderstomper<BR>Ogre Warrior of Povar<BR>Way of the Wolf<p>[This message has been edited by Macrai (edited 09-05-2000).]</FONT>

</FONT><HR><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I had also mentioned the aspect of Sharing that should exist between players, but many of the players are Selfish or Greedy or both....<P>Farming items is where the true problems arise, because obviously there is SOME degree of farming for experience that is unavoidable. <P>When someone is sitting the same spawn to get 12 of the same item, then it is hardly conceivable that this is either fun or worthwhile from an experience standpoint. The only reason for item camping is to get an item for yourself (one time/one item) or camping as a means to resell for profit (meaning more than one time/item). People who get multiple items with the SOLE INTENTION of reselling them/making profit are the ones that ruin "camping", and are so selfish/greedy that it causes problems. <P>I also agree with a previous post that mentioned that camping does not really effect the lower levels as much as the higher levels, but it is still a situation that greed/selfishness causes more than antthing else... Limiting the number of times an item can be collected by each individual seems to be a solution, but camping is not something that can be eliminated all together...<BR><P>------------------<BR>Blackivar the Cunning<BR>Halfling Rogue<BR>15th Season<BR>Druzzil Ro Server</FONT>

</FONT><HR><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Until my trip to Kurns tower I had never "done a dungeon" as per the 'Vision'.  If there was something I needed I would go hunting for that MOB or room and camp.  I frequently would move about a place like Crushbone or Black Burrow to hunt out fun but that was not until most of the Mobs there were not a danger soloing.  The difference I saw immediately in Kunark was much smaller agro range and better more predictable pathing.  With a group of 4 19th to 20th chars we were able to do a dungeon crawl through the stables clearing room after room or hall after hall just mining our way through mobs.  The ability to get Mobs that give exp in usually predictable quantities gave us enough control of the risk that we could work through the dungeon.  I think dungeon layout, pathing unpredictability (ask anyone who has tried to pull out the side door of unrest) and the work it takes to break a room that swarms is what leads to the camping.  Oh that and the fact that the loot table is not partially random like in Kunark.<P>A dungeon crawl like the 'vision' has can be fun but the factors required to make it happen are not always there.  Crush or Dvinn will die to a camper or a train catcher, not to someone 'doing crushbone'.  Any group 'doing crushbone' in the vision way are either so high it is just a vengence trip or getting minor goods for twinkies.<P>------------------<BR>--<BR>Failleron<BR>Hail Brell<BR>--<BR>"if you can remain calm, you just don't have all the facts." - asr</FONT>

</FONT><HR><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Now, come on! From many years in product marketing it so easy to decode what he is saying.<P>Look at the motives folks! All Verant emploees in sales and marketing have ONE purpose; REVENUE. Verant has two sources of revenue buying the box 450 swedish kronor in my case AND 10$ (96 SEK). If you can keep people playing more than 5 months you have made the same money as selling two boxes. The sales of Kunark prolongs the sense of freshnes. So that brings in more 10$.<BR>Now lets look at FUN. FUN is another word for buying months. Lets see will TIMESINKS buy more months? YES. TIMESINKS (camping for instance) = FUN. You simply can NOT have Verant employees say that timesinks are good for you guys. Hence the twisted logic decreasing camping is decreasing fun.<P>Remember fun is = you play for months. If you reach 60 fast you get bored.</FONT>

</FONT><HR><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Bah!  If you're griping about the game, you shouldn't be playing!<P>Who says you need the best equipment to have fun?  Nobody need an ultra-rare GBS or jboots or SMR (can you tell I'm a caster? :P ) to have fun or see all Norrath.  I personally have only camped 2 times for my current character, who had nothing given to him for twinking, and was even item wiped at level 30.  I camped for jboots (about 3 hours total) and for my and a friend's shadowbound quests (about 6 hours total).  I made it to level 45, I had fun, and I've made lots of friends.  <P>My equipment, at first glance, sucks.  The best items I have are 7int,7str necklace, all the shadowbound quest stuff (robe, gloves, boots, and harvester), a sheer bone mask and dagger of marnek.  All the rest can easily, and fairly, be considered "crap."  However, I have an int of 195, have been in every dungeon in Norrath except the Hole and Sol B, and in half of the Kunark zones.<P>Nobody has to camp.  If you dont like it, dont do it.  Yes, you can DO a dungeon still.  My favorite example of this is Paw.  The mobs get harder as you go further in and the spawn is a relatively quick one (6 mins I think).  I cannot count the number of times a few friends and I started at the entrance and decided to see how far in we could get.  Once we were unable to advance (eithier by encountering too many gnolls, too high of a level gnolls, or those pesky necro and enchanter gnolls, we would either a)die, or b) call it a night and come back in a few more levels.<P>My biggest pet peeve is when people complain that when they die, they lose 4 hours or whatever amount of "work."  EQ IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE WORK!  IF IT IS, DONT PLAY!  GET A (OR ANOTHER) JOB AND GET PAID FOR SO CALLED "WORK!"<P>Sorry about the ramblings and stream of thought writing, but had to get a few things of my chest.  <IMG SRC="http://www.eqatlas.com/ubb/smile.gif"></FONT>

</FONT><HR><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">OK if Verant feel they are in a catch 22 with not being able to change to loot & difficulty of dungeons Vs camping.  Wouldnt the obvious thing to do is to spread the loot around?  <P>For example, if you were after something specific, lets say the Flowing Black Robe on Najena.  Now I know that she doesnt always drop it everytime...but what if she wasnt the only one that could drop it?  Give random wandering high lvl npc's a chance to drop it also. <P>However we wouldnt want there to be too many FBR's swamping the economy (wait what am I saying?!) so you reduce the occurence of Najena dropping it.<P>So the chance of a FBR dropping is the same but it could come from a number of sources.  Najena drops it once in a blue moon which discourages all but the die hard camper.  Voila!  <P>Yes i'm sure that would cause some screaming from the loot farmers out there, but wouldnt it bring back the element of chance and adventuring?<P>------------------<BR>If one cannot be interesting...at least one can be annoying!</FONT>

</FONT><HR><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I believe that this problem is occuring because of the way that exp points are rewarded in the game. OK, combat and camping should be rewarded as long as the it is a challenge, but, I also believe that other activities should reward you with experience. Things like travelling and seeing new places, learning new languages, grouping with different races, practicing trade skills. OK this is partly compensated by the quests in the game but i think a lot more could be done.</FONT>

</FONT><HR><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">&gt;The other problem, though, and in my<BR>&gt;opinion the biggest one, is the fact that<BR>&gt;the game, despite having a "preferred<BR>&gt;method" of doing the dungeon, is in<BR>&gt;fact designed for people to camp. Spawns <BR>&gt;and drops are static, so people looking <BR>&gt;for a particular item go to that room <BR>&gt;and set up shop.<P>AHA!!! You hit on something I have been thinking about.  <IMG SRC="http://www.eqatlas.com/ubb/biggrin.gif"><P>A. If rewards (especially dropped loot) are normally located in static and predictable places, especially predictable spawns, then this logically is a stimulus for camping. <P>B. If "something better than camping" is desired (either by players or by Verant), then there has to be an enticement to give rewards for those who adventure and move about beyond static camps (or even static dungeons). <P>C. Why not put MORE dynamic (randomly timed, randomly moving, NON-static located, you-can-never guess-where-they-will-be) spawns and the treasures associated with them? In fact, this already happens to a small degree.... and it's called "The GM Events". Also a few wandering/roaming rewarding (in XP and loot) mobs already exist in some zones, Giants are one example. <P>D. A successful execution of "C" will give more incetives for travellers/roamers. It will award random rewards for players who *actually* move about and explore and keep walking around, rather than sitting a camp all night long in the same exact place, knowing the same monsters they can kill, knowing exactly what mobs will pop that they will kill. <P>Again, why not put in place some *rewarding* mobs that are dynamic and unpredictable, rather than static? For that matter, why not put *NAMED* spawns that can randomly appear in several zones (not simultaneously of course), instead of being based in just one zone. Why not? <P>E. Yes I am aware of wandering monsters. I am ignoring that factor, because most wandering monsters (like wandering skeletons that roam entire zones) are not considered "rewarding" and are nothing more than distractions that get in your path. There are rare exceptions, like Giants that provide good XP and drop decent loot for characters high enough to slay them. <P>How about the existence of medium-level wandering spawns? Except that they arent so incredibly red (like Giants are to most players) that they butcher every lesser creature in their path? How about adding THOSE for mid-level characters to bump into? <P>Or how about one for the newbies/lowlies?<P>Newbies spend tons of time killing bats and skeletons and such. Why not put a random spawn of a "special skeleton" mob, maybe a slightly tougher skeleton leader. The operational word here is "slightly higher level". It should be tough enough to give the average newbie a scare, but not so impossible that it goes around killing ALL the newbies. <P>The newbie/lowlie that is tough enough to survive an encounter should be rewarded decent XP and maybe some magic item drop that will make them smile for a few days. <P>And why not? When was the last time anyone saw an untwinked lowlie capable of killing ANY mob that dropped magic items? In my experience, never. <P>IMHO, none of my suggestions are outrageous, impossible or unfeasable to implement. All of them provide additional rewarding challenges and encounters.... without having to sit in a camp all night long. <P>Nor did I suggest anything that would really "throw off the game balance" IMHO. =) <P>And yet something tells me it will never be listened to by Verant.  <IMG SRC="http://www.eqatlas.com/ubb/frown.gif"> <P>*sigh* <BR></FONT>

I say this because as a cleric, I suck at Melee  <IMG SRC="http://www.eqatlas.com/ubb/smile.gif"> and if I can't find a group I either log and play another character, or I have to find a mob that I can solo with an acceptable amount of risk.<P>However, I wonder if Verant has considered the effect farming has on the Norrath "economy".  Although some items sell for an extremely high price (Gauntlets of the Black 3K on my server), There are mobs that drop enough cash so that people don't have to risk a high level NPC to get that crucial item.  Basically, for the majority of items in the game all it takes is the right amount of Plat and you can have a good item with no risk.  <P>It is this clerics simple hope that VI can come to some acceptable conclusion on this matter.<P>Datokk Fyreblood<BR>Cleric, 37th Season<BR>Seventh Hammer Server<BR>"Please leave something in the collection plate when you visit the First Church of Innoruuk"</FONT>

</FONT><HR><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Another aspect of the camping problems is vendors. I mean think about it. What items do u buy from vendors to equip after lvl 1-10??? After that full set of leather and bastard sword gets replaced there's no more use for vendors as equipable-item sellers. I mean just look at the price versus AC of chain and plate armor. I can get an entire set of banded for about 1/15th the price of a set of chain armor from a vendor and it's got far more ac. 1500pp for a plate mail breastplate with 17ac???? You would need to be lvl 35+ minimum to reasonably afford that without cheating and by then what good is a meager 17ac BP? I've never seen any weapon worth buying from vendors past level 10. I don't know about all of you but one of the things I liked best about RPG's was being able to travel to a new town and see what kindof good wpns + armor i could get there. In EQ that does not exsist. Also, why does that vendor buy my gnoll hide lariat for 1pp and then sell it for 25pp??? I always thought that vendors should buy for about half what they sell for. (Ex.) I loot a chain-mail skirt from a MOB in South Karana. This item sells in the store for about 100-200pp they offer 3pp for it... What is up with that??? My runewood great staff is worth 1Kpp, vendor will buy for 5pp. There isn't a higher lvl player anywhere thats going to make that sale. Verant has managed to make even the simple act of selling loot an excruciatingly long process to get anywhere near a reasonable price. Frankly, I dont feel like sitting in East Commons tunnel auctioning for 6+ hours (real-time) just to sell any decent items ive looted. I know that there is no chance of VI putting decent equip for sale on vendors. So why can't they at least put armor or weapons I would equip on the same level mobs? Or at least on quests that can be completed at the same level. As far as I know the only way to get somewhat decent equip is to save a ton of money and get it from player auctions. If higher level people weren't camping items it wouldn't be surprising to see lvl 25+ players still running around in banded/bronze. </FONT>

</FONT><HR><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Personally, I've played a large number of PC games.  I've played every one of these games that have a multiplayer component online.  After 2 months of playing EQ, I must say that I have never seen so many BITCHERS in my history of computer gaming.<P>Every message board (with the sometimes exception of this one) devoted to EQ seems to be full of whiners and bitchers.  Who are these people and why do they insist on complaining about a game that they obviously can't stop playing???<P>Yes, camping sucks.  KSers suck.  The fact that I sometimes spend 3 hours working on a corpse retrieval for a friend or guildmate sucks.  But still, somehow, every moment I spend in Norrath is worthwhile and fun to me.  <P>I don't camp dungeons yet, and I don't know many high level players who do.  I know that when I camped the Testament in HH for my druid, I had 3 different people come in invis to steal the camp.  (See Invis is a wonderful spell during the 7.5 hours you'll be sitting there.)  Each time, I called a GM and the problem was solved.  The interesting thing is this: when Dyllin finally did spawn, three people showed up and aggroed the other bandits for me while I killed him.  They were all complete strangers and each one of them congratulated me on getting the page.<P>So, yes, there are things about EQ that realy suck.  But, as with the above story, there are some really neat things about EQ, also.  If those bad things outweigh the good things for some people, perhaps their ten bucks a month would be better spent elsewhere.  Dungeon crawling in EQ is not going to change.  The pharmers and campers aren't going to leave.  And apparently (much to everyone's disappointment), neither are the disenchanted babies who play this game despite the fact that they obviously hate it.<P>Caladin<BR>26th Druid<P>Garanie<BR>21st Warrior<P>[This message has been edited by Garanie (edited 05-15-2001).]<p>[This message has been edited by Garanie (edited 05-15-2001).]</FONT>

</FONT><HR><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Muse:<P>"This game, though, caters to the extreme one end of the spectrum where you must devote your life to hitting 50th in order to see some of the coolest parts of the world. I think everyone who buys the game should be able to do that, and the way it is now we can't, and Verant is okay with that, and that's what bugs me."<P>I could not disagree more.  The harder something is to get the more rewarding it is.  To me it makes perfect sense to have areas of the game that are only availiable to the supper elite.  They put the effort in to get it and they deserve it.  That is not to say that everything on the way to the top is not fun.  I will probablly never make 40 and thats OK with me.  I just choose not to put that much effort into the game.  Its liek Skiing.  I will never be able to Ski the double diamond mogul slopes but I am not mad at the Ski Resports for putting them there.  The blue square slopes are good enough for me.  Its not as if tehre is not enough to do in EQ.  Of it was easy to get to the top it would cause 2 problems.  One, there would not be much of an accomplishment, and two we wouyld all be 60th level and wondering what to do next.<P>On Camping vs "Playing The right Way"<P>I think everyone has lost sight of the bif picture.  For the bennifit of people in that charatgory, here is the big pucture:<P>EverQuest was a big step forward in online RPGs.  They made a fun great game.  Did they make an mistakes?  Sure.  The biggest being the static spawns and required grouping.  Changing those features would be essentually be like rewriiting the entire game and that is not going to happen.  So lets just accept that (like everything) EQ is not perfect and enjoy it for what it is.  Other games (including EQ 2) will learn from these mistakes and be even beter.<P>Last Point:<P>I am sick of people saying that Verant is evil.  Lets face it there are only two evil companies in the world:  Exxon and Wizrds of the Coast (I am still made about them re-releasing rare out of print cards making my colelctionw wortheless).  Seriously, like any company Verant is making the best product they can in hopes we will apy for it.  If they dont make the product that you want to play that does not make them cocky or evil.  It simply means that your tastes dont match what they are making.  I hate mint chocklote chip Ice Cream but I dnt think Dreyers Co. has some conspiriousy against me.  I just choose not to buy it.<P>It may seem sometimes like Verant is heavy handed with their customer service policy but beleive me, you have to be or the whinny bitches on the boards (.001% of people playing) would eat them alive).  At first they really tries being reasonable and commucicative with the fans on teh Internet and they were treated like shit by people with no perspective and I am sure they made a decision to be more forecefull understanding that will hopfully just make the whinny bitches just go away for the beterment of us all.<P>Sorry. I just needed to get that off my chest.<BR></FONT>
