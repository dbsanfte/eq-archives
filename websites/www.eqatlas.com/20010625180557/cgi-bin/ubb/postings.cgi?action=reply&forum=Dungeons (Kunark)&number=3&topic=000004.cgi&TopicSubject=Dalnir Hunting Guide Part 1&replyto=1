Many of the coerced have damage shields too.  Be careful with the people who attack fast (especially if you're a monk dual wielding batons and you have a haste spell on you...)

Some of the Kly have AoE spells.  If you think you may need the help, move towards the MoBs who don't aggro on you.  If the Kly cast an AoE spell, it'll pull the other mobs into attacking it.

Before venturing in, buff up your poison and magic resistance.  The goos will poison you with the hits, and the only other mobs in the dungeon that don't cast are the Nibblers.[/B][/QUOTE]

Well, now that I have forums, here goes...  Feel free to add/comment to what I've written, or to post your own strategy guides here as well.<P>This is the first part of a (hopefully) two-part strategy guide to hunting in Dalnir.  This part will focus on general hunting-in-Dalnir issues, the second part on specific areas in the dungeon.  I chose Dalnir because I frequently see it underutilized, and when it is it's usually by two groups hanging out by the front door like a bunch of chickens.<P>Basic Concepts:<BR>1) Dalnir is a "do-able" dungeon.  What this means is that many of the creatures in a given area are of relatively the same level and strength.  If you can fight in the front hallway without having to zone every other battle, chances are you can fight anywhere on the first two levels of the dungeon.  The difficulty gets slightly higher as you move through, with areas of third level actually easier than on the second, however the exit on the third level is surrounded by the toughest critters in the zone, making escape not as safe as on level two.<P>2) Many MOB's in Dalnir are non-aggro.  This is a benefit to you if you are careful.  A typical example is the following, your group is hunting in L room on level one.  There is a MOB by the door (where you are camped) and three that spawn in the back.  From here you can pull from outside pretty steadily.  Many goos and nibblers are non-aggro, which means that even if you sit down to meditate, they won't attack you.  In the L room, we frequently do not attack non-aggro mobs to leave the room as a safe area, where we can rest and do everything without fear.  If you come in and there are some aggro mobs, kill them off and keep doing so until some non-aggro ones spawn.  This concept is key for moving around and clearing areas in the first two levels.  If they don't attack you, praise Bristlebane and move on.<P>3) Coerced.  A few pointers on the coerced creatures.  First of all, all of them except the goblins and the iksar are considered "summoned" creatures.  Clerics and druids, brush off those spells.<P>Second, be careful of how many of these you pull.  Since many of them are casters, they can really make a battle go sour if you get the wrong kind.  My least favorite is the annoying female gnome magician with her earth elemental pet.  Try and pull to your group when you wind up rooted by some damn elemental, and you'll see what I mean.  Harm Touch from SK's and the bad DoT's from the necros can really make your night go bad. Some of the healers (since NPC's seemingly can't be interrupted) can take like 5 minutes to polish off.  Take them one at a time if you can.<P>Many of the good drops in the zone come off of random little coerced creatures.  There is no way to predict where a specific coerced will spawn, but you can tell which ones will drop which items.  For instance, the Charred Tulwar drops off of a male DE that looks like a newbie.  The Tower Guard's Blade drops off of a (male?) Erudite in Banded type armor.  You'll learn them, but since you can't predict or control their spawns, it's more out of interest sake.<P>4) Crowd Control is priceless.  This is true in pretty much any dungeon, but is very true here.  The most successful groups I've had by far are those with an enchanter (thanks Sanelr and Vivix!) or a good bard (rare).  This is even more true when doing things like camping the Imp room on level two, for instance, where it has three fairly fast spawns before the Imp spawns, as well as spawns outside the room, so a group can get really hurt really fast without some way to pace battles.<P>5) Know where your exits are.  I think lots of people are afraid that the exits are hard to get to or something, and so won't go down to lower levels and stick by the front zone.  The exit on the second level is the easiest thing in the world to get to (unless you meet my favorite coerced), the one on the third is a bit harder because it's like running over a long stretch of hot coals with gasoline on your feet, but still pretty easy to do.  You can camp one of these exits just as easily as you do the ones on lvl 1.<P>6) Pits are a way of life in Dalnir.  It is up to you if you want to use levitate or not.  The worst fall is about 280 hps that I've seen, although be aware that the falling bug for 10k hps of damage will really mess you up.  The only times I've seen this happen are when people who are freefalling get caught on top of people who are levitating and then drop off of them.  Let the freefallers go first.  I honestly find levitate to be a pain, since you're likely juggling invis'ing everyone to go down without getting swarmed, and coordinating all that casting for a group is hard.<P>7)  Monk Heaven.  Few places in the game have the same amount of loot for monks as here.  They have crescent armor here for them, as well as some of the great monk weapons come out of here.  Plus, feign pulling is super handy in this zone as a way around needing crowd control (above).<P>8)  Don't be afraid to move in.  I've stated it above, but I'll state it more here.  Any group made up of 6 lvl 30's (on average) can take any room on the first two levels.  If you are well-balanced and have a monk and enchanter, you can do so practically without fear of death.<P>9)  Be nice to others here.  Many times I've entered, people have been very rude to others in the dungeon, I think cuz they are worried we're going to steal their Lumpy or something.  Give it a rest.  A lot of the good stuff for various classes is No Drop, so say if a piece of Crescent drops, let everyone know it's there so some monk can come get it.  Same holds true for the other quest items off of the Imprecators.  It pays off later when you are looking for a group in the zone, and I've made many friends while hunting there.<P>Oh well, I think that's all my advice.  If I think of more I'll add it in, and feel free to add to this.  Hopefully in the next few days I'll add in some more info about specific parts of the dungeon.<P>Die, Kly, Die!!<P>------------------<BR>Muse<BR>Bard and Cartographer</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Fristol</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Some additional info:<P>Only gyrating goos won't aggro on you.

There are a couple of clarifications needed though. <BR>    First, crowd control is essential, not an optional, part of being successful deeper in the dungeon. If you don't have an enchanter in your party or the aforementioned good Bard it is quite risky to go deeper in Dalnir. <BR>    The second part is that you need to be able to have confidence in your group. If you work well together you can prosper but if a mistake is made it can easily result in total party wipeout, with more deaths as you try to get back in to your corpses and retrieve your stuff. Move as a group and be prepared to leave as a group if someone has to go. It is no fun to have to wait around the entrance for 3 hours until a high level player can get there to escort you to your body and out.<BR>     As a final note: if you count on invis to scout places out DON'T drop down to the 3rd level unless you have both reg invis and invis to undead up. The Undead Blacksmith can see through reg invis and spawns close enough to the entry room in 3rd floor that he can aggro you. You are then in a world of hurt.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Lyzandia</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I have been doing Dalnir's since before they took out the Necklace of Superiority, and I have to say that this is a great post. Lots of good info.<BR>BUT, as a level 30 bard, what suggestions would you have for being "good" at crowd control?  I can think of a few things.  "Charm", but I usually end up dead when the mob breaks charm and aggros me.  "Lullaby", not usually very helpful, too often resisted.  "Pixie Strike", Mez's, but not for long, and builds up aggro pretty quick. <BR>BTW, my CHAR without adding a stein or something is 120.<BR>Would love any advice,<BR>Lyz</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Muse</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Just a change on the above:  the coerced have recently been changed so that they no longer count as "summoned" creatures.
