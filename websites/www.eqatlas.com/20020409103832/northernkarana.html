      <h3> <font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      The Northern Plains of Karana consist of a small but dangerous area in the 
      middle of the vast Plains of Karana. It is also the hub of most of the traffic 
      on the western half of the continent, as it marks the area where the bridges 
      from the east and south pass over the river that marks two of its borders. 
      <h3> <font size=+2>D</font>angers</h3>
      Can you say dangerous? This zone is almost painfully dangerous, and the 
      largest reason is that it has very high level, powerful, aggressive creatures 
      that roam the entire thing. Hill Giants and the Griffins all fit into this 
      category, and you can't even think of taking on the lowest level Griffawn 
      until at least 14th level, and even then I don't know. Once my 10th level 
      Ranger and my friend's 10th level Warrior met a gamble griffawn that attacked 
      us. I think I kicked it once for 3 points of damage before my friend was 
      killed. Needless to say, they are very powerful and should be avoided. The 
      guards at the lone tower are the most overworked guards in the game, and 
      its not uncommon to see one of them at half health... 
      <p>Given that the above is true, hunting in this area is very dangerous, 
        although it can be quite lucrative. If you know how to hunt, and by that 
        I mean to pull creatures to the zones edges and use your far distance 
        view to keep an eye on what's coming, you can actually do quite well fighting 
        the many types of beetles at lower levels. Like I said, though, hill giants 
        are fast and can spawn practically on top of you, and the run from Qeynos 
        is long... 
      <h3> <font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>
      <p>The largest benefit in this area is the high-level hunting it affords. 
        Well-coordinated groups of 15th level and higher (usually low 20's) can 
        make quite a bit of money and experience in this area, travelling and 
        killing off Griffins. </p>
      <p>It is possible to bind in the gypsy camp here as well, making the trip 
        for melee-types a bit better.</p>
      <p>There are also some items to be had in this area which are unique on 
        this half of the continent. The only place to get combine weapons on the 
        western half of Antonica (other than Rathe Mountians) lies within the 
        Northern Plains. Also, there is a good chance that werewolves can be found 
        in the northern part of the zone next to the mountains where the Fangbreakers 
        roam, providing all of their associated items as well. There is also a 
        merchant who sells high level Druid spells, as well as a trainer for Druids 
        near the eastern bend of the river. 
      <h3> <font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
        <font size=+2>N</font>orthern <font size=+2>P</font>lains of <font size=+2>K</font>arana</h3>
      The western border marks the vast edge with the Western Plains of Karana. 
      Travelling that way leads eventually to the cities of Erudin, Qeynos, and 
      Halas. 
      <p>The southern and eastern edges of the zone are bordered by an impassable 
        river. The only ways across it are two bridges. The southern bridge leads 
        into the Southern Plains of Karana, and is guarded by the Qeynos Guard. 
      <p>The eastern bridge is a vast wooden structure, rumored to have been built 
        by the hill giants, that passes over the eastern stretch of the river. 
        Nobody guards this bridge.
