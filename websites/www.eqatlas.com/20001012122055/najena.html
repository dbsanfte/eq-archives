      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      <p>Najena is the ancient home of a twisted dark elf magician named Najena, 
        who carved out this hole in the hidden areas of the Lavastorm Mountains 
        in which to carry out her experiments, as well as those of her allies. 
        The undead walk the halls as if it is home. 
      <h3><font size=+2>B</font>asic Zone Information</h3>
      <p>Najena is a place filled with undead of various types. The rooms are 
        packed with them, with typically four skeletons of various types lying 
        on the floor of any given room. Added to this are aggressive earth elementals 
        and ogre guards, all of whom will attack on sight. For adventurers in 
        the lower level ranges listed above (below 17th level or so), travelling 
        in a group should be the rule, as simply walking in a room can result 
        in four creatures jumping you at once. Once you've hit 17th, only the 
        occasional Darkbone Skeleton will attack. For lower level adventurers, 
        hunting in the front rooms and attacking the creatures that are there 
        should provide enough excitement. 
      <h3><font size=+2>A</font>dvanced Zone Information</h3>
      <p>For higher level adventurers or groups, the zone is much more interesting 
        than trying to fight off swarms of skeletons. There are several areas 
        of interest. First of all, there is a whole key system to the lair of 
        Najena. Various creatures and NPC's carry the keys to access other areas 
        within the lair. I will use the keys to describe how to move through the 
        zone. The ogre guards and Moosh carry a key ring, which will give you 
        access to the prison cells. One note on Moosh, attacking him in the prison 
        itself will make the injured halfling join in against you, although when 
        you kill him you take hits with all the Rivervale factions. This is especially 
        a pain because Moosh will stupidly attack people way above his level, 
        so even hanging out in there is a bad idea for reasons of faction. The 
        first monster in the key sequence is Bonecracker. Bonecracker is an approximately 
        level 25 undead froglok who lives in a room with two lovely dark elf necromancers. 
        He also spawns the Barbed Leather Whip and Leering Mask occasionally, 
        and he himself spawns every 20 minutes. He gives you the dull bone key. 
        The ogre captain must then be killed to get the shiny metal key. These 
        first two keys are the only keys that aren't No Rent (i.e. they won't 
        disappear when you log) so hang onto them.
      <p>The shiny metal key is then used to open the cell outside of Rathyl's 
        room. The dull bone key is then used to access Rathyl's area, where you 
        can fight Rathyl. Note you need both keys to get to Rathyl. Killing him 
        will give you access to the bloodstained key for Drelzna's room, as well 
        as possibly the Traveller's Pouch or Pack. He then reincarnates (as Rathyl 
        reincarnate) and sometimes has the Hollowed Bone Bracers as loot. Then 
        you can access Drelzna's room, who is slightly higher level, and used 
        to spawn the Journeyman Boots (but not any more)... Now you can get the 
        Ashenwood Short Spear there. Getting the golden crescent key from Drelzna 
        will allow you to access the room with Najena herself, who is about 29th 
        level or so and has several high level protectors. She spawns the Flowing 
        Black Robe and the Black Tome with Silver Runes. Also new to the area 
        is a Widow Mistress, who drops the Stiletto of the Blood Claw, and appears 
        near the spiders in the caves beyond the underwater tunnel to Najena's 
        room.. 
      <p>There is also a prison area, which the intrepid explorer can find himself 
        trapped in by falling through one of two pit traps located in the upper 
        level. There is a damsel in distress here, as well as an injured halfling 
        who won't talk to anyone, but, as mentioned above, will rush to the aid 
        of his ogre guard for no apparent reason. 
      <h3><font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
        <font size=+2>N</font>ajena</h3>
      <p>The entrance to Najena lies in the southeastern corner of the Lavastorm 
        Mountains. It is impossible to miss, as it consists of a huge set of double 
        doors, with one blown off its hinges from some unknown force within.
