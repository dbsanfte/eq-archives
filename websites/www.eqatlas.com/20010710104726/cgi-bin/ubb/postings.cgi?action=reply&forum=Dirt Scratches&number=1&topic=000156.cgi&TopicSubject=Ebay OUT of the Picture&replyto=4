Well in my searches of the internet to find a new place to sell items... I found one and I am realy glad I did.  Not only can you buy sell and trade... The listing fee is FREE... and the costs are half that of ebay's selling costs.  I am putting all the items I had on ebay right straight to this site.

Now this guy is telling them where they can sell it for real cash which will only draw more of those types to the spawns where perhaps someone wants to fight for EXP and not just get that rare spawn item. Anyway i also believe that selling these items over the internet for REAL money is lame your taking an aspect of the game and putting it outside of the game. If people are so addicted to EQ that they cant go out and get a job and they have to make thier money from EQ they need to go to EQ annonymous. Keep it in the game thats were it should be, you can still make boku plats and buy cool items instead of spending the real money on cigerettes or coffee to stay up a week straight on EQ.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Lejax</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I will never understand buying in-game items for real money.<P>I pay Verant almost ten bucks a month to play the game.  I get good items by playing the game.  That's how one gets good items - by playing the game.<P>This is how it works for everyone.  Other people get good items by playing the game too.<P>If you pay other people RL money for items they got by playing the game, you are paying to have them play for you.<P>In other words, <B>you are paying to NOT play the game.</B><P>How can that possibly be <I>fun?</I><P>I can see many reasons to want to <I>sell</I> in-game items for RL money.  But I can't think of a single rational reason to <I>buy</I> them for RL money.<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Amused</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Aside from the fact that each time you auction/buy something out of EQ, you actually violate a contract (the license agreement you agree to everytime you enter the game),  this is just so hilarious and stupid.<BR>The losers are not really those who auction;  the losers are those, who actually BUY the little piece of code (item) for RL Dollars!<BR>Tell me this:  if you were to play Monopoly with your family, and you were to be in risk of losing the game because you happen to be broke,  would you rush to your neighbor's house and offer $ 50 or $ 100 for a stack of the high number purple bills??<BR>Where does idiocy stop these days?<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">gottoloveit</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I have ebayed stuff....fbss, jade mace,10k....total cost $220.00. I understand Verant's position on selling. They don't want someone else profiting by from the game. They desire to be the sole proprieters and rightly so. But, the idea camping will stop with selling is ridiculous. The stuff will just be at the tunnel of Lag in EC selling for plat instead of cash. The idea of illegality is also pretty lame, ever copy software? Ever copy a tape or download from napster? Have any games on your computer you didnt pay for? Ever turn right on red without coming to a complete stop? OMG the horror of it. Get real, how many people read those licences anyway. The idea of buying code, is that so wierd i mean you did buy the game right? I just bought an upgrade. rankly it's a bit easier to get a group as a melee with good equipment anyway. So you don't want to twink grest for you, you want to twink an alt great for you, you want to camp stuff and sell for pp great for you, you want to camp stuff to get it great for you. Now ther isnt much camping to sell anymore but..........there is still so much camping.........guess it wasnt ebay that kept those Ubers at the MOB after all huh? A lot more people selling in EC than Ebay if you havent noticed. Camping is here to stay Ebay or not. Only No drop will stop that and then there will be no economy at all. I hate selling in that godforsaken tunnel thanks to Ebay i can be generous now and sell cheap to rid myself of the wieght. I dont have to sit in a tunnel of chat lag trying to get the best possible price. I have payed to play more not less</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Cressida</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Um, I didn`t even know that selling game stuff in real life was possible.  Learn a new thing every day.  I`d first have to wonder what kind of person has the time to do something like that.  Oh, unless you spend so much time on EQ trying to get items to re-sell in real time that you lost your job? Just teasing..hehe... But seriously, doesn`t that defeat the purpose of finding it in game, completing the quests, and networking in game to trade?  So in effect, you`re not really playing the game at all?<BR>And yes, people who give stuff from their high level characters to their low level characters are committing an act of twinkery.  Its called power-gaming, no one likes them in table-top, no one likes them in live-action, and no one likes them in EQ.  Now having said that, everyone has also DONE it at some point.  Its the extent that you do it that makes the real difference I think.  As long as you don`t claim to be a role-playing character, power-game away, I don`t care.  Just don`t paint your name in purple and then get your level 50 to hand you down a funky set of armor.  That ISN`T role-playing.<BR>Cressida &lt;Keepers of the Fiery Myste&gt;</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">ShanterDG113</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I can understand folks being upset by campers for cash.  You want your chance at the area or item, but selling for cash or PP... its pretty much the same, except that PP can only be spent in game.<P>As for not understanding why one would pay for these items, I think its probably because not everyone enjoys the slow pace of EQ after level 13 or so.  I pesonally don't have a lot of time to play, and the "friends" I make online advance so quickly in level that I only end up playing with them for a week or two before I'm just a liability to them.  So I twink to get the extra edge (nicely enough I have a generous patron who shares his hand me down gear with me).<P>Twinking allows me to play a little more agressively and adventure into areas that I would not get a chance to see.<P>Others may not have generous patrons or PP so they can pay with $$ for the items.  Not everyone has the time or desire to discover all the gear they want.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Killjoy</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">As long as their are dual-wielding Shaman orcs in highpass that can hit for 40 with a splintering club, then I'll twink.<P>The last time I checked, people played video games for fun.<P>Fun is really a subjective term.  To some people, fun is playing from scratch, with no cheats or trainers of any kind. That's fine. To some, fun is cruising through a game, laying waste to everything with total power and control over the situation. That's fine too. Others may find satisfaction in the fact they are getting a piece of "binary code" to sell.  Maybe this person isn't well off, and is using it to put a kid through school, or whatever.<P>The point is, it's not up to us to judge others.  Comments, thoughts, views: everyone is entitled to 'em  <IMG SRC="http://www.eqatlas.com/ubb/smile.gif">, but don't condem someone because they're not like you (either way).<P>I'm gonna go have fun. Are you?</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">btajesc</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">First of all I think this person is plugging their own site.<P>But anyway, I think the best reason not to allow the real world sale of game items is that it attrack cheaters,hackers,macroers, and exploiters.  And believe me, all of the above just ruins a game.  Ever played UO at its cheater/hacker prime? Or AC now?  If so you know what I mean.  When money is involved, it adds to the motivation to cheat.<BR></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
