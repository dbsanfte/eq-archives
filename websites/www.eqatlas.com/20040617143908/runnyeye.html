      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      <p>Runnyeye Citadel used to be the underground home of the Runnyeye clan 
        of Goblins. Their tunnels wind their way through the hills, carving deeper 
        and deeper down into the depths. Recently, however, the Pickclaw goblin 
        tribe has moved into and taken over the area, making prisoners of Clan 
        Runnyeye and their once leaders, the Evil Eyes.
      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>angers </h3>
      <p>This dungeon is one of the most confusing and twisted of all the dungeons. 
        Travelling through it requires a good sense of direction, because the 
        tunnel weaves and splits at many points throughout its journey. The upper 
        level is fairly straightforward, and inhabited by the lower level goblins 
        of the Citadel, including the occasional goblin worker, and are relatively 
        safe for the lower level adventurer. 
      <p>Lower down the dungeon becomes even more confusing, as many rooms have 
        multiple intersections with other rooms in the area, making it hard to 
        find your way to a point or away from a particularly nasty critter. Few 
        people travel deep into this dungeon without a strong group backing them 
        up. 
      <p>The inhabitants of the lower levels also make the area difficult to adventure 
        in. The Pickclaw goblins must spend a great deal of their time training 
        spellcasters among their ranks, since more than half of the monsters that 
        you will encounter deep down are some sort of shaman, with the occasional 
        wizard thrown in. Add this to the fact that they are only rarely found 
        by themselves, more commonly in groups of 3 or 4, make this area that 
        much more dangerous, and practically mandate hunting with a group. 
      <p>The most dangerous feature of the dungeon is, however, the evil eyes. 
        They are regularly found in the lower levels in various rooms, and can 
        be heard because they make a sick, sticky sound as their eye opens and 
        closes. They are much higher level than the local goblins, as well, so 
        you must keep your eyes peeled when hunting goblins that one of these 
        doesn't appear, because it's a long way to the top. Probably the most 
        dangerous behavior these creatures exhibit, however, is that they will 
        occasionally wander all the way to the top. I believe this happens when 
        they are trained up there from below, but they might well do this on their 
        own. For the lower level characters at the top of the dungeon, they are 
        very lethal. With only one spell, one of them killed my fully healed 10th 
        level ranger as he fled to the exit. If you ever see &quot;Evil eye begins 
        to cast a spell.&quot; in your chat window, my advice is to zone and zone 
        fast. 
      <h3><font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>
      <p>This zone is blessed with an abundance of goblins, which are separated 
        quite well by level between the various levels. The lower level goblins 
        (7th and 8th) live on the upper level and stay there, wandering back and 
        forth, and are usually not in groups so can be solo'ed well. The higher 
        level goblins are in the second level, and usually come in groups. This 
        means that they must be hunted in groups, but are separated into their 
        own rooms and so the pulls are fairly predictable. I've never seen a train 
        in Runnyeye like you would see in Blackburrow or some of the other places. 
      <p>There are also some neat items that can be found in this dungeon. The 
        throne room area has monsters that possess Blackened Alloy Armor, which 
        adds to stats, depending on the piece that you get, and looks very cool. 
        Blackened Iron and Blackened Alloy Armor are all pretty much random drops 
        off of creatures here (the Blackened Alloy coming off of higher level 
        ones) Also, the evil eyes are a big draw to this area, and the evil eye 
        that spawns the lens for the Staff of the Observer lives in this zone. 
      <p>Also, there is a bank in Runnyeye. Yes, a bank. You can go there, change 
        in coppers, and go hunting some more, although you have to be at least 
        level 30 so they are non-aggressive to you. Add to that the local merchants, 
        which sell food and other items, and you could stay here for a while. 
        Very cool... 
      <h3><font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
        <font size=+2>R</font>unnyeye <font size=+2>C</font>itadel</h3>
      <p>There are two entrances to Runneye, both of which are fairly close to 
        one another. The first entrance from Misty Thicket includes a long, relatively 
        safe, tunnel into the zone. Only very rarely do goblins venture down this 
        path. 
      <p>Keeping directly to the right will take you quickly to the entrance to 
        the Gorge of King Xorbb, which is readily identifiable by the stakes with 
        the human heads and the large &quot;Keep Out&quot; written in blood on 
        the wall opposite the entrance. This is a very quick escape from trains 
        who may happen to be following you from the second level...
