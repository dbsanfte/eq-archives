      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      <p>Cabilis, or New Sebilis, as it is often called, is the new heart of the 
        Iksar Empire. The Iksar recaptured the city long ago and have since made 
        it their new home. Their is an ongoing effort to tame the surrounding 
        areas to ensure the safety of the city.
      <h3><font size=+2>S</font>urrounding <font size=+2>A</font>reas</h3>
      <p>The Iksar have, for centuries now, focused internally on rebuilding their 
        culture and society, to be stronger and to be able to face the outside 
        world again. That time has come, and the Iksar are now pushing back into 
        the lands where they once ruled supreme. There are four areas immediately 
        surrounding the city that are of intense interest to the Iksar. First 
        is the Field of Bone, a barren area that contains the ancient remains 
        of Kurn's Tower and Kaesora. The Iksar are focusing many of their broodlings 
        in this area in order to tame it. The Swamp of No Hope is an area that 
        the Iksar currently are letting run wild, despite maintaining a small 
        outpost to protect their walls. Warsliks Wood is similar, as the Iksar 
        have met much resistance from both the goblins and the forest giants within 
        during their attempts to control the area. There is also a strong outcast 
        presense there. The Lake of Ill Omen, however, is another area that the 
        Iksar are very focused on regaining control over. A new enemy, the sarnak, 
        have established a fortress within this region and are expanding their 
        range slowly, coming into conflict with the residents of Cabilis and also 
        the goblins of the region.
      <p>To the south of the city lies Firiona Vie, the forest that held the elven 
        outpost named after their queen. This is an area of intense interest, 
        as there are rumors filtering into Cabilis that the elves have returned, 
        and have brought with them many other softflesh beings that had never 
        been seen before...
      <h3><font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
        <font size=+2>C</font>abilis</h3>
      <p>Cabilis can be reached from four separate directions. To the northeast 
        lies the Field of Bone. South of that lies the Swamp of No Hope. East 
        Cabilis holds the gates to these regions.
      <p>To the northwest lies Warsliks Woods. South of that is the Lake of Ill 
        Omen. The entrances to these areas lie within West Cabilis under jurisdiction 
        of the infamous Tower of Death.
      <h3><font size=+2>L</font>ocal <font size=+2>C</font>olor</h3>
      <p><b>Places</b> 
      <p>Cabilis is divided into two segments. East Cabilis is the cultural center 
        of the town. Within East Cabilis lie the guild halls for all but the necromancers. 
        It is also where the military leaders of the Iksar reside. The Haggle 
        Baron also works out of this region, in control of all the merchants in 
        this area.
      <p>West Cabilis is an entirely different world. The most prominent feature 
        of West Cabilis is the Tower of Death, the stronghold of the necromancers 
        of the Iksar people. All other Iksar fear the necromancers and leave them 
        alone, an arrangement that the necromancers are very happy with. Within 
        their tower they perform experiments and strengthen their Art and, through 
        that, all Iksar. Merchants in this area owe fealty to the Tower and not 
        to the Haggle Baron, so it is possible to find items here that the Haggle 
        Baron doesn't believe in.
      <p>In each of the surrounding areas, there are small outposts. These exist 
        in the ruins of ancient bazaars of the Iksar, now all buy destroyed. These 
        areas are patrolled by the Crusaders and Troopers of the city, and provide 
        some degree of safety and law in these wild lands.
      <p><b>People</b> 
      <p>The Iksar, although united in a common cause, show their history in their 
        leaders. All of the leaders of the various guilds are powerful personalities, 
        and constantly struggle between themselves for dominance in the city. 
        The Warlord of the Warrior Guild provides Troopers for the city guard, 
        and has developed a loose and uncertain alliance with the leaders of the 
        Tower of Death, whose silent presence provides him with more power. The 
        Lords of Pain and their Crusaders of Greenmist provide the other arm to 
        the defense of the city, and are allied to the Scaled Mystics through 
        their religion.
      <p>In the center of all this, Grand Master Glox sits, quietly, looking within. 
        His silence unnerves the other leaders, but they all realize that, when 
        he awakens, him and his Swifttails will likely lead their kind to retake 
        their ancient empire.
