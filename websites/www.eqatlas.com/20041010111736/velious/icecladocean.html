      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      <p>The Iceclad Ocean consists of two parts, the open ocean between it and 
        the other continents of Norrath, and Icy Fingers, a series of small fragmented 
        islands that lead to the continent of Velious itself. The Icy Fingers 
        have long been the home of outsiders to Velious, starting with the ancient 
        Tower of Frozen Shadow, up until now where the original gnomes who drove 
        Icebreaker here are now busy becoming pirates. This is also the home of 
        the Icepaw Gnolls, and one arm of the huge Graitspaign lies here.
      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>angers </h3>
      <p>The Iceclad Ocean's largest danger is the monsters that roam the islands, 
        but compared to other areas of Velious, they are not that dangerous. They 
        are typically spread out and easy to avoid. The largest problem is that 
        the islands have very steep sides to them, and this can cause you to not 
        see a monster until you are upon it. 
      <p>The portal spot here is also not very safe. People will often hang out 
        here or, even worse, pull to here. This means that when you appear in 
        the zone, fresh to the new continent, you stand a good chance of getting 
        jumped by some monster that was pulled here or just happened to wander 
        by. Be careful and be ready to run when you arrive.
      <p>Also, the Tower of Frozen Shadow lies in this zone. The evil from within 
        spills onto the surface of the Icy Fingers on which it stands, and the 
        guardians of the tower are more aggressive than the other creatures in 
        the zone. 
      <p>There are also two dangerous creatures of note, both of which appear 
        on the island with the Tower (typically). The first is Lodizal, a very 
        powerful turtle who is aggressive to everyone. The second is Garou, a 
        rarely seen but very dangerous foe.
      <h3><font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>
      <p>Iceclad Ocean is largely known as a transit zone between the continent 
        of Velious and the other continents of Norrath. Wizards and Druids can 
        port to within this zone, very near to the bridge to the rest of Velious. 
        Also, melee types can be bound at the dock located here.
      <p>This area provides very good hunting that is also relatively safe. The 
        cougars are what most people hunt, and are aggressive but not immediately, 
        and are generally not mixed in with aggressive creatures. The monsters 
        are also a bit more spread out in Iceclad, making hunting generally safer. 
      <h3><font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
        <font size=+2>I</font>ceclad <font size=+2>O</font>cean</h3>
      <p>The most common way to reach Iceclad Ocean is via the boat from the Northern 
        Desert of Ro. The boat lands at an island at 4000, -20,200 in the Ocean 
        and the traveller must go over that island and take the Icebreaker to 
        one of the main islands in order to reach the mainland.
      <p>The Druid and Wizard teleport spells both carry travellers to the loc 
        -630, 4925. 
      <p>The Eastern Wastes are adjacent to the Iceclad Ocean and can be reached 
        by travelling over the Graitspaigne, or Great Span, a large visible bridge 
        that goes from the largest Icy Finger to the mainland. The loc of the 
        base of this is -4400, 8900.
      <p>The Tower of Frozen Shadow is located at the loc -2500, 3000.
