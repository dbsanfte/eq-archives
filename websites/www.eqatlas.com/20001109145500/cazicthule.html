      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      <p>The Lost Temple of Cazic-Thule lies deep in the swamps in the south of 
        Antonica, hidden on an island beneath vines and protected by its caretakers 
        and worshippers, the lizard men. Within the temple exists a thriving community 
        of lizard men and priests of Cazic-Thule.
      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>angers </h3>
      <p>Cazic-Thule is a dungeon like all others, with bodies littering the front 
        entrance and people shouting &quot;train!&quot; Unlike many other dungeons, 
        however, the trains are the least of your concerns, depending on where 
        you are hunting. The dungeon is set up in many small out-of-the-way places 
        with narrow escape routes, so most people, even if they wanted to run, 
        couldn't. What this means is that, although there are trains, they are 
        usually from the areas closest to the entrance, and don't come from the 
        far corners of the dungeon. For people hunting in the courtyard, this 
        is a problem, since the train will either jump the tracks and attack them, 
        or will attack them on its way back through to home. It is also the reason 
        that my level above states 20th as the lowest level, even though the front 
        hallway has lizards that are around 10th level in it. These trains kill 
        everything in their path.
      <p>That being said, trains are not as much of a danger as are the creatures 
        that inhabit the dungeon. You must fight everywhere in a group. Period. 
        The lizards will all help each other, and many of them are healer-types 
        with cleric spells, and they all hang out next to each other. This means 
        that it's nearly impossible to pull just one lizard; it is possible, but 
        you can't rely on being able to do that all the time. This problem is 
        exacerbated in areas like the courtyard and throne room, because there 
        is so much local traffic of lizards that one pull can result in many many 
        lizards fighting you. For this reason, I personally never hunt in the 
        courtyard, and if I did my rule would be to zone early and fast if there 
        is any doubt in my mind we've bitten off more than we can chew, simply 
        because we always seem to pick up some stragglers.
      <p>The rare spawns (the ones everyone camps) basically have an exaggerated 
        version of this problem going on with them. They tend to spawn in areas 
        that are swarming with other lizards (&quot;conveniently&quot; the healing 
        types) and they tend to spawn simultaneously with those lizards. Be sure 
        to keep the local area clear when hunting the rare spawns, as every lizard 
        nearby will join in if you fight one, and lizards hit hard (at least they 
        hit my druid hard).
      <p>An annoyance of the zone is that it is heavily camped, probably the most 
        heavily camped dungeon for mid-level characters if they're not in Lower 
        Guk. Since a large amount of the wealth in terms of items in this zone 
        comes off of relatively few creatures, all of whom seem to have very long 
        spawn times, this zone tends to bring out the worst in people playing.
      <h3><font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>
      <p>This dungeon, as dangerous as it is, is probably one of the best places 
        in the game to gain both experience and wealth, providing you have a good 
        group in which to do it. It's commonly described as a good place to gain 
        a lot of experience, and a good place to lose a lot of experience, so 
        hunt here wisely. The items that you gain here are all worth a fair amount 
        of cash, and there is a huge market for Lizardscale equipment.
      <p>One of the other benefits applies to the evil races only. Many of the 
        lizards drop fine steel weapons which most characters can't carry back 
        to their respective cities or merchants to sell. Evil characters can buy 
        these weapons and resell them and make a fair profit in the meantime, 
        shuttling weapons from Cazic-Thule to the merchants outside of Oggok.
      <h3><font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
        <font size=+2>C</font>azic-<font size=+2>T</font>hule</h3>
      <p>Cazic-Thule can be found in the swamps of the Feerott, home of the ogres. 
        Travelling from the west (Rathe Mountains) leads you to the west side 
        of the swamp. From there head to the southeast keeping your eyes peeled 
        for the local Bouncers and you will hit a river. Swim the river and head 
        south on the island, you can't miss the temple as it makes up the whole 
        of the south end of the island. Do not travel along the edge, as you will 
        pass very near the spectre cave, which can be deadly...
      <p>From the east (Innothule Swamp) you should turn left upon entering the 
        zone and follow the border around to the river, swim it, and you will 
        run along the wall of the temple to the entrance. This path is safer, 
        but the Bouncers can occasionally be seen wandering even this far out. 
        Be careful...
