<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by TornAsunder:
[B]k3wl dOOd$ came from Ultima Online really.(Hereafter refered to as UO) See, in UO you could make your name something like this... bUnGWiPpErBoY. Most of these little jerks were really obnoxious little punks with far too much time on their hands are far too little parental supervision. Most would run around and say things like Wow, and Kewel, and might be all of 12 years old and just useless little zit faced jerks. 

I think the 1st way I really saw the name best was like this, and this was a real players name on the Baja Server in UO. KeWeLdOOd was his name. He was a Player Killer. Player Killers used add on programs to powerlevel their characters up to max stats in just a matter of days, and farther used those programs to kill other players very fast. 

I became an Anti-Player Killer there because I just got sick of the little KeWeldOOd$ running the roost. I made a character called Mistress of Pain, and used the same tactics they did and same add on programs. I only killed PKers however. I became quite wealthy in game from it and pissed off more than a few KeWeLdOOds.

So, to make the point, a k3wl dOOd$ is just a useless child who really needs to be studying for school rather than playing online games because they really have mental problems and need to get a life.

Brings me to eBay Farmers. They are Powergamers that start an account, get the character up to like 50th level as fast as they can in order to auction it on eBay. Farmers are really just KeWeLdOOds that came from UO and Diablo and just grew up playing online games and some saw a way to make some money out of it. You are right, if Varant really wanted to stop farmers they could, but hell, it just means more money to then in the long run also, so why stop it.

What doe these terms mean?<P>ebay farmers/ebayers<BR>powerlamers<BR>dupe bugs<BR>k3wl dOOd$<BR>showeq users<P>Thanks in advance!<BR><P>------------------<BR>I am me,<BR>  <BR>Aieee!</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Oakao</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This is my guess:<P>ebay farmers/ebayers - a character that was part of an accout sold on eBay. Apparently this isn't the most honest group to del with. You get ripped off if they have Verant set the password back. Also you get banned if discovered. It is a way to get a jump start to a higher level. So someone with no EQ playing experience has a high level char but doesn't know how to play it well.<P>powerlamers - ?<P>dupe bugs - an error in the progam that lets you make two out of somethng you have one of (Duplicate). If you find a bug like this Verant has ofered a reward for reporting it.<P>k3wl dOOd$ - cool dude (3 look like backward Es)<BR>showeq users - I think someone hacked the eq files so they could make a private server with no life. This allows them to learn the lay of the zone before playing there for real. That program whould be called ShowEQ</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Lothiel Anderwynd</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Although I've never used it, I think ShowEQ is much more powerful that just that. I think it gives Real-time data that the user shouldn't inherently know. <P>One example: I heard that during the recent Mithaniel Marr/Tunare Split, people were able to tell how many times the /movelog yes command was entered. All hearsay, of course.<P>Powerlamers is just a more derogatory version of powergamers. These are people who spend nearly all of their time leveling up. They do so by going to particular camps where the experience can come in a hurry, and they don't worry too much about questing, role playing, or interacting with the EQ Community. These are the people that can get from level 1 to level 50 in a matter of a few short weeks.<P>They don't get a lot of sleep.   <IMG SRC="http://www.eqatlas.com/ubb/smile.gif"><p>[This message has been edited by Lothiel Anderwynd (edited 10-11-2000).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Aieee!</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Thanks for the help!  I cannot for the life of me conceive fo going from lv1 to lv50 is a few months, much less a few weeks.  but I guess there are those who can.<P>Thre are people who sell thier accounts on eBay?  If Verant considers this bannable, then how do people get away with htis?  It seems awfully simplpe for Verant to detect:<P>"Hi Verant?  Yeah, it's me, John Doe.  Tell you what, I've changed my email address, my home address, my charge account number, and my name is noy Nancy Middlebrockenheimerschmidt.  But I'm still the same person.  Oh, by the way, I need to set up a new account under my old name and demographic info"  &lt;shrug&gt;  Seems like Verant could squash this is they really wante to.<P>As fo K3wl dOOdz.

K3wl D00d$ are the guys who NEVER role play, type with two fingers, and use two word sentences to describe everything (Kewl dood being their favorite). Tehy also happen to be the ones who are most likely to be farmers, ebayers, and powergamers...<P>The only new derrogatory name that has emerged is "powerlamers" because they are the ones that come just to power level (i.e. powergamers) and have no idea what cooperation or Role Playing actually is... These are the people who will usually play solo (usually with either a necro or a druid), and then after level 20 will have problems finding groups (or refuse to find one), so they camp a single spawn for hours on end or become item farmers... <P></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">TornAsunder</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">k3wl dOOd$ came from Ultima Online really.(Hereafter refered to as UO) See, in UO you could make your name something like this... bUnGWiPpErBoY.
