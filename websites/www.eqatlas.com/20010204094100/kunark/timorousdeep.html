      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      <p>The Timorous Deep is the name of the ocean that lies between Kunark and 
        the other continents of Norrath. The Deep is dotted with islands that 
        stretch across it, and these islands contain a mixture of the modern powers 
        on Norrath, those that have fallen out of their societies, natural predators, 
        and ancient civilizations.
      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>angers </h3>
      <p>The Deep is separated into many separate islands, some of which are much 
        more dangerous than others. Probably the most dangerous island is the 
        Raptor islands. The raptors that live on these are very powerful (mid-40's 
        in level) and very aggressive, with huge aggro ranges, and it seems that 
        if you can even see one it will attack you once you step foot on the island. 
        Apparently, their clawed feet are also webbed, and they can swim faster 
        than you as well.
      <p>The other aggressive creatures are the powerful golras on the iceberg. 
        These are around mid-20th in level, but occasionally a much more powerful 
        golra named Halara appears here. All the golras are aggressive to everybody. 
        There is also a powerful aggressive ogre that appears in the ogre encampment 
        named the Great Oowomp, who can wreak havoc with any group hunting ogres 
        and unlucky enough to pull him as well.
      <p>There is also a dragon that frequents the southwestern corner of the 
        Deep around the Combine Teleportation Room. This dragon is aggressive 
        and found in the water, and as powerful as Nagafen. This makes him very 
        difficult to kill and almost impossible to avoid.
      <p>The other creatures in the zone are also aggressive, like the bandits, 
        the undead, and the ogres and elves to those with bad faction with them, 
        and all these creatures will group together. The Spirocs will also group 
        together and fight, and are as powerful as the raptors, although less 
        aggressive.
      <p>Timorous Deep is also a place that one can easily get lost in. There 
        are vast stretches of nothing but water, and either knowing how to use 
        the /loc command or sensing headings can make up a lot of potentially 
        lost time. This zone is also difficult to hunt in since no classes, not 
        even casters, are allowed to bind within the zone. Since the boats running 
        into the Deep aren't known for their speed, and there is no way to teleport 
        in, everyone gets to deal with the long run after their body if they die.
      <h3><font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>
      <p>Timorous Deep has very good hunting for a wide range of people, and most 
        of the places to hunt are relatively untouched by hordes of other players. 
        This means that at most times it's possible to find a place to hunt in 
        the Deep where you won't be fighting someone for this. The exception to 
        this is probably the ogre camp, which is pretty busy of late.
      <p>The Deep is also one of the areas in the game where many people have 
        never seen. There are some nice sites to see in the zone, and it is very 
        fun to explore. One of the nicest sites is the Inn hidden away in the 
        southermost edge of the Deep, likely the old hideaway for some hermit.
      <p>There is, way in the southwestern corner of the zone, an underwater portal 
        room that lies through a small tunnel on the ocean bed in the midst of 
        a Combine Teleportation Ring. There are fire pots in this room that will 
        teleport you one way to many of the cities of Norrath (excepting most 
        human cities).

        <font size=+2>T</font>imorous <font size=+2>D</font>eep</h3>
      <p>The Timorous Deep lies on a trade route and transport route between Kunark 
        and the other continents. As such, it has many connections. Refer to the 
        <a href="boattravel.html">Kunark Boat Travel Guide</a> for more information. 
      <p>There is also a teleportation room that is located within the Timorous 
        Deep, with which you can teleport to several of the major cities within 
        the world. A description of this room can be found at the <a href="timorousteleport.html">Timorous 
        Deep Teleportation Room Guide</a>.
