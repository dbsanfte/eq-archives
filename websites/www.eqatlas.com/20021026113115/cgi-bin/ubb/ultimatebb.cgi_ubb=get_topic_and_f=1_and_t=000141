Here's a repost from my main page about my initial assessment of Velious:<P>Also, I just wanted to comment now after having played in Velious for five days. I really think Verant has done a wonderful job with the new continent, this is what Everquest should have been when it came out. The whole continent is filled with quests, all the monsters drop cool stuff, the factions play a huge role, and when you're there you are really aware of a large purpose to it all.<P>There are two downsides to it, though. The first is that the continent is a high-level playground. It's a known fact that you will have to be in a large guild to do a lot of the quests here, much less even make it alive to many of the zones. I think this is bad, and I wish they had this much depth built in for lower level characters.<P>The other downside is that the high-level characters aren't moving along to their zones. Last night I figured I'd go check out Crystal Caverns or Tower of Frozen Shadow to see if I could get in a pickup group with my lvl 35 druid. I had similar experiences in both. I walk in, monsters are all blue to me, do a /who and there are about 30 people in each zone. Great! Wait a second... not one of these people is less than 45th level! The Tower did not have one living creature on the first level for me to even see, much less attack.<P>The point is, the game of EQ has gotten better, but it's still played by the same people. I applaud the higher-levels who have the balls to go fight and die in Velketor's or in Kael or in Cobalt Scar. That's where you're supposed to be. For the rest of you, realize that the cooler equipment that you get in the higher level areas will let you buy whatever you want from these dungeons with money to spare, and you might actually get some exp and others might actually enjoy those dungeons (the Tower, for instance, was built to be "done" by a mid-30's group). For you lower level people who are in Velious, start moving in and using these places, invoke the Fair Play rules and kick their asses out.<P>------------------<BR>Muse<BR>Bard and Cartographer

 First, excuse my poor english as it's not my native language (i am from France).<BR> I received SoV yesterday afternoon and didn't get any sleep yet (8am) as i spent the whole night on that new continent =). I play a level 55 mage, in a rather small guild (12 people 50+). I hope i will make you understand why you will find high levels in zones where most creatures are green..<BR> Except for two people from quebec and two american people, i was the first in my guild to get SoV as it is distibuted a bit later in Europe and my guild is mainly european. After having installed the extension and run the patch, i logged on and found a GG to Ice Clad. I ventured in the outdoors, not knowing much of SoV as i tried to avoid all the spoiler sites so far. I found pretty fast the bridge to EW and then the frozen tower. All the mobs i met were green. I left the tower and was heading to EW when an old friend told me to come along with him to the frozen tower.. I went there, he had several keys and we made our way to the fifth level (wedding ceremony) and camped the mobs there. Exploring a new dungeon, even a green one, was really fun, but not very challenging indeed. After a few hours i got bored and when my friend logged i left and headed to EW, then to GD and Thurgadim. After some exploration i discovered the pit in the Icewell Keep. I made a pet, levitated down there and eventually found blue mobs =). I managed to gate after an avalanche golem double hit me for 186 (pet didn't follow me). I was really glad to have found a dungeon zone with some mos in the low 50s, so i started sending /oocs and tells to get a group or two down there. It was peak time, but in one hour i didn't find a single person willing to come.. There was noone in the pit at all either.. So i gave up, planning to come back some day with my guildmates when everyone has the expansion.<BR> I left Thurgadim and a bit later i found the entrance to Velketor's Labyrinth. Again noone at all inside.. I cleared the first statues and some spiders, started climbing the slippery ramps, discovered that i had to cast see invis to see some of the spiders, eventually reached a place where two statues still green to me punched my pet in the low 100s, so i had to gate. I must say i loved that idea of a dangerous vertical dungeon where you can't cast levitate. But again, impossible to get a group up to hunt there (without my guildmates, at least). Impossible to find a single blue mob that i could take with just one or two people. Impossible to get any loot as the loot is quite probably much further inside.<BR> So now i am going to head back to areas where i can 't get exp either but where i can at least explore and maybe find some items... (I ll try crystal caverns..).<BR> The problem with the high level dungeons in SoV is that the risk factor, though very exciting, requires you to make rather long raids where people won't leave until the end of raid, and where you can't call replacements.. <BR> I guess you noticed that there are always much more people hunting in Karnor than in Howling stones, Chardok or Sebilis (though t he loot in these three other dungeons is much better, the mobs are not much harder, and for sebilis and howling stones the exp is mmuch better too). The reason for this is simple. Karnor is the kind of dungeon where you can zone in, find a group, stay one hour or two, and get a replacement when you have to leave. This could be possible in Sebilis too, but it's further from the druid and wiz ring, and also a key is required.. And this simply can't be done in Chardok unless zone hunting (not very interesting), and can't be done at all in Howling stones. In my opinion, hunting in Karnor is very boring, though. You get to know all the places up to warlord very fast. And it s static camping without much risk, very boring.. but many people prefer that because they can't stay logged for a long time and don't want to waste time organizing a raid, etc..<BR> As far as i know (i haven't explored much maybe..) SoV seems to have no dungeon of that kind at all for the lvl 50+ (not even a sebilis like). So unless being in a very large guild, lvl 50s will very often log on to find themselves unable to make up a raid even with guildmates+extras, or they will log on to see that all their guildmates are already raiding some place and are far inside so you can't join them, or that the only available enchanter joined some other guild's raid hehe =). In such cases, some will log an alter, but that make you lose opportunities to get an invite to some raid; some will go to Karnor, but many people -that don't like karnor, will just go do some other stuff where they can hunt without a balanced group (that means greenie dungeons only..). And about the 'balls', i can tell you that soloing the church in kaesora when you're 51, for instance, requires some skill, involves much risk, and all in all is much more thrilling than camping the skel tower or the warlord with a C2 buffer-mezzer.<BR> I'd appreciate to hear other people's opinion though, especially about the 50+ dungeons of SoV and what they think of them. So far i like them but i doubt i will be often hunting in them.<P>Ektarot, mage 55, Mithaniel Marr.

I just forgot to add one important thing. I remember when iw as one of the 2 lvl 50ies in my guild with most of our guildmates in their thirties, pre-Kuniark. In three months i received 2 invites to PoF, one to Phin, none to PoH (mages were not much sought after when they had not CoH hehe). So I was spending over half of my playing time on alters, but i was also spendind some time having fun in MM or Splitpaw or such. I remember more than one occasion where i saw a lvl 35 bard and a lvl 40 pally wanting to take the cooks or wanting to get the gipsy musicians for the bard bp item. Needless to say they wouldn't have been able to do so (i've seen a full group of lvl40s in trouble when doing cooks, aggroing the negotiator room etc..), and i always offered to help them. I several time grouped with people in their high 30ies low 40ies so that they could get exp while i kill the maid butler and pull them the gargs for granite. I've also on several occasions given away a camp to a group that wanted it and was in the exp level range - not always though, especially if i was aggressed (happened a few times, not often..). And i think that most high lvl people in greenie dungeons are usually ready to help, provided you're cool with them too. About the PnP enforcement.. I could understand in some situations.. For example you bring your group to some named mob, and a high lvl wiz that went killing some other named mob far away comes back and KS you stating it was his camp.. I met a few guys like that.. The simpler is to petition that he Ksed you and to mùake him a bad rep. But otherwise the sharing camp aspect of the PnP policy is not something that anyone should use in usual cases (u find someone camping a mob and u ask to share because of PnP). It's something useful to avoid the problem of the 24h/24h camping of some mob by the same people, IMO. Someone that uses the PnP against the occasional camper, that arrived one or 2 hours before you and that will leave in 2 or 3 hours when he got his item,  would just get a bad rep.

I disagree with you, Muse.  I believe that high levels are currently camping lower level stuff because that's what they have to do to get the new Velious spells.  Once that is done and the spells have been distributed throughout the virtual world (meaning a 34 level spell is selling like a 34 level spell instead of some new novelty toy), then things will adjust to how they are meant to be and higher levels will be quickly bored with greens.  <P>Right now the levels that are designed for 50+ are being explored by the more adventurous and the rest of us are just scratching our heads over how to fill in our spell book and where to go, at least I am.  I camped an area that was 80% green to me, 20% blue last night with some guildies just because they were new mobs and were dropping new spells.  I only got one spell that I needed in 5 hours of fighting, so I'll have to go back to that spot or any other one that we can find that will accomplish the same purpose.<P>It will all eventually shake out.  And the maps that you create will go a long way towards helping with that.  If I had known of a better spot to go to, I might have gone there, but as it was my choices were somewhat limited.<P>Thanks,<P>Farrwalker on E'ci

Muse is completely right. The lvl 50+ are getting no exp and just camping and killing all mobs for loot. This is complete BS and verant should have nerfed them like they did with Naggy. They are not just camping mobs that drop spells that are mostly worthless to them since these spells are lvl 44 or below spells. The only spells i can really see them needing are the porting spells. I have started parties and made the groups split up the mobs just to be an a$$. Anything to disrupt people who are out for loot only and depriving me of fun and EXP. Well that is my 2cp enjoy and thanks again Muse for bringing to light the truth of the matter.

I have to agree with our friend from France here.  I am in a small guild as well, we have 4 over 50, and only a dozen over 40.  I'm level 47, and was camping wurms with a level 38 the other day.  Partly because it's a whole new area, and I didn't want to go running about on my own, and also because I and most of my guild are what can be called "casual players" who only get a couple of hours per day.  Sometimes we get more, especially on weekends.<BR>I look forward to a few things to see and do in Vellious, as I have enjoyed starting in on the Planes.  <BR>One thing I'm looking forward to is going back into Kunark areas and getting more open camps to play in, with all of the uber-guilds off in Vellious now.<P>

 I wanted to add something that i noted when rereading the thread.. Even if there had been no lvl 50ies in tower of frozen shadows when u went there, you wouldn't have found any lvl 35-45 either.<BR> The reason is that new dungeons don't become populated easily by people in that range of level. If you want to explore it, bring a group first. Going there solo is pretty much optimistic.. It's also true for the lvl 50+ dungeons of SoV, though in a lesser way maybe because - at least on my server - the population of 50+ is much more important than the lvl 35-45 population.<BR> When splitpaw was revamped, for instance, for a long time there was rarely anyone in the appropriate range of level deep inside, and during the first weeks even the entrance wasn't much camped. As it was new you had often some level 50 visiting it though. And it's them that updated the maps, discovered the named spawns and what their drop were, etc.. Now you start finding group of lvl 40ies raiding the deepest part of the dungeon. It has been the same for Kaesora, or for the less popular Droga/Nurga. It'll be the same for vellious lvl 35-45 dungeons. None of these dungeons will ever become like SolB/Lguk though, mostly because the lvl 35-45 population is too small to populate additional dungeons.<BR> Don't think i criticize you at all for wanting to hunt there.. I feel pretty annoyed to have zoned in crystal cavern tonight to see 15 lvl 50+ in it (when one lvl 50 can explore it whole in a matter of two hours like i had done the previous night). I appreciate your desire to explore these dungeons, like i wish to explore Thurgadin's pit and Velketor, but you have to find people that also want to, first of all..

Well, I see it like this...<P>1) Everyone wants to see the new stuff... nobody wants to be left out, or to miss some really great loot off some relatively easy creature. (Iskar Berserker Club anyone?)<P>2) Most people are casual players during the week... signing on for only a few hours limits what areas you can hunt in.<P>3) If a high-level person goes to a high-level zone and sees nobody else there, then he's probably not going to hunt there himself... There are a scant few exceptions to this, but it's generally true.  For example, if you went to the Plane of Fear and saw that nobody else was there, would you stay?<P>4) I don't know about others, but as a Cleric I spend about 1/4 of my time helping others at no benefit to myself.  I'm reasonably sure that if you were to actually start wandering around the Tower while all those lvl 50+ people were there, you could easily find someone willing to help you out.  In the end, what's the difference between getting help from a lvl 50+ person and forming a group in order to kill a monster?  Oh yeah, lots more xp for you!<P>5) About 1/3 of the loot I've seen so far from Velious is barely farmable.  The Velium weapons are barely better than Fine Steel and it isn't until you start fighting the lvl 45+ monsters (higher level orcs, giants in their city, named mobs) that you get the kind of stuff that could be farmed for real profit.<P>6) Some of those lvl 50+ people simply don't have lvl 30-40 characters.  They have no other way to explore Velious.  Others have their lvl 30-40 characters busy in other areas, trying to get the loot they know is there rather than risking getting "junk loot".<P>7) Remember, don't try forcing people out.  Try asking for a shot, a turn or even the entire spawn area.<P>8) Understand that there will always be something that everyone wants.  Some of that loot on the wedding party at the top of the Tower is pretty awesome...  Just because you can get xp there doesn't mean that someone else wouldn't just prefer to get the item drops.

Wow there are some good arguments both ways here!   But the way it seems to me, is that some probably most of the high lvls are just exploring and having fun.  Or as a lot of them I know of are exploring and dieing a lot.  I am in a small guild up to maybe 20 members now, with the highest at lvl 51  and several in the 45-50 range.<BR>But as others have said, the ones that even have Velious, have a hard time getting groups. <P>I think, that true, I would love a group of 35 to go into the tower with me and see what we could find :P  and I have that planned for next weekend, when a few more of my lower lvl friends get Velious, but I can understand why a group of higher lvls would also want to explore the dungeon.  <P>Did anyone ever run to Black burrow to explore?  As a troll shaman, I never had a use for BB.  Until I had to pass through to try to get some stuff for my Totemic ( which I never got btw  <IMG SRC="http://www.eqatlas.com/ubb/frown.gif"> ) But, as I went through, I took some time to check it out, see what was there, and veiw new areas. To be honest, I had no idea what lvl of mobs would be there till I started looking.<P>The same is true in Velious.  Many people do/did not know what they would find when they entered a certain zone.  And there is no one around to tell them.  Until, some one gets to the top of the tower, how do we even know that lvl 50's have no business there?<P>Who knows what the deep caves and high spires in Velious have to offer, until a strong enough group can find out, and report back to us....<P><BR>Runteater<BR>Shaman of 35 seasons<BR>

Nice post, Relevancy/Runteater.  You've hit the nail on the head for the most part.  Just because some of us are over level 50, it doesn't mean that we shouldn't get a chance to explore the new areas.  <P>Captain Tripp:  worthless level 44 spells?  My (cleric) "worthless" level 44 spell is the second most efficient heal spell in the game, second only to complete healing.  See <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/spells/spelldescriptions.asp?Id=1444" TARGET=_blank>http://eq.castersrealm.com/spells/spelldescriptions.asp?Id=1444</A>  .  Once I get it, it will be permanently memmed. I haven't been able to get it yet because the mobs known to drop it have always been camped so far.   If we ever find an opening, and a group invokes Play Nice rules to dislodge us, I can assure you that all of their names will be remembered.<P><P>------------------<BR>

So many good points were made here!  Ektarot, your posts were long but soo true!<P>At 45, i'm stuck in Velious.  Have been for 3 days.  I'm at Skyshrine with blues that will knock me dead in no time.  <P>Pathing there stinks by the way.. try to start your fights in the hall AFTER the gate or they will path right out of the zone.. i kid you not.<P>Most of the time there are a few level 50+'s there and this dungeon would be KILLER experience for 45's.  So far though, i've just helped other people get thier keys for the Shrine and tried to get ports out (with no success)<P>The main thing I wanted to post about is this though... <P>PnP is an awful thing. <P> It's none of my busisness what level a person is and what they're doing.. as long as they're not KS'ing, i stay out of their hair.  That means if a level 50 is sitting at a spire outside Paw trying to get FS or anything else for that matter, it's not my right to tell them to leave or share.  It only means it's time to ADVENTURE elsewhere... That's what this game is all about after all.<P>Things are not supposed to be easy.  Struggle builds character.  PNP seems like a way for people who have no Humility to get what they want instead of blazing thier own trail.  <P>Just my 2cp..<BR>  <BR><P>------------------<BR>Trindle Trueheart<BR>Tribunal Server<BR>PROUD Justice Keeper

  I would say that points made on both sides of this have validity, but I think that fair play rules should only be invoked in the worst situations as it is a policy that is too easly abused or used for ones own gain.  EQ is a large (300,000+ last I heard) and diverse culture of players from all walks of life and as such (excepting the good roleplayers to a lesser or greater degree) project their personal styles(the good, the bad and the ugly), wants(loot and level, high adventure), and desires(A fist full of dollars, and a few more, ect..) in the game.  This is human nature, over all I think the EQ community has done a good job of self regulating play.  <BR>  If there be fault to lay, I would lay it at Veriants doorstep.  They have established the level of loot value/trading vs exploring/adventuring.  EQ has the beginings of a rich storyline that is wasted by it's unchanging state, no amount of exploring/adventuring, valiant deeds or villainous acts will ever change it.  BUT, the player(you) can effect the value of loot or trade goods, hence less adventure more loot camps.  Also I beleave Veriant is taking the easy way out of the delimma as their primary responce to any conflict is to nerf the relivant drop or spawn.  <BR>  Anyway thats my soapbox stance.  Good gaming to you all. <IMG SRC="http://www.eqatlas.com/ubb/wink.gif">

PNP isn't about dislodging "higher level" people, or people who can't get XP. That was a "yield rule" proposal that was dropped because it was too controversial. What remains is a right for a SHARE of the spawn. If you don't feel that you can share, you can certainly leave... but PNP ensures that the group with the biggest Guns doesn't crowd everyone else out.

I see the level range of mobs for the Tower now goes up to 56.  How in the world is a group of mid 30s going to kill that?  No wonder higher level characters are in the tower...apparently they belong there.<P>In my only visit to the tower, I was in a group of mostly low 40s and one 54.  We got dogpiled on by a huge crowd of undead on the first level and had to evac or die.  <P>I just don't see what you're complaining about.
