      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      <p>The Steamfont Mountains are a very dangerous place, probably the most 
        dangerous area on Faydwer that you might find yourself travelling on your 
        own. It is a relatively large zone with several distinct areas, and only 
        one newbie type of area some distance from the gnome city, Ak'Anon. Most 
        of the areas of these mountains are filled with creatures deadly to someone 
        of less than 6th level. 
      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>angers </h3>
      <p>Steamfont Mountains are, as I've stated, about as dangerous as Crushbone 
        itself. Most of the creatures are of very high level and are very aggressive, 
        especially in the area around the minotaur caves. The area around the 
        entrance to Lesser Faydark is good for hunting if you are at least 6th 
        level in a group, 8th-10th as a solo. There are skeletons that are aggressive 
        and sometimes carry shields. This is also the only zone on Faydwer to 
        obtain medium sized pelts for patchwork, but the pumas are very dangerous, 
        roughly even with a 7th level warrior or higher. The plague rats that 
        wander this area have a very noxious disease that is difficult to get 
        rid of without spells. The drakes here are also quite dangerous. 
      <p>An even more dangerous area exists by the minotaur caves, which you can 
        reach by following a straight line formed by the windmills away from Ak'Anon. 
        There is a rough dead-end valley that the minotaurs have their caves in, 
        between two old furnaces. The ruins of some giant clockwork device have 
        settled deeply into the ground at the end of this valley over the ages 
        since it last functioned. The monsters that exist here are both very tough 
        and very aggressive, the least aggressive is the obsidian drake and giant 
        clockwork spiders, but anything else that comes within range of you will 
        attack. Most of the monsters are avoidable if you keep your eyes peeled, 
        but the minotaurs themselves are very deadly as they tend to go on patrol 
        through the area and can easily be missed due to the rough floor of the 
        valley and their speed. Adventuring through this area in a group is almost 
        essential from 7th-10th or higher, and I've only seen 15th level and higher 
        people going solo through this area. The minotaurs can be watched if you 
        have a ranger in the group, as they tend to come out of the cave one at 
        a time and stand outside. Once they reach about three outside the cave, 
        they go on patrol. Also, the Minotaur Hero occasionally makes a run towards 
        Ak'Anon, leaving death in his wake. 
      <h3><font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>
      <p>There are many benefits to adventuring in this area. The first, and I'm 
        not sure many people know about this, is that there is a newbie area tucked 
        away on the opposite side of the hill from the minotaur valley, carefully 
        secluded in the back with its own merchants. I wandered through there 
        a couple of times when I knew the servers were busy, and there was nobody 
        hunting there. The belief that all gnomes should stay inside Ak'Anon may 
        not be all true, with such prime, uncontested, hunting here. The other 
        bonus to the zone is that there are many places for selling goods without 
        actually having to go into a different zone to do so. 
      <p>The other obvious benefit, which you'll find out after spending any time 
        in other zones, is that the minotaurs have axes. The minotaur axes are, 
        as far as I know, the second best non-magical 1H-Slashing weapon in the 
        game, and a mainstay of every warrior on this island and the others. They 
        have a Delay of 37 with a damage of 8. Prices for them skyrocket as you 
        get further away, from about 4 platinum in Kelethin up to 10 or higher 
        on the mainland or in Qeynos. Also, no warrior (especially rangers) can 
        really call him or herself complete without one of these in hand. My ranger 
        was handed one of these from some kind soul at 4th level, and he could 
        take on gambles on his own until about 7th, when the axe was more appropriate. 
      <p>In addition to the loot, there is a lot of experience to be gathered 
        here. If I was 10th level, you can bet I'd have a buddy and we'd be hunting 
        this zone from top to bottom. Due to the danger, I've never seen the minotaur 
        valley overcrowded, and there were always so many monsters there that 
        we were in danger of being attacked, not waiting for them to spawn. 
      <h3><font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
        <font size=+2>S</font>teamfont <font size=+2>M</font>ountains</h3>
      <p>The only way into the zone lies through Lesser Faydark, which can be 
        reached through Greater Faydark. From there its Butcherblock Mountains 
        and the boat to the mainland. The path through Lesser Faydark isn't marked 
        well, but by turning left approximately 45 degrees when stepping out of 
        the zone from Greater Faydark, the zone edge to Steamfont is not very 
        far away next to a small gnome outpost town. 
      <p>Ak'Anon also has an entrance into the zone, where the gnomes enter the 
        world. You can't miss it, as all the paths lead to it and there is a massive 
        construction of furnaces and buildings outside to mark the entrance.
