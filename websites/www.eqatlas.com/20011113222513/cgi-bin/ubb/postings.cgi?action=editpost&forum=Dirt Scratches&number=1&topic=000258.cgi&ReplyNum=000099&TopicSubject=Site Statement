<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">To those of you who said they'd send cash through the mail to Muse, you might want to check to make sure you can do that in your area...in the US it is actually illegal to send CASH through the mail.  :/  Checks would be fine, though.  :)

Now, to Muse...

I am almost ready to guarantee you right now that anyone over the level of 20-30 has, at some point, used at least one of your maps.  I've been using them since level 15, myself.  Yes, I have a 3 inch binder full, no, I don't have every single map you've made...at least not yet (I'd hate to bog down your bandwidth).  Yes, I would pay up to 20$ for a CD with all of your maps (just the maps even, the descriptions would be icing on the cake) on them.  Yes, I would most likely pay for a book of your maps and information.  Yes, I think VI is missing a big opportunity here.

There have been people in this forum stating that they would love to help you make your maps, and, while I have no doubt that each and every one of them means what they say, I also have a hard time believing that ANYONE can create the works of art that you do.  I'm almost willing to bet that the people who MADE the zones refer to your maps once in a while...

Anyway, I can sympathize with being in debt and such...I'm currently in grad school studying to become a high-school Physics teacher.  Stop groaning, guys!  Towards the end of the program I'm expected to Student Teach for a period of up to a few months...without pay.  This means I'd have to get a job that didn't require me to be there during the day and that paid enough to make up for the fact that I wouldn't be paid for the REALLY hard work.  I'm sure I'm not in as much debt as you are (but 20K and 200K are equally as impossible for me.  :) ), but I can definitely relate to your struggles.

Now, I'm not sure I could handle a monthly rate sort of thing (unless it were maybe a couple dollars per month...maybe 25$ a year?), but as I said before, I would definitely pay for a CD if you were somehow able to make one (legally or illegally...*cough*) and I could definitely see my way clear to sending a small amount through PayPal or some such.  I'm a Ranger, so I depend on your site (and Allakazam's) to keep me abreast of all things Norrath (nothing more embarassing than a lost Ranger).  

Have I made this post long enough yet?  Egad...I'm probably wasting your bandwidth just typing this.

In short, it looks like you have one helluva fan base, Muse, I'm sure you can work wonders with it.
