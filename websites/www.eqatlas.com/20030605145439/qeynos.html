      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      <p>Qeynos is one of the largest cities in all of Norrath, and one of the 
        two large coastal cities run by the humans. The docks of the city provide 
        trade from Qeynos to the high human city of Erudin, as well as to other 
        areas along the coast. The Guards of Qeynos command posts throughout the 
        surrounding terrain, providing protection to travellers as far away the 
        the Plains of Karana. Most of the major guilds are present in this town, 
        and it is the home of the Clanhouse of the Silent Fist. There is a seamy 
        underbelly to this city, like other port cities, and rumors of corruption 
        and smuggling as well as unsavory street dwellers are a part of everyday 
        life here. There are many (some say too many) drinking establishments 
        within the high walls of the city. 
      <h3><font size=+2>S</font>urrounding <font size=+2>A</font>reas</h3>
      <p>The Gates of Qeynos are a bustle of activity. Many young explorers practice 
        their weapon skills on the sewer creatures that inhabit the area, as well 
        as on the Klikniks, which have an as yet undiscovered hive near the city 
        of Qeynos. More dangerous creatures are fended off by the city guard, 
        and the gnolls from nearby Blackburrow occasionally make assaults on the 
        gates. 
      <p>Further from the gates are the Hills of Qeynos, an area jointly patrolled 
        by Guards of Qeynos and the rangers and druids of Surefall Glade. These 
        hills are more dangerous to the traveller, and wild animals roam freely. 
        Haunted ruins dot the landscape, and the hideous entrance to the dark 
        hole of Blackburrow juts out of the cliff face here. 
      <h3><font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
        <font size=+2>Q</font>eynos</h3>
      <p>Qeynos is a major hub of travel on the western coast of Norrath. It is 
        the only major port which receives regular traffic from Erudin, our human 
        brothers to the west. A great deal of mystical knowledge is gained through 
        this alliance. We are separated from our barbarian brothers in the northlands 
        by the savage gnolls of Blackburrow, but many of them battle their way 
        through to see the lands south of their home. We maintain a strong alliance 
        with the rangers and druids of Surefall Glade, though they prefer to stay 
        clear of our streets and buildings. 
      <p>To the east, however, lies vast uncharted territory. The human city of 
        Freeport might as well lie on the sun as on our very continent, for no 
        traveller has managed to create an ocean route to that port, and overland 
        travel either takes the traveller through the savage swamps of the ogres 
        and trolls or through the Plains of Karana and lands further to the east, 
        which are populated by bandits and giants, as well as other creatures 
        that defy description. Our City Guard maintains posts in the Plains of 
        Karana, but they are scattered and only extend into the western edge of 
        this vast area. 
      <h3><font size=+2>L</font>ocal <font size=+2>C</font>olor</h3>
      <p><b>Places</b> 
      <p>There are four main pubs in town, Lion's Mane Tavern, Mermaid's Lure, 
        Fish's Ale, and Crow's Pub and Casino. This list is roughly in order of 
        decreasing politeness of the inhabitants. The Lion's Mane is an average 
        quality pub, serving drinks in an amiable atmosphere, relatively close 
        to the docks. Mermaid's Lure is directly on the docks, sports an aquatic 
        decor (including odor) and the crowd that goes along with it. Fish's Ale 
        is near the docks, and draws a clientele similar to Crow's, but is better 
        kept. Crow's, despite being next to the sanctity of the Silent Fist Clan 
        and their reflecting pool, sports the most unsavory of crowds. None of 
        them would even speak to me other than to call me scum the last time I 
        was there. The only redeeming point about the place is that you can brew 
        your own alcohol in the back, but I personally wouldn't, who knows if 
        they clean that thing. 
      <p>The Wind Spirit's Song is my personal place, being the home to the League 
        of Antonican Bards, the songs and poems that drift out the door entice 
        me to return home whenever I find myself singing to an unenlightened crowd. 
      <p>The Grounds of Fate provide entertainment of the bloody sort, where warriors 
        vie against monsters captured by the guards to the cries of fans. Truly 
        gruesome. 
      <p><b>People</b> 
      <p>There are many odd people in town, some of which you should hold onto 
        your purse more tightly around. In fact, it's wisest to hold onto your 
        purse until proven otherwise. One such individual who I speak with often 
        is Merkes Tabolet, who can be found roaming the docks trading in his speciality 
        (which happens to be everything). His goods are very handy, and he's an 
        interesting soul, but I don't open my purse in front of him, if you get 
        my meaning... 
      <p>Also, Qeynos is the home to a number of rude individuals, people who 
        everyone seems to either dislike or ignore. They take this personally 
        however, and will attack those around them, and the guards don't get involved 
        in such fights, so they are best avoided by weaker adventurers.
