<body>
Early this morning, on April 7th, we experienced a server failure.  We're currently working to bring everything back up, but for now only the <a href="http://wow.allakhazam.com">WoW site is available</a>.  The <a href="http://wow.allakhazam.com/forum.html">forums are also accessible</a> through it.
