Not knowing what it was I ventured in and low and behold I had found Befallen.  Now being a mighty dwarf Paladin of 9 seasons I figured this to be alittle over my head since was so far from a city.  How wrong I was.  The skeletons proved to be blues and whites with some decaying thrown in.  This was the most fun I've had in many a week of adventuring.  I was even able to defeat the Skeleton Llord with some help from a friendly cleric named, Care.  Once I was able to defeat the lord I considred myself strong enough to defeat the Shadowknight who held the key to the lower reaches of the area.  Got the key and just now am getting prepared to venture deeper.  The undead fear spell the Paladins get at level 9 saved my butt many a times when I was starting to get over whelmed by the constant onslaught of Skeletons(not to mention the trains being brought up from the lower levels).<P>My point is, just because there is no city close by doesn't mean it is a HIGH level dungeon. Take a peek inside. You'll know after the first few mobs you encounter if it is to tough for your level.<P>Kitelar, Paldin on Povar.<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Epicurus Quickli</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Just watch the lower levels..they grow bigger and more difficult very quickly.

When they're finished beating on the pet they transfer the aggro to you. If you don't keep a tight rein on your pet and stop it chasing off you'll end up training yourself...not a pleasent experience  <IMG SRC="http://www.eqatlas.com/ubb/frown.gif"></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Frenick</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">The skeleton is called Llrod and is part of the SK 'reaper of the dead' quest ...

It may seem good but if you cast it the mob can run all around the whole dungeon, picking up a few of his buddies from lvl 3 of the dungeon, before returning up to kill you and the rest of the lower lvl people up there. trust me, it happened to me and everyone was REALLY mad about it. Well just thought Id let you know, and By the way, whats up with the dugeon now? i havent been there in some time, is it still low lvl or what? what is the lvl range there now, and is it even Undead still?

Me, being foolish, thought I could breeze threw this zone and maybe pick up a little loot. There are swarms of greenies that agro like mad.

I got locked in a room after I chased down a green who ran into a hallway(the door had been opened by someone) I chased him in and the door closed behind me, no one in the zone was able to get the key so I was sittin there waitin for the door to open. What do you know, all the greens that had been killed repopped. I can take on greens no problem, unless those greens have lots of DoT's, fears, and high DD's. This wasn't just one or two little casters this was like 10-15 casters. Damn You Lany's T'vyl!! Its her that caused these changes, no longer is it a happy little undead, even though I wasn't there prior to these things I have heard of people around the level I was at being ok.
