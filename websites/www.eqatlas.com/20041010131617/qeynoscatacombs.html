      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      <p>The Qeynos Catacombs is the vast ancient water supply to the city of 
        Qeynos. The area was long ago walled off when it was no longer used, but 
        then became the haven of the seedier elements of area, including the beggars 
        and thieves, smugglers and thugs, and up to the members who worship the 
        Plague Bringer himself. 
      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>angers </h3>
      <p>The Qeynos Catacombs can be considered to be an early exercise in factions 
        and how they play a role in the safety of an area. Many of the creatures 
        here (in fact, most) start out ambivalent to most people, and this includes 
        everything but the undead and the people in the Temple of Bertoxxulous, 
        who will both kill anyone that doesn't pass as &quot;evil&quot; very quickly. 
        Then, depending on who and what you decide to pick battles with, various 
        members of the surroundings, be they the guards of Qeynos or the rougher 
        elements, will become aggressive to you. Be aware that killing guards 
        down here, where they are very weak, can lead to you being attacked by 
        the vastly stronger guards in the city above. 
      <p>Otherwise, the only wandering monsters that are aggressive to all are 
        the large piranha, which can hit fast and for quite a bit of damage to 
        a relatively new adventurer. Take a look in the water before making a 
        long swim through a corridor with no exits, especially if you are not 
        a good swimmer, or you could be trying to get your corpse out of the bottom 
        of the water down here, while avoiding the same piranha.
      <p>Recently, the catacombs have become much more dangerous, and several 
        powerful undead spectres can be seen in various areas, as well as wandering 
        septic rats that are very powerful and aggressive. It is therefore wise 
        to be much more careful when travelling around the catacombs than in days 
        past.
      <h3><font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>
      <p>This area is a pretty good area for low level adventurers to hunt in 
        and fight in, with lots of readily available creatures that, for the most 
        part, don't group up when you fight them. There is also a good progression 
        up through the levels, and you could fight here from level one through 
        to level ten or so without leaving for anything other than supplies. This 
        is especially true if you are an evil character, for there is a bank located 
        in the Temple of Bertoxxulous as well as merchants that sell all manner 
        of goods.
      <p>The additional benefit, in my book, is that this zone is always very 
        uncrowded. There are never more than ten people in the whole zone, and 
        often many many less. This means that you will likely never have to deal 
        with kill-stealing and the other annoying things that happen in the more 
        crowded newbie areas up where the sun is. It is also nice down here if 
        you are evil, because it gives you the feeling of being truly evil, wandering 
        through the sewers beneath the city above.
      <h3><font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
        <font size=+2>Q</font>eynos <font size=+2>C</font>atacombs</h3>
      <p>There are multiple separate ways into the Qeynos Catacombs, all are through 
        tunnels that lead into them, and most of these are underwater ones. It 
        is also possible to pass completely through Qeynos from the outside to 
        where the ship lands by travelling through the Catacombs. The first entrance 
        is located outside the city gates through a secret opening in the walls. 
        Look for the heavy ivy clinging to the wall and the moisture that comes 
        up from the well inside. This is the only entrance from outside the city. 
        Next you are able to enter through the pool outside of the Monk's Guild 
        Hall, by swimming down through a shaft inside. There is also an entrance 
        from underneath Crow's Tavern in the Thieves Guild Hall, but this is unsafe 
        as secret pits will drop you into the shark pit. 
      <p>There are two entrances near the bank area, one is located behind the 
        bank in the water before the magic-users guild halls. The other is in 
        front of the bank in the water as well. The other underwater entrance 
        lies in the harbor, in the next small area near to the dock where the 
        boat arrives at. The final entrance is the secret entrance that the members 
        of the Temple of Bertoxxulous use to get around, and that is through a 
        secret tunnel lying under the Grounds of Fate.
