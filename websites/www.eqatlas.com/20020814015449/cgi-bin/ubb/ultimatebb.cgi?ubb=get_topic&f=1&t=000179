 I've been playing for over a year now. Love the game great fun. "Yay" But Its Disneyland. The Twink crybaby's who just started playing. The "He's to high to be in this zone" Whinners. With the Warrens out there is added talk about spell twinking not getting xp. I have a cleric does that mean I can't help my friends?<P> Why not make a Server. Speacial PVP typ server. City's would be None PVP. (Trade reasons) And a easy "twink" format so we can give stuff we worked hard to get to are NEW character.  <IMG SRC="http://www.eqatlas.com/ubb/biggrin.gif"><P> I want to send the request to Michelle Butler but before I do so. I feel it should be talked about buy other players. And get some ideas. So please post helpfull ideas not "Thay will never do that" Ones. Thay might or thay might not. Who can say but the big "V". I want to send to them a well thought out idea with a lot of input.<P> thank you for youe time on this<P>Wolff

yes yes yes.... I want an all adult server. I do not invite children to play our table top games with us because the content is not suitable for them. I feel the same about EQ. As adults we should have the option and freedom of choosing a server that is restricted to only adults.. 18 and over only please, besides that I don't really care what the other details are.<BR>Dammi

Unfortunately, age has relatively little to do with maturity....<P>Some of the most mature people I know in game are *gasp* around 15.<P>Some of the biggest train-causing, begging, cursing, obnoxious fools are... well, in their 30s.<P>I think a "mature" server would end up being worse than any other, people would think it would be easy pickings.

I'll have to agree with Danalog on this issue. As annoying as pubescent kids can be with their shouting and clamour, adult people can top this behaviour by a notch. Kids usually apologize for killstealing, adults do it on purpose. It's especially ridiculous to have two grown men argue about how either of them is less of an idiot by right of age. 'I'm already 28, so you're the ****head!' Oh boy... No, this has less to do with age than with maturity.

Yes I agree there are people who never "Mature" to a level that lets them handle basic problems like KS or generel be rude.  <BR> What I would hope to see is a server. set up with fewer rules. The play nice rule. "Gone" Let the baby's cry all thay want. It's not just a "Adult" Sever but rather one for us "None cry babys" <P> Danalog, Your statment is true. But I don't think you got what I am after. Not a "Adult only server" But a "None disneyland play nice" server. It will let people KS, It will let people pull trains. It is a harsh battle weary land of violance. And I was looking at a server to do that. I played before the play nice rules. I liked it. "no I did not pull trains and if I had one I still yelled out   <IMG SRC="http://www.eqatlas.com/ubb/smile.gif"> " <BR> WindsofAutumn, agian Great points. But I am not looking to provide a setting that would let to much whinning. All the things we need to turn of a player are already in game. <P> All I want is a server without the disneyland rules in it. So we will still get whinners but I can at least hack them down to size and send them back a level or two. LOL  J/K  <IMG SRC="http://www.eqatlas.com/ubb/wink.gif">  <P>

I agree completely-basically what you're asking for is UO, eq style.  towns are safe zones, pvp everywhere else, and you can whine all you want but the GM's respnses will be "I'm sorry, but I cannot help you with that"  <IMG SRC="http://www.eqatlas.com/ubb/wink.gif">  It'd be really nice, but as has been said above, age has nothing to do with maturity, and people will still complain and whine, if not to GM's then to you.

I think you are on to a great idea wolff. I honestly hope that such a server is consructed if only to have those few individuals who are notorious for KSing and training move there. You see my personal love of the game comes from grouping and meeting new people not slaughtering newbies that get on my nerves. The kind of server you want seems to be one where the higher lvl characters (played by people who can spend days at a time on EQ) rule as gods over the casual gamer. Though it would create a more REALISTIC enviroment i doubt you would find many people starting new characters on a server where the strong survive and the weak are nothing more than lambs being led to their slaughter. One point to put into perspective is that EQ had its huge jump in popularity after these rules were changed and i think that says something about what alot of people thought about qoute the old way unqoute. Yes though bring out this new server so that perhaps at least a few less headaches will be created for those of us who are truly here to have fun instead of just stomping on the little guys who cant or dont want to log the hours you do on EQ.

PushyBob! You got it! The uber players would love this. And like you do play to meet people to. But there are times it would be nice to play without aLL THE DISNEY'ISH rules<BR> Oh and as far as the huge leap of memebership into EQ at about the same time newspapaers where starting to do more stories on MOG's. And EQ was a prime subject at at the time. Like crime is down now in but jobs are up. Not becuse there are more cops on the street or ) Tolarance. But becuse more people can work. <BR> And it is true I do want "A REALISTIC" playing inviroment. For me as a old gamer (37) It would be nice.<BR> I would add that I think it should be a team'ish set up.

 One more Idea maybe Bards could be None PVP. We could have spells that can hide your PVP stats. There are a lot of ways we can do this. And I am not trying to make everyone happy with this eather for that matter. Just a few of us. If there are 1500 Players on the Strait PVP player all the time then I bet we can get at least 1000 some odd players on this one. And no rule says you have to kill anyone for anyreason.   <IMG SRC="http://www.eqatlas.com/ubb/wink.gif">

A more mature server would be great.  However, keep in mind that you may eliminate new people rather than the annoying people.  For example, I have only been playing for a month and a half, and have only recently found out what a train is.  No one really explains all this stuff to us when we begin.  For example, some higher level players kill things and leave the corpses for the lower level ppl to loot so that they can get some money.  On the same token, others just leave the bodies strewn across the acreage intending to pick it up later.  How is a newbie supposed to know which it is?  Especially one trying to role-play, and not willing to "shout" every two seconds?  Also, its hard to figure out how to make socials and run while typing etc, so I think we need to find out why someone is doing something before we chalk them up to being a bad gamer.  Sometimes they just don`t know better.  I would like to see some people more dedicated to role-playing.  Myself and another druid zoned into someones train of kobald`s the other week and his friend (complete strangers btw) gave us heck for not healing him....there were many things wrong with that.  First of all, when being attacted yourself, spells get interrupted, secondly, its extremely hard to mouse click on a dwarf in a sea of kobalds.  Thirdly, it eliminated the idea that we may have roleplaying issues with healing strangers....Ie/ what if I decide to follow the idea that dark elves are evil?  Should i be expected to heal them still?  I don`t think so...  I had to wonder why this person assumed all of this.  That is the type of person I would like to avoid in the future.<BR>&lt;Them and the ones who occasionally try to get me to go behind a tree with them&gt;  I would like a server to eliminate these types.<BR>Cressida (Keepers of the Fiery Myste) lvl 14 druid.

Trwolff, nice idea. I would love to see a server like that.<BR>Unfortunately, making a server like that would require Verant to change each individual zone's PvP settings, since some zones are half cities/ half outdoors. Personally, I think Verant would be too lazy to do something like that. I could be wrong though....

I've only been playing EverQuest for a short time, but I have been playing online games for sometime. Immature people tend to be under 18, yet I know many immature adults.<P>Over 18 doesn't equate to maturity, and you would still have immature crybabies on an Over 18 server.

     The server is in testing, it's team diety PvP, and I intend to have a character there when it goes live; however...  Calling people to the mat for being rude, self-absorbed, or just plain mean is not "immature".  I think the existence of servers where there are rules (just like laws in real life) that protect people from being abused and abased by those who chose to behave as if they are more important than anyone else is a good thing.  It's not immature, it's called civilized society.  <P>When a group of people gang rapes and then kills my friends wife, I'm not going to call him an "immature whiner" for wanting the state to take action on his and the rest of societies behalf by removing the creeps from the rest of the population.  However, in a gaming arena such as EQ, where different servers can employ different rules, I like the idea of a server that allows the "law of the jungle" to prevail.  It gives me a new experience for my money, and I hope it will remove some of the jack-asses I see scamming newbies in front of Freeport from the servers that are meant to have a less harsh experience (player interaction wise); and move them to a server where when I see something like this, I not only have the option of rigging out the newbie in new gear to replace the shield he just lost, but to kill the scammer, and then call in twenty or so friends (in anticipation of the coming posse following his CR) to make sure the guy isn't going to be collecting his body in the near future.  The end of play nice rules on one server is a great idea, one that when coupled with one character per account, creates some interesting options.<P>For as many Ayn Rand wanna bes who cause grief and think that their narcissistic personality type betters the world; there are just as many that know how to play as well and level as fast, and who see the above player-types as social leaches rather than misunderstood adults who don't need the "Disneyland rules" of The Man hampering them.<P>If this server is a success, it will be because it draws in both of these types and allows them to settle disputes Wild West style rather than by /report.  I don't see this as an "adult server" at all, but a fun one where the gloves can come off in a virtual world where no one really gets hurt.<P>As for your the first posters views on twinking or what-not, why do complaints of people about you manipulating the game bother you so much?  Some people twink and power level (myself included) and some people don't (I'm also in this group).  The character I've played over the last couple of months has fought hard for every small victory and every item he has.  It's made the game interesting again for me, and given me some perspective on twinks I didn't have before.  Manipulating the game does what exactly?  It doesn't make me very connected or invested in a character or the story line.  The twinked character just becomes another in a list of vanilla signatures we see at the end of messages on boards like this: e.g. 56 Pally, 47 Druid, 51 SK, etc...  It is just creating "wealth" in a place where it means nothing in the real world (ebay aside).  <P>Verant from day one has made an effort (many times misplaced or ignorantly) to put the story and the primary character above the desires of the power gamer.  We all knew this when we signed up.  Why now is there whining about Verant trying to follow through with what they told you they were shooting for in the first place?  Why are there complaints when those who signed up thinking the was a good idea decide your SK is violating the spirit of the game by carrying a weapon with a DD proc at level 1?  <P>The whiner is you.  The game rules may be changed to disallow someone to level without suffering.  So what?  I may not be able to give a level 1 character uber gear and then have a friend come over and sit on my network and have him power level the guy with a level 53 druid to 25 in a day.  Big deal.  If I wanted a company that didn't care about story lines, twinking, and manipulating the game, I would just go buy anything made by Blizzard.  I don't think that is a childish attitude, I think that paying money to someone for a game and then complaining endlessly that they won't let me do anything I want, whenever I want to do it regardless of how it affects others is. <P>Plessy Untwinked 30 SK<BR>Vanilla everything else

I certainly hate it when your dealing with a rude person who demands to have your camp with you instead of asking.Then they go AFK and the camp pops,theyre gone and you hate them already so you KS(ever had a bad day???)and then a guide comes up and says":you have been banned for 1 week for ks'ing." Can you tell this has hapend to me?I managed to weasle my way out of the suspension though.<BR>They gotta realize that people hold grudges and that we gotta vent our anger(some just do it more than others). They get known and people don't group with them...Case closed, and the guide didnt have to mess with you in RL.

Plessy Tapenslap! Great post. I for one injoyed reading your post. And for the first time got a better perspective I did not look at before. I really injoyed it.<P> I ass-u-me you ment me when you where talking about the first poster. Yes in some ways it does bother me. But all my characters are part of a family group. I roleplay heave and for story line have killed off. (deleated) Characters. But when I make or a friend make a desendant of one of my first characters I love the statment. This is my fathers sword. I guess being a old AD&D player. I just find it more fun for long story lines. And I have never once asked the GM/Guide to "Save me get my corpse" I loose it its gone. End of story. Thats life.  And as far as you "We have laws in this world" I liked how it started. Insitful. But I think you forget that it is a city regonal system. In the middle of the desert there are NO laws. No cops, and no lawyers. If I am in freeport and attack someone eather on the PVP server or a duel. The gurds will attack me. Thats the LAW.<P> "Whinning" I think we will agree on this. I to feal most people post to whine. I woundered that to when I posted this. But I felt. That a idea not shared is a waist for all. even if it is NOT a good idea. Every one as a rule thinks diffrently. I knew if I use the words "Adult server" The first thing people in general think is sex. And again thats not what I ment. Olso every one thought I have ment Age as for a adult server. I did not. I know 12 year olds whith more mature then a 50 year old.<P> I onjoy Disneyland. I like the fact there are no spitting rules and no weapons. I only used it as a ref. For all the rules.<P> I do injoy this game. Please do not get me wrong on this. If thay do not change a thing I will still play. I do feal that as a free thinking people there is always room for change. Somtimes it is good. Somtimes it is bad. Some of the worst/best or best/worst ideas have come from just giving them out.<P> All in all, If you read my hole post I think you will find in one way or a nother why I decided to post in the firstplace. A idea is as good as people think it is. <P> So to finish this long post. I want to thank EVERY ONE! for posting. <P> And to you Plessy Tapenslap. I thank you for the best insight to a none twinker I have ever read. Mostly what I have ever heard are insaults, randum curse words, and the "I did not help a stupid twink who was being killed buy a &lt;target&gt;" Statments and did not know why it mattered so much if I was or was not twinked.<P> Plessy Tapenslap one more thing. I never said it was childe'sh not to twink. And I did not say you have to twink. I said I wanted a story line. I said I wanted family bank accounts so you can give stuff to family members or guild accounts. If I did not understand you correctly PLEASE post again and reexplain it to me. You are by far one of the best poster I have seen. I will be looking for your post now.<P> Thanks<BR>Wolff

     After reading my post, I believe that I too needed sleep before writing it.  It was possibly a bit harsh, and I apologize.  When I saw the adult server topic, my first thought wasn't sex, but some sort of age verifying system that is probably unfeasible, and as was pointed out, wouldn't exclude adults who behave like children anyway.  What I saw of your idea in fact, was the fourteen year old power gamers dream of God-like status within a virtual world where he could behave like a tyrant, with little to no consequences.  I still think this may end up being the case, but love playing on the server nonetheless.  The one character per account rule means that people will live and die by their reputations, and if someone pushes the bounds too far, it will give being kos a very harsh new reality that will be harder to duck then the other pvp servers due to the 1 character restriction.<P>     On to the twinking and what not.  I really don't have a big problem with twinking to be honest.  I just twinked a friend who bought the game yesterday.  While I did twink him, I did not give him items for which there are no upgrades.  Full plate, Bark Shield, Sparoli Defender/Messenger of the Queen etc.  People twink for different reasons, and in this case, since the guy isn't into MMORPGs, killing rats with a rusty long sword just isn't going to be his idea of fun.  I gave him gear that will allow him to not have to think about money or upgrading until he is level 30 or better, so he can just focus on the game.  He bought the game to have another way to spend time with me, and I hope that over time he grows to enjoy the Everquest in it's own right.  <P>     I will not power level him however.  My reasons are simple.  First off, it would do my friend a disservice.  He would not learn about what his character can do in different situations, and he would be ill prepared to group after I power leveled him to 30.  I have run into enough bards that don't twist, and Wizards who don't assist, to unleash another one on my server.  Twinking alone does not make a character a minor deity due to the skill system and damage caps, it only helps a bit.  Power leveling however is a different deal.  When someone who is twinked joins an equal level group, they pass on the benefit of the high level equipment to other people in the zone.  Since twinks are less likely to need loot, and often bow out of the loot order, they help the group even more, and are the least likely to ninja loot.  <P>     When they walk into the zone with a high level healer, they take potential kills away from that same group.  While doing this, they also "rub it in the face" of the people standing next to them at a camp (the Unrest wall comes to mind) who either are choosing to play legit, or do not have a level 58 cleric to level them.  Watching someone who cons blue to you take out five yellows (one or two of which you would have liked to pull to your group) at the same time is a slap in the face to say the least.  It is not fair to those sharing spawns near by or passing though wanting to camp the spot as it was designed to be fought in.  It just takes advantage of a game design flaw to benefit one person who is exploiting it, at the expense many times of those who are not.<P>     One other thing I want to bring up about twinking, is that I never twink a character with quest armor.  I do this out of respect for those who have quested for every piece they have gotten.  I know how much it must suck for a Bard who has just gotten his fourth piece of Lambent to walk proudly into his guild after many corpse runs, risks taken, and an empty bank account to get it, just to find someone on the other side of the door who cons green and has it all on.  It's disrespectful, and undermines the achievement of the Bard who quested for his/her armor.  Besides the armor being so noticeable, I choose Bards because I find that to be the class that twinks do the worst.  Nothing amazes me more than a level 25 Bard in full Lambent who doesn't know how to assist or twist; and don't even get me started on the lame ass song selection.<P>     The point of this whole rant is that on the twink and power leveling issue, please look at it from the perspective of someone who's primary character is the level of your twink.  It's the equivalent of being in the working world for ten years, and finally getting to buy the new mid price car you want, and then being cut off on the way home from the car dealer by a teenager in a Lexis.  The natural reaction is a bit of resentment, especially when the ideal our society (and this is true in Everquest as well) is that you work for what you get in life, and have an appreciation for what you have managed to achieve through that hard work.  I bone chip leveled my friend to 6 so he wouldn't lose several thousand pp worth of gear, and let him set out to explore yesterday.  Within minutes, I got a phone call from him asking how he should react to people calling him names who were high level and saw him in the gear.  I explained to him that they had good reasons to dislike what I had done for him, as well as I had good reasons to do it.  My advice to him was to ignore it, or if they engaged him in conversation, to respectfully tell them that he was new to the land of Norrath, but was lucky enough to have a patron who was willing to help ease his way into the world, but had now left him with this nice gear to explore for himself.  He used this tact, and actually made a friend this way who showed him how to set up a couple of hot keys that I had not gotten to yet, and helped him find his first group.  I will be playing a level 12 Shaman (who has long been on the shelf) with him soon who is using a kite shield and a FS spear with leather armor.  We will make an odd couple.<P>     That's my expanded, nicer version about how I feel in regards to power leveling and twinks.  I think it's what people would tell you in a broader forum like message boards if they thought it through.  Most people don't type very fast, and don't like to write, so it's easier to say "you suck", then "I disagree with you, and here's why".  I think that having level restrictions on procs and damage caps takes care of the twinking issue aside from my observations on quest armor, although I would be ok with level restrictions on some of the higher end armor with high stat bonuses.  I do think the various methods of power leveling are a huge exploit that I would like to see disappear.  While I don't necessarily want people to suffer, I don't think I'm the only person who wants people to earn a last name and the ability to disarm an opponent.  Having a high level character may enable one to share the wealth, and I think many people are ok with that, but it shouldn't take all of the effort out of having another.  The "whining" that bugs me in the gaem is not the "you trained me/ks me/you are a twink a-hole" kind, because I don't see that as being a baby.  Who I see as whiners are people following me around seeing that I have a Wurmslayer and an MM shield, and therefore, they are entitled to 10pp from me.  EQ is not like real life where the guy begging you for a quarter may be bi-polar, and was sexually abused all through his childhood, never having a shot at anything more than a subsidized apartment and cheap booze; if you could manage to log on to the game, you can manage to make your own damn 10pp, but that's just my 2cp.<P>Plessy<BR>Soon to be lvl 12 Shaman        <p>[This message has been edited by Plessy Tapenslap (edited 07-12-2001).]

Lol I agree a no bi*ching server would be nice without rules where you see someone you don't like or is against your diety you could cut off there head for I have played on the Quelious server for about 6months without a petiton on me. only one message from a gm was sent to me becouse the whole zone was getting spamed by a real anoying cleric who kept complaining about being trained on but liveing so I finally said I trained him just to quit the spam fight to have him say he wants to dual right away so I graciously agreed and went to meet him and make his final day's the most pain full I could only to initiate the dual to find him hideing behind another dual so we fought in tells tell i got him to drop his old dual to fight me (I was about 15 lvls over him and yet he knew i dident train him becouse I was fighting in OT and was on my way to FV for archery supplies) I ended his life quick only to have him come back and continue his wineing tell a GM was petitoned against his spaming. the GM gave me a tell saying you dont need to fight him again he will deal with it. The only rule I would like on a new server is the spaming rule!!
