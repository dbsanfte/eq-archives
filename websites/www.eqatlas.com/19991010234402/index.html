            into the canoe. Pan your camera down to point at the bottom of the 
            canoe, and right click on the bottom. You will get a message that 
            says &quot;You have the helm&quot; or something like that. Pan up 
            using PageUp and use your regular keys to move around.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="-1">A word of advice while in the canoe, 
            never ever hit your right mouse button. This is very important if 
            you are using auto-move, because you will run right off the end of 
            your canoe, which in something like the Ocean of Tears is bad. Although 
            I've been able to get back into the canoe (believe me, it took more 
            hand-eye coordination and timing than I can usually muster), it is 
            not easy, and you will likely wind up swimming...</font></p>

                <p>Well, I don't know what's going on with me, I think I just 
                  have bad luck. Last week I went away and didn't get much done, 
                  this week I got sick and again didn't get much done (except

                <p>I want to take this opportunity to thank Nuadhu Tuathua on

                  the best person to have around in a pinch, and he has helped 
                  me many times in my mapping of the higher level areas, going 
                  to a further extent than is required by any. Thanks Nuadhu!</p>

            <td> 
              <blockquote> 
                <p>First off, I'd like to apologize to everyone who has emailed 
                  me this past week that I haven't responded to. This week was 
                  super busy at work and I just didn't have time to write back, 
                  and this weekend I had to choose between mapping and emailing, 
                  and I chose mapping. I will respond (and thanks to all who offered 
                  to help, you'll be hearing from me soon) probably on Tuesday 
                  or Wednesday.</p>
                <p>Second, I have a lot of corrections to my existing maps that 
                  I will be putting up in a few days. I have Post-Its everywhere 
                  telling me what I have to change, so trust me, it's coming...</p>
                <p>Thirdly, I'd like to announce the first (as far as I know) 
                  complete map of <b><a href="blackburrow.html">Blackburrow</a></b> 
                  anywhere on the internet. Hope you like it. I've also put up 
                  as much as I could map of <a href="runnyeye.html"><b>Runnyeye 
                  Citadel</b></a>, which should help the lower levels. Note that 
                  both of these were mapped as a solo 15th level Ranger, and that's 
                  as far as I could get in Runnyeye, so you were warned... I planned 
                  on putting up Splitpaw map today, but I'm catching a cold and 
                  have a splitting headache right now...</p>
                <p>Fourth, I plan on adding more to this site. In addition to 
                  the previously mentioned Monster Guide that will hopefully be 
                  coming up soon, I also plan on adding a &quot;Tactics&quot; 
                  section to the map guides. These will probably involve more 
                  the dungeons, and the plan is to have a totally different dungeon 
                  format, describing specific areas with their dangers and benefits, 
                  rather than overall benefits and dangers. This is because dungeons 
                  are totally different in different parts of them. If you have 
                  any tactics you want to see included, send them in!</p>
                <p>Lastly, just a followup to my video board problems... I managed 
                  to buy a Creative Labs Ultra TNT2 a couple of weekends ago and 
                  it's been working great for me. The only time it goes slow is 
                  when I'm loading all of Kelethin, or this past weekend when 
                  I was hunting in Permafrost and had about 10 spellcasters on 
                  the screen at once. Why did I buy that instead of the others? 
                  Diamond is no longer owned by Diamond (and it cost about $40 
                  more, for what I don't know), I didn't feel like waiting for 
                  the GeForces (actually, couldn't wait), and didn't feel like 
                  buying another regular TNT. Don't even ask me about Voodoo...</p>

                  was rushed, as I had to come back and work last night. I got 
                  about 4 hours of sleep for two nights in a row, and no sleep 
                  whatsoever last night, so I'm going to bed early on purpose 
                  for the first time in years. I think I've found my limit of

                <p>So I'm going to be in NYC for the weekend for the wedding of 
                  a good friend. I went to get my portable computer fixed (the 
                  trackpad button had broken) and the people fixed it, but somehow 
                  confused &quot;button&quot; with the pad part of it, so they 
                  replaced my perfectly functioning pad. This means no updates 
                  when I get back from my trip, which kind of stinks. Although 
                  there's a good chance I'll be packing my map-making stuff with 
                  me out there, so there may be maps when I get back. No EQ for 
                  3 days! I should be able to take it.</p>
                <p>So keep sending in info about critters (although I wish I had 
                  someone I could point you to who could receive it &lt;nudge 
                  nudge wink wink&gt;). Also, send in any maps of dungeons you

                  web site. First and foremost, I am willing to post up maps and 
                  guides to the dungeons, which I won't be able to map for some 
                  time. I plan on putting up maps of Unrest, Blackburrow, Splitpaw, 
                  and Upper Guk sometime within the next two weeks, but all the 
                  other dungeons are fair game. Please send in your maps!</p>
                <p>Also I'm looking for someone to collect data on monsters and 
                  creatures in the various zones. I would like to post up a monster 
                  guide, and need some help doing it. I need the monster's name, 
                  level and special abilities, as well as what loot they carry 
                  and what faction hits you get when you attack them. If you're 
                  interested in helping out, let me know. Of note, you don't need 
                  to know any HTML or formatting or layout or anything. It's just 
                  for information gathering and sending to me, and I can put it

                <p>My god, why didn't someone tell me I didn't have a Splitpaw 
                  guide up! I've been assuming one had already been made, and 
                  people were just space cadets. I should have listened to my 
                  first grade teacher, who told me that if I think someone else 
                  is being a space cadet, it's much more likely that I am. At 
                  any rate, I've posted up a guide for <b><a href="splitpaw.html">Splitpaw</a> 
                  </b>as well as a guide and zone map for <b><a href="dagnor.html">Dagnor's

                  section with the correct addresses for these poor sites.</p>
                <p>I was also hoping on having bigger news today, but the source 
                  of my bigger news is not coming through for me (could I be more 
                  vague?).</p>
                <p>Spent more time in Unrest, pulling from the house. There's 
                  a nerve-racking job. My favorite panicked typing line was &quot;i'm 
                  brooted&quot;. For those of you who don't speak fear, that's 
                  actually &quot;i'm rooted&quot; with a little silent &quot;b&quot; 
                  at the front. I don't know how I hit the b key in the middle 
                  of all that (look at your keyboard, it's not near anything). 
                  I also like &quot;accidentally&quot; hitting the &quot;ghoul 
                  out the side door&quot; hotkey I have just to see my party jump 
                  up and look (just kidding guys!). At any rate, I'm having a 
                  blast in Unrest, expect to see the guide for that up near the 
                  time I have the Blackburrow and Splitpaw maps up (as well as 
                  Upper Guk). Yes, they're coming!</p>
