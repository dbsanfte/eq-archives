<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by Muse:
[B]Here's a bit of information on Luclin that might come in handy for people new to the area.  I'm not sure how much of this is in the actual game, but just in case.

History

Luclin is a moon that floats around Norrath.  The moon was chosen long ago by the goddess Luclin, where she created life.  Following that, several groups from Norrath itself also moved onto the planet.

First were the Shissar, the ancient rulers of Kunark and enslavers of the iksar.  When their arrogance angered their gods, they were nearly wiped out by the Greenmist sent to kill them.  They used their magics to come to Luclin, forming the Grey around them as a defense against the Greenmist, should it ever find them.

Next was the Combine empire.  On Norrath, they had built a huge empire, but after time it started to have internal problems.  The leader of the empire, Tsaph Katta, was nearly slain by the great lord Seru in an assassination attempt.  Seru was the leader of an internal group that was much more strict, and argued with Katta over many things, including considering letting dark elves into the Empire.  Following the assassination attempt, the followers of Katta, who would later call themselves the Loyalists, packed up their belongings and travelled to Luclin, powered by advanced magics from their master geomancer Grieg.  They arrived in the Nexus, lived briefly in the area that is now Shadow Haven before finding their way to the surface and establishing Katta Castellum.

The group led by Seru would not be easily avoided, however, and his group, who the Loyalists refer to as the Inquisition, followed the Loyalists to Luclin.  This group set up Sanctus Seru, which is now a strict police state where they watch their own citizens as much as they do outsiders.  While not good, they are completely intolerant of evil races and will kill them on sight.

The last group was the unfortunate Vah Shir.  Caught between the Erudites and the Heretics on Odus, they were blasted to the moon on a chunk of Norrath created during the civil war which left the Hole on Odus.  They built their city Shar Vahl on that chunk where it lie in the crater it made on Luclin's dark side.

New Mechanics

Luclin has some new and interesting things that everyone should be aware of.

Light/Dark Side

The moon Luclin is split into light and dark sides.  These don't have an influence on gameplay itself, but in an odd irony, the evil peoples tended to move to the light side, and the good peoples moved to the dark side.

Alternate Advancement

Alternate Advancement (AA) skills are a perk for people level 50+ in the game.  This is basically a set of enhanced abilities that you can purchase with experience points.  By putting experience points into the AA pool, you will gain skill points.  These skill points can be used to by AA skills.  The lowest level and cheapest of these are advancements in things like base statistics (like +2 to Wisdom, for instance).  You can also increase your run speed up to be as fast naturally as slow SoW speeds.  The next tier is sort of related to your class.  These require a minimum level and also a minimum expenditure on the lower level AA skills, and they also cost more.  These will give bonuses to casting abilities if you are a caster, combat abilities as a warrior, etc.  The last tier is usually very high level (59+) and gives very specific, powerful special abilities to your class.  These are unique to each class.  These range from instant kill attacks by warrior-types to the ability to use camoflage as a skill for druids.

The Vah Shir

The Vah Shir are very similar to the kerrans on Norrath, however their culture is more advanced than those on Norrath.  They have a new class called the Beastlord, which can call up a Warder to protect themselves.  Most of their abilities are similar to a Shaman with heavy emphasis on their pet buffs.  The Vah Shir can also be Bards, Rogues, Shamans, and Warriors.  They are on tolerable terms with the other larger groups on Luclin.

Pets

A new feature of pets in this game is that they will travel with you from zone to zone.  This is especially useful for the Beastlord, who casts up to a dozen buffs on their pets at a time.  Also, the elementals have new models.

Horses

Horses are an alternate mode of travel around Luclin.  They are very expensive, ranging from 10,000 plat to over 100,000 plat depending on your charisma, and can be purchased in the stable in the Bazaar.  When you get them, you receive a whip.  Using the whip will summon your horse and you will immediately mount it.  The horses speed is anywhere from a slow SoW to much faster than SoW or Selo's Accelerando, depending on price.  You are able to fight from horseback, but not well.  Your horse will go with you from zone to zone.  To dismount, you click on the icon to remove it, and your horse will vanish.

Teleportation around Luclin

The Nexus is a hub of all teleportation.  If you cast Gate on Luclin, you will be taken to your bind spot.  Casting any other teleport spell, however, will take you to the Nexus.  From there, casting a teleport spell again will allow you to go wherever you intend to on Norrath.  The Nexus is a hub for all travel coming to and leaving Luclin.  You can also travel to and from Luclin without teleporting.  You do this by going to your friendly local Nexus teleporter, located at the four primary wizard spires, and they will zap you up to Luclin.  Coming back is just as easy, you go the appropriate teleporter within the Nexus and on a regular schedule (around half an hour real time) they activate, taking people to the surface.

Monster Traps

There is a new triggered spawn effect for monsters called monster traps (for lack of a better term).  This is where you will be walking through an area (a patch of grass, a ravine, a cluster of boulders) and monsters will spring to life around you.  What happens is that one or more monsters suddenly appear where you were walking.  If you're fast enough they may not attack you, but if not you will suddenly have several monsters on your hands.  Luckily these are generally weaker than the average monster in the area (being hatchlings or things like that) but are still dangerous.

Models/Graphics

The new addition to Luclin is that there are now many more models in the game.  All of the new models are more advanced, and the older models have improved versions you can choose to see.  This has the added benefit of making the game look very good and the movements much more lifelike, but the downside of slowing down your computer significantly, especially with zoning.  You are able to turn off specific models the first time you load up the game, and later on you can edit the eqclient.ini file to include or exclude the new models.  I suggest you check out them all, and then only include the ones you think look good.  I really like the new iksar and human models, but have turned off most of the others on my computer, for instance.

Oh well, that's all I can think of for now.  If I think of more I'll post it, but this should carry you for a bit...
