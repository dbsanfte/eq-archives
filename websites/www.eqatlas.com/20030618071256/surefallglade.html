      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      <p>Surefall Glade is the haven for the Rangers and Druids of the western 
        coast of Antonica. Nestled in a beautiful waterfell-fed dale filled with 
        the rare large trees of jaggedpine, these lovers of nature, along with 
        the residents of the nearby Qeynos, are at constant battle with destroyers 
        of nature, the worst of which are the nearby Blackburrow Clan of Gnolls.
      <h3><font size=+2>S</font>urrounding <font size=+2>A</font>reas</h3>
      <p>Qeynos Hills lies through a narrow tunnel that connects to the Glade. 
        This area of grassy hills to the north of Qeynos is the main battleground 
        between the humans and half-elves and the gnolls of Blackburrow. The druids 
        and rangers maintain, along with the guards of Qeynos, patrols around 
        the region, although they haven't been enough to curb the tide of gnolls. 
        This area is also teeming with animals that the rangers and druids love, 
        and part of the job of the patrols is to protect those from gnolls and 
        human alike.
      <p>This area has also seen recent problems with undead. Several powerful 
        necromancers have been known to appear in the hills on occasion, bringing 
        with them the undead. Again, these have been fought off at great cost, 
        but the war still continues.
      <h3><font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
        <font size=+2>S</font>urefall <font size=+2>G</font>lade</h3>
      <p>Surefall Glade is reachable through a narrow tunnel that enters the impassable 
        hills that mark the northern edge of Qeynos Hills. Qeynos has posted guards 
        at that entrance, while the rangers and druids extend their patrols into 
        the hills themselves. Travelling due north from Qeynos will bring one 
        to the entrance to Surefall Glade.
      <h3><font size=+2>L</font>ocal <font size=+2>C</font>olor</h3>
      <p><b>Places</b> 
      <p>Surefall Glade is considered one of the wonders of Norrath, with the 
        huge trees that fill the Glade, maintained by the druids, and the huge 
        waterfall that feeds them. As a whole, the entire area is very peaceful 
        and well-kept. The tunnels that lie behind the waterfall are the residence 
        of a community of bears that thrive under the same protection the rangers 
        and druids give to their trees.
      <p><b>People</b> 
      <p>The only powerful rangers and druids on the entire west coast of Antonica 
        are found in Surefall Glade, creating a haven for nature and for young 
        trainees in their ways. All rangers and druids in this part of the world 
        eventually seek out the Glade for their advice and instruction.
      <p>The mighty bear Mammoth is also occasionally seen in the caves behind 
        the falls. Many still believe this massive bear is simply a legend, but 
        he is all too real, and in constant danger from the other significant 
        player in Surefall Glade.
      <p>There is a very real and serious problem with poachers in the Glade and 
        the nearby areas. The rangers and druids are on constant patrol for them, 
        and one druid can regularly be seen making rounds through the tunnels 
        looking for them. Mammoth is, sadly, considered to be a great prize for 
        the poacher who finally fells him, and his life is in constant danger.
