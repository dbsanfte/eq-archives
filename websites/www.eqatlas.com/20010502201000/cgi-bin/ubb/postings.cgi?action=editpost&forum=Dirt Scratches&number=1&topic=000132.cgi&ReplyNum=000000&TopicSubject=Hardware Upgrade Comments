<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">Hail!  Here is the repost from my main page, feel free to comment...

I also figured I'd ask for some thoughts on the advancement of EQ in terms of technology.  Recently Verant had a forced update to DirectX 7.0a, which also required a lot of people to update video card and sound card drivers.

What made me think of this is the fact that currently I'm not able to play EQ because the computer I'm on isn't powerful enough.  However, about two months after the game came out, I was able to do so.  It was slow, and I didn't wander too close to huge newbie areas or anything cuz of the lag, but otherwise it wasn't too bad.  Now, however, I'm relegated to little places where there's no other players or groups and small rooms, so my poor computer doesn't have to swap textures much.

I'll be the first to say that I don't know how I feel about this.  On the one hand, for a game that is out for years and is on computers, obviously there is some advancement in the computer field, and it would be foolish for the people who made the game to not try and keep up with this in some way.  On the other hand, say I had purchased this game a while ago and didn't have a lot of money (as most assuredly a lot of gamers do not), and all of a sudden, the game I've been enjoying has suddenly become unplayable on my computer due to "advancement."  All that time and money I sank into it have been lost, because I'm no longer able to play it.  And the costs of upgrading a system are not cheap, $1/MB for RAM (roughly), video boards with at least 16 MB of RAM and that aren't Voodoo are at least $100.  It racks up to at least $200 to make a system that is now unplayable to just be playable, not even *really* playable.

The reason I ask this is that one of my long-term projects is to compile a sort of "manifesto" of what an online role-playing game should consist of.  I think that there may be a "right" way to do all of this that simply hasn't been produced yet, and if I work out what that is, the game design would follow easily after that to create an incredible game.  At least that's the theory.   :)  I'd like some people to respond to how this part of online games, hardware upgrades through time, affect the game.
