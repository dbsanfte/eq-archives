We do plan to stay in Kunark for our careers and gate back only for training.<P>So, where first and any tips would be greatly appreciated.<P>------------------<BR>Inyx D'Ater<BR>Vicar of Innoruuk<BR>Guildmistress of Rune of Flame<BR>Lanys T'Vyl</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Multiply</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">First off do not stay in FV to hunt. To many very high level creatures wondering about. Instead follow the river to the Lake of Ill Omen. At that level I would hunt at the goblin ruins right where the river flows into the lake. If you pull Goblins from the ruins be prepared. They will more than likely aggro 2 or 3 at a time on you. Not just the warriors that you can see but Soothsayers and Spirit Callers. Very tuff kills even for a group of high teen players. The wondering creatures are abundent. The Sabertooth canines sell for 1pp+ each. I hunt in that zone all the time so if you have any questions let me know.<P>Various Lv 16 Necro</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Multiply</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">PS - Make sure to bring food and water. FV will be the closest place you can buy. Also at that lv I do not recomend pulling from goblin ruins.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Vaun_Erdrick</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Are you insane?  I gained levels 23-27 in Lake of Ill Omen.  The gobbos there will be Flashing Neon Red to anyone under 16.  There are places for lower levels to fight, but I have never been to any of them.  From what I have heard, Field of Bone and Kurn's Tower would be good places for you to try out.  Some of the lower levels in our guild frequent those locales.  Good luck, and check out this site's guides.  They will help you out tremedously.<P>Vaun Erdrick &lt;Souls of Light&gt;<BR>32nd Paladin<BR>Druzzil Ro<p>[This message has been edited by Vaun_Erdrick (edited 08-24-2000).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Zxet</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Unfortunetaly there issnt a good place for 7-9 to hunt in Kunark (non Iksar). You cannot bind in Cabilis without killin 500 or so Goblins (level 21+)to get faction enough to get to non KOS level(dubious). Swamp of no hope, Lake of Ill Omen, Field of bone, and very immediate areas outside Cabilis in Warsliks Woods have some lower critters, but there are guards very close to there. You will need to stick to Antonica and Faydwer. I suggest you make an Iksar and explore a bit, by the time you take a boat, run the land, get to your destination in kunark assuming you sont die, you could have an iksar well on his way to level 7. Give it a shot, they are fun  <IMG SRC="http://www.eqatlas.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>~Zxet Ren`Zith<BR>49 Dark Elf Shadowknight<BR>~Druzzil Ro</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Shivv</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">You can hunt in Lake of Ill omen at that level.  Hike up along the river, and then head west, till you come to the lake, then head NNE.  You should see these large towering columns, which marks the newbie areas from the mid teens area.  There are goblin hunters (around lvl 9ish and social), scalebone skeletons around lvl 9 or so.  Iksar bandits around 11.  Plenty of things to kill.<P>Better yet, get a young iksar to guide you there.  Once there, you can head to the goblin hunter ruins and the scalebone ruins.  They are good hunting for those levels.  The GREAT thing about LoIO, is that you can solo on the cats (range in level from 2-4 and cover every level up to 22), pretty safely, as they are not social -- nor are the KoS, though the con scowls.  They also carry coin, which is strange for an animal.  Also, there are undead mobs, that range from lvls 7 all the way to mid 40s (elsewhere in Kunark).  A cleric could fight nothing but undead here in Kunark until he is planes ready  <IMG SRC="http://www.eqatlas.com/ubb/smile.gif"></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Slimscalley</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I agree with a few of the suggestions; the Pit in the Field of Bone I feel is the best cause there's stuff in there from around lvl 6 to 18ish, and you can keep 'em comming constantly (if you're like me and don't like to wait for people to med). Big plus: there's always people around around to help. Big minus: like stated above, can't bind in the city (unless everyone has invis to sneak in), and to my knowledge there are no non-Iksar vendors nearby.<P>The person was correct about the Lake zone, you will be able to find plenty of things that match your ability near Cabilis (past the ruins) and unlike FoB, guards no not patrol out here.  From the river from FV, head right by the Lake, and where you need to turn is just a short ways up. Head NE from the Lake, this will take you towards Cabilis and past those ruins. If you're not heading NE, you're going the wrong way.<BR><P>------------------<BR>Slimscalley Sleeze<BR>31st ShadowKnight<BR>Rodcet Nife<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Fristol</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I think it will be next to impossible to get to the Field of Bone from FV.  You need to be invis to go from the Lake zone through the cave to the Warslik Woods zone.  It's fine if you have the invisibility spell, but if you get lost, you're trapped in a dungeon of mobs in the 20+ range that will kill you when you appear.<P>Head west from the FV zone all the way to the other zone wall (because I don't know how far west you're supposed to go before you can go North East through the canyon).  Don't go too far north east, because you're heading towards Cabilis when you go this way.  However, it will take you to creatures that are blue to yellow when you con them.<P>Fristol Serpentsole<BR>Level 40 Iksar Monk of Unholy Sacrifice<BR>Bristlebane Server</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Inyx DAter</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Well, our first night went well!  No deaths, and a fun time was had by all.<P>Well, our level range was 8-10, we moved through the Lake of Ill Omen up towards the Cabilis.  Started relatively close with blues then eventually made it out to the lake side where we found sabertooth cats, tigresses, goblin battlemasters, and sarnaks.<P>After a night of fun the group is now 9-11 and I think we will probably stay there atleast another night or two.<P>Any suggestions on when we should head to FoB and Kurn's Tower?<P>Also, any estimate on how many goblins and sarnak we need to kill to get dubious in Cabilis?<p>[This message has been edited by Inyx DAter (edited 08-29-2000).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Fristol</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Field of Bone and Kurn's Tower are good until you reach level 25 or so.  It's getting there that's a pain  <IMG SRC="http://www.eqatlas.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>Fristol Serpentsole<BR>Level 40 Iksar Monk of Unholy Sacrifice<BR>Bristlebane Server</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Savok</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Just wanted to let you know that you can start hunting FoB at about lvl 7 or 8 (lower if in a group) on the far end away from Kurns tower.  As you level up keep moving closer to Kurn's.  By the time you start hunting on the otherside of the dragon bones your ready for kurns.  Move in and stay till about level 18.  You could stay longer if you want(or solo) but if i were you I would head for the lake of ill omen.  Thats my two-cents.<P></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Lalkin</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">If you want to hunt in Kunark there is really only one choice. Kurn's tower!!<P>This place is great. I went there at lvl 6 with my iksar monk and at lvl 9 with my dwarf cleric. You can bind in the ruins that the Karsenoa entrance is in and then take the short jog to kurns. <P>The only problem is you have to go to FV or the OT for vendors and banking. As my dwarf I have vowed to hunt spiders until they are low green to exact revenge upon them. God I hate the spiders in FV! =)<P>Anyways, kurns is great. don't go in to the basement until lvl 14-15 and even then it is dangerous for groups that aren't cautious. Also, while some people complain about the pathing in kurns once you learn it it make for some easy pulls. <P>Oh, to get there from FV. =)<P>Run north from the FV outpost to the west zone to the swamp of no hope. You need sow and/or invis for this. Once you have done it several times you can get there without either if you are careful.<P>Once in swamp of no hope run norht along the West zone edge until you hit cabilis, skirt that and run to the zone to Field of bone. FYI, the swamp is easy but a longer run than FV.<P>Then run north in the FOB, the big ruin you see after clearing the trees is where you can bind. Then run north some more and you can see Kurn's Tower.<P>I also HIGLY reccomend you keep maps for FV, the swamp, FoB, and Kurn's handy. They are so helpful. =)<p>[This message has been edited by Lalkin (edited 07-10-2001).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">carternet</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Just in case you were wondering - and was tired of CR's in the run from FV to LOIO there is an easy way past the spiders.<P>In the middle of the FV port area are two tunnels . one has the captain in it andis underwater.  The others is long and dark but leads up to the far bank away from the spiders (unless they are trained there)  There is also a guard there who will kill the spiders should you geta chance to run.  Simply hug the wall past the entrance to DL and up the waterfall.<P>I use this route all the time even as a 45 WAR!  <BR>GL<P>Basho<BR><P>------------------<BR>Basho Matsuo<BR>Hooded Nomads<BR>Warrior Of Saryrn</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
