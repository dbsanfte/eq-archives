I'm going to write as much as I can before I run out of time, hopefully I'll get all of it down...<P>First off, the Everquest-related stuff.  Realize that I have not gotten a full demo of all of these, simply saw them in action.  Allakhazam will be posting up something today about them, since he meets with them this morning sometime.  Also, the Sony booth was one of those "nobody sees anything without an appointment" booths at E3.  It was mildly amusing to watch the guard lady kicking out me, Alla, and Illia yesterday since we were only in there on temporary passes and not for a full demo, and some guy from a LA paper was scheduled to be where we were standing.  They certainly know who their primary audience is...<BR> <IMG SRC="confused.gif" border="0"> <P>Planes of Power.  This looked good, basically no change from the Luclin engine as far as I could tell.  They were showing a tape of this battle over and over again (at least that's what I think, I saw it on two separate days and it was the same battle at the same point).  Basically it seems like a high-level content expansion.  Non-powergamers need not apply (or waste the $$).<P>EQ2.  Some other sites must have seen stuff I missed.  I kept getting the same view of a castle that demo'ed weather effects followed by a little tour down a spiral staircase.  These all looked good.  Which at this point means nothing, a tech demo that doesn't look good would be a waste.  Not much to say about this.<P>Everquest Adventures.  This is the Playstation one.  Basically a watered down EQ that you can play on your Playstation.  I didn't spend too much time looking at this either.<P>Everquest Atlas.  They announced a book version of maps, but these aren't my maps.  Apparently they are making their own maps and a book out of it.  They weren't too forthcoming with me about what this meant, but they said more to other news people and that's what I gathered.  Very nice...  <IMG SRC="confused.gif" border="0"><P>Star Wars Galaxies.  This looked really good graphically.  It felt like you were really in the world, which it should since I'm betting they got the computer models for a lot of stuff right from LucasArts.  You could one of about 8 alien races, and there weren't really classes (as far as I could tell).  You could also tweak your own personal appearance using a lot of different variables.<P>They also ran through a quest, where you talk to people using a click interface to choose different dialogue, and then are given a quest.  The place we had to go to was lit up by a light from the skies, so we headed over there.  When we got there there were a few other guys around (they were live on the alpha test server) doing the same quest apparently, which basically involved attacking some storm troopers around a power generator thing in order to talk to this guy under the light from heaven.  You double click on the enemy, and open fire.  You can stand, kneel, or lie on the ground.  This is where it got a bit boring, and I don't think this is SWG's fault, but all the games in this genre.  How do you make a shooting game that is so fun when twitch is involved fun when the twitch is removed?  I'm not so sure.  We could have stood up and walked away from that battle for a beer and come back to loot when it was over.  We'll have to see what else they can come up with to spice up the battle.<P>They also mentioned that the expansion will contain space shuttles to move off planet, but the initial release you will be planet-bound.  Land Wars anyone?<P>That's it for Sony stuff.  That's about all I could get from two rushed five minute stints in the booth.  On to the more interesting stuff.<P>Asheron's Call 2.  This game looked really awesome in all respects.  We had a little tour with Jason Booth on Wednesday, which showed us a lot about it.  For anyone who played AC and quit (like myself) you may remember that the game seemed good, but wasn't quite "there" whatever that means.  Well this game is "there".<P>You start out by choosing one of 3 races, Lugian, Tumerok, or Human.  Lugians are the massive ogre-type guys, good at battle.  Tumeroks are these funky bipedal lizard/cat-like critters (they're hard to describe).  Humans are the standard.  You don't choose starting stats at all.  From there on, you get skills, and the game is a skill-based game.<P>The way the skills work is also unusual.  There are several different skill trees that you can advance up, such as Melee, Missile, Magic, and a few others.  Using skill points you can purchase a skill on the tree, which is basically at a node, and then once you own that you can later choose any skills up the tree that have this as a requirement.  These skills give you special abilities that you can hotkey and use, or that are constant abilities.  You can also advance these after you have purchased them by dumping experience points into them.  This increases how good they are, and also how good skills up the tree are from them.  Jason specifically mentioned that this was not like Diablo because there you simply rushed to the end of the tree and then maxed out those final skills.  Here it pays to max them out as you go along.  If you screw up, don't worry, you can buy back skills and reinvest the points elsewhere.  The only limitation is a time one, where you can't repeatedly buy back and swap skills within minutes of each other for different encounters.<P>Leveling basically buys you more hps, and you get more skill points to spend on the above skills at every level.  Early on you get probably 5 per level, but at higher levels you only get 1, so the advancement is slower and you need to pick a specialty.<P>The graphics in the game looked incredible.  We were looking at it on a GeForce4 Ti 4400 graphics board, and it looked really good.  Your guys run around a huge, real world with grass everywhere, clouds and stars overhead, water rippling as you swim through it.  Special graphical goodies included you being able to see graphically how much damage you and others have taken by either the blood on your skin or dented and scraped armor.<P>The music, which unfortunately we weren't able to experience in full glory because of some serious technical problems with Windows XP (yes it's a piece of crap, even Microsoft can't keep it running), was really incredible too.  They plan on having musical scores for each individual area, and also musical scores for each type of creature.  When you are walking through an area, you will hear that area's musical score, and then when a monster gets close, its score will be dynamically added in, so you know something is up.  This all happens smoothly, and promises to be neat.<P>Combat looked great as well.  You basically target a monster and hit the attack button and go to town.  There is the concept of opening attacks, where if you hit something just right (or whatever happens, I don't really know) they flash with a yellow light around them.  This means they are open to another special attack, which you can do for more damage or knockdown or whatever you want.  These special attacks are part of the skill tree.  We got to see him fighting a pair of humanoid snakes with large weapons, and it was realistic and very creepy.  He also got his butt kicked.   <IMG SRC="wink.gif" border="0"> <P>Monsters have a pretty advanced AI, which we didn't really see (not sure if it's done yet).  They have varying aggro radii, they will communicate and act in unison on different things, and he mentioned that a shaman could call back troops from the front line to guard or heal it, as an example.  It will be interesting to see if this comes through as promised, but could be a great advance in gameplay if it does (no more pulling or trains, in other words).<P>The world itself, as I said, looked really good.  Jason mentioned that it's probably a bit smaller than the original game, but that's because they didn't want people to have to travel forever to get to places.  There's a map that you can zoom in and out only once right now, and they plan on "enhancing" it before they let you zoom in and out more.<P>Lastly, the storyline sounds even more interesting than the old one.  At the beginning of the game, much of the land will be in ruin, and there will be many quests players can do to rebuild it to a functioning area.  Towns will go from ruins to bustling areas filled with shops.<P>Also, the PvP aspect sounds cool as well.  There are factioned areas that are open for combat and that people can gain control of.  For instance, a guild could gain control of a specific area for themselves, and some of the monsters in that area might be factioned as well, so if you were to kill them off initially, they will respawn on your side and only attack your enemies.<P>What's in it from the old AC: Skill-based system, Allegiances, lifestones and teleporters<P>What's gone: the need for arrows, spell creation, vast expanses of nothing<P>There's a lot more to it, but I'm running low on time.   <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"><P>Shadowbane.  I sat in on a demo for this game.  My short version of my thoughts is that this game will probably be the best game out there for people who like PvP, since that predominates the thinking and gameplay.  They have some really innovative ideas for this as well.  However, their graphics are really on par with the first generation MMOG's and not with soon-to-be-released titles like AC2 or even Luclin that just came out.  It remains to be seen if they can get enough people to play it to make their ideas work.<P>World of Warcraft.  This game looks to be a big player when it comes out.  The graphics are also incredible, and on par with AC2, but of a much more cartoonish nature.  They actually look very very similar to the graphics in Warcraft III, so they definitely feel like they're taken from the same world.  The interface is also more organic and should appeal to less hardcore gamers as well.  The gameplay looks fun, with battle seeming really epic (we were watching a troll shaman and a minotaur taking out this giant wolfman, and it looked awesome).  Spell effects are incredible, and the whole world looked awesome.<P>What remains to be seen with this game is how the very fast pace of action and advancement and relatively small world (I'm not sure about that last, but that's the sense I got) will move over to this genre where people spend more time playing a game than working at their regular jobs.  On the bright side, this may very well be the game that bridges the gap between MMOG's and the casual gamer, which has traditionally been totally left out of the cool stuff cuz they have other things to do with their time than camp an uber spawn.<P>This was a short review, but I think the game looked great and can't think of anything bad to say about it.  It's also a ways off from release I think, although it looked very playable in the demo I saw.<P>Hmm, what else did I see.  Oh, Neverwinter Nights...<P>This game looked great.  It really seemed to have everything it had been hyped up to have.  The graphics looked even better when you see it played, I personally haven't been too impressed with the screenshots, but it looked good.  It also has a very very nice DM's interface that will allow you to control the games with ease.  I think just the idea of having a group of your friends be able to play D&D with each other on the computer is going to be incredible.  Most of what I saw was not new, but my impression of it was very positive.<P>Lastly, the booth babes were out.  E3 in general seemed more tame than last year, and there seemed to be less barely- and tightly-clad flesh paraded around.  What was there was very nice, though.  It made me realize I need a girlfriend, preferably one who plays video games, or who can fake like she doesn't mind that I do.   <IMG SRC="wink.gif" border="0"> <P>Anyway, that's it for now.  If I think of more I'll add it to this thread.<P>--------------------<P>Muse<BR>Bard and Cartographer
