<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">I have viewed each of the posts and I am a bit suprised that no one has remarked on the wonders of the new upgrade Verant has done.  After doing everything I was instructed to do and the big patch day was over, I logged on and sat there stunned for quite sometime.  The graphics were so far improved that I immediately began taking screen shots.  In the distance a fog rolls across the land, rain and snow actually moves with the wind and does not just fall to the land, and the mobs colors were more vibrant than they ever had been before.

The new hot box set up and the new additions and improvements they have made were nothing short of breath taking.  I would think as a bard you would understand how important those extra boxes can be.  I have a spot for every instrument and two primary weapons at the ready at all times and all in one hot box set up, along with a sit and a social command for assist.  This has improved my gameplay by leaps and bounds.

However, I must wonder if the new upgrade that was forced upon us... for good or bad... is Verants preparation for the new expansion that is to come.  With the improvements that I have seen with the game i am very excited about the new expansion and will be the first in line to get the game, and hopefully one of the first to step off that gnome boat into the middle of some icey wonderland waiting to be explored.

What it comes down to is the people I have met on the game are extraordinary to say the least, the gameplay is like no other I have ever seen, and the attention that Verant gives it's some two hundred thousand subscribers is nothing but amazing.  The very prospect that me and a few good friends may get to stumble across a mob that has never been seen, or loot an item that has never been looted, or zone in somewhere that has never been explored is enough I need to make up-grades and PC adjusments as dictated by those who have created such a wonderful world for us.

But then, I am on a 750 mhz Athalon with a 16 MB ATI All In Wonder Video Capture Card, so anything they can put out I am relatively comforted to know that this monster can handle it.</TEXTAREA>
