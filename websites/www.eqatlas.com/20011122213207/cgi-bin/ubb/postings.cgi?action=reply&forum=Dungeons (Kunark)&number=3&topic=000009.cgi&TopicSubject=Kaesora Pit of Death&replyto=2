[B]Ok, I had to respond to this one.

I have spent well over 10 hours camping outside the Library.
The ONLY times trains came is when we wanted them, using
our high level Warrior to pull them for us.

Unless they randomly decided to change some weird
pathing, either you were being trained or someone was
doing something weird.

Kaesora is like an ATM to us.  Run in, fight down to the
Library, HOPE that you get a strathbone shield (yah, right),
kill the librarian until we each have a Spirit Tome.  Grab 
whatever other rare drops fall.  Head over the the Church
and kill there for awhile, gaining a little XP.  Heck, if
we planned ahead we have all sold our Dusty Ransackers
packs.  Everyone WILL get one of those if you camp
here for any real length of time.

Perhaps kill some spiders to KEEP TRYING to get the
stupid shield.  Continue to not get it.

And you will get about 40 Fine Steel 2handed Staves..;-)

Love the place..

It has two levels worth of a drop, and some of us fell to the very bottom, as we did not know how to jump in, or realize there where 2 lvls we could fall to.  end result all but 2 died ( they gated )<BR>corpse retrival caused me 3 more deaths, as invis would fade, and there are 10 to 15 spiders there that mob you as soon as that happens.  But I eventually pulled all the corpse to were they could be pulled to the top lvl in stages.<P>next we try going to the library, working our way slowly around.  we end up in the long hallway infront of the library.  the SK is pulling from there clearing the path.  when a train of 5 spiders ( who are NO WHERE NEAR where we were hunting show up. will the SK had pulled a couple of mobs from the library area.  <P>end result - we all die again<P>another hour and a half of courpse retrival later we actually get into the library! woo hoo ! we are there.  Very nice looking area btw.<P>here we realize that we have to redo our groups, as we were getting there we found that half the Mobs in the zone would decrease Ventril faction.  for those who are not an evil race, this is not a problem.  But for those of us who are it is very bad.  Ventril faction is with the ONLY evil accessible city in Kunark.  You let this get to bad and you have to take a very long boat ride back to Antonica to do any banking etc.  also you will never buy those high lvl spells ( if you can ever reach that lvl )<P>so we change up the grouping to a good group and an evil group.  seemed to be working fairly well, until once again a train from no where appears.  ( there were no pets at all to train them to us, and we never left to room )   3 times when inside the room this happened while I was there.<P>eventually I had to log along with a couple of others, leaving a group of 6<BR>43 Sk<BR>40 paly<BR>40 sk<BR>40 cleric<BR>30 warrior<BR>29 cleric<P>they lost their bodies again.<P>then 2 lvl 55's came in, a cleric and a chanter.  they went with my friends to the library rezed them all. and while they were discussing the best way to get out, once again the train.<P>they all died<P>now, if we as a group of lvl 30 to 40 attack a lvl 55 the out come is we die.  How can a group of low 30 mobs take out 4 lvl 40's 2 lvl 55s ( even discounting the others )<BR>it is not like there were 2 to one odds in the mobs favor.  and WTF is with the trains showing from nowhere land?<P>Needless to say I will never go into Kaesora again, there is nothing there that is worth it to me.  the only way I will return would be if be some miracle I ever get to 55, and return with my friends with them at lvl 60 and just kill everything there.<P>but then again....... the trains may come and how do I know we would not all die again?<P>sorry bout the huge rant.<P>the main thing I wanted people to get from this was the bad faction for evil races <P>and the ridiculous trains from the twilight zone.<P>Muse's maps say this zone is good for a group of mid to high 30's.  I do not agree....<P>Runteater <BR>Shaman who excels in death...<BR>his own<P><BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">tanyen</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I agree with Muse and you both a doable dungeon and a nasty one.   First time I went in (Lvl 40 or so), I did a /who and found out only mid-40s and higher were found inside the dungeon.  Next I noticed there were 2 corpses on the floor near zone.  I thought to myself, I had better find a group.  I shouted  lvl 40 druid lfg.  Silence, no response from anybody (Probably everybody was snickering at me).  After waiting for a few minutes I figured I will explore dungeon. I camoflagued myself and slowly walked down ramp.   I went to first intersection; bam, wham, slam, I was accosted by an undead mob.  It hit hard and it hurt.  I turned and ran. I barely escaped the dungeon with less than a bulb of health.  I thought Muse must be a wise-guy; he just wants to see how many people can die doing this dungeon.  <P>Five seasons later, I returned with a group of 5 looking for silk from healer spiders, I told everybody this place is tough. We buffed up and had our evacs ready to go just in case<BR>          2 - Lvl 45 Druids (Healer,Nuker)<BR>          1 - Lvl 46 Bard (Mana battery)<BR>          1 - Lvl 41 Monk (Tank)<BR>          1 - Lvl 39 Shaman (Tank Buff)<BR>Next we slowly went inside, clearing each room and hallway as we went.  We snared everything to prevent trains.  Finally found <BR>our campsite and monk pulled mob towards us.  These mobs attack in groups of 2-3 so we had to root one or two of them (bring Enchanter is good idea and no Shaman Pet) to prevent us from being overwhelmed.  It was a very successful raid (about 2 hr) and we picked up 1 Frost Dagger, 1 Kylong War Dagger, 2 Healer Silks, Ancient Coin for Bard, No Drop Whip for Druid, and some other stuff that I forgot. <P>Note:  Some Mob conned Green to Lvl 45 Druid therefore, no experience.<BR>  </FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Gryfalia</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Ok, I had to respond to this one.<P>I have spent well over 10 hours camping outside the Library.<BR>The ONLY times trains came is when we wanted them, using<BR>our high level Warrior to pull them for us.<P>Unless they randomly decided to change some weird<BR>pathing, either you were being trained or someone was<BR>doing something weird.<P>Kaesora is like an ATM to us.
