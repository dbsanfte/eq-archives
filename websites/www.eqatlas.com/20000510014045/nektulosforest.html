      <h3> <font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      Nektulos Forest is a dark forest that lies north of the Commonlands on the 
      eastern half of Antonica. It is home to a clan of halflings, and is also 
      patrolled by the dark elves from nearby Neriak. It also represents the newbie 
      zone for the dark elves from Neriak. 
      <h3> <font size=+2>D</font>angers</h3>
      This area represents the newbie area for the dark elves, although the area 
      is very small. The largest danger with the newbie area is that most of the 
      monsters there will group with others of their kind, and because it is so 
      small, one has to be careful to let the others get far enough away from 
      their spawn spot so that they don't join in and send you running for the 
      guards. 
      <p>The other large problem is that the wandering monsters (pretty much only 
        skeletons and wolves) are aggressive and will attack you. This can be 
        fairly annoying as guards are only present at the bridge and the entrances 
        to Neriak and Lavastorm. The Guardians will also attack good races, although 
        they leave the evil races alone. On top of this, the orc runner occasionally 
        makes a dash for the Neriak entrance. He is approximately 9th level, and 
        his presence will make the normally benevolent dark elf guards attack 
        ogres and trolls in the area, which is something to be careful of. 
      <p>The last problem with this area, which isn't really a danger, is that 
        this is, in my opinion, one of the worst designed areas in the game. I've 
        started a character in every newbie area of the game and got to 5th level 
        or so everywhere, and this area is by far the worst. The reasons are plenty, 
        but basically the newbie area is very small, and wandering outside of 
        it is very dangerous as 4th level wolves will attack and kill you. Therefore, 
        if there are a large number of newbies there is very little to kill in 
        this area. Also, once you reach 4th or 5th and start wandering a little 
        bit further, Guardians are around you all the time. It's very frustrating 
        to almost die in a battle with a skeleton, feel that you're going to win, 
        and then have some stupid Guardian come up and kill it. Tada, no experience, 
        no loot, 5 minutes of resting to recover. Another problem is that the 
        creatures in this area don't give any significant loot. Unlike many other 
        areas, it is difficult to find bags or boxes, rusty weapons, cash, bits 
        of armor, etc on any of the monsters that you can hunt. Instead you get 
        spiderling silks, ruined pelts, and fire beetle eyes. Note that none of 
        these stack, so you'll be running back into town (and be zoning at least 
        twice to get the best prices) about every 5 minutes. Needless to say, 
        when I hit 4th level, I packed my bags and relocated to the swamps of 
        the ogres and trolls. At least there I could get cash, maybe a cracked 
        staff, and some netted armor for my enchanter... 
      <h3> <font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>
      As I mentioned above, I don't see much in the way of benefits in adventuring 
      in this zone. There are a few places that are campable with a small group, 
      most notably the halfling ruins (if you are evil) and the undead spawn spots, 
      but other than those, random hunting is not very profitable in this area. 
      <h3> <font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
        <font size=+2>N</font>ektulos <font size=+2>F</font>orest</h3>
      From the south there is a pass that leads into the Eastern Commonlands near 
      Freeport. Through here dark elves can access the vast world beyond. 
      <p>The entrance to Neriak lies in the northeastern corner on the east wall, 
        and has a path leading nearby. The entrance to Lavastorm Mountains lies 
        in the northwestern corner on the north wall.
