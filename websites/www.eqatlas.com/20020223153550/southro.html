      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      <p>Southern Desert of Ro marks the southern edge of the vast and dangerous 
        Desert of Ro. It is the home base for the orcs that have spread northward 
        into the desert proper, and their huts literally cover the grassy region 
        next to the moister Innothule Swamp to the south. 
      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>angers </h3>
      <p>This zone is quite dangerous, especially if you didn't reach it by travelling 
        through the much more dangerous northern Desert of Ro, in which case it 
        seems like safe haven in comparison. This zone is a lower level zone than 
        the Oasis of Marr to the north, and there are far fewer Sand Giants roaming 
        the dunes, as well as fewer madmen. There are, however, more undead running 
        around, including frequent ghouls and the occasional dry bone skeleton. 
        All of these will attack you on sight. 
      <p>Orcs are also present in large quantities. This is great for hunting 
        purposes, and is the next step up for many trolls and ogres from the south 
        once they reach 6th or 7th level and can group up. The grassy region, 
        however, is very hilly, and it's easy to stumble across a camp that you 
        didn't know was there. Luckily, it's an easy trek to Innothule Swamp. 
        Of note, however, that good races will likely only be bound in Freeport 
        at the closest, and a death here is 20 minutes of real life running to 
        reclaim your corpse. 
      <p>Recently there has been an increase in the risk of travelling through 
        this area. The undead have been more prevalent, and types of stronger 
        undead never before seen in this part of the desert have started appearing, 
        including stronger mummies. Also, more snakes and spiders, the most frightening 
        of which is the Terrorantula, which I believe was named by a group of 
        drunken Barbarians... 
      <h3><font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>
      <p>This area is like a higher level version of North Ro, and provides some 
        good hunting for solo's up to level 20 and groups up to level 17 or so, 
        depending on their size. It is also generally uncrowded, and you can take 
        out orc camps all day without much competition. 
      <p>The Dervish Cutthroat camps in this area are also less frequently camped, 
        normally, and tend to be a bit tougher than the camps to the north. With 
        the addition of the very frequent wandering monster attack, these camps 
        are tougher than the ones in North Ro. 
      <p>The merchant camp in the middle is a good place to sell for the evil 
        races that aren't like elsewhere. They will also sell to people that they 
        like from the &quot;good&quot; races as well, although will refuse service 
        to most.
      <p>The other plus is that Ortallius and Rathmana are here. I haven't done 
        either of their quests, but Rathmana offers an interesting bargain where 
        you pay to pull out a random scroll, and is apparently the end of some 
        other quest that I haven't discovered yet. 
      <h3><font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
        <font size=+2>S</font>outhern <font size=+2>D</font>esert of <font size=+2>R</font>o</h3>
      <p>In the middle of the ridge of mountains that covers the northern edge 
        of the zone lies a pass that leads to the Oasis of Marr. This pass is 
        extremely deadly on the Oasis side, as Sand Giants regularly patrol in 
        front of it, and madmen seem to live there. You will learn to see the 
        notch in the mountains from the other end of the Oasis before long... 
      <p>On the southwestern edge lies the pass to Innothule Swamp, the home of 
        the trolls and hunting grounds for the frogloks. Further through the swamp 
        lies Guk, the home of the frogloks, as well as the Feerott, the forest 
        home of the lizard men, the ogres, and other far more dangerous evils. 
      <p>This also lies along the little taken southern route from Freeport to 
        Qeynos. It requires intimate knowledge of the terrain to do safely if 
        you are not from an evil race, but may be safer in the long run than the 
        northern route.
