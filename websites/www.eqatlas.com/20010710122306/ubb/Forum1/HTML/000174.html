</FONT><HR><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Lets face it, currently there are alot of people who are just plain upset about the things that are going on in Everquest, and with a slew of new games coming out it isn't hard to see the mass exodus commencing.... <BR>Right now people are upset about many different issues, and almost none of them appear to be things that Verant wants to work on, or for that matter has even considered...<P>Verant decides after months of whining about "My class this" that they will "balance the classes", and so far, their way of balancing is hurting more than it is helping... Players gave their ideas for balancing, but Verant still decided on their own how they felt it best to "balance" things.. Verant continues to change things as they see fit to try and maintain "class interdependence" and the overall player reaction has been less than satisfied...<P>Clerics have been complaining forever about their healing nerf, the higher level characters have been complaining about the "difficulty" of the epic encounters in Velious (as well as getting their "epic" weapons), and higher levels have been complaining about the "risk vs. reward" problem... These players are highly upset, and rightly so, because there is really no fun when things are so incredibly difficult to accomplish..<P>Verant wants to discourage people from camping/farming, and many players have been very vocal about this needing to be removed... Verant then gives these same campers a mini-game to play while waiting for things to spawn, and then one patch later creates something to try and eliminate camping (for now, only in ONE new zone) which makes their actual position even less understood.. This can only create further problems between the two opposing sides of this issue, and lots of people are upset, and Verant ceratainly isn't helping things... <P>Recently, the original two planes were given an overhaul, mostly because of the epic weapon fiasco... This makes the mid-level players who had expected to one day go there, even less likely to make it to a "god" encounter.. Every casual gamer should be upset about this because, as one of the first truly "epic" encounters that they could have hoped to attempt... This puts them effectively out of the running until they reach extreme high levels (and most casual gamers never expect to get that high). How could the casual gamer not be upset??<P>Verant also continues to adhere to their "vision" for the game, of multiplayer interaction and "class interdependence", but does nothing to try and encourage fantasy role-playing (like the game was designed around)... The current majority of players continues to claim that this isn't a role-playing game, and is driving the people the game was designed for away... Verant trying to "enforce" the naming policy has been a tremendous disaster causing more people to leave, and has made the arguements between both factions of players worse... <P>What this all boils down to is basically EVERY player in Everquest has some reason to be un-happy with their gaming experience, and Verant is doing nothing except making things worse... If Verant keeps this up they will effectively run EQ into the ground... Alot has been said recently about the upcoming Massive Multiplayer Online Games, about how this will cause people to leave, and I also see people on the boards constantly saying they'll never buy another Verant made game... <P>I'm even starting to believe that I will never find the EQ that I came looking for, one of role-playing and cooperation (and it was wonderful before it became truly popular)... I pictured Everquest as a game where people would forget their petty differences, greed and selfishness and have fun, but sadly this isn't the case... In fact with everyone upset about some aspect of this game there is more disputes in game every day, so I will probably be leaving for a new game as well...<P>All I can say is Verant, you really can design one good peice of software if the game's world can become as petty, jaded, unhappy, competitive and greedy as our real one.. Too bad you can't figure out a way to make people get along, or fix all the problems that make us human, which is why your world will not (and cannot) survive... Many players just don't have fun anymore, and I sadly am one of them...<P>/em starts saving his coppers so he can afford the next game<P>Ooooo lookie there's all of these new games coming out....<BR>/shout Will the last one out of Norrath, please turn out the lights!!<BR><P>------------------<BR>Blackivar Backbiter<BR>aka Blackivar the Cunning<BR>Redeemed Halfling Rogue<BR>30th Season<BR>Druzzil Ro Server</FONT>

</FONT><HR><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Taobob I have to disagree with you on these points.  If it is true that everyone has something to be unhappy about then VI must be doing a hell of a good job.  It has long been recognized by professional negotiators that if you come away from an arbitration with a settlement that neither side is happy with you have probably reached the best compromise possible.  If everyone has something to be unhappy about and there are two sides (at least) to all the issues then VI must be reaching the best compromise possible.<P>This is a Massive Multiplayer game.  No matter which Multiplayer game you go to you will have these same differences of opinion.  This diversity of personality types is inevitable with Massive Multiplayers.  There is absolutely nothing that VI or anyone else can do to please all these people all the time.  They can only try to provide enough of what each person likes that it overides the things they don't like.  Make the game diverse enough that there is something for everyone.<P>Sorry, but these games are an extension of life after all.  You have real people playing these games and as such they will act as their personality in Real Life dictates.  <P>I have played RP games (a lot) with just small groups and invariably the individuals play their characters with the same personality as they exibit in RL.  They bring their selfishness or their selflessness with them to the gaming table or to the key board.  An a**hole will be an a**hole, a nice guy will be a nice guy, no changing it.<P>Jacoby Justantine<BR>Paladin of Mithaniel Marr<BR>Guild Leader of the Protectors of Harmony<BR>Saryrn Server</FONT>

</FONT><HR><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Personally, I love EQ just the way it is.  It's gritty, it's frustrating, but it's also almost sickeningly rewarding to me.  I'll spend 4 hours camped somewhere with a group that can't get along to save their lives, just sitting in a corner until a creature spawns.  It can be annoying but when the fight is over and I've just dinged another level, it all seems so worth it.  The problems we're seeing with EQ aren't in the game design or in the rule setup, they're in the people who can't stop to enjoy anything for more than 3 seconds.  They always have to find something new to bitch about. <P>------------------<BR></FONT>
