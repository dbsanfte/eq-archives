<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">There is no reason whatsoever that users should have to upgrade the client and hardware after only 1-1/2 years of The game being released.  This "forced upgrade" is due to 2 reasons:  poor design and a lack of foresight. Allow me to explain:

I was pleasantly surprised the other day by some news about a game I had long since given up on: UO.  With 3rd dawn, they are adding 3D effects for those who can run a faster system.  However, this client will work *in tandem* with a player with an older, 2D client, allowing both to adventure together.

Why can EQ, arguably one of the most succesful games ever, not be able to provide a different engine to those that can use it, while other games are able to get this right? 

EQ had a dated engine when it was first released (around the time of release, I think I compared it to the Tomb Raider engine which first came out in '96 ('95?  Seems like forever). EQ was released to the public with dated graphics in the same calendar year as games such as UT and Q3, and almost a year after HL.  So, it is reasonable to assume that Verant knew they had a dated engine and would have to upgrade eventually.  Not being able to allow multiple engines to access the same code (or more importantly, allow original users to continue to access the game with the original advertised sys reqs) is indicative of porr foresight.

Not being able to handle multiple clients smells of poor design.  The majority of EQ is serevr side, with the actual maps being help on the clients machine.  The client appears to handle both the engine and the networking functions, in a basic Client - Server model. They should be able to separate the 3d-engine and the networking client from each other, allowing  a more robust system and more 3d engines to be supported.

In other words, imagine a FPS that could be accesses by someone with a Quake 1 engine, a Quake 3 engine, and even a 2-1/2D engine like the Build-engine or Daggerfall's X-ngine.  Sure, it might look lame on the lower end systems, but all the engines  use 3D maps.  The same maps, with a lower res version of the textures, and maybe even a lower polygon count (simpler objects, maybe even sprites for some of the items like tables and chairs).

Now, don't tell me this would be an incredible drain on their resources.  USers in the Quake community ported the original maps from Q1 to Q2 without the resources and income of VI.  Hell, you could re-do a Doom map in the Q3 engine for that matter (not sure if this has actually happened or not).

Now, are there other issues with this?  Sure.  I'm not saying this would solve all the problems.  But it would allow for users with lower-end systems (or those who haven't upgraded) to continue plaaying the game they've bought and paid for, and continued to pay for for a year and a half.  There is no good reason this couldn't happen, save for a lack of foresight and a poorly thought out initial design.

Ah well, thats enough of a rant for now. I am curious about what the rest of you think of a multi-client system though.
