      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      <p>The Rathe Mountains is an enormous and dangerous zone. It lies along 
        the southern route from Freeport to Qeynos. The high peaks hide away many 
        separate areas within the zone, each with its own dangers and things to 
        discover. I think that the Rathe Mountains is generally considered just 
        a confusing place to travel through, and not a place to adventure (at 
        most, I've seen one person other than myself there). 
      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>angers </h3>
      <p>This zone has many dangers in it. First of all, it is a mid-level zone. 
        Although the region to the north of the entrance from Feerrott has many 
        fire beetles to hunt, there is a great deal of overlap, and I've seen 
        skeletons and lizard men roaming the area as well. Most of the other monsters 
        were either gamble or tombstone to my 10th level ranger, or were in camps 
        with two blues and an even, for instance. There is not a great deal of 
        hunting if you are a solo adventurer here. 
      <p>The monsters here are very powerful. There are Hill Giants and Giant 
        Skeletons roaming some of the western parts of the zone, and Cyclops in 
        the northwest. Many of the undead temples are covered with powerful undead, 
        including the Dry and Ice Bone Skeletons and Giant Skeletons, as well 
        as some named creatures I didn't get a chance to view personally. Combine 
        very powerful with the fact that they are almost always in a camp or around 
        others of their kind. If you want to take on one, be sure you can take 
        on more than that as well. 
      <p>The other danger, and this applies more to the evil races, is that everything 
        here will attack you. There is a camp of paladins that will definitely 
        come after you. I also assume the protected temple's guardians will come 
        after you as well. Add to that every monster, and you've got problems. 
      <h3><font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>
      <p>Here, I will discuss the different areas within the zone and the benefits 
        of each. To the south of the Feerrott entrance lie two lizard men camps, 
        and a pair of 10th level characters could easily move between them. At 
        12th level they could move on to the orc camp as well. The two undead 
        areas, though, seem to be much more dangerous. To the north of the Feerrott 
        entrance lies an open area that is crawling with fire beetles, and the 
        occasional low-level lizard man scout. There is also a high level orc 
        camp. Nobody at the paladin camp would speak to me, but the gypsies and 
        the Inn are very helpful. 
      <p>Further to the west lies the zone where the hill giants and the giant 
        skeletons live. If you can take them on, this area would provide good 
        hunting. There are also guards that roam this area, although I have never 
        caught one to try and speak with them. North lies a temple to some evil 
        god (I assume) that is well guarded (the shaman has a pet). There is also 
        a lizard man camp that could be taken on by that pair of 10th levels. 
      <p>In the northwestern corner is the only readily accessible place to hunt 
        bears for the evil races in the south. The problem is that for every brown 
        bear, there are a bunch of grizzlies and kodiaks running around, so it's 
        dangerous to hunt here. There are also protectors from the nearby temple 
        that I believe will attack you, including one "unkempt protector" who 
        roams the area. There is another high-level orc camp here as well. In 
        front of the Lake Rathe entrance lies a creepy area with the hill that 
        reaches for the clouds. Roaming this area are cyclops and giant skeletons, 
        and the only gypsy camp that sells combine weapons this far south. 
      <h3><font size=+2>T</font>he <font size=+2>S</font>phinxes </h3>
      <p>The Sphinxes are the most unique part of this zone, and deserve their 
        own section to discuss what I know and what I've guessed on their nature. 
        I've heard that they are both extremely powerful (level 50) and that one 
        is good and the other evil. Their names are distinctive and are linked 
        with the named beetles in this zone through the first syllable (Zaza or 
        Ankh). The temples that the beetles guard are remarkably egyptian appearing, 
        as well. 
      <p>Now, what I've heard is that the northern sphinx (Ankh) is the good one, 
        and the southern (Zaza) is the evil one. When I went to /con them, however, 
        they both were ready to attack me. This leads me to wonder why that was, 
        and why the good one would want to attack me (a wood elf ranger) and I 
        think it might relate to my fight with the named beetles (Ankh). These 
        beetles initially /con'ed indifferent to me, so I approached one and tried 
        to hail it. It attacked me, and I had to fight off it and its companion. 
        After killing them, I lost faction standing with the Stone Hive Bixies 
        and gained faction with the Guardians of the Vale. Of note, killing Crushbone 
        Orcs causes the same faction adjustment. I was led to believe that they 
        were evil beetles from this, but if they are linked by name to the northern 
        sphinx, and he now wants to attack me (like the beetles, now), then maybe 
        he is the evil sphinx. This obviously warrants further investigation, 
        and I'm very tempted to kill the Zaza beetles to see what faction that 
        gives me, but I don't want to burn all my bridges. Any info on this would 
        be appreciated. 
      <h3><font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
        <font size=+2>R</font>athe <font size=+2>M</font>ountains</h3>
      <p>On the middle of the eastern edge of the zone is the entrance to Feerrott, 
        the home of the lizard men and the ogres, as well as the temple to Cazic-Thule. 
        By following the path west and taking a northward turn at the temple guarded 
        by Ankh beetles, you reach the northern corner of the Rathe Mountains. 
      <p>On the western edge in the northern part, tucked away in a corner, lies 
        the entrance to Lake Rathe. Getting to this can be tricky, as gypsies 
        (who apparently hate evil races) lie at the entrance to this valley. The 
        entrance also blends in to the surrounding area, and could easily be passed 
        without noticing it.
