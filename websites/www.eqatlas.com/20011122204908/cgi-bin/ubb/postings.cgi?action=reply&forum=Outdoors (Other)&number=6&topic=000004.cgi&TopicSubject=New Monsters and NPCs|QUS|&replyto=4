Putting them into the newbie zone with them so agressive wasnt a good idea. I had one person asking me if I had petitioned the GMs or guides to get them taken out. I hadnt but its only because its the only thing that gives me xps withougt having to venture too far from the gates. I do on occasion venture out to the hills when you get too many people wanting to steal your campsite. I do believe they should at least tone down the aggression on these things and make them at least a little easier for the newbies to take. I have a 11th season barbarian shaman, and they knock the heck out of me sometimes, even one on one.<BR>The way I found them the first time was to have my 6th(now 7th season)Ranger killed because I went to investigate.
