<h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
<p>Neriak is the center of the Dark Elven empire, and is a splendid, dark city 
  that lies carved out of the mountians next to the Nektulos Forest. No natural 
  light has ever seen their homeland, and the dark elves thrive and flourish in 
  their city. All manner of evil races, including the Trolls and Ogres, can be 
  found within. Most of these are restricted to the Foreign Quarter, where the 
  dark elves trade with the outside world. The deeper parts of the city house 
  many of the city's shops, guild halls, and homes.
<h3><font size=+2>S</font>urrounding <font size=+2>A</font>reas</h3>
<p>Neriak lies off of the Nektulos Forest, a barely alive forest that is continuously 
  in the dark from the smoke drifting down from the volcanic Lavastorm Mountains 
  to the north. To the south of the forest lies the Commonlands and the homes 
  of their enemies, the humans.
<h3><font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
  <font size=+2>N</font>eriak</h3>
<p>Neriak can be reached only by travelling through the Nektulos Forest to its 
  well-guarded entrance. To the north of the forest lies the broken Lavastorm 
  Mountains and the lair of the great dragon, Lord Nagafen, as well as the Temple 
  of Solusek Ro. To the south of the forest lies the Commonlands, and from them 
  the human cities of Freeport, Highhold Keep, and the lands beyond.
<h3><font size=+2>L</font>ocal <font size=+2>C</font>olor</h3>
<p><b>Places</b>
<p>Neriak is a twisted, but beautiful, city, carved out of the earth millenia 
  ago. Magic and excellent artisanship have lit up the city with glowing neon-colored 
  lights, and fountains and monuments to the god of the dark elves, Innoruuk, 
  fill the city. 
<p><b>People</b>
<p>The city of Neriak, for all of its beauty, is filled with danger, as befits 
  its occupants. Stepping into the wrong place in any part of the city can easily 
  get you killed, and this is especially true for the Trolls and Ogres, who, although 
  guests, are not welcome everywhere. This could be from some degree of superiority 
  on the dark elves part, and also because of the plot the dark elves are hatching, 
  lying barely hidden beneath the surface of the city.
