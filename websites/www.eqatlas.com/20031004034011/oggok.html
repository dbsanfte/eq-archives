      <p><i>The following description was also gathered from my &quot;friend&quot; 
        Jubjub the Shadow Knight. He had some unkind things to say about his neighbors, 
        the ogres, stating that he had some friends amongst them and had trained 
        with their master on occasion, but did not hold them dear to his heart 
        by any means. I believe that the ogre and troll alliance is something 
        in the fashion of &quot;the enemy of my enemy...&quot;</i></p>
      <p align="right"><i>--Muse</i></p>
      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      <p>Oggok is simple from the outside, and if you were to fly over the cove 
        you would only see a few small huts and one large building jutting from 
        the face of the side of it. However, most of the city lies underground, 
        as the ogres have carved out a place to live despite their limited space. 
        Most of the area is very confusing to individuals who have never been 
        there before, which I would think had been intended if it were not for 
        the general stupidity of ogres. Jubjub might say that a troll had designed 
        the place... 
      <h3><font size=+2>S</font>urrounding <font size=+2>A</font>reas</h3>
      <p>The Feerrott is a land that the ogres call home. Many of them live within 
        a short distance from their town, and live in relative safety through 
        their strength. Also, the creatures that inhabit the Feerrott are generally 
        weaker than in the neighboring Innothule Swamp, or at least are organized 
        enough to keep to themselves. Unlike the frogloks, the lizard men of the 
        Feerrott exist only in small camps, and could easily be decimated by an 
        organized group of ogres if they made too much of a nuisance of themselves. 
      <p>The nearby Rathe Mountains are a dangerous place, inhabited by the ghosts 
        of ancient towns that lay destroyed throughout it. Hill giants make their 
        homes in its peaks near Lake Rathe, and lizard men have also ventured 
        into them, as well as other, stranger creatures which I saw at a distance 
        but choose not to comment on in case I am incorrect. The Innothule Swamp 
        is also nearby and is the home of the trolls. Many ogres travel there 
        to smash frogloks to obtain their cloth-like skins for armor, since there 
        are not any bears nearby for tailors to practice their trade. 
      <h3><font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
        <font size=+2>O</font>ggok</h3>
      <p>Oggok opens into the Feerrott in an area that looks like a small ogre 
        town, with several small clusters of huts and shops. Many of the towns 
        artisans live outside of its walls within range of the guards for the 
        town, although they rarely need to call on them for aid. Travelling to 
        the northwest through the Rathe Mountains eventually leads to the Plains 
        of Karana and lands beyond. Travelling east through Innothule Swamp eventually 
        leads to the Desert of Ro and Freeport and the lands to the east. 
      <h3><font size=+2>L</font>ocal <font size=+2>C</font>olor</h3>
      <p><b>Places</b> 
      <p>The town is very complex, with a simple above-ground part and the more 
        complex, twisted underground component. The main warrior guild is not 
        a place to hang out if you're not an ogre, though, because they tend to 
        hate anyone but themselves. Unlike Grobb, which has no place to perform 
        any skills, Oggok has all the tools one might need for performing trade 
        skills. 
      <p><b>People</b> 
      <p>The ogres of Oggok are the brute force of the forces of evil. They are 
        not mentally complex enough to plan or coordinate much of what goes on 
        like the dark elves, and don't have the sinister appeal that trolls do, 
        but they are very effective at what they like to do best...smash.
