<h3>
<font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
The Northern Desert of Ro is a highly trafficked and popular area that
marks the southern edge of the human city of Freeport as well as the northern
edge of the vast Desert of Ro. It also represents a major waypoint for
the dark races that pass from Neriak to the swamps to the south, and many
of their kind can be found here.
<h3>
<font size=+2>D</font>angers</h3>
This zone generally provides some good, safe hunting, mostly in the northern
part of the desert, where adventurers can find non-hostile creatures that
don't group together to battle. The dangerous part of this zone comes about
because there are several types of higher-level roaming single creatures
that are very aggressive and dangerous. The most common are the madmen,
who are extremely aggressive but also easily distracted and slow runners.
The rarer ones are the various mummies, who are also slow but can cause
disease with their attacks. And, of course, there are the most dangerous
creatures, the sand giants, who generally stay to the southern edge of
the zone but travel about half way up in their walking.
<p>Of the dangers that are more predictable, though, the most dangerous
is the Dervish camps. These are generally camped out by adventurers hunting
for good experience and Dervish rings to sell elsewhere. Although the Dervishes
generally spawn at a regular rate, sometimes several of them spawn at once
and can be of quite varying levels, and can occasionally include a Thug,
which are very powerful in melee combat.
<h3>
<font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>
The Northern Desert of Ro is a very popular area for a number of reasons.
First of all, it is very much like a marketplace for higher level characters,
as many of the higher level characters in the Freeport area hunt somewhere
in the Desert of Ro and travel back and forth to Freeport through this
zone. If you are looking for an item or items, this is a good place to
start, as many merchants come here to sell their wares, or know of someone
else who does.
<p>The other bonus to this area is that there is a great deal of good hunting
here. Yes, there are a lot of people camping out the major sites where
monsters appear (the Dervish camps, the undead sites), but there is still
a good deal of hunting for groups levels 4-10 and solo levels 7-15.

The Northern Desert of Ro can be reached from the south by a vast border
with the Oasis of Marr. There is no narrow pass to go through, just walk
over the dunes.
<p>The northern edge of the desert has a wide border with East Freeport
and the newbie area there. Also, on the northwestern corner, tucked away
behind the large stone spire, lies the infamous "Tunnel" to the East Commonlands.
The route is long, but generally safe and is heavily travelled as people
who would rather bypass Freeport altogether travel through here.
