I STILL do not see the need for an INDIVIDUAL mini-game like this. I realize that this was not created in a way that would occupy development resources, but this game should have been a give away for players of Everquest and not something that should be conducted in game because it is too distracting from the "environment". I would have rather seen this given away to players as freeware, rather than an in game activity.<BR>There are too many things about this that do not fit in with the "vision" Verant is constantly preaching that I can't even comprehend it... <P>1. Verant wants to discourage soloing, and gives players an experience bonus for grouping, and then creates an individual based mini game for "downtime"... This could not only interfere with groups, but also sort of encourages/rewards soloing and then sitting recovering rather than efficient group killing....<P>I am sure that this will continue to happen (and HAS already): "I was playing gems, and I didn't see that your health had gone down so fast". Players have already begun dying, then complaining, petitioning the GMs, and getting upset because of deaths.. Doesn't anyone else see this blowing up in Verant's face and that it can only get worse... <P>In a balanced group there is rarely downtime that is significant, and I have been in plenty of groups where people meditate through pulls.... I just see this as an unnecessary addition, that will be more trouble than it is worth in the long run (at least from my perspective). The chat interface is designed to give you something to keep you occupied in "downtime" and that is to communicate with the players around you AS your character.<P>Absor has already responded that he personally doesn't want there to be a tag notifying people that someone is playing gems, and is also opposed to giving group leaders the ability to disable this (which was my suggestion). This has already happened where groups have died and lost experience due to "I wasn't paying attention to your health, I was playing gems" players, and this can be avoided by adding these. Characters want to assure that people they are grouped "covering their backs", and although people DO go afk, watch TV, vacuum etc. when playing, these are the same people who get groups killed currently.<P>I do not see the GEMS feature actually breeding harmony between players, and THE ANGRY FEW would take death at the hands of Tetris addicts reason for a direct confrontation. With the added stress of a corpse run this could breed bad blood between players (especially those who are stuggling compared to those who are say "well equipped", carefree, or fall into the bad player realm already)...<P>Seriously from a role playing standpoint I want the person meditating to be trying to stay in tune with the environment by paying attention to the chat (and focusing his energy from the environment) rather than playing Tetris (or reading a book, vacuuming, or whatever)... While meditating, there are plenty of things to do, including using emotes to make your character come to life. Another reason that it bothers me is that from a Role-play standpoint we will see zone-wide arguments about deaths by this, as well as spam about scores and COMPETITION (like EQ doesn't already have enough of that).... <P>Even if I were to disable shout (which is useful for knowing about trains and communicating to the entire zone) as well as /ooc I would still be subjected to gems discussions. People everywhere are talking about it, so even were I to remove these channels someone would still mention it. I also needed to remove myself from a so called RP guild because they were discussing gems.. Of course saying something about not wanting to hear about gems would result in more arguments, and even though I don't want to hear about it at all, I don't want to start arguments either.<P>It's not only about people doing this in group, my problem with it is that GOOD groups are hard enough to find (and soloers will love this game).... I simply don't want this to start impacting in &lt;more&gt; group deaths, not to mention the chattering about high scores that will fill zones as well as groups.<P>I just don't think giving this feature in game is something that was going to help immersiveness, and not only that but it will impact me... They want us to group, and this will hurt the group mechanic, This comment by DCM_Skidmark says it all:<BR>"Gems was made for those who solo or when your in the city selling items you got from Guk. or when your camping the AC need i say more. leave it to some players to complain. When verant tries to give us something to do to pass the time. During downtime. As always though there are people who are gonna sit in lower guk and play gems cause they are addicted. OPPS sorry i didnt heal the tank in time i am on wave 20. Disband and ignore." <P>2. Verant wants to enforce naming rules to preserve the "immersiveness", they then add a puzzle game to ruin it and then give players something to spam throughout chat &lt;high scores and competition&gt; and remove them from the environment as well.<P>GEMS is even worse of a detraction than bad names and reduces EQ to the level of a chat room, meaning that Verant has abandoned their "vision"... Not only will they need to hire more GMs when people start complaining about GEMs spam and deaths, but they will also be making competition and in some cases disputes between players worse....<P>I think that Verant has finally destroyed the EQ environment completely (with GEMS), even in the light of the naming policy enforcement that they were trying to use to retain their integrity of the "World"... The world of Norrath I envisioned was for "playing your role" (ie RP) and I personally didn't want any reminder of the outside world, and the names (and rampant twinking) were a major detraction from that.<P>Currently, the majority of players do not adhere to their roles (i.e. stay in character), don't name themselves to suit the fantasy environment, or play the game as Verant once intended (RPG anyone?). Now, they have a way to further remove them from the environment (whether it's as a distraction or as a high scoring competition). <P>Another comment to refute, this one by Leolo:<BR>"As for roleplaying, with the few hundred thousand people playing EQ your chances of complete roleplaying are slim already, besides that point, adding a game that you can play isn't against roleplaying at all. If your character is going to sit for 10 , do you actually think s/he would just sit there looking at the same thing...no, they would probably pass their time with some sort of game, be it cards, possibly a variant of gems, etc"<P>If the character has downtime, then there are ALREADY plenty of things that they can do to occupy themselves, most of which are beneficial to actually work on. Players can work on their trade skills during self imposed downtime, or conversate with each other, and I find that more conducive to role-playing than Gems ever will be… People who want to play a "personally suited" game during downtime would be better served by playing another game that did not rely on a multi-player dynamic. <P>This game was Verant's (temporary) solution to complaints about "downtime", that amazingly didn't require any of their resources, and rather than actually fix those problems they distract from it. Players make downtime themselves, mostly by soloing or camping, or sitting around trying to sell something... I personally see no reason why there should be a mini-game for "downtime" that is player created, especially one that is individual and not multi-player.<P>3. Verant wants to stop camping, and kill stealing as well as preserve community. Then Verant gives these same "downtime", camping something people a game to play to keep them VERY occupied while waiting for Uberitemguy_00 to spawn, followed by people stealing kills from them...<P>For those of you saying that GEMs is the perfect thing to alleviate "downtime" when waiting for things to spawn, well then what happens when someone comes in and steals the spawn?? <P>I already think that "sitting" a spawn is an incredible waste of time, that breeds arguments, removes exp from people who should be earning it and destroys the economy, and Verant (who has been opposed to this) is now encouraging it. For a group camping experience this is obviously different, but Verant adding to the competition and arguments is what I don't understand.<P><BR>The main reason that I disagree with Verant's inclusion of this is that I began playing EQ because it WAS a role-playing game, and it is hardly that anymore with all the "d00ds", power-gamers, twinks, ill-naming and immaturity.. Since Everquest became a mainstream product there is little or no role-playing left, and this IS NOT the way to encourage that. <P>Many times role-players have asked that Verant do something to keep the integrity of the role-play atmosphere, but they have been refused at every turn... (whether it be the simple enforcement of the naming policy or the inclusion of a "role-play server" where people can only have one character and role-playing is encouraged) Verant adding Gems to the game has finally admitted that they don't encourage role-playing, and that instead they cater to the other crowd of mainstream, chat room, hack and slash teenagers and not the age 20 to 30 something, Role-players who gave this game it's start.. <P>Maybe Verant just admitted "It's broke and we can't fix it" and decided that they didn't care anymore and they want it to end. They want everyone to leave even the ones the game was designed for, who might have actually stayed. I as a role-player would've probably stayed when the mass migration happened (ahem new games), but this was seriously not implemented with the intention of retaining the "immersiveness" or the role-playing environment of Everquest....<P>

dude... lighten up. according to absor, gems was created by a programmer who was home sick. i seriously doubt that it was placed in the game to solve the so called 'problem' of downtime, but i am quite certain that it was just for fun. <P>what's fun, you ask? well, its when people relax the veins straining out of their foreheads, and celebrate the advantages of something, instead of posting riduclously long essays on internet forums.<P>and as far as roleplaying and everquest... i know many EQers who roleplay in RL(incl me), and for the most part, they do not treat EQ as a roleplaying game, but as a computer game. the simple fact is that you are never going to get a fully immersive, roleplaying environment going while under the constrictions of a programmed game, because even if the game has been years in development, it will never have the adaptability and creativity of a GM's mind. as soon as roleplaying is codified and slapped on a computer, you lose the infinite possibilities that exist within the human mind.<P>and if you are such a hardcore roleplayer, how do you deal with the concept of zones? in a proper roleplaying game characters shouldn't be left in suspended animation for 30 seconds every time they go to a new area....<P><BR>lighten up.. enjoy eq for what it is, not whine about what it is not.

"according to absor, gems was created by a programmer who was home sick. i seriously doubt that it was placed in the game to solve the so called 'problem' of downtime, but i am quite certain that it was just for fun. "<P>There is no problem of downtime... Downtime is something player created by people who don't have enough imagination to role-play or the typing skills to pull it off.. When there is ANY amount of time that I am not kill, traveling or working on a skill, I am interacting with other players, giving emotes and PLAYING as my character... That is my version of fun... Not some stupid Tetris clone that encourages soloing, and does NOTHING to increase our interaction with each other....<P>". the simple fact is that you are never going to get a fully immersive, roleplaying environment going while under the constrictions of a programmed game, because even if the game has been years in development, it will never have the adaptability and creativity of a GM's mind. as soon as roleplaying is codified and slapped on a computer, you lose the infinite possibilities that exist within the human mind."<P>Just because the world is static, is no reason that you cannot use the infinite possibilities that exist within your own mind to make your character interact with the world... Slapping it on a computer in the way that Verant did was for roleplayers to have somewhere to inject their creativity, and even if the world sorta stays the same, it is up to YOU to go and make it more interesting...<P>"and if you are such a hardcore roleplayer, how do you deal with the concept of zones? in a proper roleplaying game characters shouldn't be left in suspended animation for 30 seconds every time they go to a new area...." <P>It only takes my computer about 15 seconds to zone, but either way that is nothing more than an annoynace of loading the next part of the world. I seriously see less problems role-playing with "zoning" then I ever could with Gems.. <P>In case you missed the point, I was stating that Verant is the one who always preaches their 'vision' and has done a complete about face with Gems, not only that but roleplaying was just made more difficult because of Gems<BR>

I am in FULL agreement with Taobob.  I have experienced the "Sorry I was playing GEMS" syndrom.  In my case it was the other main tank, the group was in combat and she was playing GEMS.  Then we were trained and being already in combat were low on health.  3 members of the group died and they would all have lived with only slightly faster kills which the tank should have been providing.<P>I played tetris when it was new, liked it, got over it and don't need it getting my character or my friends characters killed in what should be a roleplay game.<P>Let me carry your soapbox for you Taobob.<P>Jacoby Justantine<BR>Paladin of Mithaniel Marr<BR>Veterian of 45 Campaigns<BR>Guild Leader of the Protectors of Harmony<BR>Saryrn Server

It is very upsetting to die because your groupmate was watching TV.  But if it was a Sony television set, does that mean you could petition?<P>I think it's important to remember that EQ has to satisfy a lot of different types of people with very diverse interests.  Personally, I agree with whoever said that roleplaying or making friends is a much more productive use of downtime than playing gems.  But I respect the right of others to feel differently.<P>I don't think a lot of people have suddenly stopped roleplaying in order to play gems.  And if they weren't doing it before, do you think gems has anything to do with the fact that they're still not doing it?

Bah, just admit you love it!   <IMG SRC="http://www.eqatlas.com/ubb/smile.gif"><BR>I think it is a great idea, and it is not GEMS that will cause more deaths or less roleplay than anything else one can do while sitting and medding.  I spent almost all the past 38 lvls soloing and anyone soloing that much knows that you spend half your time sitting down doing nothing, reading a book or watching tv.  I don't think that now playing GEMS instead of reading my book is sooo hurtful to the game as you say...  What about those long hours of camping a particular npc?? If someone is negatively affecting a group because they play GEMS, it is not the fault of the game but that person's responsibility to the group...  So what if it can't please everyone, why bash Verant because they are doing something nice for the players by merely adding an option to the game.  If you are such a hardcore roleplayer, then just don't ever type /gems on your machine and leave it for other ppl like me...  <IMG SRC="http://www.eqatlas.com/ubb/smile.gif">

Nebuk,<P>Lets see some things you fail to realize...<P>Gems may seem perfect to you, but that is because you are a soloer... This game was not designed for soloers, and if you wish to play solo then why the hell did you get a Multi-player game??? <P>I don't want people playing gems for lots of reasons, especially because it just doesn't fit having an INDIVIDUAL based mini-game in a mutli-player cooperative environment (or for that matter Tetris in a fantasy atmosphere)... <P>"I don't think that now playing GEMS instead of reading my book is sooo hurtful to the game as you say... "<P>It is really, because there are already too many people who haven't learned group mechanics because of soloing, and also the people playing it are the ones who don't belong in this game in the first place (it's mutli-player for a reason)... <P>"What about those long hours of camping a particular npc?? "<P>Well in the ideal situation (which would eb to have a group) you should have something to do besides reading your book or playing gems, but even so maybe you shouldn't be sitting on your ass, but rather out somewhere challenging (lazy bastards camping is another problem of the game)....<BR>

Well Taobob, why are you trying to put me down because i am currently a soloer!?<BR>First of all, it IS a game, and it is not made for grouping only, yes it is a multi-user game, i think that after playing it for a full year i would know that, but it is also made for soloing fyi, even while soloing one can enjoy the benefits of it being multi-user, while traveling or exploring or the occasional grouping, or to suddenly decide to help out newbies for fun, one can still interact with other ppl eventhough they are not consistently grouping when hunting for xp...  So what if i hunt alone but still take advantage of the other benefits of EQ being a multi-user game?  you have a problem with that???  There is indeed a small portion of the game for casual players like i am atm, and we ARE allowed to play alone too you know, if not, why don't Verant just take the soloing ability of the Necro and druids out??  <BR>And you know what, I know the mechanics of grouping very well indeed so don't come bashing my grouping abilities because you have no idea who i am and how many characters i have in the game, i lvld a SK to 36 when the xp penalty was still there, and if you played one then you know soloing was not an viable option for a SK over lvl 20.  I started many other characters, but none made it past 20 cuz i did not like their classes, i liked my Sk too much and now my Necro, which just turned 39(yeay, new spells!).  I started a Necro simply because grouping had become too hard for my SK, i started working on several things in RL and could only play an hour or two at a time and by the time you find an appropriate group you usually have to look for a replacement already cuz you have to camp, plus xp gain was sooo slow, and many many groups would not even want an SK most of the time cuz of the xp penalty to the group which only made it worse to find a group, which is not good when you have only 2 hours to play...  I know the xp situation has improved recently though, and have started playing my SK again...  but now i like my necro more than my SK am afraid so he will lvl faster...  <IMG SRC="http://www.eqatlas.com/ubb/smile.gif"><BR>N e way, don't you come tell me about the benefits of grouping and soloing, i think i know them pretty well, i am not saying i know the game more than you, but i am not a newbie either.<BR>As for sitting on my lazy bastard ass for camping stuff, as you say, you could not be more wrong and your head is pretty far up your own ass for saying such a thing without knowing who i am in the game, you are making me think you are not that much of a big time EQ player cuz you would know that if you are out questing for one of your class's item, you will have to camp some mobs for quite a loooong time sometimes, i have quested most of my stuff, mostly cuz i believe in the fun of questing one's own class specific stuff, eventhough it is pretty long to do at times, like for my Harvester, Shadowbound gloves/boots and robe of Enshroudment, and now trying the AC, so you are saying i was just sitting on my lazy ass camping these mobs that i needed???  I would call questing for my own stuff exploring and adventure, don't you??  That is more questing than what most ppl do on an old server like the one i am on where ppl would rather buy the stuff rather than questing it.  What about when i wanted a runed circlet for myself and instead of buying one i went to Perma to camp the preacher to get one for myself, which took me 6 hours for one circlet plus 4 morning stars, that was also not appropriate with the rules of the game???  I was suppose to drag a group all the way to Perma for a 6 hour camp for my circlet when i could do it alone by the time i reached 30, or in the middle of OOT for the gobo headmaster, which took me 3 different days at 3 hours a day to get??  With a 20 min spawn time, if gems had been on at the time i would have played it instead of reading a book waiting for my quest pieces...  I was just being a lazy nonexplorator not following the rules because i wanted to camp for my own stuff, hey???  I think you have the rules wrong buddy, the game is for everyone, it is indeed made towards grouping but it is not for that only purpose at ALL times, because one also solos I don't thing that is against the rules.  When i do want a group i look for one or play my SK, don't blame Verant or GEMS for affecting your group because someone was playing gems, it is that person's own fault for not looking after their responsability and for playing gems when it was not appropriate.  It is people behind the characters and the machines you know.  <BR>I understand what you are saying that gems doesn't really have a fantasy role, but don't bash ppl because they like it, i think it is a great attempt done by Verant to give something to do ingame during downtime for ppl like me, when appropriately used.  With a population of 360,000 users, i am sure there are other casual players like me who solo when they are on for only an hour, and then group or explore when they can finally get an afternoon or a night to play...  You hate gems that much?  then don't play it.  If someone is negatively affecting the group cuz they are playing gems, then kick him out of the group!  One can do many other things to negatively affect a group, gems is now just one of these options...  Like the other one said, should you petition to get someone's TV taken away because they were watching a movie on a Sony TV and were not paying attention to their group and someone died?...<P>Nebuk<BR>39th season leading his dead minions<BR>May the Prince bless you with Death<BR>&lt;I play on Innoruuk server for anyone interested to give a tell or to meet&gt;

Nebuk<P>you said:<BR>"So what if i hunt alone but still take advantage of the other benefits of EQ being a multi-user game? you have a problem with that???"<P>The problem I have with that is that if less people were solo (30-40% of some servers are druids), then there would be more groups... Seriously, why on earth would you subject yourself to a multi-player environment and then make it into a solo game... Seems to me you should save the $10 a month...<P>"There is indeed a small portion of the game for casual players like i am atm, and we ARE allowed to play alone too you know, if not, why don't Verant just take the soloing ability of the Necro and druids out??"<P>I am a "casual" player, and the reason it's hard to find groups at mid-levels is because there are TOO MANY soloers... Verant can only discourage soloing, and give incentive for grouping (like group xp bonuses) but they can't stop anti-social people from playing (or being solo).. Yes maybe because you have less time, and you don't like looking for a group, that you solo but that is no reason for Verant to give MORE people a reason to do so... I also hate the idea of "soloing along together", which is what groups will become if you remove interacting with one another.. <BR> <BR>"N e way, don't you come tell me about the benefits of grouping and soloing, i think i know them pretty well, i am not saying i know the game more than you, but i am not a newbie either."<P>I never said anything of the kind about what type of player you are, and never said anything except to respond to your comments about "soloing"... I also didn't directly refer to you as a "lazy bastard" but rather grouped all of the "campers" in that way (if you took offense then it seems I must've struck a nerve).. <P>Either way (whether you're a camper or a soloer) I SEE NO REASON that Verant should give you a mini-game, especially when you should be interacting with other players... Downtime is something you create yourself (no matter whether soloing, camping or anything else you wish to make an excuse about) and there shouldn't be a Verant mini-game to help you with those (as well as ignore the other players and possibly shirk your group responsibilities)...<P>"I think you have the rules wrong buddy, the game is for everyone, it is indeed made towards grouping but it is not for that only purpose at ALL times, because one also solos I don't thing that is against the rules. "<P>I never said that it was against the rules, I was pointing out that the last thing Verant needs to do is encourage people to do that (because there are enough anti-social people)...<P>"One can do many other things to negatively affect a group, gems is now just one of these options..."<P>Either way you missed the point, and Verant encouraging it is the point I'm making... The fact that "Gems" doesn't fit their neat little vision is what I'm saying here, and maybe along with learning how to add paragraphs you should work on reading comprehension... <BR>

I've played Gems once since that patch, and I like it. It was something to do while waiting for a boat. I still haven't finished that game  <IMG SRC="http://www.eqatlas.com/ubb/smile.gif"> I also read somewhere that they may add some multiplayer minigames, but that may be rumor.<P>The problem isn't the game. Verant has to please hundreds of thousands of people, and so they try new things, and anything they do will offend someone. In this case it looks like it's you. If you don't want it played in the group your in, let them know, and if they won't follow that, then you can leave.<P>Branelil of Luclin

Taobob I think im right in saying that your point was that Verant is saying one thing and doing another. Two of your main contentions being that GEMS is only a help to those higher lvl characters who want to camp a spawn for that rare drop item, and that it caters to those soloers out there. But have you not seen what they have done on Odus and specifically the Warrens, they are testing a new way to hinder this. If you or your group as a whole are to high lvl for a particular creature you are not going to get any lore items or no drop items. Also that dungeon was created so that newbies could have an oppurtunity to learn more about group dynamics at an earlier lvl and hopefully get them to group in the later lvls. It seems to me that at least in some way Verant is supporting their claim that they want to make the game more group based and stop those higher lvls from camping spawns. Sure you may find GEMS offensive but i find it EXTREMELY offensive that EQ is now filled with a bunch of people who love to whine about the current changes Verant is making. Those guys are working their arshes off trying to make this game more enjoyable for everyone, because ultimately thats what its all about FUN pure and simple. Now you can say what ever you want about soloing and how those that do it are anti social but its simply not true my friend plays EQ and he just doesnt like to group he says "there are alot of really stupid people on EQ." He still interacts with others online just not in a group. Personally i like to group but dont harp on someone because they prefer to solo remember its all about one thing and thats fun. if someone has more fun soloing let them do it, if someone likes to play GEMS in their downtime let them do it. The game was made and is being changed with the interest of everyone in mind not only for you or anyone else who agrees with you.

Tao, why not get some real info on the impact of GEMS on everquest before wasting the time and energy ranting about it?  I'd rather have someone play gems than go afk...  <P>Nearly all of the time that I play, I forget that GEMS even exists.<P>

Wow it's sad to see someone complain that much about a freaking mini-game. I could understand if you were ranting about killstealers/farming/it taking too long to level/ect. but complaining about gems is the sorriest thing i've seen on a message board. I agree with Toxyn. The rabid llamas will come for you in your sleep.......

This rant was composed during the first few days of Gems, and you are not being forced to read anything... My feelings about Gems are still the same as they were back when Gems was first introduced, and those are that it doesn't belong in this game..

Floating spaceships don't belong in the game, halflings don't belong in the game, taobobs don't belong in the game.  All my opinions and all wrong because I didn't make the game.  (All wrong except the taobob line, don't be so judgemental).

If you don't like Gems, don't play.  If your group members make gems a priority above your group then you probably shouldn't group with them.  It's not for soloers.  I play it often in groups because I'm stuck on my ass looking at a book otherwise, or a random zone view.<P>People like you really tick me off.  Anytime VI puts something in the game that is JUST fun and doesn't make you 733+ u84r, people like you whine like children.

How do I use gems? It sounds like something that would make me want to keep playing the game more.<P>Supremacists like Taobob really get on my threpenny bits "You MUST not play the game like this, you MUST only play it the way I want to play it".  That attitude just bites.<P>We don't all have 25-30 hours a week to dedicate to playing a game. My usual log in is about one and a half to two hours, maybe twice a week.  If I play my cards right my wife will let me group for a few hours at the weekend, but who wants to group for an hour? And I feel guilty if I accept an invite knowing I will be logging soon.<P>Taobob, what you need is your own server where you and all the like minded 50+ roleplaying fanatics can hang out together and leave the rest of us to just enjoy the game the best we can.<P>I mean if roleplaying is so central to the game what's the point of a character race like Dark Elves? Who'd group with them apart from more Dark Elves?<P>Gems sounds like a decent way to pass the time while resting / medding - at least you're looking at the screen and likely to see group messages (messages you tend to miss if you've gone downstairs to the kitchen for a beer / cup of tea 8)).

I find it interesting how some people expect everyone to want to play the game as they do.  And if others enjoy playing it differently then the others are wrong.<P>Why do you give others so much power to bother that much taobob?  If you dont like how they play dont play with them - dont solo with them  <IMG SRC="http://www.eqatlas.com/ubb/wink.gif"> or disband them or leave the group yourself.<P>What I tend to do if I am grouped with someone who is not productive for the group is let them know how I feel and if they dont want to do anything about it, either I disband them or I leave - have done it many times.<P>Just because someone likes to play gems does not inherently make them a bad person.  I have played it before but I dont when Im group because I like to pay more attention to my group - thats a choice I made but it makes me no better than anyone else.<BR><P>------------------<BR><B><I>Thwak</I></B> Monk of the 41st Season<BR><B><I>Luve</I></B> Druid of the 40th Season<BR><B><I>Tawk</I></B> Enchanter of the 21st Season<P>Veeshan Server

To start off I would like to say that it is impossible to suggest that everyone on EQ roleplay or play the game the same way you do.  This game supports too wide of an age group to even suggest such a thing. Now before I get some idiot trying to reem me about the user policty of 18+, let me say that I have personally grouped with a father and son combo, where the son couldn't hardly type a sentence yet he had his own account because "Dad" is an EQ junky and said it was ok.  To these guys EQ time was quality time with each other and they enjoyed it.  For a moment put yourself in Dad's shoes and tell your 8 year old son "No you can't play with me on this game because you don't know how to roleplay!"  Screw that this game is meant to be entertaining, that means FUN, you know something to do to pass time until you have to get back to the real world of work and school or housework.  If you're getting all bent out of shape because the game isn't what you want it to be then in my opionion it's time to find yourself another game regardless of how long you've been here yadda yadda.  If you want to roleplay then by all means do so, when I personally meet someone that is trying to roleplay I attempt to humor them the best that I can, but I am one person on a server of 100's and can't expect everyone to do the same.  Last I would like to point out that this is just a game, granted we all hate dying and losing exp and whatever but it's part of the game that's why you never see a "Game Over" message on EQ because they know people are going to die. If I ever get to a point that I can't die in this game and laugh about it then it's time to click &lt;cancel&gt; on my subscribtion because I've become way too crotchety in my old age to be bothered with something like EQ and need to settle down with something a little less nerve wracking like say Checkers?  It's outrageous to think that everyone has the ability to sit down in front of their pc and completely zone out the things that are happening in real life, people are going to watch TV, they are going to take bathroom breaks, they are going to make runs to the fridge to grab stuff, and you are still going to walk through a zone and see a few players &lt;AFK&gt; while they change a dirty diaper or refill a Sippy Cup or take the dog out for a whizz so what's the deal with one more little interruption?  Whether I die from someone playing Gems or because the group cleric was attending to a R/L problem, I really don't care, get up, get your stuff and get back in the game.  Draw steel and slay the (/ooc brb baby cryin) beast! Heh heh there's yer roleplay.

I play gems, I admit it. I know its not roleplaying, or is it? When you hurt yourself so bad you're in the hospital in RL what do ya do? Me, I pick up a gameboy and play. In a world with no gameboy (Norrath) people probably play gems. I know this may sound silly but its possible to play a game like this, even a warrior without any mana to speak of could play this game, in a world of magik they may have the ability to move stones or even have someone else do move them. <BR>If you die cause they goofin off no biggie, so ya gotta play some more to gain what ya lost, its a GAME. They call it PLAYING! So you died cause a caster was low on mana and got distracted playing a game by himself. Don't get mad, sure its frustrating but people are people and they aren't in it just for you. <P>YOU ARE NOT THE CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE!!<P>I know this may be a new idea, but its true. Dont get mad cause someone goofed up and didn't save you. Hell they probably died soon after too. <P>1)So in recap- <BR>2)Gems is fun<BR>3)People play gems for fun<BR>4)If you die and they a caster they meddin, dont got enough to kill mob and die too.<BR>5)THE WORLD DOES NOT TRY TO KEEP YOU ALIVE AT ALL COSTS(I know it should but it don't  <IMG SRC="http://www.eqatlas.com/ubb/frown.gif"> )

Gems is a Tetris-like game that is available in EQ.  Bring up your chat bar and type in /gems, and it takes you to the game.  Very simple little thing to pass the time while your warrior who foolishly solos too much sits and heals.    <IMG SRC="http://www.eqatlas.com/ubb/wink.gif"><P>----------------------<P>Kanammer<BR>Paladin of the Thirteenth Cycle<BR>Zebuxoruk<p>[This message has been edited by Kanammer (edited 07-12-2001).]

Taobob, please do us all a favor, and go take a dump. I don't need to read a 70 page long essay on all the bad things about Gems, and how its gonna, like, affect people in the long run or something. It's meant to keep people busy during downtime. Not to start World War III over. Honestly, sometimes I think some people have nothing better to do than rant about completly insignificant things.
