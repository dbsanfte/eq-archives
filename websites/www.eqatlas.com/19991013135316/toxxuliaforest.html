<h3>
<font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
Toxxulia Forest is a dark, quiet forest that encompasses much of the island
continent of Odus. It is separated into two areas by a river running roughly
east to west through it, the northern half more habited and the southern
half controlled by the kobolds and the necromancers.
<h3>
<font size=+2>D</font>angers</h3>
This island is the newbie area for the Erudites, and much of the northern
half of the zone consists of creatures second level or less running around.
The southern half is a little more dangerous, with the most dangerous being
the fact that it's easy to get lost here and aggressive skeletons and kobolds
roam the zone. It is considered unwise to venture below the bridge unless
you are at least 4th level or higher.
<p>There are two NPC's that can make your life difficult at best when roaming
the area south of the bridge. The first is the necromancer, Talrigar Eklorin, and his
pet, who roam the entire area south of the bridge. This necromancer is
more of an annoyance when you are by yourself, because he will charm you
and then you simply have to stand around until the spell wears out. If
you are with a group, however, you will attack the other group members,
so this becomes more dangerous. He will especially come after you if you
attack the high-level skeletons that hang out in the necromancer city entrance.
There are also roaming skeletons that wander this area, which are aggressive.
<p>The other NPC that is a major pain is Rungupp. He is on my short list
for NPC's that I plan on travelling across several continents specifically
to kill again, and is one of the most unbalanced NPC's around. Basically,
my 11th level ranger hunted him down to try and take him out, and he /con'ed
green to me. My first attempt I had to run for my life, and luckily could
outrun him handily to Erudin. I learned two things from this, however,
and that's that Rungupp will cross the bridge, and also that the guards
of Erudin apparently like Rungupp and do not attack him. My second attempt
involved joining some friends to take him out at the gate, since they felt
that his ability to blind me continually (and never run out of mana) might
be hurting my chances. So our larger group of my ranger, a cleric, and
a wizard, all of whom /con'ed him as green tried to take him. Basically
what happened was we ran into a complete standoff, where none of us were
able to take him down (he heals as fast as he damages you), and then when
we were close he fled, apparently regenerating at a phenomenal rate, and
eventually just popped out of the zone (my theory is that he gated home
to Innothule). In other words, Rungupp is a major pain, and a group of
11th level characters couldn't take him.
<h3>
<font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>
This is generally a pretty quiet and safe zone. There are not so many creatures
in the newbie area that you can get killed easily by wandering monsters.
On the other side of the bridge, although there are dangers, it is generally
pretty safe. The other plus with working across the bridge is that the
bridge counts as a "zone" in the sense that monsters don't cross it (and
neither do your pets, for that matter). Therefore you can flee to the bridge
and no monster will cross (except for Rungupp, of course).
<p>The other benefit is the kobolds in the camps. They are generally pretty
safe to camp out and there are rarely anyone else by them. A mage with
a 4th level pet could take one on if they were careful, or a two person
group, and they provide good mid-range exp. The only thing is that you
have to watch for wandering skeletons that will attack you and make you
run for the bridge.

<font size=+2>T</font>oxxulia
<font size=+2>F</font>orest</h3>
At the northern edge of the zone lies the entrance to the city of Erudin,
home of the followers of Erud. Passing underneath the "patio" will take
you to the city beyond. Within lies the docks from which you can reach
the ferry to Erud's Crossing and Qeynos.
<p>Swimming west across the water, straight out from the dock on the west
coast, will take you to the shores of Kerra Island, which is the home of
the Kerrans. The channel is only guarded by the occasional pirhana.
<p>To the south lies another "patio" that will eventually lead to the Necromancer
city, although that is not in place at the present time.
