  <h1>Starting Cities in Norrath</h1>
  <p align="left">The following guide was put together to hopefully give you an 
    idea of which cities are good to start in, regardless of the consideration 
    of race and class and religion. I will admit that I haven't started in all 
    of these cities yet, and the ones I've never been in I will not even comment 
    on. It's also important to notice that a great deal of the negatives were 
    based on the beta and the development at that point. I would assume that these 
    will be corrected by release &lt;ahem&gt;.</p>
  <h2 align="center">Ak'Anon</h2>
  <p align="left">I haven't played here a great deal, but my accidental omission 
    of this page the first day allowed me to gather quite a bit of information 
    from emails about it... Thanks all!</p>
  <h3 align="left">Advantages</h3>
  <p align="left">It is possible (in fact suggested) that you reach 4th or 5th 
    level within the city itself. This also has one of the handiest tough critter 
    zones on all of Faydwer, roughly 8th-10th level critters walking all over 
    the place. Plus, minotaur caves and axes... Need I say more?</p>
  <h3 align="left">Disadvantages</h3>
  <p align="left">City is somewhat confusing and slow to get around. Newbie mines 
    are a maze and it isn't easy to run for help if caught and in trouble. I lost 
    my first character by swimming up between a walkway and a building and getting 
    wedged there, and being unable to escape. Don't do that. Have to leave your 
    zone entirely to fight higher than 5th level critters.</p>
  <p align="left"></p>
  <h3 align="left">Rating: 7</h3>
  <h2 align="center">Erudin</h2>
  <p align="left">My very first beta character was started in Erudin, and was 
    quite successful, going on to become an 8th level magician named Kithuriel 
    before I moved on to greener pastures...</p>
  <h3 align="left">Advantages</h3>
  <p align="left">The newbie fighting area in front of Erudin is well-protected 
    from the tougher zones by a river and a bridge, so you can't get lost. There 
    are also people selling goods outside of the city who sell food and other 
    items (although they may now be converted to artisan goods). This keeps you 
    from having to zone to buy necessary items.</p>
  <h3 align="left">Disadvantages</h3>
  <p align="left">If you want to travel outside the zone it is a 10 minute boat 
    ride to Qeynos, plus all the zoning in between. Get used to begging to be 
    bound. There is a lag in creatures to fight from 3rd to 4th level. The newbie 
    area critters aren't abundant enough to make it worthwhile, and across the 
    bridge there are just too many killer skeletons roaming around to make it 
    worth all the times you'll die. Not many people play here, it can get lonely...</p>
  <p align="left"></p>
  <h3 align="left">Rating: 7</h3>
  <h2 align="center">Felwithe</h2>
  <p align="left">The city of the High Elves...</p>
  <h3 align="left">Advantages</h3>
  <p align="left">Any city on the island of Faydwer has access to the other cities 
    and their zones, which means if it's too crowded here, go elsewhere. It also 
    isn't far to recover your body in any of the other zones. By roaming to the 
    other zones, you can easily find creatures your level to battle. There are 
    also plenty of other adventurers to join with. And it's possible to find the 
    pelts needed to make patchwork for most of the island.</p>
  <h3 align="left">Disadvantages</h3>
  <p align="left">The newbie area is extremely crowded, due to Kelethin being 
    nearby and these two races being very popular. During the beginning of Phase 
    Four, it was unplayable here due to this. Greater Faydark itself is very confusing, 
    especially after you wander off the paths. Getting lost in orc town is a problem. 
    Access to Antonica is limited by the eternal boat ride from Kaladim to Freeport.</p>
  <h3 align="left">Rating: 6</h3>
  <h2 align="center">Freeport</h2>
  <p align="left">I haven't played much in this city. I disliked it, but I've 
    received some feedback from some people who have played there a great deal 
    more than I, and I add it here. Thanks Kevin and Ron!!</p>
  <h3 align="left">Advantages</h3>
  <p align="left">Good newbie areas. Access to boat to Faydwer. Heading south 
    to the Desert of Ro leads you to an area well-populated with 1st-5th level 
    creatures. Easy access to food and drink, as well as the Commonlands nearby. 
    Lots of good creatures to group against. Many quests and merchants in the 
    area to keep it interesting. Also there are a good number of nearby zones 
    for higher level characters to adventure in, including the croc killing grounds 
    in the Oasis of Marr and Befallen, a tough dungeon for levels 7-27.</p>
  <h3 align="left">Disadvantages</h3>
  <p align="left">Occasional wandering madmen in Northern Ro are aggressive and 
    very tough, and guards won't save you from them.</p>
  <h3 align="left">Rating: 7</h3>
  <h2 align="center">Grobb</h2>
  <p align="left">The troll city attached to the swamps...</p>
  <h3 align="left">Advantages</h3>
  <p align="left">There is a great deal of newbie material in Innothule Swamp 
    and nearby Feerott. Of note, the frogloks are rich and often swathed in magical 
    cloth armor. I've never had richer characters than my troll.</p>
  <h3 align="left">Disadvantages</h3>
  <p align="left">You only have two zones to travel around in when starting out. 
    You can really get stir crazy after a while and want to move on. Although 
    there are zones nearby, the next 5th to 6th level zone is on the other side 
    of the Feerott, which is a very long walk if you get killed. For that reason, 
    many stay and kill frogloks for weeks, but that can get tiresome. No bear 
    pelts for patchwork.</p>
  <h3 align="left">Rating: 7</h3>
  <h2 align="center"><a href="halas.html">Halas</a></h2>
  <p align="left">My most fun beta character was a Shaman from Halas, who I acquired 
    after some bug turned my 1st level Warrior into a 4th level Shaman. I didn't 
    complain. </p>
  <h3 align="left">Advantages</h3>
  <p align="left">This has one of the two best newbie areas for sheer number of 
    critters and wealth attainable. Just kill everything in sight. Also has pelts 
    available to make patchwork for yourself and your smaller neighbors to the 
    south. Once you map out the zone, it's pretty easy to find your way around 
    in and small enough to manage.</p>
  <h3 align="left">Disadvantages</h3>
  <p align="left">You are *way* in the boondocks. If you don't like your barbarian 
    friends, you had better get used to running through Blackburrow in the pitch 
    black to retrieve your body. Doesn't sound like fun? Also, some of the &quot;low 
    level&quot; quests involve some really dangerous areas.</p>
  <h3 align="left">Rating: 8</h3>
  <h2 align="center">Kaladim</h2>
  <p align="left">The dwarven mine turned city...</p>
  <h3 align="left">Advantages</h3>
  <p align="left">Butcherblock Mountains have to be the best hunting grounds in 
    terms of having creatures available for every level imaginable. I didn't leave 
    there until 6th level, and then not because I had to. Easiest access to the 
    boat to Freeport.</p>
  <h3 align="left">Disadvantages</h3>
  <p align="left">City itself gets some taking used to walking around. Lots of 
    instances of some random huge monster walking by and swatting everyone (&quot;where 
    did that undead pawn come from?&quot;). Need to go elsewhere to get pelts.</p>
  <h3 align="left">Rating: 7</h3>
  <h2 align="center"><a href="kelethin.html">Kelethin</a></h2>
  <p align="left">Tree city (makes me more scared of heights).</p>
  <h3 align="left">Advantages</h3>
  <p align="left">Very easy access to the city (no zoning needed). Once you know 
    your way around, easy to get to anywhere. Many small creatures to kill, with 
    the orcs providing the occasional exp boost. Provides a great deal of goods 
    if you know where to look.</p>
  <h3 align="left">Disadvantages</h3>
  <p align="left">Tends to be a very busy area, along with Felwithe. Also, orcs 
    tend to be overwhelming and group so much that even my high-level characters 
    would occasionally die from their swarms. Makes my palms sweat cuz I'm scared 
    of heights.</p>
  <h3 align="left">Rating: 6</h3>
  <h2 align="center">Neriak</h2>
  <p align="left">The dark elven city below...</p>
  <h3 align="left">Advantages</h3>
  <p align="left">A world unto itself, you could adventure down here for weeks 
    on end. Creatures are tough, but you advance quickly because of it.</p>
  <h3 align="left">Disadvantages</h3>
  <p align="left">City itself is very large and confusing. There is the highest 
    dweeb:character ratio of anyplace here playing, and the /shout'ing and /ooc'ing 
    could make a ten year old weep in pain. Difficult to leave and find safe hunting 
    grounds, because ogre and troll lands so far away. I found a lot of kill-stealers 
    when I played.</p>
  <h3 align="left">Rating: 4</h3>
  <h2 align="center">Oggok</h2>
  <p align="left">The ogres smelly city...</p>
  <h3 align="left">Advantages</h3>
  <p align="left">Very small city that is easy to get around in. Lots of good 
    regions between here and by Grobb for newbies on up, and you can smash all 
    day long. Not too many random wandering evil monsters.</p>
  <h3 align="left">Disadvantages</h3>
  <p align="left">No bear pelts for patchwork. The best mid-level hunting around 
    is probably frogloks, and they are almost two long zones away. Easy to get 
    lost in this large zone. Most creatures are aggressive around here.</p>
  <h3 align="left">Rating: 6</h3>
  <h2 align="center"><a href="qeynos.html">Qeynos</a></h2>
  <p align="left">The other human port city... In the beta, this was probably 
    the best fleshed out city. It's also Muse's hometown.</p>
  <h3 align="left">Advantages</h3>
  <p align="left">Very well fleshed out city. Really gives you the feel of being 
    in a port town. Readily accessible to many different zones, including the 
    starting zone for rangers and druids and Blackburrow. You could adventure 
    for weeks and never leave the area. Easy access to a lot of other zones, really 
    feels like a melting pot with barbarians, Erudites, humans and half-elves 
    all around.</p>
  <h3 align="left">Disadvantages</h3>
  <p align="left">Newbie area can sometimes get very crowded, and the only 2nd 
    level critters (fire beetles and Klikniks) are groupers.</p>
  <h3 align="left">Rating: 9</h3>
  <h2 align="center">Rivervale</h2>
  <p align="left">This is the only city I have never once set foot in. Peter e-mailed 
    me to give me his take on it, thank you Peter!!</p>
  <h3 align="left">Advantages</h3>
  <p align="left"> Great newbie ground with lots of fire-beatles and spiderlings 
    everywhere. After that is easy cross a big wall to the harder creatures. Lots 
    of pelts from wolves here. Also good fishing with a pond inside the town.</p>
  <h3 align="left">Disadvantages</h3>
  <p align="left">Isolated except from Freeport. Confusing city with a lot of 
    things looking the same. </p>
