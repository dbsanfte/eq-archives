<h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>

<p>Najena is the ancient home of a twisted dark elf necromancer named Najena, 
  who carved out this hole in the hidden areas of the Lavastorm Mountains in which 
  to carry out her experiments, as well as those of her allies. The undead walk 
  the halls as if it is home.
<h3><font size=+2>B</font>asic Zone Information</h3>

<p>Najena is a place filled with undead of various types. The rooms are packed 
  with them, with typically four skeletons of various types lying on the floor 
  of any given room. Added to this are aggressive earth elementals and ogre guards, 
  all of whom will attack on sight. For adventurers in the lower level ranges 
  listed above (below 17th level or so), travelling in a group should be the rule, 
  as simply walking in a room can result in four creatures jumping you at once. 
  Once you've hit 17th, only the occasional Darkbone Skeleton will attack. For 
  lower level adventurers, hunting in the front rooms and attacking the creatures 
  that are there should provide enough excitement.
<h3><font size=+2>A</font>dvanced Zone Information</h3>

<p>For higher level adventurers or groups, the zone is much more interesting than 
  trying to fight off swarms of skeletons. There are several areas of interest. 
  First of all, there is a whole key system to the lair of Najena. Various creatures 
  and NPC's carry the keys to access other areas within the lair. I will use the 
  keys to describe how to move through the zone. The ogre guards carry a key ring, 
  which gives you the most basic access to the area where Bonecracker lives. Bonecracker 
  is an approximately level 25-29 level undead froglok who lives in a room with 
  two lovely dark elf necromancers. He also spawns the Barbed Leather Whip occasionally, 
  and he himself spawns every 20 minutes. He gives you the dull key.
<p>The dull key is then used to access Rathyl's area, where you can fight Rathyl. 
  Killing him will give you access to the key for Drelzna's room. He then reincarnates 
  (as Rathyl reincarnate) and sometimes has the Hollowed Bone Bracers as loot. 
  Then you can access Drelzna's room, who is slightly higher level, and used to 
  spawn the Journeyman Boots (but not more).. Getting the key from Drelzna will 
  allow you to access the room with Najena herself, who is about 35th level or 
  so and has several high level protectors. She spawns the Flowing Black Robe 
  and the Black Tome with Silver Runes.
<p>There is also a prison area, which the intrepid explorer can find himself trapped 
  in by falling through one of two pit traps located in the upper level. There 
  appears to be some quest that can be done from here, but I wasn't able to initiate 
  it, by talking to a damsel in distress. There was also an injured halfling, 
  who was unapproachable.
<h3><font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
  <font size=+2>N</font>ajena</h3>

<p>The entrance to Najena lies in the southeastern corner of the Lavastorm Mountains. 
  It is impossible to miss, as it consists of a huge set of double doors, with 
  one blown off its hinges from some unknown force within.
