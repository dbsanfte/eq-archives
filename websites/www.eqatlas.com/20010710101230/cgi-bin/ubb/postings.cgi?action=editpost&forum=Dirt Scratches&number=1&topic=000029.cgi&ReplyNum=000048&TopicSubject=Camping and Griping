<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">&gt;The other problem, though, and in my
&gt;opinion the biggest one, is the fact that
&gt;the game, despite having a "preferred
&gt;method" of doing the dungeon, is in
&gt;fact designed for people to camp. Spawns 
&gt;and drops are static, so people looking 
&gt;for a particular item go to that room 
&gt;and set up shop.

AHA!!! You hit on something I have been thinking about.  :D

A. If rewards (especially dropped loot) are normally located in static and predictable places, especially predictable spawns, then this logically is a stimulus for camping. 

B. If "something better than camping" is desired (either by players or by Verant), then there has to be an enticement to give rewards for those who adventure and move about beyond static camps (or even static dungeons). 

C. Why not put MORE dynamic (randomly timed, randomly moving, NON-static located, you-can-never guess-where-they-will-be) spawns and the treasures associated with them? In fact, this already happens to a small degree.... and it's called "The GM Events". Also a few wandering/roaming rewarding (in XP and loot) mobs already exist in some zones, Giants are one example. 

D. A successful execution of "C" will give more incetives for travellers/roamers. It will award random rewards for players who *actually* move about and explore and keep walking around, rather than sitting a camp all night long in the same exact place, knowing the same monsters they can kill, knowing exactly what mobs will pop that they will kill. 

Again, why not put in place some *rewarding* mobs that are dynamic and unpredictable, rather than static? For that matter, why not put *NAMED* spawns that can randomly appear in several zones (not simultaneously of course), instead of being based in just one zone. Why not? 

E. Yes I am aware of wandering monsters. I am ignoring that factor, because most wandering monsters (like wandering skeletons that roam entire zones) are not considered "rewarding" and are nothing more than distractions that get in your path. There are rare exceptions, like Giants that provide good XP and drop decent loot for characters high enough to slay them. 

How about the existence of medium-level wandering spawns? Except that they arent so incredibly red (like Giants are to most players) that they butcher every lesser creature in their path? How about adding THOSE for mid-level characters to bump into? 

Or how about one for the newbies/lowlies?

Newbies spend tons of time killing bats and skeletons and such. Why not put a random spawn of a "special skeleton" mob, maybe a slightly tougher skeleton leader. The operational word here is "slightly higher level". It should be tough enough to give the average newbie a scare, but not so impossible that it goes around killing ALL the newbies. 

The newbie/lowlie that is tough enough to survive an encounter should be rewarded decent XP and maybe some magic item drop that will make them smile for a few days. 

And why not? When was the last time anyone saw an untwinked lowlie capable of killing ANY mob that dropped magic items? In my experience, never. 

IMHO, none of my suggestions are outrageous, impossible or unfeasable to implement. All of them provide additional rewarding challenges and encounters.... without having to sit in a camp all night long. 

Nor did I suggest anything that would really "throw off the game balance" IMHO. =) 

And yet something tells me it will never be listened to by Verant.  :( 

*sigh*
