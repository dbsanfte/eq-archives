      <p>Kedge Keep is the ancient fortress of the Kedge, an aquatic race of beings 
        whose civilization perished centuries ago. A few of the kedge can be found 
        within, but mostly the other inhabitants of the Keep stay inside. The 
        Temple to the god Prexus is also hidden within the aquatic depths of the 
        Keep.

      <p>&lt;<i>Note, as complete as I try to be, one of my contemporaries has 
        written an extensive guide on this topic, far more complete than what 
        I will include, and I owe much to him for making my research on this topic 
        much less painful and much quicker. Anyone seriously planning on hunting 
        within should at least read it once. It is displayed at </i><a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/Phreekittys_Ultimate_Guide_to_Kedge_Keep.htm">Phreekitty's 
        Ultimate Guide to Kedge Keep</a><i>... --Muse</i>&gt;
      <p>This dungeon is a very unique place in which to adventure. Unlike all 
        the other places in all the lands, the entire dungeon is underwater. This 
        alone requires that any group adventuring within have a fair amount of 
        planning before travelling within, and so it is also one of the least 
        inhabited dungeon in the entire game. You will never hear someone yell 
        &quot;camp check!&quot; in all your time here, that much I can guarantee.
      <p>The uniqueness of this zone makes it dangerous for a few reasons that 
        someone adventuring within needs to take into account when hunting there, 
        regardless of what you hunt. First of all the zone is entirely underwater. 
        That means that anyone going inside has to have some way of breathing 
        underwater, either through an item, a spell, or a bard song. Make sure 
        to keep ahead of this if you are using a spell to breathe with, since 
        it can run out like any other and death by drowning is fast. This can 
        also make corpse recovery difficult, since all of the above require an 
        item to take advantage of.
      <p>The second problem is that the dungeon is one of the few that extends 
        up and down as much as it extends in the traditional directions. This 
        can be dangerous if you use any area-of-effect type of spell or song, 
        because all of the creatures above and below you in the dungeon will feel 
        this as well. Be aware if and what rooms and monsters are above and below 
        you when you cast a spell. For instance, say you are pulling the Second 
        Floor into the east room, and someone (I won't say who) casts an AoE rain 
        spell, for instance. This will affect the monsters you are fighting, but 
        will also affect the monsters below you, in this case, area #3 on the 
        map. They will then actively engage in the next problem...
      <p>Pathing and popping are the next two largest problems. Pathing in the 
        Keep is a constant pain, since creatures move along very non-intuitive 
        lines when they come to you after a pull. It seems intuitive that a fish 
        across a room from you, when shot with an arrow, would turn towards you 
        and move in, following you as you go. Unfortunately, this isn't always 
        the case. If you pull with the creature right on you, it will follow you 
        pretty well. If you don't, however, the fish will, if you're lucky, follow 
        a circuitous route around the perimeter of the room to meet you. If you 
        are unlucky, it will turn and swim out of the room or just get stuck somewhere. 
        At this point it will do the next fun trick, and will pop to where you 
        are. The puller swims back, no fish in sight, and POP! the fish is directly 
        in the middle of the group, hopefully without too many additional friends 
        it found along the way. In the above example for the vertical dungeon, 
        the popping fish would be Cauldronbubble, not a fish you want dropping 
        in unannounced. Also, along these lines, using spells that cause fear 
        or slow a creature on the pull, or losing track of a pet, will likely 
        cause the creature to get lost, only to pop back with many enemies. If 
        this happens, it's better to evac and figure things out later...
      <p>Now for specific dangers. There is one fish that everyone should be aware 
        of, and that is the Shimmering Sailfin. This fish, when killed, can occasionally 
        explode causing 400 points of AoE damage. Also, killing off the sailfins 
        that can be frequently seen floating around will cause the more dangerous 
        and aggressive piranhas to start spawning, which can cause problems if 
        you're in for a long camp.
      <p>Two of the rarer spawns bear mention. The first that most groups will 
        encounter is Estrella of Gloomwater. She is quite possibly harder to take 
        down that Phinigel himself, and even if this isn't true, the possibility 
        makes the point that she is no pushover. She is highly aggressive with 
        a large aggro radius, can see through invisibility, has several guardians 
        (all of whom can see through invis as well), and is a formidable caster. 
        She can dispel your buffs (&quot;Enduring Breath, anyone? Please!?!&quot;), 
        blind you, and if that's not enough, summon you to her to finish the job.
      <p>The other rare spawn is Phinigel Autropos himself. His room is designed 
        in a unique way, with the entry hall at the top of a large barrel-shaped 
        room. Just below the entrance is a narrowing with a star-shaped opening 
        that leads downward to where Phinigel is. Pulling this area is extremely 
        difficult, because he has many powerful guardians, which will aggro you 
        easily and can take down even a very powerful party if you get more than 
        one or two that you can't control. Pulling Phinigel in any way other than 
        by himself is a death wish. He has all the abilities of Estrella, and 
        is even more powerful...
      <h3><font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>
      <p>As I mentioned above, this zone has the distinction of having the least 
        occupants at any given time of any zone in the game. That, to me, means 
        that the hunting here is fine. There will be no trains that you don't 
        create. There will be no idiots begging for some change. There are no 
        lines for any of the creatures, and you can hunt whenever you want. You 
        can actually feel like explorers, and that you're seeing things that very 
        few people in the game have ever seen. That's probably the single biggest 
        benefit of the zone.
      <p>There is also great treasure to be gained by hunting here, including 
        many powerful items that you've likely never even heard of, much less 
        heard auctioned off at the bazaar. Many of the monsters drop incredible 
        loot in the form of gems. Rare spawns are clustered so that taking on 
        an area easily leads to the ability to gather several unique items per 
        trip.
      <h3><font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
        <font size=+2>K</font>edge <font size=+2>K</font>eep</h3>
      <p>There is one way to get to Kedge Keep, and that is by swimming down through 
        the waters at the southern tip of the lake in Dagnor's Cauldron to the 
        broken entrance hidden in the depths. If you are an apt swimmer, you might 
        be able to do it while holding your breath, although what you plan on 
        doing inside Kedge Keep when you are unable to hold it any longer is anyone's 
        guess.
