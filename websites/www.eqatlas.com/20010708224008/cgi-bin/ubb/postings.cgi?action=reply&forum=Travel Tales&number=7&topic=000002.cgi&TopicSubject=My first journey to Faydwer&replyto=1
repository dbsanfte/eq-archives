I struck up conversation with a Barbarian who I now know must have been a Shaman for he cast spells on me that endowed me with great strength and fast feet.

Well, that goodly Barbarian kept talking to me with that innate telepathy that everyone in Norrath shares regardless of race. When he coached me back onto the boat and I arrived safely in Freeport the good man did surprise me further with a charitable contribution of some very good chain armor and a bastard sword. To Garadorn, thank you sir!

Having never seen such large boats before, we were both in awe at --and a bit shaken by -- the size of the ship that arrived. However, we were determined to make the trip.<P>We boarded the ship, and settled in for what we had heard was a long and boring trip. We, however, were a bit more excited than the average traveler, having never seen the fabled Ocean of Tears before. Shortly thereafter, the boat began to move, and we were off! We quickly became accustomed to the rhythmic swaying of the boat, and ran to and fro, trying to absorb as much of the surrounding scenery as we could. We even spent a short while on the lower decks, but did not spend long there, for fear that we would miss the short stay at the dock in Faydwer.<P>To our surprise, we reached the dock in what seemed to be minutes. Happy to have reached dry land once again, we stepped onto the dock of what we thought to be Faydwer. No one else seemed to get off here, but we didn't notice. We were too awestruck by the new journies that awaited us! We walked around and saw the Inn, and sat down to take a rest. Although it was not physically draining, the trip had been emotionally and mentally exhausting, and we were looking forward to taking a short rest now that we were back on stable ground.<P>We never saw what hit us. My wife and I were slaughtered with no chance to defend ourselves. To this day, we have no idea what happened.<P>We made our way back [OOC: how do you roleplay the fact that you come back from the dead and can loot your own corpse?], and retrieved our equipment from our broken and battered bodies. Needless to say, we have not returned to this day, despite (or perhaps because of) the fact that we are much more experienced now. It was quite sometime before we learned that the 'great continent of Faydwer' we docked at was actually the Island of the Sisters of Erollisi. We have since been to the real Faydwer and back many times. The moral of the story is: if there are twenty people on a boat, and the boat docks, yet no one gets off... don't be the only ones getting off, unless you know for certain where you are.  <IMG SRC="http://www.eqatlas.com/ubb/smile.gif"> [OOC, and a plug for this web site: or grab a map from EQ Atlas!]<P>I hope this has amused and entertained, and perhaps enlightened those who may have not yet made the trip to Faydwer, and may have stepped off on the wrong island.<P>Until next time,<P>Drayman Journeymaker</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Rylius</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">LOL, I am sure you have received a much warmer reception in homeland since then!<P>I remember my first trip to Anotonica.
