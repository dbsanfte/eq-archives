</FONT><HR><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">It was a long winter in Halas when I suddenly decided I was tired of snow, and longed to see if those rumors of a hot dry dessert far to the east were true.  I left my hut and first set out toward Qeynos, a trip I was allready familiar with.<P>Traveling through the Everfrost peaks to that foul home of the Blackburrow Gnolls was an easy trip.  I'll never understand how all the little people get lost near my homeland, maybe its their smaller brains.  After entering Blackburrow, I crossed the upper level to the tunnel to Qeynos Hills.  There were quite a number of younger barbarians, half elves and humans trying to keep a handle on the gnolls as I passed through.  Once in Qeynos Hills I marhced south to Qeynos where I decided to pick up a mail package to High Keep.  After leaving Qeynos I marched north to the crossroads where I finnally turned east.<P>I marched through the pass in Western Karanas and found a nice brother barbarian who was willing to infuse my spirit with that of a wolf.  I was then able to run like the wind across the endless plains of Karanas.  The rain was fierce but I kept on the path.  After while I scouted a couple of bandits on the road and decided I'd skirt around them.  After regaining the road past the bandits I was off and running again.  I saw some giant spider similar to the wooly spiders back home.  There were also some bears around, but I think they saw my bear skin helm and were frightened off.  I eventually made it to North Karanas where I stay away from the flying things and made it to the gypsy camp.  I did a little shopping, but nothing caught my eye.  I continued back on the road to Eastern Karanas finnally comming to a giant wooden bridge.  <P>After crossing the bridge the rain finnally started letting up.  I continued following the path except to get around a few lions.  I some some crag spiders in the distance and thought it best I leave them alone.  Eventually I made it to a path that began to climp the mountains.  I knew I was nearing the halfway point of my trip.  The path climbed, and climbed passing long forgotten guard towers.  It finnally leveled out and narrowed into a small pass where I finnally entered High Pass Hold.<P>Just inside I stopped and pulled out my trusty map case.  I had purchased a few maps from a trusting soul named Muse.  As I scanned the map, I noticed this area was like a rabbits warren.  I also noticed some warning signs about gnolls ahead.  So with map on hand, and the spirt of the wolf still infusing me, I boldly ran ahead to Highpass Keep.  I passed a gnoll or two and they tried to hit me, but missed.  I heard their footsteps behind me, but I quickly outpaced them, I turned several corners and finnally came to a stone wall, as I sprinted along the wall to the gate, the guards came out and stopped those gnolls following me, and I slipped quietly into the keep.  I delivered the mail package to the lovely bard inside.  I felt the wolf spirt leaving me but a passing druid again infused my spirt.  I knew I should be off again, so I left the keep with Muse's map in hand.  I knew I'd have to run a gauntlet of Orcs before I could escape into Kithicur Forrest.  As I neared the place where Muse's map indicated an orc infestation, I heard the sounds of battle.  There were several hero's trying to keep the infestation from growing.  I was able to sneak by unscathed, and made it into the pass that led to Kithicur Forrest.<P>I had heard many tales of this green land, the most frequent was just the warning to stay away at night.  Luckily the sun still had an hour or two left and I quickly followed the small path through the trees.  The path twisted and turned but eventually led to a pass I know would take me to the Western Commonlands.  The sun began to set as I ventured forth through the pass.<P>As I came out onto the plain of the Western Commonlands, I decided to cut straight across the plain as the road here wandered well south before continueing east.  As I neared a lake the was catching the last sparkles of the sun, I noticed a skeleton standing near by.  I didn't pay it a second though for I also saw the hut of my cousin who loved fishing this lake.  In my haste to get to the hut, I didn't see the skeleton look my way.  As I neared the hut, I felt the pain of steel across my back.  Turning I faced a skeleton I knew from my cousins description to be the Dragoon Zytl.  Though I fought hard, and even tried to go berserk, I quickly fell to the evil beast.  The Gods, deciding my work wasn't done, allowed my return to the mortal realm.  But the Gods decided to return me to Halas while my corpse in the Western Commonlands had all of my gear.  Thus began another long more dangerous journey.<P>-Wrentia<P><P>------------------<BR>Wrentia Starfyre<BR>Barbarian Warrior<BR>The Rathe</FONT>

</FONT><HR><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">It was so long and hard to attain the mighty fourth level, and I had grown bored of the all too familiar trees of gfay, so I set sail from nearby Kaladim port for the great continent of antonica. I am a ranger and not comfortable too long in civilization, so when a like level druid asked if i felt like running out to the western lands, i readily agreed. We ran long and hard, traversing the eastern commons so swiftly i thought, heck, i can go anywhere, the world is my oyster. Upon arriving in the west i quickly realized two things. First, while we are both defenders of natures furry friends, the lions of wc like ranger chow, and readily sought to devour this bag of kibble. The second, and most surprising, is that lions can magicly pass through closed inn doors as if they weren't even there! The greedy innkeepers did not lift a finger to aid me, as I ran in circles screaming for help, instead they kept offering to sell me stuff! When I awoke reborn from death's not-so-eternal embrace I realized to my dismay that in my eagerness to explore new lands I had forgotten to bind at Freeport! The journey across the sea would be far too long for me to undertake, for on another world far, far away the sun was rising and a thing called work beckoned. And now, a word of warning to all newbies: the hard copy manuel is incorrect on a very important point! I went to nap and to labor confident that my corpse would remain fresh and hard-earned possessions could be recovered upon my return to Norrath for a full Terran sun-cycle. But such is not the case! Would that I had consulted the electronic gods, for they would later inform me that my return journey to WC, filled with peril, and only survivable with the help of a friendly and powerful barbarian, would be for naught, as my stuff had long since vanished! And so I say to you, all young adventurers, reign in your wanderlust, get that bind right away, and consult the electric gods for advice! Let my loss be your gain. While experience is undoubtably the best teacher, she is also the most harsh!</FONT>
