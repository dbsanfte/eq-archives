<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">First off let me state that I am  newbie.  I have no char above lvl 22, 5-6 in the mid-upper teens.  Reason for this was I wanted to check out each class before I decided to devote my major time to one char.  That said I offer the following:

I watched a person sit at the camp right outside surefall glade(can't remember their names off hand).  This person sat there from level 16-17 until like 25-26 or so.  10 or more lvels worth of killing the same TWO mobs.  Now once this same person goes to another area at his current level of 29-30 some would expect him to have an idea what he is doing.  I know I would.  BUT how can this person know ANYTHING of fighting in a group IN a dungeon?  They can't possibly know anything of the way to fight like that.  They know how to solo and dot and run around in circles til it is dead.  Not much room for running around in the dungeons really.  My exp has been gotten by doin the newbie area, goin off to blackborrow, where I might add I learned to fight in a dungeon within a group, then on to NRO and oasis and finally into high hold pass on the orcs and gnolls.  I walked into high hold pass the other night and had 4 players ask if I wanted to join their group simply because I sortta knew what I was doin and would rather die making sure they are safely through the zoneing from a bad spawn then running for my own life and not caring if they lived or died.  Camping is a NESSARY evil in this game. VI can NOT make stuff drop every single time a monster spawns.  The balance of the game would be so lopsided that within a VERY short period everyone would be so powerful they would begin to hate the game simply because there is no more challenge.  Sure add more areas that have bigger and stronger monsters but you have to add more bigger and badder eq too, which by the way is dropping every spawn and thus the increase of player power is so rapid that well you get the idea.  

I do like the idea that once you have gotten an item that you can no longer go after it again.  Problem with that idea is they'd just get it for their friends or guild.  Personally I feel FARMING is what should be stopped.  Many spots are camped by farmers nothing more.  These are the ones who are ruining it for others.  Someone mentioned the 12 tomes in a row,  WTF is that for other then to 1. sell them, 2 give to friends/guildmates.  If the farming can be stopped I think alot less complaints would be forth coming on camping.  

Just some tidbits from a newbie who only has 2 months on the game.
