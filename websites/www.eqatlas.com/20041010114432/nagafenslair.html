      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      <p>Nagafen's Lair is a large set of caverns that lie deep in the Lavastorm 
        Mountains. Buried deep inside these caves is the lair of the Fire Giants, 
        who are the personal servants of the mighty dragon, Lord Nagafen. The 
        caverns leading to the dragon are infested with all manner of bats and 
        insects, as well as kobolds that have taken up residence in the entrance 
        to them.
      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>angers </h3>
      <p>This dungeon is generally regarded as one of the two toughest dungeons 
        in all of Antonica. There are many specific dangers that I will describe 
        below, however there are some general dangers as well. First is that everything 
        in this zone sees through invisibility, which means that corpse retrieval 
        and quickly moving through the dungeon are not really possible. You will 
        need to fight your way through everything you meet in order to move further 
        in the dungeon.
      <p>The second general danger has to do with the physical layout of the dungeon. 
        The tunnels themselves are winding and confusing, which makes getting 
        lost or getting trapped in a place you don't want to be, as well as a 
        quick getaway, very dangerous. There are zones to Solusek's Eye nearby 
        when you are hunting kobolds, but the path to them is usually very twisty. 
        There also exists within the zone a great deal of lava. People who fall 
        into the lava here will take quite a bit of damage, and although there 
        is usually a nearby place to exit the lava, you have to live until you 
        reach it. Many longtime hunters have entire suits of protection from fire 
        jewelry that they don when hunting here.
      <p>Now for specific dangers. The kobolds are probably the easiest to fight 
        in the dungeon, but that's not saying much. They can hit pretty hard and 
        take a lot of damage, and there are a lot of them in the outer areas, 
        so it's recommended to have a group when taking them on.
      <p>The &quot;bats and bugs,&quot; as they're called, are much more dangerous. 
        The bats themselves aren't too very tough, but they are nearly impossible 
        to solo because of their powerful stun attack, which takes you out of 
        commission for quite a while. The bugs are more dangerous, as many of 
        them have some evil poison- and disease-based DoTs that can wear you out 
        fast. They also tend to travel in packs and aggro easily.
      <p>Deeper still lies the Imp Guardians surrounding the Efreeti. This area 
        is very dangerous to hunt in due to the pathing of the creatures, and 
        has a high learning curve for how to do it safely. There is also basically 
        no way to safely flee the area if you run into trouble (other than evac'ing). 
        This is not an easy place to try and gain experience.
      <p>Further yet lies the Fire Giants in their temple. The strategy for clearing 
        out the Fire Giants is long and detailed, and requires a highly skilled 
        team of high level players to take on. None of these creatures can be 
        mesmerized at all or charmed except by very high level enchanters, and 
        they will resist all spells if the spellcaster is out of melee range. 
        Knowing the layout of the area is also important, as you will likely aggro 
        other Fire Giants through the walls of the place. Using someone who can 
        feign pull is essential in this area, and it shouldn't even be attempted 
        without it. 
      <p>The deepest being in this zone is the mighty Lord Nagafen himself. The 
        dragon lies hidden in the deepest part of the dungeon, and is protected 
        by all of the creatures listed above. Taking on the dragon requires the 
        coordinated efforts of several (the least I've heard of is 4) full groups 
        of characters in order to take out, and even then is not something that 
        it done with ease. Having that full suit of fire protection jewelry is 
        only essential here if you want to live...
      <h3><font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>
      <p>Having said all of the above, you might be wondering why people would 
        fight here at all. With all of the dangers in this zone, however, come 
        a great deal of both experience and items that are all highly sought after. 
        Before the discovery of the lost continent of Kunark, it was actually 
        difficult to find anything to kill in this zone because it was so crowded. 
        It is now more open for hunters, and you can likely find great experience 
        even during peak times.
      <p>There are also several areas within the dungeon where it is relatively 
        safe to hunt creatures without too much danger. Most of these lie near 
        the zones into Solusek's Eye, where it is possibly to pull creatures and, 
        if you are overwhelmed, zone away from them. Mountains of experience can 
        be earned here in a relatively short period of time by a savvy group.
      <h3><font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
        <font size=+2>N</font>agafen's <font size=+2>L</font>air</h3>
      <p>There are multiple entrances into Nagafen's Lair. The main one that people 
        take is from the Lavastorm Mountains. Within the mountains, travel to 
        the large lava pit at the north end, known as Solusek's Eye (not to be 
        confused with the zone Solusek's Eye, which everyone calls Sol A). There 
        are two paths to caves on the southern edge of the lava pit, the one you 
        want is the western one, which will take you to Nagafen's Lair.
      <p>There are multiple zones from Solusek's Eye (Sol A) into Nagafen's Lair. 
        These are frequently used as escapes from Nagafen's Lair into Sol A, but 
        be aware that they are also used for the same purpose on the other side, 
        and you may be going from the frying pan into the fire when you appear 
        on the other side...
