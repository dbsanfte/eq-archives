<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">In response to Rimm:
Actually, the full post was regarding someone who was complaining about the lack of GM-run events for the lower levels, in the wake of the Halloween events which were (without exception) for higher level characters.  My complaint was about how he referred to everything below 50th level as a "transitional" level, but I could also complain that they aren't making any new content for lower levels.

As an example, I'll review the changes that are significant that I can remember for the lower levels, since I've been playing this game since the second or third beta (I don't even remember).  When the game started out, I remember Hook referring to the continent of Antonica as the "continent of random death" largely because of the hill giants and griffins around there (more on this later).  The first big change was the addition of quests that actually did something in terms of experience, somewhere around August after the game came out.  This was a big step, because now quests were actually useful to do.  Sometime after that, the one lower-level "uber" quest was introduced for the Stein of Maggok.  Very cool quest.  Then, sometime this spring (after lots of testing) they introduced the quest armor quests for players in the high-20's to 30's in level.  Twinking became more prevalent as people reached higher levels.  Times were good.  (Note that this is honestly about all I can remember as significant additions for lower levels, comment if I missed any).

But remember that all this time, things were also getting harder.  Monsters were getting tweaked to overcome their inherently poor AI, and were given super powers.  The ability to attack through walls, cast while running and never be interrupted or run out of mana.  No damage caps on attacks.  The list goes on and on.  The "continent of random death" spread out, and I can't remember the last time a HG or griffin caught me flat-footed and got off a shot at me, because they are the least of my concerns now.  Now I can't run through Kithicor at night, or Lesser Fay at any time.  I can't hunt the mino caves in Steamfont without terror that the Hero will spawn.  Splitpaw and Kerra Isle (Ridge, whatever you want to call it) are no longer playable below 20th or 30th.  The newbie areas of Everfrost have 10th level skeletons roaming them now.  Cazel roams Oasis for days at a time because nobody can kill him.  The dragons have all been tweaked to be more "challenging" as well as the gods in the planes.

There are more but I'll stop.  My point is that the plusses to the game for low levels have not been very many.  Kunark was mostly a high-level addition, with a few exceptions (Lake of Ill Omen for people in their 20's, Kurn's Tower for teen-level necros, a couple of others for 30th level people).  The minuses to the game for low-levels are many, and *mostly* because of this drive to improve the game for higher-level people.  50 levels and an ungodly number of played hours are not "transitional" when Verant themselves states that the majority of players will never get to kill a dragon or go to a plane, etc.
