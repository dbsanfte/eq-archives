[B]My suggestion to anyone taking Verant's side in this debate is to actually attempt to cruise Norrath AS IF IT WERE A REAL WORLD in which hardy adventurers, well, um, SOUGHT ADVENTURE. Your journey might go something like this....

Ah, what a promising day! Myself and five other brave souls pledged today to make an assault on the legendary Lost Temple of Cazic Thule. After making the trek from Lake Rathe through the dangerous mountains and the swamp, we arrived at the forbidding temple, which, we had all been told, was inhabited and owned by lizard men, evil creatures whom we all swore to slay and deprive of loot.

Imagine our surprise when we entered the temple and found that its fiercest inhabitants -- at least at the levels of the compound we dared explore -- were fellow adventurers.

After announcing our arrival and hearing a distant shout from other adventurers -- something about the silvery room or somesuch, we decided to forsake the courtyard and seize the lizard's throne room. Upon arrival we found it sparsely populated by the evil lizards and promptly cleared the joint.

At which point, I foolishly ventured upstairs and ran into several powerful lizards who smote me and several of my companions into the ground.

Awakening from our deaths, we thanked the kindly cleric who saved us the afterlife trek and returned to the throne room, only to find that it was now occupied by a pair of godlike fellow adventurers who were blasting the room with their mighty magics for seconds at a time, sitting for a minute or two, and repeating the process. They were there, I was told, in search of an elusive lizardscale cloak, although why they sought such an item was beyond my understanding, as it paled in comparison to their own godlike wardrobes. Perhaps they were capitalists.

At any rate, we didn't want to get in the way of such powerful magics, so we regrouped and returned to the courtyard, announcing our arrival once more. Once more a distant voice muttered something about the silvery wossname and some avatar.

Deciding once more to plumb the depths of the mysterious lizard's compound, we made our way inside the temple, where, I had been told, crawled tough alligators and a lizard champion you could reach by swimming down a mysterious well. Imagine our surprise when we found the well surrounded by ... lizards? Gators? NO! Fellow adventurers!

While these brave souls were not nearly as godlike as the ones we previously encountered, and were closer in abilities and in stature to us, they sought to lay claim to a larger swath of the temple then the demigods we had encountered in the throne room. The strangers around the well insisted that they had just cleared the well and that whatever was beneath it was theirs.

Having been under the impression all this time that it was the lizards that owned the temple, and realizing that our competitors, as it were, hadn't yet ventured down the well nor broken the territory we sought to claim, I shrugged, declared open season and instructed my mates to race down the well.

In the ensuing battle, we narrowly defeated the lizard champion and his gator minions, and while we obtained little loot, much exhilaration was had by all, save our competitors, who began berating us for "stealing their camp".

Having been challenged to a duel to resolve the matter by the competitor's captain, I sent my team's champion in my place, and our champion triumphed in a close and well-fought battle.

Thus, exhausted, in order of occurence, by our lengthy trek, my tactical error of running around the throne room, resurrection, returning to the throne room to find it camped by enterprising demigods, racing down a well to fight a pitched battle, and fending off competitors' insults, we decided to call it a night.

Bidding farewell to our competitors, we gave them the broken battlefield as a gift, hoping that the matter had been resolved honorably. We were told that while the conclusion had been honorable, we did in fact "still suck."

A similar fate awaits all who expect Norrath to be a battlefield rife with strife and the promise of adventure and instead discover a rich geography and bestiary reduced to a mere field of resources argued over by competing squatters.

You're in THEIR world now, and kudos to Muse for realizing it.
