      <p align="left">The following guide was put together to hopefully give you 
        an idea of which cities are good to start in, regardless of the consideration 
        of race and class and religion.</p>
      <h2 align="center"><a href="akanon.html">Ak'Anon</a></h2>
      The city of the gnomes...
<h3 align="left">Advantages</h3>
      <p align="left">It is possible (in fact suggested) that you reach 4th or 
        5th level within the city itself. This also has one of the handiest tough 
        critter zones on all of Faydwer, roughly 8th-10th level critters walking 
        all over the place. Plus, minotaur caves and axes... Need I say more?</p>
      <h3 align="left">Disadvantages</h3>
      <p align="left">City is somewhat confusing and slow to get around. Newbie 
        mines are a maze and it isn't easy to run for help if caught and in trouble. 
        I lost my first character by swimming up between a walkway and a building 
        and getting wedged there, and being unable to escape. Don't do that. Have 
        to leave your zone entirely to fight higher than 5th level critters.</p>
      <p align="left"></p>
      <h3 align="left">Rating: 7</h3>
      <h2 align="center"><a href="kunark/cabilis.html">Cabilis</a></h2>
      <p>The city of the Iksar.<br>
      </p>
      <h3 align="left">Advantages</h3>
      <p align="left">There are four separate zones that you can choose to fight 
        in as a newbie, each with merchants that sell food and weapons. There 
        are also a number of newbie quests that, if you pursue, make the game 
        quite fun and challenging early on.</p>
      <h3 align="left">Disadvantages</h3>
      <p align="left">The city itself is two zones wide, and you really need to 
        learn how to get in and out of the water efficiently or it can be frustrating 
        to move around within it. Merchants tend to be scattered around. Secret 
        areas within city are deadly to newbies.</p>
      <p align="left"></p>
      <h3 align="left">Rating: 8</h3>
      <h3 align="left">&nbsp;</h3>
      <h2 align="center"><a href="erudin.html">Erudin</a></h2>
      <p>The city of High Man...<br>
      </p>
      <h3 align="left">Advantages</h3>
      <p align="left">The newbie fighting area in front of Erudin is well-protected 
        from the tougher zones by a river and a bridge, so you can't get too lost. 
        There are also merchants who sell stuff outside of the city. This keeps 
        you from having to zone to buy necessary items.</p>
      <h3 align="left">Disadvantages</h3>
      <p align="left">If you want to travel outside the zone it is a 10 minute 
        boat ride to Qeynos, plus all the zoning in between. Get used to begging 
        to be bound. There is a slight jump in difficulty when going across the 
        bridge for the first time, and you can be wiped by roaming skeletons quickly. 
        Not many people play here, it can get lonely...</p>
      <p align="left"></p>
      <h3 align="left">Rating: 7</h3>
      <h2 align="center"><a href="felwithe.html">Felwithe</a></h2>
      <p align="left">The city of the High Elves...</p>
      <h3 align="left">Advantages</h3>
      <p align="left">Any city on the island of Faydwer has access to the other 
        cities and their zones, which means if it's too crowded here, go elsewhere. 
        It also isn't far to recover your body in any of the other zones. By roaming 
        to the other zones, you can easily find creatures your level to battle. 
        There are also plenty of other adventurers to join with.</p>
      <h3 align="left">Disadvantages</h3>
      <p align="left">The newbie area is extremely crowded, due to Kelethin being 
        nearby and these two races being very popular. Greater Faydark itself 
        is very confusing, especially after you wander off the paths. Getting 
        lost in orc town is a problem. Access to Antonica is limited by the eternal 
        boat ride from Kaladim to Freeport.</p>
      <h3 align="left">Rating: 6</h3>
      <h2 align="center"><a href="freeport.html">Freeport</a></h2>
      <p align="left">One of the cities of Man.</p>
      <h3 align="left">Advantages</h3>
      <p align="left">Good newbie areas. Access to boat to Faydwer. Heading south 
        to the Desert of Ro leads you to an area well-populated with 1st-5th level 
        creatures. Easy access to food and drink, as well as the Commonlands nearby. 
        Lots of good creatures to group against. Many quests and merchants in 
        the area to keep it interesting. Also there are a good number of nearby 
        zones for higher level characters to adventure in, including the croc 
        killing grounds in the Oasis of Marr and Befallen, a tough dungeon for 
        levels 7-27. Best area to work on blacksmithing.</p>
      <h3 align="left">Disadvantages</h3>
      <p align="left">Occasional wandering madmen in Northern Ro are aggressive 
        and very tough, and guards won't save you from them. With the city split 
        up into three separate zones with two newbie areas, it can be confusing 
        at first to find your way around.</p>
      <h3 align="left">Rating: 7</h3>
      <h2 align="center"><a href="grobb.html">Grobb</a></h2>
      <p align="left">The troll city attached to the swamps...</p>
      <h3 align="left">Advantages</h3>
      <p align="left">There is a great deal of newbie material in Innothule Swamp 
        and nearby Feerrott. Of note, the frogloks are rich and often swathed in 
        magical cloth armor. I've never had richer characters than my troll.</p>
      <h3 align="left">Disadvantages</h3>
      <p align="left">You only have two zones to travel around in when starting 
        out. You can really get stir crazy after a while and want to move on. 
        Although there are zones nearby, the next 5th to 6th level zone is on 
        the other side of the Feerrott, which is a very long walk if you get killed. 
        For that reason, many stay and kill frogloks for weeks, but that can get 
        tiresome. No bear pelts for patchwork. Very difficult to work on any trade 
        skills down here.</p>
      <h3 align="left">Rating: 7</h3>
      <h2 align="center"><a href="halas.html">Halas</a></h2>
      <p align="left">My most fun beta character was a Shaman from Halas, who 
        I acquired after some bug turned my 1st level Warrior into a 4th level 
        Shaman. I didn't complain. </p>
      <h3 align="left">Advantages</h3>
      <p align="left">This has one of the two best newbie areas for sheer number 
        of critters and wealth attainable. Just kill everything in sight. Also 
        has pelts available to make patchwork for yourself and your smaller neighbors 
        to the south. Once you map out the zone, it's pretty easy to find your 
        way around in and small enough to manage.</p>
      <h3 align="left">Disadvantages</h3>
      <p align="left">You are *way* in the boondocks. If you don't like your barbarian 
        friends, you had better get used to running through Blackburrow in the 
        pitch black to retrieve your body. Doesn't sound like fun? Also, some 
        of the &quot;low level&quot; quests involve some really dangerous areas.</p>
      <h3 align="left">Rating: 8</h3>
      <h2 align="center"><a href="kaladim.html">Kaladim</a></h2>
      <p align="left">The dwarven mine turned city...</p>
      <h3 align="left">Advantages</h3>
      <p align="left">Butcherblock Mountains have to be the best hunting grounds 
        in terms of having creatures available for every level imaginable. I didn't 
        leave there until 6th level, and then not because I had to. Easiest access 
        to the boat to Freeport.</p>
      <h3 align="left">Disadvantages</h3>
      <p align="left">City itself gets some taking used to walking around. Lots 
        of instances of some random huge monster walking by and swatting everyone 
        (&quot;where did that undead pawn come from?&quot;). Need to go elsewhere 
        to get pelts.</p>
      <h3 align="left">Rating: 7</h3>
      <h2 align="center"><a href="kelethin.html">Kelethin</a></h2>
      <p align="left">Tree city (makes me more scared of heights).</p>
      <h3 align="left">Advantages</h3>
      <p align="left">Very easy access to the city (no zoning needed). Once you 
        know your way around, easy to get to anywhere. Many small creatures to 
        kill, with the orcs providing the occasional exp boost. Provides a great 
        deal of goods if you know where to look.</p>
      <h3 align="left">Disadvantages</h3>
      <p align="left">Tends to be a very busy area, along with Felwithe. Also, 
        orcs tend to be overwhelming and group so much that even my high-level 
        characters would occasionally die from their swarms. Makes my palms sweat 
        cuz I'm scared of heights.</p>
      <h3 align="left">Rating: 6</h3>
      <h2 align="center"><a href="neriak.html">Neriak</a></h2>
      <p align="left">The dark elven city below...</p>
      <h3 align="left">Advantages</h3>
      <p align="left">A world unto itself, you could adventure down here for weeks 
        on end. Creatures are tough, but you advance quickly because of it. Newbie 
        area has many areas of different difficulty to hunt in, as well as many 
        quests to enjoy.</p>
      <h3 align="left">Disadvantages</h3>
      <p align="left">City itself is very large and confusing. </p>
      <h3 align="left">Rating: 7</h3>
      <h2 align="center"><a href="oggok.html">Oggok</a></h2>
      <p align="left">The ogres smelly city...</p>
      <h3 align="left">Advantages</h3>
      <p align="left">Very small city that is easy to get around in. Lots of good 
        regions between here and by Grobb for newbies on up, and you can smash 
        all day long. Not too many random wandering evil monsters.</p>
      <h3 align="left">Disadvantages</h3>
      <p align="left">No bear pelts for patchwork. The best mid-level hunting 
        around is probably frogloks, and they are almost two long zones away. 
        Easy to get lost in this large zone. Most creatures are aggressive around 
        here.</p>
      <h3 align="left">Rating: 6</h3>
      <h2 align="center"><a href="paineel.html">Paineel</a></h2>
      <p align="left">Home of the Heretics on Odus.</p>
      <h3 align="left">Advantages</h3>
      <p align="left"> Great newbie ground with tons of easy monsters in low-levels. 
        Tons of quests. Finally a home for the evil Erudites.</p>
      <h3 align="left">Disadvantages</h3>
      <p align="left">Newbie zone is a ways away from trainers. Isolated on Odus, 
        and difficult to get off island safely because you have to go through 
        Erudin, unless you travel via Nexus.</p>
      <h3 align="left">Rating: 9</h3>
      <h3 align="left">&nbsp;</h3>
      <h2 align="center"><a href="qeynos.html">Qeynos</a></h2>
      <p align="left">The other human port city... It's also Muse's hometown.</p>
      <h3 align="left">Advantages</h3>
      <p align="left">Very well fleshed out city. Really gives you the feel of 
        being in a port town. Readily accessible to many different zones, including 
        the starting zone for rangers and druids and Blackburrow. You could adventure 
        for weeks and never leave the area. Easy access to a lot of other zones, 
        really feels like a melting pot with barbarians, Erudites, humans and 
        half-elves all around.</p>
      <h3 align="left">Disadvantages</h3>
      <p align="left">Newbie area can sometimes get very crowded, and the only 
        2nd level critters (fire beetles and Klikniks) are groupers.</p>
      <h3 align="left">Rating: 9</h3>
      <h2 align="center"><a href="rivervale.html">Rivervale</a></h2>
      <p align="left">Home of the Halflings.</p>
      <h3 align="left">Advantages</h3>
      <p align="left"> Great newbie ground with lots of fire-beatles and spiderlings 
        everywhere. After that is easy cross a big wall to the harder creatures. 
        Lots of pelts from wolves here. Also good fishing with a pond inside the 
        town. Probably the most even graduation to higher levels from levels 1-12 
        around. </p>
      <h3 align="left">Disadvantages</h3>
      <p align="left">Isolated except from Freeport. Confusing city with a lot 
        of things looking the same. </p>
      <h3 align="left">Rating: 9</h3>
      <h2 align="center"><a href="luclin/sharvahl.html">Shar Vahl</a></h2>
      <p align="left">Home of the Vah Shir.</p>
      <h3 align="left">Advantages</h3>
      <p align="left"> Compact main city. Newbie area can support levels 1-10, 
        and adjacent zones provide for levels much higher than that.</p>
      <h3 align="left">Disadvantages</h3>
      <p align="left">Long way to any nearby city. City can be quite laggy. Nearby 
        Hollowshade Moor is strangely quite high levelled given the roaming monsters.</p>
