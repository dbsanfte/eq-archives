Other sites have recently posted something that Gordon said, I've included the relevant bits here:<P><B>As far as camping goes, about all we determined is that people differ widely in opinion on the issue. One of the most common suggestions is that we work actively to promote more rewards for playing the game in the preferred manner, and leave rewards as they currently exist for camping.<P>Unfortunately, doing that would require making playing the game in the preferred manner easier, safer, faster, or more profitable, which would in our opinion decrease the fun to be had from it. In our opinion, there is more fun to be had from playing the game in the preferred manner than by camping, and that fun should be the sufficient additional reward to get people to do it.<P>However it's obviously not, so we're left with reducing the reward for camping as an option. Of course, many made it clear in the threads they they prefer camping over doing anything else in the game. Hence our quandry.</B><P>He goes on to say that they're not going to make any changes. You can find the full post <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008246.html" TARGET=_blank>here</A>.<P>I thought I'd discuss this. Reading through the above post carefully, I've determined that the true flaw at Verant is that their use of logic is basically non-existent. In a nutshell, they've stated that the way they <I>intended</I> the game is that the benefit of "fun" that you obtain by playing the game the right way should balance out the other benefits of camping (better loot, more money, slower pace), "however it's obviously not." You're correct on that one, Gordon.<P>However, he goes on to state that the possible correction to that, making it "easier, safer, faster, or more profitable" would actually <I>decrease</I> our enjoyment of the game. Call me crazy, but if he made those changes, everyone I know in game wouldn't have been upset they didn't get into the <A HREF="http://www.anarchy-online.com" TARGET=_blank>AO beta</A> (myself included). That's exactly what people want, and if Verant did that, it seems in line with their Vision where the preferred method was more fun.<P>However, Gordon goes on to state that they can't do that. ?? Which leaves them with nerfing, if you will, camping. ?? They don't want to do that because some people apparently actually <I>enjoy</I> camping (and cuz 50,000 accounts being cancelled in one day would really hurt the bottom line), so they're going to leave things the way they are.<P>In a nutshell, what Gordon is saying is this: <B>Doing a dungeon, as per our Vision, turned out to not be as fun or rewarding as we planned. We cannot enhance this, because that would, trust us on this one, actually <I>decrease</I> your fun. The only option to make it more fun than camping would, in fact, be to make camping even less fun. Since we don't want you all to have less fun, you can plainly see how we are forced to make no changes.</B><P>It sounds like the Sicilian in the Princess Bride. And I don't think Verant could come up with a way to make camping even less fun (I know I can't), so that's not really an option. The only way what he said above makes any sense is if you pay attention to where he stuck "in our opinion."  If you do, then it comes clear that Verant thinks it's more fun to do it the right way and you should do it for that reason, however people for reasons  unknown to them simply don't. This is what we in the field of  logic describe as a state of being <I>wrong</I>.<P>Feel free to discuss.<P>-------------------<BR>Muse<BR>Bard and Cartographer<p>[This message has been edited by Muse (edited 08-27-2000).]

I don't know about you, but I understand Verant's Logic in that, "...playing the game in the preferred manner easier, safer, faster, or more profitable..." would decrease the fun. Let me share the logic Verant is using, since most people don't get it.<P>Think about this: What if all the enemies you had to kill were also extremely easy and more plentiful? Yes, you would make more money, until you realize that everyone else was making just as much more. Yes, you may net more experience, but only until you realize that everyone else was netting just as much more.<P>In the end, everyone will be growing at an accelerated rate, making your accomplishments mean no more than they did before the enhancements. The only difference: There would be very little challenge involved. The less you have to think, the more boring a task becomes. This means people will eventually get more bored, and will whine even more about "Camping SUCKS" and what not. This would put Verant right back at square one. Why do *anything* when this would be the end result?<P>I didn't say whether or not I agree with this; but Verant's logic is far from senseless once you really think in the long-term. <P>Just wanted to share that.  <IMG SRC="http://www.eqatlas.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>Thillian (insert name here)<BR>20th Season Cleric, Bertoxxulous<BR>Proud member of the Alliance of the Stars

For those who think by making things easier would unbalance the game:<P>Simply you don't just change the mobs.  Take any dungeon, you decrease the mobs toughness, add more of them, decrease the agro radius a bit tweak spawn rates so that an appropriate level group could move to the next spawn in a reasonable period of time.  This is what would give incentive to "do dungeons".<P>And I think Muse has been reading my EQ Forum posts.  I just yesterday refered to that guy from the Princess Bride always saying inconveivable, and likened it to Abashi an balance.<P>Eryl Flynn Level 45 Wood Elf Bard on Prexus

Or another option, put MORE of the same level dungeons/camps in the game. My trouble is it is EASY to get to certain levels, then when you have to move on the level is SO much higher that you LOSE levels or are FORCED to group with people you DON"T know, or know and would rather eat RAZORBLADES than group with(they can't play their class to save YOUR life etc). I have been forced to ask around and move around the game from contentent to contentent and SEARCH forums and "hint" sites to find areas I can solo when either guildmates or friends are NOT online(much of my game time is this way).<BR>  ALSO adding "camping manners" to the "play nice" rules, would help. For instance, you enter a zone and shout "Camp check" and others shout out what camp they are claiming and if YOU want it and it is CAMPED, MOVE ON.<BR>NOTHING chaps my FANNY more than camp stealers or Kill Stealers.

I'm going to make this quick because I got to go to school soon. Lastnight I was playing and camping DVinn, just for revenge. Well, just as I brokethe throne room, I had to go to bed. Well, on my way out I trained a oracle anda emmissary. I charmed the emmissary and used hime to kill the oracle, which just seeingthat was fun, so to at about 1:30pm PST on morrel-thule I'm going to do a big orc vs orc arena, because all of us have died at the hands of those orcs to many times.

Ah...good.  =)<P>thillian: <P>&gt;&gt;Think about this: What if all the enemies you had to kill were also extremely easy and more plentiful? &lt;&lt;<P>You only argue your point to the extreme.  No mature gamer has ever said "I want to be able to solo Sol B with my Warrior".  Simply, though, it should be less of a challenge when fending off monsters that are 15 levels below you.  <P>I am an avid player of D&D and also usually wind up being the DM (lack of options, really).  In D&D, your 15th level character could walk into an orc camp, waste around 20-30 orcs and walk out with a few minor bruises.  In EQ, you would get slaughtered.  The scope of the game is really centered around the players being some sort of adventurer, but not a hero, which is a common mistake made by many.  The real problem lies in the fact that it is hard to believe that as the character grows in power, they can still be beaten by low level mobs.  Do you think that a Mist Wolf should take down a 25th level mage with no pet?  I have seen it happen.<P>In any case, my point is that the game ought to be evened out a bit more.  At 26th level, i still and kinda afraid of going into BlackBurrow, even though i would not get exp for ~anything~ there, they can still wipe the floor with me.<P>"That ain't right"<BR>

Well, to me this is just more proof that the EQ staff has no one with professional experience in a service-related position.  They seem more like a bunch of gamers who have stumbled into a position of power and it has gone to their heads.  Sad when such an obvious ego trip gets in the way of what COULD be an awesome game, but which settles for being adequate in order to satisify the ego needs of the staff.  Besides all the obvious issues with the game, the customer support (and treatment of customers) is atrocious.  Some of the reasons I have seen on the boards for suspending accounts would lead to a lawsuit if they tried it on me.  These people need to wake up and realize this is JUST A GAME.  Anyway, enough ranting, EQ will quickly fade away as some of the more customer-responsive games in beta reach the open market.  Then I suspect Brad and Gordon and company will be left sitting there wondering what happened.

So far, this thread isn't getting to whiney like the official EQ Forums and I hope it stays that way, however, I must say that introducing too many topics like this could lead to the whiners invading us.<P>That said, Muse, I've said it before, you are an invaluable resource to this game! Your maps of course stand at the forefront of important resources, however, other stuff you have done with this site have helped us all too. I hope that these forums can maintain the air they have thus far and not degenerate. <P>About camping dungeons. I must admit, I haven't done or camped many dungeons. I'm a 25th lvl Paladin and never found Befallen much fun. I look forward to starting doing dungeons some day as a lot of players in my guild sing their praises.<P>Still, after reading some stuff on this topic, I had posted an idea for a playable dungeon that I really like. Later, someone else posted a similar description.<P>I won't recap the entire description, but the general idea is a dungeon is made up of one-group-at-a-time zones. Mobs do not respawn until you leave a zone after which you cannot re-enter for some very long period of time. And, in the ideal world, there would be some way to enforce a time limit on a group's stay in the zone (in case they are trying to be jerks about it and just sit there with nothing to fight).<P>Later I elaborated on the idea. And this I really like. Why not make the zone reproduceable. Every group that enters a particular dungeon gets an instance of that dungeon all for that group. If another group enters the same dungeon, another instance of the zone is created on the server for that group. Ok, not realistic, but would definitely give you that dungeon feel - hands down!<P>Be Safe and Good Hunting<P>Rylius

A few comments:<P>1. "...playing the game in the preferred manner easier, safer, faster, or more profitable..." <P>I agree that I don't think things should be made easier. That's the lazy man's way out.<P>2. To SolClaryn, who says: "Or another option, put MORE of the same level dungeons/camps in the game."<P>   Personally, I think there's plenty of places to hunt at the same levels. People tend to get stuck hunting in the same places, while dozens of camps go UNPLAYED. I have hunted in Lesser Fay an orc camp, that never once in my over a dozen visits, has EVER been camped. I have hunted Kerra Isle, levels 10-25 or so, and in the entire ZONE I have never seen more than two others outside of my group. There's dozens of such examples. To say there are not enough places just means you need to look around more.<P>3. To DJAVulkai, who says: "In any case, my point is that the game ought to be evened out a bit more. At 26th level, i still and kinda afraid of going into BlackBurrow, even though i would not get exp for ~anything~ there, they can still wipe the floor with me."<P>"That ain't right"<P>Personally, I don't think there's anything wrong with this. D&D's system was totally flawed anyway. I mean come on, according to the old rules a 25th level fighter could jump off of a 4,000 foot cliff, land, dust himself off, and proceed to singlehandedly destroy an army or 3,000 orcs. And you use that as a basis for comparison?<P>You walk into a gnoll lair at 26, you SHOULD have SOME fear. Numbers do account for something.<P>4. To dearjohn, who says: "Some of the reasons I have seen on the boards for suspending accounts would lead to a lawsuit if they tried it on me. These people need to wake up and realize this is JUST A GAME. "<P>Excuse me but, you want people to realize it's JUST A GAME, while simultaneously threaten a LAWSUIT? C'mon guy, a little consistency would make a more powerful argument.<P>Also, you say:<P>"Anyway, enough ranting, EQ will quickly fade away as some of the more customer-responsive games in beta reach the open market. Then I suspect Brad and Gordon and company will be left sitting there wondering what happened."<P>Rant away all you want, it's your right after all. But if you don't like the game that much, go play something else. Just how many of your ideas would you like to see in the game for your whole $10 per month? Personally, I don't have any major complaints with the game whatsoever. It's still the most enjoyable game out there for me, and I have no plans on leaving.<P>Lastly,<P>5. To Rylius, who says: "Later I elaborated on the idea. And this I really like. Why not make the zone reproduceable. Every group that enters a particular dungeon gets an instance of that dungeon all for that group. If another group enters the same dungeon, another instance of the zone is created on the server for that group. Ok, not realistic, but would definitely give you that dungeon feel - hands down!"<P>A nice idea, but one that I think would be hugely unpopular. You wouldn't be able to just go explore a new dungeon at all unless you rounded up a group first, and it's harder to find people to group with when you don't know the dungeon at all. It would also make it impossible to find a group AFTER you've entered a dungeon. And when a group lost a member or two, they might be FORCED to exit the dungeon to try to find replacements, meanwhile having JUST MISSED some others calling out to group that left the zone after not having found someone, knowing it's impossible to get a group while INSIDE the dungeon.<P>Another example: Say I want to take my level 17 bard, and risk his life heading down to Lower Guk to get the Mask of Deception, a drop that is lore and no drop so often poofs. I don't think that choice should be made an impossibility for me.<P>Just a few offhand observations about that.<P>

Gorgash,<P>Some good thoughts on the reproduceable dungeon idea - thanks... here are some responses:<P>On not being able to wander the dungeon to get to know it... well, yes, certainly a possible disadvantage, but... If the idea is to get to more of a pencil and paper feel to dungeons, then you don't know anything about a dungeon when you go there. That was a great part of D&D. However, we must also remember that we have Muse to rely on, so I'm sure we will at least have maps in hand when we enter the dungeon.<P>On deaths in the group... First, this depends on which idea is developed - strictly one-group-at-a-time zones vs. Reproduceable zones. If it's reproduceable zones, the dead player could return as long as his group is still in there.<P><BR>If it's the other... well, I love this part. I think it's great that a group might not be able to successfully complete the dungeon if they have too many deaths. OK, EQ is not permanent death, nor should it be! It's great that our characters can be fearless, ok a little fear of Exp loss. But here is a part of the game that will at least simulate the feeling of really trying to accomplish something without dying. Sure, you may have to wait a day or a few hours to try again if you fail, but imagine the satisfaction of finally completing the whole dungeon with minimal loss!<P>In general, these styles of dungeons are not meant to meet anyone's entire EQ experience needs and perhaps no major no drop items should be placed here. The idea is to provide a pencil and paper feel dungeon that groups must try to complete on their own with no distractions. Other dungeon types should still exist in the game.<P>Well, this is a fun discussion... keep it up!<BR><P>------------------<BR>Rylius Elfheart<BR>Paladin of Tunare, 25th Season<BR>Dragonhood of Marr<BR>Mith Marr Server

I would just like to comment on Verrant saying "in our opinion" the gae would be more fun. Heh. This is them saying, if people actually could play the game and enjoy it without having to fight off greenies to get to where you need to be, if they did not have to take a 15 min boat ride, if they did not have to wait 20 min for a spawn just to get a key to go further on to the next key holder to finally get to where you get exp, etc. etc. etc., then they might actually enjoy themslves and feel good about playing once they log off. The problem with this is that Verrant wants people to stay on line as long as they can get us to doing tasks that will do nothing but delay any real game advancment. Sure looking at Verrants business side of it, it means more money. But come on, lets not get greedy here. Beleive it or not Verrant, we actually like to have FUN while playing games.<BR>Just my 2cp on that.  <IMG SRC="http://www.eqatlas.com/ubb/smile.gif">

Muse:<P>I have to completely disagree with your interpretation of Verant's (or Gordon's, not sure who's responsible for this position) logic.  What they're saying is "Doing a dungeon, as per our Vision, turned out to not be as rewarding as camping it, but still a heck of a lot more fun.  We have two choices to change this, either make camping less rewarding, or make 'doing' the dungeon more rewarding.  We don't like either of those choices.  We don't want to nerf camping, because some people like it, and we don't want to make 'doing' the dungeon easier, because that would make the game too easy."<P>I think this is totally reasonable.  A lot of times the most effective way to achieve a goal isn't necessarily the most fun.  You have to decide which is more important to you, the end goal, or the path to reaching it.<P>You can argue whether the game is too easy or not, but that's really a matter of personal preference.  No matter what Verant does, they're not going to please everybody.

On Ladel's comments:<P>I can see how what they said could be interpreted this way.  My hangup is more with their argument, where they state that their intent was to make it more fun to do the game the preferred way, but for whatever reason this isn't fun to people.  This could also be interpreted as saying that, although it is more fun, people still don't do it because it isn't as profitable as camping (in terms of whatever measure you use, exp, gold, etc.).<P>My problem, I guess, is more with the fact that they assume that they would have to make a huge change to the game in order to make the preferred method more profitable (or more fun) so that people would do it more.  All I'm asking for is that they make it even possible to do things the preferred way.<P>One thing that stops this is the huge level variation in dungeons.  For instance, in Blackburrow the people who get exp at the top get butchered at the bottom, and the bottom people walk through the top with impunity.  Many of the Kunark dungeons are a lot better about this than the original ones.<P>The other problem, though, and in my opinion the biggest one, is the fact that the game, despite having a "preferred method" of doing the dungeon, is in fact designed for people to camp.  Spawns and drops are static, so people looking for a particular item go to that room and set up shop.  This means that even if you were to try to do the dungeon, you'd have vast areas of the "trash" to fight through, punctuated by rooms where the cool stuff spawns, but is now filled with some group.<P>This has led to something of a mini arms race where, because things were set up statically from the beginning, Verant had to come up with a way of making it a challenge for the people who might camp them.  This process is where we got NPC's with infinite mana, who can run while casting, who seem to resist our spells with impunity, who have no damage caps, etc.<P>The side effect of this is that it is now mostly impossible to "do" a dungeon the way they intended because of static spawns and camping.  In the perfect dungeon (e.g. Najena, which is do-able), basically your group would have to go from room-to-room breaking spawns all along the way, a process which we all know is the most dangerous step in any dungeon.  Although this *is* fun, the simple fact is that you will probably die at one point doing this, simply because you are engaging in this high-risk behavior of perpetually fighting hordes of super-powerful monsters.  What was fun a moment ago now becomes painful, because now you have to do corpse recovery in a dungeon in which, for balance purposes, many monsters can see through invis, invis drops with little warning, a mix of undead and regular and no stacking of appropriate spells makes it hard, doors are locked with keys on bodies, an unspaced spawn could refill the room within 30 seconds, making it a death trap while you loot your body, etc.  Oh, and there are not many times that a high-level cleric or paladin is even in these lower zones to come exp rez you, mitigating that danger.  Even in higher level zones they simply can't leave their group and come to you, nor can you safely drag to them.<P>The whole point is that you cannot do dungeons in all but a very few select ones (Dalnir, Kaesora, Najena, for instance).  Even stating that it's fun but not as rewarding is ignoring the fact that it's simply not possible.  I guess it technically is if you really don't mind dying and losing half a bubble of exp (i.e. 1-2 hours of time, not counting CR), but that doesn't cut it for me.  A correction to make it "easier, safer, faster, or more profitable" might actually make this stuff possible.  I also realize that it would make camping easier (cuz people would just "camp" the "doing" of a dungeon, sadly).<P>Now, I also know the counterargument to what I stated above, which Verant time and time again uses, and that is that people who are willing to take the higher associated risk and the penalties involved with that risk should, by virtue of their (bravery?) reap the benefits.  This does make sense when seen from a certain angle, but let me propose a different possibility:<P>People bought this game to have fun.  For some people, feeling like they've overcome a huge adversity is fun.  For some people, finishing the game in one week or less is fun.  For some people, simply the playing of it is fun.  I count myself as one of the latter people, and obviously no one game will satisfy all three groups.  However, I think there is a middle-ground to all of this.  I, when I started this game, thought someday I'd fight a dragon or a god, especially if I put in enough energy and time.  I personally feel the game would be just as much fun if, instead of taking 200 hours of play time (that's a time pulled out of a hat) to hit 50th, it instead took only 50-75 hours.  This game, though, caters to the extreme one end of the spectrum where you must devote your life to hitting 50th in order to see some of the coolest parts of the world.  I think everyone who buys the game should be able to do that, and the way it is now we can't, and Verant is okay with that, and that's what bugs me.<P>------------------<BR>Muse<BR>Bard and Cartographer

For the record, I need to repeat that I didn't necessarily agree with either side in what I said.<P>My main idea was that many people on gameplay will argue a point until it gets to the extreme.

Muse:<P>Let me see if I can paraphrase <I>your</I> logic:<P>It's not possible to 'do' most dungeons in the game today for two reasons.  First, because the range of levels from top to bottom is too high in most dungeons.  Second, because most of the interesting encounters are camped, so you either have to pass up all the interesting stuff, or join the camp.<P>To answer the first point, I have to go back to my D&D days (which are longer ago than I care to admit).  When we 'did' a dungeon in D&D, we would go in and fight our way down until we had more loot than we could carry, or (more likely) until we met something that kicked our butts. Then we'd limp back to town to sell stuff and rest.  When we had recovered, we'd go back in, and hopefully make it farther the next time.  When we were finally able to defeat the biggest nasties in the place, we'd usually leave and never look back.<P>I don't see why Everquest dungeons can't work the same way.  There's no reason (except for the few one-way doors) that you have to be able to fight the whole dungeon in one sitting, or even one level.  <P>To answer the second point, we have to go back to my original post.  How do we stop people from camping?  Either we nerf camping or we make not camping more rewarding.<P>The problem is, anything you do to make not-camping more rewarding will make camping more rewarding still. If the dungeon is set up as an increasingly difficult challenge, for each group there's always going to be a "sweet spot", where the level of challenge best matches their abilities. Unless you somehow limit the ability to profit from staying in that spot (read: nerf camping), it's always going to be advantageous to stay there.<P>Finally, I'm afraid I have to agree with you that Verant seems to have pretty much accepted that not everyone who plays will get to do everything in the game.  That bugs me too, especially since I'm one of the people who will probably never get to do a lot of it.  But, in Verant's defense (since I'm being their apologist), that's intentional too.  Verant would prefer that <B>nobody</B> were able to do everything in the game.  The only reason some people have is that their capacity for obsessive game playing exceeds Verant's ability to create new challenges.  Is that the best way to design a game so that people have fun?  I don't know, but it may be the only way to get the obsessive powergamers into the same world with the rest of us and still have a chance.

Camping is FUN?????  Maybe if you are at a level that is significantly above the MoB.  If you camp an item--which Verant encourages thru their low spawn rates, etc.-- at the appropriate level for the MoB your biggest fear isn't the MoB, its the higher levels and other campers who will come in and try to steal your camp.  After assisting on 3 testament of Vanere (sp) camps of Dylinn I can tell you that FUN was not a word heard often.  A 7 1/2 hour spawn for a quest item needed for multiple classes is ridiculous. <BR> Camp stealers, RL weeks spent hoping to find only 1 group ahead of you, invisible KS'ers oh yeah thats why I enjoy the game.<P>For all those people who think that making a MoB easier is not the answer--well it seems that is coming from many people with high level characters.  What you might not realize is how much that MoB has been buffed since you originally did that dungeon or quest.  Even look at Kunark which has been made more dangerous since introduction just months before...If the Mobs were just set back to the way they originally were when these people first encountered and the "Lore" tag was used more often I think camping and farming would be decreased to the advantage of all.

Everyone who buys the game should have the same rights to see everything the game has to offer.  My main character is 22nd level, with a /played of about 12 days.  I shudder to think of what that time will be should I ever make 30th.  I have given up any hope of ever seeing 40th level.  Why should I miss out on the things a 40th level character can do just because I have other interests outside of EQ?  I pay the same amount for my 6-10 hours a week on EQ as do the folks who put in 60 hours a week.  Twisting this around a little bit, aren't I actually a more valuable customer to Verant, because for the same amount of money I use far less of their resources?  <P>Basically, though, Verant runs EQ just like MUD admins run their games - those who sink all the time into get all the rewards.  That works for MUDs though, because by and large they're FREE.  It doesn't fly when all your customers are being paid the same amount, but some are being denied parts of the game because they don't have the time to put into it that others do.<P>OK, that's long enough for now.  I still enjoy EQ, but only so long as my friends are around to group with.  With every hour of playtime I lose to a sudden death incurred through no action of my own (Grimfeather, anyone?), the fun:work ratio of EQ drops another notch.  If it drops much more, I'll expect them to be paying me for the experience  <IMG SRC="http://www.eqatlas.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P><P>------------------<BR><B>Arilan</B><BR>22 Cleric of Rodcet Nife<BR>Bertox server

I think that much of the fun of the game is being able to see the world from different perspectives and playing different characters.  I think a lot of the complaining on the big boards that "that class can do X better than me" is a side effect of the simple fact that *most* people are not going to be able to play multiple characters up to the 50's in level.  Of course they're mad, because they spent a ton of time playing a character that, in the long run, turned out to not be what they wanted to play, and now they're stuck with the thought of having to do it all over again.<P>Consider the alternative.  You can play to 50th in a few months of "regular" play time.  Given the amount of time I've put in (one char at 30th, two at 20th, multiple ones in early teens), I'd have a 55th lvl one and a few 40th level ones.  Everyone would have a stable of chars that they could pull out depending on their mood and where their friends wanted to hunt.<P>I think that if they made a few changes (level limits on weapon usage, most items no drop since they lack a better method to stop twinking, etc.), and made it so people could conceivably replay all the way through without maximum pain, then I think people would do it.  Then the servers wouldn't be so heavy with the super-powerful characters all the time, because those players would feel that they could spend their time playing a newbie without turning their back on months and months of time invested.  I know I would.<P>------------------<BR>Muse<BR>Bard and Cartographer

[QUOTE]Originally posted by Thillian:<BR>In the end, everyone will be growing at an accelerated rate, making your accomplishments mean no more than they did before the enhancements. The only difference: There would be very little challenge involved. The less you have to think, the more boring a task becomes. This means people will eventually get more bored, and will whine even more about "Camping SUCKS" and what not. This would put Verant right back at square one. Why do *anything* when this would be the end result?<P>True that would be the outcome but what if you increased the number of places the same item is avaliable. The dificulty of the task would stay the same but the frequency would increase and avaliability of the item would also increase, thereby lowering the "profitability" of camping and "Farming" th neat stuff<P>------------------<BR>Life is what happens when your busy making other plans

I have an idea to make dungeons duable.<P>Make GROUP quests.<BR>Have X npc hand out "Group" quests,  the quest is dependent on the lvl of the group.<BR>to complete the quest you go to x dungeon and kill x mobs, these mobs drop lore items that you bring back for a REAL amount of experience.  Make to loot drop based on the lvl. IE if a character out of the lvl range kills the Mob the loot does not drop, also the item can not be looted by some one not in the group.  Make the entire group be there when the quest is given, and the entire group come back upon completion.  The reward would have to =  not excede the reward for camping said dungeon.<P>Do NOT make the quest a 10 zone event, sorry but that is not the sort of thing a viable group will be able to accomplish,  unless of course they play 10 hours a day.<P>I think also to stop camping VI needs to look at the loot that is dropped.  Make the "item" equivelent to the lvl of the group that can take the monster, not 10 lvls lower.  Ie  what is the point in going to runneye to get the bibs when you already have the giagantic zwiehander?  the only thing to do with it is to sell it.  <P>Normally, in my experience &lt; that is only 2 months, but...&gt; the items you get from the mobs you can group and kill are not as good as what you have already purchased.  <P>I say make the items equal to the mob and make them no drop.  who cares about how many of any item are in the game if they can not be sold.  ther would be no profit in some one camping an item forever just for the loot.  make the drops all lvl relative, ie you can not bring your lvl 5 friend in with invis and diamond skin to loot that no drop item that you have to be lvl 20 - 35 to get.  because it is just not there for someone not in the lvl range.<P>&lt;shrugs&gt;  logistically unrealistic ideas<BR>way to much recoding to do but, it would work, to make the game more interesting and more fun.  as when you wanted X item it did not take days of going to the place and finding it camped by people that do not even get exp for killing the mob (<P><BR>Runteater<BR>20 Troll Shaman<BR>

"I don't see why Everquest dungeons can't work the same way. There's no reason (except for the few one-way doors) that you have to be able to fight the whole dungeon in one sitting, or even one level. "<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;So long as we have static spawns with static loot it will be camping.  Random spawns with random loot would normally enourage a killing frenzy with the players HOWEVER, Verant has built in 'downtime'.<P>Simple math makes it so that people cannot do a dungeon.  Downtime of say 6 min, that means you can do three battles (or maybe just three things or so) till the dungeon respawns - not to mention the wide variety of level ranges in the same dungeon (as Muse said).<P>Not great design - they took the easy way out.  New world slightly better (static spawns with random loot)...

I did read thru the posts here, however there is one thing I'm not clear on, and that is exactly what Verant considers the proper way to play the game.<P>My main characters are a lvl 25 druid and a lvl 24 ranger.  I started with the ranger but now mainly play the druid.  I probably played the ranger in the manner Verant deems appropriate, and I have played the druid by camping first the Orcs in EC, the Dervs in WC the Orcs in HH, the Aviaks in SK and now the Gnolls in SK in groups.  I find the game quite difficult and frustrating, and if I play in any other manner than described I end up losing levels and experience.<P>I understand that tweeking a game is a careful process and overall I think that most things about EQ are pretty well designed as far as classes, roleplaying, fighting, etc go.  I am after all extremely addicted to the game.  I think there are quite a few things wrong with the game in frame rate, cursor control, typing, transaction management, etc. but thats another story.  I don't propose any major changes in gaming, though I suspect that more variation in the spawn places and spawn times for coveted mobs would help.<P>One other thing I notice between my early ranger and later druid is I am loath to spend the time to develop any trade skills.  I have found that side of the game to be mind-numbingly boring, unprofitable financially, lacking as a source of pride, a waste of time compared to killing things, and hard on both my carpals and the tunnels they run thru.

A ranger who can't make his own arrows from time to time is a complete waste of time IMHO. Also, who's gonna make that Trueshot longbow for you to use?? Or did you want to actually pay someone else to actually make it for you...<P>As far as camping for items and experience, I think that everyone has done this from time to time, but the main problem arises when people COMPETE for the same camping spot. <P>This is where the problems lie in camping, is that people would rather be selfish and take the camp (or the experience and loot that come with it) for themselves rather than sharing. This can be especially frustrating when it is a high level who is farming items from enemies that they don't get exp for. I can't tell you how many times I have hunted wisps (for exp and loot)to find the occasional Level 20 character killing wisps simply because they are in financial difficulties. <P>The solution to this that I always apply is to let the selfish person have at the camp, wish them luck while secretly cursing them to a speedy death at the hand of a creature that is more of a challange to them. <P>I also have my own little trick to play on them which I advise all Rogues (and classes that have invisibility available to them) to give a try... First make a quick disappearing act then Do an */emote ruffles through your pocket.*, followed immediately by */emote steals 10pp and 7gp from you!!*... hehehe   <IMG SRC="http://www.eqatlas.com/ubb/smile.gif">  Most of the time they get so furious that they will run off looking for you... leaving the camp unattended (even the high levels fall for this  <IMG SRC="http://www.eqatlas.com/ubb/smile.gif"> ) I have them  on hot buttons to so that they go off fast... This is sometimes too fun...<P>Blackivar ruffles through your pocket..<BR>Blackivar steals 9pp and 6gp from you!!<BR> <IMG SRC="http://www.eqatlas.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P><P>------------------<BR>Blackivar the Cunning<BR>Halfling Rogue<BR>15th Season<BR>Druzzil Ro Server

I want to be able to "do" a dungeon. I want to be able to explore new areas and lands. The only way to do these things is to level up to an appropiate level. The only efficient way, I've found, to level up is to camp. I don't like camping, alot of people don't. Camping is unrealistic and boring. With my first character I camped very little. It took me two months to reach level 7. I started a new one and with moderate camping I've reached level 8 in two weeks. Thats a big difference. There should be more balance. If I ever want to see Lady Vox, any of the planes, or even just another continent I'm going to have to do alot of camping. Why does there seem to be no alterative? I'm told there are 270,000 subscribers each paying $10 a month. With those kind of resources they should be able to figure something out.<BR>   On the EQ board I made a suggestion having to do with buffing quests in  a limited fashion. (follow Muse's link to Gordan's full post, if you have the interest, it's at the bottom) <BR>   Everquest is a great game with potential to be alot more. I pay my money gladly. But if/when I find another game that provides the same kind of fun without required camping I'll switch. I think I'll have plenty of company...   <BR>

Something someone said triggered this thought.  I was thinking how they want us to do stuff the preferred way.  But every time I do do that, I wind up getting killed the first couple of times.  Verant has responded to this issue by stating that every area has a learning curve, and is therefore more dangerous until you learn it, and therefore you are simply experiencing what they expect.<P>I believe in that concept in theory, however I don't think that in practice in EQ it is a really valid excuse for why I have to die in a new area.  A valid reason for dying in a new area is that I didn't realize that these monsters had lots of healers, or that there is a pit trap in the hallway, or that all the monsters are resistant to my spells.  The reasons in EQ that I die are more often things like pathing bugs, popping monsters, monsters aggroing from nearby rooms that I didn't know about, etc.  Yes, there is a learning curve, but it's a learning curve that has nothing to do with my character and monsters, but instead with game issues that have always existed.  In my opinion, balancing a game with bugs isn't "balancing."<P>------------------<BR>Muse<BR>Bard and Cartographer

"We cannot enhance this, because that would, trust us on this one, actually decrease your fun. "<P>Hog wash, please dont put words into my mouth. Camping sucks and continues to suck.<BR>However look who has decent gear in game and most of these people are campers. The ones that truely play the game as intended, Lack Good Gear for there lvls (ignore twinks). So where is the fun in playing the game in crappy gear.  I am currently lvl 51 one and I have a hard time seeing where all the fun is.  So please do what u must to add some life/FUN into the game. <P>Example increase rare outside spawns by 10% to 20%. Increase coin drop 10% to 30% so maybe some of us non campers can actually afford gear worth our lvl. Not all of us have 4 plus hours a day to invest  in this Game.<BR>So please make the rewards more fairer to all then just a few.

I still think the best way to cut camping would be to have a level cap on who can attack a mob similar to whats in place on some of the dragons. The biggest problem with camping is the number of people simply farming for friends, guild or alternate characters. A guy in my old guild bragged about him and a friend getting 12 black tomes in a row when they were short of cash. You can guarantee no one else was getting a chance at that drop.<BR>To be fair though if you had a level cap you would have to work it in reverse as well so that low level green mobs wouldn't suicide attack you like they do at moment. Case in point, I know a high level monk who has been attacked while sitting who didn't even realise because he automatically riposted and killed the with one hit. <BR>The stupidity of green mobs has always bothered me in this game, it's like a player saying "ooh look a red mob, thats at least 10 levels higher than me, I'd better go poke it!"

I had actually spoke about green mobs attacking sitting people on the EQ Boards and their response was "The green mobs attack sitting creatures because sitting increases your aggro range to all mobs, and they view a sitting player as vulnerable..."<P>Camping is something that people just have to deal with because in order to stop camping Verant would have to either drastically change the game mechanics (which they are unable/unwilling to do because of the programs limitations) or find a way to enforce a 'no camping' rule that would only cause more problems/frustrations. I do like the group quest suggestions, and also believe that rare item 'farming' should be controlled (possibly by a level cap or making the drops only occur for specific levels/classes).<P>I disagree though that you have to camp to get items/loot or that if you don't camp you get crappy gear... I am constantly moving around the continent when I am solo, because it beats sitting to recover health, and I have some decent stuff and pp in the bank... I'd rather travel/explore while the damn health recovers than sit being bored... <P>When grouped up however you are almost required to set up 'a camp' to pull towards because having a bunch of people wandering around leads to the group becoming seperated, which in turns leads to wasted time re-grouping... Casters need to sit to recover mana, so setting up a 'camp' is inevitable. This does not mean however that you should constantly stay in one place, or hunt the same things... I formed a group in W Commonlands one time where we hunted wisps until our group was full, then went and hit the Derv camp in that zone for a bit (2 spawns max), moved to the E Commanlands ruins and smashed some undead, then went to N Ro and took out another Derv camp, and then ended in Oasis killing orcs and then crocs...  <P>As far as Muse's comments about pathing and other bugs removing the fun from the game, I have to agree, but it could also be considered in this way (smile, have fun  <IMG SRC="http://www.eqatlas.com/ubb/smile.gif"> anyway ): Pathing problems arise from the monsters being less intelligent than players; Popping monsters could have been hiding or using the natural camoflauge of the landscape; Monsters on different floors might actually hear the echo of the battle (or noisy armor boots ringing on the floor) from a distance in a dungeon... hehehe  All depends on how you look at it....   <IMG SRC="http://www.eqatlas.com/ubb/biggrin.gif"><P><BR><P>------------------<BR>Blackivar the Cunning<BR>Halfling Rogue<BR>15th Season<BR>Druzzil Ro Server

Just a quick response to something someone said earlier. They stated that as a customer they should be more valuable to Verant because they only spend 6-10 hours a week playing as opposed to the people spending 60 hours a week playing, because they use less resources.<P>The alternative Verant could use if they wanted to is something Online RPGs in the past have done. They could always charge hourly. I remember playing Gemstone on Genie back in 94 when we had to pay 3.95 an hour to play the game. Just imagine what Everquest would be like if Verant charged even .99 an hour to play. It might seem to most people like "Oh, well now it will be balanced since people will only be able to play so much." But it brings in again another imbalance. If I make $65,000 a year and you are a kid in high school with a $20 a week allowance, won't it be unfair to you because you can't afford to pay what I can, thus taking RL issues and having them affect in game?<P>No way around it folks, no matter what Verant does they will adversely affect someone. By changing nothing they are merely protecting themselves. I can't say I agree with them, but I can understand why they do (or dont do) the things they do.<P>------------------<BR>Malex Diabhal<BR>51st Magician of Rodcet Nife

funny thing about a lot of these posts is that the ones who are the most infavor of VIs position seem to be kinda low level...its simple really, a dungeon like lguk, sol b, you cant realistically do because of the lvl disparity in MOBS, extremely low risk vs reward, spawn times, agro range, pathing....THAT is one of the main reasons people camp those places

OK you hl people here is an idea from a newbie with TONS of old school D&D backgroud.  I hate camping.  To level you must do it.  I want to be able to do dungeons later in my life.  Here is an idea to stop the camping.  All creatures should remember their killers when they respawn.  If your 70% of the way into the dungeons and decide to camp there for the repeat loot, low and behold 40 or 50 mobs come knocking at your door with revenge on their mind.  Any character that stays within a given area for a certain amount of time could trigger this.  It would be so incredably annoying to fight off all the mobs that continuing to do the dungeon would be the only way to play it.  Also VI would obviously have to make doable dungeons also for this to happen.  As in the old days the green mobs would be on the first few levels, then work your way down to the red ones.  Then a boss type creature could be a few levels higher.  With this setup even very high level characters could not camp the "boss" creature for fear of the first 100 mobs they killed coming for them.  Even all green 100 vs 6 the way EQ is setup would make it advantege monster.  After the final kill and looting a one way dimentional door/lift/spell/ whatever could take you out.  Let me know what everyone thinks.<P>Azmodeous, cleric of 14th rank Xegony server.

First off let me state that I am  newbie.  I have no char above lvl 22, 5-6 in the mid-upper teens.  Reason for this was I wanted to check out each class before I decided to devote my major time to one char.  That said I offer the following:<P>I watched a person sit at the camp right outside surefall glade(can't remember their names off hand).  This person sat there from level 16-17 until like 25-26 or so.  10 or more lvels worth of killing the same TWO mobs.  Now once this same person goes to another area at his current level of 29-30 some would expect him to have an idea what he is doing.  I know I would.  BUT how can this person know ANYTHING of fighting in a group IN a dungeon?  They can't possibly know anything of the way to fight like that.  They know how to solo and dot and run around in circles til it is dead.  Not much room for running around in the dungeons really.  My exp has been gotten by doin the newbie area, goin off to blackborrow, where I might add I learned to fight in a dungeon within a group, then on to NRO and oasis and finally into high hold pass on the orcs and gnolls.  I walked into high hold pass the other night and had 4 players ask if I wanted to join their group simply because I sortta knew what I was doin and would rather die making sure they are safely through the zoneing from a bad spawn then running for my own life and not caring if they lived or died.  Camping is a NESSARY evil in this game. VI can NOT make stuff drop every single time a monster spawns.  The balance of the game would be so lopsided that within a VERY short period everyone would be so powerful they would begin to hate the game simply because there is no more challenge.  Sure add more areas that have bigger and stronger monsters but you have to add more bigger and badder eq too, which by the way is dropping every spawn and thus the increase of player power is so rapid that well you get the idea.  <P>I do like the idea that once you have gotten an item that you can no longer go after it again.  Problem with that idea is they'd just get it for their friends or guild.  Personally I feel FARMING is what should be stopped.  Many spots are camped by farmers nothing more.  These are the ones who are ruining it for others.  Someone mentioned the 12 tomes in a row,  WTF is that for other then to 1. sell them, 2 give to friends/guildmates.  If the farming can be stopped I think alot less complaints would be forth coming on camping.  <P>Just some tidbits from a newbie who only has 2 months on the game.<P><P>------------------<BR>Ohlim Spiderstomper<BR>Ogre Warrior of Povar<BR>Way of the Wolf
