[B]Hmm, where to begin...

I have been involved in playing AC since the second (I think) beta test.  Just to clarify, there actually are classes in AC, but since it is a skill-based game, being a member of a "class" means that you can purchase certain skills with less cost and other skills are much more expensive.  Although this generally means that people will tend to improve in the areas that belong to their class, if they really feel the need to add some aspect of another class, they can do so, although at typically quite a cost.  The character I enjoyed the most, for example, was a Fighter, but at first level I ditched a bunch of his starting skills (like 3 or 4 various weapon skills) and added the Item Enchantment skill (whatever it's called) to buff his weapons.  This didn't work out so well, because his stats that determined mana were so low he could cast maybe two spells before being out.  Later on, since healing became a problem, when I got enough skill points I added Healing, which allows you to use healing kits on yourself to heal up.  Very useful...

You are correct in the fact that AC has many problems, but I think that they do well in dealing with the public.  That was the point of my statement.  Every patch that came out had corrections that, in my opinion, accurately reflected the problems that people were complaining about on the boards.  If something someone suggested made sense (and not in the sense of the "Vision" but common sense) and allowed people to have more fun, it pretty much found its way into the game.  There were not constant bicker battles on the boards, none of them are nicknamed "Whineplay."

AC turned me off mostly because all of my friends were addicted to EQ and because I felt like more of a unique person in EQ, where I had a race and a defined class.  If AC had been as visually compelling a game in terms of both environments and characters as EQ, the title at the top of this page would be AC Atlas.  I understand AC.

I played AC since beta.  I recently changed from AC to EQ and found EQ to be a superior game for my own reasons.  Some like AC more, other like EQ.  What upsets me is when they attempt to compare the 2 games without playing both of them or having correct information.  My beef was the topic on the front page of EQatlas where he states that he is happy that EQ is going to finally stop messing with classes in the nea future.  He also stated that people don't complain in AC because the don't mess with the classes.  This statement is misleading and I am a little annoyed by it.  For those that don't play AC, there are no classes to mess with.  You have a totally customizable character.  Any class can have melee or magic.  ANY class can have anything they want as long as they have enough points.  If they don't have enough points they level and save those points until they have enough to get a skill.  So, you see there are no classes.  Every class is multiclassed.  (BTW, this may sound cool but in the end it's not.. but that's my opinion).  It just really annoys me that people express opinions about a game they obviously don't understand.  AC has had so many problems that they drove many players away just like EQ.  People think AC people are more happy, but that is because 200,000 less people play AC than EQ so its just less people bitching but the percentage is the same.. believe me.  I could give 1000 examples on why I left AC but I'm over it.  EQ is fun to me and a better game in my opinion.  Before expressing opinions please show that you have some knowledge of a game that is just as flawed (more actually) as any other MMORPG.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Muse</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Hmm, where to begin...<P>I have been involved in playing AC since the second (I think) beta test.
