The Journey Begins Anew… <P>“Seems easy enough… I’m not THAT out of practice.” Juglar thought to himself. There were five of them, all stout lads, and all tipsy from the many flagons of ale they had been drinking throughout the night. <P>It had been a relatively slow night in the pub all in all. Juglar and his nephew, Injuree, who had just been recently ordained a Priest in the Church of Brell Serilis, had gone out to celebrate over a few pitchers of Tumpy’s finest brew. Only when Injuree had gotten up to get another round and had been accosted by the five younger dwarves, all recent additions to the Storm Guard, had things gotten interesting. <P>“Now Jug,” said an obviously worried Tumpy, “don’t be bouncing them boys too hard. They’re all good lads, if only a tad too young to know who you are.” The five dwarves looked at Tumpy, then back at Juglar, then at each other. “He’s just some old fool that doesn’t know when to back down to a member of the Storm Guard!” the biggest of the five said, “Now sit back down before we’re forced to show you what a real warrior of Kaladim can do!” <P>A smile slowly spread across the face of Juglar. “Come then, boys, and show me what a real warrior can do…” was all he said in reply as he stood up and removed his tunic. <P>He may have gotten a little older, but after he had come home to Kaladim, Juglar had started up a smithing business and had just recently become partners with old Everhot himself. The constant pounding of a smithy hammer day in and day out, had kept him in excellent shape, and actually, he was stronger than he had ever been. His chest was as thick as any brew barrel in the pub’s cellar, and covered with iron hard muscle. He flexed his neck with an audible ‘crack’, smiled, and waved the young dwarves to him. <P>The first two came at him in a rush, obviously hoping to take him down quickly and relying on their youth and speed to surprise him. Instantly, Juglar turned to the side, bringing his anvil like fists down upon each of the now airborne dwarves as they flew past him, hammering them down into the floor. Each of them let out a heavy grunt as they hit the floor unconscious. “Well lads… there’s three of you left… who’s next?” Juglar said through gritted teeth. It had been so long since he had been in a fight, and the need to pummel his next opponent had nearly taken control of his ability to hold back. As it were, he had to resist the urge to snap the necks of the two incapacitated dwarves that lay at his feet. <P>Before the remaining dwarves could decide what to do, the door to the pub flew open, and in streamed a dozen members of the Storm Guard, weapons drawn, eyes darting back and forth looking for something… or someone. <P>Their collective gaze settled upon Juglar. He sighed. <P>“Sir,” said Guard Kaldolar, “if you wouldn’t mind so much, we need you to accompany us to the gates of the city. You have a… “Visitor.” <P>Juglar smiled. With a whole troop of Storm Guard sent to escort him to greet this “Visitor”, it could only mean one thing. They were obviously afraid of whomever it was waiting for him outside the city gates. Juglar knew of only one person who would put so much fear into the hearts of such battle tested warriors, and that person just happened to be Juglar’s best friend. <P>“Guard… I will gladly accompany you.” said Juglar. “And fear not, for if this ‘visitor’ had come to harm you, or anyone with in our grand city… you would not be alive to be telling me that he is here. He is being polite in letting you see him. He did not have to.” <P>At this, the guard blanched. He knew of Juglar Veign, even if it were only from tales his father had told him. About the dwarven warrior who had become blood brothers with a troll. He had heard the stories, and knew what Juglar spoke of what the troll could do to be truth. <P>Juglar pulled on his tunic, finished his ale, and motioned for his nephew to follow him. It was about time that his nephew met the person he had heard so much about over many a flagon of ale. Juglar smiled to himself at how nervous his nephew looked as they walked out of the pub and towards the city gates. <P>It was a nice day out, and Juglar had to shield his eyes while they adjusted to the sun. Living within a mountain had its advantages, but as was always his calling, being out in the wilds truly made him feel complete. <P>The whole of the Storm Guard was present, and much to his surprise, the King was there as well. Juglar smiled and counted himself fortunate that his people had such King as Kazon Stormhammer. He knew his people would be frightened, and had gone to greet the possible threat to his people and city personally. Juglar knew Kazon was aware of what his friend was capable of, and showed no fear in greeting him. True bravery indeed. <P>“Hail, my vertically challenged brother!” a gravelly voice boomed from out in the middle of the field. Juglar couldn’t help but let out a riotous laugh as he approached his friend who was standing next to a jet black steed with red eyes. <P>“Bashy, my overweight green skinned buffoon of a friend, how are you?” Juglar said as he clasped hands with the troll. Bashy smiled, his razor sharp teeth showing, and lifted Juglar off the ground in a near bone crushing hug. The ring of steel as blades were being drawn rang out in the warm summer air. Bashy set Juglar down, and smiled again, unafraid of the nearly four hundred armed dwarves. All Juglar could do was laugh again. <P>“No need for that, my brothers of the Guard. This is Bashy Nator, and he comes in peace. He is like unto a brother to me, and I to him. You will treat him with the respect and honor that he deserves.” Juglar announced. “Anyone who does otherwise, shall answer to Me.”, he added. There was no mistaking the malice in his voice and all of the dwarves nodded silently in agreement. <P>“Well met, Brother Juglar!” King Stormhammer said from the front of the mass of Storm Guard warriors. “We shall greet this blood brother of yours as if he were one of our own! Welcome, Sir Bashy Nator of Grobb, from this day forth, you are free to come and go from our grand city as you will!” <P>At this, Bashy bowed to the King of the Kaladim. He turned to his steed, and with a wave of his hand, it disappeared into a mass of black smoke. He then turned to Juglar. <P>“We need to talk, brother. It’s important” was all he said. <P>Juglar sighed. He knew that his time living the life of a blacksmith was over. He was needed elsewhere, and if his good friend had come all this way to talk to him in person instead of using the Antonican Bards to deliver a letter, the need was dire indeed. <P>“Come friend,” Juglar said, “we shall continue our talk in my home while I gather my traveling supplies. I’m willing to bet a certain druid will be showing up shortly to whisk us both away?” <P>“Yes. Time is short and grows shorter still. There is a new threat to our world, and if we are to survive, we must meet this threat with all that we have.” , replied Bashy. <P>Juglar looked at his friend for a moment. He could only imagine what horrors his friend had seen that had shaken him so. They had been through much together, and to see his friend like this sent a chill through his spine. He patted his friends forearm, and led him into the city to prepare for the journey that lay ahead<P>--------------------<P>Brothers in life... brothers in arms... brothers in death... so shall it be.
