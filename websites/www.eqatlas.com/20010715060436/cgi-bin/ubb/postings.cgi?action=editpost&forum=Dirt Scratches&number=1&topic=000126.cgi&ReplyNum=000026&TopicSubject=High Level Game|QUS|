<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">I must say that Gordon does and doesn't have a point. While I don't have a high level character I can definitely see where the game would get stale if Verant didn't mix things up for them. I also see that there is a ton of stale material already out there for the hordes of newbies. But I think his point was that there is that ton of material for the newbies. So much in fact that things shouldn't get stale too quickly.
I share a PC with three other guys and the four of us take turns playing our characters. Two of the guys are total muttonheads who are mostly concerned with leveling for the sake of leveling. They hang out in EC for hours just trying to trade their way into wealth and twinkdom. Not surprisingly these guys are constantly griping about the product that Verant has produced (for all the same reasons given in this thread already).
The other guy I share with has five different characters and he keeps the game fresh by rotating who he's gonna play. I am slowly watching him get bored with the game, though, because as his characters reach 20ish they are twinked well enough that leveling isn't all that it's cracked up to be and with five newbies he's seen a lot of the various MOBs and is tired of them. However, he has a serious video game addiction and therefore fresh or stale he'll keep EQing.
I currently have one character and I have found one good way to keep the game fresh is to roleplay. I have a female troll warrior who prays to Cazic-Thule. She won't group with paladins, avoids clerics and druids where possible, and only tolerates other magic users. She isn't concerned with raising faction with non-evil cities, as a matter of fact she rather likes having to hide in the Freeport underground. She walks around muttering prayers, boasting of her beauty, and insulting the smaller races (i.e. all non-trolls, non-ogres). This all leads to quite a bit of entertainment for me. She's currently level 13 so she has a hard time finding good aligned MOBs to kill (the halflings in Nektulous are rather choice still though) so she wanders the countryside bashing what there is... a couple of crocs, a couple of orcs, a duel here and there... it's not about leveling with my troll. I try to play her to the hilt as well. She tanks to the death, she picks fights with things she shouldn't, and she scoffs when people cry for help. She's dumb and evil and therefore very fun to play. Personally, I find there to be tons of stuff for me to do in EQ, even while limited in my travels due to my evil nature.
Finally, one sure fire way to add fun to the game is to quit looking at the spoiler sites. The game was so scary, fun, and awesome when my first character (a halfling rogue) first ventured into the woods. I didn't understand the concepts of zones. I was always lost. I had no clue what to buy with my few coins. It was the best time I've had on EQ. To this end, I now try to travel without the use of maps (although I know some a little too well already). I don't look up prices or weapon stats. And I don't like to read posts about where and what to fight at what level. The game is reverting back to the same level of fun and awe that I had as a newbie and for those of you that have lost this feeling and find the game stale because of lack of content you should really consider a new pasttime. Please quit griping to Verant about how bored you are and just move on. You make it better for me, you save yourself money, and you can find out what other true garbage is on the software store's shelves.</TEXTAREA>
