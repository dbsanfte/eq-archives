      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      <p>Permafrost Keep is an ancient ice giant castle that has fallen into ruin, 
        buried in the glaciers that are slowly claiming the northlands. Most of 
        the ancient castle lies in ruins, and what is left consists of rediscovered 
        areas of the old castle and a warren of caves dug out by the goblins who 
        owe fealty to the great dragon Lady Vox. Ice Giants still live here, trapped 
        deep beneath in the cold, waiting in attendance on their master.
      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>angers </h3>
      <p>Permafrost Keep is similar to other goblin dungeons in that there are 
        always a large number of goblins either standing or wandering around anyplace 
        that you are. This makes it a very challenging, some would say impossible, 
        area to solo in, although there are certainly a couple of places where 
        soloing is possible. Most adventuring within requires a group so that 
        you can survive the constant onslaught of the goblins, many of whom are 
        casters and can see through invisibility. 
      <p>It should be noted that one of the two dragons on Antonica resides in 
        the depths of Permafrost. Lady Vox herself holds court deep within this 
        dungeon. She is guarded by Ice Giants who attend to her, and who are highly 
        aggressive. Her lair is also protected by pit traps, which can drop you 
        into a dangerous underground area filled with dire wolves, polar bears, 
        and icy terrors. Do not attempt to take Lady Vox or the Ice Giant Castle 
        by yourself or even in a small group, to kill Vox requires the coordinated 
        efforts of several well-balanced groups. There is also (disgustingly) 
        usually a server-wide list for who gets to attack Vox when she spawns.
      <h3><font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>
      <p>This zone, despite being far off in the north, actually does get some 
        travellers from afar, seeking out the goods that lie within it. There 
        are many rare items that are highly prized elsewhere in Norrath that can 
        only be found here.
      <p>Lady Vox herself typically draws the most attention these days, as the 
        players become more and more powerful. Although she herself is godlike 
        in power, the items that she typically drops are equal to the risk, and 
        many guilds and groups vie for the chance to fight her.
      <p>There are a couple of specific areas that are relatively safe to hunt 
        in for large periods of time. One is the Flag Room, named such because 
        of the flag hanging on an ancient pole in the middle of the room. A group 
        of the appropriate level can stay up against the wall and pull from the 
        flag room and the room beyond for quite some time. This requires a powerful 
        and well-coordinated group, however, as you can accidentally pull as many 
        as five spellcasting goblins at once.
      <p>It is also possible to solo relatively safely in two areas, one in the 
        area of the Goblin Alchemist, and you can often find rangers from afar 
        in this room waiting for him to appear. The other area is the King's Room, 
        where a brave person can sit along the front wall and pull the spawns 
        carefully.
      <h3><font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
        <font size=+2>P</font>ermafrost <font size=+2>K</font>eep</h3>
      <p>There is only one way in and out of Permafrost Keep, through the tunnels 
        leading in from the ancient castle ruins along the eastern border of Everfrost. 
        There are, however, two ways to get to the tunnels. If you pass directly 
        through the castle, you have found the shortest way, but also the most 
        dangerous, as there are usually several ice giants in that tunnel standing 
        guard. The other route lies through a small tunnel that can be found nearby 
        along the northern wall of Everfrost. This winds its way through ancient 
        tunnels and eventually into the main exit, past the guards through a secret 
        door. Through this way, Permafrost Keep can be safely entered.
