      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      <p>High Keep is the seat of a former empire that used to spread its power 
        over central Antonica in years past. Now, their reign has diminished under 
        constant attacks by the orcs and gnolls, and is restricted to High Pass 
        Hold now. However, the inhabitants of High Keep thrive on trade, both 
        legal and illegal, passing through the center of the continent, as High 
        Pass Hold is one of the few &quot;safe&quot; regions to pass through.
      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>angers </h3>
      <p>There are three specific dangers in High Keep. The first are the pickclaw 
        goblins, who exist in the basement of the Keep, apparently unbeknownst 
        to the guards walking above their heads. These spawn in a serious of rooms, 
        and become more dangerous the lower down in the basement one goes. They 
        are uniformly very heavily camped.
      <p>The other two are in the basement as well. There are prisoners that appear 
        to be safely tucked away inside of their prison cells. These prisoners 
        are highly aggressive and will come out of their cell in order to attack 
        you, regardless of how beneath you they are in level. If you get more 
        than one or two on you, they can be more than a nuisance, and the guards 
        will not attack them. Also, nearby is a Princess Lenia, not to be confused 
        with the Princess Lenya that is part of a quest. This particular princess 
        is a necromancer and around 20th level, so be careful around her (although 
        she is not aggressive).
      <h3><font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>
      <p>This is a small, tight zone to hunt in. You can make your wealth downstairs 
        with the goblins and walk a very short distance and sell or put it into 
        the bank, you can be bound right here, etc. It's a one-stop hunting place. 
        Probably for this reason, the poor Pickclaw Goblins have an estimated 
        lifespan far less than a mayfly, and the area has actually developed lists 
        for getting to attack specific pickclaws. Hmm, now I'm not so sure this 
        is a benefit...
      <p>The area also provides a good place for adventurers in the center of 
        the continent in general. You can be bound either in High Keep or in Highpass 
        Hold, and with the nearby merchants and bank, this area acts as much as 
        a town as either Qeynos or Freeport do, although I believe it is underutilized.
      <h3><font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
        <font size=+2>H</font>igh <font size=+2>K</font>eep</h3>
      <p>High Keep's entrance is located in the middle of Highpass Hold, on it's 
        eastern edge. From there the Keep can be reached through either Eastern 
        Plains of Karana (through a long gorge) or from Kithicor Forest.
