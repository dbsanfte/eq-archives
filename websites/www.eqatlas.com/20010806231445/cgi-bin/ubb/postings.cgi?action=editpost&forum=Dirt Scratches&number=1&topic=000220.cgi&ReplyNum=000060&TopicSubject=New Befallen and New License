<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">I do agree with the previous statement about most of the complaints about the "new" Befallen coming from people who got spanked there, but I feel they're legitimate.

I'm a level 20 bard on Morell-Thule, and as of 7am EST on July 21st, we're still cursed with the "new" Befallen. I wasn't even aware of the change until I decided I needed a weapon upgrade. I'm getting to the point in the game now where even the untwinked people (such as myself) have some nice equipment, yet I don't have the cash to go blow a ton of money on a Crystallized Longsword or anything like that, so I go over to Allakhazam's site and start looking through a list of 1hs weapons a bard can use in his off hand, and trying to get an idea of what the price would be (even though ALL the online pricing guides are severely overinflated), and that's when my jaw hit the floor: people still sell BA longswords (a 10/29 weapon) for 200pp on my server, a Crystallized Longsword goes for 500, a gleaming shortsword goes for about 1k, but here, in Befallen - the place I always camped as a newbie with my cleric but never had the guts to try and solo the second floor, I see a level 20 mob that drops a nifty NODROP weapon called the Servant's Blade -- an 11/30 1hs weapon that can go in the off hand.

Immediately I log on and decide to harass my guild members into coming to help me take this mob, since, given Befallen's proneness to trains, I figured there was no way I was solling a white-con toe-to-toe. However, it's the middle of the night, and the only person on in my guild is a level 24 druid. She agrees to help me, and I figure that Befallen should be pretty easy with a 20 and a 24. She ports back to WC and we meet at the entrance and zone in. Man, was I wrong...

Upon zoning in, I'm already down a bubble of life and my druid companion a bubble and a half as these green-con female dark elves I've never even seen before, swarm us. I think there were 6, but I don't really remember. We both wonder what the hell's going on, and she sits to med while I twist my mana/healing songs. WIthin about 30 seconds, a ghoul spawns literally right on top of me (we were sitting right at the zone line), and starts attacking. So I take out my weapons, twist warsong and melodic binding, and beat it down like the worthless piece of trash it is. Then I takea  look around the corner: there seems to be a big fight going on in the back part of the main room on the first floor - nukes, dots, lifetaps, even mage pets. I do a /who and there's only 3 people in here: myself, my groupmate, and a level 53 warrior.

By the time my groupmate finishing medding and we get back there, there's just a whole lot of undead corpses, and it turned out the warrior had the key. My companion said she had a servant of t'yval on track (what I was really looking for was a servant of lanys tyval, but figured it was close enough and maybe there was just a mixup on the website), and it was on the other side of the door. SO we followed the warrior through, but as soon as he opened it, we were swarmed. I don't mean like overpull, oops I brought an extra 2 mobs with me swarmed, I mean like 10, 15 mobs just appeared and started attacking. 

Now, all the fireworks from a minute ago made sense as these skeletons procded to dot me, nuke me, sick their pets on me, melee me, etc. All were green, most were casters, 1 had a mage pet (earth). They put up one helluva fight, but it seemed that for every one we killed, another suddenly aggroed. The warrior refused to even ackowledge us as we screamed for help, being overrun by hoardes of greenies.

Finally, I managed to get a song off (lullaby) and mezzed pretty much the whole crowd. My druid friend got away, but I was still rooted from the damned earth pet that was on me, so I beat the crap out of the pet, took out it's master, the root broke, and I ran like hell, finally zoning out with 6 hp left.

Needless to say, I didn't get my sword.

Now as for my feelings on the "new" Befallen? It SUCKS! It's just like the warrens... it seems as if it would've taken too much time to put any real thought into it, so they just pack it full of EXTREMELY aggressive, social weaklings, so that anyone capable of surviving the onslaught of greens upon entering gains absolutely no experience, and anyone that would gain experience has no way of surviving the swarm. It's just really bad level design... and I want my freaking sword.

I really hope it changes back soon</TEXTAREA>
