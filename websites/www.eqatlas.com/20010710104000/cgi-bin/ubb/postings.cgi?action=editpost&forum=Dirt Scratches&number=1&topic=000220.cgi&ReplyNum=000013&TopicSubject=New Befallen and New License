<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">     I had four hours to play today and spent it in Runnyeye trying to upgrade some of my armor that should have been five levels ago.  I wanted to post before I went back in regards to the changes that I have seen so far.  Aside from the suicidal mobs (which may be explained some way within the story line) I think it's a good thing.  The draw of EQ to me is that it is a team oriented game.  The changes don't seem to be excluding lower level players, but creating a reason for them to group and learn to work well together.  Clerics should be in high demand here now, and for the pre 20 set, I say that's a good thing.  Perhaps there will be fewer lvl 32 Rangers or Bards in the game who need to be walked through making an assist key by a Chanter in a month or two.  From what I saw, people who are levels 10-20 are not excluded from playing here, they will just need to learn how to work together to do so.  To me, that's what dungeon crawling is all about.  

My only concern is that they may have made drops lower down that are worth farming.  That will be the death of Befallen long before forcing groups will be.  The 30+ set will come and look around, and should.  Checking out changes and learning new story lines makes the game fresh, even in a place that is too low for getting xp.  If the loot is too good though, it will become a farm, and the players who should be here in the long run will find better places to hunt.  The speedy spawn times make me think that this may be a new experiment in co-existence however.  Farmers may be patient and lethal, but can they keep up with the spawn times?  Experience for the level of players the dungeon was designed for hand in hand with the drops the farmers want?  We'll find out soon enough if this is the case, but it's just a vague idea on my part.  I've never seens spawns this fast anywhere, which makes me think that something is up.

This reminds me of when they changed Unrest in the Runnyeye patch.  Everyone tried to play as they had been playing before for a couple of days, and many of us died in countless nasty trains.  Everyone eventually adjusted, and grouped accordingly.  There are more druids there then ever doing their part to help drive down the price of Pally equipment, but the trains of the first two days are part of the myth of the place now, rather than a problem of the present.  I assume that people who make Befallen home for a few levels will adapt as well, and will do so in ways that will help them in groups later in the game.
