[B]I to found in dismay the new mobs in the North Karana at to young of an age for my friend an 18th warrior and I a Ranger of the 19th had set out to find our homeland of Quenos. Forth we were in high hopes of defeaing a few of the trecheras bandits for our reward of there sashes. Forth our run together was short lived when we ran acrost this threat that was Mr.Thunderhead and his gang(he earned the Mr. soon after we found his camp when he and his gang set forth to dismember me and my friend we ran hard and fast but to no avail the spells that were casted on my friend soon turned fatiel in seconds as she died in the end of there camp and I ran still hard and fast but to my amazment they dident follow me even thou they attacked me. So to my amazment I stoped comunicated telepathicly to my friend that I would retrive her corpse and drag it to the zone line of the hills. I prayed to Karana to sroud my sight with camo I tracked her corpse and was able to pull it out of there camp from under there noses. As I draged her corpse she came into the zone and I tracked her down and retrned her belongings and vowed our revenge would come one day. 
 On my 30th season I had nearly forgoten about this camp but they dident forget me forth they set out to kill me hitting me hard and fast but I made my excape only to find out that the devil himself was with them hitting me with the spell scrouge before I could get away. I fought hard and long to servive but to no avail I faltered and was laid down to death at the zone line of North Karana.
 Yet to this day my revenge hasent come but soon I will strike back!!

One was a Wandering spirit looked like a Wisp but casts and hits alot harder was green but gave xp at 35 no loot.  Then i wsa up in the mountains by Bandit camp in north west and saw a new name so i tracked it.  Never saw what hit me, I was blinded and 20 25 sec later i wsa dead. I went back and there is 4 new people there a Human caster named Maglar red to 35 and three others Thurgen Thunderhead, Alzeker Kerda, and Nenika Lightfoot all green but hit in the 30 to 50's range and casts.  I think the Mag is a Necro and the others are Shadow Knights.  Me and a 38 Necro tried to harmony and kill just Maglar.  Pull was fine and we threw 2000dmg in dots on him and Necros pet hitting him.  Barely scratched him.  SO im guessin his hp is 20000 plus.  I'm tryin to get a couple of groups together to try him again today. On a side note they are indifferent to Necro's but do not respond to Hails.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">ohlim</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Ya know some of these new NPCs might the ones required to start/give the new class specific weapon quests.
