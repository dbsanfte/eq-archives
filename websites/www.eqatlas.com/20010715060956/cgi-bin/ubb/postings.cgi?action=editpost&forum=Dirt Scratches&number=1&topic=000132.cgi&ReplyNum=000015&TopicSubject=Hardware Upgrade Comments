<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">Hey Muse, 

I'm not a big poster to the boards but this is a thread that I'll weigh in on. I’m going to try to discuss the general topic first and then jump in with my own opinions at the end. 

There are a slew of issues that software developers must wrestle with as they try to determine the minimum spec for a product. To name a couple, there are the marketers who want to make the spec as low as possible so they can sell to as big a percentage of the market as possible. You have the developers who want to have the bar as high as possible so they can put in all the neat bells and whistles. Ad to that the testing team who tries to figure out where the bar can reasonably be set. From my years in the testing field, I would have to say that the end result normally works out with the marketers setting a minimum spec below what is useable and the recommended system requirements is what the testers determined to be the minimum acceptable configuration. (Thus if you only hit the recommended spec, consider upgrading your system or not getting that software) 

For most game products in the past, this was the entirety of the battle. Once the product was shipped, that was it. Online games like EQ have changed the way this works. Software is no longer static content. Part of the package is regular patches.

One of the big issues that I’m sure Verant was contending with is when they changed the engine from DX 5.3 to DX 7.0a is that the published system requirements on the Basic box for EQ are now wrong. The minimum spec that people committed to having when they purchased the game and entered a contract with Verant is no longer what they are getting.  From the standpoint of a consumer this is not a good practice. If I purchase a piece of software for a computer, and it works with that computer, I have a reasonable expectation that that software will continue to perform at the same level of performance with that system. 

That said, lets look at some of the other factors here, Within the next year there are several new MMRPG’s slated to launch that have outstanding cutting edge graphics and will begin to erode the existing EQ player base as well as suck up many of the new gamers entering the MMRPG market. 

Additionally the old engine was starting to have trouble with compatibility on what is now pretty common technology this was causing an increasing amount of grief for an increasing number of players (As a SBLive user I’m one). Rather than offering up more bubble gum and bailing wire solutions, Verant bit the bullet and decided to go with the upgrade to code that is more compatible with today’s devices. 

This will loose some customers for them, but the niche of the computer market that is “Gamer” tends to be people who are on the fast track of upgrading. In my personal observations I would say most Gamers will upgrade at least part if not all of their system every two years or less. Non Gamer  users, (web surfer, office apps etc) tend to hang on to the same system for 3-5 years sometimes longer. 

So that’s the thumbnail of the dilemma.  We all know the direction Vernat is going. I think its reasonable for the most part. If I ran the zoo this is what I would do:

I would put together a small team to do maintenance on the existing code base which Verant says is almost ready to be frozen (apart from content). I would devote the rest of my Dev resources to creating a new, state of the art engine. Use the same world, but all new character models, motion patterns etc, make the game as “kick but” as they can, put it on par with Halo, UO2, and some of the other eye popping games out there. Rather than keep adding servers to the existing EQ, start adding servers for the EQ2, allow server splits, to let the cutting edge customers migrate to the new software, but retain their characters (on a server basis, just like with the current splits) A system like this will help extend the life of Norath by years, without necessarily shutting out players with older systems into the cold. 

This is just an idea, a flawed one at that. I could detail a dozen problems with it. But I won’t, it would add nothing to the basic thread, which is, is it fair to require players to upgrade their systems to keep playing the game. There is a kernel of a solution to the upgrade path problem in the above idea, this is why I present it. 
I apologize if this post is too long. I hope it sheds a little light into what some of the conversations at Verant may have been leading up to the recent change.
