      <h3> <font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      The Oasis of Marr is a large desert area that lies in the middle of the 
      Desert of Ro. The oasis itself is inhabited by crocodiles of all types, 
      and the island in the middle has a temple that is surrounded by spectres. 
      The zone is one of the most dangerous in this part of the world. 
      <h3> <font size=+2>D</font>angers</h3>
      This is a very dangerous zone, mostly because almost every creature in the 
      zone is both powerful and aggressive. The pumas are the least of your concerns, 
      the wandering madmen, mummies, and sand giants are much more dangerous. 
      Add to that the fact that many lower level characters travel through here 
      en route from Freeport or Neriak to the swamps to the south. 
      <p>To travel through this zone, the safest route (from north to south) is 
        to travel along the eastern edge of the zone, along the water. The crocodiles 
        along here are not aggressive, and you can travel most of the edge without 
        being attacked. The only concern in this area is that, quite often, players 
        from the lake tower will pull spectres to the zone and the ghastly creature 
        will wind up slowly floating down the shore, destroying those they meet. 
        Keep your shout channel open to hear the warnings. The southern edge is 
        by far the most dangerous. Sand giants travel a path back and forth along 
        the southern edge. Desert madmen roam this area and are far more powerful 
        than you can tell by /con'ing them. Use the tops of the sand dunes to 
        watch the surrounding creatures and their movements, and move quickly 
        to the zone edge. Don't fight anything in the middle of the desert, because 
        sand giants will attack you if you are not next to the edge. 
      <h3> <font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>
      This area is good hunting for people who are looking to fight creatures 
      of the levels described above. The crocodiles and caimans along the eastern 
      edge provide good hunting for characters in their low teens for level, and 
      the southern edge has a large number of giants and mummies traveling through 
      it. 
      <p>There is also something of an economy here. There is a gypsy camp near 
        the lake that sells combine weapons as well as other more average equipment. 
        The Inn at the southern edge of the lake, although in a very dangerous 
        spot, also sells items (although at a very inflated price). 
      <h3> <font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
        <font size=+2>O</font>asis of <font size=+2>M</font>arr</h3>
      <p>The Oasis of Marr can be reached from the north along a large border 
        it shares with the Northern Desert of Ro. Along the southern edge there 
        is a small range of mountains, but there is a narrow pass in the middle 
        of the southern edge of the oasis through which travelers can pass into 
        the Southern Desert of Ro. </p>
