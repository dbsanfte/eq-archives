      <h3> <font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      The Oasis of Marr is a large desert area that lies in the middle of the 
      Desert of Ro. The oasis itself is inhabited by crocodiles of all types, 
      and the island in the middle has a temple that is surrounded by spectres. 
      The zone is one of the most dangerous in this part of the world. 
      <h3> <font size=+2>D</font>angers</h3>
      <p>This is a very dangerous zone, mostly because almost every creature in 
        the zone is both powerful and aggressive. The pumas are the least of your 
        concerns, the wandering madmen, mummies, and sand giants are much more 
        dangerous. Add to that the fact that many lower level characters travel 
        through here en route from Freeport or Neriak to the swamps to the south. 
        Two noteworthy creatures are Cazel, who is a very high level sand giant 
        that appears now and then, and is generally unkillable even by the groups 
        hunting sand giants here. He can leave reams of bodies stacked on the 
        shore. The other is the dry bone skeleton, or &quot;DBS,&quot; who wanders 
        over the entire zone. These creatures are also in the high teens and are 
        aggressive and tough to take down. They are also not too easily seen against 
        the sand of the area, and sometimes can be confused for some necromancer's 
        pet. </p>
      <p>There are some special notes to hunting orcs here that you should be 
        aware of. Anyone hunting the &quot;Orc Highway&quot; should be hunting 
        in a group. The reason is that there is always a large number of orcs 
        slowly wandering around the area. Even the best and most awake puller 
        is going to, at some point, pull more than intended and you're going to 
        wind up fighting a swarm of them. The orc priests are truly evil, and 
        should be taken out first as they will heal themselves and others during 
        battle. Also be aware that there is a slight naming difference between 
        &quot;an orc warrior&quot; and &quot;a orc warrior.&quot; The &quot;an&quot; 
        orcs are in their mid-teens in level, while the &quot;a&quot; orc is more 
        like 20th. This means that, especially for lower level groups, you must 
        /con as you go to make sure you're not pulling a big baddie.</p>
      <p>To travel through this zone, the safest route (from north to south) is 
        to travel along the eastern edge of the zone, along the water. The crocodiles 
        along here are not aggressive, and you can travel most of the edge without 
        being attacked. The only concern in this area is that, quite often, players 
        from the lake tower will pull spectres to the zone and the ghastly creature 
        will wind up slowly floating down the shore, destroying those they meet. 
        Keep your shout channel open to hear the warnings. The southern edge is 
        by far the most dangerous, as there is a slightly higher concentration 
        of powerful creatures and the dunes make it hard to see them as you make 
        your way to zone. Desert madmen roam this area and are far more powerful 
        than you can tell by /con'ing them. Use the tops of the sand dunes to 
        watch the surrounding creatures and their movements, and move quickly 
        to the zone edge. Don't fight anything in the middle of the desert, because 
        you'll get swarmed. 
      <h3> <font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>
      This area is good hunting for people who are looking to fight creatures 
      of the levels described above. The crocodiles and caimans along the eastern 
      edge provide good hunting for characters in their low teens for level and 
      their older cousins the deepwaters can carry you all the way up to around 
      20th. If you're savvy, you can also get a regular supply of them from the 
      water, although your swimming skill must be pretty good to actually make 
      it back to shore. There is also the &quot;Orc Highway&quot; that provides 
      some good training for grouping, as well as good loot and experience, and 
      actually extends along the entire western edge of the zone and not just 
      at the most packed area on the NW corner of the lake.. Higher levels can 
      pull the spectres from the main island as well as hunt sand giants here. 
      <p>There is also something of an economy here. There is a gypsy camp near 
        the lake that sells combine weapons as well as other more average equipment. 
        The Inn at the southern edge of the lake, although in a very dangerous 
        spot, also sells items (although at a very inflated price). 
      <h3> <font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
        <font size=+2>O</font>asis of <font size=+2>M</font>arr</h3>
      <p>The Oasis of Marr can be reached from the north along a large border 
        it shares with the Northern Desert of Ro. Along the southern edge there 
        is a small range of mountains, but there is a narrow pass in the middle 
        of the southern edge of the oasis through which travelers can pass into 
        the Southern Desert of Ro. </p>
      <p>The dock has boats that lead to the continent of Kunark.</p>
