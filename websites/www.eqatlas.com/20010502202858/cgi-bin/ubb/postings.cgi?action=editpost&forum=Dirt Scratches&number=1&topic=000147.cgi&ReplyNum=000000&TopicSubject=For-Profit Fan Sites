<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">Hail!

Here is a repost of the comments I made on my front page.  Comment as you feel...

I have been thinking recently about the concept of for-profit fan sites.  This has been on my mind largely because of the closing down of several of the ad networks that fueled these sites, and I've been wondering what the future of these sites is both economically and from a gamer's standpoint.

Now, I'll be the first to admit that EQ Atlas is a for-profit website.  If it had not been for-profit, I frankly would have quit a while ago (probably after Antonica had been mapped), and would have simply played the game for fun.  I'm not sure how a lot of other people who have similar jobs to what I have feel, but running one of these sites (at least a good, up-to-date one) is hard work for a hobby.

Could these sites exist if they were purely done by enthusiasts?  In the past year-and-a-half, I've seen many great sites come and go, run by enthusiasts, but not for long (Relentless Monks, the Dojo, the Shaman's Crucible, to name a few that I recall).  They last as long as their owner's have enthusiasm for the game, and die after that.  This is fine for short-term games like Diablo 2 or Baldur's Gate, but for games that last years and years, it doesn't work.

It doesn't take long to see what the result of this is.  Many of the major sites have all started to look the same in terms of content.  Allakhazam's has been the prototype along with Everlore, Caster's Realm and a few others have been making great strides to keep up.  The news sites (Stratics, Vault, etc) are pretty much identical, although if you know them well there are significant editorial differences.  It happens like in all business that you see everywhere today, gather enough stuff together to please everyone, and everyone will be pleased (or at least that's the theory).  

I'm not sure how I feel about this.  On the one hand, these sites are incredibly useful to play this game.  I use a couple of them all the time.  On the other hand, I have not found better information on specific subjects than I have on some enthusiast sites (like EQ Necro or Relentless Monks) that the big sites simply can't replicate.

I think that if there is to be a future for gaming web sites, that the enthusiasts have to keep doing them.  I think that the internet advertising is going to keep taking hits and that a lot of the big boys will fall, their profits not worth their expenses.  For enthusiasts, however, the profits are not measured in dollars, and through them we will all be receiving help for years.  I just hope it waits til I pay off my med school loans...
