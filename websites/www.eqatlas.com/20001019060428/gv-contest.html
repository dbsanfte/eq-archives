        <p>Enter the contest to win a new Game Voice device!</p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>Your level 50 Dark Elf just got PK'd by a backstabbing Rogue! Have 
            you ever wanted to tell your opponent what you really thought of his 
            tactics? Well, here's your chance to do it in real-time! The SideWinder 
            Game Voice allows you to communicate within games (over the Internet 
            or LAN) and to take advantage of voice activation of game commands 
            via a stereo headset connected to an eight-button control unit. You 
            can also choose between broadcasting your voice to the entire group 
            or directing your communications to private team channels. Game Voice 
            software makes finding and connecting with your friends quick and 
            easy, due to the integrated buddy list based on Microsoft Messenger 
            Service technology. While online or off, you can take advantage of 
            Game Voice's voice command functionality. You only need press a button 
            and then speak commands such as "attack," "conjure," "teleport," or 
            "heal" to respond swiftly and intuitively to any situation you might 
            find yourself in during gameplay.</p>
          <p>For more information on this device and to download a free, limited-feature 
            chat-only version called Game Voice Share go to:</p>
          <p><a href="http://www.gamevoice.com">http://www.gamevoice.com/</a></p>
          <p>Since Game Voice requires at least two players, Game Voice Share 
            means you can always talk with teammates and opponents alike, regardless 
            if they have the full retail version. The downloadable Game Voice 
            Share is a limited-feature, software-only version of the full retail 
            product, and it requires the user to have a microphone and speakers 
            -- or preferably a headset -- in order to use it. Game Voice Share 
            is free for unlimited use.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The contest is open to all people who register with my <b><a href="http://www.eqatlas.com/cgi-bin/ubb/Ultimate.cgi?action=intro">Forums</a></b> 
          section over the next few weeks time (exact end date at this time uncertain). 
          Two Game Voice devices will be given away. I will draw two random names 
          from the list of people that have registered in my Forums and contact 
          them via the email address they provided to get all the information 
          required for delivery. The delivery method will be one of my choosing 
          at the time of delivery. If you have any questions, please contact me.</p>
