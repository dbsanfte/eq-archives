<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by ChaoticDescent:
[B]hello.
I'll admit I'm very inexperienced about EQ.
I played it for about a week while on vacation and got hooked, and have played it for the past week since I bought my own copy.
sorry for the long post. I'm asking a number of questions, but you can ignore the later ones.

I'm now a level 10 wood elf druid.
unfortunately I neglected the advice that I always hear to practice all my weapons to max them out. no my H2H, 2H blunt, and 1H slashing are all almost 0.
I managed to get my 1H slash up to I think 22 or something, but it's really painful.

are my buffs slowing or stopping me from raising skills in offence/that weapon, and defence? I noticed my offence and defence weren't maxed out and I'm wondering how I do that. I've died quite a bit, (about a dozen times each level I go up) so EXP VS skills should be in favour of my skills.  ;)

is it true that lower level monsters will not raise your combat skills as fast? it sure seems that way.

EXP in groups. no one online seems to have it right.  :) if you don't do damage, you often don't get EXP. am I right, or is it coincidence that the monster was not high enough level?
is it really only about the level range of the group? get someone red to another member and the lower level won't get anything?

I'd also like a bit of advice. I haven't too successfully joined groups. I read articles on what makes good groups, but it still doesn't seem clear enough to me. I try to do my part to heal party memebers, take the pressure off someone who's getting beaten (especially magic users)
but maybe I'm just not finding professional enough parties. looting never seems to be organized. we tried alphabetical, and rolling for CB orc shoulderpads, but no one could keep track. in the end basically I think I get belts, which is easier than carrying weapons to sell, or money.

I'm also always low on mana. (at least I have med finally) and I can't do this "kiting" I hear about. the spell is resisted, and then what do you do when two orcs are smacking you around and you can't cast? duke it out if I have my mace on and they aren't both 1 level lower, or zone / run to the guards. :P I don't understand how it's "unbeatable" strategy. why a 25% EXP reduction is necessary. I med while he's rooted, he'll break out and smack me while I'm undefended. is that good strategy?

I also spend most of my savings (had 100pp, spent 80, back up to almost 60 now) on blacksmithing in freeport, up to only level 68. (whatever laterns are trivial at, I beleive) should I have looked for someone to cast charisma buffs, or a super expensive item to raise my cha? (no, not the Japanese tea)
I had found out that anything better than indifferent wouldn't change prices, but charisma up to 104 would. mine's 75. although I did notice race plays a part, since the wood elf in west freeport gave me better prices, but I wasn't about to zone twice each time I filled up on lanterns, just to not lose so much. (I DID sell them back though, rather than destroying them)

and as for equipment... I've basically just been accepting it when slightly higher level characters give me stuff. but looking at equipment lists online gives me no idea what i should be looking for next. even searching by class.[/B][/QUOTE]
