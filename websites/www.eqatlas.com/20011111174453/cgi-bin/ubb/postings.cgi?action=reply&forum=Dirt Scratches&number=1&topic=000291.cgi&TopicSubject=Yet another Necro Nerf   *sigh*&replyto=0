<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by Naz2421:
[B]This article, although written by a high level necromancer is intended for newbies and above, pls take a moment to read these grave facts about our class.

I have been travelling norath for over 2 years now, and have played nearly all class. I was drawn to necromancers after seeing what I believed to be was "demigod" status of high level necros running around with some nice spells and decent pets.

Do not be mis-led, after aquiring such spells as dmf, and a hard hitting pet, I realised we have bneen severly nerfed to the point where we are no longer viable in a group. beyond level 50 it is no longer viable for us to solo either, which makes us one of the weakest classes in the game. 

I know that is a harsh comment, The necromancer is my favourite class, and its dis heartning to see what we have become.

You may ask now, what about your pet and your high level/high damge spells? The real answer is, our pets cant do alot of damage at higher levels, our greatest spells are nearly always resisted, and frankly, no one wants to group with a necro, we are exp leeches, in a high level group, and that is the plain truth - especially in a dungeon.

Shadows Of Luclin here to save the day?

Will we become more viable in a group, or as a solo package?

At first glance the new SOL spells seem somewhat a much needed break for the necro, since we were nerfed by over 40%

I have taken many hours of thought into the nature of the new spells, and have cime to a conclusion of various new spells on offer.

Mind wrack - mana tap, cost 600, taps 50 to each player in group - 50+ spell
I question the viability of using this spell, At 600 mana u are transfering 50 mana to each member in your group. 

Now consider that most high level mobs have a seemingly endless supply of mana, the tap is useless.

Take into too account that you have most likely got 3 tanks in the group, you have 2 maybe 3 people in the group that can utilise that small mana hit.

you would be much better served casting covetous subversion at a cost of 300 mana which would give the two casters 100 mana each instead of 50.

*sigh*

Post 50 group ac tap

Ac tap for 18 is quite useless for a spell in such a high category, its a shame necro's have been nerfed, are not wanted in groups, and have severe trouble soloing at that level. *sigh*

But wait, what about our group life tap at level 60??

A small life tap, which is actually a leech spell, for those of you that dont already know this, classes such as the shaman or druid have regen spells that would far outwiegh the regen capabilities of this spell. and If you manage to make it to level 60, by then your only decent group based spell has come 30 levels too late.

perhaps if this spell arrived at level 44 or 49 and was in the form of an instant tap (not over a minute) groups would actually see the benefit of having you join them in a high level dungeon, where you may prove to be worth more than an exp leech.

Our other spells, some for undead (one decent 50% undead slow spell - which 3 other classes get anyway) are quite limited. 

We get a pet buff, that we already have at level 12, increases str/atk and speed, by a small amount. *Sigh* another wasted spell.

And folks, thats what we got, not alot of good news im affraid, looks like once the hype wears off that level 60 necro's get a weak group life tap, yes you guessed it, we will still be unwanted in groups, meanwhile, you still have all your high resists, weak pets and un soloable post 50 mobs, so where does that leave us??

We have no choice but to do something about it. I have spent years working on this charecter, and Im not about to give up on our class.

We are an evil class, we have many disadvantages, faction/low hps/high resist rate/limited vendors and banking to name a few.

I am going to do some more posting to get feedback in writted form, from my other circle of necro friends, to try and get us back to where we belong, a respected evil class, and if we cant group, then give us back our solo capability at post 50!

A friend and I (both necro's) originally joked about making a guild called the

 - Anti`nerf alliance -

we are on the tribual server, so if there are people out there that share the same cause to fight to get us a reasonable position in the everquest world, then u are most welcome to join, if I get enough feeback I will also build a web site.

email naz2421@excite.com

The guild will be based on the tribunal server.

Above all, let me re-enforce we are an evil race and class, our travels are somewhat harder to get through than good races.

We need to fit somewhere,

1. Either make us group viable, and I dont mean a small life or ac tap, which wont mean anything at post 50.

2. Or Bring us back to our status similar to before we were nerfed, That would mean a pet of higher level, or that hits harder (and I dont mean the power of the previous 49th pet, he was understandably over kill). Or re-implement the delay on the pets weapons so there is a differnce.

I hope I get some feeback on this, would be much appreciated, because come december, we are going to lose our position as a viable charecter.
