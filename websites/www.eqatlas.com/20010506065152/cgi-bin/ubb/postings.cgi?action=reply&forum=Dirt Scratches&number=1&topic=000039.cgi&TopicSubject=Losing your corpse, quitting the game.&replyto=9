If I lost my corpse in an area where I could not retrieve it myself, are there any options besides letting it rot.  Do necromancers have a spell that could summon my corpse to a certain "safe" area?  My corpse has been in this place for two days now, and if all of my stuff (I'm level 25) that I've accumulated while playing the game rots with it there is no doubt that I will cancel my account.  I really feel for people who die in the planes, because my situation isn't that bad in comparison.  All you EQ pros let me know what I can do.<P>Gyzzdark Brainbarsher<BR>Troll Basher of the 25th Circle<BR>Povar</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Morlak</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Ok what u can do is get a Bard to find your body, they have a song for that.  You can get someone to drag your corpse to the zone where it will easier to loot.  You can get a rez.  Ok your body will last 24hrs on-line  game time(real world time) and/or 7 days off-line. Or any combination of this ie <IMG SRC="http://www.eqatlas.com/ubb/tongue.gif">lay for 12hrs 3 and 1/2 days off-line.<BR>Hope this helps.<P>Morlak Perdido<BR>Level 46 Paladin <BR>Xegony</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Rylius</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">As Morlak says, you will probably need to Consent someone to drag your corpse to a safe place, but it has to still be in that same zone.<P>However, I'd like to add that before you delete your account, I'm sure you had some cool stuff on you, but really, it's just stuff.... your character is a bunch of cool skills, exp, friends, knowledge.... even if you didn't put lots of money in the bank (which I hope you did), how bad would it be to start from scratch at 25th lvl to get items. A friend of mine had to do it once, of course he did get help from guild mates... but then that is in some ways... what a guild is for.<P>I don't have anything great in the Bank, but if you are on Mith Marr and you lose all your stuff, send me a tell, I'll give you something...<BR><P>------------------<BR>Rylius Elfheart<BR>Paladin of Tunare, 25th Season<BR>Dragonhood of Marr<BR>Mith Marr Server</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">taobob</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">It actually depends where the corpse was lost too...<P>I lost a corpse at the bottom of the Ocean of Tears, and there was no way to get it, except to have the GMs invervene. They said that they could only drag the corpse to a random island in that zone, and they would not tell me where...<P>Needless to say I never did find that corpse... <P>Think I'm happier as this character anyway...<BR><P>------------------<BR>Blackivar the Cunning<BR>Halfling Rogue<BR>15th Season<BR>Druzzil Ro Server</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Synger</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Not 100% sure on the details but Necromancers do get a spell called Summon Corpse.  It is available to them at lvl 39 and the spell is kind of a rare drop, not bought.  It requires a coffin (100pp +) which I think can only be purchased in Neriak?  Anyways, when cast it basically summons your corpse to the feet of the necro who casts it.  Other than that if it is in an unreachable spot you can try to petition a GM. I've heard them going in for lava baths to get corpses...<P>If it's simply lost in the Karana's somewhere, look around for a bard or a necro. They both get spells early on that can simply point you in the right direction of your corpse.<P>And I wouldn't suggest deleting your account, as was said before...it's just stuff.  You don't lose any experience and that is certainly more difficult to get.<P>Hope this helps and good luck!!<P>------------------<BR>Synger<BR>&lt;The Wandering Minstrels&gt;<BR>Bard of the 50th missed note.<BR>Bristlebane</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Logan</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Coffin costs roughly 200pp.<BR>If the necro is above 35th lv they MIGHT have the spell.<BR>If you put in more details as to where your body was lost it might help people in giving you better answers.<BR>If losing your stuff at 25th lv would upset you enough to quit the game you may wish to consider quitting now.  The amount of stuff you've accumulated compaired to what you will (and the value of it) is nothing.  If you get that upset over stuff, quit now - save yourself the freaking out.  IMO.<P>Logan</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Wanderer</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">The summon corpse spell is a 39th level necro spell.  The bad thing is the we can not buy it.  It drops for the boss inside the dungeon of Paw.  I would not quit the game if you do not get your stuff back.  I have lost at least 2-3 bodies in different situations.  The above posts are correct, if you enjoy EQ and wish to keep playing, you wont be too long to get back on your feet.  Nothing wrong with taking a backstep once in a while.  Ppl would probly hook you up with banded armor at least and you could even use FS weapons if need be.  I played EQ since one month after release(connection problems or would have been same day) and people now adays are pretty spoiled when it comes to equipment.  I dont know how nice your stuff was but it can be replaced.  The core of your EQ game is the actual character.  If you can get to the zone you died in ppl are usually very nice about dragging unless its a very active dungeon.  Dont count out revive either,  you wont get exp,  but you will get your body back.  High level paladins can even cast this 49th + i think.  People who can locate corpses are Bard(song) and necromancers(spell). I think SK might get it too, but not sure again.  I dont play on Povar, or I would see what I could do.  Hopefully all turns out well.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Wanderer</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I forgot one more thing... type / who paladin all    /who necro all    /who bard all    this will list a short number of those players all over the world.  You can look for one in the zone with your body or close to the zone.  Give them tells asking to help you out or see if they can do a shout asking for help to give YOU the tells.  This is a great accept for information and getting help across the globe of Norrath.  I play a ranger so I know all too well about dying and being zones and zones away from where it happened.
