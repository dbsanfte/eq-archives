      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      <p>The Temple of Droga is a religious center for the goblins that have lived 
        in these mountains for centuries. The Temple area is a vast underground 
        complex connected to the Mines of Nurga.
      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>angers </h3>
      <p>The entrance to this dungeon from the Frontier Mountains is one of the 
        &quot;one way&quot; variety. There is a false floor in the entry room 
        where you will drop down a small distance, too far for you to jump or 
        levitate back out of. Once there, you need to travel some distance in 
        order to get back to the exit again. The other entrance into the zone 
        from Mines of Nurga is also one-way, and you have to drop off of a fairly 
        sizeable cliff to enter the Temple.
      <p>The rest of the Temple complex is notable because it is literally swarming 
        with goblins. Goblin Whipcrackers make frequent, fast patrols through 
        the halls. There are very few places that are safe from wandering or spawning 
        monsters, and therefore few areas to pull to or to rest and camp at. Most 
        of the time, an adventurer will have to take their chances and camp in 
        the middle of a hallway, and hope that when you come back in, there aren't 
        any goblins wandering by.
      <h3><font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>
      <p>Despite the fact that the Temple is covered with creatures and the good 
        pull points are few and far between, this area is manageable. First of 
        all, nothing in the dungeon can see through invisibility. This means that 
        you can travel wherever you want to in order to set up camp with relative 
        safety, although if your invis drops on you, you're going to have problems.
      <p>The other benefit is the large number of goblins. Although a specific 
        area may seem very crowded, usually they are spread out enough that you 
        can pull only a few of them at a time, and slowly clear the area out. 
        The fast spawn rate and large number of creatures can keep a good group 
        busy for hours.
      <h3><font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
        <font size=+2>T</font>emple Of <font size=+2>D</font>roga</h3>
      <p>There is one location on the surface in the Frontier Mountains that leads 
        to the Temple itself. It is located at approximately 3560, 2800. There 
        is also an entrance from the Mines of Nurga which you must fall down a 
        rather large cliff to enter the Temple. The exit to the Mines from the 
        Temple will also lead you to a one-way cliff. Exiting to the Frontier 
        Mountains means you enter the entrance hall and proceed out the door. 
        Stepping in the wrong place means you have a long walk to try it again.
