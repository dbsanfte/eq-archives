                February... 8) Given I only have 140 pages to hit, that's pretty 
                good. I thank you all, and hope you keep coming back for more 
                maps, cuz I'll keep making them.</p>

            <blockquote> 
              <p>I've been trying to map out Mistmoore (it will be up by the end 
                of the week), when there was a GM-run event on Bristlebane (haven't 
                heard about other servers yet). Overall it went well (I think 
                I'd say that). There were about 65 people in the zone on average, 
                although all in the courtyard, so it was a bit laggy, and the 
                monsters kept spawning and driving out the lower levels (I died 
                from some stupid trained ghastish ancille). The people watching 
                consisted of about 55 people who were sitting quietly watching, 
                8 people who insisted on catcalling and trying to insert themselves 
                into the event, and about 5 who decided to attack one of the participants. 
                Geniuses, obviously.</p>
              <p>Anyway, the players were none other than Mayong Mistmoore himself, 
                Lord Galendore (Mayong's servant), Khasra Vei'Ras (Mayong's &quot;lady 
                friend&quot;), and a wounded elf (who desperately needed a name). 
                The plot (and I admit here that I missed both the beginning and 
                had to leave before the end because it had lasted over an hour 
                and I had to leave), was that Mayong wanted information out of 
                the elf, perhaps a bardic letter that he was carrying. The elf 
                preferred to die, but Mayong didn't let him, although he beat 
                him up pretty good, and threatened to kill his family and also 
                to make him undead so he could torture him forever. Standard badass 
                dark elf vampire stuff, I suppose. That was pretty much the plot 
                for an hour, and I missed the end, so I don't know what became 
                of it. Oh, and in the middle the elf (stupidly) looked to the 
                surrounding crowd for help, which was the trigger for all the 
                morons to let loose. I left out the aftermath photos because I 
                think so many dead bodies in one place scares the little ones...</p>
              <p>As for the dirt on Mayong and how kickass he was... There were 
                a few 50th level Paladins there chomping at the bit to let him 
                have it, and I watched one get killed twice in a row in under 
                15 seconds. Ouch. One guy backstabbed him and got killed with 
                one 1200 hp spell with a casting time faster than my Snare. Ouch. 
                He group feared us a total of 3 times. Not so bad. He used this 
                funky blast spell that shot me flying up against the tower and 
                dispelled all of my spells (twice). Ouch. Needless to say, I think 
                Mayong got to sleep unscathed in his little tomb last night...</p>
              <p>I've put up two pics of the event, <a href="MMM1.html"><b>Mistmoore 
                Event Pic 1</b></a> and <a href="MMM2.html"><b>Mistmoore Event 
                Pic 2</b></a>, which show the players well.</p>
