        <h1>How to Survive "Da Swamp"</h1>
        <h3>by ROUQ da Troll and penned by Matt Lund</h3>
      </center>
      <p>ROUQ is a young Troll basher who has survived the low levels of Warrior-dom 
        and is just entering the teen levels. I am going to pass my knowledge 
        on to any aspiring Troll who is looking for some advice. 
      <p> First, some background. ROUQ is my first character ever on EverQuest, 
        and not "knowing" all the tricks, I acknowledge I may have made some mistakes 
        along the way. This is not a guide to Power Leveling, but rather the meandering 
        path ROUQ took. Hopefully, it will guide you in the right direction, and 
        lower your frustration level. Playing a Troll, whether for role-play or 
        straight power gaming, is not easy. 
      <p><b>RULE 1</b>: Trolls are big. This seems obvious, but I didn't really 
        understand how big until an elf showed up in the swamp for the first time. 
        He came up to my waist. This really changes how you see the world. Monsters 
        can hide between you legs and bite your ankles quite adeptly. Look down, 
        and around. If you have played another race, your prospective is quite 
        different. 
      <p><b>RULE 2</b>: Trolls are dumb. I don't mean "duh, ROUQ bash" thug type 
        dumb, that's role-play. I mean straight game numbers dumb. Huge effect. 
        I didn't know how much, until at level eight I started a Human wizard. 
        Try a massive reality shift. My wizard maxed out his skills within a bubble 
        or two every level. ROUQ still hasn't maxed out any secondary skills, 
        only one weapon, and two thirds of another. Pick a couple of skills that 
        you really want, and work 'em, because you are only going to get a couple. 
        Sad but true. 
      <p><b>RULE 3</b>: Trolls are tough. This is your main advantage so remember 
        it. They heal twice as fast as the other races, have infravision, and 
        are the second strongest and most endurable race. (Ogres are bigger in 
        both size and numbers) Regeneration cannot be under-valued. You heal 4 
        HP every 7 seconds when seated. This means you can out last any low-level 
        poison, and take on relative White monsters with ease. One memorable moment 
        ROUQ still carries is at level 4 and he got into a scrap with some lesser 
        Kobolds. (more later) ROUQ had some armour, and a short sword. ROUQ was 
        regenerating while fighting faster than the little dog boys could hurt 
        him, and there were three of them. When the fourth showed, ROUQ started 
        taking damage. 
      <p><b>SUMMARY</b>: I don't know how much of an XP hit the Trolls take, because 
        I haven't played any other race high enough yet, but I would guess that 
        they are close to base line; with their size and power balanced off against 
        being brain-dead and hated by most other races. Trolls are (in my opinion) 
        the best tanks around. Ogres are better pure fighters, but they are just 
        two big. You can get two trolls fighting in the same space as an Ogre. 
      <p><b>STARTING OFF</b>: When you make the decision to become a Troll it 
        means living in <a href="grobb.html">Grobb</a>, a tiny little town in 
        the far South. It's easy to navigate, and the map in your manual will 
        get you around just fine. As usual, you will have your guild note, so 
        use it. For warriors, your guild is Da Bashin' Place, and it should be 
        within sight as you start, just cross the bridge. Embarrassing as it is, 
        I fell in the water when I started, and it took me a while to get out. 
        Just find a straight bank, and look up, you'll do fine. Get your armour 
        and then you have to make training decisions. As a aspiring basher, I 
        would recommend not following the standard newbie path: put three skill 
        points into Sense Direction, and one into One-Hand Slash and Kick. Getting 
        lost sucks, and it is very easy to do in the swamp. This also goes back 
        to the dumb part. Learning intellect type skills is very hard for a Troll, 
        while killing off monsters is comparatively easy. A beginning Troll can 
        also kick, an awesome second attack, so use it. Head South out of the 
        city into Innothule Swamp. Your adventure is about to begin. 
      <p><b>THE SWAMP</b>: After you follow the tunnel into the swamp proper you 
        will see a duck-blind kinda thing, with a camp-fire and a Basher. Bashers 
        are good, so remember them because they are going to save your watertight 
        ass more than you figure. To the right (east) is another couple of Bashers, 
        and two the left (west) there are a couple more camps running up the shore. 
        The Innothule swamp is 90% water, and subject to Murphy's Law, which seems 
        to work everywhere, you will always die in the water, so try to avoid 
        this fate, as it makes finding the body so much harder. You should have 
        about 30 HP at this level, and what CONs white to you will actually be 
        more like a blue, so get bashing. 
      <p><b>THE PLAN</b>: Hey, what do you expect? You're a newbie. Kill snakes. 
        Sorry, no magic wand for the first few levels. Keep to the shores, with 
        a hill on your right or left, and remember to use sense direction ALWAYS. 
        Its tempting to chase after some monsters, into the swamp proper, but 
        I think this is a fools chase. Always keep the camp fires in visual range. 
        The critters in the Swamp very quite a bit so get into the habit of CON'ing 
        everything. Unlike, say, Qeynos, where the bats, rats, snakes, and decaying 
        skeletons are about it (not counting the bugs), the Swamp has some serious 
        Tombstones running about, and they come all the way South. OK, the bats, 
        rats, and snakes are standard. I think the snakes are the best money, 
        so you might as well beat on them if possible. However there are some 
        other critters that aren't too bad, and unique to the swamp. 
      <p><b>THE CRITTERS</b>: First off are the Lesser Kobolds. The dog boys are 
        really nice. They have the most cash money, which is good, and gang-pile, 
        which isn't. Watch out if they run, don't chase them, but back off towards 
        the Bashers in case they bring back too much for you to handle. When ROUQ 
        started, the Lesser Kobolds were the only ones of their type; now there 
        are Kobold Hunters too. These dogs are the pitbulls of the Swamp. Tombstone 
        to the newbie, so run like a dog they are, and don't bother looking back. 
        Swamp Crocs are pretty typical of their breed. Tough, deal big damage, 
        no loot, but good XP. CON them, and if you are ready, bash em. Bull Crocs 
        are a deep swamp breed that doesn't wander down too often. Like the Kobold 
        Hunters these bad-boys are Tombstone all the way, and unlike most lizards, 
        gang up. That's because they bodyguard a special croc called the Fat Croc. 
        This unique beast is an Ogre warrior quest, so don't sweat it. Fungus 
        Man Trackers are a Swamp denizen that will kill you now, but later you 
        will want to seek out. Good XP, and tasty when deep fried. The other race 
        that shares the Swamp are the Frogloks. These are the GEMS of the Swamp 
        and come in many breeds, in ascending order: Tads, Froglok, Fishermen, 
        Guards, Foragers. The last three have good loot in the form of Froglok 
        meat and cash, but all stun and will rock your world at lower levels, 
        so just avoid them for now. The Tads have Flesh, which sells for a bit, 
        but more importantly is also half of a Warrior quest that is fairly easy 
        to do, and gives big rewards. Ask level 5-7 trolls for a piece of Froglok 
        meat, and that and two pieces of Tad Flesh will get you a BIG ax and some 
        XP from the boss Basher. The real reason to hunt the Frogies though is 
        to get netted armour. Weightless, magic, awesome. Never buy armour. Save 
        your cash for weapons and special gear. As you get armour piece by piece 
        just keep slaping it on, and selling/trading the extra, soon you will 
        have a full suit of weightless armour, and not have spent a penny on it. 
        When the time came I was able to buy ring mail because I never bought 
        armour the whole way up. This magic armour is the best part of being a 
        troll. No other race has access to starting equipment that is this good. 
        Finally, keep an eye out for a skeleton with a weapon. Not only are they 
        easy kills with good cash but rusty short swords suck, so you want to 
        upgrade quickly, and following ROUQ's Frugal Troll Guide, you don't want 
        to spend real money on weapons at all, so steal them. 
      <p><b>FINAL NOTES</b>: Well, I hope this helps you. I enjoyed writing it, 
        so get out there and bash a lot, make rude noises, and offer to eat and 
        elf that shows up. Great fun. One thing I didn't mention, but may have 
        come out. I am cheep in my playing, I hate spending money I don't have 
        too. Free armour and weapons abound in the swamp, and while not great 
        don't cost you much. Fishing is the same thing. You have a lot of down-time 
        healing, so buy a pole and some bait and fish sitting down while you heal 
        up. Saves money for food and passes the time too. No other race lives 
        in the water, why not take advantage of it? 
      <p>Good luck all.
