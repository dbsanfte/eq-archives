      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      <p>Castle Mistmoore is the stronghold of the ancient dark elf vampire, Mayong 
        Mistmoore, and his throngs of followers. The castle itself has vast, mazelike 
        corridors and secret areas, hidden away from prying eyes.
      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>angers </h3>
      <p>Castle Mistmoore is filled from one end to the other with dark elves 
        in thrall of their lord and undead raised and controlled by him. Since 
        Mayong Mistmoore considers all to be his enemies, everyone who enters 
        here will be attacked viciously and relentlessly by his followers. Dark 
        elves and other creatures roam the castle during the day, and at night 
        the undead rise to roam the castle, replacing many of the daytime creatures. 
        Invisibility works on the daytime monsters, and invisibility vs. undead 
        only on the undead creatures.
      <p>This area is lethal for someone trying to solo, it simply is not possible. 
        The monsters here are so tough and spawn so quickly and close together, 
        that trying to pull one monster that you could gain experience from will 
        eventually result in your death. As such, everyone must hunt in groups 
        for safety in numbers.
      <p>The worst danger in this zone is the trains. The biggest reason for this 
        is that most of the trains come from areas farther in, like the castle 
        itself, and on the way out every creature along the way will join in. 
        All of these trains pass directly through the middle of the outer area 
        between the tower and the lake on their way to the narrow corridor to 
        the zone edge. The only ways to avoid these trains are to be either behind 
        the lake or the tower, or to zone. Also, the zone shuts down after a large 
        train since it is also lethal to pull from the line of returning monsters 
        as they walk slowly back to the castle. The pathing is such that they 
        run around a little, gathering friends before coming after you, invariably 
        pulling in friends. I have never entered Castle Mistmoore with fewer than 
        five bodies littering the entry hallway. These monsters will also hang 
        around the entrance for some time before walking back, so it's safer at 
        all times, if possible, to zone in invisible, because you never know who 
        you'll meet on the other side.
      <h3><font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>
      <p>Although dangerous, this zone is arguably some of the best experience 
        for any zone in the game, assuming you don't die frequently within. The 
        spawn rates are fast and creatures of similar strength tend to spawn very 
        near each other, so a group can pull a small area with good results without 
        encountering more than they can handle. Loot is also good, as the dark 
        elves often drop platinum, runes and words, and the gargoyles drop gargoyle 
        eyes which are worth at least several platinum each.
      <p>The other benefit of this zone is that nobody who hunts in the front 
        need die. This may be a bold statement, but if a group is smart, everyone 
        has Spirit of the Wolf on when hunting here, and whenever there is even 
        a question that you may have more than you can handle, whether from a 
        bad pull or some train, every person should simply zone. The zone edge 
        is very near and, if nobody tries to be a hero, nobody should die. Accidents 
        will happen, and deep castle trains can have monsters capable of dealing 
        out 500 or more hit points of damage with one spell, but overall it is 
        a safe place to hunt.

        <font size=+2>C</font>astle <font size=+2>M</font>istmoore</h3>
      <p>Castle Mistmoore is reached by travelling through Lesser Faydark to the 
        western edge of its southern border. An ancient druid ring stands at the 
        entrance leading into the zone. Most of Lesser Faydark can be travelled 
        safely by those who are powerful enough to fight in Mistmoore, but care 
        must be taken to avoid the Brownie camp to the north and the Shadowed 
        Men camp to the east. Dark elves that are quite powerful have taken up 
        residence in an abandoned camp along the southern edge now as well, so 
        do not run along the southern edge as a way of finding the tunnel to the 
        Castle.
