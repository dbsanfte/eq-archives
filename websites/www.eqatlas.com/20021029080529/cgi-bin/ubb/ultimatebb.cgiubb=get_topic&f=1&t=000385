I'm posting this here, since people get agitated if I post any commentary on the front page, plus here I can hear what other people have to say about it.<P>In case you haven't heard, SOE has announced a new Legends server.  What follows is the gist of what the Legends server consists of, which I grabbed from <A HREF="http://legends.everquest.station.sony.com" TARGET=_blank>http://legends.everquest.station.sony.com</A> :<P>1)  Costs $39.95/month<BR>2)  Personal homepage that is updated daily with your most recent stats/items.  You can also post things like desired items, stories, enemies and allies, etc.<BR>3)  An "exclusive server, with a limited population of players able to participate in a new, more dynamic world."  This involves quest and adventures run by GM's, as well as in-game customer support.  This also will involve Historical Quests where you interact with important figures in the world.<BR>4)  New Legendary items, which will show up on the Legends server first.  Some may even be named after the first person who finds them.<BR>5)  Calendar of events.<BR>6)  Interactive map that will show you where your characters are, where your guild members are, and where you've been with that character.<BR>7)  Tales of Adventure where the best stories by Legends players will be displayed.<BR>8)  Guild Halls (a guild website complete with calendar, message boards, etc).<BR>9)  Can move up to 8 characters from an account originally registered by you.<BR>10)  Signups occur on a first-come, first-serve basis starting February 4th (this monday) up to an initial cap of 8,000 people.  If someone gets your name before you do on that server, your name will have an x appended to it.<P>Well, that about sums up what the server has on it.  I guess the best way for me to comment on it will be to go through each bonus and discuss it, and then sum up at the end.<P>1)  Cost.  This is pretty pricey.  While I'm sure some people can pay it, it still seems like a lot.  It's 4x greater than what people on other servers will be paying, so they would be netting $320,000/month from this instead of the typical $80,000/month from regular servers (if we assume they all have 8,000 people on them).  Their hosting costs will be the same regardless, since it's still just one server, so that's a lot of extra cash to use on the following stuff.  Where does it go?  Let's see...<P>2)  Personal homepage.  I guess this might be useful if you needed to show other people what you had.  Given that you can't alt-tab out of the game, I'm not sure how useful this will really be (other than to pass the time at work).  It's also super cheap to run for Verant after the initial development, at absolute worst case (and you have no idea how much I'm fudging this number) maybe like $10k/month.  Realistically probably less than a quarter of that.  It's also stuff you can do on Allakhazam's site already.<P>3)  The dynamic server.  This one is, I'm sure, going to be the biggest sticking point with a lot of people, and I think it is with myself as well.  The game has, since it came out, been touted as not having enough dynamic content, which had always been promised.  That being said, the initial attempts at this didn't work out well because of problems both on SOE's side and on the player's side (like idiot players attacking the quest-giver and ruining the quest).  They also got swarmed because they were so rare, that they were truly one-of-a-kind events that you didn't want to miss.<P>The last dynamic event I personally saw was two Halloween's ago, when I got butchered during an event in Oasis of Marr by some ogre.  Before that there were changes now and then (like the nightly undead in Qeynos Hills) but those have pretty much stopped.  SOE claimed to have solved the problems with these dynamic quests (like they said they had made a way for NPC's to be unattackable).  So I wonder where all of the regular server's dynamic content is, which had been promised, half-delivered, supposedly fixed, and is now absent?  Apparently that costs too much to do.<P>Also, people had a lot of questions about the customer support and the phrasing of this.  "Does this mean that we, on the regular servers, don't have in-game CS?"  The statement is that they've been increasing their CS personnel in anticipation of this all along, and that the regular servers will not experience a drop in CS.  I'm not sure I believe that, since it seems that those CS people are probably working right now (unless they let themselves be hired with the promise of a job in 3 months), and will be swapped over when it goes live.  My personal hunch is that they need more CS people now overall, which isn't showing up too badly with the extra people from Legends filling in, and will become very apparent after they're gone.<P>That said, CS is definitely costly.  A well-paid CS guy might make $5k/month (note I'm totally making that number up, it could be way off).  With the extra $230,000/month, that's about 46 CS people.  I'm sure it's less than that, since they have a whole Legends "Live" team, but still a lot of bodies.<P>4)  New items.  Interesting.  In some ways this makes Legends a test server.  In some ways it takes away items that the regular servers could have had earlier.  We're all paying for development of new items (and the regular people have been paying that for a long time now) and now we have to wait even longer for the results of our payments to become available to us, so they can be given to people as a perk for paying more.  And not all the content will even make it to the regular servers.  This is kind of irritating to me.<P>5)  Calendar of events.  See #2 above.<P>6)  Interactive Map.  This has some interesting ideas to it, although again without a alt-tab, I'm not sure how useful it will be.  The interface is cool, though, maybe I'll steal it for here (j/k).  Might be good for planning raids later on with your guildmates.<P>7) & 8)  Stories & Guild Halls.  See #2 above.<P>9)  Move up to 8 characters.  Not much to say about this.  I do like that if you want to move them from a couple of different accounts, you have to consolidate them on one first (and pay that fee) and then move that account.<P>10)  Signups.  This is fine, although it may scare away some guilds who don't want to leave all their buddies behind if they sign up and their buddies don't make it.  I'm not sure how to get around this problem, unless they let you back out of it if you wanted to.<P>Overall, I'm not really in support of this new server idea, and I think it's a bad PR move on Verant's part.  I know what the thought is, that there are a group of people out there who are willing to pay more for something of this sort, and they're right, there are people out there to whom this would sound great.  I am not one of them.<P>The reality, I think, is different.<P>There will be a longer wait for new items/zones/quests, etc. on the regular servers.  Why?  It will all need to go through the Legends server first, or else the Legends people will complain (and rightly so, that's what they were promised).  And not all the new content is even expected to go on the regular servers.  I hope I'm not paying to develop for these servers...<P>There will never be any interactive quests/events on the regular servers.  Why?  As part of this change, they stated that those cost more money.  I think they will simply recommend that you move to the Legends server if that's important to you.<P>CS will suffer on the regular servers (note that I've never personally had a problem with CS, but many many people complain about this).  Why?  I mentioned above that I think they will be effectively shunting people to the new server.  The recent increases are probably required for the old servers but are, as they've stated, too expensive to maintain.<P>Last but not least, I think that this will be bad for PR.  There are a lot of people already disgruntled after Luclin, which had very stringent requirements, putting EQ as one of the hardest games to run (which it probably shouldn't be).  They're disgruntled that they paid for software that was so buggy out of the box.  They're disgruntled because they have a lot of outstanding issues with the basic game that never got addressed (like incomplete/buggy quests and simple bugs with the game).  I think the timing of this will make it look like SOE has its eyes on its wallet instead of its customers.  It should keep its eye on its customers, and not just the high-paying ones, but the much more numerous number that have paid and played for the past nearly 3 years to get it this far.<P>Anyway, that's my two cents.<P>------------------<BR>Muse<BR>Bard and Cartographer

At first I loved the idea... the graphics on the "character homepage" are beautiful and the idea that it could be done automatically extremely appealing (even though I do get most of my enjoyment out of "tracking" my characters instead of playing them and have generated many Word docs and Excel spreadsheets to transfer info from in-game to web sites without Alt-Tab).<P>Then I thought about it a bit... $40 a month is a lot of money... and it's only 8 characters... I have 18 characters and don't want to start new ones just for Legends, and the ones I'd most want to have Legends homepages for are guilded and not moving.<P>I'd be willing to pay $5 or $10 extra for the web pages (maps, homepage, events, guild tracking) on my normal server (for as many characters as I create, not limited to 8)... but I won't be joining Legends as it currently is.<P>And I agree about the events, items, and CS... doesn't bode well for the "live" servers.    <IMG SRC="http://www.eqatlas.com/ubb/frown.gif"><p>[This message has been edited by Evenstar (edited 02-09-2002).]

I agree with you completely Muse and I share with you my further thoughts on the subject. <BR>My first prediction: they will not get 8000 sign ups but they will get 2000, they will consider that not enough to continue the venture, thus having 2000 extremely disgruntled customers. Worse PR.<BR>Should that prediction not come to light, my second predicted scenario is this: a few groups of well seasoned veterans will go over to Legends for 3 months max, try to loot everything new and of value, then transfer back expecting to make a small fortune in game. Even more bad PR and bad interrelations between gamers within the so-called “economy” of the game. Which I think is horrible anyway and should depend more on trade skills.<BR>I started playing the game about 18 months ago and put it away when I was about 6 or 7 levels into it finding little interest in the social demands of grouping with 14-year-old boys. <BR>I picked the game back up in September of last year when both my children wanted to play with me and we have had a very good time doing this as a family. However, this means that I am already paying for 3 separate accounts, I have three machines which have all been upgraded to 512 ram and gforce 3 cards, not to mention the cost of the software itself for each account. <BR>This brings me to my even more personal issue on PR.<BR>I attended the Fan Faire in Dallas, not only coming early but paying for and bringing my daughter i.e.: hotel expenses, meals, and entry fees. We were both never so disappointed in all our lives. <BR>The only saving grace of the whole affair was meeting Keith Parkinson, purchasing several prints from him, and having him personally sign them. He is a very nice gentleman indeed.  <BR>Since I purchased my software so long ago, I have EQ and Kunark but at the time Velious did not exist. It seems to be only available now by purchasing the trilogy pack. <P>I personally asked Gordon in the bar of the hotel where I could get the expansion pack without having to buy even more software I already owned. I have already purchased two of the trilogy packs, three SOL expansions and the original EQ/kunark set. His response to me was that I would have to talk to someone in marketing. He did not so much as offer me a name, a phone number, or anything else to help me.  At that point, my respect for the staff wavered immensely and I realized that we, the gamers were not looked upon as real people, not even viewed as important clients, we were but sheep following the wolf to the cave. I am not alone in this thought, I have other professional friends that play and we have begun to compare notes, especially after the fan faire. They may continue to dupe the younger players out of their allowance money, but if they continue with PR the way it’s going, they will certainly loose those of us with the bankrolls to support them.

I personally am viewing EQ as a training experience (though I happen to enjoy it, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages so far) while I collect notes on my ideal MMORPG.  I may never see everything I want, but at least now I have a list of what I want so I can keep my eyes open for it.<P>I'm sure as time passes and the genre matures there will be many more (and better) options.  Mistakes made in the code that are nearly impossible to fix in this game will be avoided in the next generation.  I'm looking forward to seeing that.   <IMG SRC="smile.gif" border="0"><P>--------------------<P>Evenstar
