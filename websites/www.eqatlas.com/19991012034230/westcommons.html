<h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>

<p>The West Commonlands is a large open area that is the western continuation of East Commonlands.  This area is significantly higher level than East Commonlands, and many of the monsters here are both dangerous and aggressive.
<h3><font size=+2>D</font>angers </h3>

<p>This is an area, much like Northern and Eastern Karana, where many relatively low-level players travel through in order to go from Qeynos to Freeport.  It also has a large number of aggressive creatures that live in it, most notably the hill giants and kodiaks, but the undead and werewolves also fit the bill.
<p>Aside from the above, low-level characters (below 10th) shouldn't really be in this zone at all, and travellers should stick to the path and keep an eye out for wandering aggressive creatures.  The hill giants generally stick to the southern and western edges of the map, and the werewolves to the northwestern corner.
<h3><font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>

<p>This area is a good, solid, higher-level hunting area.  There are several camps that can be taken by groups of lower level characters, and most of the rest of the zone can provide good hunting for higher levels.  It is also a great area to hunt Will O' Wisps in, and they start at 9th level.
<p>There are also several quests that involve this region, and it is where the entrance to Befallen exists, quietly tucked away behind where the hill giants roam in the southern edge of the zone.

<p>West Commonlands is accessible from the west through the pass to Kithicor Forest in the northwest corner of the zone.  To the east, and Freeport and Faydwer beyond adventurers can pass into the East Commonlands.  In a narrow, dimly lit tunnel off the southern edge lies the front entrance to Befallen...
