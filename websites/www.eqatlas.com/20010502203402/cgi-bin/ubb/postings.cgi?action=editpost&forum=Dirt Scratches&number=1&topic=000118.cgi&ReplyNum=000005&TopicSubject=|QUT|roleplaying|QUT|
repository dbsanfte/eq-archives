<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">Is yrogerg really annoying? I gotta know. I enjoy him running around yelling and singing all the time, but I wonder if I am making a pest of myself. I realize he is always begging for high-level help because he got himself into a jam. Is shouting rude? It seemed to be the best way to  get up a group or find that help  i needed, but since passing tenth level, it seems I am annoying more players. I began to think of these annoying traits as part of his character; mostly they arose from not knowing a thing about the game and having to yell for help alla time, but now they are part of yrogerg. I wonder though, if its time he grew up and took more responsibility for his actions. I won't be insulted by honest replies, but please don't bash me. This is a huge learning experience. To all past group mates, thank you all, you have been wonderful friends. If I haven't looked up anyone, it's because I have been running all over the world just to see what was there. It's been great fun seeing the world, and everything is new and full of cool new stuff, and I love that part, but it also means i am often running blindly into a deadly mob, and then crying for help because i have no clue how to get out of the jam. Thanks heaps to all those who have come to my aid! I gotta tell you, the two most exciting experiences i had in EQ were sneaking into brownie central in lfay invised and quick getting ported out just before the little buggers got wind of me, and levitating and Sowed rushing into and out of xorbbs gorge while a 30+ level kept most of the muddites off my back. Even with his help, I still got blinded and whomped on, and flew sightless and clueless straight up, realizing when my sight returned that i was a hairs bredth from getting killed again. Both experiences were my own stupid fault, and both relied on my begging for help; neither got me any exp, (but I did recieve some nice gifts from my rescuers), but MAN, was I ever into the game when i was sweating it out! I hope i did not ramble too much there. Thank you all my group mates and saviours, you have meant the world to me. I mean the part about my shouting being annoying, i will temper that down, but elves love to laugh and sing and mine is very young yet. </TEXTAREA>
