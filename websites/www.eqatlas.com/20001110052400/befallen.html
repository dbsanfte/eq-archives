      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      <p>Befallen was once the site of a wonderful temple, a reclusive home for 
        the monks who maintained it. Many blame the dark elves for what it has 
        become, but whatever the cause, Befallen is now a home to the undead its 
        inhabitants used to hunt and destroy. Individuals who thrive on these 
        beings have also taken up residence in its halls, necromancers and shadow 
        knights. 
      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>angers </h3>
      <p>Befallen is a small dungeon filled to the brim with undead creatures 
        of all sorts. If that doesn't give you enough of a feel for the danger 
        here, I'll explain more. Trains and being swarmed here are the largest 
        danger to anyone adventuring into the halls. Most adventurers would describe 
        this place as difficult to adventure in without dying at least once, and 
        usually for one of the above reasons. 
      <p>First off, the trains can be atrocious. There is a very low level area 
        (the 1st floor) and a quite high level area (3rd floor). On the 3rd floor 
        (well, on any floor actually) it is very easy to be swarmed and overwhelmed, 
        and many people, if they don't die, will then be running for the exit. 
        This causes problems for the people who lie along their path. Many of 
        the monsters will jump off of the train and attack people that they pass 
        by, but even worse is what happens when the person that all the monsters 
        are chasing either zones or dies, and that is that the entire train walks 
        back down to its level again. Along the way, they will attack anyone within 
        their frenzy radius (which is almost the whole dungeon, it is so small). 
        The trains are also more deadly because, if you are fleeing them, you 
        have to somehow try and open locked doors from your inventory screen while 
        being slammed. 
      <p>As for the swarming, if you are able to walk in the front door and look 
        down into the main hall when it hasn't been cleared out in a while, you 
        will have a good idea of how this is readily possible. From your standpoint 
        at the top of the stairs, there are at least four skeletons within view. 
        Each of these skeletons is in attack trigger range of each other one, 
        so basically, if you are low enough level to get experience from killing 
        them, attacking one will bring all four onto you, which if you can get 
        experience from them, can be tough to handle. Needless to say, every single 
        room in the whole dungeon has essentially the same design, so either get 
        used to soloing greens and low blues, or get in a group. It's even worse 
        when you get jumped by creatures who spawn during your fight, so keep 
        your eyes peeled and your keys handy (in order to create the trains mentioned 
        above). 
      <p>Specific dangers... Mummies attack, and mummies cause rabies. If you 
        cannot cure disease, make sure you are friendly to someone who can (and 
        will). Sitting or, even worse, meditating, is a surefire way to get swarmed. 
        Basically, what happens is when you do either (or loot, incidentally) 
        you increase the attack radius for any creatures around you. In other 
        words, they will attack someone who is sitting down at a farther distance 
        than someone who is standing. Also, aggressive greens (everything here) 
        will attack when you sit, so if you sit down next to a decaying skeleton, 
        he will attack you. Very annoying and potentially dangerous depending 
        on your level. Necromancers are pure evil (no kidding, right?). They are 
        much more deadly than they /con to you, especially since the normal rules 
        of spellcasting that you and I follow do not apply to NPC casters (rules 
        like not casting while running, using mana, being interrupted, etc). They 
        tend to run early, so kill them fast and effectively. 
      <h3><font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>
      <p>Most people who come to hunt here are either looking for a specific item, 
        either quest or otherwise, or are necromancers, clerics or paladins who 
        have spells specifically designed for dealing with the undead. For them, 
        this place is a great area in which to increase their experiences in the 
        world, and almost anybody will group with them if they are interested 
        in doing so. 
      <p>For the rest of us, this place has a lot to offer still. The various 
        undead have a high spawn rate and carry around a lot of cash, so if you're 
        careful it's very easy to make a lot of experience and a lot of money. 
        Some of the higher undead carry bronze weapons and rawhide armor, which 
        is worth a fair amount of money. 
      <h3><b>The Keys</b></h3>
      <p>This dungeon is unique among the lower level dungeons in that you need 
        to obtain keys to move around the dungeon at will. All of the keys are 
        obtained by killing various shadowknights, and the shadowknights will 
        give the appropriate key and also all keys lower down in the key chain. 
        For instance the second SK gives her key as well as the splintered wooden 
        one. The first key, the splintered wooden key, is obtained from all the 
        SK's, but must initially be obtained from the dark elf SK in the room 
        to the west of the well and where Skeleton Lrodd spawns. This opens the 
        first locked door. The second key, the charred bone key, comes off of 
        the female SK in the room with the pits, and opens the door directly across 
        the hall. The third key, smoked glass key, spawns off of the ogre SK who 
        also spawns the barbed armplates. This key opens the third and final door 
        at the bottom of the ruined stair. This key is also a no camp item, so 
        if you log off when you come back it will be gone. You can also reach 
        the lower level by either falling through the pits in the female SK room 
        or going through the pit (not recommended due to significant damage from 
        fall).</p>
      <h3><font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
        <font size=+2>B</font>efallen</h3>
      <p>Befallen can be reached through a small, partially hidden tunnel along 
        the southern wall of the West Commonlands. An unholy glow marks the entrance 
        at night, and during the day one must climb the dunes to find it, as it 
        is hidden behind an upward-jutting sand dune.
