<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">Like so many others, I registered just so I could toss in my two cents here, even if I am a week late.  I found this whole discussion very refreshing and reassuring.  It's good to know that other people are reacting the same way that I am.

1. I'm not so concerned about the amount of new content at the lower levels, but then I haven't run out of fresh content yet.  What really troubles me is the way that the high level content is screwing up the lower level zones.  For example, the addition of Cazel to Oasis is a disaster.  Orc highway used to be a fun place to hunt, even though it was quite dangerous.  SGs, specs, mummies, and "A" Orcs made the place treacherous.  Now they toss in Cazel, who you can't even run away from.  What was Verant thinking about?  Why did they feel the need to drop Cazel into the middle of a well balanced, well designed zone?  What will be the next zone to get some uber critter dropped into it just so the level 55 crowd can have some fun and show off their godlike powers in front of all of us peons?

2. I don't think that anyone really objects to some level of twinking.  However, Verant chooses to ignore the impact that twinking has on the lower levels of the game, and the fact that a lot of higher level players are immature and irresponsible.  It's bad enough that there are level 3 warriors with full cobalt armor and LoWs, but what really makes it bad is that so many of the uber twinks feel the need to *tell* everyone how twinked they are.  Every twink Paladin in Unrest seems to feel the need to tell everyone "I've got Ghoulbane."  It's bad enough to know that any newbie character that I create will not match up to the uber twinks.  I don't need it rubbed in my face, and then hear Verant say "this is all okay."

3. All of this makes me wonder whether Verant is totally out of touch with its own game, or whether they are a lot smarter than it seems.  No one is going to dispute that higher level characters deserve fresh content.  But saying that the rest of us are just in a transitional phase?  Are they serious?  I agree with Muse 100% on this one.

4. Finally, I was pleased to see some of the comments about Lady Dae.  Just about everything I have read by her has made me mad.  I see two possibilities.  First, she's off her rocker and really believes some of the incredibly condescending nonsense that she spouts.  Second, she's toeing the corporate line and is doing the best job she can.  For her sake, I hope it's # 2.
