      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      <p>Cobalt Scar is named after the Scars of Veeshan, where Veeshan itself 
        rent the earth on the continent of Velious. Since that time, it has filled 
        with water, and now stands as a lethal harbor for any who venture nearby. 
        Sirens lure ships to the rocks to shatter and sink, and wyverns and drakes 
        guard the entrance to their city, Skyshrine. 
      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>angers </h3>
      <p>The largest danger to most people venturing within Cobalt Scar are the 
        wyverns and cobalt drakes that can be found all along the top of the ridge. 
        These are on Claws of Veeshan faction, and so if you can safely travel 
        through Skyshrine you can travel through here. The risk is that if you 
        are not safe in Skyshrine you can be hit by the large and lethal breath 
        weapon of the cobalt drakes as they attack someone else, even if invisible. 
        The exit back to Skyshrine is also surrounded by drakes and wyverns, and it is very 
        hard to reach it without being attacked if they don't like you.
      <p>The sirens are the next most lethal creatures in the zone. All of them 
        are enchanters and many are difficult to spot, lingering on underwater rocks 
        or swimming near their cove. Since they are powerful casters, they are 
        especially dangerous.  Since they are enchanters, they can charm
        you, and hit you with magic-based direct damage spells.
      <p>There is also a Bulthar camp underneath the tower leading to
       Skyshrine. Bulthar have a very large aggro radius, but do not see through
       invisible.
      <p>Lastly, there is a true dragon that is occasionally found in the water 
        swimming about. He is dangerous for obvious reasons, and water travel 
        is not very safe. 
      <h3><font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>
      <p>The Othmir here generally like anyone, and have merchants as well as 
        give out quests. Some of the quests that they give are quite good. They 
        used to act as guards when fighting the cobalt drakes, but they no
        longer do so.
      <p>Hunting the drakes and wyverns also has an additional benefit in terms 
        of faction. Your standing with them is based on your standing in Skyshrine 
        (Skyshrine faction) but killing them does not decrease your Skyshrine 
        faction at all. Therefore, if you are liked in Skyshrine, hunting here 
        will not screw that up (and actually all the wyverns and drakes will like 
        you). The named ones, however, will give you faction hits if you fight 
        them.
      <p>This zone is also quite open, and is therefore a good place to fight 
        creatures solo, including the drakes, wyverns, and any of the sea creatures. 
        Loot here is also quite good, and gems needed for Velious 
        armor quests drop frequently here.
      <h3><font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
        <font size=+2>C</font>obalt <font size=+2>S</font>car</h3>
      <p>Entrance to Cobalt Scar must initially be gained by travelling through 
        Skyshrine. A Shrine Key is required to use the teleporter from the dragon 
        city to the tower here. Once you obtain the key from the dragon portal, 
        however, you can also teleport here.
      <p>The entrance to Siren's Grotto is underwater. If you travel to the northwest 
        corner of the Scar along the cliff face, you can see the opening under 
        the water there.
      <p>To return to Skyshrine, you only need to touch the statue located at 
        the top of the tower surrounded by wyverns. Returning to Skyshrine requires 
        no key.
