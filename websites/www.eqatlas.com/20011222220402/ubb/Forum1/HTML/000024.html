</FONT><HR><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">When I first sent my slave out to the Dreadlands, I became worried what terrible knoweldge he would bring back about the legendary Lost Valley of the Combine Empire. The instant he spoke with me in my home in northeast Cabilis, my fears turned into a nightmarish reality. <P>His words spoke first of the astonishing height of the teleportation spires in the outpost. Though my poor charge had no measuring string or protractor with which to accurately judge the vertical extent of the pillars in the outpost, he felt that an Iksar could drop for twenty agonizing seconds before hitting ground should that Iksar start from the top. Halting him at that moment and noting that the average fall of a boulder from the level of the Danak shipyards to the level of Charasis or Chelsith took ten seconds, I gaped in disbelief. Permitting further disclosure, he marvelously reiterated the number of teleportation pyramids withing the outpost proper; on a tangent, he observed that quite a few barracks and offices had carved their way into the base of the pads. Moreover, he pressed on, quite a few gardens laid in fair condition upon his arrival. This I knew to be a certain lie, given that no unscaled creature could till the earth of Norrath, and I was then forced to drain his life and prepare ne'Hali cakes from his marrow. <P>The first parts of his story made my tail shiver, though. Combining my spy's report with several documents that I snatched away from Lord Qyzar's private library, I determined that the power of the Combine empire should not be disregarded. Although their people are long dead, their history frightens me; had they taken an interest in our people, even if they arrived, say, during the reign of Emperor Ganak, the casualties on our Sebilisan forces would have reached well into the thousands. Even Harbingers and Reavers on Sokokar mounts would have much trouble dispatching any Combine force that might have arrived, especially accounting for the possible enormity of that force. <P>Now that I reflect on the number of teleportation stands and barracks in the outpost of the Lost Valley, many legions could arrive simultaneously and lash out at Karnor's Castle and the surrounding area immediately, so our people would lose many soldiers at once. Then... then... no. I wonder on a different subject why the Combine build such a large construction. Imagine that it was for an invasion; the pinnacles of the outpost are sufficient to decimate any conceivable magical interference, and that must have been the purpose. The logistics of such building warranted a military proposition only in my mind. From that, I find it plausable that they indeed assaulted an empire: the Ring of Scale would have been a fitting prize for whomever ruled the Combine. Surprising, though, that such a magnanimous individual would not pursue the Plane of Underfoot too, save for that ruler's sure knowledge of the collapse of the Zek empire. <P>Hmm. Well, I have rambled for far too long. If any visitor to this realm knows something about the history of this outpost or how Wyrm or Iksar affected it, please let all see.<P>ADDENDUM:<BR>Further research with another slave (who was equally delicious in my special ni'Hali bone marrow cake recipe) corroborated my original suspicions.<P>Although only convuluted threads of evidence link, for instance, the Ring of Scale with the destruction of the Combine Empire, as per my current pet theory, distinct hints of a ritual or military operation remain in the Lost Valley outpost. <P>Foremost, the tunnel that leads to the lost valley. Visually isolated and physically set away from the Dreadlands proper, the tunnel enjoys the added benefit of curves that contribute greatly to the defensibility of the channel; the total arc length of the passage is probably double the distance from end to end as the worm burrows.<P>More vague secondary clues exist, too. Before we proceed to them, I ought to mention that my first slave's report was inaccurate. The length of the fall from the top of a spire lies at around eleven seconds, but a drop from the edge of the pit in the Overthere requires roughly seven seconds. For comparision, a person plummeting from the apex of a normal wizard spire (e.g. Greater Faydark, North Karana, NOT South Ro, West Commonlands, West Karana) demands about two seconds from start to finish. Keep in mind that the function for time to distance in a descent is roughly quadratic in an atmosphere like that of Norrath. Moving forward... my prior thrall did not recognize several crucial areas, like a rather complete library (about as extensive as the Paineel counterpart, less complete than the one in Erudin), a throne room under the eastern pyramid with a small spire at its top, and several barracks. In all, two open barracks, two closed barracks and one office remain intact within the compound. Only the office has a bed, though, so they had poor sleeping accomodations.<P>Some other points of note were that the alleged gardens (see above about only Iksar being capable of real farming) contained autumn trees and that the Combine endured a two-emblem system. It seems that one emblem was a circle with a v-shaped notch at the top which was itself adored by three feathered wings that extended not beyond the radius of the circlee. The other contained two birds, black with cyan eyes and yellow bills, facing away from each other; maybe there were Spirocs or such? I am inclined to think that the bird sigil was that of the academia, for it it was solely effixed in the library. Moreover, a combined crest, the birds inside the circle, adorned the throne room. The throne itself sprouted the same wings as with the circle design, each holding three feathers. Two bookcases were in this area, with another in the office sector. That said...<P>I have talked for much too long. It is rather sad when the addendum is as long as the main topic... argh. Sorry. Enjoy this report, though, and feel free to comment.<P><BR>------------------<BR>Skorazu Hissanthi<BR>Brood of Kotiz, Cabilis<BR>Torvonnilous<BR>Iksar Archeologist extraordinare<P><BR><p>[This message has been edited by Skorazu Hissanthi (edited 08-26-2000).]</FONT>
