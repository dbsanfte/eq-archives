</FONT><HR><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Ok I was on my guild site today and I noticed a little story by my guild leader. I decided to post it here because I thought it was pretty funny. Enjoy.<P>So there I was.....minding my own business in The Overthere, when all of a sudden I see the message:<BR>"d00d sow plz". <P>Of course, my natural instinct was not to answer, since I thought the clueless newb (hereafter referred to politely as "the petitioner") must have been poorly informed at best.<BR>Boy was I ever wrong.<P>I switch out of 1st person into an external camera, and what did my wandering eyes behold? Only myself and the petitioner.<P>So I says to myself...."Self? You need to edumacate this fella!"<P>(Keep in mind what the overall setting looked like: There I was, in skeleton form, carrying a scythe, FLOATING IN MIDAIR IN A MEDITATING POSITION, with a LARGE dark-brown skeleton named "Gibober" standing behind me. Ummm....No, skippy, I'm not a druid or a shaman.=)<P>I say "Wish I could, bro, but I don't have SoW. I'm a Necromancer." <P>The Petitioner says, "$#*&@#$ ****, sow me already! it's for a cr" <P>Feeling as if my feathers had been ruffled a bit, I do a "/who all dumbass" (um..pardon..I meant "/who all petitioner") <BR>This is where I discovered the "/who all" bug. Certainly it must have been a bug, right? There's NO WAY IN CREATION the dumbas...err...petitioner could have been a level 31 Dark Elf Wizard, right???? RIGHT????? /em begins to cry like a little girl. <P>Well, needless to say, I couldn't have been any more shocked than if my pet began dancing an Irish Jig. I quickly begin the arduous task of maintaining my composure, while deciding how best to deal with this tricky situation.<P>I say, "Necromancer's can't cast SoW".<P>Petitioner says, "Bull@#$%! you cast a spell while you were running and you sped up! i couldn't catch you until you sat down! if you're not going to sow me just say so you dont have to be a **** about it a$$hole"<P>Yes I know....he didn't use any punctuation in that last sentence.<P>I say, "I have JBoots." <P>He says, "what are they" <P>Before I have a chance to pick my chin up off the floor....<P>Petitioner asks, "can you buff my hps my hp sux" <P>I say, "I can't buff you, dude. I'm a necromancer. I only have one buff that you would probably want." <P>He says, "yeah the one you won't give me ****"<P>Ok. Time to have fun with the hopelessly clueless. <P>I say, "Why do you need a sow?"<P>He says, "i need to get to burned woods to hunt. sumbody said its perfect for my level"<P>Yep. That's what he said......"burned woods". <P>I say, "man are you ever in the wrong place." <P>He says, "?" <P>Apparently he found the "question mark" key <BR>conveniently located nearby other various and sundry communication facilitators. <P>I didn't answer him. <P>He repeats, "??" <P>Found it twice...good for him.<P>He repeats, "???" <P>Having an IQ greater than plantlife, I sensed a pattern forming. <P>I say, "You are NO WHERE near Burned Woods." <P>He says, "my friend told me it was in kunark" <P>I say, "Yeah, the operative word there is 'WAS'. There was a major patch a couple of months ago after a bunch of complaints were filed about 'static content'." <P>He says, "?" <P>I say, "!" <P>He says, "?" <P>I say, "," <P>He says, "***" <P>I say, "no, already have some." <P>He says, "????" <P>I don't respond. <P>He says, "so where the @#$% is burned woods" <P>He lost the question mark button again. Probably popped off when he was sniffing his feet. <P>I say, "Well, THIS week it's south of Freeport. It changes with every patch, since they began randomizing zone locations." <P>My guild is hysterical at this point. And I haven't even told them the ENTIRE story yet. Just snippets. <P>He says, "@#$% i just got off the boat" <P>I say, "You don't need the boat." <P>He says "why" <P>I say, "You're a wizard!" <P>He says, "how you know that" <P>I say, "I did a /wh...nevermind....the important thing is you have teleportation spells." <P>He says, "oh yeah the green ones"<P>I nod. I say, "Yep. The 'green ones'. Pretty nice how you have them grouped by color." <P>He says, "thx" <P>I say, "How'd you think about doing it that way?" <P>He says, "they were all @#$%## up when i got this char" <P>I say, "Sit down and mem the spell 'Fay Gate'." <P>He says, "why" <P>Question mark key is on the ground in front of your chair, guy. Mixed in with your collection of boogers. <P>I say, "It's going to put you within spitting distance of Burned Woods." <P>He says, "how do you know" <P>I say, "All patch messages come with a zone connection map." <P>He says, "oh" <P>I say, "Ok. You have it memmed now?" <P>He had just stood up after what I assumed was meditating/looking at his spell book. <P>He says, "yeah" <P>I say, "Ok. Cast the spell and let me know when you get there." <P>Dumba...errr....Petitioner begins to cast a spell. <P>A LONG time goes by.....ok, maybe 5 minutes I still haven't heard from him. <BR>Getting curious: <BR>I tell petitioner, "Are you there yet?" <P>No reply. No reply at all. [Yes, I'm a Genesis fan... ]<P>Obviously he's there, or my tell wouldn't have gone through.<P>I tell petitioner, "Hit the 'r' key to reply to me."<P>He replies, "i'm here now where do i go." <P>Right idea....wrong punctuation mark. Oh well. "C" for effort. <P>I tell petitioner, "Ok, do you see a hotkey on the screen that says 'Sense Heading'?" <P>He replies, "no" <P>I reply, "Hit the arrow buttons one by one until you see one." <P>It was a guess, but an educated one. <P>He replies, "found it" <P>I reply, "Click on it." <P>He replies, "north" <P>I reply, "Ok, you need to head east along the path. Keep going until the path turns north. When it forks to the right, take the right fork." <P>He replies, "ok" <P>Who knows, maybe the guy who sold his account on Ebay worked his Felwithe faction up. <P>He replies, "sumbody told me i shouldnt be here cause i'm a dark elf" <P>I reply, "They were roleplaying." <P>He replies, "oh hehe @#$%@#$ morons ;P" <BR>Priceless. Utterly priceless, I tell you. <P>I reply, "Where are you?" <P>He replies, "i see something now. looks like a castle" <P>I reply, "Run into the castle as fast as you can. The guards might give you some trouble, just keep running." <P>Yeah...damned conscience started kicking in. <BR>A fairly long period of time passes. Not sure how long, but longer than I was expecting. <P>I tell petitioner, "What happened?" <P>As if I didn't know.... <P>He replies, "my spells are gone!" <P>I reply, "What happened?" <P>He replies, "i died why" <P>I reply, "Oh man! Did I tell you to run east or west?" <P>He replies, "east ***???" <P>I reply, "Yikes. My bad. You should have run west." <P>He replies, "?" <P>I reply, "So where are you now?" <P>He replies, "how can i tell" <P>I reply, "Look right after you see 'Loading <BR>please wait'. It should tell you 'You have entered [zone]'." <P>He replies "it doesnt say [zone] there." <P>After smacking my head against my monitor.... <P>I reply, "What does it say in place of [zone]?". <P>Get this.... <P>He replies, "Burning Woods" <P>I nearly fell out of my chair! I couldn't have PLANNED it that way! <P>He replies, "is that the same as burned woods" <P><BR>I reply, "No, but you're close. Start running south so you can get your corpse back." <P>He replies, "i have to get my corpse back?????" <P>/ignore petitioner <P>Moral of the story: EBay...Just Say No!<P>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<BR>He's the follow up on that guy<BR>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<P>Out of sheer curiosity, I took him off ignore later to find out what happened. <P>I tell petitioner, "How's it going?" <P>He replies, "***? where you been" <P>I reply, "been afk, sorry." <P>He replies, "got my corpse back. some dude rezzed me." <P>My conscience somewhat eased... <P>I reply, "Really? Cool! Where are you now?"<P>He replies, "iceclad ocean" <P>I scratch my head a few times. <P>I reply, "Why Velious?" <P>He replies, "the guy that rezzed me told me burned woods was in western wastes this week" <P>I don't recall exactly how long it took me to stop laughing. I stopped breathing shortly before my dog dialed 911. <P>He replied, "@#$%&* wouldnt sow me either. what is that sh#$ gold?"<P>That's what finally killed me. I'm writing this from the afterlife. <BR> <P>I hope you all enjoy this, I know I did.  <IMG SRC="http://www.eqatlas.com/ubb/biggrin.gif"><BR></FONT>

</FONT><HR><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I just laughed my... I mean read this post and I have to agree with you on the guy. I've only been playing this game for about 1.5 months (after finally giving up UO)but at least I did some research about the game before I played. Courtesy is very helpful in this game and I've seen many, many players that have no idea of what that word means except "hey man give me something". I think I'll try to sell my 3rd lvl bard on e-bay , lol.</FONT>
