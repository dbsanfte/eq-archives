<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">I have a few minutes, so here goes.....

Since you've only started playing for a week or so, you're in the "still checking this class out" phase - you'll have no problem playing any class through at least L9 or so. After that, you'll have a better idea on what you want to do - be a blaster-caster/pet-caster/healer-caster (and the associated constant book-med until L35), or whack stuff around (and not med, but be semi-dependent on those that do), or a hybrid between the two ....like your Druid.  :)
All the classes are OK, depends on what YOU prefer to do....

Gearwise, starting off, your druid wood elf could make patchwork (wolf pelts)- that'll get you started w/o being dependent on anyone else, for the most part, and can be accomplished pretty cheaply (all relative here...). If you don't want to do that, lots of folks basically give away patchwork, so keep your eyes open. After that, IF you can wear banded, that's the next logical step (look around for deals), but since your Dru can't, get used to your look - it won't change drastically for a while...sorry :0

Getting gear "within your level" (either fighting for it or questing for it) is a tough call (ex: in the time/$$ it takes you to make banded you could have purchased it for less, but if you learned the skill to make it, you could sell it too). By the time you can fight critters that drop decent armor & weaps, you more than likely have bought, traded (or given) similar or better stuff. 
That said, don't be afraid to group with folks a few++ levels above you, if you're hunting in a place that drops decent loot, or gives good experience. You may get less experience battle-for-battle, but it can work to your advantage - you may end up with some stuff (loot or exp) you wouldn't get otherwise. 
Case in point: When my warrior was L17 in Oasis, a L14 Shaman didn't want to team up, due to the experience loss he'd get. At L18, I teamed up with a Druid that just hit L14. Four hours later he hit L15 ...ok I hit 19.5, but that's not the point  :) Nice kid, had a lot of fun - never met him before, currently on my /friends list ...gave him a bunch of armor & a nice weap I had gathering dust in the bank  :)

Different level creatures in different zones: Outside the newbie areas, get used to it - it's that ~risk/reward~ thing kicking in, as you start to venture out from the relative safety of the town guards   hehehhe

Begging:  ...begging /ooc for freebies generally will get you nothing. If someone's selling stuff you need (particularly newbie stuff), politely /t the gal/guy & see if they'll give you a deal since you don't have a lot of cash & you're just starting out. If not, do without it for the time being ...it'll come. Joining a guild ~may~ get you some stuff at a discount, too.  
Remember: If you stumble across people like me (and there are a lot out there), just by  being friendly & a non-pest, you'll probably make out in the end. (Another example: When my L4 dwarf cleric was scouting around Kunark, I started talking to a guy waiting for the boat in Firiona Vie. He just up & gave me a Lizard Scale Mantle!! All I had on me was a 3-leaf clover I found on the ground, so I gave it to him. He never saw one before, he thought it was pretty neat & thanked me for it).

I think finding a buyer for "common stuff" is a hassle; I personally give away stuff all the time. Twinking? Maybe. Returning past favors from other people? Yep. 

SOL: ....see above & don't beg  :)

My "main" is a 1/2 elf druid (...because not many do, that's why ....And Your Point Is?) I started in Qeynos, so I could hunt in Everfrost - sorry, Muse, that's MY fave newbie ground  :) Once I got cammo, I hit the road - I'm more interested in adventuring than ~powerlevelling~ - you'll meet a lot of folks when you move around ....some you'll look for all the time (aka: /friends).
As a druid, I never had a lot of trouble soloing through the late twenties, just team up with a basher or caster if you're over your head a little. BTW, when soloing, kiting bores me - snare, burn & melee works fine. Once you hit your tele level, you can port all over the place to find a group, so it's not a big deal. 

Have I made any sense? Probably not, but at least...
