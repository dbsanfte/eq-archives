Info). Take a look at <a href="Default.htm#whatsnew">What's New</a> in our web.</p>

<p>EverLogs is a character analyser and statistics program for Everquest. &nbsp;
Information is collected from the log file generated by Everquest.&nbsp; I am designing
this program to be as complete as possible and include all possible data that you would
like to see about your time in Everquest.</p>

<p>Go to Features to check out a few of the things that EverLogs can do for you.</p>

<p>This program is still evolving and I appreciate any and all feedback from the Everquest
community.&nbsp; If you have any comments or suggestions, please send them to me at <a href="mailto:blood@gralin.com">blood@gralin.com</a></p>

    <img src="images/dot.gif" width="8" height="8"> I now scan the log file when loading it

    many people point out this problem with the program.&nbsp; The problem is that the text in
    the log file is exactly the same as when you loot a mob, so there is no way to distiguish
    your own corpse from a mob when you loot.&nbsp; I am going to try something in the next
    version to see how it works out.&nbsp; I will have it make the assumption that people
    generally don't kill and loot anything until after they have retrieved their corpse, so I
    will exclude the next loot after they die from the loot total.&nbsp; It is the only real
    way to fix the &quot;bug&quot; because of the ambiguity of the log file.<!--mstheme--></font><!--msthemelist--></td></tr>
