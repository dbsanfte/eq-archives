<p align="center"><u><font face="Arial Narrow" color="#FFFFCC">Here you will 
find our recruiting policy, guild rules and Raid rules.</font></u></p>

<p align="center"><i><font face="Arial Narrow" color="#FFFFCC">The guild rules 
are basic, simple and should be easy for all.&nbsp; They exist for the benefit 
of all.</font></i></p>
<p><u><b><font color="#33CCCC" face="Arial Narrow">First off...&nbsp; 
Recruitment.</font></b></u></p>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow">At this time we are recruiting only levels 45 and 
higher.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow">Our recruiting policy has changed recently and is 
as follows:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow">All new members will be with us for 2 weeks on a 
&quot;probationary&quot; basis to begin with.&nbsp; During this time you should talk to 
other members, group with them if you can and cooperate in guild events (if any 
are scheduled during this timeframe).&nbsp; Be sure to follow game rules and 
follow raiding instruction and just basically get along.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow">After your 2 week &quot;probation&quot; is up, we will confer 
to speak about how you are getting along in the guild.&nbsp; As long as you 
haven't been a nuisance or a disruption to the rest of the game, followed the 
rules and got along with the rest of the guild we can consider you a permanent 
member of our family and at this time we will take in any of your alternate 
characters regardless of level.</font></p>
<p><u><b><font face="Arial Narrow" color="#00FFFF">Guild Policy</font></b></u></p>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow" color="#FF9999">1.</font><font face="Arial Narrow" color="#ccccff"> 
Use your common sense.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow" color="#FF9999">2.</font><font face="Arial Narrow" color="#ccccff"> 
Know the game's rules and play with good etiquette.&nbsp; Kill-Stealing and being a 
nuisance to other players and being a compromise to other gamers' fun&nbsp; will get you reprimanded and/or removed.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial Narrow" color="#33CCCC">Advice: </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow" color="#FF9999">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font size="2">&nbsp;</font></font><font face="Arial Narrow" color="#33CCCC" size="2">a.)&nbsp;
</font><font size="2" face="Arial Narrow">If you have an issue with another 
player, keep it out of public channels, please restrict it to /tell.&nbsp; No 
one wants to hear&nbsp; people ranting about other people, and badmouthing 
someone in /OOC makes you look like an ass too.&nbsp; I can't tell you how many 
times I have walked through a zone and been spammed with an argument I didn't 
want to hear.&nbsp; And how childish and foolish the parties appeared to me and 
all others around.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<font color="#33CCCC">b.)&nbsp; </font>Noting the above... there is a /petition 
command, use it if you feel you have a problem that talking out with your 
adversary isn't going to fix, such as harassment by them, repeated KSing (and 
KSing isn't someone walking into your &quot;camp&quot; and taking an UNENGAGED mob before 
you can pull it), ninja-looting, repeated training.&nbsp; GM's WILL investigate 
these things if you send them a /petition.&nbsp; If you have a person who is 
harassing you /report them and petition a GM and then use /ignore.&nbsp; It's as 
simple as that.&nbsp; These functions were added to the game for a reason.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<font color="#33CCCC">c.)</font>&nbsp; Share the problem with the guild if you 
feel you need to talk about it....&nbsp; vent, but don't let the problem take 
over.&nbsp; Also an eye-for-an-eye, getting back at soandso by repeating on them 
whet they have done for you isn't the way to go.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow" color="#FF9999">3</font><font face="Arial Narrow"><font color="#FF9999">.</font>&nbsp; 
If you have an issue about another guild mate, please leave it out of guild 
chat.&nbsp; Keep it to yourself and try to work it out between the two of you.&nbsp; 
If you need help working out the issue contact one of the guild officers or 
leaders via /tell and we can attempt to work out the situation in a private 
channel or even if you want us to assist before the issue gets tough contact us.&nbsp; 
We do not want a war inside our ranks, we will assist where we can.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow" color="#FF9999">4.</font><font face="Arial Narrow" color="#ccccff"> 
Try to help out your fellow guildies. <font size="2">&nbsp;(we do have community 
property, and low characters can be assisted, please assist if you have extra 
equipment)</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow" color="#FF9999">5.</font><font face="Arial Narrow" color="#ccccff"> 
Play nice.&nbsp; We do have people contact us regarding our guildies if they act 
inappropriately.&nbsp; We do not ask for people to watch our guildies, but most 
people in the game know a member of another guild somewhere and word spreads.&nbsp; 
Bring us a good name.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow" color="#FF9999">6.</font><font face="Arial Narrow" color="#ccccff"> 
Make an attempt to participate in guild events <font size="2">(you don't have to 
do all events, it's not a</font> <font size="2">requirement,</font>
<font size="2">but it helps the rest of us if you try)</font>.&nbsp; Raids are fun, 
but not alone hehe.&nbsp; We know you have lives, so if you want to raid, please work 
with us all to set up times that work for everyone.&nbsp; If you cannot come, please 
give notice so we can work things around the open space.&nbsp; Other members need 
raids to help them get their Epic pieces, you will too eventually.&nbsp; Most people 
will be reluctant to assist someone who has not helped out once or twice so at 
least keep that in mind when events come about.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow" color="#FF9999">7.</font><font face="Arial Narrow" color="#ccccff">&nbsp; 
Members MUST register with our message board.&nbsp; All raids and guild events are 
posted there a week ahead of time.&nbsp; Contact me Ostarra for passwords or 
registration info.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow" color="#FF9999">8. </font>
<font face="Arial Narrow" color="#ccccff">&nbsp;Members are encouraged to /gu 
speak often.&nbsp; This will help you make friends faster.&nbsp;&nbsp; We don't ignore /gu 
tells, but will miss tells if we are busy.&nbsp; If you have something to say, go 
ahead and say it, if we don't respond, don't feel discouraged.&nbsp; If you need 
help, ask, if you don't get a response, Try again =).&nbsp;&nbsp; We try to help out when 
we are not busy, but of course there are days where we can't pull away from what 
we are involved in.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow" color="#FF9999">9.&nbsp;</font><font face="Arial Narrow" color="#ccccff"> 
Guild Grouping....&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow" color="#ccccff">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>
<font face="Arial Narrow" color="#33CCCC">a.)</font><font face="Arial Narrow" color="#ccccff">&nbsp; 
Experience groups... Loot system is pretty much FFA (free for all) depending on 
the area.&nbsp; It's up to the party of course, but most often we FFA in xp grouping.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow" color="#ccccff">&nbsp;</font><font face="Arial Narrow" color="#33CCCC">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
b.)</font><font face="Arial Narrow" color="#ccccff">&nbsp; Loot groups...&nbsp; Turn based 
looting or ML assigned.&nbsp; Hard drops are rolls.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow" color="#ccccff">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><font face="Arial Narrow" color="#33CCCC"> 
c.)</font><font face="Arial Narrow" color="#ccccff">&nbsp; Raid Groups...&nbsp; 
Need before Greed, if you don't need it, you don't get it unless it's a 
duplicate.&nbsp; ML always assigned.&nbsp; Rolls on drops over need.&nbsp; Epic pieces rolled on between 
raiding class in need.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow" color="#ccccff">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>
<font face="Arial Narrow" color="#33CCCC">d.)</font><font face="Arial Narrow" color="#ccccff">&nbsp; 
These are basic rules, but are subject to change during the events or 
situations.&nbsp; We work to make things amicable for all involved.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow" color="#FF9999">10. </font>
<font face="Arial Narrow" color="#ccccff">&nbsp;HAVE FUN!&nbsp; This is a game and 
that's what it's about.</font><font face="Arial Narrow">&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't take 
things too seriously, it's not worth the aggrivation.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow" color="#33CCCC">Raid Rules</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow">You will have your job during a raid and you will 
be informed of what will be needed of you.&nbsp; Please stick to what is asked 
of you.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow">Assist who you are asked to assist.&nbsp; The 
person pulling is not necessarily the person you want to assist as puller may be 
off scouting another mob at the time you assist, reason being, we don't want you 
sending off a pet only to have it get killed by whatever they were targeting at 
the time and have an angry mob we aren't prepared for come back to eat it's 
owner.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow">Keep /rs spam to a minimum, unless it has to do 
with the raid situation (chat in /gu for random other stuff so everyone can weed 
out what they need to see in /rs).&nbsp; If you have an idea, or disagree with 
raid leader's decision, do not state so in /rs, send the Raid leader a direct 
tell and they will keep your advice in mind.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial Narrow">Most important thing during a raid is to follow the 
instructions given by the raid leader.&nbsp; Going your own way can mean your 
life or the life of your raid members.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial Unicode MS" color="#ccccff" size="2">(more to come when a 
situation arises where a rule must be made for the good of the guild)</font></p>
