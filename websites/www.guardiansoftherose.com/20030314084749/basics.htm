      <p align="center"><font color="#CCCCFF" face="Arial Unicode MS">Most 
      people have this HUGE list of requirements for being in their guilds.&nbsp; 
      In my opinion that just puts too much pressure on everyone and takes away 
      from everyone's fun.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#CCCCFF" face="Arial Unicode MS">But this is what we 
      expect from our members.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#CCCCFF" face="Arial Unicode MS">1. Use your common sense.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#CCCCFF" face="Arial Unicode MS">2. Know the rules and 
      play with good etiquette.&nbsp; Kill-Stealing and being a nuisance will 
      get you reprimanded and/or removed.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#CCCCFF" face="Arial Unicode MS">3. Try to help out your 
      fellow guildies. <font size="2">&nbsp;(we do have community property, and 
      low characters can be assisted, please assist if you have extra equipment)</font></font></p>
      <p><font color="#CCCCFF" face="Arial Unicode MS">4. Play nice.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial Unicode MS" color="#CCCCFF">5. Make an attempt to 
      participate in guild events <font size="2">(you don't have to do all 
      events, it's not a</font> <font size="2">requirement,</font>
      <font size="2">but it helps the rest of us if you try)</font>.&nbsp; Raids 
      are fun, but not alone hehe.&nbsp; We know you have lives, so if you want 
      to raid, please work with us all to set up times that work for everyone.&nbsp; 
      If you cannot come, please give notice so we can work things around the 
      open space.&nbsp; Other members need raids to help them get their Epic 
      pieces, you will too eventually.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial Unicode MS" color="#CCCCFF">7.&nbsp; Members MUST 
      register with our message board.&nbsp; All raids and guild events are 
      posted there a week ahead of time.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial Unicode MS" color="#CCCCFF">6. HAVE FUN!&nbsp; This 
      is a game and that's what it's about.</font></td>
