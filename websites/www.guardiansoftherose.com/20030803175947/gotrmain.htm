<marquee style="color: #33CCCC; font-family: Papyrus; font-size: 12pt" loop="2">ANNOUNCEMENT!!!  We have recently merged with Chaotic Winds...  I am asking all current members to assist in the merger and join us in the Chaotic Winds family by joining the guild...  E-mail me if you have any questions...Ostarra@guardiansoftherose.com</marquee></p>
<ul>
  <li><font size="2">NOTICE:</font>  <font size="2">A lot of you who have read the GuildMOTD may be wondering what's up...  we have merged with Chaotic Winds and for a few reasons... A lot of you are Epic ready and a lot of you are always ready to group with your guildies but we always seem to be short on bodies no matter how many members we have.  We are doing this all for you.  Chaotic Winds are a guild that has as many members as GoTR but they span many time zones, and have many high level people on at one time.  They are fun and friendly and always willing for adventure.  They are also a guild that raids much more than we alone have been able to.  Please join us in the move.  Your high alts should move and you may keep your low alts here with GoTR since the guild will stay acative with our lower characters =)  I will remain here until everyone knows what we are doing and to counsel anyone in /gu chat who need information.  E-mail me also...  I hope to see you all joining us in Chaotic Winds. </font>
