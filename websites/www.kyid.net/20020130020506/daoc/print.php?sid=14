    Sanya Answered a bunch of stuff on the Vault Network overnight...<br><br>

<p>1) Relics. I will check and see if we have this in our knowledge base yet. I don't think it is, so here you go. At this time, you've got three relics, each with a bonus type. (You can find out what the item type is by looking at it.) If you capture a relic that gives your realm a bonus to magic, you need to bring it to your "magic" keep. Gotta keep similar relic types together. <br><br>2) Spind dungeon. Overlooking the way you just sweet talked me, (;)) the best way to get the holes fixed is to let us know where they are. From bitter experience, I know you can't get an X,Y because our system boots you to a safe point immediately. But can y'all give us clues as to where these bad spots are? "Staircase, second room, base of steps" kind of thing. Our turnaround on fixing holes is really pretty kickass. Obviously, we walk around and look for holes, but you guys will just plain find more than us. <br><br>Not sure what to say about the spawn rate - from what I can tell, your milage may vary depending on the group. We will keep an eye on it. <br><br>3) Icons for skalds and healers are high on the art priority list. (It's more complicated than just whipping out an icon. The spreadsheet here has the spell tied to the icon tied to the spell effect. We're changing that, but it takes time.) I don't want to promise a time here, but the new icons are mostly done. As for the shouts, thanks for the reminder, you should see a small change within the next week and a half (insert usual disclaimer about barring the unforeseen, blah blah blah). <br><br>4) Cabalists are doing what? I missed the original edition of this "riot," so this is news to me. Any cabalists want to pipe up? <br><br>5) Yup, speed hackers and other such are getting banned - first strike, you're out. We're not insane about it, people can appeal and we even reinstated one guy. But we are whacking people with the sledgehammer of justice. It's a PVP game, can't have some people with tremendous advantages or the game loses its meaning. <br><br>6) Exactly what do you mean by line of sight here? If it's the one where you get "your target is blocked" when it isn't the least bit blocked, we are aware of it and working towards a solution. If you mean something else, please clarify for me. <br><br>As for collision detection... shudder. It's something we are aware of, please believe me on that score. <br><br>7) Guards don't fight guards because that's way too exploitable - haul a bunch of guards over to the enemy keep and have them do all the dirty work for you? Bah. They're there to defend against players. Not very realistic, but human nature being what it is, our choices were limited. (We're fixing that thing where you could get a guard to follow you forever.) <br><br>8) We're working on the trade skill that lets you put bonuses on player made items. You should see it in a few weeks. <br><br>9) Looking into the paralyze spell thing. <br><br>10) Thanks for the feedback, and the love for the quest team, they appreciate it. Epics quests for 40th should be finished within a few weeks. No, this doesn't help the fastest levelers. Quests like that take a lot of time to script, plan, test, and activate. <br><br>11) Where the hell did you hear two minutes on archer re-stealth? Yuck. No. We are occasionally short sighted, not completely brain dead. We are fixing a couple things with archers, though. One, you'll lose your hide when you nock the arrow. Two, the little bug that lets you hide as soon as you let go the arrow (but before it hits the target) is being fixed as well. <br><br>12) An armsman hitting for 250 sounds bad - but I can't know for sure unless I know what level he was, what level you were, what weapon he was wielding, and how often he whacked you for 250. There are a number of circumstances in which a 250 damage is totally cool. For instance, if he was 36, you're 40, he's swinging a big heavy and SLOW 2HB - that's within parameters. I'm not saying there's no problem, just saying that without more info I can't tell one way or another. <br><br>13) My suggestion would be post 40, stop grinding out exp and just play the game. Enjoy it. Let exp be something that happens as opposed to something you seek. Have some fun or something like that. You'll max out eventually. That's just me and my opinion, though. The difference between 40 and 50 is not supposed to be the one between 20 and 30 or 30 and 40. <br><br>Thanks for the list, hombre, much appreciated. <br><br>Rhyssa: <br><br>8) Hibernia is actually doing really, really well in the item wars. Ahead of Midgard, honestly - the suggestion I heard was check the outdoor camps a little more. Lots of out of the way nooks have more goodies than have been found yet. <br><br>9) We're just looking at this whole mez type spell type in general, not realm specific. <br><br>10) See the comments above - there will be more epic love, soon =)</p>

<p>Okay, part of the insanity over two bug fixes seems to be related to how fast you think you can restealth. <br><br>To recap for those of you who have managed to miss the nine billion threads on the topic, earlier today I told the community about two upcoming archer adjustments. One, when you nock the arrow, you'll lose your hide. Two, when you shoot your bow, you will no longer be able to hide between the arrow's release and the target being hit. <br><br>Now: If you have not been in combat (hit or been hit) you can IMMEDIATELY restealth. So, the conversation involving finding your range and how you will be destroyed is not really relevant. Nock the arrow, realize you're out of range, restealth, and move. In the immortal words of another poster, lose the purple cloak on the battlefield and you'll be fine. <br><br>Second - where did this insane rumor about a 30 second restealth timer come from? No. No. NO. After you have hit someone, or been hit, the timer is ten seconds like it's ALWAYS been. Nothing about the timer is changing. ALL we are doing is fixing it so when an archer nails someone with an arrow, the game counts it as a hit and you have to wait the ten seconds. It's a bug fix. I swear. <br><br>I've been saying that the game is not balanced for one on one PVP. A group is highly recommended in RVR combat. </p>
