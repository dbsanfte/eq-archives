					<p>From the Fringe guide:</p>
	<blockquote><p>Flamenco as you&#8217;ve never experienced before! Moving quickfire into the modern world, traditional flamenco meets hip hop for a fabulous fusion of old and new.</p></blockquote>
	<p>The guide also lists a website for the show at: <a href="http://www.flamencoflow.com/">http://www.flamencoflow.com/</a></p>
	<p>The venue for this show was the <a href="http://www.mtc.mb.ca/warehouse.html">MTC Warehouse</a>.  It is a small professional theatre house that was quite comfortable to sit in for the show.  This was the first show I have ever seen at a Fringe festival, and I suppose it was a decent leaping off point.  The start felt a bit slow to me. I&#8217;m not sure why, but it did.  It took me a little while to get into the show.  </p>
	<p>The guitarist was enjoyable to watch and listen to.  There was one segment that really impressed me where he appeared to be picking with both his strumming hand and the hand on the neck of the guitar. I was slightly surprised that an acoustic guitar with pick-ups wasn&#8217;t used.  The guitar was a non-amplified guitar with an external microphone positioned near the guitar.</p>
	<p>The dancing portions of the show were an interesting hybridization of urban dance with the Spanish flamenco.  Perhaps hybridization is too strong a word.  There were two dancers; one was a male hip hop dancer, and the other was a female flamenco dancer.  The staging of the two was in a format of a dance-off against each other.  Given that the show was about an hour long, what at first is interesting can grow a bit repetitive after a while.  That is exactly what happened from my perspective.  Both dancers had a certain number of moves, and after the second round of dancing off against each other, I realized that any more dance-offs were not likely to contribute much more to what was already seen.</p>
	<p>The show was enjoyable at an overall level, and I liked the guitar playing enough to buy the guy&#8217;s <acronym title="Compact Disk">CD</acronym> on my way out of the theatre.

					<p>I just found out about <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/">Google Spreadsheets</a>, and they once again left me shaking my head with how well they are pushing the web browser as a main-line application interface.</p>
	<p>I have a small spreadsheet that I use to keep track of my personal budget.  Not that I ever really pay attention to my budget, but I occassionally glance at it.  The problem I have had is one of portability.  I first created an Excel spreadsheet at work one day, but then needed to use it at home.  Then I switched my home OS from XP to a flavour of Linux, and consequently used OpenOffice, which rquired me to re-write some of my macros.</p>
	<p>While <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/">Google Spreadsheets</a> may not be as advanced as Excel or OpenOffice, it is more than good enough to keep my simple budget spreadsheet for me, and allow me to access it from essentially anywhere.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Would you like it if the Government of Canada, knowing that someone was planning or conspiring to harm or kill you, did nothing?</p>
	<p>Well, Garth Tolms an opinion writer in <a href="http://www.weeklies.ca/times/">The Times</a> (March 2, 2006) appears to think they shouldn&#8217;t go out of their way to prevent it.</p>
	<p>Garth, in a rambling and disjointed column shares his perspective on why Canada should not be involved in the conflict in Afghanistan.  Garth suggests that &#8220;[the people the Canadian Armed Forces are engaging] aren&#8217;t really our enemy&#8221;, and asks &#8220;what have they done to us&#8221;.  He then admit that &#8220;a few Canuncks have been killed&#8221; but chooses to discount these deaths as evidence of attacks against Canada saying &#8220;&#8230;but that doesn&#8217;t mean it is an attack against Canada&#8221;.</p>
	<p>Unfortunately for Garth, the deaths of Canadians as a consequence of fundamentalist actions does constitute an attack.  Indeed, a threat doesn&#8217;t become a threat only when a threshold of Canadian blood has been spilled.  Canada has already experienced more than a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_India_flight_182">couple</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atilla_Altikat">acts</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tara_Singh_Hayer">terrorism</a> on our soil.  Further, there are several known incidents where terrorists have been <a href="http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=9676">prevented from completing assignments</a> on our soil.</p>
	<p>Garth then suggests that if we aren&#8217;t on Osama Bin-Laden&#8217;s &#8220;list&#8221; yet, &#8220;we will be soon enough&#8230; Thanks to General Hillier and our new PM&#8221;.  Garth presents Canada&#8217;s involvement in Afghanistan as some sort of spur-of-the-moment decision since &#8220;our new top general has decided that we are a military and sometimes our job is to kill&#8221;.</p>
	<p>Even a simple Google search would have revealed to Garth that Canada <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/story/news/?/news/2001/10/07/us_attack011007">started mobilizing troops for deployment to Afghanistan around October 8, 2001</a> when Jean Cretien was still the Prime Minister.</p>
	<blockquote><p>Speaking in Ottawa, Chrétien said Canada is mobilizing some military units for the coalition, but said he wouldn&#8217;t provide detailed information that could endanger lives.
</p></blockquote>
	<p>Canada has been participating in Afghanistan since (approximately) late 2001, and yet Garth pins our involvement on the new top general and new Prime Minister.</p>
	<p>Garth further states that perhaps we are involved &#8220;because the US is our friend&#8221;, and then recommends that &#8220;we [should] just worry about our own borders and let the States do their own thing&#8221;.</p>
	<p>I have no doubt that our proximity to the US, and our relations with them were certainly contributing factors to us deciding to join an <strong><em>international sanctioned coalition</em></strong> [<a href="http://daccess-ods.un.org/access.nsf/Get?OpenAgent&#038;DS=S/RES/1267%20(1999)&#038;Lang=E&#038;Area=UNDOC">Resolution 1267 (1999)</a>, <a href="http://daccess-ods.un.org/access.nsf/Get?OpenAgent&#038;DS=S/RES/1333%20(2000)&#038;Lang=E&#038;Area=UNDOC">Resolution 1333 (2000)</a>, <a href="http://daccess-ods.un.org/access.nsf/Get?OpenAgent&#038;DS=S/RES/1363%20(2001)&#038;Lang=E&#038;Area=UNDOC">Resolution 1363 (2001)</a>, <a href="http://daccess-ods.un.org/access.nsf/Get?OpenAgent&#038;DS=S/RES/1388%20(2002)&#038;Lang=E&#038;Area=UNDOC">Resolution 1388 (2002)</a>, <a href="http://daccess-ods.un.org/access.nsf/Get?OpenAgent&#038;DS=S/RES/1390%20(2002)&#038;Lang=E&#038;Area=UNDOC">Resolution 1390 (2002)</a>, and <a href="http://ods-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N03/214/07/PDF/N0321407.pdf?OpenElement">Resolution 1455 (2003)</a> ] to move against the Taliban in Afghanistan.  I would also suggest that since Canada has been the target of attacks or attempted attacks in the past we are not out line in wanting to participate in neutering the Taliban in Afghanistan for the defense of our own nation.</p>
	<p>Garth&#8217;s final reason to not participate in Afghanistan is because our soldiers are now &#8220;politically correct and pampered&#8221; and &#8220;most of them can&#8217;t stand up to their own spouse, never mind an angry suicidal militant&#8221;.</p>
	<p>Setting aside how insulting Garth&#8217;s last assertions were to our military, it should be pointed out that a Globe and Mail report from last week described the forces arriving this month in Kandahar as follows:</p>
	<blockquote><p>
The 2,200 Canadian troops arriving this month have at their disposal an array of hardware and personal kit that, many soldiers say, makes them the envy of the international coalition in Afghanistan.
</p></blockquote>
	<p>Garth&#8217;s attack on our military has no credibleness and only serves to demonstrate how little strength his argument has.  His position simply does not stand when held up to the light of reason.</p>
	<p>Radical fundamentalism is a growing problem in today&#8217;s world, and given that there have been both successful terrorist attacks and foiled plans of terrorism towards Canada, it would be irresponsible of our Government to not participate in a sanctioned action which should improve security for all Canadians in the long run.</p>
	<p>I will leave the last words to <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20060301.wdentandtfirstp0301/BNStory/Afghanistan/home">Michael Den Tandt</a> from the Globe and Mail:</p>

Soldiers are soldiers. During three weeks in Kandahar, I heard occasional griping. I heard many expressions of fatigue. The group I stayed with in Kandahar had been there six months. They&#8217;d had enough.</p>
	<p>I also heard, to a surprising degree, numerous expressions of idealism — an idealism that should give Canadian critics of this mission pause.</p>
	<p>There was Capt. Kerri-Ann Iwanonkiw, a 26-year old with a brilliant smile, who spoke passionately about helping Kandahar&#8217;s girls hold their first-ever craft festival.</p>
	<p>There was Capt. Francois Giroux — a man who on previous tours has witnessed horrors that most Canadians could not imagine — yet remains deeply optimistic about the military and its ability to project Canadian values.</p>
	<p>There was Chief Warrant Officer Ward Brown, a soldier&#8217;s soldier and veteran of eight tours, whose voice broke as he spoke about the Afghan poor, and about the psychological burden that Canadian soldiers will take home with them, when they return home.</p>
	<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure that there are young guys on their bunks, at night, that aren&#8217;t sleeping,&#8221; he told me.</p>
	<p>Polls show that many Canadians remain unconvinced about the merits of the Afghan mission. The debate is sure to continue for months. It is likely to intensify when more Canadians are killed in action, which is likely.</p>
	<p>Whatever the tenor of the debate, however, no one should forget this: Canadian troops in Afghanistan are not politicians. They are soldiers, all volunteers, doing an extraordinarily dangerous job because they believe in it. They are risking their lives to help people who desperately need help.</p>
	<p>They deserve nothing less than strong, unqualified support.

	<p><a href="http://www.hillsdale.edu/imprimis/">Hillsdale College</a> has an abridged speech Mark Steyn gave in 2005 about the UN. </p>
	<p>Remember,  *waves hand in front of your face*, &#8220;There is no genocide&#8221;!</p>
	<blockquote><p>
The [good people of Darfur in Sudan] have instead fallen under the care of the UN multilateral compassion set. So, after months of expressing deep, grave concern over whether the graves were deep enough, Kofi Annan managed to persuade the UN to set up a committee to look into what’s going on in Darfur. Eventually, they reported back that it’s not genocide.</p>
	<p>That’s great news, isn’t it? Because if it had been genocide, that would have been very, very serious. As yet another Kofi Annan-appointed UN committee boldly declared a year ago: “Genocide anywhere is a threat to the security of all and should never be tolerated.” <strong>So thank goodness what’s going on in Sudan isn’t genocide. Instead, it’s just 100,000 corpses who all happen to be from the same ethnic group</strong>—which means the UN can go on tolerating it until everyone’s dead, and none of the multilateral compassion types have to worry their pretty heads about it.
</p></blockquote>
	<p>Emphasis mine.</p>
	<p>Remind anyone of Rawanda?</p>				</div>

					<p>via <a href="http://timblair.net/ee/index.php/weblog/comments/phoenix_nix_mopix/">Tim Blair</a>;</p>
	<p><a href="http://thephoenix.com/article_ektid3588.aspx">Boston Phoenix</a>:</p>
	<blockquote><p>Out of fear of retaliation from the international brotherhood of radical and bloodthirsty Islamists who seek to impose their will on those who do not believe as they do. This is, frankly, our primary reason for not publishing any of the images in question. Simply stated, we are being terrorized, and as deeply as we believe in the principles of free speech and a free press, we could not in good conscience place the men and women who work at the Phoenix and its related companies in physical jeopardy. As we feel forced, literally, to bend to maniacal pressure, this may be the darkest moment in our 40-year publishing history.</p></blockquote>
	<p>The comment section on Tim Blair&#8217;s post of the above contained a link to a <a href="http://www.sydneyline.com/Adversary%20Culture.htm">speech given by Keith Windschuttle</a>.  It is a long read, but definitely worth it.</p>
	<p>Here is a snippet:</p>
	<blockquote><p>
&#8230;personal terrorism affects not just those directly under threat, but all writers and intellectuals. Most are unable to afford the security costs and the state cannot protect them all. The result is that they are silenced by self-censorship.</p>
	<p>This is why the debate over the Danish cartoons is so important. To date, the response has been mixed. Newspapers in Norway, Germany, France, New Zealand and Australia have reproduced the cartoons in defiance of the violence that has been perpetrated in Middle Eastern countries and threatened in many Western countries by crowds with signs such as: “Slay those who insult Islam.” “Butcher those who mock Islam.” and “Be prepared for the real holocaust.”</p>
	<p>&#8230;</p>
	<p>The real problem here was not the Western newspapers who published the cartoons but the Islamic response to them. Our political leaders did not blame the latter but turned the responsibility onto ourselves. Enclosed by a mindset of cultural relativism, most Westerners are loath to censure Muslims who go on violent rampages, burn down embassies and threaten death to their fellow citizens. Many of us regard this as somehow understandable, even acceptable, since we have no right to judge another religion and culture.</p>
	<p>The truth is that the riots, the arson, the death threats were not spontaneous outbursts from passionate religious believers but were carefully stage-managed by Muslim leaders. The imams of the Danish Muslim community consciously ignited the response some four months after the cartoons were published. They travelled to the Middle East where they generated support for a campaign quite deliberately targeted at Western culture&#8217;s principle of freedom of expression.</p>
	<p>Their real aim is not religious respect but cultural change in the West. They want to prevent criticism of its Muslim minority and accord that group special privilege not available to the faithful of other religions. Instead of <em>them</em> changing to integrate into our way of life, they want to force <em>us</em> to change to accept their way of life.</p>
	<p>Muslim rage over the cartoons is not an isolated issue that would have been confined to Denmark and would have gone away if nobody had republished them. It is simply one more step in a campaign that has already included assassination, death threats and the curtailment of criticism. And our response, yet again, has been one more white flag in the surrender of Western cultural values that we have been making since Khomeini&#8217;s fatwa against Rushdie in 1989.</p>
	<p>The Western concept of freedom of speech is not an absolute. The limits that should be imposed by good taste, social responsibility and respect for others will always be a matter for debate. But this is a debate that needs to be conducted within Western culture, not imposed on it from outside by threats of death and violence by those who want to put an end to all free debate.</p>
	<p>The concepts of free enquiry and free expression and the right to criticise entrenched beliefs are things we take so much for granted they are almost part of the air we breathe. We need to recognise them as distinctly Western phenomena. They were never produced by Confucian or Hindu culture. Under Islam, the idea of objective inquiry had a brief life in the fourteenth century but was never heard of again. In the twentieth century, the first thing that every single communist government in the world did was suppress it.</p>
	<p>But without this concept, the world would not be as it is today. There would have been no Copernicus, Galileo, Newton or Darwin. All of these thinkers profoundly offended the conventional wisdom of their day, and at great personal risk, in some cases to their lives but in all cases to their reputations and careers. But because they inherited a culture that valued free inquiry and free expression, it gave them the strength to continue.</p>
	<p>Today, we live in an age of barbarism and decadence. There are barbarians outside the walls who want to destroy us and there is a decadent culture within. We are only getting what we deserve. The relentless critique of the West which has engaged our academic left and cultural elite since the 1960s has emboldened our adversaries and at the same time sapped our will to resist.<br />
The consequences of this adversary culture are all around us. The way to oppose it, however, is less clear. The survival of the Western principles of free inquiry and free expression now depend entirely on whether we have the intelligence to understand their true value and the will to face down their enemies.

	<p>A rather large smile crept across my face a few minutes ago, when I read that the new ruling Conservative Party has already put the wheels in motion to begin dismantling the steaming pile o&#8217; crap that we Canadians know as the gun registry.  My smile got even bigger when I read that the Conservatives plan to use some of the $90,000,000+ (yes, it is that obscene a waste of money) to field another 1000 RCMP officers in this country. </p>
	<blockquote><p>The Conservative government has created a committee of two cabinet ministers and a backbencher to figure out how best to kill the long-gun registry as soon as possible.</p>
	<p>Registry critic Garry Breitkreuz, who is working with Justice Minister Vic Toews and Public Security Minister Stockwell Day, said he has been given wide leeway to deal swiftly with the registry.
</p></blockquote>
	<p>I have always said the gun registry is a complete waste, and for a program that was &#8220;only&#8221; supposed to eat $2,000,000 (in total, not per year), it has spiralled into a $1 billion+  monstrosity.</p>
	<p>Captain Ed&#8217;s post linked at the start of this post spins a bit of Oliver Stone-ish conspiracy into the story, but it is a good read.  It would be utterly sickening if his conjecture was true, but I&#8217;m not willing to assume the Liberals would go that far (at least, not yet).</p>
