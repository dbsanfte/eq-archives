				<p>This movie rates a 9/10.</p>
	<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0388789/">Born Into Brothels</a> is a powerful film.  It really speaks to the tragic life that faces children growing up in the red light districts of Calcutta, India.  This documentary focuses on a group of kids in the red light district of Sonagchi, Calcutta; however, it is not hard to imagine that similar lives exist in all the red light districts in India, or at least in Calcutta.<br />
<a id="more-230"></a><br />
Zana Briski is a photographer who as we learn in one part of the documentary, travelled to Calcutta to pictorially document the lives of the women in the red light districts in Calcutta.  While she was doing this, she decided to teach the children of the prostitutes how to do photography.  In the course of teaching them photography, she has developed an emotional attachment to the children, and doesn&#8217;t want to see them continuing to live out their lives in the red light district, eventually (for the girls at least) becoming prostitutes themselves.  </p>
	<p>Part of the greatness of this documentary is that Zana does not appear in the film any more than she has to.  She lets the kids drive the documentary, and it brilliantly focusses on the children.</p>
	<p>This peering into the world these children live in is sometimes slightly emotional in nature.  These are children.  We know this is a real documentary.  And as adult human beings, most of us have a tendancy to want to shelter and protect the young, even if they are not our own.  These three things combine to make the insights into the lives of the children that have been born into brothels have a greater impact.  When you see and hear the children recount stories of their father trying to sell a child for money, or a child whose father is a hash addict and is shown on screen so we can see the shell of a human being he has become, you feel a sense of helplessness for these children.</p>
	<blockquote><p>
&#8220;There is no such thing as &#8216;hope&#8217; in my future.&#8221; - Avijiti (a young boy in the film)
</p></blockquote>
	<p>The above quote is an especially disturbing one as you watch the film.  Not only because you know it summarizes not just Avijiti&#8217;s future, but all the children&#8217;s futures unless an escape is given to them.  But Avijiti himself is, in a way, particularily special.  If you see the film you will know what a talent this child has with a camera.  The way his vision of the world is captured onto film surpasses capturing moments in time, and approaches works of art.  Armed only with a cheap point and shoot he was taking shots that amazed me in their vision, complexity, simplicity, and creativity.  He is truly a talent with a camera.</p>
	<p>Zana (whom the children refer to as &#8220;Zana Auntie&#8221;), takes it upon herself to at least give the children an outlet from the terrible futures that lay ahead of them.  She shleps all over Calcutta to get paperwork the children need, she fights with the local bureaucracy to get things done, and at times the frustration of not getting things accomplished shows.  But she continues to try on behalf of the children.  Really, the best outlet to get the children out of the red light district is to get them into boarding schools.  However the problem is that children born of prostitutes are regard as very low on the scale of importance in Calcutta, and almost all boarding schools will patently refuse to even consider taking in a child of a prostitute.  But Zana continues to try and find the escape the children need if they are to break the cycle of working in the red light district themselves.</p>
	<p>One nice touch of the documentary is that at regular intervals throughout the film we are given short slideshows of each child&#8217;s photos, and we can see how creative and impressive the photos taken by these children are.  It only adds to the sad knowledge that these children could grow up to be great functional people if they were in a &#8220;normal&#8221; environment, but instead you know they are going to grow up to be criminals, and prostitutes, and the beauty and creativity that we see in their photos now, will be a distant memory in another ten years.</p>
	<p>The film isn&#8217;t all depressing.  There are moments of genuine humour in it, and we get to see the young minds of the children as they get to go on some field trips with Zana Auntie.  When given the opportunity, they behave as children - picking on each other, playing, dancing, singing, and being spontaneous.  But we are given frequent reminders of the reality back in their homes, the abuse, the drugs, and in one tragic case, the murder of one of the children&#8217;s mother by her pimp who set her on fire.  This last case also showed the complete apathy of the police about lives that are lost in the red light district as Zana is told in a matter-of-fact manner that the police will do nothing about the woman&#8217;s death.</p>
	<p>The end of the documentary also causes us to pause as the fates of the children (at the time of the end of the documentary) is made known to us one by one.  You certainly don&#8217;t leave the theatre feeling on a high note.  There is some positive, but also enough negative to easily temper one&#8217;s emotions.  I have never been in a theatre that had ~100 people in it, and heard it that quiet for the whole movie, and even after the lights came on.  It was just silence as people got up to leave.  I think that speaks volumes for the job that Zana did in making this documentary, and she deserves to be commended for it.</p>
	<p>The viewing format is not widescreen due to the cameras used.  It is closer to standard television&#8217;s format of 4:3.  The film is sub-captioned as the bulk of it is in an Indian dialect.</p>
	<p>If you have the opportunity, I would highly recommend seeing this movie.
