					<description>Hey, I saw Robots tonight with Matthew - I didn't think it was that great.  There were a few set pieces that appeared to be strung together just to show us what crazy Rube Goldbergs/Awesome Animators were involved in the creation of the film, but there were also jarring gaps in the narrative.  I suppose they need to keep things to 90 minutes so they don't lose the kids' interest - Matthew sat through the entire thing.  Then again, he was just as interested in the Famous Players Kids magazine, eating popcorn and having sips of my diet coke at times.  

Lots of characters - hard to keep things straight - no real depth.  Who really cares what happens to these guys anyway?  They're toasters for fraks-sake! :)  Compare and contrast with the Incredibles or the Shrek movies, where things procede at a digestible pace and you develop more of an affinity to the characters...those films were never a drag, even though there were some very non-action scenes.  Sometimes you have to break up the frenetic pace a bit.  Maybe it's just Robin Williams himself - anytime he's onscreen it's like a 70's coke-fest.  Wooooooooooo!  Lookatme! Lookatme! I'm nutty! WOOOOOOOOO!  Take it easy for a second, man...

Of course the bizarre anti-profit / evil corporation meme running through the film is just the sort of Hollywood tripe that they want us to start shovelling down our kids throats at the tender age of 3.  Kind of ironic they push that message, meanwhile they serve up some lame-ass, hokey, cliche-driven plot that amounts to &quot;anyone can do anything if you just reach for that rainbow.&quot;  Way to go out on a limb, fellas... 

But, hey...Matthew enjoyed it.  BTW: Do they make movies exclusively for kids anymore?  It seems to me that everything that comes out is aimed just as much at the older crowd as the kids.  There was a lot of that in Bugs Bunny, as opposed to the straight-laced Mickey Mouse - but these days it's all Bugs and no Mickey, if you follow me...(Shrek, Shark Tales, Robots, etc...).  </description>

					<description>&lt;blockquote&gt;cliche-driven plot that amounts to “anyone can do anything if you just reach for that rainbow.” Way to go out on a limb, fellas…&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ahh... you know it was a movie directed at kids, right? :)  I'm not surprised at all by the writer's direction in the film.  Isn't child-rearing these days all about neutering competition at as young an age as possible, and every kid, no matter where they finish the race gets a participation ribbon?

&lt;blockquote&gt;It seems to me that everything that comes out is aimed just as much at the older crowd as the kids&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I agree.  I think it is due to a couple things.  Primarily it probably makes parents less resistent to taking their child to an animated movie if it means they won't have to sit grinding their teeth for 90 minutes asking themselves, &quot;When will this be over?&quot;  Second, I think there is more recognition in Hollywood that adults can enjoy some animated movies, and therefore they aren't as rare as they used to be.

&lt;blockquote&gt;BTW: I don’t know how you can give that movie a 7 and shit all over Shaun of the Dead&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Probably because it fell exactly into where I was expecting it to fall.  Besides, for all my &quot;shitting&quot; I still gave Shaun of the Dead a decent review :)
