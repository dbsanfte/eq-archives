<h2>Perhaps you are all wondering where to find the Lumiere Divine boards?</h2>
<h2>How about trying <a href="http://www.lumieredivine.net/">www.lumieredivine.net</a>!</h2>
<h2>That's right folks, we have our own domain now... enjoy!</h2>
<h3>Complete integration of the old an new will take a little while, but for now... The new boards are up and running...</h3>
<h3>An unfortunate side-effect of the new boards is that the login feature from the main page of the website will not work for a while.</h3>
<h3>I will try to get it fixed as soon as I can.  For now, treat logging into the boards and logging into the member areas of the main page as two separate things...'cause they are ;p</h3>
<h3>Cheers! - Tao.</h3>
