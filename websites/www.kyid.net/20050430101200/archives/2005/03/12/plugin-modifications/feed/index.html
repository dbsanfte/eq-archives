					<description>Actually I installed that plugin on the 10th, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bloglines.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Bloglines&lt;/a&gt; stopped pulling the feed on the 7th, so I don't think they are related.  I did email the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bloglines.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Bloglines&lt;/a&gt; team about the feed not working, and they replied that they would look into it, so I would guess they did something on their end.  Especially since the feed was working in readers other than &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bloglines.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Bloglines&lt;/a&gt;.</description>
