					<p>Ok, I ran with my new runners and socks today.  At first (perhaps the first couple mins) it was a tiny bit uncomfortable across the outside edges of my feet.  I am <em>very</em> flat-footed when I walk or run, and these new runners have very strong motion control support so my arch is held up when I run and my feet don&#8217;t pronate as much as a consequence.  However, the net effect is that there is more effect on areas of my foot and legs that were used to not having that support around usually.  The outside of my feet felt better after a couple minutes, but my shins feel a bit sore now, so I don&#8217;t know if that is a general effect of my running, or an effect of the new shoes that I have to adjust to.</p>
	<p>I did my new 3/2 walk/run intervals again today, however, I only did four sets of 3/2 and the fifth I did as 2/3 followed by my 5 minute walking cooldown.  That last set was killer.  I was really, really pushing myself to not stop at the end of the third minute.  I did persevere, but wow it really took a lot out of me!</p>				</div>

					<p>I added a few new plugins to the blog since yesterday.</p>
	<p>The first one is <a href="http://ryanduff.net/wp-plugins/wp-contactform/">WP-ContactForm</a> which is a simple plugin that creates a contact form so I don&#8217;t need to leave my email address dangling all over the internet for bots to harvest.</p>
	<p>The next one I installed was <a href="http://dev.wp-plugins.org/wiki/css-compress"><acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> Compress</a> which simply compresses the <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> file for this page when it is streamed out to you the reader.  It claims to compress the 8k file to 1.7k.</p>
	<p>I then installed <a href="http://www.huddledmasses.org/">Acronym Replacer</a> which adds a special tag to certain defined acronyms so you get a tooltip describing the acronym.</p>
	<p>Finally I installed <a href="http://www.cowpimp.com/archives/2004/06/08/staticize-plugin-for-wordpress/">Staticize Reloaded</a> which creates a cache to serve up pages from instead of always needing to hit the db to retrieve things.

					<p>I bought new running shoes tonight.  They set me back a small fortune, but I am very happy with my purchase (no buyer&#8217;s remorse yet).  I bought &#8220;proper&#8221; running socks as well.  Apparently they don&#8217;t get abrasive like cotton can when it absorbs sweat. I also bought an exercise mat.  It is 2&#8242; x 6&#8242; x 2&#8243;, and folds in half for easy carrying.  So, I will be embarking on a routine of doing some crunches and stretches in the mornings before I head out to my workout.</p>
	<p>I also bought 6 jugs of 1.89L V8 from Safeway (I would have bought more, but that was all they had).  Safeway has them on sale 2 for 1 until this Saturday, so I am planning on buying a few more jugs before the sale is over.</p>
	<p>Oh, and today was the Wednesday weigh-in.  And today&#8217;s number is:</p>
	<p>233 lbs.</p>
	<p>*sigh*  I am not sure what the deal is with hovering in the 233 range all the time.  I just hope my body gets its act together soon and starts dropping pounds!

					<p>Lower quad update: &#8220;Still sore! More to follow below!&#8221;</p>
	<p>Well, when I got to the <a href="http://www.wellnessinstitute.mb.ca/">Wellness Institute</a> this morning I decided to try changing my interval timings and see how I felt.</p>
	<p>Since this past <a href="http://www.kyid.net/archives/2005/03/06/post-workout-update/">Sunday</a> I have been doing a 30 minute workout consisting of 5 intervals of 4/1 walk/run with a 5 minute walk at the end.  Today I decided to try a harder workout, so I changed my intervals from 4/1 to 3/2 walk/run with a 5 minute walk at the end.  The first three intervals were not too bad.  By the third I was starting to feel my breathing get more laboured and it was much harder to get my breathing back to normal in time for the fourth interval.  The fourth and fifth intervals were hard.  The fifth was killer and I really wanted to stop running after one minute.  But, I pushed myself to finish, &#8220;Come on, it&#8217;s the <em><strong>last</strong></em> one! Suck it up!&#8221;.</p>
	<p>Prior to the workout I stretched both my calves and my quads, and I think it really helped.  My quads <em>are</em> sore, but my gut feeling is that they would feel far worse if I didn&#8217;t stretch considering the interval change I made today.</p>
	<p>I will try this same interval timing until next Wednesday, and see how I feel from that point about switching to a 2/3 walk/run interval.  Though, based on this morning, I may need to stay at 3/2 for a while.</p>				</div>

					<p>Well, I went to the meetup tonight, and had a pretty good time.  Actual talk of photography related things were mostly on the fringe with the people I was talking to.  We, for the most part, spent the evening (3 hours) just chatting about everything and anything.  I thought it was a great way to start feeling comfortable with these people.</p>
	<p>A few people brought some photos they have done. I brought about 6 or 7 to have people look at.  I will have to work on getting my gallery set up on this site so I can upload all my photos to share them with the world. Be afraid.  Be very afraid!</p>
	<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure, barring any conflicting engagements, I will attend the next one in April.

					<p>I am thinking of registering for two marathons here in Manitoba.</p>
	<p>The first one I am thinking of is the Great-West Life 2.6 mile Super Run segment of the <a href="http://www.events.runningroom.com/site/?raceId=1206">Manitoba Marathon</a> (2.6 miles = ~4.2 km).  I hope I can get up to running 0.5 km non-stop by then, so I would approach it as a walk/run type race.</p>
	<p>The second marathon is the <a href="http://www.events.runningroom.com/site/?raceId=1274">Running Room Canada Day Series 2005 (Winnipeg)</a>.  I would enter the &#8220;5K Fun Run/Walk&#8221; in this marathon.</p>
	<p>I think it might be a good idea to set some goals like these to help build targets to achieve.

					<p>I am back from my morning workout.  My lower quads are sore as per usual, but not quite as bad as yesterday.  I never bought the Tiger Balm since by the time I got off work my legs were feeling pretty well normal, and I am not sure I want to subject my co-workers to the smell of Tiger Balm during the day.</p>
	<p>If I can remember, I might, after work today, drop by a fitness store to buy an exercise mat for home.  I also want to go to a store that sells running shoes (perhaps <a href="http://www.runningroom.com/hm/">Running Room</a>?) to get a new pair.  The runners I am using are about 5 years old, and I don&#8217;t think they are helping much in the running cause anymore.</p>
	<p>Upcoming for breakfast today:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>vegetarian omlette (seeded chopped tomato, mozz. cheese, red &#038; green bell pepper)</li>
	<li>2 pieces of Canadian back bacon</li>
	<li>a couple glasses of low sodium V8</li>

				<small>March 7th, 2005 at 07:51 <!-- by youngka --></small>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>To say that my legs are extremely sore would be an understatement. I think I need to change my pre-workout strategy.  I have only been doing calf stretches up until this point, but I think I really need to do fairly complete leg stetches from now on.  The pain is in the same general area it has been since day 1 - the quad above the knee.  However, today the pain feels more localized to the part of the quad on the inside of both legs (think inner thigh, but near the knee).</p>
	<p>I couldn&#8217;t run very fast at all today.  I did keep with the 30 minutes on the track that I started yesterday.  My left leg was/is more sore than my right.  I don&#8217;t think I will switch to a 3/1 walk/run interval this week.  I will stay with 4/1 until I adjust to the 30 minutes in workout length, and the soreness in my legs subsides.  I think I will buy some <a href="http://www.tigerbalm.com/index3.htm">Tiger Balm (beware - cheesy flash site)</a> to help with the muscle pain if I can find some.  I used to use it years ago when I studied <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kung_Fu">Kung Fu</a> when I lived in Toronto.</p>
	<p>So my plans for modifying my workout look something like this:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>shop for an exercise mat</li>
	<li>research some leg stretches</li>
	<li>perform leg stretches shortly after getting up, but before heading to gym</li>
	<li>incorporate a limited number of crunches (15-25?) to start developing abdominal strength (perhaps 3-4 times per week)</li>
	<li>adjust as required</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Oh, and I will put off starting a late afternoon workout until my legs aren&#8217;t so sore all the time.  Though, I would like to add one in the future.</p>
	<p>Ok, time for breakfast and the off to work I go.

					<p>This movie rates a 5/10.</p>
	<blockquote><p>A grieving mother, Telly Parada, is struggling to cope with the loss of her 9-year-old son. She is stunned when her psychiatrist and her husband tell her that she has created eight years of memories of a son she never had. But when she meets the father of one of her son&#8217;s friend who is having the same experience, Telly embarks on a mission to prove her son&#8217;s existence and her sanity.</p></blockquote>
	<p>The soundbite above had me thinking this movie might be interesting to watch,  and it was, for a while.</p>
	<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0356618/">The Forgotten</a> was fairly enjoyable until the halfway point, at which point it takes a sharp turn south and never really gets back on an even keel.  I will spare the details to avoid giving away the plot, but suffice to say, this should be a cheap night rental.

					<p>This movie rates a 6.5/10.</p>
	<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0339291/">Lemony Snicket&#8217;s A Series of Unfortunate Events</a> is a tale of three children orphaned by a tragic accident. They are taken in by a distant relative, Count Olaf (played by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000120/">Jim Carey</a>).  Olaf is a person with less than noble intentions for the children.  The film follows the three children as they attempt to survive one unfortunate event after another.  The film has a strong supporting cast and is narrarated by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000179/">Jude Law</a>.  The film itself reminded me quite a bit of a <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000318/">Tim Burton</a> movie in its visual style.</p>
	<p>I&#8217;d definitely recommend seeing, or renting this film.

					<p>Oh damn my legs are killing me.  Right above the knee as usual.  I stretched my workout to 30 minutes today.  That is, 25 minutes of 4/1 walk/run intervals and a 5 minute walk to end the workout.  I was pushing myself to run at a faster pace today, and by the time I got to the last run interval I was feeling pretty gassed (how sad is that?).  </p>
	<p>Oh well, I figure it took me 15+ years to completely get into the utterly poor shape I am now, so I can deal with it if it takes me even a year to be able to run at least 30 minutes non-stop.  Hopefully not that long, since I really want to participate in at least a 5k run by next summer (2006).</p>
	<p>Off to figure out what to make for lunch&#8230;

					<p>If my new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Beach_Diet">South Beach Diet</a> was a car driving on a highway, then yesterday I had a tire blowout that left me sitting on the side of the road in frustration for a few hours.</p>
	<p>I ate way too many pistachios yesterday.  I bet I ate 200 of them at least.  I left the damn bag open near my chair and just kept grabbing more and more of the damn things.  Oh well, live and learn.  I have since removed the evil bag of pistachios to the top of my fridge, where, while accessable, they prove to be much less temptation.</p>
	<p>The Sunday weigh-in happened this morning, and after getting out of the shower today&#8217;s scale says:</p>
	<p>232.6 lbs.</p>
	<p>So, I am down a little bit again, even after <em>Pistachio-Gate</em> yesterday.  Last week I took Sunday off from working out, but I am planning on going today.  A little self-repentance for my over-indulgence yesterday.  As a matter of fact, since I am not on a tight timetable (it being Sunday - no need to hurry to work), I am considering trying a full 30 minutes on the track today.  But we will see.

					<p>I added a hack to the blog to require commentors to pass a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test">Turing Test</a> of sorts (essentially you will need to type in a word you see in an image to make a comment).  It is one more thing to do in order to post a comment, but it should cut down on the comment spam I receive by a large margin.  The upside is that comments are no longer queued for approval (for now).</p>
	<p>I am using <a href="http://www.gudlyf.com/index.php?p=376">AuthImage</a> to accomplish this bit of &#8220;magic&#8221;.</p>
	<p>I will be integrating a photo gallery into the site soon as well.  Perhaps even today if I don&#8217;t feel too lazy about it.  Maybe it will inspire me to stop being such a slacker and go out and take some photos again.

	<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0377471/">Be Cool</a> is the sequel to 1995&#8217;s (has it really been 10 years?) <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113161/">Get Shorty</a>.  If you enjoyed <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113161/">Get Shorty</a> you will probably enjoy this film as well.  I walked out of the theatre at the end thinking it was like watching &#8220;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113161/">Get Shorty</a> Lite&#8221;.  There were some pretty amusing scenes in the film, and I did find myself chuckling quite often.  All-in-all, I would say it is worth seeing as a first-run movie.

				<div class="entry">
					<p>I was talking to my mom yesterday (early) evening trying to talk her into coming over for dinner tonight (Saturday).  I decided to tell her about the Cheesy Frittata I made from the <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/exec/obidos/ASIN/1579546463/qid=1110036846/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl/701-6081304-7300302">South Beach Diet</a> book.  It is the best frittata I have ever tasted.  So she invited herself over last night for dinner instead of tonight, the condition being I had to make the Cheesy Frittata for her.  So, over she came, and I got to making the frittata.</p>
	<p>I put on the TV to entertain her while I chopped vegetables, etc, and what was on one of the Movie Central channels?  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0345074/">Connie and Carla</a>.  I had a feeling this was a movie my mother would like (I had seen parts of it before on Movie Central), so we watched that while I prepped supper.  It was like our own version of <a href="http://tbs.com/movies/dinnerandamovie">Dinner and a Movie</a>.</p>
	<p><strong>The Dinner</strong></p>
	<p>My mom had a couple glasses of wine, I drank Carb Options Raspberry Ice Tea, and we both enjoyed the Cheesy Frittata.  Next time I won&#8217;t add any diced (seeded) tomato.  It added too much moisture.  For desert I made Ricotta Mocha from the <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/exec/obidos/ASIN/1579546463/qid=1110036846/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl/701-6081304-7300302">South Beach Diet</a> book.  I think I need to add a bit more Splenda the next time I make it.  It wasn&#8217;t bad at all, it just wasn&#8217;t as sweet as I expected.</p>
	<p><strong>The Movie</strong></p>
	<p>This movie rates a 6/10.</p>
	<p>I&#8217;m not sure that G would find this movie amusing, but I certainly did.  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0345074/">Connie and Carla</a> reminded me (slightly) of some of the comedies that were filmed in the 50s and 60s.  My mother certainly thought it was funny, as did I.  It was campy, and enjoyable.  I say - rent it.
