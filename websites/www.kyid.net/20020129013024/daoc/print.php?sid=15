    So... I wake up early, as all good Mommies do, to feed my childen.  George had been particularly fussy last night about her brother, Lefty-that is, being bigger than her, so I knew she would be looking for a large breakfast.  Well as any good Nightshade mother knows, the only GOOD meal for a growing dagger is kidney, and what better place to find kidneys, and big ones at that, than Midgard?

So off I goes.  It was a lovely morning till I got to the snowy hills of Midgard.  There is nothing worse than being dressed in black and running on a white hill, except for maybe leaving deep tracks in the snow while doing it.   I hate that part.  Lefty complained of being cold so I knew I'd better plant him in someone's warm back soon, or else he'd be cross.  So...

Well, it really wasn't as cut and dry as all that.   I couldn't take as many pictures as I'd have liked to because of some strange and unrealistic view Midgard folks seem to have about a young mother feeding their friends to her children.   So a few more fell than that;  particularly yummy were the finger-wiggling magic types- a few repeatedly.  Taoism, a fine young Luri, was out testing something or other having to do with the effect of different arrows on how loud Midgards scream-- he agreed to help me at some point as well.  Those multi-meal pics are probably the work of he and I together, but at some point I lost track.
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
Anyway, it was a fine way to spend a few hours, and George really enjoyed herself.  Lefty did, of course, continue to complain about the cold so I suspect that next time, I'll head to green Albion.
<br>
<br>

Good day!
