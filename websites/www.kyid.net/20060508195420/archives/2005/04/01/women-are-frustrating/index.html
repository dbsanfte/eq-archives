			<div class="entrytext">
				<p>Women are frustrating.</p>
	<p>I am a member of several online dating services, one of them being <a href="http://www.lavalife.com">Lavalife</a>.  On my <a href="http://www.lavalife.com">Lavalife</a> &#8220;hotlist&#8221; (basically a personal list of people you are interested in keeping bookmarked), there is one woman in particular that I have had a desire to write to and meet for quite a while now.</p>
	<p>I had, a while back, either sent her a brief message, or a smile to indicate my interest, but received nary a reply.  That was long before I started working out, and losing weight.  I now am feeling much more confident about myself, and I decided to give it another shot by emailing her a fairly long email that was more detailed than my onsite profile.</p>
	<p>Now, before I go any further, you need to understand that this woman has been on my hotlist for a few months at minimum.  I occassionally re-read her profile to see if she changes the text, and I know for sure she is rotating the main picture she uses for her profile.  She is fairly active on Lavalife - I would guess logging in at minimum several times a week.</p>
	<p>The email I sent her outlined more details of who I am, and gave some insights into my values as a person.  I also included this blog address and invited her to read it passively to get to know me a bit better with no pressure at all on her.</p>
	<p>She actually responded kindly.  She basically said she admired my lifestyle changes, and that I should be proud of them (and I am).  But then she said something that I didn&#8217;t quite know how to interpret:</p>
	<p>This is part of what she said in reply:</p>
	<blockquote><p>
I&#8217;m not really actively looking to meet people right now. I just kind of threw a few profiles out there to see what was up. And I have about 1 minute of tolerance for Lavalife before it starts to eat away at my soul, so I dont respond to many messages.
</p></blockquote>
	<p>See, my issue with this is that I know she is active on <a href="http://www.lavalife.com">Lavalife</a>.  She changes her pictures on a semi-frequent basis.  If not interested in meeting people, why keep a profile? Or, at the very least indicate in your profile you aren&#8217;t interested in meeting people at the moment.  I get the feeling she just wasn&#8217;t interested, but was trying to let me down easy.  I would rather have the truth than misdirection.</p>
	<p>So, I decided to reply once more.  I started my reply with a preamble saying that I wouldn&#8217;t send her any more emails after this one unless she responded to it in a positive fashion (i.e. if she responded with &#8220;piss off&#8221; I would assume that was bad).  I then gave her a few more tidbits of information about me and my values, and ended the email by inviting her to email me and ask for my cell number to call me so I could take her to lunch on Saturday or Sunday.  </p>
	<p>She has opened the email, but alas, I have not received a response.</p>
	<p>I find the process of trying to meet someone online to be a massively frustrating one.  I think the women on these dating sites (especially attractive ones) must be deluged by asshole guys looking for one-night stands and such.  As a consequence the women seem to be very guarded about the idea of meeting in real life after only a few exchanges of emails through the <a href="http://www.lavalife.com">Lavalife</a> system.  I find it to be an strange thing because if two people meet in real life (not in some virtual dating system), there wouldn&#8217;t usually be a massive stigma if they were interested in each other, and one asked the other out to coffee, or lunch, etc.</p>
	<p>Another thing that is frustrating for me personally, is that I have very high standards for the type of woman I want to date, and I feel no need to compromise those standards in order to get more dates that I really wouldn&#8217;t be interested in long-term.  My friends and family have at times in the past called me on this and suggested I lower my expectations.  I however maintain that I shouldn&#8217;t have to, and if the price of keeping the bar set where it is means that I am single longer, then so be it.  </p>
	<p>My pickiness about those women I am interested in certainly also proves to be a barrier in the online dating world.  I rarely see profiles that interest me.  I like to see the woman has a visible picture on profile, that she has taken the time to write a profile, and that she has at least a decent grasp of the english language and how to use it.  Demonstrating attributes such as wit and intelligence score points, and being a woman I find attractive is important as well.</p>
	<p>Oh well, in the end I am better for trying to talk her into a date, than having never tried at all, and that is the spin I will have to take from this.
