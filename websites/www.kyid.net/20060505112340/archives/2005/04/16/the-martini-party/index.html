				<p><strong>The Martini Party</strong></p>
	<p>Everyone has memorable experiences in their lives.  Quite often they come in the form of &#8220;firsts&#8221;.  The first time you kissed someone.  The first time you saw the opposite sex naked.  The first time you had sex.  The first time you fell in love.  </p>
	<p>While all of these firsts are usually great and enjoyable memories, there are some firsts which are, well, not so great, but in the long run, just as memorable. Things like, the first time you drank alchohol.  The first time you got drunk.  Or the first time you experienced the, &#8220;oh my God, please let me die&#8221; feeling of a killer hangover the next morning.  This story without a doubt falls into the latter type of memories.<br />
<a id="more-223"></a><br />
I was over at my best friend Grahame&#8217;s house.  I think it was in 1996 or 1997, but it doesn&#8217;t really matter.  I remember that I knew I was going to crashing at his house that night, so I wasn&#8217;t worried about getting home.  We were just going to hang out, and play video games, or whatever we did when hanging out in those days.  </p>
	<p><strong>A Birthday Party!</strong></p>
	<p>At some point Grahame mentioned that a friend of his was having a birthday party that night and that we should go.  She worked in advertizing I think, and had hand made invitations for the birthday party she was hosting in her own honour. She had a theme for the party. It was a Martini Party. Grahame talked me into going, since it was a barbeque and I, quite frankly, had nothing better to do.  So I asked him if it was a dressy event (given that I had arrived at Grahame&#8217;s house wearing a basic slacker look of jeans, T-shirt, and Doc Martens.  He said no, it shouldn&#8217;t be, and then proceded to put on a sports coat.  He was still wearing jeans, but I was already feeling like something was wrong with the picture.  However, I had complete faith in G.  He wouldn&#8217;t intentionally hang me out to dry.  So off to the party we went.</p>
	<p>Now, the girl who was hosting the party, was hosting it at her parent&#8217;s house which is located on a lot of land that extends to the Red River (my memory is rather hazy on this point).  I believe her dad is an architect who designed the house that was custom built.  It is a very nice house, with a backyard swimming pool, and a decently large deck.  From what I remember, it was pretty dark on the road(s) as we got closer to where her parent&#8217;s house was, so I don&#8217;t think it was in a major neighbourhood.  When we got to the land where the house was, there were already cars parked, and the evening of socializing had started.</p>
	<p><strong>Under-Dressed</strong></p>
	<p>We parked, got out of the car, and walked around to the back of the house.  I immediately knew I wasn&#8217;t dressed to be there.  The memories I have of the event are what I call a &#8220;beautiful people&#8221; party.  A bunch of very attractive women, and the guys (I guess) were not exactly bums either.  And everyone was dressed up (at least more than I was).  I think G and I were the only two people in jeans, and he had a sports coat.</p>
	<p>But, hey, that&#8217;s life, so I did my best to not feel uncomfortable.  It was actually fairly enjoyable.  I was drinking either water or diet coke, or maybe both.  Other people were milling around with various types of drinks, with quite a few holding martini glasses since that was the theme.</p>
	<p><strong>High School Memories Re-kindled</strong></p>
	<p>I do remember a few stranger moments in the earlier stages of the party.  One of the guests was a guy I went to high school with.  I hadn&#8217;t seen him since 1989, and it was kinda cool to talk to him and see what he had been up to.  </p>
	<p>The next twist came when a friend of G&#8217;s, Lisa, an ex-model, showed up at the party with her boyfriend of the moment - Alex.  Now, up &#8217;til then I had had an on-again, off-again crush on Lisa.  Nothing too serious, since well, in her world I think I don&#8217;t really exist (not quite rebel, bad-boy enough for her I guess).  I do think of her as a very nice woman, and an occassional acquaintence (I only ever occaissionally see her when G is present, and am invited to the occassional lunch with them - about every 6 months to a year).  But Alex was a surprise.  </p>
	<p>Alex you see, had dated, and really I thought was going to marry, a girl, Eleanor, I had a crush on in high school.  I hadn&#8217;t spoken to Eleanor since high school, or maybe a few years after high school.  It was therefore a rather large surprise to me that Alex and Nory (as her friends used to sometimes call her) had broken up.  It was very strange to run into these people at the party.  People I hadn&#8217;t expected to probably ever see again after high school.</p>
	<p><strong>The First Martini</strong></p>
	<p>Now, the hostess of the party (Lasha), at some point was asking what I was drinking and was dismayed that I wasn&#8217;t having any alchohol.  As I remember it, G and Lasha convinced me to have a small martini in the spirit of the theme of the party.  Now, since it was her party, and quite frankly I felt under-dressed to be there, I didn&#8217;t put up too much of a fight, and quickly found myself in the possession of a rather tasty martini.  To spice things up, Lasha had obtained recipies of flavoured martinis and I was either drinking a chocotini or a crantini, I really don&#8217;t remember which.  </p>
	<p>What I do remember is thinking, &#8220;Wow, these go down like water.  They don&#8217;t even taste like alchohol.&#8221;  I suppose in hindsight that should have been a rather large flashing neon sign to me that said, &#8220;don&#8217;t drink so fast dumbass&#8221;, but I didn&#8217;t see the sign, and the martini was gone in short order.  I put the small martini glass down for a minute, and picked up my non-alchoholic beverage and started meandering around for a minute or two before I decided to try another martini.  So, I headed back to where I had left my small martini glass, but alas, it was gone.  Stolen by another party-goer who needed their fix as well.</p>
	<p><strong>Drinking Like A Fish</strong></p>
	<p>I lamented the loss of my martini glass to G and Lasha who managed to procure another martini glass.  However, this glass was at least twice as big as the last glass.  So, I grudgingly accepted the new martini glass filled with delicious flavoured martini and drank it.  I drank the whole thing within minutes.  I then started on a third.  My thought process at that point was something along the lines of, &#8220;Man this stuff is good!  And it&#8217;s not even affecting me! Woo!&#8221; </p>
	<p><strong>Red, Red Wine!</strong></p>
	<p>Now, somewhere around here in the general time-line of things, I saw that Lasha had a bottle of Wolf-Blas &#8220;Yellow Label&#8221; Red Wine (hands down my favourite red wine), and I pretty much said this to her while slugging back my martini.  So she suggested we open it and try it.  Well, I felt a bit bad since it was a gift to her from someone at the party, but I quickly overcame that and we had a glass of wine each.  It really is foggy for me at this point, but I do think I may have gotten another martini after the red wine.  But more importantly, I needed food.</p>
	<p><strong>Sushi Does The Body Good!</strong></p>
	<p>It was after either the third or fourth martini that I began to get the idea that drinking 3 or 4 martinis on an empty stomach may not be the best idea.  Fortunately for me, our lovely hostess Lasha, had provided a table of food which we could eat.  So, I sauntered over (feeling quite good about myself by this point), and saw that she had sushi on the table.  Well now, I couldn&#8217;t possibly pass up the opportunity to eat some sushi for free!  So I ate some.  Not too much - I didn&#8217;t want to look like a pig - but enough to make me feel like I had something other than alchohol in my stomach.</p>
	<p><strong>Descent Into Oblivion</strong></p>
	<p>Now, here is where things take a turn.  To say that my evening went dark shortly thereafter is not too much of an exaggeration.  I only have snippets of memory of that night to stitch the remainder of the tale together.  </p>
	<p>I went and got another martini (cause damn, these things are good!).  At some point I know I was standing between G and Lisa with my arms around both, because someone somewhere showed me a photo of it, but by that point I was falling off the cliff of drunkeness into oblivion.  There was no turning back.  I finished my martini (the last martini I have ever had to drink), and then the darkness took over.</p>
	<p><strong>I Remember&#8230;</strong></p>
	<p>I remember being in a lawn chair at the back of the pool with G standing nearby keeping an eye on me to make sure I didn&#8217;t do something too stupid. </p>
	<p>I remember I puked. I don&#8217;t know if it was on myself or not, but I know I puked over the side of the lawnchair, which then toppled over dumping me in the middle of it.  </p>
	<p>I remember puking more.  Martinis, red wine, sushi; it was all coming up the same way it went in. Grahame told me afterwards that they had to hose down the whole back of the pool area after I was gone.  Such was the impression I made!</p>
	<p>I remember Lisa bringing me a glass of water and me thinking she was a bloody angel.  I remember lifting the glass to drink the water, but my muscles were so uncoordinated that I completely missed my mouth and actually smacked the glass into my forehead dumping the water and ice all over my own face.  </p>
	<p>I remember Lisa had decided to go swimming (2-piece suit!) and I was so pumped that she was in the water, that I tried to get up and go over to the edge of the pool to talk to her.  Instead, I got up, took a step and did a face-plant into the concrete that surround the pool.  My glasses still bear the scratches of that night on the left lens, even to this day.  </p>
	<p>I remember thinking I should join Lisa in the pool just to show her how cool I was (&#8217;cause you know, as if doing a face-plant in front of her and reeking of vomit wasn&#8217;t cool enough).  I think G saved me from doing a header into the pool and got me back to the lawnchair.</p>
	<p>I remember at some point in my drunken stupor I realized just how badly I had behaved, and I started apologising to G every other minute, and I think, thanking him for being such a good friend.</p>
	<p>I remember G saying something about me not getting into his car the way I was dressed (puke covered clothing).  I don&#8217;t remember who or when, but some person(s) took my shirt and pants off so I could sit in G&#8217;s car for the ride home. </p>
	<p>I remember waking up in G&#8217;s basement the next day thinking I had a bad dream, but it was real.  I really did make an ass of myself.  </p>
	<p>I remember thinking I am lucky to have a best friend like G who had my back no matter what my idiocy was, and how embarrassed I am sure he felt for even bringing me to the party.</p>
	<p>I remember thinking, &#8220;Oh fuck, I don&#8217;t see those guys since fucking high school, and the first time I do, I go to a classy party, get the most shit-faced I ever have in my life, puke all over the place, and do face-plants into concrete.  I&#8217;m sure they will think I did real well after highschool.&#8221;</p>
	<p>I remember I pretty much stopped drinking after that, and only rarely touch alchohol anymore.</p>
	<p>I remember that was the first time I went to a martini party.
