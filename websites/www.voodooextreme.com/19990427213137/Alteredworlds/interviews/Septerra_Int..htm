    <p align="left"><small>Well, you came to the right place for some Septerra Core goodness.
    Sacrates sat down with Brian Babendererde (Say that five times in a row) for a nice
    discussion on a game that is surely going to make a few people warm with anticipation. All
    of that without the use of an Intern too! We also have a few Exclusive screenshots of this
    hot looking game.</small></p>

    Altered Worlds<br>
    Answered by SepterraCore Lead Designer, Brian Babendererde</p>
    <p>1. First of all let's hit the basics, Who are you, what planet do you come<br>
    from, why do you make games, and what is the meaning of life?</p>
    <p><b>We are Valkyrie Studios. We are not a number, we are free developers! We make games
    because we like it, and if life has any meaning, it is to be found in earning a living
    doing what you like: In our case, making games!</b></p>
    <p>2. Now that we've got the hard one's out of the way, lets get the smack on the engine
    your using for the game. Is it 100% 2D or will it have any 3D support built in?</p>
    <b><p>The engine is 640x480 16 bit and 2D. We are working on some great lighting and
    shadowing effects, and some eye popping spell effects, but there is no true 3D element to
    it. </b></p>
    <p>3. The visuals in the game look breathtaking. What kind of spell affects<br>
    will there be? Any type of cool lighing etc. Will I be able to ignite my enemies underwear
    (If they are wearing underwear of course) in flaming glory with that fireball spell?</p>
    <b><p>Like I said, we are working on that, so there's very little we can show / talk
    about. However, the lighting / shadowing effects we are putting in are getting alot of
    &quot;oohs&quot; and &quot;ahhhs&quot; around the office. We can't wait to show it off,
    but it's a little too early right now. As far as igniting your enemy's underwear &#133;
    just wait!</b></p>
    <p>4. Could you elaborate on this &quot;Clock based combat&quot; system you will be using?
    Is it similar to turn based etc or will it be like FFVII.</p>
    <b><p>The player encounters and fights the enemies right in the backgrounds, and each
    combat is resolved before he can go on, (unless he tries to run away!). Each character has
    a gauge that fills up from zero to 100% and determines when he can attack or act. Within
    that &quot;time&quot; aspect of the combat we have some new spins and unique features that
    I can't really talk about right now...Its still a little early to let out the details. </p>
    <p>Our spell system is based on relics called Fate Cards. Each card represents a spell and
    can be cast by itself. However, 2 or even 3 cards can be cast together to create new
    spells. For example, if Maya casts a Barrier Card, it creates a Barrier to protect her
    from damage. If she casts an Air Elemental Card it attacks an enemy with lightning. If
    Maya were to cast the Barrier and another character were to cast the Air Card
    simultaneously, it would create an Air Barrier to protect the player from Air (lightning)
    based attacks. Using combos, there are 128 spells available.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    &nbsp; </p>
    <p>5. How detailed is the combat system anyway? Will we be able to attack particular parts
    of the bodies etc or will it be point and click choose what type of attack to use etc?</p>
    <b><p>Most enemies do not have separate body parts, but almost all of the end-bosses do.
    The player has many options: Each character has up to 9 skills that they can learn or
    acquire, plus the 128 spells that can be created, plus the ability to use items and
    defend. We've really tried to incorporate as much strategy and thought into the combat as
    possible. I really didn't want a game where the action was mindless.</b></p>
    <p>6. Obviously scripted sequences are extremely in vogue right now in such games as Half
    Life, Shogo etc. Will you have built in sequences such as these using the actual game
    engine or will the story progression be handled by cinematic movies? Or more simply
    talking to people.</p>
    <b><p>All of the above. We have an extensive world to explore, as well as a story that
    progresses through movies and with scenes that use game graphics. </b></p>
    <p>7. How deep will character progression be? Meaning, will your character evolve by
    levels or skills etc?</p>
    <b><p>Characters go up in level based on their experience points. Some characters learn
    new skills as they go up in level, while others acquire their skills in different ways.
    For example, if Maya wants a new &quot;skill&quot; for her rifle, she can buy a component
    that plugs into her gun that gives her that ability. It's like getting a new ammo type to
    unload on the enemy.</b></p>
    <p>8. / 15. Overall, how many NPC's can we expect to find in this game? Will there be a
    considerable amount of interaction with them etc? How is NPC interaction handled? With
    extensive dialogue trees or will there be voice actors etc.</p>
    <b><p>There are over 120 NPCs in the game &#133; everything from townspeople to major
    characters and antagonists. All of the dialogue in the game is recorded audio. Different
    members of your party have different backgrounds, interests and motives, so each character
    will have a different conversation with the NPC. Thus, some player characters can really
    help you gather information for solving puzzles, while others may help you find better
    prices in a shop, or help you fill in background story details. </b></p>
    <p>9. Also, will there be any type of character creation at all? Or will it be premade
    etc.</p>
    <b><p>The characters are &quot;pre-generated&quot;, but remember that you have 9 total to
    choose from, and you can swap them in and out of your three-person party at any of the
    Home Bases located around the world. Each character has specialties in both combat and
    non-combat situations, so the player will need to be focussed on creating different
    &quot;teams&quot; to tackle different parts of the game.</b></p>
    <p>10. About how many hours do you expect it would take the average chimp (I mean gamer)
    to complete this game?</p>
    <b><p>About 60 hours, not counting the side missions.</b></p>
    <p>11. Will there be a demo of any form released on the Net preceding the game's release?
    Altered minds what to know.</p>
    <b><p>Yes, a demo will be coming, but I can't say when yet.</b></p>
    <p>12. About how far are you into the game's development cycle? Just spew of a percentage
    of what is complete so far.</p>
    <b><p>I'd say we are at the 70% percent mark, but that's not really accurate, because an
    RPG has so many different elements to it. For a ballpark figure, it's about right.</b></p>
    <p>13. In what ways do you feel this game is going to devaite from your typical RPG game?
    What can we expect from it?</p>
    <blockquote>
      <b><p>1. We've tried to create something that stands apart from most PC RPGs, story and
      world-wise, by creating characters that are deeper than just good and evil archetypes.
      Part of the way through the game you'll start to realize that not everything is what it
      seems, and maybe the &quot;bad-guys&quot; aren't as bad as you thought. </p>
      <p>2. We've stayed away from traditional fantasy settings, and we've tried to deliver
      gameplay and content instead of mindless point and click. </p>
      <p>3. My goal has been to create a detailed RPG with out a needlessly cumbersome interface
      to get in the way. </p>
      </b>
    </blockquote>
    <p>14. Is this strictly a single player game or do you expect to add any form of
    Multiplayer support?</p>
    <b><p>Strictly single player. Making this game multiplayer would have ruined the single
    player game. It would have forced us to change the combat into real time action, or make
    it strictly turn-based, not to mention ruining the cool story arc we've created!</b></p>
    <p>16. How are NPC's handled also. Do they walk around doing their thing, or will they be
    at preset locations and part of the story?</p>
    <b><p>Both. Some NPC are heavily scripted, others are &quot;wandering&quot; and doing
    their thing around town.</b></p>
    <p>17. Who did you vote for in the last Presidential election? This one strictly applies
    to your believability and truthfullness in this proceeding.</p>
    <b><p>Here, I would like to plead the fifth amendment, in that my answer may be grounds to
    incriminate me.</b></font></td>
