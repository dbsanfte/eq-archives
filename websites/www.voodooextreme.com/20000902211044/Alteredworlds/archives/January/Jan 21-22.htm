    <small>Lady Moi was on the boards and had some light to shed on the ongoing situation with
    parties. Been a while since we got some goods on U:A and just gets me <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>that much more toasty for it</strong></font>.</small></p>
    <i><blockquote>
      <p></i><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">It's important to understand
      that very rarely does any 1 thing cause a feature to be dropped from a game. If
      pathfinding had been the *only* issue with the party, I'm told it wouldn't have stood in
      the way. As Trellek states, and Capn'Bill confirms, it really wasn't an issue in and of
      itself. But, as a part of the larger picture, the party was technically difficult to add
      for many reasons.<br>
      <br>
      I was just in the office with Audball, Jackl, Capn Bill and Trellek asking about just what
      happened. Apparently there were issues with how you interact with the party members, how
      to make the party members feel really alive and interactive, how to make the party members
      pathfind intelligently, how to draw all the polygons on the screen and keep the game
      moving quickly enough, how to make the party members engage in combat intelligently,
      etc... then, there were all the other issues the team was dealing with regarding the game
      *in general*. In the face of all the obstacles at that time, this feature seemed just too
      daunting.<br>
      <br>
      The design team was worried about how 'alive' the party would seem. The solutions to the
      technical problems lead to this arrangement where you wouldn't see the members (they'd
      follow behind), you wouldn't interact with them, and they'd automatically attack.
      Suddenly, this feature looked lifeless. What good was it doing anyone?<br>
      <br>
      Okay, now add to this the situation with the changing personnel on the team, the dramatic
      changes in the design staff in particular, as well as changes to the programming staff.<br>
      <br>
      When you roll all this up together, you can begin to see why some decisions are made.<br>
      <br>
      Also, understand when you ask someone a question, you are getting their subjective memory
      about the course of events. This decision to drop the party was made about a year ago
      (says Capn Bill, I think he was speaking generally, so don't get married to that number.
      ;) The team makes decisions and moves on with the design and programming of the game. The
      whys get left behind and people just remember this little tidbit or that little tidbit. So
      please, allow for a little flux between answers that different people give. We all have a
      slightly different experience... and we also care about slightly different things, so when
      time comes to remember it, we think about it a little differently.<br>
      <br>
      Now, in terms of the companions... we're still playing with how they are going to work
      exactly so there isn't an answer to your question yet. :)</font></small></p>

    <small>Of course the day wouldn't be the same without our daily lubing from Abashi at the
    EQ Boards. First he <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>shaves and waxes this guy down</strong></font>
    a bit on the possible upcoming player wipe going into Phase 4.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">If a complete player wipe is
      done, just prior to p4, there will be literally tens of thousands of players, all chasing
      around the newbie areas. </font></small></p>
      <p><strong><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">There will literally be
      10s of thousands of players chasing around the newbie areas anyway. There are 5000 people
      in beta right now. Probably about 20 percent of those have stuck with one character and
      advanced beyond the newbie levels, while the remainder have either tried a lot of
      differing combinations never leaveing newbiehood, or left the beta. </font></small></strong></p>
      <p><strong><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">That's roughly 1000
      non-newbie characters. With 40K+ people coming into phase 4, 1000 people NOT in newbie
      areas is really negligible. </font></small></strong></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"><br>
      : The congestion is going to be bad regardless, but throwing the experienced players into
      this type of frenzied environment will likely turn them off. </font></small></p>
      <p><strong><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Again, it's only 1000
      players spread among many servers and many zones. It's negligible. </font></small></strong></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">: The experienced players know
      enuf about EQ to still gain XP's faster than the newbies, just because they have a much
      better grasp of the system. </font></small></p>
      <p><strong><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">I don't see anything
      wrong with this. </font></small></strong></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">: I just can't envision 500
      players in the newbie section of places like Butcherblock Mtns. The over-hunting will be
      astounding. </font></small></p>
      <p><strong><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">I can't imagine that in a
      server with 1500 people online that 1/3 of them would gather in one zone. There are many
      newbie areas, and people will spread out fairly quickly.</font></small></strong></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>Here is a bit that you possible exploit gamers had better take notice of. RedEye
    is not taking this doggie style at all. They totally go Missionary here and on top all the
    way, so for those of you who like to play with bugs and exploits prepare to take the
    bone...well you know where.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">I want to stress that
      &quot;Banning&quot; is the last action taken, not the first. It can hardly be considered a
      &quot;total ban for all situations&quot;. In most cases, there will be warnings, followed
      by levels of dicipline, and only then if the person in question failed to understand what
      was going on would a ban be requested. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The word &quot;Ban&quot; will
      always be used to indicate a permanent removal. Anything less than permanent will be given
      a different name, such as &quot;suspend&quot;. </font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>Here is a bit on that alien language that us Net users enjoy so much.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The patch server connection is
      currently made via HTTP:80. This may or may not change for final, however, if you can
      reach anything on the WWW you should be fine for the patch server. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The game itself uses UDP at an
      arbitrary port above 1024. </font></small></p>

    Developer board goodness and are dishing the sauce your way. Can't&nbsp; wait to see the

    <blockquote>
      <i><p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">1) When a character is
      &quot;knocked-out&quot; do they die if unaided for a long time or do the eventually wake
      up over time?</i> </font></small></p>
      <p><strong><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">It is possible to bleed
      to death if you are unaided for a fairly long period of time. You will wake up, however,
      and be able to search for help before death ensues. </font></small></strong></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"><i>2) Will a character die
      instantly if he/she fell from a great hight? or just &quot;knocked-out&quot; no matter how
      far you fell?</i> </font></small></p>
      <p><strong><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">You will not be permitted
      to fall from great heights. </font></small></strong></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"><i>3) I guess this is a stupid
      question, but a character could drown right? (meaning permanet death under water)</i> </font></small></p>
      <p><strong><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">If you stay underwater
      too long, your character will be forced to the surface. There is no way to force your
      character to stay under water until dead. </font></small></strong></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"><i>4) Could a character die from
      posioning? I guess it would take strong posion, and left un-treated over time to cause
      death.</i> </font></small></p>
      <p><strong><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Yes, poison will be quite
      deadly. You will have time to search for the antidote of any particularly deadly brews

      a character to die? (ie. exhaustion, exposure, dehydration.etc)</i> </font></small></p>
      <p><strong><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Incessant lack of food
      and water, prolonged severe element exposure, untreated wounds, being eaten by a spider
      and having your throat cut are some of the many possible champions of permanent death. </font></small></strong></p>

      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">You will not gain money in
      Middle-earth through quests alone, but through trading with others and participating in
      the economy in any way that suits you. Middle-earth will definately be quest based
      however. While you can increase your skills through practice, you will not gain any new
      abilities based on those skills without finishing quests. If you want to learn how to make
      a new piece of armor, you will need the appropriate skill level AND be taught how to craft
      the item from a NPC. We want to provide both a free form environment for the hard-core
      players AND a more structured goal oriented environment for the casual player. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">It will also not be possible to
      be 100 times more powerful than a newbie. We are being very careful in considering all

      that a character may die if left unattended for five minutes, it's just how it is. The AI
      will be smart enough to avoid obvious danger... this means that the people who log out

      <b><i><p></i><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Westwood Studios
      Announces Nox </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Action-RPG to feature devious
      combat, detailed world</b> </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">LAS VEGAS, January 22, 1999 --
      This fall, Westwood Studios proudly invites gamers around the world to experience Nox(TM),
      a game of savage combat and sneaky tactics set in a mystical land filled with discovery
      and deceit. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">An action/role-playing game, Nox
      is the first of a new franchise for Westwood Studios, known for the 10-million selling
      Command &amp; Conquer(R) series, the Lands of Lore(R) series, and the critically acclaimed
      adaptation of Blade Runner(R). </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Nox's lightning-fast action is
      fueled by a combat system that's easy to use yet gives players tremendous gameplay depth
      and infinite possibilities. With more than 100 unique spells and weapons, players must use
      their wits to create devious combinations and tricky tactics. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">&quot;In Nox, you'll have to be
      fast, smart and it'll help to be devious,&quot; says John Hight, executive producer of
      Nox. &quot;It's not just a matter of pointing a weapon or casting a spell. It's a matter
      of thinking ahead, designing combat combinations, setting traps, playing dirty tricks and
      staying one step ahead of an opponent that's doing the same.&quot; </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The battle happens on the world
      of Nox, which game designers have filled with intricate detail. The top down viewpoint
      gives players an expansive view of the world, but there's a twist. True line of sight
      means never knowing what's around the next corner, creating an intense level of suspense. </font></small></p>

      all goes well, you should see it next weekish. Had some E-mail concerning the Japanese
      version of BG. Yes there are two different versions of BG. The Japanese (English) version
      can only be run on Japanese machines. The North American version (or any other) WILL NOT
      RUN on these machines. So if you are living in Japan, buy the Japanese version. Saw some
      of the magazine covers of BG from Europe. Cool stuff, Saravok looks so much cooler when
      the subtitle is in German ;). Put into the grinder that is the production process, the
      items for the mission pack. The icons for them are almost done and Ross and his

    <small>As always, the man with the plan, Abashi was on the boards and had the good words
    to say on everything from Guilds to why 3.5 is taking so long to dload. With that last one
    said, I would like to take the guy who asked the question and send him to Internet 101

    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">5000 people in beta currently,
      300MB to download. That's 12,288,000,000,000 bits. That's 3.16 DAYS of solid bandwidth
      usage IF they have an T3 servicing thier patch server. Or you can look at it as 1.5
      terrabytes. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">There isn't a file server on the

      over 3 days.</font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>And a bit of a mini interview here.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Simple answer to below that you
      asked, in the guild outline you (989) asked for a charter, 10 members, and a guild name. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">: I ask you what good is a
      charter if the in game reputation doesnt fit it? </font></small></p>
      <p><strong><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">They have no reputation.
      Everyone starts with a clean slate in EQ. We don't hold anyones UO actions against them.
      That's the heart of a non-biased attitude. </font></small></strong></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">:Guild name is guild name (like a
      name matters) and 10 members well I understand that but also know for a fact other guilds
      DID have the required amount of members send in the e-mail and they were NOT added.
      Strange is all to me that some were and some were not yet both filled the requirements. </font></small></p>
      <p><strong><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">It's not strange, it's
      time. And since someone just had to go post the Guild registration processes on a public
      board, the email box they set up is being inundated with hundreds of emails a day from
      people NOT in game currently. People are even sending &quot;I did not get my code&quot;
      messages to that email address. </font></small></strong></p>
      <p><strong><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">This isn't final yet,
      this is beta, and hence not all of the infrastructure is in place yet to handle this.
      Please give it time. </font></small></strong></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">: That should answer the question
      on what I meant by favortism, not saying any of the guilds that did get in shouldnt have,
      am saying ALL the guilds that met the requirments SHOULD have. </font></small></p>
      <p><strong><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Favoritism means &quot;I
      like so and so so I'm going to do special things for him&quot;. This does not occur in any
      way shape or form in Everquest.</font></small></strong></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>And a bit on Roleplaying.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Ok, I'll buy the
      &quot;chance&quot; terminology, although there is no way to know for certain if the other
      Guilds met the requirements. First, the GL must email, then each Guild member must email.
      The review process doesn't even begin until all of these have taken place. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">As far as in-game reps go, we
      cannot force anyone to roleplay. We can certainly give them the tools and every
      opportunity to roleplay (like by requiring the charter), but we cannot force them to
      follow it. I'd personally like to see some Guild faction effects go in, but I'm not sure
      that would be feasible. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">We do try and provide an
      environment that is conducive to roleplaying. In fact, even the Guides roleplay when met
      in person (as opposed to a /tell about a bug or some such thing). GM crafted quests will
      often require some roleplaying to a certain extent, and even the PvP rules promote one to
      PK in character. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">We make every attempt to promote
      it, and it is working to a certain extent. I can't tell you how many people I've seen
      roleplaying that were the ones flaming roleplayers on these boards some time back.</font></small></p>

      3.5 files if they so choose (and have the bandwidth and time) to help us get very ready

      <i><p></i><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">To understand the story
      behind Septerra Core, you must first get acquainted with the geography of the planet. The
      planet has seven continents that lie in concentric layers over top of one another, like
      the layers of an onion. The richest people, known as the Chosen, live on the top layer and
      consume massive quantities of resources and energy and dump refuse on to the lower
      continents. You play the role of Maya, a junk scavenger who lives on the layer immediately
      below the outer continent and you make a living by gathering the most useful refuse to
      sell. The Chosen have recently discovered artifacts that lead them to believe the answer
      to their past lies somewhere deep in the core of the planet, so they mobilize toward the
      center and down through the layers and countries that lie in their path. While the Chosen
      move down into the lower levels, the nations of the under continents grow restless in
      fear, and war seems imminent. As Maya, it is your destiny to make your own quest to the
      core of the planet amid all the chaos and discover the secrets that lie within. You'll
      find that the layers of the planet are actually a big puzzle and it must be solved by
      moving the continents around into place. If this is not done, the world is doomed, but if
      the continents move to solve the puzzle and unlock the secret, then great destruction will
      ensue anyway. </font></small></p>

      AD&amp;D's combat, which is really the core of the game, works exceptionally well,
      modeling dozens of weapons and the 100+ included spells in the game in a manner that
      provides visceral, immediate feedback, is visually appealing and eminently controllable,
      since you can pause the action at any time to issue new orders to your characters. Almost
      all of the monsters, spells and magic items, and even some of the locations and characters
      in the game are taken straight out the core AD&amp;D source books and related lore. Even
      though BioWare took some liberties with the AD&amp;D rules in the interest of game
      balance, as the number of spells available to certain Mage specialty classes was
      increased, for example, and the abilities of Paladins and Rangers were tweaked, only an

      area to be sure they haven't missed any potential quests, and he wants to avoid that in
      the future. &quot;I have even missed some quests that I have forgotten about because I
      didn't search an area thoroughly,&quot; he said.</font></small><font color="#ffffff"></p>

    some &quot;under the counter&quot; from <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>a recent shipment of

            for me to do? Kick in some Baldur's Gate damnit! Everquest is incredibly addicting yes,
            Tribes also has that same quality. BG does the same in all respects. All I know is that
            these 3 games alone will keep my gaming needs filled to the brim for some time to come.
            Before Christmas I was incredibly hyped for this stuff to come and now that it's here all
            I can say is that they all meet and exceed their expectations.</small></small></font></p>
