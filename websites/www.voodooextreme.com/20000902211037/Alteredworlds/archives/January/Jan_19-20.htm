    <small>Yeah I know there is nothing worse than a slow server and this one seems to be
    slower than a Porn star in a spelling contest. Anyway, I would have updates up but I have
    one small problem again...phase 3.5 of Everquest has been released and my god does it look
    good! You guys are going to love EQ Phase 4 when it hits I can promise that. <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>The textures have been improved</strong></font>, new areas added,
    new paths added, a few of the bugs have been fixed, just about everything looks great in
    Phase 3.5. If I were extremely impressed with Phase 3 then 3.5 is the shit. Although I did
    notice a swimming Orc today outside of Crushbone...and he wasn't even in the water. Now
    either that is a talented Orc or it's a bug. I went with the later on that one. Anyway,
    expect updates to kick back in later tonight or early tomorrow again. Don't worry I didn't
    forget you. </small></p>

    <small>Sorry about yesterday gang. The Internic took it's time to come around and AW was
    stuck in limbo on the new server. Looks like the new server is humming like a professional
    Ho. (not that Lewsinsky sloppy job that we were on) Anyway, news is slow this morning but
    should pick up later. I am dloading Everquest Beta 3.5 right now and the thing is going
    slower than an 80 year old in a Chevy. Not to mention i'm riding the fat pipe right now.
    That means Sony's servers are taking it in the rear at the moment. Oh well, <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>only 260 more megs to go and i'll be there</strong></font>. The
    funny thing is, the fat pipe is so fat that I tried to play a little Tribes while
    downloading this fat mofo and still got not one hitch in a game of CTF. As for the second
    part to the EQ Editorial I promised earlier, well i'm working on that too, just waiting on
    some word from up-top to let it loose.</small></p>

      knew that KQ8 was going to be my next game. Going from 2d to 3d is a natural progression.
      Since I've been working on adventure games (early 80's), I have wanted to create true 3d
      adventure games...the only problem was that until very recently, computers haven't been
      powerful enough to create 3d worlds which were both responsive and beautiful. Since
      adventure games are, at their core, interactive stories, detail and beauty of a world is
      very important, and computers just weren't capable of creating detailed, beautiful 3d
      worlds until the last year or so. Now they are...and I'm very glad that adventure games
      will now be able to 'come into their' own in 3d from now on. Once you have experienced an
      adventure game in 3d-it's very difficult to go back! </font></small></p>

    <p><small>By the way, his first question is totally true. I like the fact that you can
    actually get knocked into a bad wet dream before your impending death. Makes it that much
    more dramatic with you sitting there staring on in horror as a few Orcs get medevil on
    your unconcious ass. I've actually been able to escape this too...where someone would come
    along and help right after I got knocked out, so I got up and ran like a one legged
    Halfling. Anyway, here's a bit on Quests.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Quests provide a nice diversion.
      If you are in the area of Freeport, Rivervale, Erudin, and espicially Qeynos, there are a
      lot of quests. For instantance, in Qeynos, virtually every named NPC has or is part of a
      quest. Some quests require further killing, some require travel, and others escorting.
      There is even a spy mission or two. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Trade skills will also provide a
      nice diversion, as you can't exactly run around killing while working on your skills and
      selling your wares. Well, i suppose you can, but at least its something else. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">And hey! If all else fails you
      could try socializing :)</font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>Even more on quests etc.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">As a powergamer, one thing you
      will want to keep in mind is that the best items in the game will come through questing. I
      hear powergamers like toys :) </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">As for the quests, steps are
      being taken now to make sure that people don't feel like they are playing &quot;Guess the
      magic keyword&quot; like in UO. They are already far more indepth, but some people still
      find it hard to figure out what to ask the NPCs. One thing to keep in mind is that you
      must speak in complete properly punctuated sentences. One thing you do is actually read
      what they say, the thing you ask must be in thier text. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">For instance, if you say hello to
      an NPC and they start complaining about the Pirates of Katharg, you might try asking
      &quot;Who are the Pirates of Katharg?&quot;. Just saying &quot;Pirates of Katharg?&quot;
      will usually not work. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Just remember the 5 W's and H.
      Who, what, when, where, why, and how. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Who are the Pirates of Katharg?<br>
      What do the Pirates of Katharg want from you?<br>
      When will the Pirates of Katharg attack?<br>
      Where can I find the Katharg of Gunthak?<br>
      Why are the Pirates of Katharg killing your people?<br>
      How do I defeat the Pirates of Katharg?</font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>Here's another important little feature you'll notice about EQ when you first
    start playing.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"><small>No, you cannot see how many
      hitpoints, but you can see a health bar. The health bar purposefully lags behind the hit
      to show impact to simulate the amount of time that a large hit might take to show damage.
      For instance, if you hit a creature with 100 HP's for 50, it might take 2 or 3 seconds for
      the bar to start moving, and another 2 or 3 seconds for it to get down to 50%.<small> </small>It
      really makes your heart leap up into your throat the first time you take on that new and
      dangerous looking critter and hit it 3 times for all you are worth before you see it's
      healthbar move :)</small></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>Here's an even more interesting bit on racial balances in the game.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">No dual wield. Also, dwarves
      aren't as liked by the other races as say, a human. Not to mention, due to the racial
      advantages of being a dwarf (e.g. infravision, sense heading bonus, Strength and Stam),
      you can expect a sizable experience penalty for playing one, and your agility is lower. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">However, one thing I would like
      ot stress is that STATS are not the be all and end all. Stats are the LAST modifier used
      to determine the stregth of a hit, the amount of mana, etc. First is skill, followed by
      level (which are closely intertwined). </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Then take into account that
      people will gravitite to magic items that improve thier stats as a character. For
      instance, dwarves will not be as interested in items that raise strength as those that
      raise agility. Humans will be more interested in strength. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">That's the purpose of balance. A
      wood elf warrior is no worse a warrior than an ogre warrior. Even at 50th level, I'd
      expect naked fight between the two, tactics not withstanding, to go even. Sure, the ogre
      is stronger by far, but the elf is much more agile (harder to hit) and dexterous (has
      better control of thier blade) than the ogre. It all balances out. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">-Abashi, Everquest Guide </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">P.S. I try to convince people of
      this daily, they never buy it. Of course, not everyone else has taken classes of differnet
      races and matched them up like that before.</font></small></p>

      completed and approved. The clipping has been started and other data entry has begun. All
      in all it&#146;s more than on schedule. The quality level for the mission pack is amazing.
      We actually had to &quot;dummy down&quot; some of the art because it looked &quot;too
      good&quot;. BG2 is going to look soooo good. I think everyone will want to play this
