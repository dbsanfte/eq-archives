      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Combat includes 4
      basic modes. We have weapon based combat, hand to hand combat, bow combat, and stealth
      mode. Weapon mode features three basic attacks: a thrust, a swing, and a chop. As you gain
      experience you can learn variations off of these base attacks. These variations will
      eventually lead to chain attacks that link moves together in a multiple hit attack
      combination. In certain situations, an interactive move can be performed. Interactive
      moves include fatalities, throws, and power moves. These are not reserved for the player
      alone however. Expect monsters to pick you up by the head and throw you, punch you in the
      face and send you flying head over heels; even pick you up and powerbomb you. Did we just
      say pro-wrestling moves in an RPG? You're damn right we did. Hand to hand mode works much
      like weapon mode with the 3 basic attacks being punch, thrust kick, and jumping sidekick.
      Variations can be learned like the uppercuts and spin kicks. Interactives and combinations
      are also included for some serious martial arts combat. </font></small></p>

    some non-rpg stuff. First, <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>get your ass up off the couch</strong></font>
    and go buy a SoundBlaster Live! Card!!! Wow! I don't normally get all hyped about sound
    hardware, but after listening to Sacrates whoop and holler, I picked one up. Wow! (Did I
    say that already :)). Very sweet. Second, I thought I'd throw together a list from our
    readers of the <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Top 10 Things They Want From Santa</strong></font>
    this year. It doesn't absolutely have to be RPG based, but it would help. You also get

    gone to the pre-order site for Baldur's Gate? It might be just me, but isn't 70 some odd
    dollars american a bit steep for a game!?!? I mean, that's like $110 canadian!!!! Ah well,

      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Small update: things
      are going ok. There are a few remaining bugs being worked on in the multiplayer code - we
      want to make sure that people don't get arbitrarily dropped out of the game because of a
      strange problem with packet loss that has appeared in the past few days (that would be bad
      :) - and a few remaining bugs in some of the more complex single player scripts - we want
      to make sure that these are really solid. We're also still awaiting a few final sound
      tracks for some of the movies, which are supposed to be here early next week (after which
      we prepare our next release candidate).<br>
      <br>
      If anyone's interested, I just finished the game for the second time (the first person in
      the world to have finished the entire game twice, start to finish). This time I tried to
      do everything - visited every area, tried to explore as many dialogue options as possible.
      It took me 189 game days (a game day is about 2 hours real time, but this figure also
      includes time spent resting, which takes a third of a day each time you rest) to see
      everything. This took about 160-170 hours of actual game play (last time I spent maybe 100
      hours, since I did fewer side quests). I reached the XP cap of 89,000 XP about 140 hours
      into the game, while in chapter 6. It wasn't very easy to reach - you have to do a LOT of
      the subquests to reach it.<br>
      <br>
      I'm pretty comfortable saying (from personal experience) that I think the game is really
      good now.<br>
      <br>
      Now I start the game again (well, at least part of it - doubt if I will be able to finish
      it a third time before we release it) Yee-haw!</font></small></p>

      Farmageddon&quot; </p>
      <p>It was prophesied long ago, and perserved in ancient grimoires, that a terrible war
      would be waged in a distant and transient land. The prophecy speaks of beasts, consumed by
      the spirits of demons, that will rise up against each other, and leave a trail of
      destruction so deep and wide that none shall be left unscathed; the massacre shall be
      total. </p>
      <p>The scholars have interpreted that for a few short days, the war cycle will begin and
      end over and over again, like waves that ceaselessly beat upon the sand. All souls who
      dare will be afforded the opportunity to participate in this dangerous dance, as the cycle
      will begin anew with great frequency. </p>
      <p>All who choose to gather into this place shall go by way of the five great cities and
      then their fates will be known, as is detailed in the following rhyme: </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Those who go by way of Yew shall be seen as swine.<br>
        And those from out of Trinsic come, now become bovine.<br>

    wacky canucks are a month ahead of you guys on the ham &amp; cranberries scene, so who
    knows :)). Anyways, best wishes to everyone on the holidays...</small></p>

    <small>Well you gotta admit, when Interplay finally gets the ball rolling, it <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>takes off doing mach 10</strong></font>. Feargus was on the
    official site to announce a new patch for Fallout 2 (v1.02...yah I know, that's the same
    number as the last one, Who ever said programmers can count :)).</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"><small>Located in the Files
      section and at <a href="http://www.interplay.com/fallout2/files.html" target="main">this
      link</a>, is a new version of the Fallout 2 BETA 1.02 Patch. It is still a BETA patch
      though, so it has not finished going through our QA department. </p>
      <p>It should be a lot more stable then the last one, and fix a bunch of little things. </p>
      <p>We are a little concerned about Save Games between this and the previous BETA patch,
      only if the Save Game you are trying to load is corrupted. We aren't 100% able to
      determine if a Save Game is corrupted when it is being loaded. So don't try to open a
      Saved Game that was previously corrupted. I know that sounds a little lame, but I wanted
      everyone to have that information. </p>
      <p>Thanks again for the awesome E-mails you have all been sending, </p>
      <p>Have a Happy Thanksgiving, </p>
      <p>-Feargus (<a href="mailto:furquhart@interplay.com">furquhart@interplay.com</a>) </p>
      <p>PS - The patch version is listed as 1.02, which is the same as the first patch. This is
      correct. The patch version listed on this web site previously was wrong. Rest assured that
      this -is- the latest patch for the game. </small></font></p>
