      <b><i><p></i><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Westwood Studios
      Unveils Swords &amp; Sorcery </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Epic Role Playing Game from RPG
      Legend D.W. Bradley Due in 1999</b> </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">LAS VEGAS, NV, Dec. 22, 1998 --
      Westwood Studios proudly announces Swords &amp; Sorcery: Come Devils, Come Darkness(tm),
      an epic new Role Playing Game from legendary RPG designer D. W. Bradley. Sword &amp;
      Sorcery is the first game from Bradley's new development company, Heuristic Park, and the
      first to place his distinctive visions in a 3D world. Gamers will be able to explore the
      worlds of Sword and Sorcery when the CD-ROM game ships in the summer of 1999. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Swords and Sorcery is a classic
      RPG complete with statistics, spell casting and character classes. Players will be able to
      build parties of up to six characters, choosing from 10 races - from humans and fantasy
      staples such as Elves and Dwarves to a feline race and an elephantine race. The game's 15
      character classes range from Warrior to Monk. The player assigns skills and attributes
      from the numerous characteristics available to them. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">&quot;This is the game I've
      always wanted to make,&quot; said Bradley, the creative force behind Sir Tech's Wizardry
      V, VI and VII. &quot;With Swords &amp; Sorcery, we're giving players an amazing amount of
      freedom with character development, control, viewpoint and combat. The result, I think,
      will be as pure an RPG experience as you can have without a bag full of 12-sided
      dice.&quot; </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Swords and Sorcery can be played
      from both third and first person perspectives, and from the point of view of any member of
      the player's party. This gives the player more choices whether in combat or solving
      puzzles. Characters can also be grouped together to multi-task on separate objectives
      simultaneously, in separate locations. Combat takes place in phased turns. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">For the first time in an RPG,
      characters have full continuity between single and multiplayer games, allowing them to be
      transferred between the two play modes with their statistics, abilities and inventories
      intact. Multiplay will be over Westwood Online, an online gaming service with more than a
      million members. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The game's grand quest spans
      three distinctive environments, each consisting of four regions, which make up the world
      of Gael-Serran. This land is under threat from the evil High Priest Cet Ude D'ua Khan, who
      is planning to rise up and conquer all, following his awakening from an entombed sleep.
      Only the Staff of Death, which wields the power of the Black Fire, can defeat the dreaded
      Et. First, however, players must recover the legendary blessed and cursed Mavin Sword.
      Through such quests, Sword and Sorcery's sub-plots and adventures unfold into an epic RPG
      experience. </font></small></p>

    <small>Just noticed over at BG Chronicles, all things BG, that Greg was on IRC and had a
    few things to say on shipping etc. Let's just say your..............this close to getting
    this bastard. <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Tomorrow is looking like a clean guess</strong></font>.</small></p>
    <font color="#e3cead"><blockquote>
      <p></font><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">[Big_Tuna] not sure what
      to say<br>
      [Big_Tuna] talked to our Chief Operations Officer about shipments<br>
      [Big_Tuna] he said everything is going right on schedule<br>
      [Big_Tuna] pre-orders were picked up by Digital River yesterday<br>
      [Big_Tuna] they picked up an extra 1,000 units just to be safe<br>
      [Big_Tuna] so they should be going out as we sit here...<br>
      [Big_Tuna] though I need to talk to Digital River to confirm that<br>
      [Big_Tuna] the rest of the orders are going out as well<br>
      [Big_Tuna] I don't know who is getting what when<br>
      [Big_Tuna] except that EB and Software Etc<br>
      [Big_Tuna] are top of the list<br>
      [Big_Tuna] because of a special express freight program they have<br>
      [Big_Tuna] One of the problems we have been having is that the game is selling out<br>
      [Big_Tuna] before it hits the shelves<br>
      [Big_Tuna] ordinarily you might have seen it in some stores as early as tomorrow<br>
      [Big_Tuna] but now I'm not sure<br>
      [Big_Tuna] some stores may very well say &quot;Well, we got it in, but it sold out right
      away&quot;<br>
      [Big_Tuna] I wouldn't be surprised if people bought five or six copies for their friends<br>
      [Big_Tuna] the demand for this game is getting out of hand<br>
      [Big_Tuna] (it is a great game, but man, it will still be a great game in two or three
      days...)<br>
      [Big_Tuna] If you get denied on your first visit to the store, <br>
      [Big_Tuna] you can join Silverdawn and I on Unreal multi-player<br>
      [Big_Tuna] I won't be gettting the game until after ALL of you...<br>
      [Big_Tuna] Interplay won't be receiving sample games until AFTER the total first shipment<br>
      [Big_Tuna] I called EB yesterday to see if I could beg/borrow/reserve a copy<br>
      [Big_Tuna] they laughed....<br>
      [Big_Tuna] hehe<br>
      [Big_Tuna] so looks like Unreal for me until maybe the new year ;)<br>
      [Big_Tuna] Everyone will need to tell me how things looked<br>
      [Big_Tuna] I have a beta myself - but I want to start over and play the finished version<br>
      [Big_Tuna] regardless, pass the word as best you can<br>
      [Big_Tuna] it is only a couple more days...</font></small></p>

      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The outside of
      Kaladim is tremendous, with a very large stone carving of a dwarf posed with a double
      sided battle axe. Inside Kaladim is dwarven to the core with many tunnels, low buildings,
      gemstones and an actual mine! Kaladim is currently split into northern and southern
      halves. The time to load these zones is very quick, so moving back and forth is not a
      problem. There is a bank inside Kaladim, with a lovely fire burning outside of its
      building. Once you fulfill your first quest to your specific guild, get outside! You will
      be greeted by the many denizens that inhabit the mountains. </font></small></p>

    <small>Talking about a game that has been getting some bad reception. This game is getting
    eaten up like Chocolate hidden on a Fat Farm. (Small aside: <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Ever
    wonder how a hit man would take out Richard Simmons?</strong></font> Just spray a nice
    chocalate mist on him and watch as his own fans begin to eat him alive.) Anyway,<a href="http://pc.ign.com/reviews/3671.html"> IGN.PC</a> does the bitch slappin here...so
    head on over and read up on it.</small></p>

      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Quest for Glory V's
      storyline is much as you'd expect it. The king of Silmaria has been assassinated, and the
      kingdom is in trouble. After poking around the main city a bit (and running into several
      friends from your past adventures) you'll discover that the new king is being selected by
      a process known as the Rite of Rulership. Five entries are given five great quests to
      complete and the overall winner is proclaimed king. Obviously you join in and the
      adventure begins. The quests are extremely dangerous and to make matters worse, that
      assassin is still out there trying to pick off candidates. In order to survive, you've got
      to be quick, or smart, or strong. Although the tale starts off a little hokey, if you're
      like me, it won't take but about an hour before you're sucked into the story and continue
      play simply to see what happens next. </font></small></p>

    basically the same take on it as the last one. Here's a bit from<a href="http://gamespot.com/rpg/returnto/review.html"> Gamespot's</a>.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">While Betrayal at
      Krondor was primarily a first-person-perspective game, Return to Krondor opts for a
      stylish, but occasionally disorienting, variety of third-person perspectives. Unlike the
      suddenly abundant third-person-perspective games using a &quot;trailing camera,&quot; in
      Return to Krondor the camera angles are stationary in each scene, although you can choose
      from a variety of camera views in most key encounter areas in the game. As you move your
      party through the gaming world, using either directional keys or by simply mouse-clicking
      on a targeted location, you prompt automatic shifts in the game's camera perspective. The
      frequently shifting camera perspectives is often disorienting, since clicking on a
      location at the top of your screen regularly results in your characters actually moving
      towards the bottom of the screen after an involuntary camera switch. In the vast majority
      of outdoor locations, you can't readily switch back to a previous perspective, making it
      easy to initially lose orientation as you suddenly view the gaming world from a different
      angle. Veterans of the Alone in the Dark series or similar games are likely to adapt
      quicker to Krondor's new environment, but most gamers will require a lengthier-than-usual
      period of time to adapt to the game's controls.</font></small></p>
