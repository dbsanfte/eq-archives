    With that said, we end the Everquest Fast today. Brad (Spawn of Satan) never sent us one

    suspect it will start around late December, unless of course they have already duplicated
    a bunch of Beta CD's for shipping? Then I would say mid December possibly. Really depends
    on how bad the Beta 3 guys screw it up. Hopefully you'll see us wondering the lands of
    Norath soon enough in our elusive search for those naked, big breasted Elven women at play
    in a waterfall.</small><br>

      once Laura finishes the schemas. She has got about 50 or so done all ready which is marked
      in the Database. This week I will finish the priority 1 &amp; 2 motions that remain. I
      will be working out a schedule for Joe listing the projections as to when the motions will
      enter the game.I will be nicer to Ken Levine. </font></small></p>

      getting into System Shock workflow. Learning our editor and other technologies. I&#146;m
      almost going full speed now and have gotten my currently assigned level (Command Deck)
      roughed out. My current project is to polish Command into a working, playable level. After
      that&#146;s done, I will move onto the final level of the game. In my spare time (ya
      right!) I have been working on a total overhaul of my website and for those interested in
      Game/Level Design should stop by (www.skarz.com). I hope to have some articles about level
      and game design written soon by myself, Matt (another level designer on SS2), and other
      people. Have a good one! </font></small></p>

      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Robert Fermier I've been
      reworking the interface in line with some new interface conventions, to streamline it and
      to make the system more flexible for reconfiguration. Also putting the finishing touches
      on some game systems like radiation, biohazard, energy stations, and the like. In the next
      few weeks we're going to be re-integrating our code base with the great stuff the guys
      over on Thief have been doing, now that they are basically done. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Mark Waks Worked on the details
      of avatars: getting players to look reasonable on each others' machines. This included
      fixing up physics models so that avatars work much like players, and adding
      &quot;smoothing&quot; code so that discrepancies between projected and actual player
      movement looks natural. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Jon Chey The last 3 weeks have
      been mainly concerned with integrating our new monster models and motion captures. We now
      have at least 400 motions that are to be used for cut-scenes &amp; in game-animations as
      well as plenty of scary monsters. As well, we now have the majority of the weapons in the
      game and are waiting for the artists to generate effects. The weapons range from your
      standard military issue items to a variety of more exotic high-tech items &amp; other
      pieces that must remain a secret for now. Most of my work over the next couple of weeks
      will be co-ordinating the continuing integration of these resources and writing any custom
      AI or effects code that is required. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Mike Rowley We just finished our
      initial version of networking for the dark engine. It is designed to send as little
      information as possible in order to keep the machines in synch. When we know that all the
      machines will simulate the same high level behavior in the same way, we don't send low
      level events for it. This should keep the bandwidth requirement very low. There are still
      a lot of bugs and known efficiency problems, but it is now basically playable with
      multiple players. </font></small></p>

    <small>Thought I would let you guys know that I am now Officially impressed with Zelda.
    Miyamato does it again it seems. The graphics are excellent for an <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>inferior
    machine like the N64</strong></font> yet still do a great job of grabbing your attention
    and putting you in the environment. The scope of this game seems immense and I look
    forward to exploring more of it soon. Now there are two games that I have seen so far that
    have amazing game design and playability and that's Zelda and Half Life. If your into
    RPG's then this game can't be passed by, it's by all standards an instant classic.
    Ugh..sorry this came off like a CNN style post but this game deserves a solid compliment
    even though i'm not a console gamer. Hey, had to jerk the console monkey in me sometime.</small></p>

    EQ posters done by none other than Kieth Parkinson. Although it doesn't have naked big

    Sacrates</small></a><br>
    <small>Noticed over at Lorien's Love Shack (Gagames) That Vircom has made an update to the
    <a href="http://www.the4thcoming.com/">4th Coming page </a>on the beta release etc. I took
    a look at this game and the graphics don't look bad at all. Are there<font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>
    any chimps out there playing this at the moment</strong></font>? I would like to get a
    little feedback on that.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">After carefully studying the
      feedback we've been receiving from both licensees and players, we've decided to stagger
      our release process into two stages. The first stage, called Base Release, is immiment and
      will feature the game in its actual stages, with few modifications and increased
      stability. The second stage, called Official Release, is scheduled at some point in the
      future (date to be determined) and will include several additional features which could
      not be included in the Base Release. These features tentatively include: the female puppet
      (actually, that one's certain and urgent), a chat box (with full scrollback/recall), a
      secure trading box, character shadows, additional skills, spells, NPCs &amp; items, a
      *lot* more space to play in, etc. Even after the Official Release, however, you can expect
      more improvements on the game. Unlike standard &quot;commercial&quot; games, T4C is and
      will always be a work in progress. We will constantly improve it to keep everyone's
      interest alive. So the Base Release is the first of many release stages and you can expect
      that we'll add as much stuff as possible to the game, as soon as possible. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">When the Base Release occurs,
      that will mean there will be a good number of T4C servers outside of Vircom's and the few
      existing beta servers currently available. At that point, you will have to contact the one
      nearest you (we'll give you their locations on a world map) and check out how much they
      charge for their service. Vircom does not interfere with its licensees in this regard. </font></small><i></p>

      the depth (an intricate storyline with over 100 sub-plots), the epic size (a 10,000-screen
      area to adventure in), the character interaction and, with hundreds of weapons, spells,
      items and monsters, a lot to get to grips with.</font></small></p>

    <small>It's always good to be getting the goods on Diablo 2 kiddies since it and UO are
    the two reasons AW is here now. Looks like IGN.PC have kicked up an <a href="http://pc.ign.com/news/5979.html">Interview with Bill Roper</a>. He had a few
    particularly interesting tidbits including info on Guild Houses and Halls. <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Getcher ass over there now</strong></font> and read up.</small></p>

    <blockquote>
      <i><p></i><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Sound is also an important
      element. Not only can guards see the thief, they can hear him. Different surfaces make
      different amounts of noise. As the thief, the player can walk softly over resonant
      surfaces like metal plating and move swiftly over carpeted floors. Of course, sound works
      both ways; aspiring thieves can also hear the guards come and whip out the black jack.
      Thief has perhaps one of the best implementations of hardware accelerated sound design.
      Players will definitely want one of the many DirectSound3D cards to get the most out of
      the game. </font></small></p>

    <small>Woohoo, the full reviews are coming in on this bad boy. As soon as our copy arrives
    here at AW you can be sure we'll be <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>smackin this bastard on
    the ass</strong></font> too. Gamespot is<a href="http://gamespot.com/action/thief/review.html"> dishin out some lovin</a>...check it.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p></i><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">You'll quickly learn to
      love the darkness in Thief, even if that darkness makes everything look a little dreary.
      At other times you'll find some wall textures that are a little too loud, while some of
      the level architecture feels a bit too plain. But those moments are the exception: For the
      most part, the environments in Thief are enormous, fantastic, and yet plausible. Ruined
      cities, lost temples, gaudy mansions, almost-high-tech factories, foreboding cathedrals
      and much more help maintain a cohesive and creative visual design. And with its smooth
      frame rate, subtly beautiful lighting effects, and a host of foes whose movements are
      startlingly lifelike thanks to motion capture, Thief's look will quickly grow on you. </font></small></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Redguard has truly lived up to
      its billing. It is a unique role play adventure game that combines a great storyline with
      good graphics and excellent CD quality sound and music. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The games main storyline puts the
      gamer in the role of Cyrus, a man who is searching for his lost sister. Although this may
      not sound like much of a story, it is. There are many plots and subplots that develop and
      reveal themselves throughout the game and there are a number of diverse and interesting
      characters. You are also challenged by various different puzzles which vary in difficulty.

    <font color="#ffffff" face="Arial" size="2"><blockquote>
      <p></font><font size="2" color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Graphically, Thief isn't
      quite on par with games like <b>Unreal</b> or <b>Half-Life</b>. The 3D Dark Engine that
      the game uses seems to emphasize gameplay functionality over lens flare and distracting
      lighting effects. Although the game does still look good, it's actually a nice change to
      see developers putting new control methods into an engine before throwing in effects that
      only hardware manufactures and the most vehement fans of eye-candy demand</font></p>
