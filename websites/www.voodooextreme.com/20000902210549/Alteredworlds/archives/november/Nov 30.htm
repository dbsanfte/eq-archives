    <small>Niel Yates has been missing from the Wizardry boards for a while. Hmm, those Crack
    habits are hard to break,<font color="#FFFFFF"><strong> I bet the rehab took away his
    Donnie and Marie records</strong></font>. Anyway, he was on the boards all cleaned up and
    had a few words to say. First bit is on overall development.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Couldn't have said it better!
      Wiz8 will be by far the best Wizardry yet. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">It never ceases to amaze me - the
      graphics are phenomenal - reminds me of Unreal and Half-Life, but blend-in a great
      storyline &amp; plot. The release may be 'far away', but that can only really mean one
      thing - it's a big title with an intricate storyline and complex levels - a huge
      programming undertaking, let alone designing/animating/level-building. Unreal and
      Half-Life took over 3 years each to create. Heretic II didn't take much time, but it's a
      'so-so' title with fairly backwards graphical effects. I don't like to bash other people's
      work, but Heretic II is, in my opinion, not that great. I think by the time Wiz8 releases,
      most people should have the hardware to enjoy it. Take that as a subtle hint :-) </font></small></p>

    <p><small>The next bit is on what programming language they are using on Wizardry.</small></p>

    <small>Go Lorien! <a href="http://www.gagames.com">Gamer's Alliance</a> just threw up a
    review of the <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>spiffy new 3D RPG</strong></font> Return to
    Krondor. It's a good review, with some fantastic screenshots. Kinda shoots down parts of
    the game though. Ah well, I'll give you the AW scoop on the game as soon as it hits stores
    here in Canada.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The story keeps you interested,
      even if it is fairly linear. Basically, as Jimmy the Hand you and your party are out to
      find a lost and ancient artifact known as the Tear of the Gods (that belongs to the
      Ishapian Church). Along the way you&#146;ll run into a hulk of a man named Bear, who is
      also desperately seeking the Tear for an evil magician name Sidi. Your job is to grab the
      Tear before Bear and his pirate friends do. Along the way you&#146;ll run into a large
      cast of characters with a wide range of personalities. This plot is very run-of-the-mill
      to me and the only thing that makes it enjoyable is the variety shown in the citizens of
      Krondor.</font></small></p>

    <small>Greg Peterson was making the rounds on the Baldur's Gate message boards. Damn,
    enough with teasing us already, <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>just release the damn thing</strong></font>

    <blockquote>

      until after the initial game is done.<br>
      <br>
      Yes work has been done, but we want everyone to understand that right now we are focused
      against getting the first game cleaned up and out the door. Discussions about the
      expansion(s) will just get people into a frenzy.<br>
      <br>
      Of course, if people want to post ideas for expansions, this is the area to do so...</font></small></p>

    <p><small>He then looks at previous knowledge of the Forgotten Realms, and what impact it
    will have on your BG experience...</p>
    </small><blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Maybe yes... maybe no.<br>
      <br>
      Baldur's Gate is consistent with everything you have read, so you will definitely be able
      to jump into the game more quickly. You will also have a better handle on the various
      political factions and power groups - these play an important role throughout the game
      (since they play an important role in the lives of everyone on the Sword Coast).<br>
      <br>
      I don't think it will give you an advantage, per se, but I think it WILL allow you to get
      even more enjoyment out of it...</font></small></p>

    the recent beta.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p></i><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Well, I asked the beta
      testers to respond with their initial impressions of the game, and I only got 4 reponses
      (between day before Thanksgiving and now). Of course, they SHOULD all be playing 12 hours
      per day (hehe) so they may not even be checking emails. We just got a weekend update from
      Ray which we will be posting on the homepage as soon as the web team gets in... but here
      are the verbatim responses from the 4 beta-testers (in no order) </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">#1: THIS GAME ROCKS!!!! The
      interface is very easy to use. The character creation is a great, streamlined version of
      the p&amp;p game. I've spent many hours making and remaking characters and totally loved
      doing it. I haven't found many bugs yet. Most of the glitches I've run into I have not
      been able to reproduce. The only one that has been consistant is that female Gnomes appear
      onscreen with male bodies complete with beard. ;^) I'm saving alot just in case, but I do
      that with any game. The gameplay is also very intuitive and easy to learn. The initial
      town with it's green garbed tutors helped alot. My biggest surprise so far has been how
      funny this game is. Many of the npc's have great lines. And the characters you can add to
      your party are hilarious. They have so much personality and style. Also, the fact that
      characters of opposing alignment will bicker and even fight one another is a terrific
      feature, too. So far, it's everything I've expected (after following the development for
      almost a year) and more. I'd place Baldur's Gate in my top three CRPG's of all time, and
      if you take away the nostalgic value of Wizardry 7 and Betrayal at Krondor, this would
      win. Did I mention this game ROCKS?! ;^) </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">#2: Greg, here is my initial
      reaction: AWESOME! The game is gorgeous, plain and simple. The music is beautiful and sets
      the mood perfectly. Game play is very intuitive and every button has roll-over help. Even
      without the manual most things are easy to figure out. I have not come across many bugs,
      mainly issues with my video card, so the game is also very stable. All in all, I am very
      impressed. It is definitely one of the best CRPG's I have ever played. Its actually much
      better than I expected. I am not a great fan of AD&amp;D, but this is a great
      implementation of the rules. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">#3: It's like Pringles. Once you
      start, you can't stop. :) One thing that surprised me is the speed of the game. I have an
      old Matrox Millenium One vidcard so I am unable to make use of the accelerated features of
      the game. However, the game still runs at a very playable rate. I can't wait to get a REAL
      video card and see what this puppy is like. I was also delighted when we (the beta
      testers) were told to submit bugs as well as SUGGESTIONS. It really shows that you guys
      care about our opinions. The interface is intuitive enough that no manual is necessary,
      yet complete enough so that I can do everything I would want to in the game. Even if I get
      a manual, I doubt I'll be reading it. The look and feel of the game is wonderful. The
      characters in the game are so lively that I never feel like I'm the only player in the
      game world. I even had a an internal squabble between party members once which really
      surprised me. It's that type of attention to detail and realism that help to immerse me
      into the game. The bugs I'm running into are not that bad. Most of the problems I was
      having were due to my video card (matrox millenium I). Very few of the bugs I've run into
      are technical things. Most of them have to do with characters not doing the right thing,
      such as saying they will take me somewhere and then not going. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">#4: My initial impression is that
      the game is fantastic. I am amazed by the sheer beauty of the game. I also am impressed my
      the quick load times. I love the music. It is very easy to become quickly immersed in the
      game. I, also am very happy to see how easy it is to move around to the game. I,
      unfortunately, have found some bugs, which I hope get ironed out. I have been looking
      foward to this game for a long time, and I want the public perception to be that it is the
      best game of the year and the best RPG of all time. This is selfish on my part because I
      want there to be no problem in producing future sequels. Although, the game can be played
      without a manual (obviously, because I'm doing it), one would have been very helpful.
      Things such as character creation and alignment are fun to read, but not necessary to the
      play of the game. I have some D&amp;D stuff anyway. However, a manuel is really needed to
      discuss fighting options, scripting, pausing the game to give orders, and using items,
      casting spells etc. I'm still not sure that I am doing things the optimum way. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">FYI... none of the testers is
      close to finishing the game. If I hear anything from our other testers I will send out an
      update. I may recheck with them by the end of the week to see how things are going... </font></small></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">I finished the
      training, and began the 1 mission available in the game. There is a 1-page description of
      the mission, with a recommended method to complete it. Your mission is to steal a valuable
      sceptre from a noble's mansion. Then, you are brought to a screen showing what items you
      have available for the mission, and what items are available for purchase. I am guessing
      that in the full game, you will have to steal money in order to buy these tools. Once you
      have picked your equipment, and gone over your objectives, the game loads. I won't
      describe the entire mission and spoil it for others, but I will tell you that getting
      involved in a melee struggle is almost always a bad idea, as you are a thief and not much
      of a fighter. The focus is more on hiding in the shadows until a guard walks by you, and

    <small>Ah, about time we got a little U:A goodness coming our way. As usual <a href="http://www.walrus.com/~sith/">Sith</a> was on the stick again and dug up some
    goodness off the boards <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>posted by none other than the Lord

    in the title.</small></p>

      companies, there is a separation between development and marketing. In the past, I have
      wavered on my position of having the IX or not. At this point, I am clearly in favor of
      putting the IX back in. However, even I must convince the publishing group. In companies
      everyone has there job, and marketing gets the final call here. I am however a very
      persuasive person... We'll see</font></small></p>

      not even know there would be a next and their plots have been forced together later. On
      the second trilogy, I at least started off with where the last one ended. With U7-9 I did
      at least plan a few of the basics around the Guardian, the main goals and where the game
      would take place, not much more. And for Ultima's beyond IX, only a short wish list of
      technical issues I'd like to see us accomplish, nothing yet about the plot.</font></small></p>

    <small>Ken Levine was on the boards again talking about Level design and how big the
    levels are going to be. He also has a little word in there for Half Life too. If this game
    is <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>anywhere near as good as Thief </strong></font>is then
    Looking Glass has the double whammy on their hands. Although SS won't be around for a
    little while yet. Here some info on that mofo to keep you jazzed up.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Our levels are much
      larger and much more discrete than Half life's (which is, btw, a wonderful game). They
      break down their levels so you might come across a new one every 4-5 MINUTES. They pretty
      much had to do the shooting across the levels thing or their game really wouldn't work. We
      introduce a new level every few hours, so it's really not an issue. </font></small></p>

    <small>I'm not hip to posting too much stuff on Half Life here. (Yeah right) but with this
    little <a href="http://www.gameslice.com/editorial/1130hl.shtml">Editorial</a> made by
    Geoff Keighly the Editor in Chief over at Gameslice I thought I should. It's a good read
    and gives you a good idea why you want this game if you haven't gotten it yet. Anyway, as
    you know, my posts may or may not be sporadic this week so keep that in that chimp mind of
    yours. Also Billy totally hit the spot (In more ways than one) in his Blah yesterday. I
    too can remember the exact moment<font color="#FFFFFF"><strong> I scratched my ass
    yesterday</strong></font>. Although while he had to use his entire hand, I deftly did the
    two finger twitch and caught that itch unawares. It was a dead day yesterday no doubt.
    Keep your eyes peeled though as i'm sure it should pick up later today. </small></p>
