    <small>This is something that i'm sure has got a few Phase 3er's Undies up their milky
    whites. Personally I wasn't planning on playing my old character anyway since I have a few
    friends coming in on 4 and it just isn't worth it to Party up a level 12 with a Level 1.
    Anyway, here's the word <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>straight from the Horses Ass</strong></font>

      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">There will be a player wipe prior
      to the beginning of Phase Four. This pwipe will occur at midnight P.S.T. on the 7th of
      February. All players may register one character for reimbursement. The source of this
      character, be it the 3.0 or the 3.5 server, does not matter. However, it is one character
      per account, not one character per server. In order to register your character you must
      use the /feedback command while in game with the character that you wish to have
      reimbursed. In your feedback form you will need to enter the word &quot;RESTORE&quot; and
      a &quot;code word&quot; of your choosing. This &quot;code word&quot; can be whatever you
      choose, but you MUST give it in order to be restored. Use of this code word will allow
      players who desire to change their account name to do so. Please do not enter any other
      information into this /feedback, all your character information will be recorded
      automatically. When the time comes for you to be reimbursed, the GM will ask you for the
      account under which you registered and the code word you used. This character will be
      reimbursed once on ONE SERVER of your choosing. The maximum number of levels that will be
      reimbursed is 35. Characters of a level above 35 will be reimbursed at level 35. Monetary
      reimbursements will be given in amounts appropriate to your reimbursed level. It is
      recommended that you register your character on or before 11 P.M. P.S.T. on February 7th. </font></small></p>

    Interview</a> with Ben Smedstad of Thrust Monkey. He talked quite a bit about the success

    they have <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>a possible Multiplayer Only</strong></font>
    product in the works! Check it.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"><b>Despite the success of Baldurs
      Gate, some opinions feel that there could have been more done with the multi-player
      aspects. Certainly Baldurs is an epic single-player experience, and the designers have
      allowed you to play with your friends, and was never intended as an open online game such
      as Everquest. Any news you want to break to Gamer's Alliance on a possible integration of
      Baldurs Gate with some form of persistent online world? For some reason, this type of
      interface integrated into something you could play with many others all at once feels
      right&#133;</b> </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">We are currently working on a
      separate product that addresses these excellent points. However, we cannot comment on it
      further at this time out of courtesy to our publisher (man am I evil or what? :).</font></small></p>

    First is on Characters and balance.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">1- which one is better at PURE
      melee: rogues or rangers?( not counting on the ranger`s spells, just melee) </font></small></p>
      <p><strong><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The ranger is a hybrid
      character, the rogue is pure melee. You guess. </font></small></strong></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">: 2- will i have a bad time
      trying to buy things even after a raised my reputation killing evil monsters as a rogue? </font></small></p>
      <p><strong><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Depends on how much you
      kill and where. </font></small></strong></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">: 3- Why rogues dont get the KICK
      skill??? Rangers get. </font></small></p>
      <p><strong><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The same reason (insert
      class here) doesn't get (insert skill here). Balance. </font></small></strong></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">: 4- i heard that the rangers
      spells( and the other Hybrids) were changer due to their weakness at the level they are
      taken. Is that tryue? if yes, in what way did they change the spells? </font></small></p>
      <p><strong><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Spells will be viable at
      the level they are given. </font></small></strong></p>

    <p><small>What to do after level 50?</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">while from all the info EQ looks
      like a great game I'm concerned about leveling out at 50. I mean why continue to play if
      after your 50th level you have no where to go? </font></small></p>
      <p><strong><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">This is a misconception.
      There are plenty of places to go after reaching level 50. </font></small></strong></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">: This is something to look into,
      I'm sure there are dedicated players who will reach 50 within 6 months then what happens
      to the community? </font></small></p>
      <p><strong><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Yes, and there will be
      dedicated players who don't reach level 50 for a year, and most will never reach it. The
      structure of the game makes sure there are fun things to do after reaching level 50. </font></small></strong></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">: what about the players who want
      to be nothing but a wizard or a bard? after level 50 it's time to go to another game
      because after all it's kinda pointless to go on w/no advancement. </font></small></p>
      <p><strong><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Well, if you ONLY want to
      be a wizard, and your wizard is level 50, and the ONLY reason you are playing is to
      advance, and you don't care about adventuring after you reach level 50 even though you
      still haven't seen the whole world, then yes, it is probably time to go elsewhere. But
      again, there is plenty of things to do after you reach level 50. You just do them without
      becoming more powerful.</font></small></strong></p>

      the legions of Dungeons and Dragons diehards who made that cerebral table game a cult

      undertaking that delivers on nearly every front. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">It was a hit before it ever got
      to store shelves, selling fast in pre-orders over the Internet as word of mouth spread.
      Even those who've never played Dungeons and Dragons are getting hooked. It's a slam dunk
      for anybody with a taste for the kind of fantasy, myth and legend popularized in &quot;The
      Hobbit&quot; and &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">&quot;Baldur's Gate&quot;
      (Interplay, five CD-ROMs for Windows, $49.95) faithfully follows the complex rules set
      down a decade ago in the second edition of Advanced Dungeons and Dragons, a hugely popular
      role-playing game that uses special dice, along with pen-and-paper, to compute conflict
      outcomes and keep individual statistics. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Taking the game successfully into
      cyberspace - something tried before with mediocre results - required a monumental two-year
      effort to build its vast, detailed graphic landscapes, extensive variety of inhabitants,
      animals and monsters, as well as the astounding artificial intelligence system that
      governs play. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">There's no human Dungeon Master
      anymore to make often arbitrary judgment calls, which is a good thing, since you can't get
      on the bad side of the impartial artificial intelligence in &quot;Baldur's Gate.&quot; </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The end result is a lush world of
      ancient good and evil, where hand-to-hand combat and spell-casting are as common as
      hunger, thirst and tired feet, where friend and foe can be hard to tell apart. </font></small></p>

      into a complex story of intrigue seemingly destined to bring all-out war in the land known
      as the Sword Coast, where the largest city is Baldur's Gate, named for the great explorer
      Baldurian, whose disappearance is one of many mysteries ripe for investigation. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Choosing to take the form of one
      of the several races living together in the mythic realm, players can be human, elf,
      dwarf, gnome or a mixed breed half-elf or halfling. Callings include warrior, priest,
      sneak thief and sorcerer. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Traveling between towns is
      complicated by an array of mythical monsters including ogres, tree sprites and nymphs,
      giant spiders, ghouls, gibberlings, hobgoblins, skeleton swordsmen and the pesky Xvart
      (evil creatures the size of a Smurf), along with more recognizable wild critters like
      wolves, bears and ferocious dogs of war. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Safety is far from assured in a
      town because there are assassins, thieves and spies roaming among relatively benign
      citizens who may have valuable information to share or needed commodities for sale.
      Players must gain knowledge, learn magic, build strong reputations and recruit allies to
      form groups of up to six members, which increase the odds for survival in the fiercely
      hostile environment. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Weapons come from a medieval
      arsenal, ranging from spiked clubs, swords, daggers and battle axes to slings, bows and
      war hammers. There are also magic rings and amulets, along with potions and enchanted
      weapons that deal out greatly magnified damage. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The graphics, viewed from an
      overhead perspective, are stunning, especially on high-end computers with topflight video
      cards. Characters are sometimes a bit small to be fully appreciated, but the
      bird's-eye-view, which allows players to see a wide area, makes that minor fault a
      necessary evil. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The game's artificial
      intelligence is a wonder, building player profiles based on gained experience as the quest
      proceeds, among many other things. So many variables enter the equations that even the
      brainiest players will be forever challenged. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The multiplayer option in
      &quot;Baldur's Gate&quot; will be disappointing to some because the group leader remains
      the only player who can make many decisions, with other five players taking the parts of
      group members controlled by the computer in single-player mode. The supporting players can
      do certain things on their own in battle, but most other moves require approval from the
      group leader. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">A true online version, with
      dozens of players involved all having individual autonomy and full decision powers, isn't
      available yet, but is something developers say they are looking into. It would be tough to
      come up with, considering the server logistics of handling dozens of players at once and
      the immense number of calculations and tabulations that would require, but it's a nice
      dream. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">&quot;Baldur's Gate&quot; is a
      rarity in computer games, a harmonious blend of strategy and adventure with plenty of
      hack-and-slash, enough variety to please almost any taste.</font></small></p>

    <small>Now here's a game that isn't getting much hype lately. Actually not getting much
    hype at all. <a href="http://www.next-generation.com/jsmid/index.html">NGO</a> has slipped
    up<font color="#FFFFFF"><strong> a little progress report</strong></font> on it and to say
    they are going to dish out a review soon.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p></i><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">&quot;Silver's official
      release date is set as March 19th for English, French, German, Italian, Spanish and Dutch
      versions,&quot; informed the title's Lead Programmer, Bobby Earl, &quot;with Brazilian,
      Portuguese, Polish, Japanese and a localised US version to follow. Our master date for the
      English is currently February 9th, in order for all subsequent territories to be tested by
      March 19th.&quot; </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Silver has already been compared
      to the Final Fantasy series by many industry insiders, having seen the game's development
      progress, and Infogrames certainly has high hopes for the title. When quizzed on the
      game's status in the hours leading up to its completion, Earl replied: &quot;The game is
      looking fantastic, but I would say that wouldn't I? We've had some really good coverage in
      the magazines, as you've probably seen, and there's a hell of a lot more to come leading
      up to release.&quot; </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Look out for a world exclusive

      rules have changed, communication is now set in stone and idea's that you have asked for
      are now in the game. Everything ranging from Player killing, to experience from spells to
      quests are now answered in the FAQ. We also updated the monster lists revealing more of
      the models you can expect to see in the Unknown. We have also fixed more of the flash
      site, ranging from easier access to links, repairing the html pages connected to the site.

    <small>Glen got around to doing his<font color="#FFFFFF"><strong> weekly update on the
    progress</strong></font> of Wheel of Time. Here's the bit to get you pumped up.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="2" color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Mark just returned from his
      epic trip (insert groan here) to Raleigh.&nbsp; According to his report, it was time very
      well spent.&nbsp; He went undercover with Tim, Steve, Cliff, Myscha, et al. to covertly
      merge all of our recent changes into the new engine build and do a few other super-secret
      things (including see Prince of Egypt with Mark R. and wife).&nbsp;&nbsp; Just for those
      interested, he also got a chance to take a close view at the current state of Unreal
      Tournament and, naturally, it rocks.&nbsp; The merges went very smoothly, and we're very
      anxious to move on up to 221, but likely nothing that risky will happen for alpha, and
      that's what we're all focused on right now.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Speaking of which, the entire
      team is working hard to make alpha happen.&nbsp; We just played a huge multi-player arena
      match tonight to gauge performance and, while we had to share the game with a bunch of
      bugs, it was a lot of fun.&nbsp; It definitely demonstrated that we've got our work cut
      out for us, but we also enjoyed it immensely.&nbsp; One step closer.&nbsp; Now, we have to
      look at all of the logs and figure out what happened and why.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The level designers continue to
      polish and add content to the existing maps.&nbsp;&nbsp; We're very close to the point
      where you can walk from the beginning of the game to the end; there are lots of red marks
      on my white board today (indicating completed tasks for each of the levels), but there are
      still a few more to go.&nbsp; The lds are really producing some wonderful maps which will
      only get better with each iteration.&nbsp; Some maps that I anticipated would be
      relatively small (the Ways, Saving the White Tower) turned out to be monstrous--in a good
      way.&nbsp; There's a lot more content there than I had been planning on, and it's
      wonderful.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Robert is here this week again
      to work on decorations and artifact effects, but he didn't show up alone.&nbsp; Robert is
      traditionally an off-site artist who works remotely from our home office in Boston. (you
      have to have been following some of the bizarre news reports about the acquisition to get
      that joke).&nbsp; He's made the trek here with his wife and newborn son to check out the
      area for suitable living quarters.&nbsp; If he finds some, there's a good chance that
      Robert (and the Robertettes) will join us permanently in the immediate area, which would
      be great.&nbsp; I'd been hoping for something like this for some time.&nbsp; His
      interaction with the rest of the team, especially as it concerns the special effects, is
      invaluable.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">While Paul, Julie, and Marc
      continue to produce the wonderful Aes Sedai textures that have made them famous, Joel has
      been focusing on new skins--including a fairly disturbing projectile for Legion. &nbsp;
      Have you ever seen a soul vomited up?&nbsp; I'd be surprised.&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, Joel
      has--and now he's shown the rest of us.&nbsp; Take my word for it: it's not pretty.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Ryan, Mike, Jess, and Aaron
      continue to focus on their areas of responsibility and we're seeing both leaps and bounds
      in AI performance and artifact effects, as well as huge strides towards network
      replication stability.&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, there's lots of work to do, but now we're seeing
      some real progress based on all of the architecture laid down a while ago.&nbsp; It's been
      Ryan's dream to design an elegant and flexible AI system that Legend would build on from
      product to product.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's becoming clear that this approach was correct; the
      initial design is now really paying off.&nbsp; Each day, we see that much more behavior
      than before.&nbsp; Soon, we'll have to tone our creatures down so they don't kill us too
      easily.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">It's a very stressful time
      right now.&nbsp; We're watching the game come together before our eyes.&nbsp; While
      there's a ton of stuff there, putting the machine together is also revealing how many
      holes there are, or which pieces aren't working correctly.&nbsp;&nbsp; At this stage,
      there's almost as much ahead making it all work as there was creating it all in the first
      place.&nbsp; But this team is focused and excited.&nbsp; As always, I'm very proud to be
      working with all of them, from the people who started on day one with the prototype shots
      to the people who only showed up at the party recently.&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone who works
      here is very talented and dedicated, and the game shows it.</font></p>

    <blockquote>
      <i><p></i><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Seriously graphically
      innovative games like Xenogears, the FF series, Metal Gear Solid, Dungeon Keeper, etc. I
      hope a good deal of the game comes off with a console RPG environment feel, and not just
      trying to make things realistic as possible. My theory has always been that realism is not
      the best goal to aim for yet, with every item that looks spot-on realistic, something else
      has to me made that much more cooler to not look out of place. I don't think technology is
      quite there yet to make things look like life, I'd much rather take a cool style and run
      with it in another direction. Games like Grim Fandango are a testament to how great things
      can look when you hit the ground running away from reality. The Q2 engine is surprisingly
      flexible for this kind of environmental stuff when you start getting creative with it and
      breaking more than a few traditions. </font></small></p>
