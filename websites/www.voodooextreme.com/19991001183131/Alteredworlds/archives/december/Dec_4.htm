      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">LAS VEGAS, NV, December 4, 1998 -
      From the far reaches of Gladstone to the streets of New York City, Westwood Studios today
      announced that the first public showing of the highly anticipated role playing game (RPG)
      Lands of Lore III, will take place on Tuesday, December 8 at 7:30 PM at Manhattan's
      Neutral Ground gaming club. The event is free and open to the public. Neutral Ground is

      rich heritage of the epic role playing game series with a new adventure, new characters,
      and the immersive gameplay that fans have come to expect from Westwood Studios. Lore III
      features classic RPG elements like professions, guild quests, skills, familiars and an
      expansive spell system. However, the game is more accessible than ever thanks to a
      streamlined, easy-to-use interface, detailed auto-mapping, and a self-annotating journal
      that is virtually a manual that builds itself as you play. The epic story leads you
      through huge six words, each one with its own challenges and surprises. Lands of Lore 3
      will be released early next year. </font></small></p>

      the evening a wide assortment of games -- card games, role playing games, chess, board
      games, as well as darts, pinball, and video games. Every day Neutral Ground features an
      intensive daily schedule of events that include several type of RPG tournaments for a
      variety of great prizes. There are also sign ups for leagues, classes, RPG campaigns,

    <small>Yup, the Everquest joy just keeps on coming in. All I see are incredibly positive

      previously released, though it bears most similarity to Meridian 59 and to Ultima Online
      and will always be compared to their ilk. In real world terms this game is the gamers
      version of crack. You cannot pry yourself from the keyboard until you are up way past your

    Demo Review</strong></font></a> <a href="mailto:sacrates@voodooextreme.com"><small>-
    Sacrates</small></a><br>
    <small>Welcome to the brave new world of FPS gaming. Half life and Thief have come along
    and nearly redefined the experience in two fell swoops. Thief is extremely interesting in
    that it is a combination of various genre's including RPG. <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>And
    we all know Half life kicks everything elses collective asses</strong></font>. With that
    said 3DGN have kicked up a<a href="http://www.3dgaming.net/demos/shooters/thief/"> review
    of the Demo</a> for all to see until we start seeing full version reviews. </small></p>
    <font color="#ffffff" face="Arial" size="2"><blockquote>
      <p></font><font size="2" color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The atmosphere, in
      accordance with Gameplay, is nothing short of superb. When starting off, you can hear the
      drunken guard moaning and speaking jibberish while the other guard trades pleasantries
      with you - they won't attack unless you un-sheath your sword or arm an arrow. Once you get
      into the compound you can overhear guards talking, one explaining the whole concept of
      guarding the compound to the other. You can also here them call for backup if they hear
      you in a dark corner, or yell &quot;Ahh! They got him!&quot; if they spot a fallen
      comrade. <br>
      <br>
      Overall, I would say Thief is an above average game. If the demo is any indication (damn I
      say that a lot) then you can expect that I'd be first in line to pick up my copy -
      regardless that if I wait a few days I could probably get it through my editor for review.
      While the game may have a few flaws such as long load times or somewhat choppy graphics,
      they don't seriously hinder the gameplay in any way. I said it once and I'll say it again,
      I have seen the future of First-Person Shooter games in Thief: The Dark Project.</font></p>

      can pause, and declare the parties intentions. Fighters advance, archers target, cleric
      get ready to heal, mage is prepping, and the thief is in the shadows ready to put a big
      hurt on some one. The NPCs both in your party and abroad have entertaining and clever
      dialogs to which you are given different choices as to how you will respond; some are very
      funny. The story line is well written and the bad guys are very bad indeed (The kind you
      love to make pay). I have encountered many surprising and exciting sub-quests on my
      travails as well. Its a great game that sucks you and your play time in like a vampire

      &quot;Origin is committed to making sure Ultima: Ascension meets the highest standard of
      excellence. An experienced group of Origin testers is checking every aspect of the game to
      make sure that the game meets the quality and playability standards that our customers
      expect. &quot;</font></small></p>

      Microsoft, 3Dfx, Intel, etc. been so far with providing development support and equipment?
      Foresee any problems with Microsoft? </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">[Albert] Most of the development
      support we've needed has come from Epic, and more specifically, Tim Sweeney, who has been
      very helpful in answering our Unreal questions. There's an Unreal Programming mailing list
      which all the licensees subscribe to that is also a good source of information. Because
      we're using Unreal, we haven't had to concern ourselves (yet) with hardware compatibility.
      If a piece of hardware works with Unreal, it'll work with our game. If it doesn't, we've
      done something horribly wrong on our end. :) </font></small></p>
