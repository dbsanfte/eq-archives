    </strong></font><font color="#FFFFFF">PC Gamer UK recently did an interview with John
    Carmack of ID. Why would I post this on an RPG related site you may wonder? Well because
    everything this man says or does will affect the 3D community down the road and will
    inevitably affect our RPG's etc! Not to mention I love listening to him talk! I ripped
    this off VE:</font><em><p><font color="#008080">Say, if you toss a grenade under a desk,
    you'd like to see it modelled so it shoots out from underneath and billows into a big
    cloud. That´s the type of thing you could do with an expanding particle model&quot; <br>
    &quot;The level designers, right now, build with blocks and assign textures to the blocks.
    In the future they'll be able to to bend the blocks to fit curves to them, and assign
    fractal noise to theam and surfaces as both displacement maps and texture modifiers.&quot;
    &quot;However, the most obvious immediate benefit of next-generation engine is going to be
    scalable detail: to be able to have an outdoor area and do it well, be able to look down a
    canyon, or see a building in the distance and walk all the way up to it&quot;</font></em></p>
