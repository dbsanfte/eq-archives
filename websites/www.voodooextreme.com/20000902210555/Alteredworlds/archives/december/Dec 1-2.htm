    <small>Greg Peterson can't hold himself back from posting all these good comments on the
    recent Baldur's Gate beta test they had in CA. Here are<font color="#FFFFFF"><strong> a
    few more tasty morsels</strong></font> for you to read up on.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p></i><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">I have only heard back
      from two other beta-testers... I am going to resend my note this week and hope to get a
      better response rate. Here are two more comments... </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">#1 Just a few words on the game.
      I thought the game was well developed and the bugs, not too bad. I&#146;m only on chapter
      2 right now cause I was gone for the holidays. I have sent 2 pages of bugs and suggestions
      already. If you would like to have a copy of those pages let me know. Also I think the
      game is very fun. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">#2 Well, I must say I was
      expecting a lot, with all the hype, and the Interplay and the BioWare team really
      impressed me beyond my expectations. Believe me, this isn't vaporware (I don't think
      vaporware takes up 2.5GB of my HD). The interface is very user-friendly (we didn't receive
      any sort of guide or overview manual so all of us had to figure everything out ourselves,
      and trust me, it wasn't difficult at all). I love how the full information on spells and
      items is just a right-click over the icon, which also includes a history of the item, if
      it has one (usually most of the magical weapons and armor do). The NPCs are well-written
      and I was surprised that the characters squabbled or complimented each other the way they
      did, which sometimes lead them to attacking or thanking each other. The artwork, and not
      just the background art, is wonderfully done. As for bugs, not many. Most of my bug
      reports have been for mispelling that I caught and sometimes tweaky grammar, very few game
      ruining and pretty much only one crashed the game on me (and it happens rarely). I think I
      enjoy single-player much more then I do multiplayer... I find multiplayer a tad slow for
      my liking. I thought that since AD&amp;D is pretty much turn-based and BG is real-time,
      that the whole game would be really strange to play, but I found that it was quite well
      done. Haven't been getting much sleep at all lately, which stinks since I work early in
      the morning at my other job. And yes, I have to agree with what one of the other testers
      have already stated, it was great to hear that you wanted our suggestions too, even though
      we pretty much aren't involved in the project at all. It just shows that you guys care and
      want to release a quality product with BG. It's an honest pleasure to &quot;be a part of
      the team&quot;, even if it's just for a little while, to do what we can to help make BG
      great. Many thank yous for the opportunity and kudos go to everyone involved with the
      project. </font></small></p>

    WEWP has posted a <a href="http://www.wewp.com/Previews/Show.asp?NID=85">Preview of Drakan</a>
    to do just that. Here's a blatant cut and paste from those bad boys over at Drakan
    Chronicles.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <font face="Arial" size="2"><p></font><font color="#8080C0" size="2" face="Bookman Old Style">OK. Now you must be wondering if I have gone off the deep end,
      since this article was supposed to be about a game called Drakan, made by a totally
      different company with no ties to Eidos. Well, let me assure you that this IS indeed still
      an article about Drakan, and Drakan has a lot to do with Tomb Raider (at least from my
      point of view). In fact, if I can convince you to see exactly just how bad the Tomb Raider
      games are, the lead (Rynn) in Drakan could possibly replace Lara Croft as the poster chick
      of lonely adolescent male gamers all over the world. Rynn has all the requisite moves and
      toys that would categorize her as a possible Lara-Killer. She has back-flips, cartwheels,
      rolls, a 50 weapon arsenal, and a huge dragon as her buddy.</font></p>

    newsbrief</strong></font></a><a href="mailto:sacrates@voodooextreme.com"><small> -
    Sacrates</small></a><br>
    <small>It's always happy time in Sacrates land when more ME goodness comes along. There is
    a lot of controversy right now over the permanent death system in ME. Personally<font color="#FFFFFF"><strong> I think it's the shit</strong></font>, but many others don't.
    Here is a post on killing other players under this situation.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Allow me to clarify the exact
      circumstances of when you can kill anoher player:</font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">1) If a player is a murderer you
      can attack and kill them without ramifications. This is, of course, assuming that you are
      in a geographic area where the player is branded a killer.</font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">2) If a player attacks you, you
      can kill them in self defense without ramifications whether they are a murderer or not. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">3) You can only take the life of
      an unconscious body that is not guarded. I should have made this more clear before. Our
      combat system will allow you to guard both conscious and unconscious people. If someone is
      guarding an unconscious person then there is a pretty good chance that you can not kill
      that person. By pretty good, I mean that it is still possible. You can only guard against
      so many players, making it quite possible to be overrun by superior numbers. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Now, I'm very much aware of the
      pack mentality of PKers. A well run pack of PKers may well be able to kill some players
      before being dealt with. I'm counting on this to be a pretty rare event. With the time
      that has to be invested in your character before you can even partake in murder combined
      with the potentially dire consequences for such actions I'm confident that most KewlD00ds
      will find the enjoyment lost. They key to this system working is making the benefits of
      player-killing miniscule in comparison to playing the game as it's meant. Our current
      approach handles that goal.</font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>Here's another interesting post on why they opted to go with the Isometric view
    rather than the 1st person.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The reason we chose to develop
      the engine to disallow a free floating camera is a matter of performance. Simply put, we
      can take lots of shortcuts in our engine if we avoid the evils of a free floating camera.
      These shortcuts allow us to have much higher polygon counts than our competitors. Higher
      polygon counts mean more realistic looking artwork. Not only that, but since our world is
      partitioned into to large regions it would be quite bizarre in a Tomb Raider like view
      when you came across the region boundaries. Speed is of the essence. We need to have large
      amounts of trees actually crowding the screen in many places. Do do that we need to take
      lots of shortcuts. ;)</font></small></p>

    <blockquote>
      <strong><p><font color="#8080C0" size="2" face="Bookman Old Style">6. Rumour has it that
      the attention to detail present in Deus Ex is taken to new extremes, with the Hong Kong
      levels proudly touting rats and litter, all enhancing the 'atmosphere', to what extent
      will such perfectionism affect the player, and what other delightful little touches will
      be present?</font></strong></p>
      <p><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"><font size="2">Once again, the idea is
      to immerse the player into as real an environment as possible so that things they would
      expect to happen in the real world, will happen here. If you throw a chair through a
      window in our game it will probably break the glass and if it falls to the street below,
      the chair might break and maybe it won't (Better chance of breaking the higher up you
      are). If you shoot into a crowd, the people will scatter and run, just like they would in
      the real world. There are many more examples, but that is enough for now.</font> </font></p>

    second coming and the games looks dialed... The guys over at <a href="http://216.15.145.96">Riva 3D</a> have thrown up an interview with Bob Stevenson of
    Planet Moon Studios, the guys behind the new 3D 1st person/RTS game Giants. Check the
    interview (and some very cool screenshots) out <a href="http://216.15.145.96/bobs.html">here</a>.</small></p>

    <small>There's two new Ultima:Ascension shots up over on <a href="#NPC Screenshots">Sith
    Dragon's U:A page</a>. They are from the new issue of Computer Gaming World and kinda
    scanned like <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>peering through 6 feet of fog</strong></font>,
    but hey, if you dig on U:A check em out.</small></p>

    <small>Looks like everyone <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>updated at midnight last night</strong></font>...Glen
    popped up his weekly Wheel Of Time <a href="http://www.wheeloftime.com/">update</a> late
    yesterday. The usual make me drool tidbits on how the game is progressing.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">With the Thanksgiving weekend,
      and the recent release of both Half Life and Zelda (and, of course, the <a href="http://www.perceptum.com/" target="_top">Varghina Incident demo</a>), it's amazing
      that <em>anything</em> happened here last week, especially since my last update got
      written on a Tuesday.&nbsp; However, the team sees the deadlines looming, so there's no
      rest for the weary.&nbsp; Despite the distractions, we've made some real progress.</font></small></p>

    <small>Oops...missed this one yesterday :). Feargus was on the official Fallout2 site
    again, trying to put our fears of <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>another patch of death</strong></font>
    to rest. </small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"><small>Well I hope everyone had a great
      Thanksgiving - a bunch of us actually took a whole day off. I haven't whined in an update
      for a while, so I need to give Desslock something to edit out. :) </p>
      <p>Anyway we continue to fix things for the patch like disappearing Power Armor that is
      being worn by Party Members when they go up levels, and what seems to be the last problems
      with the Car that shows up on the Raiders Map. There are other things that I have gotten
      from people that we are fixing as well. </p>
      <p>Our QA department continues to test the game, and we are fixing things as they find
      them. They are all a little gun shy right now about missing things, so they are being very
      very careful. </p>
      <p>We should have the Final Patch through QA sometime between 12/4 and 12/11. That final
      date is in case something horrible happens, but at this point I don't think it will have
      to get that long. We are still working on the utility to bring your character over from a
      Save Game. That will be ready the same time as the Final Patch. </p>
      <p>I have gotten a lot of E-mail from people worried that Fallout 3 will be a First Person
      Shooter (FPS) because of the statement that it is going to use a 3D engine. So everyone
      knows, it will not be a FPS, but it is possible that it will use a 3D engine - think Myth.
      Having said that, Fallout 3 has not been launched as an official project yet - we are just
      throwing ideas around. </p>
      <p>Finally, thanks for all the E-mail form people and for the guys up on ICQ on Saturday
      that helped with a few bugs. </p>

            Oh yes. Since there is nothing else at the moment that can even scratch the surface of
            this brilliance i'm gonna keep this up. This game gets me more excited than seeing naked

            <small><small>We all game for that one experience that totally Immerses us into it's story

            movie. I still know quite a few people who haven't gotten this Gem yet and it's a shame.
