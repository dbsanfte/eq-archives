    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">I'm not sure everyone is
      understanding the issue of cusomization in EQ. So let me clarify: </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">EverQuest has 12 races X 2 sexes
      X between 4 &amp; 8 texture sets X virtually unlimited tinting of serveral of the texture
      sets. And on top of that approximately 8 faces per race/sex. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">And on top of that, the
      characters are divided up such that you could have a crimson breastplate, leather boots, a
      chainmail coif, etc. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">From this perspective, the
      characters are very customizable. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">But here's a key difference that
      some players are perhaps not seeing in that just about everyone is a newbie: it's what you
      wear that makes you look different. If you want a crimson breastplate, you're going to
      have to buy one or quest for one. You don't just arbitrarily set yourself to any color.
      This way you can have real pride when you appear different, and when a higher level player
      strolls through the streets of Qeynos, people KNOW he's formidible. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">An example would be when I visit
      Norrath as Aradune -- I'm garbed like a high level warrior (actually, paladin, even though
      I'm a ranger :). I have emerald plate on and am wielding a fiery avenger 2 handed sword. I
      definitely stand out, and people constantly ask me 'where did you get that armor?' To
      which I typically respond that armor such as I wear is found in the depths of dungeons. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Now if I could just head down to
      the tailor at level 3 and buy some plate and color it green... well, that really cheapens
      the RP experience from our perspective. Perhaps some of you will disagree, but this was a
      design decision we made for EverQuest long ago (you'll see similar examples from me in
      chat logs and interviews probably dating over a year ago). </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Now I will say that not every
      item changes appearance, and that we are limited to some degree in terms of how many
      textures will fit in the texture memory of widespread 3D cards. But still, when you do the
      math and calculate the combinations, it's pretty unprecedented.</font></small></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">If you're like me, the EQ /loc
      numbers are a little confusing. X,Y,Z is easy to figure, but what about heading and how
      does that all relate to sense heading skill? Well, I sat down last night (playing a troll
      no less) and decided to figure it out. Here's what I found out. The EQ coordinate system
      uses a standard X,Y,Z axis. If you've ever plotted anything on a graph you know how that
      works. The problem is, EQ doesn't use a standard 0-360 degree heading. For some reason
      they use a 0-512 degree heading (maybe that's just a different system, I don't know).
      Having 512 degrees means that the standard degrees translate like this. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">0 and 360 = 0 and 512 (they're
      the same point)<br>
      90 = 128<br>
      180 = 256<br>
      270 = 384<br>
      </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">To further complicate things, as
      you look at this graph system plotted, the direction North is not &quot;up&quot;, at 128
      degrees. Nope, North is &quot;right&quot; at 0/512 degrees. Here's a list of the 8 main
      directions, their corresponding heading, and what moving in that direction will do to your
      X and Y /loc numbers.(keep in mind since you can't get exactly on a certain heading there
      will be minor variation. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">North = 0/512 degrees heading,
      increase X axis/no change in Y axis.<br>
      Northwest = 64 degrees, increase both X and Y axes.<br>
      West = 128 degrees, increase y axis/ no change in X axis.<br>
      Southwest = 192 degrees heading, decrease X/increase Y.<br>
      South = 256 degrees heading, decrease X/no change in Y.<br>
      Southeast = 320 degrees heading, decrease both X and Y axes.<br>
      East = 384 degrees heading, decrease Y/ no change in X.<br>
      Northeast = 448 degrees heading, increase X/ decrease Y.</font></small></p>

      is best described as Baldur's Gate meets Half-Life. Using next-generation technology
      coupled with one of the most original and detailed story lines, I wondered how the game
      would handle combat. &quot;We plan on doing it all in real time, inside the game engine.
      It should be seamless with the rest of gameplay. Character positioning, choosing correct
      actions, and getting terrain advantages will all contribute to success in combat,&quot;

    <small>Stephen Nichols hit the boards to give out a description of how closely they were
    going to stay to the original Middle Earth writings.<font color="#FFFFFF"><strong> Here's
    the biscuit.</strong></font></small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">There has been quite
      a bit of excitement on the board lately regarding whether or not our interpretation of
      Middle-earth for massively multi-player use is correct or not. Most of this conflict
      revolves around the inclusion of a global chat system within the game. I've stated my
      reasoning for the inclusion of such a system in the game and have no intention of
      wavering. I truly believe that global chat serves a very useful purpose in ANY massively
      multi-player game and should not be excluded. While I agree with you on many of the issues
      at hand (i.e. global chat, map scale, animal breeding, etc.) I must make what I consider
      to be the right decisions (given our development schedule) for the viability of this game.
      I fully agree with and appreciate the fact that a global chat system may have a negative
      impact on some players, but that does not negate the usefulness of it for many. Yes, it
      can give the players who use it an unfair advantage over those who don't. There is very
      little that can be done to eliminate the use of external chat programs and what CAN be
      done is easily (and undetectibly) reversed by an intelligent hacker. I think on the point
      of global chat we will have to agree to disagree. While there have been very few vocal
      supporters for global chat on this board, that does not mean that they don't exist. As it
      sits right now Middle-earth is barely known by the hard-core gamers let alone the casual
      market. Most input that we get off of the board is generally from hard-core RPG players
      with lots of Tolkien knowledge... that's great, but it's not representative of the overall
      gaming population. The Lord of the Rings sold millions upon millions of copies. Do you
      really think that each and every one of those readers is a hard-core role-player with a
      huge reperitore of Tolkien knowledge? No, I think not. If they were, then there would be
      no argument as to what features are included in the game. Now, our overall goal is to make
      a great game based on the world of Middle-earth. That means that our locations, races, RPG
      system, magic system and stories are based wholly on the writing of Tolkien. We are very
      much aware and sensitive to the need of keeping the game as close to the writings as
      possible. There are, however, times where this close relationship is weakened to
      accomodate ease of use features. Global chat is one such example. My job is to make sure
      that this game is as close to the works as possible so long as that closeness does not
      make the game unfun. Sometimes these goals conflict and in those times I have to use my
      best judgement in selecting what makes the cut. There are simply not enough hours in the
      day for me to debate every issue on this board. To me, this board is a helpful resource
      that gives me valuable insight into the minds of our hard-core players. My occasional
      responses are due to time limitations, not desire for debate. Ultimately, it seems to me
      that some of you believe that if I disagree with you then the game is worthless to you. To
      that I have no rebuttal except that there are a great many games of this kind in the works
      and you are sure to find something that strikes your fancy. I don't say that in an
      arrogant tone, but in a realistic one. I can not please everyone... I won't even try. I
      will, however, make a great game that will give lots of people enjoyment... both hard-core
      Tolkien fans and casual fans alike. After all that's what's important; making a fun game
      that will entertain loads of people (hard-core Tolkien fans and casual players alike).</font></small></p>

    <small>Those wacky news Pimps over at AGN poked up <a
    href="http://www.agn3d.com/softwaresection/default.cfm?revid=62">1999's most anticipated
    3D games</a>. Of course the top 2 spots were taken by two psuedo RPG games. System Shock 2
    and Diablo 2. One thing I am disappointed by though, where is Everquest? I can't actually
    forgive them for slapping up Daikatana over EQ. <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Hell while
    they're at it where is Barbie's Dream Date?</strong></font> I love Jeremy and the guys
    over there (Not that way damnit) but to actually place an unproven Ion Storm game against
    an already proven EQ is like tying a rock to my jewels and tossing it out the window.
    Otherwise i'd say the rest of the Preview isn't bad.</small></p>

    <small>Here's a little juiciness that all you phase 4 testers should have recieved in the
    mail last night.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Dear EverQuest Phase 4 Testers, </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">We wanted to give you an update
      as to what's going on with the P4 Test: </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">1) First and foremost, we had a
      problem with our registration server - THIS IS NOW FIXED. If you haven't been able to
      register yet, please try again now. We've attached your account key to the bottom of this
      email in case you lost it, or for some reason you didn't get your original. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">2) Chat Server problems - We've
      gotten rid of all the big problems we had early on with the chat server. We're sorry about
      this happening, but we needed the load to find out some of these problems. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">3) No CD's? - We're just in the
      process of sending out another 100 or so CD's. Out of almost 25k Phase 4 testers, less
      than 300 people didn't get their CD's. Most of these people are in Canada, although there
      are some elsewhere. We believe those people will eventually get their CD's, but we wanted
      to make sure that everyone get's their CD's. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">4) Server Stability - We had a
      couple of big problems, but as of now the servers have really stabalized. Over the weekend
      they were crashing quite a bit due to one particular bug. That's been fixed, so life
      should be good again!! </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">5) Lockups at the Character
      Select Screen - We think we've fixed this problem, and the fix should be up on the Test
      Server later this evening. Please give it a try up there by running TestEverQuest.exe. If
      that works we will publish to all the servers shortly thereafter. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">6) Getting kicked back to chat
      when logging in - We believe this problem has been fixed in the version that is up right
      now. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">7) Random lockups after playing
      for a short period of time - We think this is sound related, and are still tracking this
      down. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">8) Banshee Drivers - The version
      of Glide 3.x that is up on the 3dfx website for the Banshee has some MAJOR problems. 3dfx
      has been working with us directly on this, and has solved the problem. They have given us
      a special &quot;EverQuest Banshee Driver&quot; that is really a test version of some
      drivers that will be released publicly very shortly. They were kind enough to provide us
      with those drivers. You can ONLY get these drivers at www.everquest.com under the Phase 4
      video card faq section. These drivers should be posted either tonight, or tomorrow. This
      should allow Banshee users to play under Glide. If you DON'T get these drivers, and still
      use the old ones, it is likely that you will simply lock up. So PLEASE download them once
      they are available. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Very shortly we will be putting
      the music back into the game. We've been doing a lot of work with the various sound card
      companies to try and make sure everything is solid before releasing that code to you
      folks. It should be up on the test server in the next day or so. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">In addition to all of the above
      items, the Dev Team is hard at work on all of the in-game bugs. We had to concentrate on
      the main problems with getting into the game first, and getting the game back to a stable
      code-base. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">We appreciate your patience with
      us on these issues, as we have been under a tremendous amount of pressure to make these
      changes as fast as we can, while still testing things out before we just put up a patch. </font></small></p>

    time featuring the home of those cuddly and lovable Barbarians. If there is one thing EQ
    is missing it's blood or visible damage. I think the true fantasy scene is a Barbarian
    coming back from a day of raping and pillaging with blood smeared over their beaten
    bodies. Sometimes in EQ when they come back from such an excursion they look like they
    just <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>got out of a bath with a few big breasted Nymphs</strong></font>
    who slapped some paint (Colored vasoline) on their bodies.&nbsp; Damn, i'm gonna have to

    href="mailto:sacrates@voodooextreme.com"><small>- Sacrates</small></a><br>
    <small><font color="#8080FF">Warning: Sacrates spew ahead!</font> Here it is the true
    philosophy why Everquest is such a good game.<font color="#FFFFFF"><strong> It ultimately
    forces players to be social.</strong></font> People love to say they hate to be forced
    into doing something but in this case it works out so well. For as long as I have been
    playing I have seen this in EQ. Kids that act like jerks become known as kill stealers or
    just spammers then nobody will team with them and they don't level up anymore because in
    higher levels it's suicide to solo or just takes much longer to level up. I mean yes, EQ
    makes UO look shamefull in every way other than this, but this one reason is why EQ is
    such a good game in the long run. (Oh and let's not forget those skimpy little outfits the
    girls wear too!) Here's Dave Rickey on the situation.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">About 10th level or so, you learn
      that you *must* get along with the people around you, and that Norrath is a big world but
      a very small town. People who do antisocial things have a harder time finding groups and
      getting help when they need it. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">I've seen this in action several
      times, Phase 4 may not last long enough for it to have full effect. Remember who the jerks
      are, tell others about them, and trust to Karma. Eventually they start new characters and
      either you leave them way behind, or they start to behave.</font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>He just described it perfectly. I have already seen this in action in Phase 4
    too. So all you anti social nutcases out there who just started Phase 4 better read up.
    Otherwise times will be tough on you. That is what this type of game is all about anyway,
    playing with others. (not that way damnit) If you don't want to get along with all the
    other Reindeer then Play Quake or a single player game or UO for that matter. Sorry for
    the speech but this is the one thing about EQ I enjoy so much and why I like Massive
    Multiplayer games more than the Single player experience. </small></p>

    <blockquote>

      great news!!! </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">We have worked out a deal with
      3dfx. They are have given us some special EverQuest Drivers for the Banshee. We are
      testing them now and will have them up on our site on Monday. They WON'T be up on the 3dfx
      site, as they aren't going to be offically supported by 3dfx. They do fix the Glide 3.X
      problems that were present in the previous driver. In addition, please note that currently
      you won't see a Glide option with the Banshee - just the Primary Display Driver (which
      means D3D). We hard-coded the Banshee not to bring up Glide because of the massive
      problems with the current 3dfx Glide 3.X drivers for Banshee. </font></small></p>
