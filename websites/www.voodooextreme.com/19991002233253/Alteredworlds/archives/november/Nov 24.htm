    This should be interesting seeing as how LOL 2 kept me interested for oh, 5 minutes then<font color="#FFFFFF"><strong> I was in Sacrates slumber land</strong></font>. You never know
    with Westwood though....these guys can crack a good game here and there. Here's some
    Trivia, anyone remember the name of the maps I made for RA? If you do I'll send a check
    for $1,000,000.00 that <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>should bounce like a Pimp on his Ho</strong></font>

      before Command &amp; Conquer and its sequels and expansions, Westwood released a fantasy
      adventure/role-playing game called Lands of Lore. And though the immensely popular C&amp;C
      games might be Westwood's bread and butter, there's definitely a soft spot in the

    <small>A big wet one to the guys at <a href="http://www.bgchronicles.com">Baldur's Gate
    Chronicles</a> for putting all the incomprehensible little posts together into <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>one big incomprehensible post</strong></font>. Having said that,
    here's the latest off the Developer's Corner and the Backroom message boards...</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The main protagonist
      is the person who is outlined in the Character Arbitration screen. So, if you are hosting
      a session, you can give someone else the main character/protagonist by changing their name
      to the selected slot. All the hosted server does is host the game. He/she does not have be
      the protagonist. </p>
      <p>Incidently, the person who is at the top right of the character portraits in the game
      screen is the character who leads the party. That is all. He/she can be killed, but unless
      he/she is the main protagonist, the game continues. </p>
      <p>When you export your character, you can give him/her a different name. </p>
      <p>Just to clarify. In BG, we are allowing paladins and rangers 'weapon specialization' -
      the ability to allocate two proficiency points to a weapon category and become a
      'Specialist'. Only fighters can receive ADVANCED weapon specialization - which allows
      three, four or five proficiency points to be allocated to a weapon category so that the
      fighter can become a weapons 'Master, High Master, or Grand Master'. Note that because
      fighters in BG will not be able to achieve 9th level, the highest specialization you will
      be able to achieve in the initial game will be High Master - and that is only if you spend
      all of your additional proficiency points in one weapons category. </p>
      <p>Multiclass fighters can get specialization but not advanced specialization. Dual-class
      fighters are unaffected - if you dual class from a fighter your specializations are frozen
      at the point you dual class. If you dual class to a fighter you can get full advanced
      weapon specialization </p>
      <p>If we could have, we would have released the game about a week ago to get maximum
      holiday impact (note timing on Half-Life, for example). However, the game is simply not at
      the quality level that we are satisfied with yet. It is extremely difficult to sit in on
      numerous meetings around here with everyone pulling out their hair asking &quot;when,
      when, when!?&quot; and not being able to tell them the exact date. We are doing the best
      we can and at least right now - the game is cooperating. </p>
      <p>The Stealth skill (a combination of Hide in Shadows and Move Silently) must be selected
      in order to use. Attempting other actions (besides moving) while it is engaged negates the
      effect. The thief's first attack while hidden causes the effect to end immediately after
      and (if the weapon is suitable) is a backstab. </p>
      <p>A thief's starting abilities vary according to race and dexterity, but a human (no
      racial bonuses) with a dexterity of 13 (no dexterity bonuses) begins with 10% Stealth, 5%
      Find Traps, 15% Pick Pockets, and 10% Open Locks. With racial modifications and the
      maximum dexterity a halfling could have (19), a beginning halfling thief would have 40% in
      Stealth, 20% in Find Traps, 35% in Pick Pockets, and 35% in Open Locks. With a dexterity
      of 13 (no bonuses), they begin with 25%,10%,20%, and 15%, respectively. Needless to say,
      they make very good thieves. </font></small></p>

      very important to Mendelsohn and Garriot was that this game not only give closure to
      long-time Ultima fans, but also open up a new world to Ultima newcomers. You won't have to
      know the history of Ultima to play this game (a beautiful tapestry of history will fill in
      the details), but you will be rewarded for past experiences. Many cities from past Ultimas
      are revisited, and many old friends and foes make their reappearances. The Compatriots are
      back (Iolo, Shamino, and others) and so is Blackthorne. There are over 200 nonplayer
      characters (NPCs) in the game so far, and that number could grow to 250 before the game is
      finished, which should be spring of next year. Of those, some 50 will be characters you
      might have seen in your past adventures as the Avatar.</small></font></p>

    <p><small>Don't get me wrong, FF VII and Parasite Eve are both quality games, if you can
    get FFVII to work on a PC that is. But there is only one word here....Linear. Might and
    magic VI was surely a solid RPG, but it's old Tech. Now I could probably get some
    criticism for the addition of KQ and Thief, but to me, both of them have strong story, are
    non-linear and have strong Tech. And most of all, both of them are <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>breaking
    the mold</strong></font>. King's Quest has killed the old 2D look and gone total 3D and
    Thief, well we all know that. Redguard could and should also be on this list too. Anyway,
    that's my 2 cents.</small></p>

      extremely rare that I have almost given up on the concept. For those who can't read my
      mind, my definition of an epic is a game, which is grand in scope, has complex and
      intelligent dialogue and most importantly has a story comparable to that of a novel. While
      Redguard does have its follies, the quality and expanse of its epic elements brings it far
      above almost all other adventure/RPG games I have ever played. </font></small></p>

    <small>Ah, a nice morning filled with Everquest goodness! Although still no word for Brad,
    he is evil incarnate. Anyway, the<a href="http://www.gamersrepublic.com/11_23_1998n1a.html"> Interview is with Rosie Cosgrove</a>
    and has<font color="#FFFFFF"><strong> some slick screenshots to boot</strong></font>. Head
    &nbsp; on over and check it. Here's a snip.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"><strong>There's a
      deluge of sources from medieval woodcuts and folklore through to Tolkein's bestiaries,
      Dungeons &amp; Dragons and finally to contemporary games such as Diablo. What influenced
      your creations, and how did you decide on the expected forms (such as Trolls and Ogres) of
      the monsters (and characters) the game has a plentiful supply of? </strong><br>
      When I was made lead I had a general idea of the style and appearance of the player
      characters, mostly based on how I would want to look walking around in a fantasy game. I
      wanted them to have richness, depth, and clarity, and the sexiness of super heroes. At
      first I thought they should fall into categories of strong and sexy, funny, or scary. As
      its turned out I don't think they fit into categories at all, maybe because they seem more
      like creatures than caricatures. I think a turning point in the characters was when I
      referred to the first one, a Dark Elf female as &quot;her&quot; instead of &quot;it&quot;.
      For me it seemed like at that moment she became real and in a bizarre way I started kind
      of caring about her. Then again maybe I was just starting to crack from lack of sleep. For
      the monsters, designer Bill Trost, comp artist Rick Schmitz, and I let our imaginations go
      crazy in brainstorming sessions where we wrote long lists of cool monsters. Rick sketched
      up samples and we picked them according to what was best for game play and what was
      coolest. </font></small></p>

    Here's a blurb for you.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <font size="-1"><p></font><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style" size="2">While
      people reading this may deny it (or wish they could with some degree of credibility), many
      gamers come from a tradition of pen and paper RPGs. For such gamers, the promise of a
      D&amp;D game without having to go through the hassles involved (getting everybody in one
      place, finding a good GM, etc&#133;) has always been the holy grail of computer RPGs. The
      main problem faced over the years, of course, is that the computer game worlds in which
      people played lacked the spontaneity and interactivity that could be offered by a pen and
      paper game. This is where the Massively Multiplayer RPG comes in. A relatively new genre
      for the masses, the concept of an online D&amp;D game isn't really that new. Many of the
      most hard-core have been playing free online MUDs, or some of the pay-to-play services
      like <b>Gemstone</b>, for years. <b>Meridian 59</b> and <b>Ultima Online</b> brought
      graphics to the fray and introduced the more casual user to the fun (and trials) of gaming
      with hundreds of people in a virtual world. Everquest is one of the first of the second
      generation of these RPGs and it aims to take the world one step farther than UO: it will
      be fully 3D. </font></p>
