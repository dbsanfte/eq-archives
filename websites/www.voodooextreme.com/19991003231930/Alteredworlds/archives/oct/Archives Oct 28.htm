      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">We are in the final
      push to get the game done.<br>
      <br>
      One of the reasons why Bioware and Chris have not been posting very much lately is because
      they are putting in 16+ hour days to get the game done. We are close... but no cigar (not
      yet).<br>
      <br>
      The final days are the hardest. A bug here, a bug there, can FUBAR the whole process. Add
      in multi-player and 100+ hours of gameplay and you have a finalization nightmare. We have
      our noses to the grindstone however.<br>
      <br>
      We have not encountered anything that would make us feel the need to change our Fall '98
      timing. If we DO change the timing, you will hear about it here FIRST (versus at some
      retailer) and it will only be for the best reasons which will be described IN DETAIL (and
      I guarantee you will understand the reasoning).<br>
      <br>
      But let's keep our collective fingers crossed (I am planning to send some out for
      Christmas gifts to my dad and sisters - bought at the store even)(And don't worry - no way
      they hang out on these bulletin boards)<br>
      <br>
      I just got a new revision today... so I'll be running a new party starting tonight and
      testing all the bugs I found last time around. (P.S. I played for four weeks last time and
      got to mid-chapter 3)</font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left"><small>And here is a very meaty and enlightening post on how close BG is
    to AD&amp;D.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">It is hard to throw
      a number out, but something like 90-95% true to AD&amp;D feels right to me...<br>
      <br>
      AD&amp;D is the greatest RPG ruleset/game of all time. IMHO no computer game will ever
      totally replicate the experience of an awesome campaign being run by an excellent DM.
      However, different doesn't always mean worse.<br>
      <br>
      I can honestly say (after playing the game for a month) that Baldur's Gate is far and away
      the best computer RPG I have ever played. You would expect me to say that as a marketing
      guy and as an employee of the company, but I am sharing my personal opinion here with you
      all. It is so close to AD&amp;D that it is bringing back memories of playing the game with
      my friends back in high school, and that is just with single-player...<br>
      <br>
      There is no way that a computer game will ever be able to manage ALL of the rules within
      AD&amp;D. The pen and paper rules were not designed with computer games in mind. They
      always allowed a great deal of flexibility on the part of the DM. So some rules don't make
      sense within the boundaries of Baldur's Gate, some rules were considered to be so obscure
      as not worth implementing, and some turned out to generate programming/system challenges
      beyond the value to the game.<br>
      <br>
      We have been working very closely with Wizards of the Coast and TSR to ensure that we are
      being true to the spirit of AD&amp;D. They are playtesting the game, are reviewing the
      manual, etc, to help us make this game everything it can be. Bioware has done a tremendous
      job taking a set of game rules that exceeds 700 pages (DM Guide, Players Handbook and
      Monstrous Manual alone) and distilling it to the most important 95% that should be in the
      game.<br>
      <br>
      Ultimately you all will be the final judge. The game will sell well or poorly based on
      your opinions. <br>
      <br>
      We are using this board to share with you any major (in our opinions) areas where we make
      a break with the rules. We ask for opinions because quite frankly some of the best ideas
      come from you. In most cases, AD&amp;D rules will be followed to the letter (either
      visibly, or invisibly behind the scenes). On some occasion they will not. But the point
      is, we want the only surprise when you open the box to be how awesome this game is.<br>
      <br>
      So if you make 9th level as a fighter (ain't gonna happen in BG, but I'm trying to make a
      point here) don't expect 75 armed followers to suddenly spawn at your side :)</font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left"><small>Here's another update on BG's Development status.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Things are moving
      along on schedule, with everyone killing themselves to finish up. If I were to sum up to
      the two biggest challenges to this game getting done they would be:<br>
      <br>
      1) The size of the game itself makes bug hunting and game balancing even more of a
      challenge.<br>
      <br>
      2) Multi-player code. A challenge in the best of times - more of an art than a science.<br>
      <br>
      In case people were worried about the recent announcement from Interplay and any impact it
      might have on staffing at Black Isle, you shouldn't be. Staffing at Black Isle actually
      increased slightly.</font></small></p>

    <small>Noticed over at VN that they have got some saucy goodness on a few interesting
    reactions to Desslock's U:A article yesterday. Bob White and Mike Mcshaffry both sent
    along their opinions on it. Take into account there was a real Tissy fit when these guys
    left the scene over at OSI to go off to &quot;Greener&quot; pastures. Here's a small
    blurb, for the full meaty goodness head on over to <a href="http://www.vaultnetwork.com/">VN</a>.</small></p>
    <i><blockquote>
      <p></i><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The interview gave me a sense
      of optimism about Ultima IX. I know Origin (and everyone else) would rather have me call
      it U:A; but give me break it was always Ultima IX to me. Besides, I think its great to see
      the cool Roman numeral for nine there, it showcases the longevity of the series. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">I remember the meeting where we
      specifically sat down to reverse engineer the connecting fiction of the previous Ultima
      games. It wasn't difficult to do at all and the outcome was surprising and very cool. I
      get the feeling that this core metafiction is still living, so I won't give it away. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">I'm also glad Richard mentions
      bringing back old artifacts and characters. When I was working on the project this was
      something I really wanted to see, and something that I knew the hard core Ultima fans
      would like to see too. It isn't difficult or expensive to do but it does require people on
      the project to remember what all those things were and how they relate to the story. As
      Richard said in the interview, the Ultima fans are invaluable in recalling all those
      tidbits.</font></small></p>

    action at E3 when the designers were playing MP against each other. They called it
    &quot;Dragonmatching&quot;. I was 100% tuned! Just to watch your Dragon breathe long flame
    strikes at another &quot;Friend&quot; and watch as they pummel helplessly to the ground
    thrashing all the way down. It's beautifull! I can honestly say this game will have kick
    ass Multiplayer! Possibly redefining how we play it in some respects. Totally inventive

      <p></font><font size="2" color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Surreal software, the
      team behind the highly anticipated fantasy fly-about, Drakan, is convinced that
      multiplaying is the future of the games industry. Drakan involves multiplayer elements
      that may push the boundaries of realism just a little bit further. &quot;There is definite
      merit to the conclusion that multiplaying is the future of the games industry,&quot;
      stated Stuart Denman of Surreal. &quot;Surreal hopes to be a pioneer in that area,
      starting with Drakan: Order of the Flame. Once bandwidths start increasing, we'll see
      increased realism in multiplayer games, especially when people are able to speak to one
      another over the network. Drakan is already showing advances in animation, where you can
      see other players move and attack with more fidelity than ever before.&quot; Surreal is
      &quot;shooting for a release some time in the first quarter of &#145;99.&quot;</font></p>

    <small>Ah....another tasty <a href="http://www.agn3d.com/">Trespasser Review </a>comes our
    way. This time it comes from the Muffin boys over at AGN 3D. They gave it some pretty good
    ratings which is a good thing since my copy should be in the mail today or so. Also it has
    been spotted in stores now so you can expect to see many more reviews as they come in. </small></p>
    <font color="#276fa1" face="Verdana" size="2"><blockquote>
      <p></font><font size="2" color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Trespasser can be an
      amazingly entertaining game. Figuring out the many puzzles is really satisfying. Usually
      the puzzles involve using the physics engine to your advantage like when you flip a
      trailer over and use it to gain access to the adjacent buildings' roof. The neat thing
      about it is that the trailer falls differently every time. Sometimes it rolls completely
      wrong and it's useless in helping you gain access to the roof. Other games have sequences
      similar to this but the difference is that they are scripted. When you script something
      there is no chance of a random outcome. In Trespasser, whatever happens, happens. If it
      screws up your chances to finish a level, then you have to reload a savegame and try
      again. </font></p>

    just for you. As always, AW will pass this Salty goodness along to you. First he talks
    about character body types. And the rest is all talk about shipping etc. We'll skip that.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The only new
      character body type that the Player character will have is in the New Power armor. The
      other new armor in the game is using the existing player character body types, just with
      different statistics.</font></small></p>

    <small>Luke was hittin the boards yesterday like a bottle of Jack Daniels. He has some
    good BG blurbs that you'll want to read up on like always. The first one is on Character
    class combos etc.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">But it won't change
      anything for the main release, and I still don't think it will change a lot for the
      future. EG, it mentions Ranger/cleric (druid), which aside from these rules appears to be
      a special class of one specific goddess and intentionally rare(Meilikki). The multi
      clearly breaches the alignments of both individual classes (some form of good for rangers,
      and true neutral for druids). Such special-case classes may be inappropriate for the
      context of BG(along with some exotic races), even though they appear in the PHB or other
      sources(though I did miss that. Ah well. You do what you can :)<br>
      <br>
      Anyway, we will likely not have every class and combination available, though we will
      continue to try to cover as wide a field as we can within the context of the game we are
      trying to make.</font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left"><small>His next bit is on Spellbooks and Bard's with Armor.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">1, spellbooks in BG
      are not physical entities, they are part of your character. So, yes your bard has a
      &quot;spellbook,&quot; but he cannot place spells within it until he is able to use them.
      Does he start with spells? No, he must find/buy them and transcribe them in once he
      reaches second level (his first spellcasting level).<br>
      <br>
      2, Nope, bards cannot currently cast while wearing armor. We had considered this at one
      point, but deemed it unnecessary. In BG, no class will be able to cast mage spells in any
      type of armor.</font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left"><small>Continuing the Bard discussion:</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The PHB specifically
      states that the bard must obey the restrictions on wearing armor and casting spells. We
      did consider allowing this at one point (I think it's an optional rule, but I'm not sure
      of the source), but we found that it just wasn't necessary. The Bard is quite useful as
      is, and switching armor in BG is relatively easy regardless(though admittedly dangerous in
      combat).<br>
      <br>
      So the class is not &quot;Trashed,&quot; we are just not using the optional rules your DM
      opted for.</font></small></p>

    <small>Whew, yesterday wasn't actually very productive in terms of RPG love but hopefully
    things will change around today. If there are any astute AW visitors out there who have
    taken notice, you'll see we added 3 new HOT banners to our selection. Thank Bowmeister for
    those beasties. Also, it's lookin good that we're going to start up an AW Reviews section
    very soon as there are going to be quite a few RPG's released in the next few weeks. We
    never opened a Reviews section before since there was nothing much to Review. And because
    our Altered Reviewer was a chimp in disguise so we had to let him go back to the Zoo. With
    that said, myself, Bowmeister and Madbard (Who basically act like humans disguised as
    chimps) will be kicking out some tasty stuff. Hopefully Kairn will come up for some air as
    soon as he's released from Jail.</small></p>

    <small>Was over at Billy's Love Shack (VE) and noticed that IDGN have poofed up a nice <a href="http://www.3dgaming.net/previews/adventure/mask_of_eternity/">Preview</a> of an
    incredibly sweet looking gem of a game. It has all the &quot;Under the counter&quot; lovin
    you guys are used to so head on over and keep your monitors clean. </small></p>

      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Roberta simply puts
      it as this: </font><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080FF"><i>&quot;... since the
      overwhelming advent of 3D &quot;action-type&quot; games (plus the advent of more
      'mass-market' computer owners), gamers are more into quick gratification and lots of
      movement and action&#133;and games which don't require a lot of thought or really deep or
      difficult puzzles.&quot;</i></font><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"> That's
      why Roberta has taken a completely different turn for her latest game, King's Quest VIII.
      Now, not to be cynical, but I feared this moment more than any other -- the day that
      Sierra would be forced to sell out their greatest series of all to the mainstream computer
      game industry. I'm entirely positive though, from what I've seen, that they'll pull
      through. </font></small></p>

    <small>Game Worlds Network has just smacked up a nice <a href="http://www.gameworlds.com/misc/deusex.html">Dues Ex Interview</a> with Bob White and
    Harvey Smith. Don't worry, my interview is with neither of them, it's with someone much
    higher on the Totem Pole of Love. Here's an excerpt from Witchboy:</small></p>
    <font color="#800000"><blockquote>
      <p></font><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">We will have the player
      returning to maps numerous times. Each time, something interesting will happen. The maps
      are dynamic. In Paris, you can return to the Metro Station Block several times. Each time,
      things are slightly changed--characters move around, leave, architecture has changed,
      stores open and close, etc. In fact, the world will be set up to show the changes of the
      larger plot as you progress. In many cases, this involves creating multiple versions of a
      single map. Which is pretty easy for us, since once you create the bulk of the map, the
      minor variations are quicker to put into place. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">In Deus Ex, the world is
      extremely interactive. You can pick up a chair and throw it across the room, push it out
      of the way, carry it with you, destroy it, etc. Objects can be picked up and added to
      inventory, etc. If you shoot out glass in a map, then return a week later, someone will
      have replaced the glass. In other cases, we will save the state of the world. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The game also allows for
      branching and multiple forms of NPC reaction. (If you shoot Nicolette's boyfriend and she
      hears about it, she will react very differently to you than if you choose to be more
      noble.) </font></small></p>
