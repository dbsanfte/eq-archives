    <small>Whew, it feels like I just gave birth to a multiheaded Baboon. There was plenty of
    news to go around today. All in all I would say a pretty damn good day to go public with
    the new AW. Our boy Kairn got the old Balony Pony treatment with a flood. Nothing like
    living in Florida at times eh? He should be back on track soon. Anyway, Trespasser is
    looking so close I can feel the Raptor farts now. That game is gonna be totally golden
    when it gets released. Of all the games I saw at E3, this one truly defied explanation.
    All you could really say when watching it, was that it was real. Anyway, looks like I
    sucked all the RPG news down faster than Monica could....er, I think i'll skip that last
    part. Keep checking back for more.</small></p>

      <p align="left"></b><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">on multi-player:
      Deus Ex is primarily a single player game, but we will have some multi-player missions as
      well. They will most likely be special cooperative missions that take place on special
      maps that capitalize on our unique gameplay elements. I'm not saying that we won't have
      deathmatch, but it's really not a very high priority at this stage of development. Deus Ex
      is about character interaction and development, problem solving, and exploration... it's
      not just a mindless shooter. Our combat system is also very realistic - if you get shot in
      the leg, you won't be as mobile and dexterous. If you get shot in the arm, your aim won't
      be as accurate. All of the NPCs will also react according to where they have been hurt. As
      far as the problems with Unreal's networking, Tim is working very hard to address all of
      the issues that have surfaced lately. We will integrate all of Tim's new networking code
      when it is available.</font></small></p>

    <small>Thanks everyone for all the great comments so far on the site. I have gotten a ton
    of E mail from a lot of you biological units out there. (Keep em comin) Let me spew off a
    quick explanation on why we made the changes so everyone knows. The Primary reason for the
    change was bandwidth. The old page loaded like Grandma Jones on her Tricycle riding uphill
    to the Grocery store at times. Hopefully she's riding downhill now! :) We also wanted a
    more Professional feel, yet retain the old flavor of the page. Although what flavor that
    would be I am uncertain. Probably better than Tuna flavored Bubble Gum i'm sure. Anyway,
    keep the suggestions and comments coming and hope you enjoy what we have planned in the
    future. </small></p>

    <small>Welcome to the new and Improved Altered Worlds everyone! We are still hard at work
    adding the finishing touches and we expect to go through a few more changes before
    anything stabalizes. Please feel free to send us your comments etc. In certain sections
    you'll notice we keep our old format, live with it! It's a pain in the ass to convert the
    whole thing so for the old stuff we just left it as is. Anything new will be using the new
    format though. </small></p>

    <small>Well now, here is one tasty looking game! I was lucky enough to sit down and <a href="interviews/Septerra%20Int..htm">talk with Brian Babendererde</a> on Septerra Core of
    which he is the Lead Designer on. If that isn't enough check out a few Exclusive shots for
    the game we thought you'd like to see! </small></p>
