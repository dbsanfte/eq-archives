    <small>Ken Levine was on the<a href="http://130.233.233.5/cgi-bin/systemshock2.pl">
    Unofficial System Shock Boards</a> spreading a little lovin our way. Sounds like this gem
    is coming along nicely. There's a whole lot of SS goodness here gang so <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>sit back, relax, grab a frosty cold one and enjoy</strong></font>.
    Here's the first one on story elements etc.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Thanks for this great thread.
      We've put A LOT of thought into the story. For better or worse, I spent my youth (well, it
      was only a few years ago) as a screenwriter in LA, and I am generally disappointed by most
      computer game stories because they are so on the nose and derivative. On the other hand, I
      think it's perhaps impossible to judge whether a story will be good or not based on the
      time frame it is set in. Given the sentence, &quot;It all started 40 years after the mess
      on Citadel station&quot; you, I or anyone on this board can come up with around a thousand
      different storylines, some of them good, some of them bad, some of them horrible, some of
      them great. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The tenets we've followed in
      developing the storyline are to keep the vibe consistent with the first game, to make the
      game creepy, to &quot;progress&quot; the settings of Shock 1 and expand the world to make
      it feel more real, and to utilize our numerous storytelling tools (cutscenes, email, logs,
      etc.) to feedback that storyline in a way that only the System Shock game design allows
      us. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">I think I can say that many
      elements of the story will suprise you. But we are not out to re-invent the wheel. Shock 2
      will feel like Shock 1, but with much more advanced technology, gameplay and storytelling
      techniques. </font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>The next one is on what is missing from the System Shock game engine.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">First, let me see if I can
      cleverly turn this question around. I might ask a similar question.&quot;What is missing
      from Quake 3?&quot; </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">1) RPG: Character generation,
      development, skills and stats that actually affect the gameplay, experience points,
      traits, etc. <br>
      2)Gameplay: Rich storyline, logs, story relevant cutscenes (?), hacking, configuring,
      modifying, repairing, varied quests, and other elements too numerous to mention (think
      Shock 1 plus plus plus plus) <br>
      3) Engine: I'll use your notes: </font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>Next one is on rotating platforms and moving objects being a trigger or
    transparent.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"><small>Yes to all the above. A moving
      object can be a trigger, transparent, translucent, have various levels of translucency. I
      think the object system in this engine is, without a doubt, materially the most powerful
      object system in any first person game. The amount of control is absolutely incredible,
      and completely from a designer side. Each object can have one or more of 500 plus
      paremeters (I've never counted them all, I think there might be more) set on them from
      whether it is a &quot;trap&quot; to its physics shape, to its sensitivity to arbitrary
      stimuli (hot, cold, noise, whatever you see fit). It really is (no hyperbole here) a
      marvel of modern game software engineering. </small></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>Finally in recap to this thread.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">We're here to help. I just want
      to put my two cents here that while Shock 2's engine does stand up well to shooters, we
      really don't view them as our competition. It's sort of like comparing Quake 3 to Might
      and Magic 6 or Fallout (which is a great game in its own right. We're a rich RPG that
      happens to be blessed with a really powerful engine with an object system that supports
      really untapped types of gameplay. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">It's nice to have your cake and
      eat it, too. </font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>Next he talks about the Paperdoll.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The paperdoll really comes from
      earlier games like Underworld 1 and many others. Even XCOM and Jagged Alliance used these
      elements. The look of Syndicate is similar, but, hey, the look of Shock 1 and Syndicate is
      similar. They're both inspired by the same kind of fiction (cyberpunk, dark future stuff) </font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>Talking about lack of new design.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">If you mean &quot;graphical
      design&quot;, there are two things to think about. 1) None of these screenshots are final,
      shipping images. 2) We have a debt to stay faithful to Shock 1. As a sequel, you are bound
      to give people a similar vibe to the first experience. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">If you mean game design, I think
      one really needs to sit down with the game before they can accurately assess that. You are
      only seeing a tiny corner of the interface elemetns. There are literally dozens of
      multifunction displays that appear in these interface areas, with a corresponding wide
      range of functionality. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. </font></small></p>

    <small>Here's a bit of wacky goodness that those chimps at Bioware have been doing instead
    of working on the game. At least it's slightly more interesting than the bug with <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>the Halfling urinating on prostitutes</strong></font> in the game.
    That raggedy muffin ass Scott Greig posted this piece. Enjoy.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Actually, Ross
      didn't kill Kenny but he did kill Drizzt. <br>
      <br>
      He was wondering if it should be possible to kill Drizzt so he looked at the pen and paper
      stats in the rule books, and worked out that his sixth level character had a remote chance
      of killing Drizzt. Since we have given Drizzt all the offical attributes and abilities,
      Ross figured that he should be able to do this in the game.<br>
      <br>
      Thus armed with his theoretical workable stratagy (and many reloads) he was able to kill
      the dark elf ranger. Ross's party did take a reputation hit, but after considering the
      really nifty items that they got, this is definitly a must try for all evil parties. Be
      warned that attacking Drizzt is one of the fasted ways in the game to get your entire
      party killed.</font></small><br>

    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Well, UO has made history! (sort
      of) In the recently release Guinness Book of Records 1999, Ultima Online was included as
      the Most People on an Internet Game at a time. Basically it said that UO sold far more
      copies than expected, and that its been the most populated Internet game ever. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">I just thought that this was

    that Easter egg soon. Here's a snip. (RPG News.com)</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Fallout 2 is much
      like the previous Fallout. You have the same basic game structure and engine, with only
      minor improvements. I suppose, since there is so much going on and so many missions to
      complete, that it merits being a whole new $50 game. But I would have liked to see a new
      graphics/sound/music engine for my $50. I really did like the first game, but companies
      should really not get away with not keeping up with graphics standards being set by the
      rest of the industry. I'll just say this: If you liked the first game, you'll like this
      game. It is more of the same, but the first one was good enough to merit a sequel, and
      this, so far, hasn't been a bad sequel.</font></small></p>

      Sierra hammered the game as well as just about every living soul at Pyrotechnix, and a few
      outside beta sites were also employed. </font></small></p>

      issues of QA have been addressed. The last week or so has been taken up mostly with
      questions of play balanacing and fine tuning, rather than computer-killer/system crashing

    <small>Damn, I have never been what you would call an Ultima fan. But I would call myself
    a fan of Richard Garriott for his superb sense in game design. He is one of the masters
    and you can see it in his work. There is a real sense of purpose and logic behind his
    games and not just you running around choking the chicken. Anyway, you chimps know that
    when I get stoked on something I let it be known. Well, I am stoked on this little piece
    that Garriott wrote. (Below) <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>It's good to see people taking
    a philosophical appraoch</strong></font> (Pardon the pun) to game design more and more
    lately. We already have too many balding fat turds in suits in the Industry as it is.

    come out of that? Civ-Ulti-Quake or something. Anyway go read this little piece if you
    thought Warren Spector's was any good yesterday, this one is great. Here's a sneak peak.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The plot lines in
      most RPG&#146;s are basically the same old drivel, over and over again. I call it the
      standard RPG plot. I think you will find it familiar: You start the game as the great
      hero. (You know this because you are told so in the instructions.) You job is to kill the
      big evil guy. (Also, from the instructions.) You pillage and plunder everyone and
      everything to become strong for your final battle. (Of course the supposed bad guy is
      doing no evil right now, but you sure are.) When ready at last, you kill the &#147;bad
      guy&#148; who has been sitting there peacefully waiting. <br>
      <br>
      Well, after 3 games of my own that retold this story, combined with all that
      introspection, I was ready for something more. I felt that role-playing would be even
      stronger in a more realistic setting. I felt that people are basically good, not merely
      for fear of some divine being, but because it was logical. Thus was born the modern Ultima
      design. I was really worried before we released Ultima IV: Quest of the Avatar, that
      people might think I&#146;d gone off the philosophical deep end, but instead, it was my
      first best selling game. <br>
      <br>
      Ultimas since then have had a deep sense of ethics, which I carefully separate from
      morals. By my definition, Ethics are logically based, while Morals are religion based.
      Thus, if you object to pre-marital sex because it is against God&#146;s laws, that&#146;s
      Morality; if you oppose it because of the risk of unwanted pregnancies, that&#146;s an
      Ethic. I do not subscribe to any Morals, yet believe I am a very Ethical person. </font></small></p>

    <small>Yup you just read that right, <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Your eyes aren't
    deceiving you</strong></font>. It's very possible that we could be seeing 3D card use in
    BG Expansion packs etc, similar to what Diablo is doing. Using it for frame rate
    improvement and lighting affects etc. Check this post out by Mark Brockington, programmer
    for BG. Check it.</small></p>

    Asheron's Call</a> that you'll defenitely want to see. Now you may be wondering, why the

    same thing until I saw this beast running at E3. <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Great
    Interface and graphics </strong></font>don't look bad at all, and they also recently
    announced that they were going to add acceleration to this badass mofo. That good enough

    Interview</a>. Not extremely long but hell, it's always good to hear more smack on this
    game than we had before. They also touch on the fact that this isn't really focussed
    towards RPG gamers etc. I agree with that evaluation and the reason we cover it here is
    because of it's Fantasy theme and atmosphere. This game gives off such a suspension of
    disbelief, almost <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>makes you feel like your on the back of

      <p><font size="2" color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Stephen Patt.: There will be
      two different types of Drakan Multi-player in the box: Deathmatch and something
      tentatively called &quot;Queen of the Dragon&quot;. Deathmatch play actually has two
      variations: Ground combat only (i.e. no dragon) with sword-to-sword combat only, and
      aerial combat which includes ground combat, but truthfully we don't expect anyone to hop
      off their dragon for sword-to-sword play when there are other dragons flapping around! The
      second mode, &quot;Queen of the Dragon&quot; will have up to 8 people on the ground and
      only one dragon.&nbsp; Everyone will be fighting sword-to-sword, while trying to find the
      Dragon's soul crystal.&nbsp; Whoever finds the soul crystal can then approach the dragon
      without getting instantly toasted, mount the dragon, and rain fire down on all of the
      other players, raking up the kills!</font></p>
