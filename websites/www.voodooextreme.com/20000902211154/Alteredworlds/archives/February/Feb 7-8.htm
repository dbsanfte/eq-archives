    <small>Hold yer horses. I'll have some news up soon. Have been extremely busy on the
    courts today and haven't had time to update. Check back later for the Beef. Now that I
    can't play Everquest at the moment I have just realized how incredibly good Baldur's Gate
    really is. The guys at Bioware pulled off everything they said they would which happens
    very rarely in this Industry. Check back soon for the goods. PS. Is there anyone out there
    who has recieved their copy of Beta 4 kind enough to send a copy of their patch executable
    file. It's only 80 kb so just copy it as an attatchment and send via E mail if you could.
    It won't say patch, prolly something like Everquest something or other. It's the actual
    file you use to start EQ. Please send me a copy. I'll tell Billy to bring over a Tub of
    Crisco and get busy on ya if you do.</small></p>

      Following last year's immensely popular Might and Magic VI The Mandate of Heaven, For
      Blood and Honor maintains the rich legacy of classic role-playing that made the Might and
      Magic series so successful while adding technological advances such as 3D acceleration.<br>
      <br>
      Other new features include monster vs. monster combat, fully digitized character faces,
      multiple races, improved combat movement and automapping.<br>

      capability the genre hasn't exactly taken great strides for the better. Sure, you take a
      game like Baldur's Gate and you can't argue about its quality and graphics. But how many

      progressing and is looking fantastic. We had to re-write some of our technology but it was
      well worth it and has brought a whole new feel to the game. Its much faster, so looks
      smoother. Technically we have many more new features that we can use to bring the world
      alive and the game/story elements are being implemented continuously, as we speak. As you
      can appreciate, the game and story elements are the bulk of the work and takes time to

    <small>I haven't even left Faydwer yet, and that is not the largest Continent. There is no

      <p><strong><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">This is true. We are
      shipping with approximately 70 zones, as opposed to the (much) earlier plan of 40 or so.

    <small>Here is just a quick example of what misinformation can do to you. Not only that
    but I think this guy is an AOL user. Not that there is anything wrong with AOL mind you..
    (Snicker) Here's Brad dishing the deal out.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">a: I don't have the techincal
      support for EQ. When your poor like me, you can't afford the MINIMUM SYSTEM REQUIREMENT of
      a 3d accelerator. Even with a 3d card, it is going to lag like hell. </font></small></p>
      <p><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"><strong><small>Nope -- a game like this
      being 3d or 2d has little to nothing to do with lag. </small></strong></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>Brad, you are so kind. Let me step in here. <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>What
    are you Nuts</strong></font>?! Can't afford a 3D card?! This, my friends is the perfect
    example of drug induced posting. Hell, you can buy a Voodoo under $40 now and a V2 under
    $100. As for the lag issue, this guy is totally uninformed. (He obviously didn't read my
    Preview) There is little to no lag in this game so far at all. </small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Right now, in beta, you have
      what...a few hundred people with a graphic engine near quake II quality? Imagine when it
      releases 1500 per server (the max...to low in my opinion), with 28.8 connections, low rate
      3d card, lag everywhere. </font></small></p>
      <p><strong><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Nope. During phase 3 of
      testing we had 1700 people on a server, with all sorts of connections, 3d cards, etc.
      There was NOT 'lag everywhere'. In fact, people are pretty blown away as to how lag
      resistant EQ is. </font></small></strong></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>This guy could make a living talking out of his ass! (Not you Brad :)) Let's put
    it this way, just visit a Bank in UO sometime and you will learn what Lag is. Put 20
    players on screen at once in EQ may cause a little graphic slowdown but not much lag. 1500
    players IMHO is perfect.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">: B: UO is a rpg. EQ is a rpg. UO
      is faster, original, has more of a rpg aspect (Can we say virtual economy? I haven't heard
      that word from anyone in EQ). </font></small></p>
      <p><strong><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Depends what you mean by
      a 'virtual economy'. We have a 'player-driven economy' that depends on tried and true
      principles such as supply and demand. </font></small></strong></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>UO is faster? How can he say this when he hasn't played EQ may I ask? More of an
    RPG aspect? Yeah I guess PKilling with a few 12 year olds does add to the realism of the
    game. Virtual Economy? Please, it was a failed attempt at trying to be too realistic.
    Virtual Economy means squat when it's not fun.<font color="#FFFFFF"><strong> This is a
    game for god's sake not Wall Street</strong></font>!</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Plus i've already devoted enough
      of my time to this great game<br>
      : so if you want to go and complain about Uo and how EQ is god, go to www.eqvault.com...we
      don't want your kind here. </font></small></p>
      <p><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"><strong><small>Well, I can respect that,
      however I can't stand by and let misinformation about EQ float around either.</small></strong></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>UO &quot;WAS&quot; a great game. I enjoyed the hell out of it. But it failed to
    live up to it's expectations. Lag is still an issue. (Not in EQ) Bugs are still an issue.
    (Yes, in EQ also but it's still Beta and most of them are fairly minor balancing issues)
    This may sound very Pro EQ and it is, but the plain and simple fact of the matter is UO is
    outdated old Tech. I enjoyed it while it lasted.&nbsp; </small></p>

            Tribes also has that same quality. BG does the same in all respects. All I know is that
