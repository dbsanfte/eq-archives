    By the Sultan of Smack: <a href="mailto:sacrates@voodooextreme.com">Sacrates</a><br>
    With: Stuart Denman</small></em></p>
    <p align="left"><em><small>There are times in a gamers life that come close to religious
    experiences. That moment when you feel almost total immersion into a games environment.
    The moment when even a good Blow up Doll will loose it's luster. I have seen the light and
    it's name is Drakan. Haven't you ever wondered after reading all those Fantasy novels what
    it would be like to ride on the back of a Dragon? Let us take you on a ride into the world
    of Drakan.</small></em></p>
    <hr>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">Sacrates: </font>Alright, let's hit the basics first. Who the
    heck are you and what the heck are you doing? (position on the team etc.)</p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">Stu:</font> Most of the work I've done has been game and graphics
    programming on my own and with Surreal for almost 14 years.&nbsp; After graduating with a
    Computer Engineering degree (specializing in computer graphics) at the University of
    Washington, I started Surreal with three other founders.&nbsp; My official label of the
    month is Vice President and Technical Director, but my main duties are as Lead Programmer
    on Drakan.</p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">Sacrates: </font>Just the name Drakan gets me all warm and fuzzy
    without the use of Alcoholic beverages or mind altering drugs. How do you think this game
    will stand up in todays 3D market? (For those of us that don't know about it)</p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">Stu:</font> You can do some pretty crazy moves when flying Arokh
    that areguaranteed to give you a good head-rush.&nbsp; We've made every aspect of Drakan,
    from the graphics to the sound, to the gameplay a unique and mind-blowing
    experience.&nbsp; Drakan is not a copycat game, you can't really compare it as a whole to
    other games, so it will easily rock the 3D competition.</p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">Sacrates: </font>Alright let's start slapping the Engine around a
    little bit.<br>
    Starting with the basics first. Do you guys expect to support Voodoo 3 and will the game
    utilize any of it's newer features? I assume it will already be running the V2 card on the
    mouse wheel at full throttle.</p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">Stu:</font> We're definitely supporting all the high-end cards
    with bountifulgraphic elegance like high-polygon counts and over 10 MB of high-resolution
    true-color textures per level.&nbsp; Of course, the engine can scale down these figures
    for lower-end machines so you'll still be able to play great with a Voodoo 1 or
    Riva128.&nbsp; The engine also support lots of jucy multi-texturing effects like colored
    shadow/light-maps and detail textures.&nbsp; Voodoo3 and TNT do this in a single-pass.</p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">Sacrates: </font>Will there be Bump mapping and any other of the
    pretty V2/V3 features added?</p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">Stu:</font> Bump mapping will hopefully be supported for at least
    the characters. It's a time issue, so we're hoping to fit it in.&nbsp; Detail texturing
    and other single-pass multitexturing effects are already looking amazing!</p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">Sacrates:</font> I got to play a bit of this beast at E3 earlier
    this year and<br>
    although crashed your machines twice enjoyed doing it immensely. (playing the game that is
    ;)) I noticed the play mechanics were kind of awkward at the time. Using the keyboard etc,
    will this game support all kinds of various input devices such as Keyboards, Joysticks,
    Mice, etc etc.</p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">Stu:</font> Yes, those devices will be supported.&nbsp; Our
    controls are almost exactly like Quake, with the addition of 'up' and 'down' keys for
    Arokh, which double as jump and crouch when controlling Rynn.&nbsp; Other movement keys
    are strafe left-right, forward-back, and walk (sneak).&nbsp; All controls are customizable
    and can be assigned to joystick/mouse buttons instead of keys. Surreal is big on controls,
    if a game is inconsistent and hard to control, then it is usually not very fun to play!</p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">Sacrates: </font>Can we expect any kinds of Interesting weather
    effects in the game such as Rain, Snow, strong winds etc. Will there be any kind of
    turbulance that the dragon will hit while flying in the air?</p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">Stu: </font>Yes!&nbsp; We have wind, rain with fractal lightning
    striking the ground in 3D (right in front of you sometimes), and snow that looks
    incredibly realistic!&nbsp; Flying through the snow with Arokh looks amazing!</p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">Sacrates:</font> I noticed the great looking waterfalls in the
    game while flying around. Will the Drakan engine support rippling water, possibly adding
    waves also?</p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">Stu:</font> The tropical islands have lots of wave effects in the
    oceans.&nbsp; For rivers and streams, I've created a procedural water effect that creates
    waves and interference patterns in the water.&nbsp; Water also creates caustic reflections
    on the walls and ceilings of caves, which is very cool.</p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">Sacrates: </font>What kind of environmental effects can we expect
    other than rain etc. Will there be birds (Other than dragons) flying in the skies or
    simple animals on the ground to add to the atmoshphere?</p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">Stu:</font> Yes, Tim has created a flocking AI that we use for
    birds, fish, bats, and bees, which are mostly ambient.&nbsp; We also have yak-like
    creatures that the locals (in Drakan) keep.&nbsp; They run away if you try to hurt them.
    Scavengers aren't really ambient because they attack you, but they cruise around and
    search for dead things to eat.</p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">Sacrates:</font> How many types of environments will there be in
    the game? So far I have only noticed a few types, specifically the mountanous areas etc.</p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">Stu:</font> Yeah, there have only been screenshots of the
    mountain areas, but the game has mountains, snowy mountains, mines, tropical islands,
    underground river, volcanic, and one other world that we aren't revealing yet. </p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">Sacrates: </font>Will there be day and night effects in the game
    and what kind of lighting will you be using in the engine? Strobe lights, lens flares,
    shadowing etc?</p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">Stu: </font>Yes, lighting will change depending on the time of
    day and weather (fog, also).&nbsp; We have dynamic lights with varying qualities (like
    caustic reflections for cave water).&nbsp; We also have other goodies like lens flares,
    full-screen lighting effects, and dynamic shadows that crawl along surfaces and actually
    follow the light sources!&nbsp; Our real-time character lighting is the best we've seen in
    any game to date, all seamless on our single-skin characters.</p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">Sacrates:</font> Obviously a popular question. What will the
    system requirements be for Drakan and what kind of Frame rates can we expect?</p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">Stu: </font>Minimum requirements are a Pentium 166 with at least
    a Voodoo 1 or Riva128.&nbsp; Frame rate on this low-end machine is 15-20+, but the
    recommended spec is a Pentium 233 with Voodoo 2 or TNT where we're getting 30-40 FPS with
    shadows and all multi-texturing effects turned on.</p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">Sacrates:</font> Will the Interface be fairly customizable? And
    will we be able to control all of our video settings and features?</p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">Stu:</font> Of course.&nbsp; Any command in the game can be bound
    to any key or mouse/joystick button.&nbsp; Tons of video and graphics settings can be
    tweaked to get optimal look and performance on whatever machine you're running.</p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">Sacrates: </font>A very popular question at the moment especially
    after the release of Half Life which did things with sound that have never been done so
    well before. Can we expect full 3D sound support in Drakan and what standard will you
    support? Both A3D and EAX? Personally I use EAX so when you send me an evaluation/demo
    copy of Drakan (hint hint.....) make sure you have it in there for me. :)</p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">Stu:</font> Yes, Drakan supports full 3D Sound with Doppler
    effects and support for both Creative Labs EAX and Aureal cards. At COMDEX, Creative Labs
    was using Drakan to show off EAX. When Rynn walks into a cave, for example, the sounds of
    her footsteps, water dripping, etc., all take on an eerie echo effect. </p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">Sacrates: </font>Do you guys plan on having an open sort of Beta
    test for Drakan's Multiplayer or will it be closed?<br>
    </p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">Stu: </font>It's a closed beta, sorry. But there will be a public
    demo closer to when it is released.</p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">Sacrates: </font>What type of combat can we expect to see?
    Traditional sword fighting on the ground or dropping Dragon dung from the sky? (Hey could
    be affective for something with very strong sense of smell like my girlfriend for example)</p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">Stu: </font>Our sword fighting combat is more fast paced action
    sword-fighting.&nbsp; We use Quake-style controls, so there's a lot of dodging, strafing,
    and rolling.&nbsp; We focus more on movement than having hundreds of attacks.&nbsp; We
    have around 10 different sword attacks, then lots of evasive moves that can create more
    attacks like crouching, crouching rolls, flips, flip and reverse (all in every direction).
    &nbsp; We also have several different bow and arrow attacks.&nbsp; Oh, and don't forget
    spells, including earthquake, lightning, ring of fire, tornado, and a few other surprises.</p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">Sacrates: </font>Can we expect to hear environmental music at
    all? Will the music change according to what is happening? I noticed one thing while at
    the Drakan booth at E3...you guys had a killer high fantasy track kicking in there. Will
    it be that type of music?</p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">Stu: </font>The game will use DirectMusic and has a powerful
    fantasy style to it, but the music is mostly being used to add mood and to enhance the
    gameplay experience.&nbsp; In general, we want the player to feel like they are truly
    within the world of Drakan by letting them hear ambient sounds like birds, rivers, and
    distant creatures.</p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">Sacrates:</font> How open will the game be? It seemed like I
    could fly anywhere when I played a bit of it. Will it be like Trespasser with large open
    areas but on a fairly linear path. Or will it be totally open to exploration?</p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">Stu: </font>There are large open areas with different paths, but
    the paths where you can go are pretty distinct.&nbsp; Most levels have a map, so it's hard
    to get lost.&nbsp; Each area has a lot to explore before you have to open up the next
    area.&nbsp; For example, the islands levels are pretty open for exploration, but the story
    leads you to want to fly to particular islands.</p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">Sacrates: </font>Will there be different types of Dragons in the
    game and will we be able to customize them before playing in Multiplayer? Color, weight,
    speed, etc etc.</p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">Stu:</font> Drakan has several different dragon skins for
    multiplayer, including Arokh, a Skeletal Dragon, and others.&nbsp; These hulking dragons
    also show up in the single-player game.&nbsp; You won't be able to customize their speeds,
    as that would be cheating, and nobody likes a cheater.&nbsp; You can pick up all kinds of
    killer dragon-breath weapons, however, which relies more on skill and sheer determination!
    &nbsp; </p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">Sacrates: </font>How will this game appeal to many RPG fans since
    it seems more on an adventure action path? Will there be inventory and NPC interaction
    etc?</p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">Stu:</font> The NPC interactions are done through in-game
    cut-scenes using the 3D engine.&nbsp; We have a full Diablo-style interface with all kinds
    of weapons and items to collect.&nbsp; Weapons have damage, durability, magic effects, and
    other statistics.&nbsp; Items are used for quests and spell casting, which should be
    another thing RPG fans love!</p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">Sacrates: </font>That will about cap it off. One last thing,
    about how far are you into development at the moment percentage wise? When can we expect
    to seeDrakan on shelves. (Don't say when it's done please!)</p>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">Stu: </font>We're about 80% done, and we're looking at an April
    '99 worldwide release!</p>
