      Publishing Agreement with Former Members of Diablo Development Team; Deal with
      Newly-Formed Click Entertainment Demonstrates Acclaim's Commitment to PC Gaming</b> </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">GLEN COVE, N.Y. -- March 9,
      1999--Acclaim Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ: AKLM), a leading worldwide interactive
      entertainment company, today announced that they have signed a publishing deal with San
      Francisco-based game developer Click Entertainment. Under the agreement, Click will
      develop a samurai-inspired action role-playing game (RPG) for the PC to be published by
      Acclaim in Spring 2000. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Formed in 1997, Click
      Entertainment is staffed by industry veterans and is led by Doron Gartner and Ben Haas,
      both key members of the development team behind Blizzard Entertainment's critically
      acclaimed game Diablo. One of the best-selling games of 1997 and 1998, Diablo was widely
      recognized as the role-playing game of the year by the gaming industry. It won numerous
      accolades, including the &quot;Game of the Year&quot; award from Computer Gaming World and
      received an &quot;Editor's Choice&quot; award from PC Gamer. Other Click team members come
      from top developers like Activision, Psygnosis, and Radical Entertainment, as well as
      animation studios like Mainframe, which produces numerous animated television programs,
      including &quot;Reboot&quot; and &quot;BeastWars Transformers.&quot; </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">&quot;Working with Click advances
      our growing status as a leading PC games publisher,&quot; said Don Jackson, PC Product
      Manager, Acclaim Entertainment. &quot;The deal demonstrates our commitment to working with
      the top developers in the industry to create compelling new titles that PC gamers will
      love.&quot; </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Gartner said he was drawn to
      Acclaim because of their desire to create top-quality PC games, as well as Acclaim's
      experience in product testing, marketing and distribution. &quot;Acclaim is building a
      name for themselves in the PC gaming community and we're excited to be a part of their
      continued success.&quot; </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Click's first game with Acclaim
      will be an action-style RPG title inspired by samurai lore and movies like Akira
      Kurosawa's &quot;Throne of Blood&quot; and &quot;Sanjuro.&quot; Due in early 2000, the
      game will put players in the role of seven samurai warriors, each with his own special
      skill, tasked to defend their land from evil forces. </font></small></p>

    <blockquote>
      <i><p></i><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">A truly exhausting week is
      over and a new one is well under way. Many of you might have noticed that I did not do a
      lot of posting on the message boards lately and some of you might already know, why. I
      have been on press tour all of last week, presenting &quot;Torment&quot; to some 29
      writers all over the country. Some of them had seen the game before in another
      presentation we did last fall, but for many of them it was their first contact with the
      game. I took a development build of the game on the road to show everyone what the buzz is
      all about and - unless some of them have been blatantly lying to my face - I believe
      everyone loved what they saw. The response we got was very enthusiastic to say the least,
      and it shows us that we are indeed on the right track. A number of the folks we met with
      are writers for a number of online sources so expect new coverage on &quot;Torment&quot;
      to hit the web pretty soon. I guess we will set up a separate page with links to all the
      coverage we can find on the game so that it is much easier for you to surf all these
      exciting articles, each of which will most likely reveal some different angle and take on
      the game. Let's try to make this list as complete as possible together. So, if you are
      aware of any online sources that contain &quot;Torment&quot; related material, please send
      us the URL if it is missing from our list so that we can include it on our pages. Please
      send all URL submissions to webmaster@interplay.com and make sure you don't include
      questions in these emails as they will inevitably land on the desk of our webmasters who
      are most certainly too busy to answer your questions. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">In other news we are proud to
      announce that our print ad is finally finished and is going out to magazines these days.
      Remember I was telling you about the special effects photo shoot we did in Burbank some
      time ago? Here's the result of that one wonderful day and countless hours of
      post-production. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The ad is a result of a lot of
      tweaking and was subject to a number of ongoing discussions. Originally we had a
      completely different concept than the one you see above, but it got changed last December
      after some discussions with our senior managers and frankly, today I am very happy it did!
      </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Still, this design was also
      floating around for quite a while now and has undergone at least 10 changes. The
      arrangement of the images, the arrangement of the text, the text itself, the size of the
      head, the size and number of screenshots, everything was constantly juggled around, until
      we finally settled for the version you see here. What is even more important however is
      that finally you, too, can see the result of that photo session and the excruciating
      process of getting the ad right. It is a 2-page spread ad with a cool look, some
      information of the game and some really BIG screenshots. Picking the screenshots was a bit
      of a headache because we tried to find some screens that adequately represent the game's
      action as well as the overall feel. Variety is of course also something you want to show,
      not to mention some of the nice and unique features of the game. I believe the images we
      came up with serve that purpose quite well, although I am sure once the game is fully
      finished we would be able to come up with even more impressive screens than these. But
      hey, you have to draw a line somewhere, right? You want to see screens from the game now
      and not sometime in the summer, I assume, so here is our illustrious assembly of scenes
      from the game. Check out the shot with the Modrons and the cool lighting effect, and don't
      forget to take a look at the Pillar of Skulls, which by the way, is fully animated! I know
      it is almost sadistic to tease you with all these materials, but believe me, I wish I
      could play the game right now, just as much as any one of you. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Having said all this, I guess
      it's time to go back to work. If you have any question, opinions, comments or suggestions
      for the game, make sure to post it on our message boards and include everyone in your
      discussion. We love to hear from you and the feedback we get from these message boards is
      invaluable to us. So keep posting, and let us know what you think of the ad. </font></small></p>

    <small>Cliff Bleszinski of Epic Games had a bit to say why games like Deer Hunter and
    Barbie Fashion are good for the Industry. I must concur with him. Many people complain
    about these titles, but<font color="#FFFFFF"><strong> they are like books</strong></font>,
    if you don't want to read it don't buy it. Either way, they attract an audience who
    before, would have never considered buying a PC game product.&nbsp; Check it.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">***Why Deer Hunter and Barbie
      Fashion Designer are good for us*** </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">1. These people would not have
      purchased our games to begin with. Their interests lie in hunting or dolls, not aliens and
      swordplay. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">2. These games are &quot;gateway
      games&quot; to other genres, to &quot;real&quot; games. They reduce the &quot;intimidation
      factor&quot; that computers carry with them. Perhaps once the rednecks get tired of the
      hunting games they'll be interested in some real software. When the girls who are playing
      Barbie get older perhaps they'll graduate to big guns and Deathmatch. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">3. They're creating even more
      genres for the industry that help it to appeal to a wider consumer base. Notice how the
      music biz has product that appeals to everyone, music from Shania Twain to Ice T to
      Barenaked Ladies. Until recently we haven't seen a lot of games that have appealed to
      people outside of our little geek circle, and the market is being cracked wide open. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">4. Companies are making more

    <blockquote>
      <i><p></i><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Greetings friends! It has
      been far to long since I visited and posted here. Ultima IX: Ascension was driving hard to
      make a key schedule date which we just passed a day or two ago. I know that you have
      waited years for this game, and your patience is most admirable. The wait will be worth
      it. We just gave a demo to the whole company and got rave reviews. If you have any friends
      here at Origin, (say UO game masters), ask them to tell you about it. We should have a new
      round of screen shots coming soon that show off more cool environments, and many of the
      new features that are in, like more spells, more monsters, shadows, overbright lights,
      translucent fade-in clipping planes, and more. I for one am very exited and at last the
      team can see the results of their toiling and feel what final gameplay will be like. In
      any case. Its nice to visit and see how well horizons is flurishing. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">As you probably know... if you
      have any Ultima IX design feedback, please write me at: <a
      href="mailto:lordbritish@origin.ea.com">lordbritish@origin.ea.com</a> </font></small></p>

    </blockquote>
    <p><small>Then there is Amy Sage, who we haven't heard much from on her own page called
    Sage Advice dishing out some of her own Wisdom.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p></i><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">I'd like to take a moment
      to address a few emails I have recieved lately, inquiring about the release date of Ultima
      IX. You know I can't say anything about that... I'll leave that to the people in charge.
      Meanwhile, I'll just keep working on finishing it. :) </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">I also want to say that we are
      making really good progress. I was reading several posts from the U:A discussion board and
      the Horizons discussion board last night and got the impression that there are people who
      feel we're just sitting around, tossing the mostly-finished game around like a kickball
      before finally deciding to put it out. I have to admit, that made me laugh. :) Being
      someone who sits in the most populated room on the floor, I give you my most sincere
      assurance we are trying to get it to you as soon as possible. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The thing I enjoyed doing most
      today, as far as fun things in the game, was setting up an in-game cinematic. Coordinating
      the timing and sequences of camera cuts, speech, and character movements is quite a task,
      especially when you're trying to equal the intensity of an imagined scene from a
      Dragonlance novel. :) Another thing I enjoyed was setting up a shop with its stocks of
      potions and weapons. It's really fun to be creative with an area. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Since the graphics are so good,
      it's easy to think of U:A as real, because everything is so 3dimensional. Lately, after
      spending so much time in the game, I find I've started thinking about things in the game
      as real. This made it really entertaining a while back when I accidentally dropped a mace
      that had been set non-solid and it stopped, resting right through my Avatar's head. It was
      like some sort of unexpected, twisted arrow-through-the-head-trick. :) </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">*Oh, and if Richard's field mouse
      was Sherry, she's been hiding out in Richard's basement for a decade, because this one was
      only rescued a few months ago. Sorry, over there at the Blue Boar. :) </font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>Then we have CapnBill giving out the goods on blood and guts.</small></p>
    <i><blockquote>
      <p></i><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">It wouldnt be much fun
      wacking things if they didnt get damaged now would it? Combat in Ascension definitely
      includes blood and guts. Expect blood, and expect the amount of blood to be based on the
      amount of damage delivered. Anything beyond...well, we'll have to wait and see. :) </font></small><i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p></i><small>Here's a bit more from CapnBill on the X Y Axis deal.</small><i></p>
    </i><blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">This is quite a hot topic! Sorry
      to have created so much confusion &amp; consternation! Let me clarify some things: </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">First, one of our senior
      programmers has informed me that the pitch-reversal option is still in--so, perhaps it
      will remain. Considering how popular this option must be, we'll certainly give that a lot
      of consideration. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Second, the reason we would have
      removed it has to do with code maintenance. In any code base, old unused features tend to
      be &quot;pruned out&quot;, to make the code more clear &amp; maintainable. If we'd left
      every feature in that we'd ever tried as an experiment, the code would be horribly
      obfuscated. So, we tend to remove features that we feel have no future viability.
      (However, as I stated above, this feature turned out to still be in the code, even though
      no one on the team used it.)</font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Finally, a word about the
      rotation axis. I use &quot;x-axis rotation&quot; because pitch is defined in our
      coordinate system as rotation about the x axis. In our coordinate system, the x axis goes
      from left-to-right, with positive x coming out of your right ear. So, pitch (moving your
      camera view up or down) occurs about the x-axis. Yaw, which changes your compass heading
      (as though you're turning your head left or right) occurs about our z axis, which goes up
      and down in the world. And, roll (tilting your head) occurs about our y axis, which comes
      out your nose (pardon the anatomical analogies). </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Hope this clears things up!</font></small></p>
