      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" color="#C1C1FF"><strong> </strong></font><small><font
      color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Actualy, everything is player run. We don't have
      NPC guides that train you in skills, or that your required to visit in order to advance.
      That would be very against the way AC has been designed - with freedom of play shaping
      your character, not pre-defined templates..</font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left"><small>And here's a bit of mini Interview with Jason who pulls this guys
    pants down around his ankles and lets him have it.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Too make it more real? Oh please,
      if you believe that you were born yesterday. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">They are getting lazy, plain and
      simple. </font></small></p>
      <p><strong><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">First, let me apologize
      if I come of a bit harsh, but I get very tired of seeing this type of BS around here. </font></small></strong></p>
      <p><strong><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">As for being lazy, which
      you implied in your last post; listen bud, we've been working on this game for FIVE years,
      count them, FIVE. We started this company in a basement, worked our way through the living
      room and into our first office without getting paid. After almost three years of working
      on the game living off whatever we could scrape together, we finialy got a publisher who
      could back the product right. We haven't seen a cent from this game yet, and I doubt it
      will even recoup what we've put into it. It's a labor of love, and if you think we're
      being lazy then I think you need to go program one of these yourself and see how much work
      it actualy is. Pull out a calculator and figure out what it costs to employ 30-40 people
      for five years, even at minimal wage. </font></small></strong></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Actualy it is VERY important in
      RPGs for me. It help sets the mood. And since it is based around adventuring and killing
      it should have music to stir the blood. </font></small></p>
      <p><strong><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Music only sets the mood
      if it is in response to what is happening at that moment on the screen, and it's not that
      same track you've heard over, and over, and over, and over.. Besides, the sounds of the
      forest better convey the feeling of being IN a forest. </font></small></strong></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">And a game doesn't need to be
      delayed for music, since a whole other party would have to make it, it is just up to the
      designers to add some simple coding to add it. </font></small></p>
      <p><strong><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">If your going to add
      something to a game, don't do it because it makes a good bullet point on a checklist.
      Music is one of these bullet points. Sure, it would be great to have a score that
      recomposes itself on the fly to suit the mood of the scene, and remains interesting for
      the thousands (yes, thousands) of hours of play some people will put into a game like
      this. But not only is that incredibly hard to compose and design, but requires a really
      amazing sound system and quite a bit of system resources as well. Most games just stream
      several tracks off the CD - but how dynamic is that? How soon will you get sick of that
      music? The average game doesn't have the lifespan of an online RPG, and I'm always sick of
      the music before the game. </font></small></strong></p>
      <p><strong><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Ok, who out there would
      like us to delay the game for another year to design and impliment an interactive music
      system, which you'll want to turn off after a few days, raise your hand. Ok, who wants it
      this year? </font></small></strong></p>
      <p><strong><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Who would rather have
      things like house ownership, allegience wars, pets and riding animals instead? </font></small></strong></p>
      <p><strong><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">I think your out voted.. </font></small></strong></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">And since they are playing with
      MS money, GO FOR IT! </font></small></p>
      <p><strong><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">No - we're playing with
      our money. Go read a book on publisher relations in any industry, music, games, whatever.
      You'll quickly learn how ignorant that statement is. We don't just wire money out of Bill
      Gates personal bank account every time we need it - get real. </font></small></strong></p>
      <p><strong><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Bottom line, if you want
      music, there are a lot of musicians out there who would love to have you buy thier CDs. If
      you want custom music, fire up a midi or MP3 player in the background and watch it drain
      your system resources slowing your frame rate. </font></small></strong></p>

    <small>This weeks WoT development update has been kicked up by our boy Glen. Finally he
    has some interesting words to say <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>talking a bit about Star
    Wars</strong></font>. He also got around and posted a pic of the Development Team.
    (Luckily not while playing naked Twister)</small><font face="Arial" color="#C1C1FF"><strong>
    </strong></font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Every week that goes by is one
      week closer to either E3 or Star Wars; take your pick.&nbsp;&nbsp; Although you don't see
      people camping outside E3 a month in advance for tickets, you also won't see WoT at the
      theatre!&nbsp; So while you're at E3, I'll be nice enough to let you play a WoT Arena
      match if you give me your Star Wars tickets, guaranteed!</font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Speaking of which, we just played
      such a match tonight, and while the sound code decided to take a time-out, the game itself
      was more fun than ever.&nbsp; Chain Lightning is a lot more cool now.&nbsp; All you want
      to do is charge up, run into the middle of a bunch of pansies, and watch the sparks fly!
      &nbsp; It's very cool and much more balanced.&nbsp;&nbsp; We're also definitely getting
      better artifact loading than before, but there's still room for improvement.</font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The level designers have been
      getting ready for the review tomorrow (although they still have a fun night ahead of
      them).&nbsp; From what I've seen, they'll be wonderful.&nbsp;&nbsp; James' map is almost
      finished and the interactivity and architecture is spot on.&nbsp;&nbsp; Scott lost a bit
      of time to a cut scene environment, but his main map is still looking great.&nbsp; Warren
      is still dealing with his own convoluted Canadian tax issues--which is why I didn't get a
      chance to see his map today, so I'm crossing my fingers and hoping for the best.
      &nbsp; Tomorrow should be interesting.</font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">A lot of focus has been placed on
      AI lately to ensure not only effective enemies, but fun ones.&nbsp; I've been designing
      some different standard behavior patterns and Ryan has been coding some movement pattern
      tools which allow all of us to mess with how our characters walk/run/attack.&nbsp; Mike F.
      implemented a new sound slot system into which Sam is sticking our effects, while at the
      same time he tweaks all of the creature animation.</font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Cut scene finals are trickling
      in, which is making Jim very happy.&nbsp; He finally has assets to play with, testing and
      checking our compression tools to ensure quality, speed, and size are at the levels we
      need.&nbsp; The cut scenes themselves are pretty cool too.&nbsp;&nbsp; We'll have a bunch
      completely finished shortly (visuals, sound, and music all done) to show off at E3.</font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Paul and Julie are almost
      finished with the immediate UI tasks, and the final assets look great.&nbsp; Marc
      continues to support the level designers in their specific texture needs.&nbsp; Robert is
      still working through the decorations and effects.&nbsp; And Joel continues to pump out
      his excellent skins, which already have made a world of difference.&nbsp;&nbsp; As I've
      said numerous times before, we have some of the top artists in the business.&nbsp; I
      expect nothing but the best from each and every one of them, and they never fail me.</font></small></p>

    one's Online Magazine</a> (<font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Who thinks these names up?</strong></font>)
    recently about their upcoming Q2 conversion and RPG Engine they are creating called
    &quot;Renaissance&quot;. Here's a biscuit to bite on.</small></p>
    <i><blockquote>
      <p></i><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Renaissance is developing
      very quickly. We've been really quiet about it because we don't want to hype it yet since
      it's not fully functional. But we do have an excessively powerful interaction engine
      featuring an incredible scripting engine that will allow us to do literally anything we
      can imagine in terms of interaction. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The graphics engine is also
      shaping up, and already features volumetric lighting, seamless indoor/outdoor scenes, etc.
      We're working on a GUI and audio support now, as well as filling out the other critical
      features such as physics and collisions. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">By May, we'll have a technology
      demo to show at E3. We're setting up meetings with publishers already, and things look
      pretty positive.</font></small><i></p>

      <p></font><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">1) Will there be Pwipes -
      Most likely not, but we can't guarantee anything, which is why we tell everyone there
      could be. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">2) Informing the players about
      the Test Server status - We need to do a better job about this and we have a good plan to
      do just that. We're opening a Test Server section on our website. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">3) The sole purpose of the Test
      Server is to find bugs. But we do realize it's not easy to get people over there to help

    <small>Looks like the guys at <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Origin like to have their

    First up is Capn Bill on Color depth and Textures.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">I believe we'll support the
      24-bit or 32-bit resolutions, but still with 16-bit textures. In other words, I don't
      believe the fact that our textures are 16-bit limits your target frame buffer's
      depth....but I could be wrong. I've forwarded your question to our 3D expert--one of us'll
      get back to you soon with a definitive answer. </font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>How about some mini Quests?</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Yes, yes yes, there will be all
      kinds of mini quests in the game, some plot related, and some not. As we get closer to
      ship, we are trying to cram in as much as we can. I'm sorry I can't go into too much
      detail... </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">One is related to the Silver

      the Avatar to buy a house. He does have his own room in LB's Castle, and there are other
      people in the world who are more then happy to put him up for the night. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">As for buying a ship, the Avatar

    <small>Here's a <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>couple of Scooby snacks</strong></font> Rob
    Huebner left for all you Vampire fans out there. First one is on whether or not you can
    &quot;feed&quot; on innocents. Mmmm mmm good.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Well, without giving TOO much
      away, the answer is &quot;yes&quot; to pretty much all the topics you asked about. Our
      lead animator recently completed the first set of animations for feeding, and they look
      incredible. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">If we a chance to release an AVI,
      it would seem a logical choice. </font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>And a bit on Java.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Well, Java is very much like C++
      or even C, so really if you know anything about programming an object-oriented language,
      you won't have a problem with it. 90% of what you read about in a Java book isn't
      necessary to program the script, its just the underlying syntax that uses Java. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">If you go to
      &quot;java.sun.com&quot; and read the on-line docs to the point where you know how to
      write &quot;hello world&quot; and maybe an if/then/else statement or two, you're ready to
      go. </font></small></p>

    <small>Looks like Redline got the ball rolling and did a total overhaul to their Site with

    Like Adam said earlier, the info is really <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>starting to flow

    <small>Looks like WoT is going to be translated into various other languages so all you

      game, yes, it will be translated into other languages. I'm busy with getting everything

    <p></font></i><small>Also Glen stopped by and had this to say on new characters etc.</small><i><font

    </font></i><blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">You'll have to wait for the
      expanded character section of the web page--or potentially longer than that. Legion is
      discussed, but new creatures are going to be released over time. I think Legion may be on
      the tail end of that.</font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>And here's Sam Brown on Editing.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">There haven't been any final
      decisions made that I'm aware of, but this is a much more complicated situation than it
      seems. Because The Wheel of Time is not owned by us (we had to pay to use the license)
      it's a distinct possibility that no one else will be able to utilize those items specific
      to WoT. I'm not saying this is how it is, I'm just letting you know that this is a very
      sticky situation and I hope everyone understands that this really isn't open to
      negotiation...it's all part of the unfortunate business end of making a game based on a
      popular license.</font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>And a bit about Online Interface.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The online interface hasn't been
      solidified yet, but expect something along the lines of a GameSpy interface that will show
      active servers and you simply click the server you want to join and go there.</font></small></p>
