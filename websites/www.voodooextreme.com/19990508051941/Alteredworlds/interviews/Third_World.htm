    By: Madbard<br>
    With: Adam Maxwell</small></em></p>
    <p align="left"><small>In an Industry filled with Diablo clones, and Baldur's Gate
    wannabe's, it's always good to get a breathe of fresh air. Third World looks to be the
    game to give us just that. Without further ado, sit back, relax, and let Madbard take you
    on an Altered journey into Third World!</small></p>
    <hr>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#8080FF">MB:</font><font face="Arial" size="2"
    color="#8080C0"> First off tell us a little about your personal background in the computer
    gaming industry. Also talk a little on the Third World design team. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#8080FF">Adam: </font><font face="Arial" size="2"
    color="#8080C0">Well, it&#146;s a pretty standard story really, I got my start in the
    industry as an unpaid beta tester. By the time I had graduated from high school I had
    tested games for most of the major game publishers of the time. From there I managed to
    get a job as a technical support representative for Blizzard, where I met Ron Millar,
    Chris Metzen, and the rest of Blizzard&#146;s amazingly talented team. I worked at
    Blizzard doing various things for almost 3 years. During that last year Ron Millar left to
    found Redline Games with James Anhalt. Ron offered me my big &quot;break&quot; as a an
    assistant designer shortly after that, and I left Blizzard to come work with Redline on
    Third World.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#8080C0">Coming to work for Redline was an amazing
    experience. The other companies I had dealt with were all established, large companies
    that had set procedures and hierarchies. Here at Redline I was introduced to a newly
    assembled team with no set rules, no set hierarchies, and no history. What Redline has is
    a team of passionate talented people dedicated to making the best possible games we can.
    We&#146;re writing our own rules and history as we go along. Add the fact that we&#146;re
    a small, very tightly knit, team to that sense of adventure and you&#146;ve got one
    helluva cool place to work.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#8080C0">The team here is definitely the best
    combination of talent and personality I&#146;ve seen in a long time. We all get along
    damned well, and our talents and skills compliment each other greatly. James Anhalt is the
    president of Redline, and the lead programmer for Third World. He&#146;s a quiet guy, but
    he always knows what&#146;s going on and how to fix a problem. A lot of the time
    he&#146;ll come up with a simple answer to stuff I had considered a &quot;design
    dilemma&quot;. Derek Frost is our lead 2D artist and Creative Director. That means
    he&#146;s responsible for making sure the game and the game universe work together and
    that the overall feel of the game fits the mood we&#146;re shooting for. Derek and I work
    pretty closely together on the design of the game, and we came up with the story together.
    I&#146;m the designer on the game right now, my responsibility is to the playability of
    the game. My job is to make sure this game is fun to play and easy to grasp. Carl Chimes
    is the senior programmer working on Third World. He comes to us from working on Dark
    Reign. He&#146;s a technical genius and is responsible for a lot of the technology and
    &quot;eye candy&quot; behind the game engine. In fact James and Carl are the guys that
    have built the Third World engine into the powerhouse it is now. Martin Jajam is
    programming the map editor and the scripts for the game. He came in and created a fully
    functional 3D environment editor in a matter of months. Then he dove right into the game
    engine and brought the objects of the world to life. The last programmer on the team is
    Joseph Lee. Joe is programming the AI for the NPCs of the world. Thanks to him the workers
    in the city are actually working, the prostitutes are&#133; prostituting, and the enemy
    squads are working against you to stop you. Steve Pabst is our sound designer and one of
    the composers responsible for Warp Digital, the company that we&#146;ve contracted to do
    the sound track for Third World. I consider working with Steve a true privilege. Only once
    before have I seen someone so dedicated to music and sound. His sounds, and the Third
    World sound track are instrumental (pardon the pun) to bringing Third World to life.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#8080C0">Of course, unless you can see the world it
    doesn&#146;t matter, and that&#146;s where our art team comes in. Paul Lee and Chris
    &quot;Guzzy&quot; Guzman are our 3D artists. Thanks to their efforts the characters in
    this game actually have character, and the special effects are something to be proud of.
    They work closely with Derek and Tony Carrillo, both of whom fill the role of 2D artists
    admirably. Derek and Tony did the textures for the map, the items, and just about
    everything else in the game. They also did all of the concept artwork that helped us all
    visualize Third World the same way. Without our 4 artists, I shudder to think of what
    Third World would look like.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#8080C0">The newest member of the team is Justin
    Pacuska, our level designer. Justin and I built all of the locations in the game using the
    editor that Martin programmed. Let me tell you that without Justin&#146;s help, I&#146;d
    still be building. I&#146;ve never seen anyone build worlds as quickly, or as
    realistically as Justin does. His first task here was to build a mining complex that
    figures into the story. He was done in 3 days, and the quality, especially considering
    that it was his first serious work in 3D, was amazing. Justin was a welcome addition to
    the team.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#8080FF">MB:</font><font face="Arial" size="2"
    color="#8080C0"> Now unlike most CRPGs Third World is set in the Sci-fi future which will
    be a welcome change for many gamers. Altered World's own Sacrates and millions of other
    Star Wars, Shadowrun and Blade Runner refugees are going to be popping out of the wood
    work for this game. Give us a little background on the story behind Third World and its
    Cyber-punk environment. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#8080FF">Adam: </font><font face="Arial" size="2"
    color="#8080C0">Third World takes places on another planet. Third world is, itself, a
    botched corporate colonization effort. Years after colonization the world is in a state of
    barely veiled chaos and perpetual decay. The corporations control the people and fight an
    eternal cold war amongst themselves. The streets are filled with gangs and hired guns, all
    looking for ways to make a quick buck and move up in the world. That&#146;s where the
    player comes in. The player is the leader of a mercenary squad taking various covert and
    &quot;Wet&quot; missions from the corporations, building a bankroll for retirement and a
    chance to live life as one of Third World&#146;s elite, or perhaps as a Warlord with a
    small empire all their own. How it turns out for each squad is up to them and is
    determined by their skills as warriors, diplomats, and gamblers.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#8080FF">MB:</font><font face="Arial" size="2"
    color="#8080C0"> Now making a CRPG always opens developers to criticism. It seems that RPG
    fans are always the hardest to please when it comes to game detail and what a player can
    or can't do in the game. How much freedom will there be in Third World? And how much of
    the game world can the characters affect? </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#8080FF">Adam:</font><font face="Arial" size="2"
    color="#8080C0"> That&#146;s definitely something we&#146;re aware of. We&#146;re all CRPG
    fans here, and we have our list of pet peeves that we&#146;re trying to address. One of
    the major problems, as you mentioned, is how much the player can really influence the
    world they play in. When you make an RPG you have to decide what you&#146;re primary goal
    is going to be. Is it going to be story, or is going to be player freedom. For the most
    part, the two are exclusive. That doesn&#146;t mean you can&#146;t make a game with a
    great story and a lot of freedom for the player, but often to get one you have to
    sacrifice the other. We didn&#146;t want to make that sacrifice at all so we had to find a
    different solution. The Single player game is a very definite story. The player has a lot
    of influence at each individual location, but the story directs a lot of the player&#146;s
    movements (not controls the player, but directs what goals should be accomplished, etc.).
    We wanted more freedom then that in the game as well, which is why the multiplayer aspect
    is more of a true RPG. In the multiplayer system, the player&#146;s goals and motivations
    are up the player. If the player wants to be a merciless killer, so be it. If the player
    wants to fight for the side of right and justice, so be it. The player should be able to
    do pretty much anything they want to do. Of course there are consequences for every
    action, both in single and multiplayer. Break the law and the law will come looking for
    you, cross someone the wrong the way, and what happens depends on how fast you think and
    how badly you crossed the other person or NPC.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#8080C0">In both single player and multiplayer we
    wanted to give the player as much freedom as we possibly could. Our motto here is,
    &quot;if the player thinks they can do it, they can.&quot; There is a lot of interactivity
    in the world that has nothing to do with anything, it&#146;s there because it makes sense
    to be there. Break into a chemical refinery and you&#146;ll be able to raid their labs,
    search their storage areas, and talk to their employees. It has nothing to do with your
    mission or goal there, but you can do it. That&#146;s true of every location in the game.
    We hope that when the players get a chance to build their own locations with the included
    editor that they follow the same guidelines. After all, our goal here was to build a
    world, not just a collection of levels.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#8080FF">MB: </font><font face="Arial" size="2"
    color="#8080C0">The foundation of any RPG or CRPG is character development. How does the
    character creation system and the character advancement system work in Third World? And
    what are the classes and races players can choose from?</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#8080FF">Adam:</font><font face="Arial" size="2"
    color="#8080C0"> The character creation system was designed with customized characters in
    mind. There are restrictions on which races can be which character classes, but
    that&#146;s about it. When you create a character you choose it&#146;s race, it&#146;s
    class, and customize the character&#146;s features to suit your image of the character.
    That doesn&#146;t seem like a lot of freedom at first, but allow me to explain how
    character advancement works. Once you&#146;ve created a basic character, it&#146;s up to
    you to decide how that character progresses. Advancement isn&#146;t an arbitrary level
    based thing. Instead the advancement is based on how much and how well you use, the 5
    stats and 5 skills available to each character. If you choose to play a human commando,
    for example, but use that commando primarily as a hacker, you&#146;ll end up with a
    commando that can&#146;t really fight, but can hack a mainframe without breaking a sweat.
    Your characters also age as the game progresses, and every year they age changes the
    character, in some cases for the better, but as with any of us, as we get older we get a
    little slower, perhaps a little weaker. Each race ages differently though, if you&#146;re
    in it for the long haul, how a race ages will influence your choices. Wardroids, for
    example, are artificially intelligent military droids. They don&#146;t exactly age, but
    the law has placed strict regulations on them. They have a 45 year lifespan. After 45
    years they have to turn themselves in for mandatory recycling, if they don&#146;t
    they&#146;re considered rogue, and the laws that protect sentient beings on Third World
    don&#146;t apply to them.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#8080C0">As for the character classes and races in
    Third World&#133; There are 5 race, Humans, Greks, Dendrites, Ferox, and Wardroids. Humans
    we all know, so I won&#146;t go into too much detail there. The Greks are a deeply
    spiritual race that have a reverence for nature and an understanding of the world is
    unparalleled. Their faith and ties to the land make them powerful hunters and shamans.
    Their strength and speed make them some of the best hand to hand fighters on the planet.
    The Ferox are a race of brutish, savage, thugs. They aren&#146;t too bright, but they are
    strong, fierce, and quick to brawl. This makes the few Ferox on Third World highly sought
    after by corporate security and street gangs everywhere. The Dendrites are about as
    opposite from the Ferox as you can get. Dendrite are small, frail, and possess massive
    intellects and psionic abilities. They&#146;re known for finding a solution to any
    problem, and make excellent researchers. Finally we come to the Wardroids. Wardroids were
    created in Third World&#146;s largest war, the Ferox-Human war. When humanity first met
    the Ferox, the Ferox were not interested in coexisting peacefully. In fact they pounded
    the snot out of the human defense forces for years. Humanity was running out of soldiers
    and they needed to find a solution quickly. A pretty small robotics firm at the time came
    up with the idea of using robotic soldiers, the Wardroids. The results of the first few
    wardroid companies in the war were so positive that they&#146;ve become a household word
    in security. In fact the planetary law enforcement agency is controlled by a central AI
    that orders modified Wardroids called Enforcers to patrol and keep the peace. The awesome
    power of the Wardroid, and the abuses they were used for after the Ferox-Human war, are
    the primary reasons for the strict controls on Wardroid lifespans. Street gangs and
    dissidents were salvaging old wardroids from the wreckage of the Ferox-Human wars, and
    using them as unstoppable armies to gain territory and power. The corporations found
    this&#133; Distasteful and moved to regulate damned near every aspect of Wardroid usage.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#8080FF">MB: </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#8080C0">How does
    economics come into play in Third World? Do characters have and spend money? </font></p>
    <p><font color="#8080FF">Adam: </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#8080C0">Absolutely.
    Money is what makes any world go around, Third World is no different. The currency is
    different, sure, but the accumulation of wealth, and its applications towards gaining
    power are what it&#146;s all about. After all, nothing is worth killing or dying for like
    cold hard credits if you&#146;re the captain of a cold-hearted, well armed mercenary squad
    looking to live the good life.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#8080FF">MB:</font><font color="#8080C0"> </font><font face="Arial"
    size="2" color="#8080C0">The modifications you can make to a character in Third World may
    not be for the faint of heart. Of course it's common knowledge that mutagenics and
    cybernetic technology is what puts the Altered in Altered Worlds. Tell us how characters
    can &quot;improve&quot; themselves with modifications in Third World. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#8080FF">Adam: </font><font face="Arial" size="2"
    color="#8080C0">The mods in third world run the standard c-punk gauntlet, but there are a
    few&#133; surprises. I don&#146;t want to give anything away, but lets just say that
    genetic research is a good thing.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#8080FF">MB:</font><font face="Arial" size="2"
    color="#8080C0"> There are psionics in Third World. Are these mind powers used the way
    spells are in fantasy based CRPGs? And what types of things can a character do with
    psionics? </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#8080FF">Adam: </font><font face="Arial" size="2"
    color="#8080C0">Psionics in third world are used differently by the races that possess
    them. The Dendrites, for example, channel their psionic power into the manipulation of
    perception. They can make you see things that aren&#146;t there, slow down you perception
    of time, etc. In general I would have to say that psionics and their use are similar to
    spells in fantasy CRPGs, but a large effort has been put into making every possible effect
    unique, and viable given the universe the game is set in. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#8080FF">MB:</font><font face="Arial" size="2"
    color="#8080C0"> There seems to be a lot of different environments in the game. Could you
    give us a few examples? </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#8080FF">Adam: </font><font face="Arial" size="2"
    color="#8080C0">Sure, in the single player story you&#146;ll encounter a lot of the
    different terrain on Third world. In the first half of the story alone you&#146;ll see
    barren wastelands, subterranean caverns, the city streets, and more. I don&#146;t want to
    give all of the different locations away, since some of them pretty amazing, but
    you&#146;ll travel all over the planet during the game, so if it&#146;s on Third World,
    you&#146;ll probably see it. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#8080FF">MB: </font><font face="Arial" size="2"
    color="#8080C0">Many gamers complain about combat in CRPGs. How will combat take place in
    Third World? And how do tactics come into play with real-time combat? </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#8080FF">Adam: </font><font face="Arial" size="2"
    color="#8080C0">Tactics and real-time combat go hand in hand to me. In a real-time
    environment, you&#146;re pretty much forced to think tactically as opposed to
    strategically. However, there are very few games out there that really handle squad-based
    tactics well. Unfortunately none of the shining examples of squad based combat are
    role-playing games, and up until recently, none of them were real-time either. Our first
    goal with Third World is to create a world, and gaming system that promoted the use of
    squad based tactics. How you deploy, and employ, every single member of your squad
    matters, but because it&#146;s real-time, your success is also dependant on your sense of
    timing. The feeling you get when you successfully pull of an ambush in real-time is
    totally different from the feeling you get in a turn-based game. Granted there isn&#146;t
    as much time to plot and plan, but that&#146;s one of the conditions you have to overcome
    or work around in real-time, just as visibility, positioning, timing, and equipment
    choices are. We&#146;ve made every effort to factor in as many conditions and variables
    into the combat system as possible, while at the same time keep it fun to play and easy to
    control.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#8080C0">There are over 60 different weapons in the
    game, as well as over 45 items. In many cases those items and weapons work together. The
    benefit of all of this is that all of these factors change the tactics you use. A lot of
    times combat in CRPGs is severely restricted or simplified. Since combat is one of the
    strong focuses in the game we wanted to make sure the players had as much freedom as
    possible. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#8080FF">MB: </font><font face="Arial" size="2"
    color="#8080C0">Third World seems to be tailored made for multiplayer. What types of
    multiplayer games will be available in Third World? And what types of connections can we
    use to link up with our buddies? Also what's this I hear of players being able to set up
    their own servers and customize their own worlds? The Devil you say!!! </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#8080FF">Adam: </font><font face="Arial" size="2"
    color="#8080C0">We feel that Third World&#146;s multiplayer options are really what makes
    the game shine. If you log-on to sec-net through the internet, you&#146;ll be presented
    with all of the missions currently running on the internet, and be able to talk to the
    other people playing the game. That&#146;s all pretty familiar, but on-top of that are the
    items that help build the sense of an on-going world and a community. If you play a squad
    that has no respect for the law, or one that breaks contracts with corporations,
    you&#146;ll be faced with bounties on your heads. The game is more then just combat and
    missions, although that plays a key role in the game. The game is also dealing with the
    other people on-line experiencing this world. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#8080C0">A great example of that is the mission
    system itself. When you accept a mission from a corporation and enter the world, there are
    events going on around you that you have nothing to do with. For example, you&#146;re
    mission may be to destroy a Tubeway car as it pulls into a station, to send a message to
    the corporation running the train. At the same time another gang may have the mission of
    picking up a corporate executive and escorting him to a safehouse elsewhere in the city.
    While your two missions are unrelated, they take place on the same map at the same time.
    The other player is either going to have to delay you long enough to get their executive,
    or stop you from destroying the train. It promotes a secondary interaction with other
    players that a lot of the internet games out there lack.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#8080C0">The missions themselves are all different.
    You may be on an escort mission one day, only to be fighting an arena battle for cash
    prizes another. Another thing to note is that most missions have a counter-mission as
    well. Your mission may be to raid a lab and steal a sample of some new technology, as soon
    as you accept that mission, a mission for garrison duty at the same lab may be issued (or
    vice versa) for anyone on Sec-Net to take. Suddenly you&#146;re not playing against the
    computer or the lab&#146;s standard security forces, instead you are playing against the

    will kill me if I don't get into some eye-candy specifics. You will be using a true 3D
    engine. Did Redline develop this engine? And what perspectives can we expect in Third
    World? </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#8080FF">Adam: </font><font face="Arial" size="2"
    color="#8080C0">The Third World engine was built from scratch with the idea of tactical
    squad based combat in mind. As the game progresses the engine is continually refined to
    take advantage of new hardware and new refinements in special FX and interface. The game
    itself uses a ¾ perspective, but you have control of the panning, zooming, and tilt of
    the camera, for the most part. The game uses an intelligent camera positioning system to
    keep the camera unobstructed, and to keep the things in view that you want to see. Of
    course, we don&#146;t lock you into anything, if you want to take a look around, you have
    that level of control. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#8080FF">MB:</font><font color="#8080C0"> </font><font face="Arial"
    size="2" color="#8080C0">What type of accelerated support will be offered with Third
    World? </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#8080FF">Adam:</font><font face="Arial" size="2"
    color="#8080C0"> The engine is built to take advantage of most 3D accelerated video cards
    via D3D, while the editor uses OpenGL for it&#146;s hardware acceleration. The engine will
    also take advantage of Creative&#146;s EAX if you have drivers that support it.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#8080FF">MB: </font><font face="Arial" size="2"
    color="#8080C0">Now the requirements for Third World are listed at 133Mhz with 16mb of
    ram. That seems kind of low now days. Do you expect this to change in the future? </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#8080FF">Adam: </font><font face="Arial" size="2"
    color="#8080C0">Umm, I&#146;d definitely have to say that the requirements will most like
    raise before the game ships. Every layer of complexity we add the game takes its toll in
    processor and memory usage, unfortunately. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#8080FF">MB:</font><font face="Arial" size="2"
    color="#8080C0"> How much of Third World is completed right now? </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#8080FF">Adam: </font><font face="Arial" size="2"
    color="#8080C0">A large portion of the production work is finished at this point.
    We&#146;re mainly tweaking, tuning, and cramming in a lot of the features we feared we
    weren&#146;t going to get into the game.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#8080FF">MB:</font><font face="Arial" size="2"
    color="#8080C0"> Is there anything else you want our readers to know about Third World?</font></p>
    <p><font color="#8080FF">Adam: </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#8080C0">There&#146;s
    a lot I&#146;d love to spill, especially about how all of the various game system interact
    with each other and influence the game&#146;s universe, but I think it would be better if
    they were discovered by each player as they experience this game. After all, uncovering
    secrets and discovering intricacies are part of the game playing experience. :)</font></td>
