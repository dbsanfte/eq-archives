      The texture artists have come a long way from the beginning.&nbsp; They now understand not
      only the importance of lovely art, but the technical requirements to make it shine in
      every situation.&nbsp; Technical achievements across the board have facilitated better
      effects and well-architectured AI. &nbsp; Showing all of this to an audience whose last

      and up players have been around that long.</font></small></p>
      <p><strong><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">This is true. The highest
      level tester in the game (who naturally achieved that level) is level 35, and this person
      was in VERY early in the beta, and plays almost all day long. 6 or so months to level 35
      is about right and all according to plan.</font></small></strong></p>
      <p><strong><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">And to clarify, there
      have indeed been player wipes at the end of each phase, yet we have allowed each player to
      keep the level (not equipment) of one character (because we need higher level characters
      to test higher level areas). Also, some testers and people in the press have been
      artificially 'buffed' up.</font></small></strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Part of the problem
      in deciding whether CRPG's are currently in good shape or bad is that people define the
      term RPG differently. So what is an RPG? Is it a game in which you create a party of
      adventurers, use them to freely interact with that world, meet and converse with secondary
      characters (NPC's), fight monsters, collect treasure and gain &quot;levels?&quot; What if
      you take away the party and make the player manipulate a single character? Does it cease
      to be an RPG? Some purists have screamed loudly about this for years, bashing games that
      do away with the concept of the &quot;party of followers.&quot; What if there is a party,
      but the player does not get to create the characters&#133;their identities are
      pre-scripted? Does it cease to be an RPG then, even if it has all of the other elements?
      Again, some have said that a game without these elements is not an RPG. These definitions
      are restrictive, which is bad from a creativity standpoint, and if all game developers did
      stick to them then the genre would never grow; most RPG's would feel the same.</font></small></p>

      <i><p></i><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Audball is busy, so I'm
      posting for him. I asked this question of Audball, and he has supplied me with this:<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Currently, there is only one &quot;layer&quot; per &quot;body part&quot; that can be
      equipped. For instance, the Avatar's &quot;torso, waist and neck&quot; can either be
      &quot;naked&quot;, &quot;equiped with the platemail chestplate&quot;, &quot;equipped with
      the ringmail chestpiece&quot;, etc.<br>
      <br>
      As for capes, we could have the artists work up an &quot;equipment piece&quot; that
      contains a cape - for example, simply change the &quot;leather armor torso&quot; model to
      have a cape integrated into that same piece. Granted, it would look somewhat silly that
      the cape &quot;comes with&quot; the chestpiece, but the layer limit is what makes that so.<br>
      <br>
      As for battle damage: what it requires is either: dynamic textures, texture overlays,
      texture combining, or multiple body/armor/equipped models/pieces - all of which are very
      costly at this stage in development, and so may not appear in the final game.&quot;</font></small></p>

    Looks like <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>everyone has got Wood for this game</strong></font>.
    Here's a clip.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The game's atmosphere rocks
      majorly. I like the way it plays, the puzzles are kinda neat, and I actually kinda get
      scared/jumpy while playing it. Very cool. </font></small></p>

    <small>I thought the demo for this game was the shit. It looks like everyone thinks the
    full game is the same way. I have always loved the Roberta Williams titles, she is like
    Miyamato and Garriot in many respects in that<font color="#FFFFFF"><strong> she
    understands design philosophy</strong></font> and what makes a good game. With that said,
    this title is solid High Fantasy that you should defenitely check into. Check out this <a href="http://www.gameasylum.com/articles/kqmoe.shtml">Review</a> posted by Game Asylum for
    your reading pleasure.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Watching the opening
      sequence in King&#146;s Quest VIII (Mask of Eternity) gave me a good idea of just how high
      this game was gonna fly. I was prepared for a mild-mannered flight when I slipped the disk
      home&#133;but I was in for much more than I&#146;d bargained for. To say the least&#133;I
      was happily blown away with the immersive detail that immediately drew me into a vast 3D
      universe that was both fast-paced and beautiful. </font></small></p>

    <small>Well gang there was only so long the AW crew could live off sawdust and human
    sacrifice victoms. (Sidenote: Human Sacrifice Victoms taste great with Blueberry Jelly)
    With that said, we end the Everquest Fast today. Brad (<font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Spawn
    of Satan</strong></font>) never sent us one thing, not even love letters. Oh well, Beta 4
    starts in the next couple of weeks. I suspect it will start around late December, unless
    of course they have already duplicated a bunch of Beta CD's for shipping? Then I would say
    mid December possibly. <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Really depends on how bad the Beta 3
    guys screw it up</strong></font>. Hopefully you'll see us wondering the lands of Norath
    soon enough in our elusive search for those naked, big breasted Elven women at play in a
    waterfall.</small><br>
