    <small>Yup, it's that time of the week kids. Glen slapped up this weeks dose of WoTTy
    goodness. WoT fans have got to be<font color="#FFFFFF"><strong> in a state of bliss right
    now </strong></font>with the new novel and game in progress. Here ya go.</small></p>
    <font color="#004080"><blockquote>
      <p></font><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Making games is fun. So is
      poking out your eyes with a hot spike. You just have to be in the right mood... </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">I'm afraid the official WoT bag
      of treats is empty this Halloween. All you get is a tasty tidbit of text, and as weary as
      I am, I wouldn't be surprised if it really tasted like sandpaper. I'm just tired and
      irritable because I got little sleep this weekend, feverishly writing the scripts for the
      cutscenes. Given that they have to be done ASAP, as we need to lay down the voices for the
      animation, I'm spending every free moment on them. I like them, though. If we really can
      pull off what I've scripted, we'll be including a freakin' movie with your game! The
      recent release of The Path of Daggers (Jordan's latest addition to the Wheel of Time
      series of books) has helped put me in that 'WoT' dialog frame of mind. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Kathleen Bober, a long-time
      friend of Legend, artist, and resident voice-and-video talent coordinator, has arrived to
      help me out. It's been a while since I've worked with her (voice recording on Death Gate
      was the last go-around), but it's always a pleasure and I'm glad for the opportunity. And,
      again, we're extremely close to nailing down the animation studio responsible for bringing
      it all together. Watch this space. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">We're steaming ahead for the
      milestone on the tenth. It includes a wonderful multi-player map, consisting of the world
      map that I've been showing off the past two weeks, and three citadel variants that rock.
      In addition, the level designers are producing new maps like crazy. Our first
      single-player map from James is at alpha, and more are well on their way. I've seen some
      wonderful single-player work from our mystery mapper, whom I'll now introduce to you: Tim
      Jervis. He comes to us fresh from a stint on Heretic 2 and his style is meshing very well
      with what we've already achieved. Scott finished optimizing and enhancing the Whitecloak
      primitives. You thought they were beautiful before; now, they're absolutely awesome.
      Warren is producing a couple of variants that look fantastic. Soon, he's moving onto a
      Portal Stone world. Cool. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">New software architecture is
      being implemented throughout the entire game. Jim has moved from pathing to traps, Aaron
      is getting the artifacts in place, and the Ryan and Mike show are hard at work on the
      upcoming milestone requirements (player models, animations, and grunt AI). It's pretty
      cool seeing the grunts running around, suddenly smart about their surroundings and each
      other; before they tended to exhibit a behavior we affectionately termed 'Cluster Fun'
      (only it wasn't quite 'fun'). </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The texture artists have finally
      left Shadar Logoth in favor of the Aes Sedai primitives. In the meantime, they've produced
      some incredible world/skybox textures, and Paul rediscovered some older textures he
      painted ages ago (remember that door I showed you?). The level designers, most of whom
      joined the team long after those textures were created, ripped into them like starving
      dogs. Evidently, they're very happy with the discovery (not that they didn't have over
      1,100 textures to work with before this). Paul has also started generating the
      long-anticipated architectural sketches and reference material for the White Tower. It
      shouldn't be long until we actually see finished primitives and variants using them. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Is your tongue dry yet? Ah, I
      long for the days of old where I stayed up until the wee hours writing counter contest
      columns and viewer mail. I hope you don't mind if I keep the creative writing assignments
      focused on the game. I think, in the long run, you'll like it better that way. Now I'm off
      to figure out how to get every female character to cross her arms under her breasts. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Until next time! </font></small></p>

      utilized. Intelligent design of play areas is important as well.<br>

      being a good mix: </font><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">But trust the
      press release... </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The issues: </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">1) A couple of major titles have
      slipped. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">2) Big returns and mark-downs
      from products that did not perform well in the market. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The facts: </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">1) Sales are up 50% versus same
      quarter last year </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">2) Big development/investment
      dollars have gone out the door and have not yet yielded returns. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">I leave it up to you to do your
      own analysis of whether the money that has been spent on Baldur's Gate, or Messiah, or
      Giants, or Earthworm Jim 3D, etc, etc, will yield appropriate returns. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The press report basically said
      that even a company the size of Interplay has only so much cash to invest. It also stated
      that Brian Fargo is willing to put up $5 million of his own cash in order to secure a line
      of credit to get Interplay through this 'lean' period. (A personal vote of confidence in
      Interplay). </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">So when I say it has not impacted
      Baldur's Gate, I mean that Baldur's Gate is one of the products that will be critical to
      successfully launch in order for us to get a nice healthy return on all of the dollars
      that have been invested in it to date (several years of development, marketing, etc, etc).
      In my PERSONAL opinion, it does not make sense to pull support right before a product is
      getting ready to be launched. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Baldur's Gate is getting more
      than its fair share of attention and support - if you ask Bioware, it is probably getting

    RPG</a> found that Game Power posted a<a href="http://www.gamepower.com/games/html/5970main.html"> Review of Rage of Mages</a>.
    This game has got me more confused than <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>a beardless Dwarf in
    a crowd of naked big breasted Nymphs</strong></font>! I am not exactly sure what it is
    trying to be but I don't think the results came out just right.</small></p>

    <small><a href="http://www.agn3d.com/">AGN 3D</a> just posted news that the Warzone kicked
    up an Interview with the guys working on Dues Ex. Other than that not much happening in
    the lands of online RPG news just yet. <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Sit back, put in some
    Tito Jackson</strong></font> and read this <a href="http://www.warzone.com/features/deusex2/">Interview</a> until the news kicks in.</small><font face="Arial" color="#C1C1FF"><strong> </strong></font></p>

      <p><font size="2"><font face="Bookman Old Style"><font color="#8080FF">WarZone:</font><font color="#8080C0"> Okay, that all sounds good, but what about the player character? How
      customizable will the player character be (looks, traits, etc.)?</font></font></p>
      <p></font><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="2" color="#8080FF">Steve: </font><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style" size="2">Very. There is a lot of variation in the
      skills you choose, the augmentations you acquire and the inventory you carry around. Since
      you are not a pack mule and you cannot carry everything at once, you have to make some
      critical decisions about what to pick up. Plus conversations reflect your attitude. By the
      end of the game, the character will be highly customized by the player&#146;s choice.</font><font size="2"></p>
      <p></font><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="2" color="#8080FF">Witchboy: </font><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style" size="2">We want to give the player as much
      freedom as possible. Our systems depend on the player making choices and living with the
      outcome. Also, we have multiple versions of the player-character for different suits and
      environments. We&#146;re toying with how to effectively do multiple races and both
      genders. No promises, but we&#146;re very much into the concept of user creativty and
      differentiation of experience.</font></p>

    <small>Looks like alls quite on the Baldur's Gate front lately? There could be a few
    reasons for this: Either they are in the middle of day and night programming, bug hunting,
    coke drinking, Baldur's Gate fixing binge, or they are watching reruns of Gilligan's
    Island and thinking of possible ways to incorporate the entire cast into their game.
    Personally I would have to go with The Skipper. The man could probably <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>rip a fart that could kill a whole room full of Ogre's.</strong></font>
    Anyway, Scott Grieg was back on the boards and had this to say on screenshots.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Right now if you
      press ctrl-P, it dumps a screen shot to the screenshots directory. We will probably leave
      this in, because everyone will want to capture that &quot;kodak moment&quot; when you wack
      that pesky elf guy. :)</font></small></p>

    <p align="left"><small>Don was there too on this little programming question.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The game is written
      in C++ with some very small portions written in assembly. As an example the routine that
      takes out raw sprite data and renders it to the screen is written in assemby.</font></small></p>
