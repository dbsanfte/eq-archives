    <small>Looks like the guys over at Bioware are in the homestretch. <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>You
    can almost sense the impending release now</strong></font>. A lot of discussion going on
    about Preordering etc. Here is Greg covering all the bases tonight with a few tasty
    blurbs. First he touches on the replayability of the game.</p>
    </small><blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Though I have never
      played through the game all the way to the end, I have started three different parties and
      played for a while with each. My first character was a Chaotic Good Fighter, second was a
      Lawful Good (obviously) Paladin, third was a Neutral Good Mage. </font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">All three times I have had
      different experiences. (The Paladin was strongest right out the gates... the Mage might be
      strongest long-term) </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Oh, and I haven't even BEGUN to
      mess with races yet... my Fighter was a half-elf, and that was about it...</font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>A bit more on Preorders.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">With the exception that I have
      received 249 emails in the last 4 hours, I am happy to be here... it will just take me a
      while to get through all the feedback. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The other thing - we are going to
      take care of people, so I am not worried about some of these short-term issues. The
      important thing is to focus on the longer term and make sure that we get the best possible
      pre-order system up and running. I want to hear about ALL problems so we can fix them.
      Once we fix them, I expect to receive TWICE as many emails from fans saying 'thank you -
      you guys exceeded my expectations!' </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">(Ok... don't rain on my
      fantasies...)</font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>Luke also jumps in and talks about Ressurection penalties in the game.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">We read and post often. Best way
      to contact us? Exactly how you did. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Now for the part you don't want
      to hear :) </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The decision to allow for
      resurrection with no penalty was made some time ago, and will not be changed at this
      point. Whether it was in at some point or not is irrelevant, and the &quot;ease&quot; of
      implementation is also not a factor at this point. Anything changed effects something else
      somewhere, and we cannot risk altering a feature we do not have time to re-test. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">As for why it was done in the
      first place, it is a game balance issue. Players that choose to re-load are not
      &quot;lesser&quot; players. The fact of the matter is that if you turn a corner on the
      first level of a dungeon and two kobolds get lucky critical hits on your mage, he might
      die. There is no DM to make a special dispensation because it was the first 10 seconds of
      the adventure; the computer makes you dead. If it is your main PC, game over and you
      re-load, but if it was an NPC, you have a choice. Re-load and paste those worthless
      creatures, or continue and raise your character later. If you re-load, you are breaking no
      rules. The game lets you do it, and you lose a few moments of your time. You may not be
      playing &quot;hardcore,&quot; but there is no rule saying you cannot do it. In major
      battles almost everyone will be doing it (yes, even you). It's the small encounters where
      the defeat was not so marginal that it becomes a sticky issue. Sure, if your entire party
      got pasted by that major villain you might continue on and swallow the loss because you
      squeaked by and gained enough treasure to cover your butt, but if you lost a member to a
      silly mistake or a lucky shot by creatures you normally (by your estimation, anyway:)
      should dominate, the choice gets a little wishy washy. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">If the choice to continue
      involves a later walk to a temple and (relatively) few coins, you may choose to go on
      despite the loss and the difficulty of packing your fallen friend's gear. If however, it
      also entails the permanent lowering of a stat, it's very tempting to just re-load. That is
      a very serious penalty for a mediocre death. There is no glory or heroism in this tale;
      you got wasted by a kobold. Surely you shouldn't be expected to suffer such an indignity
      :) </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">It's purely a game play issue,
      and it maintains the spirit of AD&amp;D, in that death is not necessarily the end for your
      character. It is this spirit that we want to foster in the people who are playing Baldur's
      Gate, but have never played AD&amp;D before. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">That's the reasoning, and some of
      you aren't going to agree. That doesn't make you wrong, but house-rules will stand.</font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>Here's a bit on Scrolling in the game.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The screen is free scrolling. The
      characters are NOT restricted to being on screen at all times. Each person controls their
      own view. You can scroll over to the other side of the map if you wish, but it won't
      effect the view of any other players. All of the characters do NOT have to be on screen. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Example: You are scrolling along
      controlling your character. Player 2 is not limited to seeing only what you do. He scrolls
      HIS view wherever he wishes, and can move his characters wherever he wishes within the
      8/8. If he moves his screen over to where your character is he can see what you do, but it
      does not effect what YOU see or do.</font></small></p>

    those all the time. Come on Brad, toss us a bone here before I go and eat my computer.
    Anything will do...well, anything except for nudies of the development team that is!
    Anyway, the afore mentioned Brad was over on <a href="http://www.themercs.org/cgi-bin/config.pl">TheMercs' Message Boards</a> and had this
    to say on PvP and the NDA's. Check it. (EQVault)</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">First, let me say what I've said
      before, that we will make PvP viable in EverQuest. That's one of the many things the beta
      is for. It is primarily a PvE game, but that means neither that PvP will be ignored nor
      that it won't be viable and fun. If we didn't care about PvP, we would have just made the
      game nonPvP entirely (like many MUDs out there). <br>
      <br>
      Are there 'rumors' that PvP needs to be tuned in EQ? You tell me, but I'll say this: the
      entire point of the beta is to tune and fix things. <br>
      <br>
      Second, I suggest you all be a bit more careful about NDA violations here. <br>

      Hmmm, 9am and I'm all alone in the Legend fortress, having gotten up early after catching
      up on some sleep after the Milestone Madness has passed. Speaking of which, the Milestone
      went well, and Scott and I put together a map which is quite monstrous, yet turned out
      nice and we had several matches of grand scale earlier this week on it. The level consists
      of a Portal Stone world level and Shadar Logoth citadel crafted by yours truly, and
      Forsaken and WhiteCloak citadels constructed by the boy wonder Scott Dalton. Good Stuff...<br>
      <br>
      On the backburner until yesterday, I'm returning to my crusade to make the single player
      game what it should be, thus I'll be spending most of my time working on those maps, and
      communicating with the other team members who have those levels on their plates.<br>
      <br>
      Aaron has concocted an outstanding version of MaShadar which makes me grin with the evil
      possibilities the beast will offer in the game. Aaron has also reconsructed the majority
      of the Angreal code and effects, and I must say he's kicked that task squarely in the ass,
      and they are looking beautiful, as well as functioning much better.<br>
      <br>
      On the home front, I've tried to snag an hour or so a day to play Fallout 2, which is an
      extremely addictive game, and is one of the first games to actually present a mature adult
      theme and content, without attempting to use that aspect as a &quot;shocker&quot; to sell
      more copies... imagine a Mad Max film, with characters who act and speak in manners you
      would fully expect in a post-apocalyptic world, complete with crude dialog, violence,
      prostitution, slavery... all the darker sides of man, and you have the Fallout world. Hats
      off to Black Isle, you guys have my vote for one of the best RPG developers out there. <br>

    Continuing the ongoing effort to <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>confuse the hell out of
    everyone</strong></font>, Greg Peterson was on the Backroom message board further
    explaining Baldur's Gate pre-orders. Speaking of which, I really have to pop over to
    Interplay's site and order this baby.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">First of all let me say THANK YOU
      to everyone who is posting on this board or sending me emails. Our order fulfillment
      company is new, and we are QUICKLY working through issues with them. For everyone who
      sends me a note, there are probably ten who don't know HOW to send me a note, so you are
      really helping us improve our systems.<br>
      <br>
      Second of all, we are going to resolve all issues. So if you are having problems, please
      be patient, we will get to you. If your issue is not being resolved to your satisfaction,
      drop me an email and I'LL make sure you are taken care of.<br>
      <br>
      Third, just so people know, the response to our current offer has been overwhelming.
      Within the last two days, pre-orders on Baldur's Gate have TRIPLED. We have far and away
      broken every pre-order record at Interplay. People at our order entry company are pulling
      their hair out. (I told them about the interest in the game... but I don't think people
      took me seriously) We will be sorting things out today and over the weekend.<br>
      <br>
      Here are the biggest issues currently with the pre-order program (in no priority):<br>
      <br>
      1) Buggy order entry. I have gotten a couple of examples of issues with order entry - i.e.
      errors, not enough address lines, etc. This seems to affect the minority of people, but we
      are scrubbing the entry forms and cleaning things up. This should be resolved today.<br>
      <br>
      2) Charging credit cards. This is confusing even me. Apparently credit cards are not being
      CHARGED, they are just having credit on them 'reserved'. It is as if you have bought the
      product, but won't have to pay anything on your bill until after the product actually
      ships. I think this is confusing and raises a multitude of issues. We will work on this
      today. I want to make this go away.<br>
      <br>
      3) Confusing order confirmation. The order confirmation states &quot;your credit card has
      been billed&quot;, etc, etc. Also, you get a strange email that states the product is on
      'back-order'. Again, not the way I'd like it to work, but apparently there are system
      issues on this one. We are trying to immediately implement a program that states &quot;if
      you are pre-ordering a product, you will receive a back-order notice. This just means that
      your product order has been received, and an order is in queue waiting for inventory to
      arrive&quot;<br>
      <br>
      4) Shipping charges. This is a new one. I can't change what Fedex or UPS charges for
      shipping. I WILL, however, check into rumors that orders have been changed without
      people's permission. This one sounds bizarre to me. More research to be done.<br>
      <br>
      Again, thank you all for your help. I am aiming for 100% satisfaction with our pre-order
      process, so many changes are on the way. Just so you know, our Director of Direct Sales is
      working really hard to get everything worked out. She gets paid based on how many happy

    <small>Sith does it again. Even more Ultima Ascension news to keep us all well fed like a
    bunch of happy Goats. (Well, almost all of us that is)<font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>
    Speaking of happy Goats</strong></font>, Seth is really getting slappy on the boards
    lately? Anyway, here he is on the scripting language.</small></p>
    <i><blockquote>
      <p></i><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"><small>The system we are using is
      home made, and allows the designers to have control of the NPC's / Monsters without having
      to do any C++ or Java experience. On the other had, we also have the ability to have the
      programming department hard code anything else we might come up with. We are lucky to have
      such a powerful system at our disposal.</small></font><i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p></i><small>Here he is again discussing the future of Ultima.</small><i></p>
    </i><blockquote>
      <p><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"><small>What will happen next? We ask
      this question all the time. Right now, our team's goal is to finish Ascension. LB
      productions has several teams, and when the time is right, our next titles will be
      announced. Will there be an Ultima X, XI, and XII? We can't say right now, but Ultima has
      been the longest running series of RPG's, and I'll be it will stay that way for a long
      time to come.</small></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>Here he is again talking about playtesting etc. Especially important after
    seeing Sin lately!</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Very good question. The easy
      answer is that it will be in test until no bugs remain. In reality, we have a 4 month test
      cycle planned, and that will get larger or smaller depending on how things go. We are
      about to start initial testing with a small group, and will add people as we get closer to
      ship.<br>
      <br>
      This is our plan for now. As we get closer to shipping, we will have a better idea.</font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>Talking about humor in the game. Shouldn't be hard for me? Hell, I laugh at
    everything. I laughed so hard when I found out about Monica Lewinsky I thought I broke a
    gasket.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The story of Ascension is
      serious, although there will be characters, and events that are humorous. We feel we have
      a good mix, that will not get in the way of the game, just add to the experience.<br>
      <br>
      The script written by Kim is amazing, and I'm sure everyone will see the depth she has
      brought to the story and characters.<br>
      <br>
      Rest assured, Ascension is not a comedy.</font></small></p>

      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">No, not trying to 'dupe' anyone
      or anything, just trying to do what fans asked us to. Many of you have not been on the
      Fallout2 boards or were fortunate enough (or unfortunate enough) to make it to the
      Fallout2 launch party. It was a lot of fun, both for us, and for the fans that made it.
      However, the overall feedback we got from Fallout2 fans around the world was that they
      didn't like the fact that they had to fly out to California to be at the party. People
      were asking for 'satellite' parties around the country (and in Canada, Europe, Australia,
      Japan). So this is the closest thing we could come up with. We can't be everywhere at the
      same time, but we thought that some stores and fans would enjoy getting together for the
      release of the game - you know, meet people in your community that you might want to game
      with, that sort of thing. So no, it is not some evil conspiracy to corrupt the souls of
      American youths, and no we are certainly not delaying anything on the game for this. We
      just though it would be a cool thing. Whatzamatter? Don't want a free mousepad? </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">We have to walk a fine line
      between total secrecy and total disclosure (because we are now a public company). We
      cannot make 'forward-looking' statements that people could construe to mean one thing, and
      end up meaning something else. Now we all know that a Final Candidate is a good thing.
      However, we also know (or should know) that there is a big difference between a Final
      Candidate and a shrink-wrapped box sitting on a retail shelf. The Final Candidate can have
      all sorts of issues that need to be resolved, etc. Personally, I would love to be able to
      let people know as we move through every step in the process. My concern is that, on the
      off-chance we hit a bump in the road, people will start screaming &quot;you SOB's said you
      had the Final Candidate done in early November!!&quot; (Of course, these are usually the
      people who know the least about the entertainment software industry, but at that point it
      really doesn't matter). Note that this is the single biggest reason why most game
      companies have stopped talking to their fans during the development process. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">This is not so. Every school has
      at least one spell for each level. In the case of illusion, the first-level spell is
      &quot;blindness&quot;. As for a school's effectiveness in battle, the Player's Handbook
      itself states that not all schools are suited to the adventuring life. It will be up to
      you whether you think a particular specialization is worthwhile after the pros and cons
      are weighed. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">No. The area of effect [of a
