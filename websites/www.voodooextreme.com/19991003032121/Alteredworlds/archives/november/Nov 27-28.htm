    <small>Congratulations go's out to Looking Glass for a job well done on Thief! I just got
    the demo and can honestly say that I am most impressed. When I saw this game at E3 all I
    thought was <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Blah, just another FPS with bad AI</strong></font>.
    Time for Sacrates to take an about face and kick himself in the honey lovin. Graphics
    aren't bad looking at all, but this game really has a lot of atmosphere and go's a long
    way in really putting you in the Environment very similar to Half Life. You can even buy
    items before you start the mission. Another thing that really impressed me is that this
    game has a great physics model also.<font color="#FFFFFF"><strong> Almost as good as
    Trespasser itself</strong></font>! I will not doubt Looking Glass again after this
    accomplishment. Right now there are 2 games that rule the roost and that's Half Life and
    Thief, everything else is just chump change. Now all I need is Baldur's Gate and a slew of
    Harem girls and i'll be happy.</small></p>

      re-fight too many battles, you can do it in 20 hours. 30 hours and up is the norm. 50
      hours isn't unreasonable if you really explore and linger places. I knew everything I had

    <small>Brad (Spawn of Satan) was over on the boards posting more info. This time on Mule
    characters possibly scouting ahead for you in dangerous areas. Interesting idea, but i'm
    thinking the <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Mule character would be too weak</strong></font>
    to even visit a dangerous area. Let's see what Brad (SoS) has to say on the matter.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p></i><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">In the latest IGN update a
      dwarf describes the problem of swimming into an unknown area. Taking your main character
      into unknown dangers will be avoided at higher levels due to the death penalty (the loss
      of significant experience points when a character dies, the higher the character level,
      the more points lost). The solution that I expect most players will use is to use mules to
      explore unknown areas and test new monsters. Any comments about this? My explorer will
      probably be a hafling ranger. But once he gets to middle levels I will switch to another
      character (not decided what yet) to build into my main character, as I am sure my ranger
      will fall into a pit or in some way die on several occasions; hence, will never make it to
      high levels.</font></small></p>

      <p><strong><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The thing is, is that
      you'll have to invest a lot of time in this 'mule' character just to get him to the level
      where he can actually scout for you.</font></small></strong></p>
      <p><strong><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">So in that sense, he's

    at least for what it is, and that's a damn fine addition to UO.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The Second Age is a
      no-brainer for current UO players. At only $6.95 to upgrade, it's hard to resist the idea
      of an expansion pack that provides more room to breathe and more creatures to fight.
      Newcomers to the UO universe should be a bit more wary, however, especially with other
      games like EverQuest just around the corner. The Second Age adds some nice new features
      and fixes a few things, but it introduces a whole slew of its own problems. Does this mean
      that we won't play the game? Of course not. We'll still log on every day to bash monsters,
      gather gold, and build upon our reputations. That's just part of the love-hate charm of
      this addictive and frustrating game. But we had honestly hoped for more from The Second
      Age and, after all this time, from the state of Ultima Online in general.</font></small></p>

      basic modes. We have weapon based combat, hand to hand combat, bow combat, and stealth
      mode. Weapon mode features three basic attacks: a thrust, a swing, and a chop. As you gain
      experience you can learn variations off of these base attacks. These variations will
      eventually lead to chain attacks that link moves together in a multiple hit attack
      combination. In certain situations, an interactive move can be performed. Interactive
      moves include fatalities, throws, and power moves. These are not reserved for the player
      alone however. Expect monsters to pick you up by the head and throw you, punch you in the
      face and send you flying head over heels; even pick you up and powerbomb you. Did we just
      say pro-wrestling moves in an RPG? You're damn right we did. Hand to hand mode works much
      like weapon mode with the 3 basic attacks being punch, thrust kick, and jumping sidekick.
      Variations can be learned like the uppercuts and spin kicks. Interactives and combinations
      are also included for some serious martial arts combat. </font></small></p>

    <small>IGN.PC has just kicked up a<a href="http://pc.ign.com/previews/2252.html"> contest</a>
    with <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>all sorts of good things </strong></font>like Shirts,
    Underwear, Dildo's, Beta CD's, you know...the usual contest stuff. Head on over and see if
    you can win anything. I would like to win the big breasted female Elf blow up doll! Sign
    me up!</small></p>

    <small>Brad (Spawn of Satan) was on the boards again posting a bit on Satanic symbols etc
    within the game. Hey, the more the merrier I say. I want my character to look just like
    Marilyn Manson. <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>I'd pick up all those naked female Elves no
    prob then</strong></font>. I could even make my own Manson-like EQ songs such as;
    &quot;I'll kill you and your Ogre too.&quot; or &quot;That Elf smells like piss&quot;.
    Read on.</small></p>

      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">I respect you and
      your parents' concerns over this, however it is NOT a pentagram (nor an upside down
      pentagram). To me it looks kinda like a shuriken (throwing star), but in reality it's just
      a little design one of our artists put on that image with the few pixels he had available.
      <br>
      <br>
      There are no pentagrams in EQ, nor any other real world symbols like that -- we wanted to
      create our own fantasy world with its own symbols, deities, etc. </font></small></p>
