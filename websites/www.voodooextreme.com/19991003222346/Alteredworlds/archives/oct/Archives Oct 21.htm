    <small>Hmm...looks like Sith has been busy today:) There's some more new info on
    Ultima:Ascension up, as well as some choice info on Ultima Online 2 (no, not the 2nd age
    expansion pack, a whole new shebang). First a couple of posts from Bill Randolph on the
    new discussion boards. The first is on the performance of the demo at E3...</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Yes, our performance
      at E3 was sub-optimal. But it was for reasons beyond just frame rate. If you stood in one
      place &amp; looked around, the frame rate typically (on a P300) was around 25 - 30 FPS.
      But, as you'd move through the world, the frame rate would drop to as low as 10. Now, 10
      FPS isn't completely unplayable, although it's unpleasant. What really hurt in that
      version of the engine was the changes in speed--going from fast to slow. Also, there were
      portions of the world that would cause the engine to pause for at least 1/2 second while a
      new section of the world loaded, and thathurt most of all. Notice I said &quot;that
      version of the engine&quot;--we're well aware of our deficiencies at E3 and are attacking
      those portions of the code with gusto right now... Our engine isn't level-based. It loads
      the world in, in chunks, while you move around, so you can circumscribe the entire world
      continuously. But, this introduces interesting performance issues, which we're working
      hard to address!</font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>Second is the awesome news that Ultima Online 2 will be using an engine much
    like U:A... </small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"><small>UO2 won't actually
      be using the Ascension engine per se; but they are shooting for a similar look &amp; feel.
      Ascension's demands on the CPU are high. UO2 will have to take different approaches in the
      areas of collision &amp; poly count to maintain good performance with such an increase in
      # of characters on-screen &amp; moving about the world. Their set of problems are so
      different from ours, that they're developing a parallel set of code; but we do share a
      fair amount of tools.</small></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>Finally another little blurb from the one and only Lord British on the
    possibility of adding extra features via patches after U:A ships... </small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"><small>Though time is
      always a factor in any endeavor, we think we have sufficient time to get in all that is
      needed. That being said... Our basic free form 3D world approach, which allows us to build
      Britannia the way we want, is making shadows hard if not impossible, for now. Doing a
      patch of new monsters, terrain, and events could be fun and worthwhile though. We'll have
      to see when we get there.</small></font></p>

    <i><blockquote>
      <p align="left"></i><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Thank you all so
      much for the feedback so far. We will learn much from hearing these debates. I will jump
      in with a comment now and then. Such as... Even though we are trying to make U:A have the
      best possible look and feel, our goal is really to focus on role-playing. I agree with
      someones U4 comments in that for its day especially, it was a great design, that did not
      depend to heavily on graphics. Yet, on the other hand,I feel no other RPG of the day had
      much if at all better presentation. To fulfill our vision of an immersive RPG we need
      strong visuals. (Shadows, unfortunately, we have not been able to conquer in thisengine
      approach, yet...)<br>

      We are planning quite a few different kinds of armor. And while there are no planned
      &quot;blanket&quot; restrictions on armor being worn, you'll find it difficult to maneuver
      if you are too encumbered. </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">on communicating in
      the game:If you are unconscious or engaged in combat, the global chat system will be
      disabled (if you are dead, you're dead). Sadly, there is nothing that we can do to stop
      people from changing between applications unless we make the game entirely unfriendly to
      Windows. And even if we did that, I'm not certain that we could stop task switching from
      happening. So, the simple fact is that people will chat whether you want them to or not.
      Personally, I have no problem with global chat. It's a fine feature that enhances the game
      for many. There's a few other points that I need to mention: 1) Middle-earth is a HUGE
      game. With 10,000 users in a world at the same time it is not feasible to have truely
      &quot;global&quot; chat. Modems everywhere would gag and choke if we allowed even 1,000
      people to be in a single chat channel. So, the persistant chat channels will be based on
      geographic location (i.e. Shire Chat, Moria Chat, etc). Of course there will be guild chat
      channels and other miscellaneous private forums. 2) Global Chat will exist whether we
      provide it, or Middle-earth players set up IRC or ICQ forums. I feel that the benefits
      outweigh the problems. If you don't want to use global chat, don't use it. You'll have
      more on-screen playing area if you choose not to use it and can live forever oblivious to
      its presence if you like. </font></small></p>

      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Music:Music is vital
      for creating atmosphere and Deus Ex is (better be) a very atmospheric game. We have a
      particular style in mind that will be cool and unique (no driving, techno stuff here!).
      Suffice it to say we want the player to be creeped out and paranoid every moment of the
      game and music will go a long way to creating that kind of mood. Chris Norden (lead
      programmer dude) has some stuff up his sleeve, technology-wise. Hate to be cryptic but I
      don't want to get into specific code, styles or uses or anything right now. Ask again
      later. Just know that music will play an important part in Deus Ex.<br>
      <br>
      Gameplay:Regardless of whether each and every obstacle hallows for multiple
      solutions--which is, as warren said, The Goal(tm)--one thing we really want to support is
      multiple, cusotmized approaches based on play-style. in other words, if you like sneaking,
      then you should be able to sneak, spy and steal your way through Deus Ex. we don't want to
      get to the last 20% of the game and suddenly force the stealthy player to become 'rocket
      man' or whatever. as much as i loved Fallout (a great game), i was angry near the end when
      i could not continue sneaking along and instead had to start slugging it out more. i want
      Deus Ex to do a better job of allowing players to express themselves through the game.

      cinematically in 3D, like what we're doing with dialogue in <b>Redguard</b>, and it's
      something I think we'll see other people do on a much grander scale. Why do cut-scenes
      when your in-game models look so damn good?&quot;</font></small></p>

    <small>Those fluffy Snuffleufugus kind of guys over at <a href="http://www.vaultnetwork.com/">VN</a> have just smacked up some good info on the
    upcoming Gorky 17 (Uh, this name had to come from late night experimental drug sessions?)
    that you'll want to read up on. Here is a small piece and for the rest of this beast head
    on over to VN.</small></p>
    <i><blockquote>
      <p align="left"></i><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Gorky 17 is a
      mix of adventure and strategy-RPG. Remember &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics&quot; and
      &quot;Vandal Hearts&quot;? In those console hits the main focus was on the battles, with
      the plot shown non-interactively in-between. Now add fantasy-full adventures and
      plot-twists, explorations and much, much more! That's Gorky 17! For all you PC fanatics
      out there, here's the description in a nutshell: it's similar to &quot;XCOM&quot;, but
      with a much simpler user interface (doing for strategy what &quot;Diablo&quot; did for
      RPGs), plus implemented adventures (so it's not only a matter of having the right
      strategy, but also using the right objects, getting information through conversations,
      interacting with other characters, etc.). In short, this is state of the art graphics with
      3D characters and a &quot;living&quot; environment. </font></small></p>

      framerate: That first room is a doozy... probably the slowest room in the game. </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">On my P2 266 MMX AGP
      running SGI software rendering, underlying card is a RIVA TNT AGP but I'm not using that

      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Methinks this will
      improve for next release due to a bug I think I found.. I used to get almost 20 fps in
      software rendering in most rooms, 40 tops!! </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">on excessive
      darkness: Yes we will be doing something about it, but I'm kinda of the opinion that some
      people are getting the game even darker than we set it to be... abnormally dark.. it's
      curious.. </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Please, anyone who
      thinks the game is &quot;unplayably dark&quot;, send me a screenshot of the dungeon in the
      Main Entrance, as soon as you step into the dungeon, without moving. Right by the doors to
      the city, looking north. Send me those screenshots and I'll compare them to what it's
      supposed to look like and we'll see if there's some other problem with lighting that I
      don't know about yet. </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">on the ability to
      see players in the 3D view: I don't think it's that difficult. Controlling player avatars
      is just like controlling the current monsters... and we can use many of the same models. I
      have high hopes of getting player avatars and their companions/party members showing up in
      the 3d view before we're done. </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Now of course that
      may not happen due to any number of reasons... and if anyone asks... I didn't say this...
      I was never here... </font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left"><small>And Mike Larossi was talking about what they expect in terms of
    what the game does Mass Market.</small><font face="Arial" color="#C1C1FF"><strong> </strong></font></p>
    <i><blockquote>
      <p align="left"></i><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Unfortunately
      today's market does not allow technologically inferior products to thrive. It's true that
      the hardcore gamer can spot the good games from the bad regardless of graphics but to the
      average gamer they enter a store look at a box and make a decision. Alot of game sales are
      spontaneous bought on a whim sales and before we went to 3D Infinite Worlds was not fit
      for a mass commercial release. Mordor 1 is a prime example. It was made and sold and
      didn't make dick for sales. Alot of you bought M1 but it really didn't make any money at
      all and thats pretty sad. I myself buy games I know I will enjoy. I used to buy everygame
      that came out just so I could say I had it. Nowadays I might buy 1 game a month. Why?
      Because 95% of the games out there suck. Either they are all graphics and no gameplay or
      they are just plain boring. The gaming industry needs a wake up call. With the advancement
      of computer technology alot of companies are too busy thinking of ways to take advantage
      of all this new hardware and are forgetting how to make good games. </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">If we knew we could
      get mass sales with primitive graphics we'd have stuck with them but I know for a fact
      that most of the gamers out there who are big on graphics would take one look at what we
      had and passed it right up. The hardcore market can't generate the sales to make a game
      successful. </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">We are doing the
      best we can to make use of the 3d we incorporated. First it was just the view that was 3D
      and then people asked for monsters so we gave you monsters in 3D. The combat now has
      something to do with the 3D because of the attack range. By the time we are done we hope
      to have a superior product from what M2 was to what Infinite Worlds now is. </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Some of you may feel
      betrayed by us buying into this trend of fancy graphics and selling out to the man. I
      understand where you are coming from when you say it but if you think about it you'll
      understand why it was neccessary. We have about 8-9 people working on IW right now and if
      we can't make a game that will sell we'll all be job hunting when we finish. </font></small></p>

      apologize enough. I&#146;m sorry if I don&#146;t respond quickly to your E-mail (or at all
      in some cases). It is absolutely crazy around here, this is the final push. We are tying
      up loose ends, finishing any, and all gameplay issues. Bugs are being killed in droves,
      multiplayer is nearing completion (and is VERY fun) and is fast becoming the most popular
      way to play BG. I love the single player game myself, but am working on finishing BG multi
      now, cause I already have finished it single player (heh, can&#146;t stop bragging about
      that one ;) ) I thank you for all the support, and I look forward to getting a good night

      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">I thought it had
      been posted previously but if it hasn't, allow me to drop a small bomb on your parade. BG
      will only allow you to dual-class once, so your F/T/M can't be done. Sorry 'bout that, but
      it can't be helped at least until the sequel, if then. </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">A casualty of
