    <small>Since it's near that time of the year when just about everything is gonna be
    released in one massive load before Christmas I am interested in what you guys want. My
    personal list would read off something like this: 2. Trespasser 3. Baldur's Gate. Hmm, you
    may be wondering what I want most? 1. Half Life without a doubt. Why are my first 2 most
    anticipated games non RPG's you may be wondering? Because I am tired of playing cliche
    games and am looking for something willing to take risks and look to the future. Both of
    these games are breaking all the rules and creating new styles of gameplay. I would have
    loved to toss, WOT, U:A and EQ in there too but alas that's the trouble with this
    Industry. Anyway, send me your lists also and i'll have the results up later on.</small></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0"><small>Over-anticipation -
      When exactly does one begin to show off stuff about a game in development? With some
      companies it's when they first come up with a concept. I think the Dragonriders of Pern
      game falls in this category, as do many others. The problem here is that the audience gets
      really excited about a game, only to get really annoyed when it is not released even years
      after the announcement. Also the initial excitement generated by the game is lost if it
      takes too long for the game to come out. For example, when the first screenshots of
      Septerra Core appeared in Computer Gaming World, I was extremely excited about the game as
      were others. Then came months of nothing. No new info, no demo, and most of all no game.
      That was over a year ago. Still no game. So now when Septerra Core does come close to
      being released, they have to build up excitement all over again. All the people who
      remember the original announcement of the game are all wondering, &quot;So where the hell
      have you guys been all this time?&quot; Our game, Deliverance From The Dark, is over a
      year away from release at best. If things get delayed, it could slip to a spring 2000
      release. I don't want to get people too excited about the game only to have their
      excitement turned sour by a long wait and accusations of vaporware. </small></font></p>

    Sacrates</small></a><br>
    <small>Sean L Palmer was on the boards discussing a bit on the name change and graphics in
    Infinite Worlds. </small></p>
    <b><i><blockquote>
      <p align="left"></i></b><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">on the
      graphics: Infinite Worlds is not a Quake-killer or an Unreal-killer by any means. It's not
      a high-fps game, and the graphics, as you stated, are dated. However they are, how should
      I say this, &quot;Good enough&quot;, &quot;Competitive&quot;. And they will be getting
      better. </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">If we were to make a
      game with Unreal quality graphics we'd have to scrap the entire game so far and make a new
      one. We did these graphics so that the original game could be kept intact while making it
      more visually pleasing. Anything more is gonna have to wait til after this game's
      released. </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">on the current level
      of light: We'll definitely be doing something about the dungeon brightness for the next
      release. We did a fairly last-minute change to fix a lighting issue and also to deal with
      some races having the dungeon way too bright and it seems to have broken things. Bear with
      us. </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">I think instead of
      upping the ambient light for races that can see better, we'll be increasing the amount of
      light that all the lights in the game put out, depending on race. So in pitch darkness it
      won't be bright as day like before with the Saris, but the Saris will definitely have
      things brighter than Humans will. Especially where there is already light in the room from
      a torch or something. </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">Also.. be aware that
      there IS a spell which will make things brighter... but I'm not sure which class can cast
      it, or at what level you learn it. IMO it ought to be a newbie spell, and you should be
      able to buy torches in the store if you're not a mage, but that's not my department.. </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">on the meaning of
      the name change to Infinite Worlds: Interplay liked the name. They picked it from a huge
      list of other names we came up with. It's mainly referring I think to the fact that the
      release version will allow people to make custom levels and let other people play those
      new levels on their custom servers.. </font></small></p>

      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">There are normal,
      chain, and plate animations, and three additional mage robe animations. </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">There are also six

      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">Please keep in mind
      that the armor and mage robes look different depending on the sex, race and class of the
      person wearing them. This was done for visual identification reasons. We decided not to
      make the armor race and sex specific because it was too restricting that way. </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">Since we have many
      types of leather, chain, and plate armors in the game, each one has a unique set of colors
      associated with it. This means that every item is unique in at least the color of the
      armor. (Hint: try to find the set of black full plate!) </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">on what characters
      will be impossible to kill: In some of the localized versions, you won't be able to kill
      children. </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">on whether killing
      an NPC will permanently impede progress of completing the game: The worst that can happen
      is that you will lose the opportunity for a sub quest. You will always be able to finish
      the game. </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">on the optimum host
      for multiplayer games: You will definitly want the person with the fastest computer and
      internet connection to be the host. </font></small></p>

    <blockquote>
      <font color="white"><p align="left"></font><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">On whether characters can choose different targets for their multiple
      attacks in one round: No, sorry. This is kind of moot anyway. It is rare that you have
      more than one target in weapon range anyway. The exception is of ranged weapons. We have
      discovered that ranged weapons become too powerful if you can target multiple targets in
      the same round. You have to aim after all ;). </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">As per D&amp;D
      rules, all attack rounds are the same length. If both persons have the same number of
      attacks / round, the person with the faster weapon goes eariler in the round. This is real
      important when attacking mages or priests. You will want to use a quick weapon to disrupt
      those pesky mages. If the weapons have different ranges, each persons's attack round
      starts when they get within weapon range of their target. </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">You will only get

    Yep, the game formerly known as Prince, err Mordor II, has a <a href="http://www.vbdesigns.com/infiniteworlds/frames.htm">new website address</a> and a
    new post on bugs popping up in the beta version 0.993b.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0"><small>&quot;WOW. Talk
      about FEEDBACK! First of all, my apologies to all of you having problems. It's odd --
      about 30-40% of the players are having Video/Hang related problems (and sometimes can't
      play at all) and the rest are running fine (with minor glitches). Needless to say that
      these numbers are unacceptable and we will be releasing a 0.9931 patch as soon as we can
      address the issues. In the past 48 hours we have received more than 250 bug reports, and
      many general comments/feedback reports. This is a GOOD thing -- thank you to all who took
      the time to get back to us (even though not all of the reports were very... appreciative
      *grin*). One thing I want to bring up is the fact that people keep comparing 0.993b to the
      stability of 0.992b. In reality, the differences between the two versions are closer to
      those of 0.90 and 0.992. We have a good 6 months of new development into the latest
      version which has never been publically tested (only a handful of a dozen private testers
      -- and we can only get so many OS/Video Card scenarios out of that). PLEASE be patient
      with us -- for those of you who remember 0.90, it was even buggier than this, but we fixed
      it, and just like that version, we will fix this new one and make it playable for almost
      everybody. Just keep the bug reports and feedback coming in and we will do out best to
      make sure that each subsequent release runs better, and causes less of a headache. Soon,
      those of you who are worried about computer problems will only be worried about character
      development issues!<br>
      <br>
      REMEMBER -- THIS IS A BETA! There's a very good chance that almost every asthetic issue or
      bug related problem will be fixed very soon, so keep the faith. We've been through this
      before, and we came out on top. We will do the same here.<br>
      <br>
      Thanks much for the support &amp; keep it comin' -- after all, it's the players that help
      make the game what it is!&quot;</small></font></p>

      Systems, Inc. The EA lawyers wanted to have the lawsuit brought by certain Ultima Online
      gamers moved from superior court to small claims court. Instead, Judge Judith McConnell
      set a trial date in superior court of February 11. At that time, opening arguments will
      take place in Case No. 718593: Ken Hinther, et al., Plaintiffs v. Electronic Arts, Inc.;
      et al., Defendants.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;This is big news for us,&quot; George Schultz, the attorney representing the six
      gamers said today after attending the hearing.<br>
      <br>
      The case will now be heard in superior court which requires that money damages sought by
      plaintiff's be at least US$25,000. Small claims court on the other hand sets a limit of
      $5,000 for damages.<br>
      <br>
      EA's attorneys can still file a written motion to have the trial moved to small claims
      court - and they likely will. Calls to an Electronic Arts spokesperson were not returned
      at press time.<br>
      <br>
      Today's decision has no bearing on the earlier rejection by Judge McConnell of Schultz'
      request to have his case heard as a class action lawsuit (which potentially would open the
      case up to thousands of unhappy gamers). Although Schultz said today he would likely bring
      a new motion for class certification and will also amend his original complaint. These
      moves by Schultz will address the recent release of the Ultima Online add-on, The Second
      Age, which Origin is charging North American gamers for $6.99. Schultz says UO add-ons had
      been promised to gamers free of any charge.</font></small><font face="Arial" color="#C1C1FF"><strong> </strong></font></p>

    <small>Those wacky biscuits over at Larien Studios have kicked up a fat mother of an
    update. Lots of good stuff that only your mother would make you eat. We're talking grade A
    spinach LMK update news. Here's a small bite for the complete meal head on over to the <a href="http://www.lmkworld.com/lmk/engl/index.html">LMK site</a>.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">AI wise the main
      focus in the last weeks has been speed. I've stuffed the npc's with so much stuff to do
      that I started getting some performance problems. This has a lot to do with the fact that
      the entire world is running in real time. Even if there is no player on a particular spot,
      the npcs are stilling acting realistically so that when you get to that spot, the state of
      the world looks like it's been lived in. Which brings me to an interesting observation
      made by Bert the other day. André, an artist at Attic, had made this rendering of an axe
      laying on a chopped piece of wood. When we received the rendering, our immediate reaction
      was, this is cool but he rendered both objects together, which given the goal that every
      object which looks like it can be used or moved can actually be used or moved, wasn't ok.
      So we were going to send him an email asking him to render them apart, when Bert said
      something so trivial and simple, that I nearly choked. He said: &quot;Hey, this is cool.
      It really makes the world look alive&quot;. Since making the world live is my departement
      I started wondering why he would say such a thing. After all, I have all these AI tricks
      built in which make the characters appear like they are doing something sensible in the
      world, and then a stupid axe (sorry André ) lying on a chopped piece of wood made him
      think the world looked alive. Why was that I wondered? It took me some time to realize a
      fundamental thing I had been overlooking. If you browse through books about artificial
      life you'll find frequent occurences of the phrase &quot;emergent behaviour&quot;. The
      meaning of this is that life seems to be not a property of some local or atomic elements,
      but rather of the whole of these elements from which life &quot;emerges&quot;. I'm very
      well aware of it, and the goal of having all these AI tricks in LMK has always been to
      come up with a combination which was going to suggest &quot;emergent&quot; behaviour, but
      somehow, so engrossed with the specifics of doing specific actions, I managed to forget
      about it. I had like this list of things my characters had to do, they have to eat, they
      have to talk to each other and so forth, but the basic reason why I was doing this had
      completely slipped my mind: I wanted to suggest life. And what better way to suggest life
      than having a woodcutter who forgot his axe while he ran off to his wife to eat? So I'm
      busy now with something that might more than all my tricks suggest life, but as I'm not
      sure it'll make it to the game, I'll just shut up about it for a bit.</font></small></p>

    <small>Over at the ever so lovely yet never over smelly IGN PC, they tossed up a <a href="http://pc.ign.com/previews/3548.html">Preview</a> of Anachronox that you guys may
    want to check out. It's not exactly as big as the biscuits your mother makes but it makes
    for some good reading. Check it out.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">The storyline behind
      Anachronox is somewhat cloudy and mysterious, just as the designers at ION Storm wanted
      it. The spaceport Anachronox, located inside a Sender (a planet-size sphere covered with
      thousands of hyperspace-enabling spikes), is a dark and desolate city once inhabited by
      millions of plague-ridden aliens. Now it's the den of racketeers, punks, drug dealers, and
      shysters from across the galaxy. The law is pretty much non-existent in Anachronox, so the
      scum of the universe are free to do as they wish. </font></small></p>

    <i><blockquote>
      <p align="left"></i><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">I haven't posted
      in some time, so I thought I'd drop a note and encourage you to stop by our web page and
      check us out. Our Beta is nearing. </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">RuneSword is a
      construction set *and* a game. It's about playing *and* creating. </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">RuneSword is an
      editor for the &quot;Dungeon Master&quot; in all of us. It is all Windows; there's no
      manual coding in a text editor. We have property sheets for every object in the game and
      basically, you click and go. The intent is to make it easy to get in, do your thing, and
      get back out. </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">Some of RuneSword's
      features are unique (at least, we think they are so far). We're happy about Themes, the
      &quot;grist for the mill&quot; of the Random Dungeon generator. A Theme is a collection of
      elements --- rooms, creatures, items and what have you. The idea here is you can build
      part of a module and have the editor fill in the rest using one or more Themes. So you
      have a Dark Temple and you want to populate it. You make a few rooms by hand. Drag in an
      Evil Temple Theme and click. The computer fills out the rest. This can be used to assist
      you in completing a module or add randomness while you're playing so even you the creator
      will be surprised. </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">Another feature is
      that it's completely component based. We're going to have Monster Manuals and Treasure
      Troves that you click and get what you want. And you can build any object from scratch or
      use an existing and tweak it. Want a Dragon? Click. Done. How about a wand? Click. Done.
      Add a spell to that Mage? Click. Done. And I like that Trap. Click. Done. </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">All of these things,
      Themes, Monsters, NPC's, Characters, Items, etc. are objects, and can be made and stored
      up in libraries like other components and traded around the web. Anyone can add to these
      libraries. Maybe there was an excellent artifact or demonic vampire you've used in a
      campaign before--you could just contribute those to the library, and maybe you'll find
      them pop up in someone else's tome. </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">And that's just the
      beginning. </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">Check us out. Let us
      know your thoughts. Because you make the game. We're just writing it.</font></small></p>

    <small>So here I am listening to Manson's newest CD on this new Sound Card and loving
    every second of it. But you know the best part? You got it, I can listen to this great
    music and read some great RPG news at the same time. I can also chew gum and walk at the
    same time also. Man of many talents eh? Anyway, Sinjin Bain was on the RTK boards of love
    and had this goodness to spout.</small></p>
    <strong><i><blockquote>
      <p align="left"></i></strong><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">on the
      scope of the game: The major areas of the world you will visit; the city of Krondor
      (including the sewers), the wilderness travelling, Haldon Head, the Black Pearl Temple are
      as detailed as we could make them within the context of a shippable game. As it stands
      now, the game already requires 2 CD&#146;s. </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">The action takes
      place in a small geographic region along the coast of the bitter sea, the map in PC Gamer
      is of all of Midkemia. We though people would like that more as an insert. The smaller
      geographic region is explored in great detail... so, again, it's a matter of scale, not of
      size. The game is huge. </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">on the story and
      quests: RtK has a much richer and more defined story [than Betreyal at Krondor] that
      required some tradeoffs in the openness of the world and number of side quests, this is
      something that has been reported in many previews so far. Fortunately, it seems as if the
      quality and depth of the story is so good that this is almost always viewed as a positive.
      The side quests are deeper and hopefully contribute to the fullness of the overall story.
      It is a three tiered story structure; first, the overall game-long story... second,
      individual chapter specific stories and quests... and third inter-chapter related events
      and story elements. We are really trying to do something new here&#133; and that is
      present a level of story that has previously not been previously accomplished. This is an
      area we really wanted to excel in for obvious reasons (Raymond E. Feist.) </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">You really don't
      &quot;go to some guy&quot; to get quests, it's a bit more subtle than that. Curing the
      overall quest, for instance, in one chapter you have to solve a murder. No one overtly
      tells you this is the quest, you discover the quest yourself and then solve it. In
      addition to this quest within the chapter there are other smaller subquests, and then even
      under that layer, again, you are free to poke around the city to explore/fight/find
      treasure, etc. </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">The game is
      &quot;progressive&quot; in nature in that you move through the environment and story, it
      is not circular where everything looks the same. </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">on difficulty
      settings: We have hardness levels that will affect how the game needs to be played. I
      don&#146;t want to get into all the details of this but in general, for instance, you
      would expect that the harder the setting of the game the more dangerous combat is and the
      more creative solutions to combat and spellcasting / creation the player must come up
      with. In addition you would expect that inventories of vanquished opponents will differ
      between hardness settings (you probably won&#146;t find great potions just lying around in
      the hard setting, you&#146;ll have to find / buy the recipes and ingredients and brew
      &#145;em up&#133; sorry.</font></small></p>

    <small>Not much news running around this morning. Typical Saturday, although the past two
    Saturdays have been very good to us in the news department. We'll see if things pick up
    later. Anyway as you can tell I've archived this fat pig so it should load a bit faster
    now. Nothing like Saturday mornings after drinking a few cold ones last night though.
    Considering i've gotta be on the Courts this morning teaching! This new Sound Card is da

      <p align="left"></i></b><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">on selecting
      multiple targets with a character capable of multiple attacks: No, sorry. This is kind of
      moot anyway. It is rare that you have more than one target in weapon range anyway. The
      exception is of ranged weapons. We have discovered that ranged weapons become too powerful
      if you can target multiple targets in the same round. You have to aim after all ;) </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">on attack rounds: As
      per D&amp;D rules, all attack rounds are the same length. If both persons have the same
      number of attacks / round, the person with the faster weapon goes eariler in the round.
      This is real important when attacking mages or priests. You will want to use a quick
      weapon to disrupt those pesky mages. If the weapons have different ranges, each persons's
      attack round starts when they get within weapon range of their target. </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">on infravision: You
      will only get infravision if only one character is selected and that character is
      selected. It used to be if any of the selected characters had infravision but it on too
      much and had stopped being an advantage to those who had the ability. </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">on awareness of
      traps: If anyone finds a trap or secret door then everyone becomes aware of it. There is
      no logical reason for this, it just works better in multiplayer, although a few people did
      try to sucker their friends into setting off the trap for them. With friends like these
