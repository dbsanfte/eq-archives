      what to say really. It's a bit black and gloomy. But I suppose that adds to the realism.
      However the graphics (even when accelerated) look a bit crappy. A sort of hybrid between
      Quake 1 and Quake 2. But when your sneaking around the graphics don'g really make a big
      impact. So I suppose it's not really a big deal that the graphics suck in this game. </p>
      <p>Well suck is a bad word for me to use. Better adjectives: dark, gloomy, scary, grey,
      black, square, blocky (sometimes). But despite this the level design is fantastic, zombies

    It should be interesting the see how the Reviews on this game turn out. All I know is that
    from what I saw of it, Wolfenstien's AI could have outsmarted the guys in Thief. Anyway
    the Lads over on Gamepen have slipped up a<a href="http://www.gamepen.com/pc/thief/preview.html"> Preview</a> on this Gem. Here's a

      muscle-bound space marine (Doom), or space criminal on the run in an alien world (Unreal).
      He isn&#146;t fighting dimensional intruders (Half-Life), dinosaurs (Trespasser), or
      cybernetic tank beasts (Quake 2). No brow-ridged warriors to face (Klingon: Honor Guard),
      mutant drug addicts (SiN), terrorists (Rainbow Six) or even Stormtroopers, be they of the
      Nazi (Wolfenstein 3D) or Imperial (Dark Forces) variety. He is a thief, and a good one. He
      must face guards, fanatic cultists, undead, and monsters in the pursuit of treasures and
      mission beyond what we&#146;ve seen before. This isn&#146;t &#145;run and gun&#146; this

    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">There has been much
      talk lately about the future of computer role-playing games. Some say that they are in the
      middle of a popularity resurgence, while others cry that CRPG's in the &quot;classic&quot;
      sense are dead. Yet the argument is not necessarily a binary thing-there are some people
      that feel the classic CRPG has simply been scattered finely throughout computer gaming and
      that it has evolved away from its roots. I think proponents of the latter opinion have a
      good point. You could make the argument that the RPG has been one of the most influential
      forces on computer games of all types, having permeated every other genre to such a degree
      that it is no longer even noticeable. Think about all the adventure games and action games
      that have RPG-like inventory systems. Think about the origin of the fictional settings for
      games like Master of Magic, Myth or Warcraft. Think about all the terminology that has
      crept into other non-RPG games-even &quot;character&quot; itself is used in a fashion that
      more in common with paper RPGs than with fiction in the context of computer games. It's
      not &quot;a character,&quot; it's &quot;your character.&quot; </font></small></p>

      Troll Shadowknight is the best for solo play. You can play for a long time as one of these
      very strong and magical creatures, but since no one character can be a jack-of-all-trades,
      you&#146;re not going to get to see all the coolest stuff. This creates the incentive that
      if you want to enjoy the whole game you will want to band as a party. In general we can

    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">I would tend to
      agree with Ducky's assessment. If the level of nudity of the concept art offended you, I
      would imagine the rather dark themes that run through Shock 1 AND 2 (murder, mayhem,
      betrayal, despair) might also offend you. Computer games tend to explore some of the
      darker aspects of life. We intend to make a product that honors the spirit of the
      original, and in many ways, that's a pretty dark spirit. There are some great games that
      don't feature extreme violence (I've really been enjoying Railroad Tycoon 2 as of late and
      I hear Grim Fandango is pretty cool). If Shock offends, you should definitely check these
      titles out. You won't be sorry. </font></small></p>

    <small>Now here is a shocker! According to Gary Brandy (Developer at Paradigm
    Entertainment) who informed VN that they have stopped production on<a href="http://www.skies.net/"> Skies</a> and are exploring different options due to the
    fact that Sega-Soft is jumping ship on the Publishing end of the business. These guys had
    a nice booth at E3 and made a good presence. The game itself looked graphically fantastic
    and I was looking forward to this title. Also <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>the concept of
    your character evolving through multiplayer was fairly interesting</strong></font> too, in
    that you started as a young winged character and grew as you played. It would be sad not

    Janus Anderson was back on the boards adding a bit more to the Elf conversation. This bit

    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">We&#146;ve been
      tossing around quite a few ideas regarding limiting elves in Middle-earth. After quite a
      bit of discussion we&#146;ve decided that an enforced waiting period, along with some
      in-game goals to complete would suffice to limit the influx of new elves. A new player has
      the choice of making a character of any race (except elf) when he first begins playing. To
      create an elf character, the player must have been active in the game for a certain number
      of hours AND achieved a prerequisite level of elven lore with an existing human, dwarf or
      hobbit character. While this does not enforce a population cap, I feel that it will help
      to foster an elven community that has knowledge of the game and hopefully role-playing
      personality.</font></small></p>
      <p><strong><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Oops! You got me... I had

      actually implement them since we are constantly coming up with better ideas for systems.

    <small>If you guys recall, I had an<a href="http://www.voodooextreme.com/Alteredworlds/interviews/ryan_valhalla.htm"> Interview </a>a
    while back with Ryan Dueckman who is working on Valhalla, <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>an
    incredibly tuned&nbsp; looking Viking Adventure/RPG/Action game</strong></font>. Just got
    a little &quot;Under the counter&quot; from him that you may be interested in. Check it.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"><small>Basically,
      everything you've seen in <br>
      the original screenshots have been scrapped, rewritten, improved, redrawn, and optimized
      to the point where it's no longer recognizeable as the same game.&nbsp; Nothing has
      changed as far as the <br>
      game design is concerned, but the entire graphics engine has been completely rewritten to
      compete with future graphics engines as well <br>
      as take advantage of newer hardware. Unfortunately, as it happens so often in this
      business, what started as a 1-month overhaul has ended up taking us 3-4 months to
      complete, causing the lack of news as of <br>
      late.</small></font></p>

            around picking your nose hair? You ever want to get thrown into a virtual world? Well, the
            Carnivores demo might be just what the doctor ordered. Not exactly action packed but the
            environments are really something to look at. This puts Trespasser to shame. Visually i've
            got mine decked out at max ress and all features turned on and still have high frame rates
            with no slowdown. The Dinos aren't exactly aggressive but will sneak up on you. This is a
            good example of what can be done with outdoor environments. Full version should be in
            stores late November. <a href="http://www.actionforms.kiev.ua/demo/CarnivoresDemo.exe">Check
