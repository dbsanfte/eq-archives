    <small>Hehehe...thought we became an Everquest News site there didn't ya? We're just
    getting a lot of flowage now that many Press pages like myself and others are finally in
    it and are allowed to talk without breaking the NDA. Anyway, Here's a few Bites from<font color="#FFFFFF"><strong> BG found on the Boards</strong></font>. First is on teh
    Experience Cap.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><b><p></b></i><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">To understand the
      experience cap, you have to understand the design concept behind Baldur's Gate. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">When designing Baldur's Gate, we
      wanted to address what we thought was the biggest flaw in many of today's RPG's. In order
      to deliver great plot-line, they had all become too linear. Many RPG's began to feel (in
      my own opinion) a lot like adventure games. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Baldur's Gate we wanted to be as
      non-linear as possible, while still allowing you to follow a major plot to get you
      (eventually) through the game. Want to crash through the main quest in 50 hours? Some
      people did. Want to savor the gaming experience and spend 200 hours cleaning out every
      nook and cranny? Other people find that more enjoyable... </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">In order to fulfill this goal, we
      had to design the ENTIRE game so that at any point you could wander into a new area and
      find it entertaining and challenging. The only way to do that was to populate the entire
      world for a narrow experience range of characters - say from levels 3-6th. The main quest
      line is designed to gradually increase in difficulty until the final battle is pretty
      challenging for characters at.... 89,000 experience points. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Many of you have found that
      starting out, if you wander away from the main quest line this game (in the outdoor areas)
      can be very hard. Likewise, many have found that if you develop your characters in the
      main plot and THEN hit the outdoor areas, the game is (relatively) easy (we still threw in
      a number of challenges throughout the game). The design of this game was an art as much as
      a science in balancing MANY factors to 'maximize' gaming fun for players of levels UP TO
      89,000 experience points. Let's face it...kobolds just aren't that intimidating to a 10th
      level Fighter. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">So the game is designed to be
      played and enjoyed MOST within the experience point ranges we have set up. I am flattered
      when I hear of people wanting to remove the experience point cap - simply because it means
      that they like the game so much they don't want it to end - they want to continue to
      adventure and continue to advance. We will have the expansion available soon - and perhaps
      additional add-on products after that. Nothing would make us happier than to get to a day
      where you COULD eventually start in one area and one game, and work your way through
      several games/chapters while continuing to adventure in the same fantasy world and with
      continuity of plot (i.e. same NPC's carried over, etc). </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">We're gamers too, remember... </font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>Here's a bit on fallen Paladins.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">A fallen paladin has strayed from
      the true path of his deity and from the path of goodness. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Though he may maintain Lawful
      Good aligment because it was a momentary deviation of behavior, he has forever fallen from
      grace. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">He will ALWAYS remain a fallen
      paladin and will have lost all of his special powers for all time... for all intents and
      purposes he is a fighter, but WITHOUT a fighter's ability for weapon mastery and dual
      classing... </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">on the amount of additional
      character levels planned for the expansion: By levels you mean character levels, right? </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">We are still working on it.
      Remember that from this point out you pretty much double experience points to make each
      level. So to go from 89,000 and 7th level as a cleric, you'd need 450,000 to hit 10th
      level... so even if we said 2-3 more levels we'd probably be talking 3-4x the experience
      amount of monsters / quests than were in the original game... </font></small></p>

    was<font color="#FFFFFF"><strong> so long and luxurious that i'd post it here</strong></font>.
    Read on oh curious one. May Bhudda urinate in your footsteps. </small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Ok, what people commonly refer to
      as LAG has 1 of 4 sources: </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">1. Internet Latency -
      Distinguished by high ping times and/or packetloss<br>
      2. Connection Flooding - Data transfer rates at top of modem specification.<br>
      3. Client Slowdown - Distinguished by a drop in framerate, frame droping when making fast
      turns, mouse skipping.<br>
      4. Server Slowdown - Distinguished by a number of issues, more below. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"><br>
      1. Internet latency can cause things like doors not opening immediatly when clicked upon,
      trades not occuring as soon as you drop the item on the recipient, NPC's not reacting
      quickly when you try to talk to them, /tell's and /says taking time to reach the
      recipient. It is always accompanied by the green LAG-O-METER showing an indication of
      internet latency (high ping/packet loss). You may also see (when you or they are
      experiencing internet latency) a closely followed character disappear. This is caused when
      you are following closely and they make a fast turn or stop, thus causing you to run right
      by before your client is updated. The speed at which you run across the terrain is NOT
      affected by this issue. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">2. Connection flooding occurs
      when the amount of data being exchanged by the client and the server exceeds modem spec.
      This can occur when there is a LOT of something going on in the immediate area. It has
      symptoms equal to #1, with the exception that instead of showing high ping and packet
      loss, it shows a high transfer rate. To give you an idea, the average transfer rate when
      idle with noone around is roughly 250Bps (that's bytes). When running through your average
      open area zone with average occurances happening on all sides, this goes up to about
      500Bps. In the average dungeon, with your typical close quarter chaos, this goes up to
      around 1100Bps. In an all out free-for-all with a high number of people in an enclosed
      area, this approaches 2500Bps. The 28.8K modem is capable of transfering roughly 3500Bps,
      so thier is quite a bit of room to grow. This does not affect the speed in which you run
      across the terrain. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">3. Client slowdown. This is
      caused by one of a number of things, among them, your video card, processor, RAM, and free
      harddrive space. It's precise syptom is a decrease in rendering performance. This
      currently occurs with a few spells and will be fixed by final. Low grade client slowdown
      may occur in resource intensive areas (high polygon count, large number of textures) with
      the minimal system config after final. This can also occur if a LARGE number of people get
      in a very small area thus increasing the poly or texture count. This can affect the speed
      in which you run across the terrain. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">4. Server side slowdown hasn't
      been an issue since two weeks into phase 3 when the servers were being highly loaded. It
      was characterized by all the issues in #1, but without the LAG-O-METER indicating a
      problem. It is very easy to spot which is why it was fixed very quickly. Also, it was
      normal when this was occuring for the data transfer rate to jump between max and min every
      other second or so. Again, this isn't an issue any longer. This, if it does occur will not
      affect the speed in which you run across the terrain. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">How does this all differ from UO?
      Simple. UO's infantile network code required server interaction for every step, every
      action you made. The client did not update the server with the current character position,
      the server updated the client. This is where you get the
      &quot;Step..lag...lag...lag...Step, Step, step, Step...bounce back to where you were 3
      steps ago&quot; manifestation of lag. UO wrapped all the lag one could experience into one
      manifestion of lag. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Now I know some people are going
      to jump in and say that this makes the code in EQ hackable. Someone is going to say
      &quot;I'll just write a client that sends phony update information to the server and I'll
      be able to go much faster!&quot;. This will not happen in EQ. The server will validate the
      update code received by the client to see if it is acceptable given the various effects on
      the character and take appropriate action. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">So let's not call it lag, UO had
      lag. EQ is not suseptable to the Lag that was experienced in UO. People are playing this
      game now with constant pings of 1000 and 50% packetloss and will tell you there is
      &quot;little if any lag&quot;. Think about that for a moment. </font></small></p>

    </blockquote>
    <p><small>Appendage: (Not that kind perv) One thing on my part about this subject. Abashi
    just slapped the monkey right in the ass with that last one. He is so true it's not even
    funny. From my experience, using a 33.6 just to test and running a cable modem normally I
    can honestly say this is the single best piece of networking I have had the pleasure to
    play with other than Quake 2. But even Quake 2 out of the box<font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>
    stunk like an unwashed Baboon</strong></font>, EQ is still only in Beta and runs like a
    champ. Ever wonder what a game with no lag would be like? Well prepare yourselves your
    salvation is nearly here.</small></p>

    Bit O' EQ goodness</strong></font></a> <a href="mailto:sacrates@voodooextreme.com"><small>-

    <small>Abashi was doing the over-time on the boards lately. This first one comes from
    someone who has no social life and thinks Sony is against all Solo players by forcing them
    to team up with others. <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Hell, I don't even think Abashi
    should have answered him in the first place</strong></font>. The kid needs to learn that
    this is what these types of games are about. If he wants Solo play tell him to go out and
    but Zelda on his Nintendo! Sorry had to get that off my incredibly masculine chest.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">...is that EverQuest is a
      multiplayer game. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">But to go just a little bit
      deeper, if EverQuest were balanced so that solo play was easy, then people who chose to
      group would get bored because it is too easy. By balancing Everquest so Group play is
      manageable and fun, then it makes things difficult for the solo players. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Solo play is certainly supported
      for people in EQ, you just have a limited selection on what you can choose to play, where
      you can go (and live), what you can earn, and how fast you can get there. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Everquest is balanced for groups,
      that (thankfully) will not change.</font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>Next one is on Class balance etc. Abashi hits the nail on the head with this one
    as classes are extremely well balanced at the moment.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">I want to stress that all classes
      will be balanced, no classes will &quot;suck&quot;. Rogues are better melee fighters than
      any hybrid, and are only second to the warrior and monk. They have skills that are needed,
      and yes they can steal a bundle. The backstab is fierce, and thier best form of attack, of
      course it has nothing to do with &quot;3x damage&quot;. Thier high agility, dexterity, and
      the fact they use fast weapons means they will get the max potential out of thier weapons
      probably more than any other class. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The rogue is best suited for
      group play where thier backstabs will have the most effect. </font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>This next one is for you freaks who are fans of using foul names in your MP
    sessions.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Currently, we are far less
      concerned with literary names than with inappropriate and offensive names. Of course, the
      name policy is still being developed, not certain what well happen in final (beyond axing
      inappropriate and offensive names)</font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>This next one is a mini review. Abashi is in Bold.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Must a mob actually die for
      experience to be doled out? </font></small></p>
      <p><strong><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Yes. </font></small></strong></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">: Shouldn't I get experience for
      chucking a rock or some other distant area effect at a hill giant, successfully doing some
      damage and then running like mad? </font></small></p>
      <p><strong><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">No, too abusable. </font></small></strong></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">:Is experience divied up
      according to the amount of damage done? </font></small></p>
      <p><strong><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">No. Think &quot;electoral
      college&quot;. He who does the most damage gets 100% of the experience. </font></small></strong></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">:Is the amount of experience
      available from a mob predetermined, or is it variable? </font></small></p>
      <p><strong><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Variable. Base value +/-
      level differential bonus/penalty. </font></small></strong></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">:If the combat lasts a really
      long time and the mob has the opportunity to heal sufficiently, shouldn't that be worth
      more experience than a quick kill? </font></small></p>
      <p><strong><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">No, too abusable. </font></small></strong></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">: Can I drag a combat out for
      hours by doing some minor damage, and then casting a calm spell on the mob, would this
      tactic rack up experience points? </font></small></p>
      <p><strong><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">No.</font></small></strong></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>And an extra morsel on combat and XP.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Overall, it works like this: </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">1. The person who did the most
      damage gets the experience.<br>
      2. IF THAT PERSON is in a group, the experience is then split between the members of the
      group. </font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>Next one is on colors used in combat etc.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">When people are speaking of
      white, blue, yellow, green or black they are referring to the color of the message
      returned by /con. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Red: Indicates the creature is
      far above your level<br>
      Yellow: Indicates the creature is above your level<br>
      White/black: Indicates that the creature is your level.<br>
      blue: Indicates the creature is below your level<br>
      green: Indicates that the creature is far below your level. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">People fighting solo usually have
      to go for things in the low blues (just a bit tougher than green, learned by experience).
      Good well rounded groups go after high-blues, white/blacks, yellows, the the occational
      low red (again, learned by experience). </font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>On combat with Wizards etc, etc.</small></p>
