    <small>Although I have nothing against Power-gamers especially in single player as I am
    one myself. But in Multiplayer it's an altogether different story. In an online
    environement, personal interaction is the key to it's success. You know, all those
    articles you read saying the Community is the key.<font color="#FFFFFF"><strong> It's
    true, every single one of them</strong></font>. Powergaming has it's place but not at the
    cost of ruining others experiences within the game. Something to take into account the
    next time you charge into a frey and bring out the Train from Hell. Anyway,
    Everquestnews.com have kicked up an <a href="http://www.everquestnews.com/lite/article7.html">Editorial </a>on just this subject
    so check it out. Damn, I am in a ranty mood today.</small></p>

    Sacrates</small></a><br>
    <small>Believe me, I'm one of the bitchers in this case. I don't particularly like or
    enjoy the dialogue screens popping up every time <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>one of your
    companions Pimps on one of the locals</strong></font>. Anyway James Ohlen was on the
    Developers Board to dish out some sauce in this department. And he does a good job of
    getting his point across.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p></i><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">There have been many
      complaints about the game pausing during dialogue or stores. I would like to explain our
      reasons for designing the game this way, and then hopefully convince you that it ain't
      that bad. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Dungeons and Dragons has always
      been a party based game, and as such involves co-operation and characters adventuring
      together. During an adventure every party member should know what is going on and work
      together at possible solutions to their problems. We felt that in Baldur's Gate,
      co-operation would be impossible if each player did not know the story of the game.
      Therefore we felt it important that every player had a chance to see what each NPC had to
      say. Was it a bad decision? We won't know until we get feedback from YOU the game players
      (the ultimate authority on design decisions). </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">We can't change this feature in
      multi-player as it is an integral component to the game. TO change the way dialogue works
      would be to make a new game. This is not to say we aren't looking into multi-player
      dialogue - it will be something that is discussed for BG2. For those of you who have
      voiced concerns, know that this 'problem' becomes less prevalent later on in the game. You
      start in Candlekeep, where there are lots of people to talk to. In the wilderness there
      are very few people to talk to (and lots of monsters to kill), in dungeons there are few
      people to talk to. Only in the cities will the dialogue window pop up regularly. Trust me,
      once past Candlekeep it won't be as noticeable. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Multi-player can be fun, but
      remember that the game is a party based game, and as such should be played together. Try
      to stay in a group and it will be much more satisfying. </font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>My turn damnit. I completely understand where he's coming from. But the fact is
    does it make the game fun in Multiplayer? That is the point of the matter. In my
    experience it made it tedious and repetetive since we already heard this same spew before
    in single player and <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>we inherantly want something a little
    different while playing Multiplayer don't we</strong></font>? At least when I played
    Diablo I know I did. Excuse that rant....just me talking out my ass again.</small></p>

    <small>Sorry, no big Beta gravy to add on top of those biscuits but hell, it's EQ news all
    the same and we all love the smell of that. With that said, Thorim was over on the boards
    doing what he does as an EQ Guide...spilling the beans. First, he bitch slaps the kids
    that are playing the EQ Beta right now and not &quot;Testing&quot; it. From what I hear,
    Sony was a little &quot;loose&quot; (<font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Almost Lewinsky loose
    too</strong></font>) with who they chose for Beta 3. </small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Please try to understand
      something. The game is currently in *BETA*. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The anti-twinking rules that are
      currently in effect are only in effect for beta, so that the data being collected by the
      dev team isn't skewed by someone advancing faster than they should because of higher level
      help. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Now, as to your specific
      question. There is no way that a low level character could provide a service to a high
      level character that would justify a legitimate reward of an item that is beyond the
      ability of the lower level to get on his/her own. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">For beta only, 'gifts' (which is
      what this really is) are not legal. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Remember, we are supposed to be
      testing the game, not just playing it for our own amusement.</font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>By the way, for those not in the know, &quot;Twinking&quot; is the act of higher
    level characters giving away free items to Improve lower level Characters stats. (i.e.
    Diablo etc)</small></p>

    <small>In just a few more days we should have some killer reviews coming in so check back.
    I've had to push them back a bit due to these two games called Tribes and Baldur's Gate. I
    swear my ass is starting to grow roots into the chair. I'm sitting there playing Tribes
    thinking, well after my next kill.....ok after the next assault....alright after I get
    their damn flag...etc. And then to top that off I start up BG and it's way past dinner and
    i'm thinking....ok after the next Gibberling...after the next Scene.....blah, blah, blah. <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Someone stop the madness</strong></font> my Hard Drive is

    <small>Just got some hopefull news from &quot;Betrayer of Hope&quot; that Nukewinter.com
    have kicked up their own <a href="http://www.nukewinter.com/">review of Kings Quest MOE</a>.

    <small>Voodoo Magazine just slapped up this dirty little morsel on Everquest Beta that
    you'll be interested in. Playing for 4 months? <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Good Christ
    on a broomstick</strong></font>! 4 months of Everquest? Now I know there are some serious
    brown nosers out there.</small><font color="#C1C1FF" face="Arial"><strong> </strong></font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">EverQuest still proves to be one
      of the best things since spray cheese in a can and/or Buffy The Vampire Slayer. To
      clarify: yes, I have played EQ, I've been on for almost four months now. I'm not playing
      as much as I used to, which is a good thing 'cause I wasn't getting any work done. It
      looks like the game is going to ship a little bit later than previously expected, but you
      don't rush perfection. ASCII Dave and I went down to San Diego to visit with the team a
      little while ago to begin work on the Official EverQuest Player's Guide, which is turning
      out to be perhaps the second most daunting and exciting task I've ever undertaken (right
      after starting Voodoo). While we were there, we got to check out a very early
      implementation of the new 3D sound which will be added to the game in another month or so,
      as well as discuss some of the back history of Norrath and learn a little about some of
      the coming quests. So if you meet a barbarian warrior named Odinsson, cut him a litle
      slack and let him join your stupid party already, you tree-hugging hippy. </font></small></p>

    see the guys aren't wasting any time getting back to work. First he talks about the games
    Launcher and if it will be <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>similar to Ultima's of the past</strong></font>.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"><small>We have not finished
      the launcher, although we will start working on it in January. We will pass on more
      information soon.</small></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left"><small>Here he is again talking about what the staff will be like for
    Christams. Sounds pretty tame to me. I would get my pet Monkey collection and a few
    strippers and see what happens myself.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"><small>Good question. Peace
      on Earth? No more hunger? All the worlds problems solved? Actually, I'd would be happy if
      the fans keep supporting us, and staying excited about Ultima Ascension. ( a new dual
      Pentium 450 would also be nice).</small></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left"><small>On killable characters.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"><small>Right now the plan
      is to allow everyone to be killed. Yes, Lord British can be killed, but not by normal
      means....<br>
      <br>
      This is subject to change as we see what effect it has on the balance of the game.</small></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left"><small>Next he jumps on if there will be monkeys or any types of no
    monsters in the game.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"><small>Yes, there are
      animals in the game, although the player will not be able to ride them. As for how many, I
      don't want to spoil anything, but there are several different kinds!</small></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left"><small>A bit on the compass.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"><small>The compass sits in
      the lower left corner of the screen. It can be turned on, or off. Presently it can not be
      moved.<br>
      <br>
      The camera can be pitch locked.<br>
      <br>
      Placing the cursor over an object brings up a tool tip, so the name of objects can be
      found easily.</small></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left"><small>On the hot topic of the camera etc.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"><small>The player can lock
      the pitch of the camera. We do not have any plans for pre-assigned cameras, although that
      is a good idea.</small></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left"><small>How will Reagents be handled.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"><small>Reagents can be
      found or bought. Some will be more common then others, and much more difficult to find. As
      with previous Ultimas, the reagents needed for spells are related to the functions of the
      spell.</small></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left"><small>Clarifying his statement he made on Gamecenter.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"><small>Stonegate Tower is
      made up of 5 floors. What I should have said, was that each FLOOR teaches a different
      skill. All of the floors are on the same map, and movement is seemless between the floors.</small></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left"><small>Why things have been so quiet lately.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"><small>Thanks for all the
      support of all the fans, and everyone involved with this board. We are indeed taking time
      off for the holidays, and will be fully refreshed, and ready to get back to work in
      January. I hope everyone has a safe and wonderful holiday.</small></font></p>

    Review </a>for you to read by the fire, or by the heater etc. Hell I just get the Intern
    to keep me warm. Anyway, looks like everyone is willing to dish out better ratings for
    this game now. It's about time I say since AW <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>wouldn't even

    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">For the most part,
      The Second Age is the same game I played last year, with some minor modifications. The
      graphics haven't changed, and the only major addition to the interface is a chat function,
      based on the ichat system. If you have a character online, you can log on to any one of a
      number of chat &quot;conferences,&quot; which hold up to 300 players each. Most of these
      are password-protected channels, where guild members or groups of friends talk, but
      occasionally there is&nbsp; a conference that allows people in without a password. None of
      the conferences are particularly lively, though; the chat window isn't well-integrated
      into the game window, so you have to be in a safe spot if you want to stop and talk. </font></small></p>

    <small>CGO have done up their own <a href="http://www.cdmag.com/articles/016/083/return_krondor_review.html">Review of Return
    to Krondor.</a> If your looking for an incredibly linear game but with a strong story then
    get this. I am honstely surprised they took this route on RTK<font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>
    rather than open ended </strong></font>like the last one. </small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Boot up Return to
      Krondor and you can expect to give up sleep, food, and meaningful interactions in the real
      world for at least a few days (the game is so compelling that you tend to devour it in as
      few bites as possible, like a great thick novel). Return is a stunning return to form for
      the Krondor series, and bodes spectacularly well for any future installments in the
      on-going tale.</font></small></p>
