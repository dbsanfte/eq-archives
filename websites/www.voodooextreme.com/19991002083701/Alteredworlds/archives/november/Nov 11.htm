    <small>Lorien just got some more &quot;under the counter&quot; lovin from the boys working
    on Worlds of Fantasy. Which was temporarily dead but then had a slight pulse, then <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>someone did an ER George Clooney to it and brought it back from
    the dead.</strong></font> Here's a blatant rip from Gagames on a little update action
    going on.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">I would like to
      announce to the we at Games Galore have restarted active development of Worlds of Fantasy.
      Just last night we overcame our largest obstacle when we received word from Twilight 3D
      that the version of the 3Dge engine that we required was ready. The arrival of the engine
      means that we can begin to integrate our game code with a graphical interface. Hopefully,
      we will be able to deliver some screenshots to Gamer's Alliance in the short future. Even
      more importantly, this means that we are now very much on track to be able to make a
      presentation to any interested publishers. </font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">We have used this downtime to
      reorganize our code and now that we have restarted development I can say that this process
      was definitely worthwhile. Just through this process we have made great gains and
      improvements in our game code. I am very excited by what I am seeing out of this game. The
      features that I forsaw when we started this project are starting to come together
      especially in the guild support and dynamic world (the Referee Engine). </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">As always our bulletin board

    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Not to worry,
      although Ascension has a story driven plot, the player will have plenty of areas to

      through, and many non plot related quests.</font></small></p>

    <small>Loks like Jonric from VN cornered Feargus Erquhart in a a dark alley and made him
    speak or else. Yes, we Webmasters have to resort to any kinds of tactics to get info out

      far? </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Feargus: I have been pretty happy
      with what they have thought. I was a little dissappointed that we missed about 5 major
      things and 25 or so small/medium things, but with a game as complex as Fallout 2 I was
      also thankful. :) </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">I think the biggest thing we
      missed was the Load and Save game times which just never occured to us - since as we play
      the game we don't save and load that much. Ooops. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The major problems will be fixed

      <i><p></i><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">We continue to work 14-16
      hour days, seven days a week, both here at BioWare and down at Black Isle, trying to
      finish the game. What we're aiming this week is a FC, a final candidate. This isn't
      necessarily THE final candidate, rather it is a version of the game with all known bugs
      resolved that Black Isle and BioWare quality assurance can review in detail, and let us
      know what bugs they then find in the FC so we can fix these. We've still got work ahead of
      us, but we're finally starting to see the end of this three year tunnel now... </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">We reached a new milestone on the
      game over the weekend - we were down to 56 active bugs (out of some 6000 total dealt with
      to date). That number didn't stick unfortunately - it went up to just over 100 active bugs
      after we added in the bugs that were found at BioWare over the weekend. But, all bugs were
      assigned and fixed Monday and again we await the next bug report to see where things are
      at. The good thing about all of the bugs is that a lot of them are becoming harder and
      harder to actually see as bugs unless you know the game very well - that is, you wouldn't
      know that someone's dialogue is not working completely since it makes sense as it stands.
      This is why it's great having people playing the game who really know the way it's
      supposed to be, and the AD&amp;D rules - they are catching a lot of things that are
      increasingly more and more subtle. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">We're doing the multiplayer long
      distance checklist right now - making sure that we catch any areas where the multiplayer
      game functions differently from the single player game is a top priority - since we
      anticipate that a lot of people will be playing the game in multiplayer mode, or exporting
      characters back and forth between single and multiplayer games. The multiplayer games are
      increasingly more and more solid of late. But we continue to test the multiplayer
      checklist with each and every build. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Everyone here is pretty tired,
      but no one's complaining. Morale is quite high, and people are glad to see the game
      becoming more and more fun. It's a delight to play each new version of the game and see
      the bugs that had been on the bug list last time, now working... </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">We're now in what is, I'm told,
      the most difficult part of any project - the final finishing kick. The team at BioWare and
      Black Isle are all busting a hump to make sure that we're 100% happy with what goes out
      the door - everyone's doing a great job, and I feel very proud to be on the BG team. </font></small></p>

      and history for the game can be passed on in such a media, but we will not stop there. We

      plus some interesting stuff we have looked into that is being developed and would be in
      production by the time the game begins. Also there will be the &quot;secret&quot; weapons
      that the goverment always keeps under wraps. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Weapons can be gained in several

      1. Issued by the &quot;agency&quot;<br>

      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Some weapons will be comon place
      (i.e. 9mm pistol) but others will be difficult to get. The arms dealer has access to

      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Previously, we did not prioritize
      the pre-order product AS STRICTLY. Typically it would take about 2-3 days to produce all
      the product for the initial sell-in. We would produce the product and then start shipping
      it out. In some cases, other shipments went out before the pre-order product. Then the
      pre-order product would get to our fulfillment center (taking several days) and our
      fulfillment center would take a few days to start sending out orders, and then if you
      shipped it two day, it would take a few days, etc, etc. </font></small></p>

      actually OVERNIGHTED product from our production facility to their warehouse and had
      people fulfilling store orders the same night so that stores had it on Saturday when the
      product was produced on Wednesday. I think they did a great job! </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">So what we have done is shaken up
      our distribution system to get the pre-order process moving along much more quickly. We
      will send the pre-order product out first, probably before the rest of the first
      production run is even finished. Then we will use faster shipping to get it to the
      fulfillment center more quickly. Finally, we have the fulfillment center staffing up to
      guarantee a one-day turnaround on orders. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Note that we are not trying to
      BEAT EB to the market. I wish every retailer was as fast. But not everyone lives near an
      EB. Plus, some people like to know that the product is going to show up at their door
      without having to go out and search for it. Imagine if you knew an EB had the product and
      you had to wait for a weekend to get there and they had sold out? </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Eventually we want to get to a
      state of the art order fulfillment system where you can check, in real time, the status of
      your order. The second that sucker ships, you will receive a confirmation email stating
      that it is on the road. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">So it sounds like you are one of
      the folks that lives close to an EB, has a copy reserved with them, and will hop into a
      car the second the title arrives (kinda like me with Railroad Tycoon II this weekend).
      Also, doesn't sound like the Volo's Guide offer holds much appeal for you. Go with EB.
      Most likely you will save some money as well. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">My note was more to make sure
      people understood that we had changed our system (and will continue to improve it) versus
      make it sound like the end-all be-all solution. Whatever works best for everyone from a
      price/convenience/features standpoint, we want to make sure we have a good program to
      support... </font></small></p>

      criminals can be attacked without fear of retribution. If you keep attacking a robbing
      people (or murder someone) you will be branded as a major criminal. Major criminals can be
      permanently killed with no system retribution. Of course, if you attack a player somewhere

    <small>Gamesmania have kicked up a nice <a href="http://gamesmania.com/english/reviews/new/fallout2/fallout2.htm">Review of Fallout 2
    </a>that should make for an interesting read. I'm getting a lot of good feedback on this

    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">That's Fallout 2's
      big selling point--some slight improvements here and there, and a lot more of what made
      the original work. Much of the motifs and gameplay of Fallout are unchanged, and anyone
      who's played the first game will eagerly sink into the second with nary a glance at the
      manual. The major new frills, many of which were prompted by gamer feedback, add new
      dimensions to gameplay. And although they add a fun new component to Fallout 2, I do think
      they could still use a little polishing. </font></small></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Combat in Return to
      Krondor is turn-based using the Initiative attribute. Unlike its predecessor, however, it
      does not take place on a separate screen. &quot;When you're in combat, you really get into
      it,&quot; says PyroTechnix Studio Manager Sinjin Bain. &quot;Even though we maintained the
      turn-based structure which everyone who has seen it really likes, after you choose your
      tactic for the round, the action is carried out in real-time for that turn.&quot; Ranged
      attacks using bows and arrows require line of sight. </font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The combat experience is also
      enhanced by many of the game's 25,000 frames of motion capture, and spells make effective
      use of the True3D engine's real-time lighting capabilities. According to Bain, &quot;The
      bottom line is we've added cutting edge action and graphics to a classic turn-based RPG
      system. The feedback has been very positive.&quot;</font></small></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0"><small>I'm going to post this here
      because we won't have all the fancy buttons and stuff up on the home page until tomorrow.<br>
      <br>
      Here is our pre-order program. Note that this affects you if you already placed a
      pre-order for Baldur's Gate with Interplay - you will get this for free.<br>
      <br>
      First a statement about delivery prioritization:<br>
      <br>
      All our pre-orders take top priority for order fulfillment. With Baldur's Gate, the day we
      produce the game we will aggregate our total number of preorders, add on a safety factor
      for additional sales and pull that many units off the production line BEFORE ANY OTHER
      PRODUCT FOR ANY OTHER PURPOSE. (Yes, even before the product for the Marketing group at
      Black Isle ;) ) This 'priority' product will be expressed shipped to our fulfillment
      center (Digital River in Minneapolis) where it will be reshipped (with one day turnaround)
      to you depending upon your shipping instructions. Our target is to get you the product no
      later than it shows up in the first store in your area. In many cases you will receive it
      BEFORE it is available elsewhere.<br>
      <br>
      Now our special offer:<br>
      <br>
      All Interplay pre-orders will be accompanied by a free copy of &quot;Volo's Guide to the
      Sword Coast&quot;. This is an official game accessory for the Forgotten Realms campaign
      setting for the game of Advanced Dungeons and Dragons. &quot;Volo's Guide to the Sword
      Coast&quot; covers much of the area that is found in Baldur's Gate, and the content is
      consistent -- locations that are described in one are found in the other. The book is an
      oversized paperback with color cover and 240 pages (with many illustrations and maps for
      you non-reading types). It is also out of print - we have obtained all remaining copies to
      use in this program.<br>
      <br>
      If this sounds like something you might be interested in, check out our pre-order site at
      www.interplay-store.com. We don't have a mention of the program at the store yet, but
      don't worry ALL ORDERS WILL INCLUDE VOLO'S GUIDE. We will have official banners and book
      art up on the Baldur's Gate home page and the Interplay sales site in the next couple of
      days.<br>
      <br>
      Oh... and Baldur's Gate will be shipping Fall '98. </small></font></p>
