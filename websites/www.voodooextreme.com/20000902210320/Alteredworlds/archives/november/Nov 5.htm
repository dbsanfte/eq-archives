    <small>Yup, it is about that time when Sacrates gets the hankering to spew a bit. Mostly
    good comments really. Just downloaded the Tomb Raider 3 demo and damn the water looks
    special. I am fairly impressed how<font color="#FFFFFF"><strong> they really did a
    rogering to this &quot;Aging&quot; engine and kicked it in the monkey business</strong></font>.
    My head is spinning from all of these games actually. Recent titles I had to dish out for
    are Sin, Shogo, and Trespasser. Shogo of those 3 really does a bitch slappin to the
    others. </small><br>
    <small>Damn solid game. Of the demos I have gotten that make me want to dish out the dough
    would be Heretic 2, Blood 2, and Populous. All 3 being sequals also. Plus rumors are
    flying around that Half Life and Baldur's Gate &quot;May&quot; get kicked back to
    December. (You didn't hear that from me) Damn I say. Half Life is going to<font color="#FFFFFF"><strong> lay waste to the entire landscape of games </strong></font>out
    there. Oh well, better than getting a buggy ass game. </small><br>
    <small>Although that may mean no Team Fortress 2 until after X mas! Anyway, for those
    looking for a solid game right now and don't want to wait, get Shogo. Even RPG fans will
    enjoy this beauty with it's great storyline and anime theme. Enough spew...hopefully i've
    enlightened you a bit on buying decisions.</small></p>

    <small>Looks like Sinjin (Cool name points) got a little feisty (No pun intended) with his
    fingers and spit out <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>one mother of a post</strong></font>.
    Pretty much he covers all the bases here so go ahead, read on.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">1. Yes, there is all kind of
      unique and cool inventory items / weapons / potions in the game. There are over 400
      inventory items alone. Some magic, some not, but all pretty cool. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">2. There are two lock picking
      modes, one is just a dice rool for those who don't like (or don't have the dexterity)
      manually picking them. There are 27 different combinations of trapped locks, some poison,
      some bladed, etc. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">3. The wilderness areas are
      unique so there are plains areas, mountains, canyons, woods, etc. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">4. Gold coins that get changed
      automatically into gems in certain increments to lighten your load as you accumulate
      wealth. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">5. Mainly personal inventory.
      There are one or two other ways, but I'm not going to tell. We'll see who figues it out.
      Maybe I'll tell down the road a bit. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">6. Important conversations are
      logged in a journal and can be played at any time for any given chapter. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">7. Tehre is some interaction with
      the 2D portions and the 3D objects sometimes you can pick them out and sometimes not. Our
      goal was to integrate the look as much as possible, this is where the real time lighting
      really came into play. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">8. The combats are varied in size
      and formation. We tried to present the player with really different scenarios. Yes, there
      are some dragons... they do have to fit on the screen, right? </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">9. The game will succeed or fail
      on merit, not on hype. We have tried to make the game engaging and challenging. If we have
      done that sales will take care of themselves. All that being said, PC Gamer had almost 20
      pages of coverage in the Oct. issue. The marketing guys put in prequels written by Ray in
      several magazines, huge maps/posters in CGW and PCGamer. We've done quite a lot actually.
      The other thing you have to remember is that Sierra Studios just released Caesar III and
      is releasing Half-Life, Mask, and RtK all for Thanksgiving so there is an incredible
      number of AAA offerings by Sierra Studios this holiday season. Some entire companies don't
      have this lineup, we're just one of the Sierra brand divisions! </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">10. We have tried to make the
      first chapter accessible and fun! Let us know how we did. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Now, I must rest my fingers. </font></small></p>

    <small>Even more action happening over on the BG Boards for you guys to see. Greg was

    </small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">You can cancel a spell at any
      time before 'casting' by R-clicking the mouse button.<br>
      <br>
      For example, you decide to launch a fireball.<br>
      <br>
      You click on the 'cast spell' icon, click on the 'Fireball' spell icon and up comes a
      targeting cursor. You notice that your thief is too close, and would get fried in the
      explosion. You R-click to cancel the spell, and choose 'Magic Missile' instead. You do NOT
      lose the Fireball spell.</font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>Greg was also over in the backroom and had this to say about manuals etc. Here
    is a<a href="http://www.interplay.com/bgate/mb3.html"> link </a>to the specific post if
    you want to add to it also.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Just got back from a meeting with
      the President of Interplay where we approved all the final build materials and costs for
      Baldur's Gate. We spent some time talking about the cost of the game (5 CD's) and whether
      we REALLY needed such a big manual. He was wondering whether the state of the art with
      pull-down help, tip screens, online electronic manuals, etc, would work instead (for
      future products - don't anyone panic, he approved everything for BG).<br>
      <br>
      So my question for you all... for future products would there be some combination of
      online/electronic help/manuals that we could do that people feel would be good enough to
      REPLACE the current paper manual?<br>
      <br>
      I personally LIKE nice high-quality manuals and save them... but do I actually buy games
      because of the manuals? Would I enjoy Baldur's Gate or another RPG just as much with a
      nice glossy command card and no other materials? I'm not sure... I know for UO I ended up
      printing out the whole web site, but that might have been different due to the fact that
      it was an online game... or was it?<br>
      <br>
      Let me know what you think... this is for future work and I'm just curious. Please post
      rationale, if possible, and not just opinions.</font></small></p>

    that I noticed. First up is Bill talking about Hardware excelleration.</small></p>
    <i><blockquote>
      <p></i><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"><small>I'll try to answer this as
      best as I can. First, a P233 should run the game fine, if you have enough RAM and a fast
      3D accelerator. &quot;Enough RAM&quot; means 64MB recommended, but 32MB will probably be
      playable with some pauses. We've found that the more RAM, the better, so 128MB systems
      actually play faster than 64MB systems.<br>
      <br>
      Exactly which models constitute a &quot;fast enough&quot; 3D accelerator has yet to be
      determined--our Direct3D support isn't far enough along for us to be able to <i>tell yet.</small></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p></i><small>Next is Bill talking Sounds etc.</small><i></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p></i><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Voodoo Rush will be
      supported.<br>
      <br>
      Sound on the Awe32 should sound Awesome! (Pardon the pun!)</font></small><i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p></i><small>And finally here he is again talking about conversation and dialogue in the
    game.</small><i></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p></i><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">1: Yes, conversations operate
      much like scripted sequences, although you choose what the Avatar's responses are. The
      characters perform some physical acting along with the voice acting.<br>
      <br>
      2: While the Avatar is speaking, you won't be able to necessarily control him--however,
      these situations won't last long, duration-wise.<br>
      <br>
      3: We were planning too, but cut it because of time constraints.</font></small></p>

    <small>Thanks to <a href="http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Fortress/9854/">ARGNet</a>
    for these little news sausages. Couple of interesting things&nbsp; posted by Janus
    Anderson. Good lord <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>we still have a long wait for this game</strong></font>
    though! Although it will be interesting watching this game evolve. The first one is from
    Janus talking about Player run Housing etc.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">One of our goals is to implement
      a guild system that will support special abilities that the members pay upkeep for. To
      qualify, however, you will have to use the name 'House' instead of 'Guild'. We believe
      that the word 'House' is more appropriate than 'Guild', since our system is broken up into
      smaller 'Families'. Although anyone can have a minor house (with all the support that you
      would expect for a guild), there will be a fixed number of 'Major Houses'. Major houses
      will be unique in the fact that, for a substantial gold upkeep each month, members will be
      awarded unique and special abilities (such as a swordsmanship bonus for the fighters'
      guild etc.)and a direct link from our main website. You may want to convince the guilds
      joining your association to change their name in advance if they wish to be considered!</font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">When we get around to accepting
      applications for 'major houses', we will not make any requirements for the naming of such
      as long as it is in the RP spirit. We will not, of course, accept names such as 'the PK
      Masters' for major houses, although people can name minor houses anything they wish. We
      would, however, appreciate it if people would use the term 'house' in some large scale
      guild titles, since we are trying to set up an association between small groups (families,
      orders, or cults)uniting for a broader cause, rather than focusing on individual
      associations as much. To clarify a bit, a 'family' has a similar structure to a 'house'
      except it is designed on a much smaller scale and oriented to people who wish to RP the
      social aspects of getting married, adopting children and such. I would love to elaborate
      on the system but I'm still under orders to withold some of the juicy-bits for press
      releases.</font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">For consideration as a major
      house, we will require an appropriate title, creed, and history as well as a set of laws
      and purposes that the house members strictly adhere to. Since we will award special
      abilities, specially dyed guild tabards, and web links to those limited few who are
      selected, and we will require the house members to adhere to the laws and purposes
      designated. Failure to comply could ultimately result in the loss of major house status,
      since the basic purpose of the major house structure is to further role-playing in
      Middle-earth.</font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>Also coming from the mouth, or should I say Fingers, of Janus is this little bit
    on making your own midi's.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Interestingly enough, the ability
      to construct and play your own midi files(even in synch with other players) was written in
      the design documents at the beginning of this project. One of our programmers has already
      written a simple midi-language parser (using note letters and numbers to represent
      duration) that can be used to construct and play simple music. I'll probably even add some
      code that will detune and/or change durations of notes for those players who are lacking
      skill =)</font></small></p>

      nice, actually.</font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left"><small>Next he talks about an Australian release for the Kangaroo lovin
    chimps down there.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Best answer I have right now is,
      I don't know. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">I believe it's going to ship from
      the US at the same time as the US release, which is within a week or two. But that's up to
      Cendant software, and they haven't told me yet. If they decide to release it from the UK,
      then you'll see it first quarter next year. </font></small></p>

      publicly. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">I will say, however, in a general
      way, that the name &quot;Krondor&quot; on a product will mean something, something unique.
      If we can't do something both better and different than the competition, we won't.</font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>After being complimented on his work. A very tame response here. Hell, I would
    have been all over that with some thing like &quot;Damn straight, my books <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>go straight to the nads and don't let go.</strong></font>&quot;.</small></p>

    <p><small>This time it's Janus Anderson talking about World size.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">How did you get this calculation?
      The 'virtual size' of the world would entirely depend on your monitor size! Rest assured,
      Middle-earth is quite vast in scope, approximately 180,000 'screens' of information not
      including building interiors and dungeons. This is approximately 424 screens on a side.
      Even if it took you just 5 seconds to cross a 'screen' at full speed, it would still take
      you 35 minutes to cross the map if you were completely uninterrupted and ran in a straight
      line. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">We could theoretically make the
      world even larger, but at a certain point the size of the world inhibits gameplay since

      something more interesting! </font></small></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The combat isn't
      going to be arcade like, we shall see about that. Pretty much all combat interfaces,
      unless they are strategy games or turned based, are arcade like. You find your target and
      you keep clicking on it or attacking it until it is dead. Everynow and they you side-step
      to avoid a blow, but then you go back to clicking. One of the reasosn Diablo did so well
      was the combat was easy to do. Even if you make it where only a certain weapon will hit a
      specific creature you still have to do the clicking on the creature. I don't think they
      are gonna make the combat where you click on the creature you want to attack and your
      character goes off and fights on his own.</font></small></p>

    <i><blockquote>
      <p></i><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Just got finished reading the
      latest installment. Another group of fine questions too. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Richard comments on how they are
      setting up the stat generation routines within U:A by using the Gypsy routine again. He
      goes on further to state: </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">&quot;But one of the things we
      debate internally is how to deal with people &quot;figuring out&quot; the system, and
      realizing, as they will, that if they answer all of the questions emphasizing the Valor
      virtue, they'll have more strength. Essentially they don't answer the questions the way
      they really want to, and instead answer them in a way which allows them to customize their
      characters' attributes, which I would prefer to avoid. So we're debating how to make those
      sort of psychological profile questions meaningful in the game, and yet discourage players
      from dishonestly answering the questions in order to customize their characters.&quot; </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">I do not see a problem with
      people &quot;figuring out&quot; the systems. This is a game and people will want to assume
      certain roles that they enjoy and not be saddled with something they didn't want to do. If
      I wish to try the game with emphasis as a warrior then I want to know what the best way to
      achieve this is, the same for trying it with emphasis on magic, etc. By limiting the
      player on how they can choose it, the re-playability of the game will go down
      dramatically. If the questions are too deep and convoluted then players will be confused
      about choices and frustration could start.</font></small></p>

    <small>Noticed over at VN that Rob Fermier made quite a few <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>comments
    on System Shock on the Boards </strong></font>and in Usenet. For the complete package run
    your ass over to <a href="http://www.vaultnetwork.com">VN</a> and read up on it, otherwise
    here's the first half of his Usenet speech/comments etc.</small></p>
    <i><blockquote>
      <p></i><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Warning: pointy-heading game
      philosophy &amp; semantics spew ahead. You've been warned. :-) Apologies in advance if I
      sound overly argumentative, that's just the old high school debate reflexes kicking in --
      I definitely appreciate that you (and probably many lurkers as well) are concerned about
      us screwing up a great game, and we take those concerns very seriously. That said, on to
      why I think RPG elements do not portend the trouble you are expecting... </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">In every game your avatar in the
      game world has certain limitations and abilities that are imposed by the simulation. The
      player never controls 100% of the activities. In Shock, you decide to run down the
      corridor, but the simulation imposes constraints on how fast you run and how fast you
      turn. You may decide to shoot, but the game imposes limitations on rate of fire, kickback,
      inaccuracy, and so on. This is certainly true of the original System Shock. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The biggest difference between
      Shock and Shock 2 is that those capabilities, rather than being fixed, are also part of
      the larger simulation. So in the original Shock, you're be able to run at one speed,
      period. In Shock 2, your running speed is determined by (among other things) your agility
      stat. Is the act of running any more or less simulation based or out of the player's
      control in those cases? I don't think so. In fact, in the &quot;RPG&quot; case, you have
      MORE control because you as the player have made the decision of whether to get that point
      of agility or improve your hacking skill, and so forth. This same logic applies to the
      player's maximum health, falling distance, radiation resistance, weapons ability, and the
      like. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Is it &quot;unrealistic&quot;
      that your physical and mental characteristics improve considerably over the course of the
      game, which is a relatively short time frame by real world standards? Of course. Is it any
      more of a realism problem than the ability to carry piles of weapons and equipment, take
      near-lethal damage and recover just by using chemicals, and alter reality by save/load? I
      don't think so. I definitely think it's worth it for the interesting gameplay decisions
      that come out of shaping your character's development and really bringing a lot of these
      factors into the simulation and having them be dynamic over the course of the game. We
      could come up with some thin fictional explanation for why you change so rapidly, but
      would there be any point? </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The purpose of this game system,
      like any other, is that it adds value to the game, not that it is an integral part of a
      realistic simulation. To be ludicrous, we could simulate your need to sleep or go to the
      bathroom -- that would be realistic, but not fun. So, we don't do it. Having the player's
      characteristics alter the simulation is the reverse; it's not that realistic, but it is
      fun. So, we put it in. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">A more dramatic impact of
      RPG-esque elements onto System Shock 2 is the addition of &quot;mini-simulations&quot;
      that aren't a part of the main 3D world. When you go to repair a weapon, there is a fairly
      abstract separate simulation of repairing it, taking into account your skills, equipment,
      resources, and so forth. There is no separate mini-game for the player (as opposed to the
      character) to excel at and be a better repair-er. That's just not what the game is about
      -- it's about terrifying atmosphere, rich story and setting, exploration, and combat. By
      keeping the simulation of repairing, hacking, weapons modification, and so on fairly
      abstract, it lets us have more of those systems, and also lets us have those systems
      unfold more carefully over the course of the game.</font></small></p>

      to the Forgotten Realms setting. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">BioWare's Infinity Engine is the
      closest, most faithful transliteration of the AD&amp;D rules that is possible with current
      technology. That sounds like a hedge, but I mean it as very high praise. A handful of
      things had to be changed, but in those few cases the spirit and balance of the game has
      been preserved. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">But it is, after all, the
      Forgotten Realms setting that's going to sell this game. And the setting _is_ as good as
      it looks on the screenshots and previews. The level of detail is just amazing, from the
      lush game screens to spell effects. There's also a very nice touch with the equipment
      screens, where a right click brings up a hand-drawn illo of the weapon/gem/tool along with
      a handy description. It's as though every time you've said &quot;If I made a D&amp;D
      computer game, I'd include X&quot; they wrote it down, and incorporated it. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">So yes, it's true to the AD&amp;D

    <small>It's been a while, but Stephen Nichols was back on the all new Middle Earth Dev
    Board and<font color="#FFFFFF"><strong> had a few sparkly things to say</strong></font> on
    permanent death in ME.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Permanent death relies on a few
      design ideas that still need to be realized: </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">1) The player power curve needs
      to be realistic. We can't have single players that can take out 10 opponents without a
      scratch. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">2) There needs to be an enforced
      waiting period before you gain the ability to permanently kill another player. We're
      currently thinking about 1 month's worth of play time for the character before enabling
      the murdering option. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">3) To kill a player, you must
      have disabled ALL opponents. After ALL opponents are disabled (or have fled), you can take
      out the unconscious folks. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">4) The civilized game world must
      react negatively<br>
      when you murder someone. Shopkeepers should call guards, sherrifs should want your head.
      Of course, if you leave the area in which you have murdered, you'll be out of harms way.
      Guards should be believeable... not teleporting instant killers. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">5) Pulling the plug during a
      battle should have NO effect. The AI system will take over such characters and allow them
      to continue fighting. Of course, if you log back in while the battle is in progress, you
      should be able to resume. This should allow your buddies to guard your AI controlled body
      in the event of a network failure. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">All of these options should help
      to make permanent death feasible. </font></small></p>
