    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Haha...<br>
      <br>
      No, not trying to 'dupe' anyone or anything... just trying to do what fans asked us to...<br>
      <br>
      Many of you have not been on the Fallout2 boards or were fortunate enough (or unfortunate
      enough) to make it to the Fallout2 launch party. It was a LOT of fun, both for us, and for
      the fans that made it.<br>
      <br>
      However, the overall feedback we got from Fallout2 fans around the world was that they
      didn't like the fact that they had to fly out to California to be at the party. People
      were asking for 'satellite' parties around the country (and in Canada, Europe, Australia,
      Japan)<br>
      <br>
      So this is the closest thing we could come up with. We can't be EVERYWHERE at the same
      time, but we thought that some stores and fans would enjoy getting together for the
      release of the game - you know, meet people in your community that you might want to game
      with, that sort of thing.<br>
      <br>
      So no, it is not some evil conspiracy to corrupt the souls of American youths... and NO we
      are certainly NOT delaying anything on the game for this. We just though it would be a
      cool thing... Whatzamatter? Don't want a free mousepad? </font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left"><small>And then we've got this bit on the Final Release candidate.
    Basically this is about it, the other posts were small.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">We have to walk a fine line
      between total secrecy and total disclosure (because we are now a public company). We
      cannot make 'forward-looking' statements that people could construe to mean one thing, and
      end up meaning something else. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Now we all know that a Final
      Candidate is a good thing. However, we also know (or should know) that there is a big
      difference between a Final Candidate and a shrink-wrapped box sitting on a retail shelf.
      The Final Candidate can have all sorts of issues that need to be resolved, etc.
      Personally, I would love to be able to let people know as we move through every step in
      the process... my concern is that, on the off-chance we hit a bump in the road, people
      will start screaming &quot;you SOB's said you had the Final Candidate done in early
      November!!&quot; (Of course, these are usually the people who know the LEAST about the
      entertainment software industry, but at that point it really doesn't matter) </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Note that this is the single
      biggest reason why most game companies have stopped talking to their fans during the
      development process.</font></small></p>

    say what everyone else says so eloquently: <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Fallout, but
    bigger.</strong></font> Head on over and check it out.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">This is still a
      must-have for fans of combat-heavy RPGs. Fallout 2 is built around the time-honored motto
      of this sort of game: Travel to fascinating places. Meet interesting people. Kill them.
      Take their stuff. Repeat as necessary. It executes this formula exceedingly well. It's
      unfortunate that the game as shipped is marred by bugs and problems, but it's still great
      fun. It will be even better once Black Isle Studios and Interplay run it through quality
      assurance one more time. So grab your Pip Boy, smack a magazine into that FAL, and get
      ready to rock the wasteland. Just be sure you're prepared for some bumps in the desert as
      you push your Highwayman towards the sunset. </font></small></p>

    pre-ordering U:A. First is a bit from Yos on NPC AI...</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">We use both AI and scripting to
      create creature and NPC behavior in our game. Most creatures and NPC's have specific AI
      based on certain needs or percived threats (i.e. mice will go after cheese and monsters
      will automatically attack creatures that are unlike themselves), but we have a very
      powerful scripting system that allows us to give specific characters and creatures
      specific behaviors and actions. So, when you play Ascension, you will encounter creatures
      that are operating on basic motivations and you will encounter tightly scripted scenarios
      where creatures have unique actions.</font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>Then Seth on items in hand, specifically torches...</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Our present plan is to have
      shields and torches shown in the Avatar's hands. We are still working on this, so exactly

      <br>
      Using items (other then weapons) as weapons, is something we are discussing.</font></small></p>

    <p><small>and U:A Pre-orders :)... </small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">There seems to be a lot of
      interest in doing a preorder. This is more of a Sales &amp; Marketing issue, but we will
      be sure to let them know we think it's a great idea. We should have more info on this in
      the next month or so.</font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>and finally on combat... </small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Combat is something that is being
      worked on as we speak. I don't want to get into it until we are finished. I will say that
      combat is in real time, although it will be more strategic, then arcade. We are working
      hard to make combat exciting for all types of players.<br>

      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The answer: &quot;Making cool

      can have their own mini BG launch parties. HOWEVER, these parties HAVE to be affiliated
      with a retail store. We will be sending out the specifics of the program to stores
      shortly, but if you have friends that work in/for a computer store, and they want to host
      a launch party, send me an email and we will send them a party kit with a PILE of goodies

      Release dates are always estimates. They aren't there to mislead the public. Its when a

    to be taken from the final day before the Phase 3 beta wipe. Here's some lubed thumbnails
    for your enjoyment...</small></p>

    <small>If you dig on Wizardry, this should get you feeling <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>all
    warm and fuzzy in all the right places</strong></font>. Looks like Interplay is set to
    release the Ultimate Wizardry Archives. If you haven't checked out the Wizardry universe,
    or if you'd love to go back and see what the old games look like on a PII, this could just
    make your day. Every installment in the series is included, Wizardry I-VII, as well as
    Wizardry Gold, which is really just VII with a graphical face lift.</small></p>

    <small>I really gotta check out the demo of this puppy, since <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>everyone
    and their pet goblin</strong></font> is talking about it. The guys over at <a href="http://www.cdmag.com/Home/">Computer Games Online</a> have tossed up a review of
    Monolith Production's Rages of Mages. It's a good little <a href="javascript:top.siteNAV.Click('rpg','N','/articles/015/104/rage_mages_review.html');">review</a>,
    although it doesn't seem to cut the game down for out of date graphics like many of the
    others I've seen.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">With the reemergence
      of the role-playing game (RPG) and the continued popularity of real-time strategy (RTS),
      it's not surprising that a game has merged those two gameplay elements. However, unlike
      the recent strategy and 3D action hybrids, games blending RPG and RTS feel integrated and
      whole, as both game types lend themselves to thoughtful play.<br>
      <br>
      While unlikely to satisfy hardcore fans of either genre, <i>Rage of Mages</i> is a fairly
      high-quality synergy of the two genres; in fact, it's an almost perfect split down the
      middle. Take the stats, character building, treasure hoarding, and fantasy setting most
      RPGs and combine it with the style of combat and interface of most RTS games, and you'll
      know what you're in for.</font></small></p>
