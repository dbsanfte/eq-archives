      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">I have raved about
      the incredible graphics of this game. I think from the screenshots they pretty much speak
      for themselves. I viewed this game in both 16 bit and 32 bit color. I couldn't tell much
      difference, but then again, I don't have the best video card on the market. I did run into
      large font problems in the subtitle box when I used 32 bit color. I wasn't able to correct
      the problem. Because the game has real-time dynamic colored lighting with shadow-effects
      and an atmospheric diffusion filtering technology, any of the newer video cards out today
      are going to give the player a real treat. Funcom is supporting most 3D accelerators
      including Voodoo &amp; Voodoo 2. TLJ balances motion capture animation and 2D/3D high
      resolution graphics without making the player feel like they are just watching a movie.
      You are in the movie! I managed to capture eight screenshots from the demo myself. Let's
      move on to page two and take a peek at them.</font></small></p>

      were a few spots where the player was sort of left dangling, but that's why we playtest
      this thing from beginning to end. James and Co. are busy adding more clues and hints and
      moving important characters so that they are easier to find. We also have a couple of
      people, who haven't read anything about the story, working their way through the game.
      They will be giving us the final feedback on the story cohesion. </font></small></p>

      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">On Sound Effects: We
      are finally getting around to the last data entry tasks. Don is currently doing a sweep
      through all of the areas and is placing the ambient sounds.<br>
      <br>
      Wow, what a difference this makes. It literally makes the areas come alive. I have
      honestly have never seen (or should that be heard) a game that has quite this many sounds
      in it. There are over a hundred sounds just for the spell effects alone, and each major
      type of monster has it's own walking sounds. If you hear a deep, slow thumping sound, run.<br>
      <br>
      Trust me on this. I think it's going to top off around 1400 distinct sounds, not including
      the voice over stuff. <br>
      <br>
      One thing to note if you have 32 megs or more of RAM, then you will get longer, more
      detailed versions on the ambient sounds. It has been been a constant balancing act between
      the need for a 16 meg version and the sound team's desire for a richer sound bed. Even
      with the sound compression techniques that we use, we could only fit so much into memory.
      The solution: we made two versions of the really long sounds. If you have 16 megs, then
      you will get a good ambient background with lots of localized sounds. If you have 32 megs,
      you will get truely amazing ambient sounds with extra localized sounds like music outside
      the taverns and echoing water sounds in the underground lake chamber. Oops, there is no
      underground lake, honest. :)<br>
      <br>
      Sooooooo, I would recommend that if you only have 16 megs of ram, you should consider
      upgrading for the sound effects alone. </font></small></p>

      We have the majority of the framework for the game built and are nearing the point where
      the real meat can be added (you know, combat systems and the like). As you know, our
      planned beta is this time next year, and we won't ship the product until it's been in beta

      possible and to make that world fun and easy to use. Like it or not, global chat serves
      the second purpose nicely. I agree with the realism argument. Global chat is not
      realistic. However, you don't have to use it if you don't want to. We're also providing an
      in-game mail system that allows you to send mail messages instantly to any other player on
      your server. That's not realistic either, but it's a necessary feature in my opinion.
      Sure, people can just use ICQ and their standard internet mail. But if players have to
      rely on outside sources to accomplish things in our game, we've failed on ease of use. If
      you don't want to partake in global chat, don't. It won't affect your play in any way. </font></small></p>

    <b><i><blockquote>
      <p align="left"></i></b><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">on the
      difficulty getting started in System Shock 1: Glad to hear that you enjoyed it. You are
      dead on the money that it limited its own success by being rather impenetrable to the
      casual user. I like to think we've learned our lesson and that Shock 2 will have an easier
      learning curve withough losing any of the powerful expression of the interface. </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">on the interface:
      Currently leaning is only handled through the keyboard, and while you will certainly be
      able to remap what keys control it, there aren't any plans for having leaning on the
      mouse. The same holds for crouching. A lean / crouch analog mode is an interesting one,
      we'll have to toss it around the team. As for the interface proper, mouselook is
      definitely supported, and is a major part of the default interface mode. </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">However, there is no
      need for circle-strafing and similar shooter techniques; it's there because we on the team
      found it a great way to wander around and really take in the &quot;3d ness&quot; of an
      area. The vibe of combat is definitely paced like the original -- deciding what to use on
      what monster, juggling ammo types and energy is a vital part of the game. Of course, in
      System Shock 2 you have even more axes to tweak around if you want --weapons settings, psi
      powers, and cyber implants all are part of the picture as well! </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">Although we haven't
      finalized all the parameters of what will be customizable to what, those of you who prefer
      the original System Shock interface should be able to customize back pretty closely to
      that. The one big thing that we aren't intending to support is the different movement
      cursors, and moving based on clicking on the screen. Movement is primarily handled through
      keyboard (defaulting to the WADX cluster), and we may support a &quot;move forward&quot;
      type interface in mouselook as well (no decision has been made yet). </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">on the official
      site: The &quot;official&quot; Shock 2 website should be going up sometime next week,
      barring unforseen problems. If you want a little tidbit in the meantime to tide you over,
      check out www.irrational-games.com, which has some new content on it's Shock 2 page.</font></small></p>

    <i><blockquote>
      <p align="left"></i><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">Sorry about not
      having an update for the past few days. I've been sick and we've been trying to get the
      game done. Also, our internet provider got their pipe to the internet cut in half by a
      Back-Ho (however that is spelled) yesterday morning. </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">Anyway, a quick
      update is that all of the quests are in and working. We are going through all the end game
      stuff to make sure that is working and doing some last minute tweaking. </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">We just got the
      audio for the new intro movie ending that we decided to do about Thursday night. The Intro
      movie was cool, but we just felt that the last part of it wasn't in line with the rest of
      it - so it was changed. One of the Stonekeep 2 artists jumped in and helped fix it
      Thursday night. It went off to the audio guy for sound effects on Friday, the sound
      effects came back (through a different internet provider) on Saturday and our Audio
      Director worked on the movie and got the soundtrack done at 2:49pm today. </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">Other than that we
      are balancing and making sure the car shows up where it is supposed to. There is a big
      problem with the car because it has to keep inventory and change maps - something the
      engine doesn't like to do except for the player and partymembers. So in a moment of genius
      we made the trunk a partymember - but that cause a crapload of problems. </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">We've fixed some
      crash problems with some of the party members, and the game is VERY stable right now. </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">We also modified
      some of the to-hit stuff in the past week, so you'll all have to improve your Small Guns a
      little more than the 120 to get all the Eye and Head criticals you got in Fallout 1. </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">And the programming
      team in a fit of hyper-programming fixed about 30 medium/major bugs in the past few days.
      They are pretty much working on little stuff right now. </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">All and all the team
      is really kicking ass, and getting a lot of stuff done. The game is looking really good
      and we've polished off most of the bugs. We don't have the bug count of Baldur's Gate, but
      of the over 3700 bugs found on the bug list we should have less than 50 still in the game.
      </font></small></p>

    <small>Yes, we have archived for your viewing pleasure. Your load times should be much
    better than a pair of Porn stars and chipmunks on the Dumbo ride at Disney World.
    Ahem...anyway, back to the news.</small><font color="#C1C1FF" face="Arial"><strong> </strong></font></p>

    <small>Even more Baldur's Gate happiness is being spread over on the message boards. It's
    like some kind of medevil orgy over there or somethin? Anyway Scott Greig was back again
    for more lovin and coughed up these bits for you and me.</small></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0"><small>We are finally
      getting around to the last data entry tasks. Don is currently doing a sweep through all of
      the areas and is placing the ambient sounds. </small></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0"><small>Wow, what a
      difference this makes. It litterally makes the areas come alive. I have honestly have
      never seen (or should that be heard) a game that has quite this many sounds in it. There
      are over a hundred sounds just for the spell effects alone, and each major type of monster
      has it's own walking sounds. If you hear a deep slow thumping sound, run. Trust me on
      this. I think it's going to top off around 1400 distinct sounds, not including the voice
      over stuff. </small></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0"><small>One thing to note if
      you have 32megs or more of RAM, then you will get longer, more detailed versions on the
      ambient sounds. It has been been a constant ballancing act between the need for a 16 meg
      version and the sound team's desire for a richer sound bed. Even with the sound
      compression techiniques that we use, we could only fit so much into memory. The solution:
      we made two versions of the really long sounds. If you have 16 megs, then you will get a
      good amibient background with lots of localized sounds. If you have 32 megs, you will get
      truely amazing ambient sounds with extra localized sounds like music outside the taverns
      and echoing water sounds in the underground lake chamber. Opps, there is no underground
      lake, honest. :) </small></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0"><small>Sooooooo, I would
      recomend that if you only have 16 megs of ram, you should consider upgrading for the sound
      effects alone. </small></font></i></p>
      <i><p><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">From all accounts it held up
      pretty good. There were a few spots where the player was sort of left dangling, but that's
      why we playtest this thing from beginning to end. James and Co. are busy adding more clues
      and hints and moving important characters so that they are easier to find. We also have a
      couple of people, who haven't read anything about the story, working their way through the
      game. They will be giving us the final feedback on the story cohesion. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">P.S. You might be wondering what
      Ben and Ross are doing now that they have finished playing through BG? They are playing
      through again multiplayer!! </font></small></i></p>
