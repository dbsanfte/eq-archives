    <small>Yeah I know it, Baldur's Gate is <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>not exactly a romp
    through the proverbial Frey.</strong></font> This is no Diablo that's for sure. Actually
    when you come right down to it, Baldur's Gate is pretty damn tough. With those words of
    wisdom I am going to toss a few tips your way if your having any probs. Just a few goodies
    for ya.</small><br>
    <small>1. Learn to live on the Space Bar and pause the game in combat. This is absolutely
    essential as you can't handle combat like Diablo and just jump in. Otherwise your gonna
    get an ass kicking like you've never gotten before. Not to mention reloading the game
    every few minutes!</small><br>
    <small>2. Make sure you have ranged fighters early on. Grab yourself a Ranger or anyone
    who is fairly proficient in a bow. Imomen can handle herself pretty well with the bow so
    use her.</small><br>
    <small>3. Pimp on as many locals as possible and grab a few side quests for extra Cash
    flow. Basically talk to anyone who has a name other than commoner. </small><br>
    <small>4. Improve your Rep early. Do anything you can to improve your reputation with
    locals! This is an absolute must. Or at least have a high Charisma leader! I noticed the
    game is completely different when you play with a character of low charisma, everyone
    treats you like mud.</small><br>
    <small>5. Find as much combat early on in the game to Improve your level as it takes a
    loooong time to level up. Not kidding here...it took at least 12 hours of playing time
    just to get to 2nd level with my Fighter/Mage.</small></p>

    Nichols hits the boards and answers a typical whiner about why he is going to boycot ME.

    I say! How can these MB posters be so Anal?! It's sad to see so many people hit the EQ
    Boards and ME boards and complain constantly. Particularly the Rectal Chimps on the EQ
    Boards whining about why Beta 4 hasn't started yet. If I only had a way to shove some kind
    of digital sausage up their asses I would! Anyway here's Stephen.</small></p>

      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Here are my responses to your
      message: </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">1) You claim that we did very
      little to deal with and eliminate hackers in The Realm. I'd like to disagree here, but
      you're both right and wrong. As it sits now, there are no major hacking issues outstanding
      in the game. During my transition from The Realm to Middle-earth, there was quite a bit of
      difficulty in dealing with the issues that arose. We've worked past those problems. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">2) As for our PvP solutions, I
      can't comment too much. You're right that we will not allow people a pre-programmed and
      instant out from PvP. You're also right that we will not stop powerful players from
      killing weaker players. You're also right that we will provide severe in-game consequences
      to any murderers. Our rules will not allow players to store or use stolen property without
      serious in-game consequences. This will hopefully deal with the majority of mule-related
      issues. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">3) We will provide an in-game
      trading system. That's something that we always wanted in The Realm, but we never had the
      time to do it. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">4) I would be most interested in
      hearing, in more detail, why you think that the casual gamer will be destroyed by our
      current plans. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">As for boycotting Middle-earth,
      that is your perogative. Of course, I would prefer having a more in-depth discussion of
      your problems with our concepts instead of blind refusal. That's up to you. </font></small></p>

      potential sequel. As I have said before though, the basic classes will come first. There
      are a lot of perks and changes that AD&amp;D characters go through around the higher
      levels, and we want to make sure we draw from them. </font></small></p>

    <p><small>Here is Don talking a bit on Multiplayer. This might be an acquired taste for
    some people but basically it's just Single player with a friend or two or three.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Multiplayer works just like
      single player except that instead of you controlling a party member your friend does. In
      its simpliest form think of it as a party member with a very intelligent AI. In reality it
      can add alot to the game and make it more interesting, especially when you work together. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">As far as having 5 people in your
      party the beginning. Very quickly, you can have 5 NPC's in your party so there really is
      only a slight difference. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">When you meet NPC's you have the
      option of kicking an existing member out and replacing. One of the players will then
      assume control of this person. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">If you decide to play the game
      solo for awhile, you can go right ahead, now you control all 5 players. Once your friends
      come back they can resume control. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">You are playing with the same
      party members whether you are controlling all 5 members or they are all controlled
      individually so there is no such thing as your character being lvl 4 and your friend
      having a lvl 1. The whole party comes with you regardless of how many players are
      controlling the game. </font></small></p>
      <p><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"><small>It's all about options. If you
      want to give your players full control you can, if you don't want to give them buy and
      sell priveleges you can do that to.</small></font></p>

    <p><small>On the mission pack. Wow! Already 50% done!!</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Don't worry, we're hard at work
      at the mission pack (already 50% done). The mission pack is going to rock. The art is
      superior to the first game, and we're trying to do some new things with the A.I. (among
      many other things). </font></small></p>

    <p><small>Want to Print out your character for all the other chimps to see?</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Yes, you can take a screenshot of
      your character sheet and print it out. Thanks for correcting my earlier response. Perhaps
      in BG2 we'll have an in game method of printing your character sheet. </font></small></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Death can cause a level loss, but
      will never cause multiple level loss. It has less bite from levels 4-24, with a setback of
      a few hours to a day or two of gameplay at higher levels depending on your playstyle.
      Death bites :) Also, it's not uncommon for someone to die several more times while trying
      to retrieve a corpse. This *really* hurts. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Cleric will have some
      resurrection ability, some with the capability to reduce the death bite, but never
      completely and will be a very expensive spell to cast. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">There is also the potential for a
      completely unrecoverable corpse. It doesn't happen often, but when it does it hurts.</font></small></p>

    <p><small>So where are we at in Beta phases damnit? </small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Yes, it is still phase three, and
      last night it became evident that some more people have been invited quite recently.</font></small></p>

            incredibly Epic trips to the bathroom or incredibly fun games for us PC Gamers. In the
            case of this year we get both. BG has finally been released and it's everything Bioware
            said it would be except in multiplayer. But my biggest surprise has been Tribes! The most
            addicting Team game since Team Fortress. For anyone who is getting sick and tired of the
            same old FPS deathmatch, Tribes offers an incredible deal of strategy and action. Not to
            mention this is an actual screenshot from the game and not a cutscene! Head on over to
