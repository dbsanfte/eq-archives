      <p align="left"><font color="#8080C0">As the work-in-progress title suggested (RPG), Soul
      Bringer sets out its stall as a classical role-playing game set in a fantasy realm. The
      game will commence in mid-winter (so be sure to wear your mittens) upon the player's
      arrival in a sleepy village in search of your uncle Andrus. Throw any thoughts of familial
      endearment aside. Andrus' task is to relay his knowledge of sorcery and magic in exchange
      for gold. Yes, Andrus is truly a bastard of an uncle. Who needs an uncle like that when
      you've got a pawnbroker? Nevertheless, you will need to learn how to master and control
      magic by searching for and attaining the necessary riches for his tuition fees. The
      village and its folk will provide you with your best source of riches. Ultimately you will
      be able to barter for said riches by undergoing certain quests for the village people (no
      not the band that sang 'Y.M.C.A' and 'In the navy'). From there on it's entirely up to you
      where you go and what you do. It's as open ended as that. The future will be 'entirely in
      your hands' as they say. </font></p>

    <a href="mailto:sacrates@voodooextreme.com"><small>- Sacrates</small></a><br>
    <small>Luke was over on the Developers Board again posting some of his thoughts on
    weapons. This is fat so I thought I would post the whole shebang since it's fairly dead
    for news today.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Since you've
      collected them so nicely, I thought I'd address these concerns for the good of all,
      instead of bouncing around the board :)<br>
      <br>
      1) No S/M vs. L damage. This is a big issues that's been beaten to death, however it took
      two rounds longer 'cause my longsword was only doing 1-8 damage. <br>
      <br>
      Two rounds longer than what? The same battle replayed...where? BG has been balanced with
      our weapons as they are. It does work.<br>
      <br>
      2) Can't divide magic missle attacks between opponents. I think this was decided simply to
      make battling opposing mages more difficult. <br>
      <br>
      No, this was done because combat is a real-time adaptation. Directing the spell against
      more than one target would require an additional targeting step. Nothing to do with making
      opponents more difficult.<br>
      <br>
      3. Crippled Classes. Again, beaten to death, <br>
      <br>
      Sure, dual and multi-classes have better abilities and stats than the combo-characters
      such as the ranger, bard, etc. What is new about this? The single-class goes up in levels
      much faster, and have a couple special abilities the combo does not. There's your
      trade-off. <br>
      As for broadsword being the best weapon in the game? Um, perhaps this designation is best
      left until it is played? We don't have a broadsword, by the way. Short, long, bastard,
      two-handed. Each have their advantages and disadvantages, and it will be apparent. <br>
      <br>
      4. No scimitars. (although this is much less an issue now that all weapons are reasonably
      generic).<br>
      <br>
      I Agree that these should have been in. They aren't, but will be in the future. We picked
      the basic spread of weapons (as we did with character classes. The optional Druid class
      came after cleric, hence the unintentional loss). Yes the most popular character in the
      Realms uses them, but the ability to re-create Drizzt was never a thought in the
      forefront. Same deal with two-handed fighting. It will be dealt with in the future.<br>
      <br>
      5. Class options: Ranger/Cleric but no Ranger/Druid, Cleric/Mage but not Druid/Mage, no
      Fighter/Mage/Druid. I still can't understand why these options weren't implemented.<br>
      <br>
      This is an issue in the way that character information is stored. Allowable combinations
      are common to both dual and multi. This will be considered again in the sequel when we
      have time to restructure the basic characters, now that the process is better understood,
      though some classes will still not be available do to the rule inherent in AD&amp;D. For
      example, by the way, Ranger/Druid is not possible due to alignment conflicts (ranger must
      have good, druid must be true neutral). They exist in FR, sure, but are a special sect of
      the followers of one particular goddess. Rare as hens teeth, and will remain so.<br>
      Druid + mage does not make sense, considering they cannot use written magical items. Since
      the cleric and cleric sub-classes overrule combinations in regards to weapons allowed, the
      same considerations would make for one odd mage :P<br>
      <br>
      6. Mage spell acquisition. AFAIK mages must find spells and don't automatically receive
      additional spells of their choice for their spellbook when advancing in level. (this may
      have changed, I hope so but I'm not sure) I can see it now, a rogue opens a chest and the
      mage is in the background rubbing his hands together mumbling &quot;come on, papa needs a
      new scroll of fireball&quot;!<br>
      <br>
      Not sure which way you are falling on this one. Aside from their starting choices, Mages
      in BG must buy or find their spells, regardless of level. They do not simply
      &quot;know&quot; them on level-up like clerics.<br>
      <br>
      Just an additional note to no one in particular; the general feeling I get is that we have
      left weapon balancing until now. This is not the case. Weapons have been in lock-down for
      some months now. Balancing currently involves the toughness of encounters and such, within
      the context of the game as it is, meaning &quot;balanced for the weapons and spells and
      whatnot that the game WILL use.&quot; The game will not be harder because we do not have L
      damage, nor would it be easier if we did have it. It would be (and is) balanced
      accordingly.<br>
      <br>
      We have stayed as true to the AD&amp;D rules and the FEEL of the system as we could, and
      will continue to do so. Some changes will be made in the future, but I stand by the work
      we have done. To start slagging the game because of the few (!) discrepancies at this
      point is getting close to tunnel vision. Take a step back and keep the big picture in
      mind. It's a great game, you know, and it FEELS like AD&amp;D.</font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left"><small>And he caps it off with this bit O goodness.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Why use a two-hander
      instead of a longsword?<br>
      <br>
      Well, it's AD&amp;D, so they both strike the same number of times in a round. The
      Longsword hits once for moderate damage, the two-hander hits once for more damage. The
      longsword does a little less damage and hits sooner in the round(better speed factor), the
      two-hander does more and hits a little later. Maybe you want that extra bit of damage for
      a hobgoblin so you use the two-hander. Conversly, maybe you want to disrupt a mage
      quickly, so you use the longsword (or shortsword, or dagger).<br>
      <br>
      Additionally, if you have a bow equipped in a &quot;quick-weapon&quot; slot you cannot
      have a shield equipped. Might as well pack that two-hander, unless of course you still
      want to disrupt that mage...decisions decisions.<br>
      <br>
      As for Role-play reasons...you try and tell that Conan-sized 18/96 fighter that he should
      use a longsword. </font></small></p>

    <small>With yet more RPG goodness, Desslock has put up the first part of a MASSIVE
    interview with Richard Garriot aka Lord British of Ultima fame. It looks like if you have
    any questions that remain unanswered, this interview will cover them :). Check out the
    first part of the interview <a href="http://desslock.gamespot.com/features/ultima/interview-index.html">here</a>, and
    here's a snippet to whet yer appetite.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"><strong>Desslock:</strong>
      You've indicated that this will be the last Ultima to feature the Avatar as the player
      character, and that as the ninth core game in the series, Ultima: Ascension will mark the
      end of the &quot;trilogy of trilogies&quot; with a truly epic story-line. Are you
      satisfied that the plot of Ultima: Ascension has shaped up in a way that meets those
      ambitious goals?</p>
      <p><strong>Richard Garriott:</strong> Let me answer an even longer question than the one
      you've asked. Whenever I talk about Ultima: Ascension to people who are relatively
      familiar with Ultima series, I like to introduce the story by first talking about the
      events in the series that led up to Ultima IX [Ultima: Ascension], and what I see as the
      most important elements of previous Ultima stories.</p>
      <p>Like you said, I see this game as the end of the &quot;trilogy of trilogies&quot;,
      which is really the way I feel about the game. If you look at the first three Ultimas,
      they really only related to each other by name. They were set in different worlds, had
      radically different design approaches, and they didn't have epic plots. </p>
      <p>They were largely just &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; style, medieval adventure
      games. I only really tied the stories together after the fact, whenever I started the next
      game in the series.</font></small></p>

      seeing other players a function of line of sight. Not really a fog of war, but something
      similar. <br>

      changes (under a second in most cases). Would you prefer the alternative provided by UO
      (i.e. Walk, pause, Walk, pause...)? The room-based approach simplifies a great many things
      and allows us to control the saturation of players in any particular area. No matter how
      fast our servers are, no modem will be able to handle the information needed to update
      more than 30 people at one time (and that's optimistic). What do you do if you walk into a
      crowded area with 200 people? Certainly, there are solutions to this, but they are all
      pretty ugly to implement and provide peculiar behavior to the player. Let's take UO for
      example. Have you ever been walking about in UO and suddenly see a castle appear right
      next to you? Or perhaps you may see a naked person appear for a split second before his
      clothes. Those are all side effects that arise from trying to provide the world
      information to each player when things come within a certain distance. I'll choose the
      room-based approach (with whopping large rooms) over the walk, lag and see bizarre
      artifacts approach any day.</small><br>

    Greg was doing the posting yesterday so i'll toss a few of his goodies your way. First a
    little lovin on XP ceiling again.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">But I will say this
      regarding some of these decisions... they are being made to balance game play (final work)
      versus recode the game (things totally FUBARed - not final work).<br>
      <br>
      Much of the work on Baldur's Gate is being done with additional products in mind. For
      example, Rangers and Paladins don't get spell use until 8th and 9th levels, respectively.
      Now this will not be possible in BG, but the abilities are actually in the game RIGHT NOW.
      If we were to remove the XP ceiling, hypothetically your Rangers and Paladins could level
      up to the point where they gain spell use and they could start memorizing(praying) for
      spells...<br>
      <br>
      So don't get too worried about the XP ceiling. We could raise or lower it depending upon
      how play testing went... people have played all the way through the game without the new,
      higher ceiling, but it was felt that folks would appreciate the ability to advance a
      little more and gain greater skills... the decision was made based upon 'fun factor' not
      as anything that will really impact game play one way or the other... By the time you
      reach the new, higher ceiling (if anyone does) you will have more than reached the point
      where you could have completed this first game.</font></small></p>

    <p align="left"><small>And here is some juicy biscuits on Weapons.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">I'm going to throw
      this out for folks to gnaw on, because it is an obvious question no one has asked.<br>
      <br>
      What about missile weapons? <br>
      <br>
      If because of the way BG is set up, you can pretty much fire at anything within your range
      of sight, what is the difference between a short bow, long bow and composite bow? In
      AD&amp;D they all do the same damage (with &quot;to hit&quot; adjustments) but given that
      almost all missile combat in BG is at short range, why would you prefer to own a long bow
      over a short bow?<br>
      <br>
      I am throwing this out to illustrate something... which is that while we will be as close
      as possible to AD&amp;D rules, there will be areas that we will have to stray from
      somewhat. The missile weapon issue we have already addressed (or we have a plan to
      address) but I'd like to hear people's opinions on this...<br>
      <br>
      So, since this is a development board, let's discuss two areas...<br>
      <br>
      1) How should weapon damage work if we cannot offer separate damage for S/M versus L
      monsters? (People shouldn't get too nervous about this... 95% or more of the monsters in
      the game are S/M)<br>
      <br>
      2) How should we resolve the missile weapon thing? (For bows and crossbows)<br>
      <br>
      This is asking for feedback... the game is in final balancing right now and a tweak of a
      +1 here or there to adjust weapons to make the system work better is totally appropriate.</font></small></p>

    <p align="left"><small>Good God, the man is a posting machine!</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Different damage
      versus Large creatures is out...<br>
      <br>
      I just found this out today - but it is because I am finalizing the manual - there are
      some references to Large damage here and there, but no mention in the damage tables... <br>
      <br>
      Large damage went away because of the following (from a programming standpoint):<br>
      <br>
      1) There are NOT very many Large monsters in the game.<br>
      <br>
      2) It would require adding another item information 'slot' for weapon damage against Large
      creatures.<br>
      <br>
      3) It would require adding another monster information 'slot' for monster size.<br>
      <br>
      Though this doesn't sound like much, it adds significantly to the complexity of the
      game... it adds an extra processing step when you attack in order to ascertain the monster
      size, it adds another step to ascertain the proper damage table to be used. It may not
      sound like much, but when 95% of the time you are battling kobolds, wizards, bandits,
      hobgoblins, etc, etc it takes its toll...<br>
      <br>
      The balancing issue comes down to final tweaks - not total code rewrites. A perfect
      example of this is we are going over EVERY character class in the game from a quality
      control standpoint to make sure we understand where we are relative to AD&amp;D rules, and
      to make sure that the manual and the game play are totally consistent. This is not a very
      easy task especially because of the complexity of some of the classes, and the fact that
      we have to be 100% fixed in our application of rules, when AD&amp;D allows flexibility on
      the part of the DM.<br>
      <br>
      For example, the Paladin... <br>
      All of the core abilities were in, but we only have room for so many special abilities. We
      felt that Protection from Evil (as an innate ability) was more important than Cure Disease
      (once per week), so Protection from Evil went in as a special ability... however, Holy
      Swords? none in BG (though we may have them in the expansion) War Horse at 4th level? none
      in BG (but damn, would we love to do horses soon) Now to balance some of this out, we
      allow Paladins to specialize in weapons, which is NOT allowed in AD&amp;D 2nd edition
      rules... so you can see how there is a little 'balancing' here and there that is needed to
      make the game 'work' in a computer setting.<br>
      <br>
      The weird thing about the Large damage issue... I have been playing the game for a month
      now, and if I weren't helping with the manual I would have never noticed the absence... I
      manage to kill all my ogre mages, it just requires a slightly different application of
      tactics... fighters are NOT weak characters in the game... throw in weapon specialization
      and you will be slicing things up without too many worries... ;)</font></small></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Building a character
      was fast and simple. I got a decent roll on my first try and threw together a fighter with
      2 large sword and 2 bow proficiencies. Graphics are of course impressive. The amount of
      detail put into each area gives the game an atmosphere and personality of its own. Because
      many of the buildings, trees, and roads, are all unique, you&#146;ll always be able to
      have a rough idea of what city you are in. About half the sounds were working I was told.
      We heard running water to the east, then moving over to investigate, we found a waterfall.
      The soft music, the sound of birds, and the crickets at night brought the world to life. <br>
      <br>
      Many of the characters who would join your party had their voices, and had many
      interesting and funny comments in different situations. You will get a good laugh and have
      a more interesting game if you decide to take along a few of the characters included with
      BG, rather than making an entire party for yourself. You will definitely need a diverse
      group of characters in your party. Each class is useful in one way or another, and you
      will need almost one of each class if you hope to live. I wasn&#146;t sure what to expect
      from fighting, thinking it would be similar to Diablo, but it&#146;s not even close. I was
      surprised how much strategy it takes when fighting, and there will require lots of
      thinking if you want to survive many of the battles. Ben was accurate when he said that
      &quot;You have to use your head (and a good sword doesn&#146;t hurt ;)). Combat is so
      different from any other RPG of the past.&quot; Scripting works great, but it was more fun
      to pause the game and control each of the characters individually. </font></small></p>

      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">It is not necessary to actually
      have a club / staff in your possession to cast Shillelagh. In BG, a magical shillelagh is
      'created' that you wield for all of the same effects as are stated in the AD&amp;D rules;
      when the spell expires, the club 'disappears'. The next logical question is how this
      differs from Spiritual Hammer. Spiritual Hammer causes slightly different damage (bonuses
      to hit and damage increase based on the level of the caster) and, most importantly, a
      Spiritual Hammer can be wielded at a distance (i.e. smiting your foes while standing a
      distance to the rear of your party). </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Three types of quick slots: quick
      weapon, quick spell and quick item. Quick weapon and quick spell are determined by your
      class. For example, a fighter will get 4 quick weapons, but no quick spells (obviously). A
      wizard will get 1 quick weapon, and 3 quick spells. A cleric will get 1 [2?] quick weapon
      and 2 quick spells, and so on (Note that the quick spell slots are really just for
      convenience. If you are a spellcaster, you will always have a 'cast spell' slot that you
      can use to cast a memorized spell in combat without un-pausing the game during selection).
      Every character, regardless of class, gets 3 quick item slots. These are used for items
      that do NOT have a direct physical attack. For example potions, scrolls, etc. The items
      need to have a use, however, and are not just inventory slots to store extra weapons,
      armor, etc. The only thing I have to check with Bioware on is the treatment of magic items
      that have both physical AND magical attacks (a magic staff, for example). According to the
      manual, you can somehow have the weapon equipped in a quick weapon slot, while having the
      magic power equipped in the quick item slot. I don't know how this would work and haven't
      encountered it in the game yet, so I'll have to post more on this later. </font></small></p>
