        <li><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The leader of the guild must email
          Eqguilds@sonyinteractive.com. The header of the email must contain the NAME of the guild.
          In this email the leader will include a short Charter that includes the guild's role in
          Norrath. In addition, the leader needs to list at least 9 other characters that have
          agreed to form this guild. </font></small></li>

          approval via email and told to approach a GM for formation of the guild. If 989 has any
          reservations about either the name or the charter, the guild leader will receive an email

    <p><small>Also, Brad had a few things about the dreaded player wipe. It's gonna happen
    right before Beta 4 begins. Luckily I am in transition now with characters switching from
    a Wizard to either a Cleric or Paladin so the change won't hurt that much. Still, it's <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>gonna sting like it's nobodies bidness </strong></font>due to the

    <small>Well, I will officially dish out a look at it soon but feel I need to give it a few
    more hours to do it justice. A few things that I haven't seen many other sites touch on is
    the colors in the game. The changes from night and day are absolutely gorgeous due to the
    fact that everythings color changes in proportion to how much the sky changes. You'll find
    yourself in combat with a Skeleton and notice that it's color changes depending on what
    the sky looks like. Very cool affect. Also, the <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>character
    animation is one of the nicest touches</strong></font> I have seen. Player Characters look
    exactly like you've seen in the shots, but the monster animations are superb! You've
    probably heard all the hype surrounding spell effects? Believe it! They are very
    impressive. Anyway, keep checking back and you may get a surprise you two. </small></p>

      colorfully rendered with excellent artwork. Characters are somewhat blocky in appearance
      but have a wealth of colorful textures for clothing and items. 3D models of the characters
      accurately reflect the armor they are wearing and their weapons. Movement can be
      controlled by the mouse or by using the arrow keys. Using the control key with either
      method causes the characters to run. One big complaint I have with the graphics is the
      camera angles that are used to show the action.</font></small></p>

    daily informant </a>made an update on the progress of this interesting looking RPG. Stop
    by and read up on it or just read it below.</small></p>
    <i><blockquote>
      <p></i><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Boy, a lot of what I've been
      doing recently sounds deadly dull and not particularly game-related: </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Stuff like going through all the
      missions, gathering up data from the mission designers and seeing what objects and
      characters we need to make our world come alive and seem real. Prioritizing all those
      thousands of pieces of artwork so artists know what to work on first and second and third
      and so on. Translating that information into a spreadsheet with checkboxes so we can track
      work as it's completed. Seeing if we can cut anything to make it more likely we'll ship
      before the end of the millennium. That kind of thing. Yawn. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">On a more fun, game-related note,
      I've done a bit of designer map checking, to make sure the look and feel is what we want
      and that gameplay will be up to snuff. I've been working with programmer, Al Yarusso, to
      fine-tune how our computer monitors are going to work and how the last details of our
      interface are going to look. Right now, I'm going through every NPC in the game, making
      sure we know enough about their behavior in all situations -- combat and otherwise -- and
      what weapons they carry and so on. We already know their roles in the game pretty well but
      I need to make sure Scott Martin, the AI god, knows how each NPC should behave at all
      times. I've been talking a lot with Christian Divine, the conversation writer, about how
      we're going to get across the murky conspiratorial stuff that's the heart of the game --
      man, does he have a big job ahead of him! I've done a fair amount of PR stuff -- magazine
      interviews and the like -- which is kinda fun, even if it does distract from the work of
      making a game... </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The toughest thing I've had to do
      recently was evaluate each of our missions -- now that the design is fleshed out -- and
      see if we'd overdesigned anywhere. If you've ever worked on a game you know how seductive
      and dangerous the kitchen sink design approach can be. And, surprise, surprise, we had
      some stuff in the game that just didn't fit anymore. So, to ensure quality and ease the
      inevitable schedule crunch to come, I made some mission cuts. I remember when I was
      writing for a living, someone very wise told me always to edit out the thing (the word,
      the paragraph, the chapter, whatever) that you love the most because that thing you think
      is so cool, will just draw attention to itself and stick out like a sore thumb. I cut the
      missions that stuck out. We lost a couple of cool locations but shored up some other ones
      pretty dramatically. And the game is much stronger for the tightening and increased focus.
      No fooling -- no one'll ever miss the cut missions (which is why I cut them, of
      course...). </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">I guess I've taken the holidays
      and the beginning of a new year to kind of post-mortem the state of the project and make
      sure we have a solid plan for moving ahead. I set out some new, clearer goals for the team
      (which I think I'll just keep under my hat until we've met 'em!). </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">We're at the point where we have
      all the tools necessary to create a great game and a lot of the assets we need. We know
      what we have to do. Now, it's just a question of staying focused and concentrating on the
      job at hand (and not getting sucked any further into Half-Life, Thief: The Dark Project,
      Zelda 64, Southpark, Baldur's Gate and all the other terrific games that have distracted
      us over the last couple of months!). If we do that, Deus Ex will rock. </font></small></p>

    <small>Desslock dishes up the final installment to his<a href="http://desslock.gamespot.com/features/ultima/uointerview-1a.html"> Interview on
    Ultima Online </a>that you should stop by and see. To me, UO is so far and away inferior
    to EQ it's like Yin and Yang. Again I apologize for the lack of posts but you know exactly
    what I am doing. Don't worry though...I'll get caught up when I get back to reality. <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>&quot;If&quot; I get back to reality that is</strong></font>.</small></p>

    <small>Another quick update until I<font color="#FFFFFF"><strong> get back to work in
    Norrath.</strong></font> Abashi made a brief appearance on the boards today with a few
    goodies you may be interested in. This first one is on Shadows in the game.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">But yes, you are correct, 3D
      objects do not cast shadows on the environment. Shadows add tons of processing time that
      could be better used to render frames. Each shadow must be calculated in relationship to
      the lightsource, distorted, then cast with tranperancy. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">In order to make the hardware
      requirements necessary, the game is shadow free.</font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>Here is a great one on the availability of Artifacts in the game. This sounds
    very cool to me. When I get one of those rare items I want it to be extremely rare and not
    like Godly plate in Diablo.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">A note on Artifacts. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">There generally won't be
      artifacts &quot;available&quot; for anyone. Artifacts are unique items (only one in the
      world) and will be distributed on an as-earned basis. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">So, to answer your question, if
      you are playing a monk, and you are deserving of an artifact, there will indeed be an
      artifact for you. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">But no one should expect to ever
      earn an artifact, they will be *very* rare.</font></small></p>

    <small>No, we're not doing the Billy thing and selling Altered Snacks yet. (You never
    know) Although Tuna flavored Bubble Gum sounds pretty good. Excuse the slim pickings,
    we'll have more your way later this afternoon. After yesterdays EQ Marathon (10 freaking
    hours!), i'm ready to get started again, but this time have a few chores that must be done
    also. Stuff like take the Blow up dolls to the dry cleaners etc. Ironically I still
    haven't ventured out of my homeland of Felwithe just yet. Since I am a Wizard, it would be
    insanity to venture out too far alone. Otherwise I <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>would

    <small>After that last bit it would be hard to beat. There also haven't been many posts to
    the boards lately. These guys must run in spurts. Anyway, Abashi was on the board shortly
    and had this to say about paying for the Beta 4 cd. I have actually seen some posts that
    accuse 989 of trying to make a profit off the Beta cd's for gods sake! All your paying for
    here is the cost of the CD and pressing etc. The <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Next time I
    see one of those posts I am going to go ballistic</strong></font>!</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">To my knowledge, the cost is only
      for the CD and shipping, if that changes, I will let you all know. Asking someone to pay
      for shipping that many CD's is not a crime. I guess its a question of either to pay it now
      of pay it when the game comes out. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">One thing to keep in mind is that
      even the current beta testers will have to pay to get the CD.</font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>Here's a small piece on the NDA. I do this same thing also. Luckily for me I am
    designated as Press and therefore NDA does not apply. Like it really matters anyway, since
    I can't find a bad thing to say about the game so far.</small></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style" size="2">We are finally able to announce
      some dates! Most of the announcements will go out tomorrow, but I had the chance to post
      them here tonight, and I know people have been waiting a long time, so here goes: </font></p>
      <p><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style" size="2">EverQuest will be released on
      March 16, 1999. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style" size="2">Phase 4 testing will begin
      early-mid February (I'll hopefully have a more precise date soon, but it should be some
      time between the 1st and 15th). </font></p>
      <p><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style" size="2">We will be sending out an email
      to all registered beta testers (yes, the one we had hoped to send out in early December)
      explaining how and where to sign up for Phase 4 next week. This will include pricing. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style" size="2">So there you have it. So far
      the beta test has been a huge success, and we appreciate both those who have participated,
      and patience of those who could not, who have been waiting. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style" size="2">Phase 4 is around the corner,
      and the release of the game around the next. It's a very exciting time for us, but at the
      same time there's still a lot of work to be done, and I and the team will deliver the game
      you all have been waiting for shortly. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style" size="2">Thanks for your continued
