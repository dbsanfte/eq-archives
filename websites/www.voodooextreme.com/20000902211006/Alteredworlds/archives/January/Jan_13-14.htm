    <b><i><blockquote>

      &quot;feel.&quot; I think we did a good job capturing the feel of an adventuring party,
      with internal problems as well as external. Of course I really would like to expand on
      this area as well, and there are a lot of things we would like to see in a sequel that we
      didn't have time to implement. As well, I really want to see if we can continue to capture
      the real essence of AD&amp;D character growth, in that it's not all just numbers,
      especially at the higher levels when pure stat advancement slows.</font></small></p>

    <small>Ok getting close to calling it cut off point for the Baldur's Gate Reviews, but

    <i><blockquote>
      <p></i><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Baldur's Gate represents
      innovation and style as well as possible. With true AD&amp;D rules, emmersive gameplay,
      incredible depth of the story and graphics to beat, this is definitely one RPG worth
      playing. This is, I'd say, &quot;as RPG as it gets&quot; - so if you're not keen on the
      whole &quot;do a damage roll: roll 1D6&quot; thing, you might need to read the 160 page
      manual that comes with it. It's worth it at the end, though... and while Fallout is still
      the best RPG I've ever played (please, no flame mail about what is defined as an
      &quot;RPG&quot; and how Ultima VII is the best RPG of all time), Baldur's Gate is most
      definitely a game worth playing. </font></small></p>

      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Roberta Williams: </b>This is
      still an adventure game; the core of an adventure game is an interactive story along with
      exploration and puzzle-solving. This game has all of that. What it has is extra stuff on
      top of the 'normal' adventure game stuff; it has some action and simple RPG elements to it
      to enhance the adventure game experience. The new gamers of today seem to have little
      patience for more 'old-fashioned' adventure games, and it seemed that they needed to be
      spiced up a little bit. I think we succeeded admirably with that task with KQ: Mask of

      trained and educated you, and you think of him as a father (he probably did shag your mom,

      gold (find a sword, get antidote, standard stuff really) when suddenly you get attacked by

      <i><p></i><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">It is just as easy for me
      to post what we have been up to in the programing side so let me drop some notes here: </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">1) We removed all words related
      to religion and replaced it with the word deity </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">2) We added a new feature that
      you can now display your name if you want to everyone. You have 3 choices. A) Display no
      name B) Display your real Character Name and C) Display the alternate name. C can only be
      changed by two classes during game play. That is the Thief and the assassin. It will have
      to be a successful skill check to have it changed. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">3) We are working on spell
      affects. Since we have particle and storm affects now in the game, we wanted to make sure
      when a spell caster casts it is seen. We are getting those affects down now. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">4) Weather has now been fully
      introduced. Rain, snow, the thunder the lighting is now done </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">5) The user interface is coming
      to a close. We will be releasing Screen shots to UKC showing how we have the interface. It
      is easy to use and understand. We hope to release shots this week, next week at the
      latest. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">6) The 16bit conversion is
      finally coming to an end. We lost 39 levels during the conversion process. And are
      re-doing them as fast as we can. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">7) Kaid and Ross Systems are
      working on the final set of Icons and Buttons on the game. Since we converted to 16bit we
      are now converting all the buttons and icons to 16bit also. We are also changing some of
      them. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">8) The player manual is being
      touched up; screen shots are being taken for it. We plan to have a few users edit it for
      us. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">9) We have everyone confirmation
      number ready. Once we post the alpha date 2 weeks prior to the release you will receive
      your confirmation and NDA. You have 2 weeks, to have the NDA back at us. The faster you
      get the NDA back to us the faster you will get your CD. People asked could we rush them.
      We are toying with that. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">10) We are discussing
      communication now in depth in the game. We see the potential problem of abuse in the game.
      We have also seen the lag it does generate and plan to place a post today on this message
      board on how we would like to set it up. I suggest you read the post and give us your
      views. This is going to be a debate people. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">11) We are adding latency and FPS
      that are removable to the game as we speak. We will make it in option that you can removed
      or display </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">12) Last Kaid is working on the
      monsters and we are animating them as fast as we can. We will have between 50-60 monsters
      in the alpha done. We will be introducing monsters during the alpha, until we get all 111
      monsters in the game. Yes we will have 111 different monsters in the game. Not counting
      some of these 111 monsters will be the same model but with different weapons, swords,
      spears and shield. </font></small></p>

    <small>Interested in Beta testing an<font color="#FFFFFF"><strong> upcoming massive
    multiplayer game </strong></font>other than AC and EQ? Just got word of this from my boy
    Lorien over at Gagames. Check this plan file for the goods below or head over to <a href="http://www.gamesgalore.ca/wof/">their site</a> and learn more about it. </small></p>

      <i><p></i><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">We have decided that this
      would be an appropriate time to conduct a limited test of our Alpha code, primarily of our
      server. We plan on testing the following systems: </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">1. General Connectivity.
      Client-Server communications.<br>
      2. Account creation &amp; login. Accounts will be free for the test, no credit card
      needed.<br>
      3. Character Creation.<br>
      4. Combat.<br>
      5. Magic.<br>
      6. Dynamic world, if possible.<br>
      7. Questing.<br>
      8. You will note that the graphics engine and user interface is not in the above list. 9.
      Frankly, it isn't remotely ready for testing because we have been focusing all of our
      efforts into the server. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">As for when these tests will be
      occuring, the dates have yet to be decided. That issue will be resolved after the internal
      testing this weekend. It could be next week, it could be next month. I will say that it
      will likely be in the next 3-7 weeks. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Alpha testers will be rewarded by
      automatically being included in any Worlds of Fantasy beta test that occurs if and when
      one does occur (which is very likely sometime down the road). I need at most 50 testers
      for this test, although if I get a little over 50 total applications I will allow
      everybody to be included (i.e. if I get 53 applications I will not excluded the last 3. If
      I get 200 application I will take the first 50 only). </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">If you are interested in this
      please contact me at games@gamesgalore.ca. Include the email address where you wish to be
      contacted, and your machine specifications (processor, amount of RAM, modem brand, &amp;
      modem speed are all that is required for this test). </font></small></p>

    <small>VN has done it again and brought us some more goodies from the guys working on
    Lands of Lore. I'm not exactly ecstatic about this game but i'm sure one or two or three
    of you are so i'm gonna <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>slap the bastard up</strong></font>.

    <small>Let the deluge begin. We're going to be swamped with a thousand plus one Baldur's
    Gate reviews soon and guess what? We're not going to cover all of them like we usually do
    with most reviews. I am only going to post BG reviews that have<font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>
    a fairly different take</strong></font> than the others many times. Nobody wants to read
    the same thing over and over again. Anyway, here's <a href="http://www.gamepower.com/games/html/5510review.html">Gamepower's take</a> on the
    issue.</small><font face="Arial" color="#C1C1FF"><strong> </strong></font></p>

    <small>Well, here is something unusual lately?<font color="#FFFFFF"><strong> Slim pickings
    for Everquest news</strong></font>. At least Abashi hit the Development Board and tossed
    up a few that piqued my interest. His first one is probably the most controversial issue
    in the Beta at the moment.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Any information floating around
      on how the transition from phase 3 to phase 4 will be handled is rumor and supposition.
      This information has not been released to the dev team by anyone. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">In previous phases people were
      allowed to take one character from one phase to the next, that was how it was done in
      those phases but does not necessarily have any bearing on P4. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">I have heard arguements saying
      things like &quot;you don't want to have 1500 level 1 players running around a
      server&quot;. Since there are currently 4000+ people in beta, and phase 4 will consist of
      between 10x and 20x that number, the arguement is moot. And for release, that will be the
      case anyway. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The only valid arguement for
      keeping a character from P3 to P4 is that 989 still needs to have people testing the mid
      and high level zones. A complete wipe from P3 to P4 will hamper this effort. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">This is the only arguement being
      weighed by the dev team, though a decision is still pending.</font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>And of course always a little something on lag etc. Let me put it this way, the
    Network code in EQ is simply beautifull! As good as, and &quot;maybe&quot; better than
    even the great Tribes at the moment. Even though i'm on Cable Modem I have been getting 0%
    packet loss to and from the server! On my regular modem (Which I confess to not using much
    anymore for obvious reasons) I still got a damn fair ping. Read on you Euro chimps.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">I spoke to a guy playing from the
      UK today. He was playing with a 350 ping and 5% p-loss. Those are fantastic stats. EQ
      Screams with those stats.</font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>Here's his feeling on Guilds and Halls.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">This stuff really hasn't been
      worked out in its entirety yet. I personally expect the number of guildhalls to be
      controlled via the economy, with them becoming more and more expensive as the &quot;ideal
      number&quot; of guildhalls is approached. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">But that's just my feeling, I've
      no data to support that.</font></small></p>

            experienced. Let me put it this way, there hasn't been a day that has gone by without me
            putting in at least 8 or more hours in EQ since I got it. You know the crazy thing about
            it? In Diablo I would have finished the game by that time. In UO I would be a fairly
