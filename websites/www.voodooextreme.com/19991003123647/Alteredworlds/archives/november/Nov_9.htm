      -- SYSTRAN Software, Inc. announces that it has entered into a licensing arrangement with

      the introduction of a unique on-the-fly translation program in ORIGIN's just released
      online only game, Ultima(tm) Online: The Second Age. The Second Age was developed at
      ORIGIN's Austin, Texas studios. ORIGIN(tm) is a wholly owned subsidiary of Electronic

      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">SYSTRAN's translation technology,
      which comes installed with The Second Age, can automatically translate many different
      natural languages, effectively eliminating language barriers in worldwide online gaming.
      It takes into account the grammatical structure of each language and uses rules to
      transfer the grammatical structure of the source language (text to be translated) into the
      target language (translated text). </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Four language pairs are included
      in The Second Age / SYSTRAN translator: English to German, German to English, English to
      Japanese and Japanese to English. Other language pairs are supported by the program and
      will be available for download soon from The Second Age web site (http://www.owo.com/t2a).

      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">&quot;This partnership proves

      millions of people use the web for communication,&quot; said Laurent Pontegnier, SYSTRAN's

    <small>Lorien is the man...seems that the rumors of Games Galore stopping development on
    their 3D RPG Worlds of Fantasy were a bit premature (I hear there's a <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>cream you can get for that</strong></font> though). Here's the
    scoop from Jason Bernard, Lead Games Designer.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"><small>I would like to clarify the
      recent announcement of the &quot;cancellation&quot; of Worlds of Fantasy. Worlds of
      Fantasy has not been cancelled. We have suspended active development of the game for a
      short period of time. What this means is that we aren't writing any new code for the time
      being. The reason for this is that it became apparent to us that our current development
      path was not going to meet with success. We are pursuing some very promising opportunities
      to get us back on track. </p>
      <p>As I have stated before, Worlds of Fantasy is a great role playing system. The paper
      and pen version of it has been played many times and was very much enjoyed. I am very
      confident that a computer version of Worlds of Fantasy will be equally as much fun. </p>
      <p>I apologise if my original message on the official Worlds of Fantasy page was somewhat
      misleading. Also, I have reopened our <a href="http://www.gamesgalore.ca/wof/wofboard.html" target="_blank">bulletin board</a>
      where I welcome your questions and comments.</small></font></p>

    the ride too. It's really good to see the Author <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>getting
    into this game</strong></font> and seem so knowledgable about it at the same time. Anyway
    here is Mr Feist talking about Puzzles and traps oh my.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">There are no word-lock chests. I
      never liked the concept much and found them very intrusive to the &quot;literary&quot;
      sense of the game. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">But there are puzzles. There are
      no puzzles that you can't find an alternative solution for, i.e. the thing behind the
      puzzle is also located somewhere else, or you can get to it through another set of rooms,
      or if you kill enough things, it opens anyway, etc. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Chests are all trapped/locked,
      and part of the deal is that as James gets better at picking locks/disarming traps, they
      get easier to open. You have a choice of either using a &quot;twitch&quot; reflex (you
      have to click on a swinging pointer as it comes between two points) or you can use a dice
      roll. For those who are &quot;twitched-challenged&quot; you're going to want to build up
      James's theif skills a lot, else carry a LOT of healing potion.</font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>And here is Sinjin coming in with the killing blow to top off what Mr Feist
    said.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">What Ray was referring to was an
      alternative method to lockpicking, it is not the primary method. The lock picking is a
      skill based system for the player and presents an opportunity for the player to learn the
      trap system over time, building a history. For those who, as Ray says, challenged in this
      area we do have an alternative method that is based on a success percentage based on
      successful previous experience, not a pure &quot;dice roll.&quot; </font></small></p>

      <p></font><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Making games is a lot like
      being in a cult. There are the long days without sleep bowing before the glowing one who
      delivers all knowledge, slaving away at your work towards the ultimate end. Family,
      friends, and all trappings of your former life must be left behind, for this holy quest is
      something on which they cannot accompany you. With your new family, you must become one
      with your mission, for it is all that can save you from damnnation. You must wear special
      shoes, drink the blood of goats, stockpile automatic firearms, and work towards each
      milestone as if it were the last in preparation for the day of reckoning. The ritual
      castration is optional, but I hear its growing in popularity amongst developers, libido
      can be horrible distraction. We have much work that must be accomplished on this worldly
      plane before we are complete, but rest assured, the heavily armed ATF agents will have to

      using for all the speech. I t would seen strange to hear am NPC talk in one voice, and say
      your name in another. As has been said before, the player will be referred to as Avatar.</font></small></p>

      The information about taming dragons is not correct. They will not be tamable.</font></small></p>

      the correct actor to play the Avatar. We went through many many hours of auditions for the
      casting of UA, and we still have more to do. Finding actors to play the 175+ characters in
      the game is indeed a huge task, and the Origin Audio Department is working hard to make
      everything sound great.<br>
      <br>
      It will be a few more weeks until we have a final cast list.</font></small></p>

    <small>Looks like more and more Sites are clamoring to get some more dope on this Easter
    Egg! After doing that Interview with Ragnar Tornquist I can honestly say<font color="#FFFFFF"><strong> this game is gonna kick a lot of people in the monkey business</strong></font>.
    Anyway Gamelinks.net kicked up a<a href="http://www.gamelinks.net/previews-longestjourney.html"> sparkly little Preview</a>

    <small>The rumor mill is kicking into overgear at the moment on 3DFX's next offering and
    it sounds like a doozy. Supposedly the thing is 3 times more powerfull than a V2 chip! But
    again <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>this is one of those catch 22 situations.</strong></font>
    If your processor is a Stumpy instead of an Arnold then you won't experience a great
    amount of difference. You've really gotta have a beast of a machine for the processor to
    catch up to what the board is doing. Time to start pimping for change for that new PII
    500. Voodoonation has ripped up <a href="http://3dfx.dimension3d.com/3dguide/root/articles/tom/voodoo3.htm">some speculation</a>
