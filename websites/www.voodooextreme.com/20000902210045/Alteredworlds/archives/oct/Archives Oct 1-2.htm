    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#ff00ff">Another week (well maybe
      a little more than that), and we've gotten a whole lot of stuff done. We are down to 10
      Quests that need to be fixed for everything to be working. This may sound like we haven't
      gotten tons done, but some of those will be coming off in the build tomorrow, and we added
      a few things that really needed to take as high priority as a Quest. </p>
      <p align="left">We had a big meeting with QA on Monday and went over a bunch of the
      problems that they were having with the game. There seemed to be two main problems: Random
      Encounters were too tough, and a group of Golden Geckos could take out a 40th level
      character. There were about 40 other things that we talked about as well. Some of the
      things we have already dealt with, others we should figure out by next Monday, and others
      are a part of the ongoing balance testing that we are doing. </p>
      <p align="left">One of the big problems was that partymember chem use can be set to
      &quot;Any Drug, Any time&quot; and the partymembers are really taking this seriously. Once
      you go into combat, your partymember that is set to this will use all their AP's every
      round to take any chem they have in their inventory. So one tester had Sulik (a tribal
      guy) boost himself with three shots of Buffout and one shot of Jet in the first round of
      combat. And Sulik was just getting started - by the third round of combat he had take
      every chem in his inventory. Needless to say this is getting changed. </p>
      <p align="left">We still have the random encounter bug hanging around that when Bounty
      Hunters get killed they turn into Shelving Units or Fruit Tables. </p>
      <p align="left">We are also working on toning down some of the language in the game. I'm
      not talking about four letter words, but rather exchanges between NPC's that make a group
      of 4 or 5 25 year old guys from California wince. We are all pretty jaded and if it gets a
      reaction like that out of us, then we know it is too much. But don't worry we are still
      using that Mature rating as much as we can handle it. </p>
      <p align="left">Other stuff on the game is going well. The artists are working on
      &quot;fluff&quot; art that is being put in just to make the areas look even better, and
      they are working over certain pieces of art that look good, but could look even better. </p>
      <p align="left">We are getting pretty close, but we are going to work on the game until we
      feel it is balanced well and that it lives up to the first one. </p>
      <p align="left">It's midnight, I'm going home (had to get at least one whine in here so
      that Desslock can make fun of me about) :) </font></small></p>

    <b><i><blockquote>
      <p align="left"></i></b><font color="#FF00FF">Writer Daniel James on the nature of magic :
      The Grey Wanderer's post is quite simply splendid. There will be considerable restrictions
      on the nature of magic and its use. The above notes are closely akin to our research in
      this regard. Men studied Sorcery, yet lack Elvish 'magic'. Does the Sorcerer wield innate
      power, or use chemistry and occult rituals to provoke fear and devotion? We are committed
      to consistency with Tolkien's works. Temper your interpretation of the terms used for
      classes and so forth with that knowledge. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FF00FF">Writer/Researcher Nancy Grimsley on elves in the
      Fourth Age: I've noticed earlier posts about elves and have wanted to add some comments
      about elves in the Fourth Age of Middle-earth, so I'll tie on to your post. JRRT tells us
      that Celeborn went to dwell in Rivendell with other High Elves after Galadriel departed
      with Frodo and the others. Also, he indicates that the Eldar or High Elves are the only
      elves able to choose to depart Middle-earth. The Lesser Elves do not have that choice. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FF00FF">Being a writer and researcher for YE's Middle-earth
      (and a Tolkien devotee of many, many years) I'm a great one for quotes. So here are some
      references. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FF00FF">Regarding Celeborn after Third Age, from Prologue of
      LOTR: &quot;It is probable that Meriadoc obtained assistance and information from
      Rivendell, which he visited more than once. There, though Elrond had departed his sons
      long remained, together with some of the High-elven folk. It is said that Celeborn went to
      dwell there after the departure of Galadriel; but there is no record of the day when at
      last he sought the Grey Havens, and with him went the last living memory of the Elder Days
      in Middle-earth.&quot; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FF00FF">Regarding elves departing Middle-earth, from JRRT's
      Letters: &quot;But the promise made to the Eldar (the High Elves - not to other varieties,
      they had long before made their irrevocable choice, preferring Middle-earth to Paradise)
      for their sufferings in the struggle with the prime Dark Lord had still to be fulfilled;
      that they should always be able to leave Middle-earth, if they wished, and pass over Sea
      to the True West, by the Straight Road, and so come to Eressëa - but so pass out of time
      and history, never to return. The Half-elven, such as Elrond and Arwen, can choose to
      which kind and fate they shall belong; choose once and for all.&quot; Letters, p. 198. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FF00FF">&quot;If you or I or any of the mortal men (or
      hobbits) of Frodo's day had set out over sea, west, we should, as now, eventually have
      come back (as now) to our starting point. Gone was the 'mythological' time when Valinor .
      . . existed physically in the Uttermost West. . . After the downfall of Númenor, and its
      destruction, all this was removed from the 'physical' world, and not reachable by material
      means. Only the Eldar (or High-Elves) could still sail thither, forsaking time and
      mortality, but never returning.&quot; Letters, p. 186 </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FF00FF">The Lesser Elves (as opposed to the High Elves) are
      the people of Northern Mirkwood and of Lórien. Letters, p.176 </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FF00FF">on elves again: Since we are very concerned to
      preserve the integrity of Tolkien's Middle-earth, I've been doing very careful reading. So
      if you'll humor me, I'll just pop in another couple of quotes. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FF00FF">When Gandalf spoke to Aragorn after the defeat of
      Sauron, he said: &quot;For the time comes of the Dominion of Men, and the Elder Kindred
      shall fade or depart.&quot; I take this use of the term &quot;Elder&quot; to refer to the
      High Elves. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FF00FF">And in Appendix A, Tolkien writes: &quot;At the end
      of the First Age the Valar gave to the Half-elven an irrevocable choice to which kindred
      they would belong. Elrond chose to be of Elven-kind, and became a master of wisdom. To him
      therefore was granted the same grace as to those of the High Elves that still lingered in
      Middle-earth: that when weary at last of the mortal lands they could take ship from the
      Grey Havens and pass into the Uttermost West; and this grace continued after the change of
      the world.&quot; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FF00FF">At minimum, though, there is evidence that elves
      continue to dwell in Middle-earth, which is the important point. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FF00FF">A small footnote: I read somewhere in the HOME that
      Legolas and Gimli had special permission. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FF00FF">Jay Esparza on character actions: Sitting is in for
      now. Running is also in. Laying down has not been decided but swimming seems a little
      difficult. An interesting idea though. Maybe we should consider it. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FF00FF">on character options: no one on this team has
      decided NOT to use ents and eagles. We currntly have conceptual art for both. The wizards
      are another issue. I'm not at liberty to say how wizards will be used or even if that has
      been decided. </font></p>

      <p align="left"></i><font color="#FF00FF">Critters (what we call every NPC person or
      monster in the game) use the same exact character sheet as the player does. The one thing
      we can't add to them is PERKS or TRAITS. And we can't increase their level, so all
      critters in the game are level one - in essence. However, we do have control over their
      armor values, hit points, melee damage, critical chance, Action Points, and sequence.
      Basically a critter has two pages for a character sheet, one just like the character, and
      another where we can modify those kinds of things. For example, the stats will determine
      how many action points the critter has, but on the second sheet we can add or subtract

      can run the NID you have a chance, though the main game will run slower (more on screen
      etc). &quot;Barely playable&quot; was the comment from one of our programmers. Emphasis on

      <p align="left"><small><font color="#FF00FF">When Farmer first started working on
      Interplay's titles, he realized how different sound for games is from sound for motion
      pictures. &quot;I was really surprised at how complicated the whole process was - it was
      almost like starting over,&quot; Farmer said. &quot;Our biggest challenge was to make
      large sounds for smaller speakers. We're used to using huge theater-quality speakers, and
      we had to find a way to use different frequencies to make sounds to imply size without
      just turning up the volume.&quot;</font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#FF00FF">EFX Systems, who employs both Farmer and
      Harry Cohen (STARSHIP TROOPERS, BLADE) along with DSP will do sound for the

      original Fallout(tm) game as well as STAR TREK(tm): Starfleet Academy(tm). Weddington

      dangerous in BG, you are walking down a hallway and before you know it, you are surrounded
      and under attack. It can work both ways though. In dungeons there are ample opportunities
      for this one. There are lots of narrow hallways and corners to hide in. Take one,
      unencumbered character (thief is preferable) to act as &quot;bait&quot;. Send him/her up
      the hallway to investigate. Hide in shadows (if possible) and get in amongst a group of
      baddies. Surprise the heck out of them (become visible etc.) and make a mad dash back to
      where your party is waiting at the other end of the corridor (make sure you are being
      followed). Have a good area effect spell ready to go, lightning bolt really shines through
      here and cast it down the hallway. It bounces (if aimed just right) back and forth down
      the hall , cooking everything in it's path (so make sure everyone is clear). Bam, a group

    Mordor 2 that you guys may want to snuggle up to. Wow, sounds like he had a real good

      of my lifeblood, electrocuted, strapped, radiated, and excavated (what can I say, it was a
      REALLY exciting weekend for me), I got my final test results back from the hospital today
      and... it looks like I'm going to live! In fact, everything came back normal, so they have
      no idea what the problem is (well, I HOPE I'm going to live). However, I'm still feeling
      'under the weather', so there are still a few more things to check out. Perhaps my diet of
      Gatorade and Ensure is helping (yes, I know all of you wish you could eat like I have been
      for the past week). Now, if anyone mentions T-Bone or Pizza, I go hysterical and break
      down sobbing. What can I say? At least Ensure comes in multiple flavors. When they asked
      me what I did, I said &quot;game development&quot;, and they kind of looked at each other
      with a strange expression while nodding their heads. Hmmmm... Needless to say, I am
      feeling better, and slowly getting back into the swing of things. I hope to be back into
      programming full bore by Thursday, and will keep all of you updated as to the status of
      0.993b. Thank you to everyone who sent EMail and electronic &quot;get well&quot; cards --
      I really appreciate it!</font></p>

    Looks like another fresh day for RPG news so sit back and relax while I make some music.
    Saw over at Gagames that the new Front Page 2000 will be coming in 99!! That defenitely
    excites me! I also need to get around to pre-ordering Trespasser and Half Life today.
    October, one of my favorite months, not to mention a&nbsp; bundle of games getting
    released this month too?! Plus I just did a massive Archive so this page should load like
    a bat out of hell now. Also check out those Populous shots over at VE...they look real
