      Just got a whole swak of them sent off to Interplay, and they will be doing with them
      (whatever they do with em&#146;) and hopefully posting them shortly. Just cleaning up
      directories today. Old BG stuff, kinda sad to see some of this stuff go (not nearly as sad
      as happy to get rid of the stuff tho). We have to keep a lot of the data on the server
      because of the mission pack. There is like 40+ gigs of just BG stuff on the server that we
      won&#146;t be able to get rid of until the mission pack ships. Our network admin is
      getting kinda grumpy as the other projects here gripe about their lack of space ?.
      Continue to compile a features list for BG2, I have hundreds of E-mails, memos,
      suggestions etc. from ALL over the place. Trying to put it together and making heads or

    <blockquote>
      <i><p></i><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Mr. NoName, your point
      regarding the Phase Spiders is an important one and valid. To my knowledge, this specific
      issue is not addressed in the upcoming patch (though I am admittedly out of loop, as patch
      issues are being dealt with by others higher up the design chain). </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The issue of when a creature
      'sees' you and when they don't is more complex than it first appears, however. The final
      battle, for instance, would lose a lot of significance if the party could simply sneak in
      and obliterate the end boss (sorry, no spoilers here, people) before he could get a word
      in edgewise about you, about himself, about the nature of the past you have inherited. The
      city of Baldur's Gate would be a meaningless maze if Scar did not approach you upon
      entering and lend you at least a small degree of guidance. There are countless similar
      examples. For reasons such as these, we made the decision we did regarding the initiation
      of dialogue with hidden characters. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Unfortunately, that meant
      treating hidden PCs in a very specific way in the code. While my grasp of programming is
      severely limited, it is my understanding that reactions to hidden PCs were divided into
      two basic categories: combat actions (which are specifically dealt with under the AD&amp;D
      rules) and dialogue actions (which, being a lot more amorphous, we treated as a default
      setting of sorts). As you have seen for yourself, the 'phase' action of the Phase Spiders
      (and a number of other things that have come up in discussion of this string) was never
      transferred from its classification as default action to that of combat action. This is,
      indeed, regrettable. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">As for using the girdle of
      femininity / masculinity to get past the assassin, what a wonderful idea and I, for one,
      am kicking myself for not having had the forethought to accomodate such creative
      problem-solving into that specific subplot (although, would Khalid and Jaheira still have
      recognized you?). On the other hand, there is simply no way to program each and every
      character in the game to have separate dialogue for you being of a different gender (or
      having taken the form of a wolf, a bear, a squirrel, whatever) than they expected. As it
      was, the text dump for the game was roughly 450,000 words (the equivalent of two or three
      good-sized novels!), all of which had to be translated into a variety of different
      languages. There simply was not time, space, or money for such an undertaking. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">That in mind, those of us in the
      design department have put some serious thought into how to improve the issue of when
      creatures 'see' you. Hopefully you will be getting a taste of that when the proposed
      sequel is released (and no, don't ask me when or even if -- I haven't a clue and won't for
      quite some time... =) Some of our thoughts have involved reversing the default settings in
      the code and allowing you to walk past most dialogue encounters undisturbed. We would then
      give specific override scripts to those carrying plot critical dialogue. In this way, we
      hope to make the unfortunate bending of the rules the exception, rather than the norm. If
      that is the case, however, we do intend to make some further design decisions to
      compensate for this new strength of Stealth (no more going into stealth mode in the middle
      of bright sunlight when standing in front of a neutral character who you have every
      intention of backstabbing, for instance. *wink*). </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">So, until then, enjoy the game
      and remember that, in all your armor and with the sweat of countless adventures clinging
      to your unwashed back, are you at all surprised that the people and spiders know you're
      about? ;) </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">All the best and I hope this
      clears at least a few things up </font></small></p>

    <small>Those wacky cats over at The Firing Squad have gone off the deepend and poked up a
    bit of <a href="http://www.firingsquad.com/games/odium/">Preview</a> lovin on Odium. Now
    here is a game with some potential. Believe me, these guys <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>better

    <blockquote>
      <i><p></i><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Of course, what's a game
      without combat? As far as we can tell, exploration and combat in Odium are seamlessly
      mixed in the game play, just as it is in Baldur's Gate or Diablo. You'll not be whisked
      away into a different interface in order to fight monsters as you would in say, Final
      Fantasy 7. Those kinds of interruptions can give a game that &quot;choppy&quot; feeling,
      which the developers do well to avoid in Odium. With the seamless transitions from
      exploration to combat and back, players can focus more on plot development. This kind of
      commitment to the story is also evident in how Odium handles important transitions in the
      game. When you run into a &quot;boss&quot; monster, or trigger some other key part of the
      game, the camera angle will change or zoom in to give you a different view of the
      environment. It also helps inform you that you have in fact reached an important part and
      you should pay closer attention. </font></small></p>

      wield at first level. This is so they can swing both fists. They can also wield 1hB and
      2hB weapons. After about 10th level though, they do best hand to hand. If you don't work
      on your hand-to-hand skill prior to that, you'll be one sorry monk.</font></small></p>

    <p align="left"><small>Here he is on PvP Spells affects and NPC.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Spell damage will not be altered
      based on the PvP setting of the target or caster. It functions identically whether against
      monster or person. PvP battles in EverQuest will be primarily against people who want to
      fight each other, or, a balanced group against some lone wandering PvPer. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Yes, group balance is important
      in PvP as well. Keep in mind though, it will be easier to kill a player of a given level
      than to kill an NPC of a given level. The NPCs have way more hitpoints and hit harder.</font></small></p>

      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">There will most likely be what we

    <small>Well, Looks like Sharky Extreme just slapped up their <a href="http://www.sharkyextreme.com/games/lglass_systemshock2_g/">First Look</a> at System
    Shock 2. Here's another game that's <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>got everyone's Underwear
    bunched up</strong></font> like only a good Bull Ride could do. Stop by and check it.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">First things first,
      System Shock's engine now looks about as trendy as an 80s Escada suit complete with
      shoulder pads. Yes it's really aged that much, we're sorry to say. In an effort to bring
      the game bang up to date, Looking Glass will be using a modified version of the Dark
      engine, which was actually the 3D engine used for Thief: The Dark Project (which was
      plum). The engine can render in full 16-bit color (no 32-bit has been mentioned as yet)
      and will take full advantage of the current crop of 3D graphics accelerator cards (no
      surprises there then). A full array of special effects will be ever-present including,
      colored lighting, variable translucency objects and (everyone's favorite) particle effects
      for explosions. Basically the game should look nothing short of drop dead gorgeous. </font></small></p>

    Quests</strong></font></a><a href="mailto:sacrates@voodooextreme.com"><small> - Sacrates</small></a><br>
    <small>Stephen Nichols was on the boards dishing out even more info on how quests etc will
    be handled in Middle Earth. By the way kids, don't even <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>start
    expecting this title any time soon</strong></font>. We're talking late 99 for a possible
    Beta and then early to mid 2000 for full release.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">You will not gain money in
      Middle-earth through quests alone, but through trading with others and participating in
      the economy in any way that suits you. Middle-earth will definately be quest based
      however. While you can increase your skills through practice, you will not gain any new
      abilities based on those skills without finishing quests. If you want to learn how to make
      a new piece of armor, you will need the appropriate skill level AND be taught how to craft
      the item from a NPC. We want to provide both a free form environment for the hard-core
      players AND a more structured goal oriented environment for the casual player. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">It will also not be possible to
      be 100 times more powerful than a newbie. We are being very careful in considering all
      gameplay elements to keep the standard super-high-level-killing-machine syndrome out of
      Middle-earth.</font></small></p>

            for me to do? Kick in some Baldur's Gate damnit! Everquest is incredibly addicting yes,
            Tribes also has that same quality. BG does the same in all respects. All I know is that
            these 3 games alone will keep my gaming needs filled to the brim for some time to come.
            Before Christmas I was incredibly hyped for this stuff to come and now that it's here all
            I can say is that they all meet and exceed their expectations.</small></small></font></p>
