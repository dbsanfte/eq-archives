    <small>Those boys and girls over at VN have kicked up an<a href="http://www.vaultnetwork.com/features/interviews/ultima.shtml"> Interview</a> with
    Rich Vogel about UO, it's first year and what's to come. Personally I think<font color="#FFFFFF"><strong> UO has come a long way since it began</strong></font>.They have
    done a slap up job keeping that beast up and running.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><strong><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Jonric: What do you feel
      went well during the year? Were there any pleasant surprises? Did anything not go as well
      as you would have liked? Were there any unpleasant surprises? </font></small></strong></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Rich Vogel: That the crafting
      skills and home ownership were so well received by our players was a pleasant surprise. We
      feel strongly that ownership and identity are vitally important traits in an online game
      and we think UO did a good job supporting those characteristics. On the other hand, we had
      to learn simulations are not always &quot;fun&quot; in a gaming environment. There is, of
      course, a balance. You can design nice systems that give a game elements of simulation but
      are still fun for the player. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">With the economic and ecology
      systems, we found we had too much simulation. At any given time, we have a lot of players
      in the game, and as these players hunted creatures in the old system, they would often
      force many areas to become extinct because the ecology couldn't support the traffic. This
      frustrated players since they could not always get the raw materials they needed. We also
      found that players wanted NPC shopkeepers to buy items from them at reasonable prices even
      if the item is not in demand. Although that's not realistic, it's frustrating if you are
      unable to get money for excess equipment. But these examples are all a matter of course,
      and part of the challenge and excitement of learning how to develop a successful model for
      online gaming. The only truly unpleasant experience was the lawsuit. The team felt that it
      was unjustified and that frustration really lowered morale. It was like working with this
      dark cloud hanging over our heads..</font></small></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">&quot;<font size="2">Ok.
      Here's the deal with the new screenshot. The monster is called the &quot;Rumbler&quot;. It
      is a kick ass monster and looks great in action. I can't tell you what the monster's
      background is yet, as it touches a little to much on the plot. Please don't worry about
      cheesy, over-done FPS plot stuff- we got your back! The reason it is a dark screenshot is
      two fold. One reason is that the area the screenshot was taken in has not had a final
      lighting pass (I havn't put all the lighting in that area of the level yet). The second
      reason is that the hallway is dark anyway- but it shows up a lot brighter in the actual
      game (as compared to the screenshot). I think it's also a problem with the screen capture
      software (showing up to dark). Anyone know of a kick ass screenshot program (one that can
      take screenshots with a Voodoo card would rock)? I hope this helps out a little. I'll talk
      to ya laterz... &quot;</font></font></p>

    <small>Well, as all of you know by now we (The U S of badass A) are affectively at War
    with Iraq now. Personally I thought it was about time. If any of you have read The Cobra
    Event by Richard Preston you'd understand why. I <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>nearly lost
    it a few times</strong></font> while reading this book. Anyway, I also recieved a copy of
    Heretic 2 from Activision today and am affectively impressed. My first impressions are
    smooth graphics and they did a kick ass job with the Q2 engine. You can expect a review of
    this Mofo and Thief soon. Sit back, relax, make some Popcorn, watch a few Iraqi buildings

    playing chimps. This time they go into High level playing in the world. Here's a blurb.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"><small>In the world of EverQuest lies a
      continent of massive proportions. Its name is Antonica and it's the largest landmass one
      can explore in all of Norrath. Chris and I have been gallivanting around Antonica's
      countryside for quite some time now, and we know we've only begun to scratch the surface. </small></font></p>
      <p><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"><small>There are so many players amassed
      in key locations that overpopulation is becoming a problem. But, the size of the dungeons
      and towns is not the problems; there's plenty of dungeons and monsters for everyone.&nbsp;
      The problem is many players aren't going to other locations because A) they don't have
      enough information on how to get there or what creatures dwell there, and/or B) it's just
      too far for them to travel. But, as population increasingly becomes more of a problem at
      local dungeons such as Black Burrow (located on the outskirts of Qeynos),&nbsp; more and
      more adventurers will say &quot;enough is enough,&quot; and move on to more advanced
      dungeons such as Paw (located South of the Karana Plains - about a 15-20 hike from
      Qeynos). Here, they will find new creatures, more wealth, less player population, and of
      course, more danger. </small></font></p>

    <small>Looks like a possible release in<font color="#FFFFFF"><strong> December before
    Christmas is starting to look a little glum</strong></font>. I have seen a few things that
    would make me speculate on this as much as I don't like to. First is this little letter
    that some people recieved from Digital River regarding the release date which Greg said is
    untrue:</small></p>
    <font color="#e3cead"><blockquote>
      <p></font><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">We have just been informed
      by Interplay Productions that the release of Baldur's Gate has been delayed, and it will
      not be shipping until the first of the year. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Sincerely, </font></small></p>

      Senior Customer Service<br>
      Digital River, Inc.</font></small><font color="#e3cead"></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p></font><small>Next is this statement made by Greg about them not releasing any new info
    on the boards until Friday.</small><font color="#e3cead"></p>
    </font><blockquote>
      <font color="#e3cead"><p></font><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">I
      want to make sure that people are not staying up all night waiting by the web site. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Without going into anguishing
      details over contingency plans, production schedules and the like, I just wanted to tell
      people that there will be NO news until Friday morning. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">We will be prepared to give
      everyone and update then. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Sorry this is a non-note, but I
      am being totally honest. NOTHING will change between now and then - so no one will have
      special news, etc. Wait to hear from us Friday. </font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>This leads me to believe that they are going into some sort of evaluation of
    their status and assessing the situation. I think on Friday we may be getting an official
    statement on another possible delay until the 1st. As much as they, and we don't like it.
    Now don't go and flame me, because this was strictly a hypothesis on my part and is only a
    guess.<font color="#FFFFFF"><strong> It looks like they are defenitely thinking about
    something over there</strong></font>. It may be the release and it may be a delay. I sure

    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0"><small>Moving a box out
      from under a stack of boxes was one of the reasons we decided to implement a physics
      system that allows objects to rotate. Objects in Ultima 8, in contrast, could only slide
      around, since the art was done as 2D sprites and the collision system only worked with
      cubes.<br>
      <br>
      Although Ascension has a rudimentary physics system, it isn't the focus of the game and
      doesn't have all the features of a physics-based game. Barrels are really polygonal rather
      than round, so they don't roll all that well. Pivots aren't designed into the system as
      currently implemented. However, objects do react and rebound when they hit, and float or
      sink in water depending on their weight and volume.</small></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left"><small>Here's some from Jaccl on the monster AI.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0"><small>Several of us are
      currently working on honing creature AI. As far as magic creatures are concerned, there
      are a variety, some of them are smart, some of them are not. The smart creatures will use
      their resources in an intelligent fashion. There are definitely 'mages' in the game thou

      &quot;Right&quot; demo (People got the wrong impression from the demo we showed at E3), we
      will keep working on it. We will let you know as soon as we have the answers.</small></font></p>

      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">We are going to do
      our best to keep plot holes / NPC holes out of the game. We have some experts on the
      problem (Craig Bowlin, Chuck Zoch) who have worked with conversation systems on many games
      before. We have already started going through the story, and each of the designers is
      taking extra time to wipe out problems.</font></small></p>

      want to touch this one... Yes, you will need to use both the mouse and keyboard for
      combat, although we believe that what we have come up with works very well, and is not
      arcade-like. IronFury was correct about real time vs. turn based combat. We have spoken
      about this quite a bit, and I have no new information to pass on. When we finish combat,
      I'll give an update, and take your questions.</small></font></p>

    <small>I missed this blurb yesterday from Mahrin Skel over at EQ Vault in their EQ
    Guidebook. He go's over the<a href="http://www.eqvault.net/guidebook/adventuring/classes.shtml"> advantages and

      <p><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">Warrior: </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">989 says that &quot;Warriors are
      the masters of armed combat, in all its many forms. They are at home on the battlefield,
      and are trained to take punishment as much as dole it out, so their Hit Points are the
      highest of any class.&quot; </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">I say that Warriors are just
      about the easiest class to play. It's straightforward, you walk up to something and start
      hitting it until either it falls down or you have to run away. If you play with a
      spellcaster in your group (highly recommended you have a magi and a clerical caster), you
      use Taunt and try to keep all of the mobs focused on you. You get a wide selection of
      toys, can wield almost any weapon and wear nearly any piece of armor. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">Warriors are built to dish out
      and take punishent in melee battles, and they do it well. However, if you don't have a
      Cleric along, you spend *outrageous* amounts of time sitting on your tail between fights,
      regaining your health. If you don't have a Magi caster along, you wind up chasing down
      &quot;runners&quot;, praying that they die before they reach reinforcements.</font></small></p>

      we are stealing code and concepts from other games wherever and whenever we can. I am now
      convinced that Anox will have the richest, fullest world that the game community has ever
      seen, and have high hopes that our fourth programmer, who we will announce in January,
      will help us deliver the story with the highest performance and the broadest hardware

      the game has slipped in and out of production more times than a foot in a sock during the
      three-year soap opera that has been its development. No matter: there finally appears to
      be a light at the end of the tunnel. With wrangling over the direction of the series
      subsiding and the venerable Lord British now at the helm, it looks as if this latest

      as a thief. What's not to like about that character type? You get to pick locks, sneak
      about in the shadows, attack from behind, and so on. It's all very exciting and romantic.
      I'll bet you've even fantasized about being a thief in a medieval world, the feel of rough
      granite walls against your fingertips, pressed deep into the shadows, breathing slow and
      steady as you plot your silent dash from shadow to shadow just as the castle guard turns

      years of mockery over &#145;hotspot detector&#146; gameplay, even the most lucrative
      sources of quality graphic adventures have seemed to focus their interests elsewhere.
      LucasArts tackled the more lucrative action realm &#150; admittedly very successfully with
      Jedi Knight. More recently, Blizzard dropped their Warcraft Adventures project. And
      Interplay placed development of Secret of the Vulcan Fury into &#145;deep freeze&#146;.
