      Change the game difficulty to Easy before you do it if you're having trouble. That will
      give you a +20 to all non-tagged non-combat skills. If you have a 6 Int. you can tell him,
      &quot;Well he wants to be sure.&quot; If you fail that, then if your strength is greater
      than 7 you can try and bully your way in (but you'll run the chance of pi*sing him off.)
      If you're smart (8+), you can make a second attempt &quot;Look, he had me...&quot; and
      you'll get a +20 to your roll, but again run the risk. Best to keep trying the first

    I also got to play this puppy and thought it was spectacularly fun. The thrill of flying

      tell you &quot;just how good&quot; it really is. In single play you play as Rynn following
      a storyline that will keep you on the edge wanting to see what happens next. Find NPC's

    <small>Well this is a typical Sunday alright. Anyway I thought I would rant a little more
    on some of the games that have gotten my attention lately. Blood 2: Goddamn this is fun.
    Plain and simple. The character animation is by far some of the best I have seen in an FPS
    yet! It is SMOOTH! Does it contribute anything to the RPG genre? Hell no but I enjoy it.
    Trespasser: This game is so open to interpretation my Grandma would probably enjoy it just
    by sitting off in a nice little meadow and having a picnic. (<font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>That
    is until the Raptors come along and get medevil on her ass</strong></font>!). You can play
    this game any way you want to. One word....addicting. It almost makes you want to restart
    the game and see if you can complete it with another style of play. Does it contribute to
    RPG's? Hell yeah! The physics alone are something I am sure we'll be seeing in future
    games more and more. It's good to see game companies still being agressive and cutting
    edge. Good first try Dreamworks. Now just bring the patch out and fix some of these bugs!
    Shogo MAD: One mother of a story!! Finally we are starting to see FPS games evolve from
    mindless shooters to virtual experiences. This game comes close to what Half Life will
    eventually do and that is break down the barriers between genre's. Half Life, Like
    Trespasser can be defined under multiple catagories yet it's still a shooter at heart.
    Anyway back to the subject. Populous: Surprise! Graphically an awesome acheivement here.
    Gameplay is strong and<font color="#FFFFFF"><strong> how can you possibly not enjoy
    watching these little fellers kick and beat each other to a pulp</strong></font>? Right
    now these are the games that have my attention, everything else is just details. If I had
    an RPG I would toss it in here too, but alas this isn't so. Ironic that nearly everything
    we cover here is still not out yet. (Other than Fallout 2)</small></p>

    <small>Was over at Billy's place and noticed that Riva 3D just smacked up a <a href="http://www.riva3d.com/kq.html">Preview of Mask of Eternity</a>. It's good to see the
    King's Quest series really evolving this way. You know the crazy thing is that nobody is
    having a tissy fit over this? Yet when U:A was announced to have the new perspective <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>everyone's underwear got bunched up </strong></font>and the bitch
    slappin started. My personal opinion is that all things should evolve and the Ultima
    series should not be an exception. It's time to move forward instead of staying with tried
    and true 2D engines. Yeah they are tried and true, but this industry always has been and
    always will thrive on evolution. After seeing both of these games at E3, I can honestly
    say they made the right decisions.</small></p>
    <font face="Verdana" size="2"><blockquote>
      <p></font><font color="#8080C0" size="2" face="Bookman Old Style">The strength of this
      game presents itself in many aspects: character and camera control, 3D engine and effects,
      voicing, story, and attention to detail. Character control is accomplished by both the
      keyboard (movement, actions, etc.) and mouse (picking up or examining objects, interacting
      with the environment, camera movement). Conner can walk, run, swim, jump, climb, push,
      throw, shoot and fight, using little more than the direction arrows on your keyboard and
      the mouse. Other keys are occassionally used (for example, the END key toggles between
      running and walking, the INSERT key is used for jumping, etc.), but overall, the controls
      are kept simple to maximize your enjoyment of the game. Simply walk up to an object, and
      if it can be moved, Connor will bend down and push it. If you go into deep enough water,
      you'll swim. This control makes it very easy to start playing without having to memorize a
      bunch of key combinations. Battle is also straightforward. Pick a weapon, point at your
      foe and click, with the SHIFT key allowing alternate attack moves. Moving the mouse with
      the right mouse button moves the camera, and allows you to zoom in and out, pan, and look
      up and down.</font></p>

    <small>Ok today is absolutely dead. Quick rant. Blood is exactly what it is. A pretty damn
    good shooter with great atmosphere. I would have to say this is a strong contender for my
    Credit Card number! One game that already has that (I have been playing a freinds copy
    until I get mine) is Trespasser. Yeah, it's got it's fair share of bugs, but underneith
    all that lies some fundamentally strong gameplay! It is unlike anything you'll ever play,
    you'll either hate it or love it. It is basically real life physics putting you on a
    strange Island with strange creatures. It just feels real and becomes considerably
    addicting. <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Have you ever pet a dead Raptors head? I have!</strong></font>

    trigger and it go's off in the Raptor's face.....thump. Little things like this, the game
    can be incredibly unpredictable. One things for sure....not everyone will like this. It is
    a simulation and not for traditional FPS fans. It's more Adventure than anything, just
    with action elements. Plus you need the beast to make it run. My PII 266 12 meg V2 64 megs
    of Ram is feeling the hurt. This game <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>opens a whole can of
    Whoop ass on your PC</strong></font>. Those are my 2 cents on the matter. Anyway if we see
    anything we'll spit it your way. </small></p>

    <small>Yup, even more Trespasser Review goodness. This game is <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>seriously
    getting some big time Press </strong></font>lately? I have seen Reviews on nearly every
    type of Site imaginable. Here's a piece off a review done by Quake City that I totally
    agree with. They have a Review posted <a href="http://www.quakecity.net/trespasser.asp">here</a>.</small></p>
    <font color="#276fa1" face="Verdana" size="2"><blockquote>
      <p></font><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style" size="2">I've been reading some
      of the reviews floating around the 'net of DreamWorks Interactive's Trespasser. I think
      many people have misinterpreted the intent of this game, and are unhappy with it based on
      unfounded expectations for it to be a first person shooter like Quake or Quake II.
      Trespasser has created a new genre, closer I would say to virtual reality than any
      existing 3D action game. </font><font color="#276fa1" face="Verdana" size="2"></p>

    <p></font><small>Also along the lines of Trespasser Review goodness are a few others. PC

      random encounters: </font><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Not really. We
      automatically pick the shorted route. Because of the terrain type waiting, this almost
      always involves road travel and therefore the least nasty of the random encoutners. The
      only time that you wouldn't want to do this is if you are looking for nasty random
      encounters. If this is true, then you should just travel between far away wilderness
      areas. <br>
      <br>
      Time for last second adjustments (Not those kind): You generally get enough time to set
      your party in a formation, before the monsters arrive, although you won't want to spend
      too much time on the inventory page.<br>
      <br>
      </font><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080FF">On Random Encounter locations:</font><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"> The random encounter areas are quite small. Some
      are nice and open, but some require you fight your way past the monsters. You can thank
      James for those :) <br>
      You drop into one several different random ecounter areas. You will have to pick up any
      items before you leave, because scavengers will find your stuff and take it. Honest, not
      because we don't save changes to random encounter areas, it was scavengers :) . I'm not
      sure if you can rest before leaving. This was disallowed at one point, but that may have
      been changed after game testing. (Oh no! I used to know how everything worked. It's just
      too big, too big .... Aarrrggh!!!)<br>
      <br>
      </font><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080FF">On graphic adjustments:</font><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"> There is no remove tree top option. Since the
      graphics are all unique, this would have required us to double the number of CD's. We do
      have a dither creature and object option. When this is on, all objects are dithered by
      obstructing objects instead of being completely obscurred. <br>
      <br>
      By the way, this what the folks at SirTech have done in the JA2 demo. We didn't know that
      they were doing it, and I doubt that they knew that we were. I guess, simular problems,
      simular solutions.<br>
      <br>
      </font><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080FF">On Character graphics:</font><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"> You can change your character's portrait,
      sounds, and colors at any time. We weren't going to let you do this, but the play testers
      said it should be allowed.<br>
      <br>
      When you dual class you get the character animation appriate that would be used if you
      were the multiclassed. This is because there is no armor animations for mages etc.<br>
      <br>
      You are never penalized for plot related events.<br>
      <br>
      </font><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080FF">Combat etc: </font><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Terrian definitely effects missile combat. Since
      you have to dodge trees and boulders, it does take longer to reach the archer and
      therefore the archer gets more shots in. As far as trees and other obstructions, an archer
      will either move or wait until he has a line of sight to the target before aiming and
      firing. Dodging around trees and buildings, does hamper an archer's ability to hit you. Of
      course while you busy dodging, the rest of the party is being slaughtered. Ah, decisions,
      desisions.<br>
      <br>

      dead or resurrection. This is because none of the play testers were using raise dead or
      resurrection. When asked why, they said the constition penalty made it not worth while.
      They just reloaded every time.</font></small></p>

    <b><i><blockquote>
      <p></i></b><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">3D Characters<br>
      In this weeks news update we're going to discuss one of Revenant's most important
      features, the 3-D characters. As you may know by now, Revenant features 3-D characters
      instead of the sprite based characters that are common to tile based games. 3-D characters
      offer many crucial advantages over sprites. Two of the most important advantages to 3-D
      characters are lighting effects and animations. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Lighting Effects:<br>
      One of Revenant's visual features is a colored lighting system that rivals those seen in
      games like Quake 2 and Unreal. These lights are more than just eye candy however. As your
      character walks through dim caverns he is concealed in darkness. Walking into a pool of
      torchlight will illuminate your character with an orange-red glow. You can use this method
      to conceal yourself in the shadows while avoiding the lit areas. This is a major part of
      Revenant's stealth mode, but that's another news story for another day. For now just
      imagine walking across a low bridge over a glowing green swamp, your character bathed in a
      translucent green light. Imagine a cool blue color lighting your character as they step
      into a moonlit glade in the forests. All the 3-D characters in Revenant from the players
      to the monsters to the NPC's will all be effected by the colored lighting. From a visual
      standpoint it's damn impressive, from a gameplay standpoint we have two words for you...
      Kick Ass. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Animations:<br>
      Choosing 3-D characters over sprite based characters gave us a huge amount of flexibility
      with our character animations. Our main character alone features literally hundreds of
      animations ranging from weapon swings, spin kicks, picking up objects, talking, walking,
      running, sneaking, throwing,.... Well the list goes on and on. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The NPC's also benefit from being
      3-D characters. You won't find any static characters &quot;just standing there&quot;. Walk
      into the &quot;Drunken Whore Tavern&quot; and you'll find the barkeep Rubold wiping down
      the bar, pouring mugs of ale for the patrons, and walking around keeping the place tidy.
      The bar patrons will be drinking mugs of ale, playing darts, falling over drunk, arm
      wrestling, etc. You'll even see Misthaven's resident &quot;woman of the night&quot; Kylie,
      dancing suggestively on a table at the center of the bar. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Then of course, are the monsters.
      Not only can we give our monsters a multitude of attacks, blocks, and interactive power
      moves (not to mention the spell and projectile attacks) but we wanted to do something
      more. Too many games have the enemies standing around waiting for the player to arrive.
      You won't find much of this in Revenant. Coming upon our monsters you will see them
      sleeping against walls, feeding on hunks of meat, fighting each other, patrolling back and
      forth across crucial areas, talking to each other, and much much more. This type of
      flexibility would simply not be possible with sprite based characters. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">In the next news update, we will
      discuss the dialog and NPC's.</font></small><b><i></p>
