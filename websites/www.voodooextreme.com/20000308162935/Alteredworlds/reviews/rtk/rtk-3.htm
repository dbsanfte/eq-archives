    <p align="center"><img src="rtk-box.jpg" alt="UO:T2A" WIDTH="190" HEIGHT="232"><br>
    </p>
    <p align="left">Each character has 5 attributes - Strength, Agility, Stamina, Reason and
    Charisma. For the most part what you see is what you get...other than magical influences,
    each character's attributes are fixed throughout the game. You then have the skills that
    define your characters - Spellcasting (broken up into 6 paths; 4 for mages and two for
    priests), combat skills (again broken up into unarmed, bladed, two-handed etc.) along with
    defense and initiative (how fast you attack), Theifly skills, Alchemy, and several other's
    that determine how well you can asses items and people or notice ambushes. Each character
    has a running total of experience you gain from killing enemies, which goes towards
    raising you to the next level of your trade (Thief/Warrior/Mage/Priest). Every time you
    gain a level, you are given 100 points to distribute amongst your skills (assuming you can
    use that skill - thieves can't cast spells), and increased hit points.</p>
    <p align="left">Bumping up your skills works on a sliding scale...it's far easier to
    advance at a lower skill level than when you have almost mastered that art (skills top out
    at 100, not including magical bonuses). Very high scores in skills have corresponding
    benefits - high combat skills will give you extra attacks in combat, while higher
    spellcasting skills give you access to higher levels of spells. I think it would've been
    nicer to see spells available to buy or find, instead of this wait to go up a level so I
    can get some new spells approach. I never did see the top levels of priest magic, as I
    didn't get to 100 skill before the end of the game. All in all it's a good system (kind of
    a scaled down version of the Fallout 2 characters system), but I did find, especially with
    James who is almost always in your party gaining experience, that you can max out the
    important skills fairly easily.</p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#8080C0">Pick Locks/Disarm Traps Skill</font> - I thought
    this was very well done. You have the option of either going with the dice roll, where
    anytime you want to open a chest or pick a lock the game simply checks your skill to
    determine success, or actually role-playing out the process of disarming any traps and
    then picking the lock. You have 5 tools for lockpicking - a probe, for determining what
    traps (if any) are present, a lockpick (for finally picking the lock once any traps have
    been removed), and 3 tools that you use to try to remove the actual trap. You use the
    probe to determine the three parts of the trap...the trigger, the main mechanism, and the
    delivery method. When you click on one of the 3 parts of the trap with one of the tools, a
    gear like dial will pop on screen. The bottom of the dial has a gold colored success zone,
    that varies in size according to the appropriateness of the tool you selected. The inner
    dial then spins around, the speed based on your skill level, and you try to stop the dial
    pointing inside the gold zone. It may not sound like much, but it does add a lot to the
    game.</p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#8080C0">Alchemy</font> - I've heard a lot of people complain
    about the alchemy system in RtK. Personally, I found it, well, useless. Literally. I
    played through the entire game without making a single potion. Not saying that I didn't
    use any potions, I just found 3 times more potions on bodies than I could use. In all
    fairness, I did go back and play with the alchemy system the second time I was playing. It
    is an interesting and unique system, and the ability to make some of the rarer potions (I
    love strong fire Oil :) does make some of the fighting go a lot easier, especially on a
    harder difficulty setting.</p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#8080C0">Stealth/Perception</font> - ??? Do these skills
    actually have any effect on the game? It's really hard to tell. The only time I noticed
    any possible effect from either skill is once you have left Krondor and you are making
    your way through the forests of The Kingdom. You do get notices on screen about ambushes,
    and some combats will have your enemies approaching from ridiculous distances, instead of
    the more common stones through away.</p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#8080C0">Assess</font> - Get one character to build this
    skill up fast :). If you can't identify an item accurately, your only other option is to
    sell it to a shopkeeper and then buy it back. There is no &quot;identify for a fee&quot;
    option anywhere. And since you are paying roughly double to buy back what you just sold so
    it could be identified, finding out what that 45,000 gold magic plate armor really is gets
    expensive.</p>
    <p align="left">The inventory system works fairly well - a paperdoll type display for your
    character to equip weapons and armor, an unlimited number of slots to store everything
    else in your backpack, and an encumbrance system to make sure you aren't lugging around a
    dragon on your back. Every character has a set amount they can carry, and the amount they
    are carrying is displayed as a percentage of that total. It's a good idea not to get too
    much over 75%, as you can start loosing attacks in combat.</p>
    <p align="left">It's also not a good idea to get too overloaded as some chapters in the
    game find you unable to get to a shop to sell your goods. This does get kind of annoying
    when you have to spend 10 minutes picking and choosing through your backpack just so you
    can carry that nifty new sword you picked up. The only other major problem with the
    inventory system is the stacking of multiple items, or rather the lack of it. The only
    items that stack in your inventory are arrows and alchemy reagents. It's more annoying
    than anything else, but scrolling over a hundred or so potions every time you want to get
    to the one item you need gets old quick.</p>
