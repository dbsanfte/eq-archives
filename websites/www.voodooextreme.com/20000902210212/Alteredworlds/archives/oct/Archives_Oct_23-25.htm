    <small>Steve Nichols had a few things to say on the Middle Earth boards tonight which were
    especially interesting. Noticed this little Piece over at VN that is something I have been
    wondering myself. It's about signing out just before dying and what happens. (It's called
    doing the Diablo)</small></p>

      <p><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0"><small>We're still not 100 percent
      decided on this issue. I'm currently leaning toward the side of allowing the NPC engine to
      take over your character after logout in a dangerous situation. Of course, the problem
      then is how to make sure that our combat AI is good enough to not kill ya every time. ;) </small></font></p>

      would be a P266 with 64MB or RAM... with this setup it would be personal preference as to
      whether you use a hardware accelerator or not. I have to be careful recommending a
      specific 3D accelerator. It seems every blasted chipset and driver has something they do
      that makes it 99% compatible... notice the number is not 100%, and they have a tendency to
      release updates (which is better than the alternative. We'll have a list of specifics

    <small>Whoa, what's this? Is it....could it be....News!!! Sweet fresh scented Baldur's
    gate news. In this occasion I am actually happy these guys are pimpin out the info.
    Anyway, I was over at BG Chronicles and noticed Scott Greig slapped up a few tidbits for
    your viewing pleasure. Check it.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <font color="#e3cead"><p></font><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0"><small>We
      have just finished our first semi-complete French and German builds of Baldur's Gate!!
      They are about 80% translated and have about 90% of the translated voice files. It's
      really weird after playing the english version all of these months to suddenly have your
      favorite characters talking in a different language. We are still hoping for a concurrent
      international release, but there are always last minute problems to contend with. So
      hopefully, the European fans won't have to wait months after release for the game to show
      up in their stores. </small></font></p>
      <p><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0"><small>In case you are wondering, the
      first batch of localizations will be French, German, and Spanish (with complete translated
      voice acting) and Italian (with partial translated voice acting). There may be other
      language translations, but these will follow after the first batch is released. </small></font></p>
      <p><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0"><small>Regarding censorship: We only had
      to make a few changes since the requirements have been relaxed over last few years. I
      strongly doubt that you could even tell what we did to the game, even after playing both
      versions. Let me put it this way, we were running the censored version in the office for
      about a month before anyone noticed.</small></font><font color="#e3cead"></p>

    tonight. Oh well, you know we have our sites set for some good incoming so keep checking
    back. Anyway, was out doing the Sacrates thing with the woman at the movies. We scoped out
    Soldier, which turns out to be slightly worse than a Gilligan's Island remake. You could
    strap me down and force me to watch Love Boat reruns and I would enjoy it more than I did
    this movie, and I LOVE Sci Fi movies! Do yourself a favor and wait for video. Well, i'm

    <small>Looks like the monkey boys working on Baldur's Gate have once again raised the
    Experience cap. Ben was on the boards spewing a bit our way on just this very subject.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <font color="#e3cead"><p></font><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">The
      experience cap has been raised even though the game has been finished WITHOUT reaching the
      cap. The testers were up in the area where they would not gain any more levels so there
      was no more reason to &quot;develop&quot; your character because they had reached their
      peak. The new cap is now...89000 XP. This does not mean much if you are a multiclass or
      dual class, but if you are a single class, it means an extra level. The cap does not
      affect the game's launch as the necessary spells already exist (with NPCs and on scrolls)
      although there is not a full rack of level 4 spells. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">On rolling, we have a instituted
      a minimum of 75 points. We basically sat down and decided where we wanted abilities to
      fall, so now you can't roll lower than 75 total. You can get acceptable rolls right off
      and high ones if you roll for a while. It's still not near as bad as it was before with
      the 4d6 drop the lowest method. </font></small><font color="#e3cead"></p>

      Australian release date: We're trying to get it out very soon, but I don't know if I can
      give dates yet. ;) It's still a little early for that. Check back with us next month.
      We'll have a very good idea by then. </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">on the exact North
      American release date: And I quote: </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">&quot;We are pretty
      sure that it will be shipping on 10/30, in the stores a day or so after that.&quot;<br>
      &quot;We will most likely have copies at the party to sell.&quot; </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">The chances are very
      good but not definite. </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">We didn't know
      exactly when we were really going to ship until Yesterday morning. That's One of the
      reasons we didn't give a ship date. We know that when it gets down near the end, the date
      is VERY flexible. </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">on the UK and German
      versions: We don't have a ship date for the UK/foreign versions. </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">The UK version had
      the same changes that Fallout 1 had. Kids are being removed and references to drugs are
      toned down. Besides those two things, that's it. </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">The German version
      will also have the same changes that Fallout 1 had. Violence levels will be removed as
      well as kids. </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">If you want an
      unaltered version, you must get a US version. No patches will ever be available since the

      No sorry. No dripping spears..... only shiny pointy ones. ;) </font></small></p>

      lives after the game is released: We have the opposite problem... Now we HAVE our lives
      back and we don't know what to do with them! ;) </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">on DirectX versions:
      DirectX 6 is the min requirements. If you try and use anything else, you're on your own.
      Since Fallout 1 ran on 5, you probably won't have a problem... but we've only been testing
      on DX6. </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">on alignment-related
      abilities: You will not do extra damage because of your alignment. You're probably
      thinking of quests and other events that are only available to certain characters: Karma,
      Repulation, Skill level, Character Level. </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">on the hint book:
      This hint book is a hell of a lot better than the one for Fallout 1. This one Matt Norton
      did, our lead designer, as opposed to a 3rd party company who's never played the game. ;) </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">on the connection
      with Fallout 1: Well, this is northern California.... So a lot of the events don't really
      affect Fallout 2. Whether of not you killed Necropolis, Boneyard, doesn't really matter...
      Of the things that matter, here's the scoop. </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">The path that was
      selected was the one most &quot;good&quot; characters would have picked. That would mean,
      The BOS is alive, Tandi was rescued and other &quot;good&quot; characters were not
      assassinated. This is a sequal that stands on it's own. </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">on NPCs: NPCs won't
      advance except for the Mysterious Stranger and Party Members. </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">The Mysterious
      stranger has about 5-6 &quot;versions&quot; which are based on your character's level. </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">The way party
      member's work is a little more complicated. Combat characters have 6
      &quot;versions/levels&quot; and non combat characters have 3-4
      &quot;versions/levels&quot;. They have a chance of going up when your character goes up be
      there are a lot of conditions. Some party members won't start advancing until you reach a
      certain level. </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">Sulik is the first
      party member you have the chance of joining your party. He has a base level requirement of
      6, so you have to be level 6 before he will have a chance of advancing of advancing to his
      &quot;2nd&quot; level. Before he can go to his 3rd level, your character must be at the
      next level requirement. </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">Sorry, if this isn't
      making sense. ;) </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">on random
      encounters: Let me see if I can do this again, without confusing others or myself... </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">The higher your
      outdoorsman the better chance you have of avoiding a random encounter. If you make your
      outdoorsman &quot;roll&quot;, you will be prompted with &quot;Do you wish to encounter
      (insert name here).&quot; Followed by Yes or No. This way you have the choice or encounter
      it or not. </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">If you fail your
      outdoorsman roll, you will be forced into the encounter (like normal.) </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">Like Fallout 1, your
      Perception will determine how close you appear to your &quot;guests.&quot; The higher your
      perception, the further away you will appear from them. The lower your perception, the
      closer you appear... to the point of being surrounded. </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">Some areas of the
      world map will give your outdoorsman skill a negative modifier, making it harder to avoid
      random encounters. </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">Hope that helps
      some. </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">on party member
      skills: Some party members have Key Non-combat skills that will aide the player. </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">If the NPC, who's
      key skill is outdoorsman, has a higher outdoorsman than you, his/her skill will be what is
      checked when doing your outdoorsman roll. </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">There is also a

      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">On why your archer's won't shoot
      other party members: Maybe so, but in P&amp;P and in RL you are dealing with a MUCH larger
      &quot;playing field.&quot; You have a couple-hundred yards to fire your arrows before your
      frontline is in ANY danger of being hit. In BG, your view is smaller and your fighters are
      always RIGHT THERE. You cannot arc a shot over their heads either; they go right through.
      Yeah, firing into a melee should be dangerous, but in BG you would see your archer's
      usefulness drop through the floor. Gameplay issue. Too much reality in an unreal setting =
      bad. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">On how the guards just
      &quot;appear&quot;: Talk about a coding nightmare. Having the guards walk from location X,
      crossing areas and entering houses etc. would be a lot of work for something you would
      rarely see. Man-hours on that are not really worth the effect you would get. As for your
      thief, the guards do not IMMEDIATELY appear. There is a delay (albeit a very short one)
      wherein you &quot;hear the guards being summoned&quot; in which you can attempt to use
      your handy stealth/hide in shadows. You succeed, the guards appear but they cannot see
      you. You get out before they find you and you suffer no reputation hit. Scot free baby!
      You could also duck upstairs or out the door, but you had best be quick about it, and if
      you go upstairs they will be downstairs where you were for some time (in case someone
      returns to the scene of the crime, as it were). Hide and sneak back down. Thieves can get
      away rather easy if they are skilled, so the corresponding penalties are unfortunately
      quite severe. Maybe you can bribe the guards, thought most you can't. Maybe you can
      backstab them, though the reputation of a guard-killer drops like a rock. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Only gnomes can be multi-class
      specialists (in fact, it is their only option as a mage multi-class). Other races are
      restricted to the basic mage in a multi-class. Humans can dual-class a spacialist though. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">When you change to a new class,
      your old abilities become &quot;dormant&quot;. You then progress just as a normal single
      class version of whatever you have changed to, gaining proficiencies and abilities like
      normal. EG: if you were a fighter with 3 proficiency slots in large swords and
      dual-classed to a thief, your fighter abilities would shutdown and you would choose new
      proficiencies as a thief (one slot in large sword only) with new first-level
      proficiencies. Once you were one level higher in your new class than your old, your
      fighter class reactivates and you then use whichever proficiencies were better. They
      overlap, and you would use the 3 instead of the one. They don't add together. You can
      never improve on your old fighter abilites, but you don't lose them (well, you do for a
      while). </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Mages cannot use shields. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Clerics and Druids AND their
      combinations with other classes are forever restricted by the ethos they must follow.
      There are huge danger signs on this class on the dual-class screen too, because if you
      start as a fighter and dual TO a druid, you LOSE any and ALL proficiencies in weapons
      restricted from the druid. You have mastery in large sword and dual to a druid? Say
      goodbye. Even when your fighter class reactivates you won't be able to use them. They are
      gone for good, and the slots are lost. No chance to switch them around. Ahh, the harsh
      restrictions inherant in hearing &quot;the call.&quot; </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The PCs carry out your
      instructions as soon as they are able. If they are currently in the middle of a
      &quot;round&quot;, then they must wait until they have the opportunity to do something
      else. They can always walk around/change positions/run away and such, but a character that
      has begun to swing his weapon, cannot swing at a new target until his next round begins. A
      mage cannot start a second spell until the round in which he cast his first is over. This
      time delay between actions will still fly by if you are fighting multiple targets with
      multiple characters. You'll be pausing at least occasionally. Pausing does not reset the
      rounds, nor does changing their actions. </font></small></p>

      Master - level 6 Fighter <br>
      Grand Master - level 9 Fighter <br>
      </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Yes, you can specialize in more
      than one weapon group. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">You cannot leave the character
      creation screen without spending all your weapon proficiency points. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The mission pack is a plug-in for
      the existing game. Your character will not change. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Each character is a separate
      creature. It's not like Might and Magic wherein you are a four-headed beastie that is
      never without your fellows. Your characters can separate as far as the current area allows
      (as much as 8 screens by 8 screens, bigger than it sounds). You can send lone characters
      into most buildings without the rest of the party. Some areas are party required, but
      these are usually major encounter areas or entrances to larger areas (dungeons, etc.). The
      guys you have left alone are always just a click away. Select their portrait and you are
      centered on them. If you do leave them to fend for themselves (ignoring/phone/potty
      break...tsk, shoulda paused) and a monster happens by, they will act according to the
      script you have selected for them. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Basically, when you first create
      a character and when your first get an NPC in your party, they have the basic
      &quot;respond if attacked&quot; script by default. If directly assaulted they will do
      something, not always the best thing, but something. However, on everyone's character page
      there is a customize button, which allows you to change their scripts. There are plenty to
      choose from and they are grouped according to class. You can have your fighters attack
      anything hostile that they see and follow it until either they or their target is dead, or
      you can have them draw their bow and attack hostiles until teh enemie closes, at which
      point he will switch to his sword and go toe to toe. You could also have him only fight
      creatures that are attacking the weakest party member, or never go far from the party
      leader (there are more as well). Thieves can do this as well, plus automatically try to
      backstab (and more as well). Clerics can be told to fight as best they can, but if anyone
      drops below 1/2 hit-points they will heal them. They can also automatically dish out the
      offensive spells. Same for mages (and more). Basically, the party is as effective on it's
      own as you wish it to be. The scripts could likely take you through a lot of simple
      fights, though the tougher ones would overwhelm them. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Major encounters are placed
      including their items. Smaller encounters are randomized somewhat, though you will never
      get that superduper sword of doom from a wandering monster. You gotta work for the good
      stuff. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Lots of us are hardcore AD&amp;D
      fans, but Lead Designer James knows it backwards and forwards. We all have to to some
      extent. Without it, we couldn't spot the subtle bugs (like a completely bitched THACO
      GRRRRRRERSRAFRDRE...fixed though. Smiles everyone, smiles). </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Boxes are done, manuals are not.
      But don't benchmark against the Fallout2 materials. Baldur's Gate is very different (The
      manual is 160 pages, for example).</font></small><font color="#e3cead"></p>

    daily dose</strong></font></a> <a href="mailto:sacrates@voodooextreme.com"><small>-
    Sacrates</small></a><br>
    <small>In what is becoming commonplace, we have a ton of U:A info flooding in from Sith
    once again. This is an absolute beautifull thing seeing the programmers starting to give
    feedback on the game! Here is Bill Randolf (Lead Programmer and mack daddy) laying some
    smack down for us. </small></p>
    <i><blockquote>
      <p></i><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">I cannot say whether a
      specific numerical quotation would be possible. It would be, of course, loaded with risk,
      if we were to add a feature later to the engine that would slow it down, for example.
      Right now, we're in a phase where we're speeding things up to as fast as they can possibly
      go. But, as we add more and more features, the engine will runmarginally slower. Another
      factor that makes frame rate quotes difficult is the huge amount of scalability in our
      engine. Our lighting model has many levels of scalability. You can also adjust your far
      clipping plane in &amp; out to change the number of objects &amp; polygons in a scene.
      And, we're adding Levels of Detail. We're doing everything we can to allow you to crank up
      the fidelity, if speed is your gig, or crank up detail, with some performance degradation.<br>
      <br>
      And, still another factor is the variability of our world. Frame rate varies depending on
      your location in the world. And, it also varies depending upon how many creatures are
      around you, and how much stuff you've carried from other locations in the world and dumped
      around you. There's little to stop you from collecting a huge amount of items &amp;
      slowing the game way down, if that's your choice...<br>
      <br>
      And, finally, I'd have to avoid saying anything that might cause us to be compared to
      games of completely different genres, such as Quake or Tomb Raider. Those products address
      completely different play styles from Ascension, and have inherently different performance
      issues.<br>
      <br>
      So, about all I can say is that, if you play on the &quot;recommended platform&quot; with
      hardware acceleration, your frame rate will be fast enough for it to not detract from the
      immersiveness of the 3D world of Britannia!</font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left"><small>And if that's not enough here is Audball bitch slapping us with
    some goods on the sound! This gets my Willy Wonka Wonkavating for sure since I recently
    purchased the SB Live as most of you know. </small></p>
    <i><blockquote>
      <p></i><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">It should still sound good
      and immersive (you'll still get DirectSound3D). To offset the lack of EAX support in
      non-CL products, our Audio Engineers are pre-processing some environmental effects with
      reverb and whatnot. We will play them as 2D sounds (EAX only works with 3D sounds, so
      playing them 2D will ensure they sound the same on every system, with or without EAX) and
      they should help the game's ambiance quite a bit.<br>
      <br>
      We might also use a second set of pre-processed audio samples for those sounds which would
      benefit the most - things like footsteps or events that you hear often. If we detect that
      you don't have EAX, we could play sounds from that special set of SFX; if you do have EAX,
      we would just play the &quot;normal&quot;/non-processes FX and let EAX do it's thing.</font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left"><small>And one more from Bill on the Physics model in the game.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Things DO fall at precisely 9.81
      m/2^2 in our world! Although, visually, it looks like they're moving too slow. But I've
      checked &amp; rechecked the math. It's just a visual illusion. Perhaps other games modeled
      a stronger gravity to make it look right...<br>
      <br>
      We do support moments of inertia in our physics system; objects do have a center of
      gravity, different from the geometric center. Objects have mass.<br>
      <br>
      Our physics system does support buoyancy. And, crates float lower if they're full. But, I
      don't know if the design will incorporate this feature.<br>
      <br>
      Signs, hanging herbs, and other objects swing in the wind in our world; but, surface-area
      forces aren't modeled.<br>
      <br>
      Our engine does not support having an axe stick in a door &amp; letting the Avatar pull it
      out. And, not just any item can be picked up--only those that make sense to pick up.</font></small></p>

      all, lest you feel too abused, we're really talking about half-elves here... no other
      demi-human race can multi-class with Ranger or Druid abilities. (Consistent with AD&amp;D
      rules) </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">There are 5 possible multi-class
      half elf combinations that concern this conversation: </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Fighter / Druid </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Cleric / Ranger </font></small></p>

      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Fighter / Mage / Druid (not
      applicable for BG) </font></small></p>

      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Ranger / Druid </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">So if you REALLY wanted to play
      multi-class with a Druid or Ranger these are your BG choices. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Now I am departing from
      'official' AD&amp;D rules and commenting generally upon the decision to not allow Druid or
      Ranger dual classing in Baldur's Gate. (These are my personal opinions) Note also that I
      am saying Baldur's Gate only (in terms of the original game). No one has decided ANYTHING
      relative to additional BG products (expansion packs or whatever). </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Given that a Druid or Ranger is
      really only interesting at higher levels (where their special abilities come into play), I
      would NOT recommend ANY of these multi-classed characters. If you multi-class with a
      Druid, for example, you are writing off the ability to shape-change in the game (you will
      never reach level 7) and you will have significant weapon restrictions (Druid weapon
      restrictions take precedence (as Priests) over all other weapon restrictions). So what
      would be the point of being a Fighter/Druid, or a Ranger/Druid? (Imagine being a
      Ranger/Druid and not being able to use a bow, for example). The only combination that
      would seem to make sense to me would be some sort of Mage/Druid... but why would you want
      to do this when a Mage/Cleric would offer so much more flexibility? Likewise a
      Cleric/Ranger... I really have an issue (personally) with the idea of Rangers that can't
      use bows... just remember that any Druid class comes with significant weapon restrictions
      and any Ranger class comes with significant armor restrictions and you'll see what I
      mean... </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">So I guess while I COULD see a
      very cool dual-class 7th level Mage / 8th level Druid, it simply isn't going to happen in
      BG... if you REALLY think through the AD&amp;D rules, and think through the allowed
      possibilities, a BG dual-class character along these lines doesn't make a lot of sense. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">You'd be better off developing a
      7th level Ranger and dual classing in a BG expansion... </font></small></p>

      think though....) </font></small></p>
