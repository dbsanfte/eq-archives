    <p align="center"><em><small>Sacrates gives it to you turtle style&nbsp; in this new
    Interview filled to the brim with&nbsp; exciting 3D RPG goodness. Him and Chris Norden get

    <blockquote>
      <font SIZE="2"><p><font color="#8080FF">Sacrates:</font> Let's get this out of the way
      first, Introductions. Self explanatory here, please feel free to let the Altered readers
      out there know who you are and what the hell you&#146;re doing.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font color="#8080FF">Chris:</font> OK&#133;My name is Chris Norden and I&#146;m the
    Lead Programmer and Assistant Director on Deus Ex. I do lots of programming and pulling
    all the different parts of the game together (art, sound, levels, etc.) Before ION, I
    worked at Origin (<u>Jane&#146;s Combat Simulations AH-64D Longbow</u>), and Looking Glass
    Austin (a bit of work on Thief: The Dark Project and lots of work on an unnamed project
    (R.I.P.) using the Thief technology)</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font color="#8080FF">Sacrates: </font>So here we are talking about Deus Ex, (Or going
      to talk about it) but let's skip a few beats and jump to the end first to get
      everyone&#146;s interest. What is Deus Ex going to offer us that other games in the genre
      can't? </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font color="#8080FF">Chris: </font>Deus Ex is going to be an extremely immersive
    role-playing experience. There&#146;s going to be lots of character interaction and
    development, problem solving, exploration, discovery, and of course combat. We&#146;re
    striving to make Deus Ex a lot more interactive than most RPGs out there in that
    you&#146;ll be able to solve problems like you would in the real world, not just like the
    designer had in his mind. Solutions to problems will fall out of what you carry with you,
    who you talk to, and your immediate (and not-so-immediate) surroundings. How you interact
    with (and react to) your environment can be very different than how your friend would act
    in the same situation.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font color="#8080FF">Sacrates:</font> Ok so now that you've explained why Deus Ex is
      gonna make a few gamers happy, let's see what's under the hood that makes it tick. The
      Unreal Engine. Ooooh Aaaah. (Single player response) Projectile vomiting (Multiplayer
      response) What is this engine doing for your lives to make it less complicated? (And
      possibly more complicated?) </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font color="#8080FF">Chris: </font>The Unreal engine has made our lives much easier
    than I ever would have imagined. Tim Sweeney and the Digital Extremes guys have put
    together an amazingly flexible engine that can easily be adapted even to complex games
    like Deus Ex. We&#146;ve had to add lots of different &quot;RPG&quot; things (like a
    conversation system and editor, a highly realistic combat system, a windowed user
    interface, etc.), but the fact that the original engine is so flexible has made our jobs
    much easier. The level editor (UnrealEd) is also the most complete level editor that I
    have ever used (and I&#146;ve used quite a few). The real power of the editor is not just
    in editing raw geometry, but how all of the game data is so cleanly tied into the overall
    level. I&#146;d hate to think where we&#146;d be if we didn&#146;t have the Unreal engine
    as a starting point.</p>
    <p>Also, you&#146;d better suck down that projectile vomit that you were just
    spewing&#133;Tim and his crew have totally rewritten the networking systems for Unreal,
    and the performance is excellent. That&#146;s another one of the great things about
    working with the Unreal engine&#133;when the public or the licensees have a problem or a
    suggestion, Tim listens and does his best to make improvements to the engine.</p>
    <p>Now I know this sounds like a lot of pro-Unreal sucking up, but I can&#146;t even
    calculate how much time we saved in the prototyping stage. We&#146;ve had almost all of
    the major game systems up and running in a playable form for quite some time
    now&#133;it&#146;s done wonders for our designer-programmer feedback loop. Even now, as
    the systems are being implemented in their &quot;final&quot; form, we&#146;re progressing
    very quickly for a game of this magnitude. Designers have a lot of control over their
    levels without having to interact with programmers or artists every few minutes for new
    data.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font color="#8080FF">Sacrates: </font>With those earlier questions said, are you
      adding enhancements to the Engine itself? Similar to what Half Life has done with the
      Quake engine. How much code are you going to retain and how much will be original? </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font color="#8080FF">Chris: </font>Well, we&#146;re adding quite a number of
    enhancements to the basic Unreal engine: better player and NPC damage models, more
    detailed and complex animation, more realistic physics, better NPC AI, much more realistic
    combat (using real-world and near-future weapons), player skills and augmentations, a very
    cinematic conversation system, a really slick user interface&#133;the list goes on and on.
    Our other programmers Albert Yarusso (Looking Glass - <u>British Open Championship Golf</u>)
    and Scott Martin (Sonalysts - <u>688(I) Hunter/Killer</u>, <u>Fleet Command</u>) are doing
    wonders to get all these systems working flawlessly with the engine. When we&#146;re done
    with the game, you won&#146;t be able to tell that it&#146;s based on the Unreal engine.
    Deus Ex is most definitely NOT just a big TC (total conversion.)</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font color="#8080FF">Sacrates: </font>How is gameplay handled within the Engines
      framework? Is it going to be level based or will it be chapter based etc. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font color="#8080FF">Chris:</font> It&#146;s hard to say&#133;it won&#146;t be like
    anything you&#146;ve ever played. Technically, it will be level based, but you won&#146;t
    be able to tell when one level ends and where the next one begins. Everything is tied
    together using local and world maps, and the story pushes you along smoothly. There
    won&#146;t be a &quot;level complete&quot; screen with kills, secrets, and time. Instead,
    somebody (or something) may give you more clues that will lead you to a different
    geographic area with different goals and different people to talk to. You&#146;ll also be
    able to travel freely between certain locations even if it&#146;s not necessary to do so.
    Exploration is not discouraged and is often rewarded&#133;the cautious and perceptive
    player will have a very different experience than the trigger happy player. Deus Ex will
    be a very story-intensive game&#133;to get the most enjoyment out of it you&#146;ll really
    need to think instead of just blasting everything in sight. Of course, you could blast
    everything, but you will have a much more difficult time finishing the game when everybody
    around you is dead.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font color="#8080FF">Sacrates:</font> What kind of Interaction can we expect with NPCs
      in this game? Will it be large dialogue trees that we respond to or something akin to
      Diablo with prewritten responses. How deep can we expect NPC interaction to be?</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font color="#8080FF">Chris:</font> Almost all of the conversations will be short and
    to the point. We feel that large dialogue trees do nothing but confuse the average player,
    and we would rather tell a story than have a bullet point on the box which says &quot;over
    one million lines of dialogue to click on.&quot; Quality over quantity. Having said that,
    I think that our NPC interaction will be some of the most involving and interesting you
    have ever seen in a game. Part of playing an RPG is making choices&#133;some easy and some
    tough. The choices in Deus Ex will actually mean something. If a character asks you
    &quot;How do you like my store?&quot; and you respond by saying &quot;It sucks, old
    man&#133;and so do you!&quot;, he&#146;s not going to help you later on in the game. On
    the other hand, if you&#146;re polite to him, he might just give you a critical piece of
    information that would otherwise be a real pain in the ass to extract from some computer
    system somewhere else deep in the game (for example.)</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font color="#8080FF">Sacrates: </font>How many NPC's can we expect within the game and
      how good is your AI system? (Extremely popular question at the moment) Will the NPC's have
      a life of their own or will they be at set points throughout the game guiding the players?</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font color="#8080FF">Chris:</font> Lots, great, and yes.</p>
    <p>Currently, there are over one hundred unique NPCs in the game, and everybody will have
    something important to say to you&#133;not just &quot;Nice weather we&#146;re having.
    Yup.&quot;</p>
    <p>Licensees are not allowed to use all of the Unreal AI...most of it is Unreal-specific.
    So, Scott Martin has been working on our own AI system using the basic functionality in
    the engine as a starting point. You&#146;ll see some pretty complex NPC behavior like
    hiding, ducking, jumping, using objects, and opening doors just to name a few. All of the
    NPCs will react to the environment as well as your actions and the actions of other NPCs.
    They will be allowed to have a life of their own, but we still need to be sure that they
    are at the right place at the right time to keep the player on track.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font color="#8080FF">Sacrates: </font>How is the story handled throughout the game?
      Obviously Unreal did a great job with very small cinematic touches such as the Skarj
      meeting etc. Will you guys be telling Deus Ex's story through similar fashions of Cut
      scenes or in game sequences or scripted scenes? </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font color="#8080FF">Chris:</font> Story will be conveyed through NPC conversations
    and through in-engine scripted cut-scenes. You&#146;ll also get story information through
    various computer terminals, books, email, memos, etc. found in various places throughout
    the game. You will also learn from your environment and by investigating your
    surroundings. Why does this normal-looking office have a high-security lock on that door?
    What are those strange-looking tanks deep under the water? Why is this chick hiring people
    to kill me? And so on.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font color="#8080FF">Sacrates: </font>What can we expect in terms of character
      development? How deep can we go in that department?</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font color="#8080FF">Chris: </font>Expect lots of it. Your character will learn new
    skills (I won&#146;t tell you how many just yet) and acquire new items, weapons, and
    augmentations. What are augmentations you ask? I won&#146;t tell you that, either. There
    won&#146;t be traditional role-playing stats (like strength, intelligence, wisdom, etc.),
    but rather a more tangible distinction between the capabilities of your character and
    someone else&#146;s. I could play through the game developing my weapons skills, while you
    might play through the game developing your high-tech skills. Where I would use force to
    blast my way through difficult situations, you would tinker with devices and hack security
    systems. Or, someone could develop lots of different sets of skills to become a
    generalist, but he won&#146;t be really good at any one thing&#133;he&#146;ll just be able
    to do lots of things at a slightly higher level than a beginner would. It&#146;s totally
    up to the player as to how they progress through the game and overcome different
    obstacles.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font color="#8080FF">Sacrates:</font> How much of the game is action based and how
      much interaction? What can we expect in overall game structure? A lot of fighting to gain
      levels and experience so I can buy things or more adventure such as talking to people and
      completing quests etc?</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font color="#8080FF">Chris:</font> Well, it really depends on your playing style.
    We&#146;ve tried to balance the amount of pure action with the RPG elements, but the key
    here is that people with different playing styles will still enjoy the game in different
    ways. We have designed the game with an eye more towards conversation, world interaction,
    and exploration than just pure action, but the player will be able to choose how to play
    the game&#133;we certainly don&#146;t force you down the &quot;righteous path.&quot; Every
    obstacle has multiple solutions within the game&#133;here&#146;s a quick example:</p>
    <p>Player A will say &quot;Well, knocking didn&#146;t work, so I just blew the door off
    its hinges to get in, but then the alarm went off and the guards totally kicked my ass!
    Duuuuuude!&quot;</p>
    <p>Player B will say &quot;I used my lockpicks and my stealth skills to pick the lock and
    sneak in undetected.&quot;</p>
    <p>Player C will say &quot;It was easy! All I did was disable the security camera and
    rewire the keypad to trick the door into thinking I had entered the correct code.&quot;</p>
    <p>Player D will say &quot;I just put on an engineer&#146;s labcoat and used the security
    code that I hacked out of the mainframe. Piece of cake!&quot;</p>
    <p>Get the idea?</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font color="#8080FF">Sacrates: </font>So here we have little Johnny A with his
      tendency to enjoy well thought out adventure/RPG games and his brother, Little Johnny B
      who likes to kill things (On the computer of course) and see bloody massacres on the
      screen. How are you going to get both of these guys to enjoy Deus Ex? Or will it simply be
      aimed at a particular group of players like (Possibly) Johnny A?</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font color="#8080FF">Chris: </font>See previous 2 questions.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font color="#8080FF">Sacrates: </font>Speaking in terms of 3D technology and not
      Genre. What do you expect will be your most groundbreaking feature? What will separate
      this from a quickly oversaturating market and possibly take these styles of games to the
      next level? (ie. Trespasser with it's Physics, Half Life with it's story)</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font color="#8080FF">Chris:</font> Hmmm&#133;in my opinion, 3D technology has advanced
    to the point where everybody has pretty much the same feature set. Yes, we have
    &quot;portal technology&quot; and mirrors. Yes, we have procedural textures. Yes, we have
    colored dynamic lighting. Whoopdeedoo. However, all the technology in the world
    doesn&#146;t make a game fun to play. Deus Ex will have great technology AND be fun to
    play&#133;we use all of the technology available to us to enhance the overall experience.
    What&#146;s our most groundbreaking feature? I would have to say &quot;gameplay.&quot;</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font color="#8080FF">Sacrates: </font>Obviously we have heard the controversy
      surrounding the new additions to your team from Origin. (Bob White etc) How are these guys
      working out so far? </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font color="#8080FF">Chris: </font>They&#146;re working out great. Bob White, Dan
    Rubenfield, and Marshall Andrews all have extensive RPG backgrounds from Origin and from
    their childhoods. They are all totally dedicated to Deus Ex, and have brought some great
    new ideas and skills to our team.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font color="#8080FF">Sacrates: </font>How deep are you into development right now?
      What percentage is Deus Ex right now in it's Development stage?</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font color="#8080FF">Chris:</font> We&#146;re cranking right along. We&#146;ve got
    several maps done and our art department (with Jay Lee as the art lead) keeps amazing us
    with the awesome characters, objects, and textures. Programming is coming right along,
    also&#133;all of the major game systems are almost functionally complete, and we&#146;re
    working on interface and tweaking. Game scripting has been moving along as well, but
    we&#146;ll continue to work on scripting and tweaking until the day we ship. I can&#146;t
    really give a percentage complete&#133;it really is just an arbitrary number that
    doesn&#146;t have any real meaning. We will ship the game when it&#146;s fun&#133;I know
    everybody is sick of hearing that catch phrase, but it&#146;s really true.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font color="#8080FF">Sacrates: </font>Sound....an obviously overlooked part of gaming.
      Are you going to have 3D sound support like Unreal etc? Will you have dynamically changing
      music etc like Unreal and many of the others?</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font color="#8080FF">Chris: </font>I think sound has finally become a very important
    part of games these days. Looking Glass&#146;s Thief: The Dark Project is an excellent
    example of the use of sound to enhance gameplay. Sound will play a very important role in
    Deus Ex as well. Expect a rich and varied soundscape&#133;you&#146;ll definitely want to
    play our game with the volume cranked. There will probably be some music, but it will be
    more like ambient sound and location-specific music rather than a continuous techno-pop
    soundtrack played throughout the entire game. If you walk into a dance club, you&#146;ll
    hear dance music and loud crowd noise. If you walk into a bathroom, you&#146;ll hear water
    dripping and hard echoes. If you&#146;re outside at night, you&#146;ll hear wind blowing,
    crickets chirping, and the grass crunching beneath your feet. We&#146;re taking full
    advantage of everything that Unreal supports, including the latest EAX support from
    Creative Labs, so make sure you have a kick-ass sound system before Deus Ex is released.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font color="#8080FF">Sacrates: </font>A late comer question here regarding gameplay.
      How will combat be handled? </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font color="#8080FF">Chris:</font> Combat will be in real-time and very realistic.
    We&#146;ve got lots of real-world weapons (some taken right from the pages of Jane&#146;s)
    and some really cool high-tech weapons as well. There will be realistic hit locations and
    damage effects for both the player and NPCs. Don&#146;t expect to be climbing ladders if
    both of your arms are blown off. You&#146;ll be pulling yourself along the ground with
    your arms if your legs get blown off. A critical shot to the head will most likely kill
    you instantly, and a million shots to an NPC&#146;s hand will only piss him off, make him
    drop his weapon, and leave a trail of blood as he runs away in fear and awe of your
    immense power.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font color="#8080FF">Sacrates: </font>And last but not least a philisophical question.
      What's your take on the 3D industry right now? Do you feel it's becoming oversaturated or
      still in it's infancy? We see cutting edge titles like Trespasser and Half Life but
      between the lines we have a lot of titles that scream I am 3D..play me or die.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font color="#8080FF">Chris: </font>Argh&#133;this industry can be really frustrating
    at times. There are way too many &quot;me too&quot; titles out there that show no
    innovation in terms of gameplay. It&#146;s way too easy to license an engine and change
    some graphics and sounds and ship it...this scares me. All too often, all it takes is a
    clever ad and lots of marketing money, and your average uninformed consumer will buy it.
    Slap a famous name on it or hype yourself into the ground, and you instantly become
    visible to everybody. I won&#146;t mention any names, but you know what titles I&#146;m
    talking about. Let&#146;s face it&#133;the average consumer outnumbers the hard-core gamer
    by a huge number. However, there are still tons of great games out there&#133;I wish I had
    more time so that I could play all of the games on my list. It&#146;s games like Half-Life
    and Baldur&#146;s Gate that distract all of us from making our game.</p>
    <p>I don&#146;t care if you have the coolest graphic technology in the world, if
    there&#146;s no design and no gameplay, it will become little more than a cool tech demo.
    Don&#146;t get me wrong&#133;having good technology is essential to an immersive
    experience&#133;a solid engine can make a good game look great. However, a good engine
    will do absolutely nothing for a bad game other than take pretty screenshots for
    magazines. How many times have we seen renders or mocked-up screenshots that show nothing
    about the gameplay itself? How many times do we have to sit through a five minute long
    rendered intro cinematic only to be left saying &quot;Great, but what does this have to do
    with the gameplay?&quot;</p>
    <p>I&#146;m sure you&#146;ve noticed my continued use of the word gameplay throughout this
    interview. If you didn&#146;t notice, I&#146;m a big believer in substance over excessive
    flash. You still have to have a certain amount of flashiness to attract people, but in the
    end, it&#146;s the gameplay that keeps them coming back time after time. Gameplay is what
    Deus Ex is all about.</font></p>
