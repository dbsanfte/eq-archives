    a few goodies via mail. Just the usual stuff, <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Whips, chains,
    cherry flavored vasolines etc</strong></font>. (Couldn't get my heart into sending my
    Hampster collection) Anyway, Bowmeister slipped you some manly lovin of his own up in the
    form of some Lubed Banners. We have, I believe, a total of 11 new banners up for you to
    check out. There's even one or two in there that will make you &quot;one handed&quot; Web
    Browsers happy. Anyway I thought I'd stay at home and watch a nice love flick like
    Braveheart (Hey, it's as close as I get to one of those without being threatened with no
    sex for a week) to keep me in the mode. </small></p>

    <small>We'll have more news up later. I just got back from the courts and would like to
    dish up a little time in EQ on my continuing Altered Quest for big breasted naked Nymphs.
    Just had to slap up that Phase 4 status info which I thought fairly important and maybe
    would shut up one or two of the chimps that have been yakking their asses off in the chat
    room about it. Everyone thank Bowmeister for the new Banners! We've got some more tasty
    ones coming very soon too so keep checking back. There are 5 new ones hidden around in
    there so keep your eyes peeled. For those in Phase 4 now, look around for Tefe (Original
    name huh?) the Dwarven Cleric with an attitude. I hang around Butcher Block lately, feel
    free to give him a tap on his Dwarfly ass. On a related note to EQ, I saw yesterday while
    at the entrence to Kaladim a guy by the name of &quot;Alien&quot; get booted by Semiramis
    (EQ GM) for harassing other players and also having a non fantasy name. Now you see that
    the guys at Varent don't take your monkey shit kids. Congratulations Sony on having good

    <blockquote>
      <p><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"><small>I have stated this many times
      already... once more won't hurt. Our goal is to make a fun game based on the world of
      Middle-earth. Our goal is not to make a ultra-realistic simulation of Middle-earth. In
      some cases the rules of &quot;reality&quot; are broken to accomodate our genre of game.
      The global chat system is one such case. It is a necessary feature of these kinds of games
      that the public repeatedly request. I could continue to rant about how this is a game, and
      that people in real life have certain expectations for this type of game.... but I won't.
      Feel free to turn your global chat off and never use it. If global chat is going to make
      you not want to buy the game then I'm sure you'll find another game that suits you.</small></font></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"><small>There will indeed by day and
      night in Middle-earth. Sadly, the scale of the map forces us to have somewhat unrealistic
      day/night cycles. We are not setting up the day/night cycles based on the sacle of the
      map... to do so would have a full cycle every few minutes. Our current plans have the full
      cycle occuring every hour or so. We will balance this during beta to get the most
      comfortable timing.</small></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>Here's some goodies on Magic.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"><small>Here's the bottom line: Magic
      will exist in Middle-earth, just not in the way it exists in other D&amp;D style games.
      Tolkien has written a few tidbits describing the nature of magic in Middle-earth. Refer to
      letter number 155 in the book &quot;The Letters of Tolkien&quot; for more specific
      information. This letter states that &quot;magic&quot; is not attainable by Men, but the
      Elves and Istari use it (albeit sparingly). He specifically says that &quot;magic&quot; is
      not learned through lore or spells, but it is an innate ability. This entirely precludes
      the notion that men, hobbits or dwarves can cast magic spells. Now, Middle-earth does have
      an interesting flip side to this. The idea of scientific &quot;magic&quot; is worhty of
      note. There are many items that were crafted by non-magical races that had what appeared
      to be true magic (epecially to the unlearned). This opens the possibilty of many other
      kinds of lore based magic. This kind of &quot;magic&quot; will be the most popular. Those
      in the know will be able to craft all kinds of devices that perform different
      &quot;magical&quot; effects. Of course, that obviates the need for raw materials and the
      like (which the innate magic races don't have to use). </small></font></p>
      <p><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"><small>In any event, true magic will be
      used very sparingly and will be quite difficult to master. </small></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>Hre's one for you &quot;Questionable people out there.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"><small>No, there is no [animal]
      breeding.</small></font></p>

    <p><small>Etc.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"><small>When you enter a building, you
      will no longer see what is going on outside of the building. It will be treated like a
      separate map altogether.</small></font></p>

    Sacrates</small></a><br>
    <small>Here's Smedly, John that is, back with the goods on the current status of Phase 4.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Here's a brief update of where we
      are at: </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">1) Chat/ Login Server - We've
      basically got it stabalized. Early next week you WILL see the front end go directly to the
      Server Selection Screen, and there will be a chat option on that page. We had intended
      this all along, but for now, we needed to load test it AND make sure that we are seeing
      the problems that are occuring with people trying to get in. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">2) Problems with people who can't
      get into the chat server - We are seeing an isolated problem with some people who get a
      Black Screen upon logging in. We are looing into it, and we have some ideas. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">3) Problems with people locking
      up on the Loading Screen (Elf woman with the scenes behind her). - This sometimes occurs
      when a person get's kicked out of a zone because it crashes, or other reasons. We are
      debugging this problem. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">4) Problems with people locking
      at the character selection screen - this is a pretty rare problem. A couple of notes - If
      you are running a Monster Fusion - MAKE SURE you have the latest drivers. The older
      drivers have this problem, the current ones don't. If you don't have this card, make sure
      you have the latest drivers for your card. We are still looking closely at this problem. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">5) Sound Problems - We are aware
      of a sound crash bug - If this happens to you often, disable your sound card for the time
      being, but we should have this fixed really soon. This should be a pretty uncommon
      problem. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">6) Server Stability - We are
      working on several bugs in this area. We've fixed many already. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Overall, we are seeing things at
      a relatively stable place, with a few exceptions. The login/chat server problems we had
      early on were expected since we didn't have the load on them to test before. We are fixing
      the bugs as rapidly as we can and we will continue to do so. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">One last thing I want to mention
      is the restoration of characters. This is progressing as FAST as it possibly can. We have
      decided that resources are also needed to deal with tech support issues, so things are
      going a little slower then we would like. Please be patient.<br>

      <p><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"><small>If you are running a Voodoo 2
      card and have crashed when switching to 800x600, and now crash when entering the game,
      delete all of your .opt and .opt1 files out of your Everquest directory. These files are
      your 'options' which contain your screen setting, keyboard layouts, hotkeys, etc. Deleting
      them will kick you back to the default 640x480 resolution and allow you to get back in the
      game. </small></font></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Adrian Chmielarz, of Polish
      developer Metropolis, explained: &quot;Odium is one-third RPG, one-third strategy and one
      third-adventure. I don't think there's another game like this on the market. Let's say
      it's a mix of FFVII, Vandal Hearts, Fallout and X-Com. A new genre is being created and I
      think we'll see more hybrids like this in the future.&quot; </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Chmielarz continued by voicing
      the development team's intentions for the title: &quot;We're trying to do what Diablo did
      for action-RPGs. We took the best part from each genre. From adventure games, we took
      exploration and interaction with characters and environment, which not only puts the
      player into an active, role-playing part, but also enables him/her to actually influence
      story events. From RPGs we used the character development factor, and simplified the
      player's statistics, making every bit of data really vital and the data values (ie the
      value of accuracy) easily understandable and clearly visible during play. From the
      strategy aspect, we implemented battles which really make the player use his thinking cap
      just to stay alive and make progress.&quot; </font></small></p>

    Chat in ME</strong></font></a> <a href="mailto:sacrates@voodooextreme.com"><small>-
    Sacrates</small></a><br>
    <small>Personally I love this shit in EQ. Hell, even though the opening chat server has
    been <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>acting like a sexually deprived Nymphomaniac</strong></font>
    lately I still like that too. Here's what Steve Nichols has to say on that in Middle
    Earth.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">This point has been debated many
      times already. The simple fact is that we can not stop people from using an external chat
      program while playing Middle-earth. We can try to do so, like EQ, but all that would do is
      remove the use of such programs from the hands of the normal players. Anyone with some
      basic programming background could modify our client to allow them to use a program like
      ICQ. Then what we will have is a bunch of people subverting the controls that we have in
      the game (you know those &quot;hacker&quot; types, they're always sharing their hacks).
      This would mean that a select few people really would have an advantage over other
      players. For that one reason alone, we should embrace the idea of global chat. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The argument of realism when it
      comes to global chat does not hold water with me. It certainly is not realistic, but that
      does not mean it is not a viable feature that belongs in this game. Just the fact that the
      entire game is populated with phantom players (players who appear and vanish at any time
      and have no realistic life-cycle) breaks the entire realism paradigm. The fact that you
      are playing with other people from around the world obviates the need for a instant
      messaging system. Without global chat, it would be quite annoying to keep in contact with
      your on-line friends. Even if you put that aside, there's still a reason for global chat.
      Guilds! Imagine a guild that has 500 members. How could they all get together for a guild
      meeting? The current technical limitations makes meeting in-game impossible (or at least
      unplayable). A perfect solution is an in-game chat forum for guilds that allows large,
      moderated, group conversations. Of course, you might think that having pre-made virtual
      meeting halls would be a good solution... but not really. Imagine the huge crowding issue
      as all 500 guild members make their way to the meeting hall. It would take hours just to
      get everyone into the meeting hall... not to mention the nasty lag caused by so many. Even
      if you put that aside, you still have the issue of new-player help. What's more friendly
      than having a group of 30 people in a global chat channel waiting to answer your every
      question about the game? It's a great way to meet people without the annoying &quot;I'm
      too busy to chat.&quot; that you'll get from the standard adventurer in town. Global chat
      has many uses, not only to cover technological limits, but as an ease of use feature. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Global chat is not only a nice
      feature for players, but it is a necessary crutch to support our broken leg of technology.
      If we had the technology of the 24th century and could make Middle-earth holodecks then
      all would be perfect. Sadly, that's not the case. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">One final perspective. If you
      really don't think that global chat is a feature that lots of players would want (if not
      the majority), then why did UO add it to their major product upgrade? It's not a difficult
      feature to have... it's one of the easiest. They left it out of the original product
      because of their determination to stick to ultra-realism. It's my theory that plenty of
      players complained about the lack of such a feature and it got added to keep the customers
      happy. The bottom line is that Global Chat will not ruin the game for anyone who does not
      use it. If you leave it turned off, you'll never be bothered by it. That is a valid
      compromise in my opinion.</font></small></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Let&#146;s get right
      to one of the more difficult questions. In your opinion, is Lands of Lore 3 more of an
      Adventure Game or a Role-Playing Game? Even if the development team doesn&#146;t
      necessarily intend to create a game that is of a particular genre of games, players are
      going to quickly classify it as belonging in one genre or another. Many gamers who were
      fans of the first Lands of Lore game, Throne of Chaos, were disappointed with the fact
      that Lands of Lore 2 felt, in many ways, like more of a pre-scripted, linear, strongly
      story-driven adventure game than an open-ended role-playing game.</font></small></p>
