      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The plot of
      Anachronox is pretty amazing, and vivid if you want to slap words on it. The game is
      basically centered around the city of Anachronox, located within something called a
      &quot;Sender&quot; in space. What's a sender, you ask? Well, it's exactly what it sounds
      like. It's a big object in space, where if you get close to it, it will rocket you across
      the cosmos, faster than light. It &quot;sends&quot; you across galaxies. Obviously,
      something such as this would have became sought after by many different races because of
      its importance to space flight. Many wars erupted over control of the Senders. Now, in the
      present of Anachronox's universe, the many Senders are lucrative trade centers, and the
      hubs of galactic intermingling and culture. </font></small></p>

      in interface and graphic perspective. Like in MM6, you control a party from a first-person
      perspective (not exactly intuitive, but functional) and guide them around realistic
      terrain. Of course, given that W8 will likely be released close to two years after MM6,
      there are notable graphical improvements. First and foremost is 3D hardware support, with
      support for Voodoo, OpenGL, Direct3D -- all of the good stuff that gamers have come to
      expect over the last year or so. Sir-tech confidently proclaims that W8 will be &quot;the

      heated debate. I never thought COmmunication would spark the response that it has. Let me
      lay to rest yes you can run the Unknown and ICQ at the same time and they work. We do it
      every day. Ask the poeple we respond to, I always have the Unknown running in the
      background. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">We still not have not yet
      determined how and if global communication is going to be written in. Right now We do like
      the say and yell command that Xav came up with. Running a 3rd party software package is an
      option, but we are not 100% sure. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">To be honest I am fully against
      lobal communicaton but we can break down everyone post to a) We really need it B) We do

      about it </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">We are considering the following:
      Getting a 3rd party company to asisst us on creating a global chat communication system
      that we can window into the Unknown. It would be a window mode and would run ontop of the
      game. You can move the window change it size and even get rid of it. But the server that
      you chat with will be one all by itself. We are even conisdering placing it off our site.
      These chat servers would just be exchanging global communication. This would allow the
      guilds the ability to talk, and user talk globaly the bandwith will still come off your PC
      and not outside. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Just a thought </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">PS: Before you ask would it hold

      <p><strong><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Actually, we have not
      updated the FAQ because we're too busy MAKING the game to update the FAQ every day. </font></small></strong></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">: This is a recurring theme for
      the dev team. Let's take some examples: </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">: <strong>Permanent death. </strong>A
      lot of people were strongly against this for some stupid reason. So the dev team decided
      that they would have permanent death, but that it would be unrealistic permanent death, so
      that the few people who thought permanent death was a good idea would have some reason not
      to like their implementation of it. </font></small></p>
      <p><strong><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Yes, our system of
      permanent death is not created in the image of the real world. To do so would make
      permanent death far too easy to fall prey to without serious planning before every
      adventure. Now, while that may work for a perfect player like you, it most certainly would
      not work for the majority of players. If we truly copied the real world, you would die
      from the first arrow that sticks you in the head. While realistic, that would be entirely
      unfun for 90% of the players (myself included). </font></small></strong></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">:<strong> Character persistence.</strong>
      There's been a lot of support for this idea since it was introduced on this board. Of
      course, the dev team has hinted that they're looking at something kind of like this,
      except that it won't be true persistence. It will be persistence for just a few minutes,
      so that if you're being chased you can get caught before you disappear. This eliminates
      most of the advantages of persistence, but keeps the problem with being attacked and
      killed when you're offline. </font></small></p>
      <p><strong><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">You really seem to be
      quite clueless if you think that we're going to have every character that has ever logged
      into the game just milling about under AI control. Imagine, if you would, hundreds of
      thousands of players that really serve no purpose to others in the game. All they would do
      is eat CPU time and bandwidth. That kind of character persistence is just not happening.
      We'll just have to do with the temporary forced AI control. </font></small></strong></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">: <strong>Reputation.</strong>
      It's obvious that some kind of reputation system is needed to govern NPC behavior. So the
      dev team, instead of implementing a true system of character reputation indices, came up
      with this 'criminal flagging' concept under which reputation ranges from 'very, very bad'
      to 'neutral'. </font></small></p>
      <p><strong><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">You're not entirely
      correct here. I don't remember ever outlining our reputation system in detail on this
      board. Certainly, part of our implementation includes the idea of being a criminal or
      murderer. That's not the only impact, however. There is indeed quite a complex system that
      tracks your standing with different social groups and modifies NPC behavior appropriately.
      You are not just 'very very bad' or 'neutral'. I will not detail the system further at
      this time. </font></small></strong></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">: <strong>Global chat.</strong>
      Global chat sucks. I know that, you know that, the dev team knows that. There are a few
      people who insist that it's not that bad. So the dev team decided to go with
      not-quite-global chat, which is just as unrealistic but not as useful. </font></small></p>
      <p><strong><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Global chat does not
      suck. It will not ruin the game for you either. It is an easy way to contact friends and
      plan in-game activities without large amounts of travel. It's not realistic, to be sure,
      but it IS a feature that the masses will enjoy. Be sure to turn your Global Chat off if
      you don't like it. </font></small></strong></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">: <strong>Multiple characters. </strong>This
      turned into a classic Band-Aid Solution scenario. The idea of multiple characters was
      pretty well discredited when someone adequately explained the idea of &quot;one character
      per server&quot;. As with global chat, some people thought multiple characters would be
      useful if they weren't abused. As a concession to these people, the dev team came up with
      the truly brilliant idea of promising to allow multiple characters, on the same account,
      on the same server, and then trying to find all the ways that multiple characters could be
      abused and patch them with special-case rules. </font></small></p>
      <p><strong><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">We are planning very few
      &quot;special-case rules&quot; to handle multiple characters. While some of you are
      sticklers about this subject, I have to ask you to again consider the mass market. It is
      my experience that multiple people in a family play this kind of game. Not only that, but
      they like to be able to play in the same world to help one another to further their goals.
      We can't just say play on another server or buy another account if you want to play with
      your brother. That's just bogus. There will be people who use their multiple characters as
      slaves to one another. Most players will not make the time investment to maintin the
      abilities of multiple characters, so the need for other players in the game is not
      diminished.</font></small></strong></p>

    <p><small>He also did a bit of bitch slappin to a particular poster there who had one too

    get the meat of the interesting game related stuff.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">We are not trying creating a
      Middle-earth simulation, but a fun game for the masses. I want to foster roleplaying, not
      enforce it. The average man on the street is not a roleplayer. That's a sad truth. The
      game should adapt to each user to ensure that each and every user has a good experience.
      Each of our decisions are based on what will make the game fun for most players. Our
      permanent death system allows players to adventure regularly and , if properly prepared,
      avoid permanent character death; it also allows the player the EXCITEMENT of the
      possibility of permanent death if they are not quite prepared enough. This will foster
      group play in a major way. Our global chat, in-game email and bulletin board systems give
      the average player easy methods of staying in contact with friends. This is vital for a
      vibrant community to exist in a world where people are going to be so very nomadic in
      nature. Our reputation, karma and stolen property systems hold players responsible for
      their actions, providing both excitement for the criminal who is avoiding justice and
      giving a rock solid foundataion for security of other players. While you espouse that the
      world can govern itself, I say to you that it can not. This is a GAME, not a life for most
      players. I can't think of too many people who want to investigate murders and track
      criminals. Surely there will be some, but not enough to balance the number of violent
      players there will be. Most players will want to create a character and have adventures.
      So that is the way we are skewing our system. We have taken many steps that our
      competitors shy away from that will foster roleplay like no other game in this genre.
      However, we will not be focusing on the realistic nature of the gamepley. Our focus is to
      make a fun, fair game that is playable by the average person. To focus too much on
      realistic implementations would exclude the majority of casual players.</font></small></p>

      our characters are fully customizable. This means that just about every little detail is
      changeable. Everquest allows you to choose between less than ten faces per race and sex.
      Not only that, if you get a green shirt in Everquest and put it on, your character does
      not look any different. Your character's appearance only changes when to pur major items
      of clothing on. Therein lies the difference. We must create enough clothing options for
      each race and sex combination (8 althogether). This is quite time consuming and including
      all the monsters, it's quite a job for our animators to handle. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Our artwork provides us enough
      options so that we can indeed have Eldar elves looking very different from wood elves.
      Unique appearances will not be a problem.</font></small></p>

    I love the feel of the game.<font color="#FFFFFF"><strong> It just feels like your playing
    the old school RPG's</strong></font> with that D&amp;D atmosphere. Well, except for when
    it does that wacky hitching when you scroll! UGH! We need that 3D patch soon Bioware!</small><font color="#C1C1FF" face="Arial"><strong> </strong></font></p>

      <i><p></i><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The control in
      Baldur&#146;s Gate is less about actually controlling your party of characters than it is
      more about the game interface. The interface in Baldur&#146;s Gate is seamless, you have
      full control over everything your party members do, their marching formation, their use
      and organization of inventory items, and even customizable scripted artificial
      intelligence for your fellow party members. The player is also given full control over
      whether the game is real time or turn based, this is mainly just for combat. Fighting by
      yourself against a couple of skeletons in real time might be easy, but later in the game
      coordinating a few archers, mages and fighters against a pack of varied monsters is a
      different story, and the ability to pause the game and plan out your attack character by
      character is definitely useful. One of this reviewers' main bones of contention with this
      game is the AI scripts for your party members. More often than not if you let your party
      members abide by their scripts in battle they usually do what you DON&#146;T want them to
      do, or even just sit there and do nothing. The ability to make your own scripts is a very
      useful feature, but I feel that the majority of people aren&#146;t going to want to take
      the time to do this. </font></small></p>

    massive success</strong></font>. Even with it's flaws, this game is beyond massive and
    anything else attempted before it. This game kicks me on my lilly white ass every time I

      (Over 175,000 Units Sold Through In First Two Weeks)</b> </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">IRVINE, California, January 14,
      1999 - Black Isle Studios(tm), the role-playing game division of Interplay Entertainment
      Corp. (NASDAQ: IPLY), announced today that Baldur's Gate(tm) has become the #1 selling
      title in early reports from many U.S. and Canadian retailers, #1 in the United Kingdom
      according to ChartTrack, #1 in the official GfK chart in France and is leading the Media
      Control chart in Germany. Retailers throughout the rest of Europe, Australia, Hong Kong
      and Singapore also announced incredible consumer anticipation in their markets, with
      record levels of pre-sale activity. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">To date, sell-through on Baldur's
      Gate is estimated at over 175,000 worldwide in the first two weeks that it has been
      available at retail. Developed by the Canada-based software company, BioWare Corp.(tm),
      Baldur's Gate began shipping to retailers on Wednesday, December 23, 1998, and has set new
      Interplay records previously held by Fallout 2(tm) and Descent(tm). </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">&quot;It is unusual to have a
      game work on a worldwide basis like this and it certainly is great news to have success
      with a product on such a scale,&quot; said Interplay Chairman &amp; CEO, Brian Fargo.
      &quot;We had to make a critical decision to spend the extra time to get the game right and
      delay the release, so it's especially satisfying to see it sell through to this level. The
      success of Baldur's Gate just adds to the positive momentum that we have enjoyed since the
      release of Fallout 2 in October.&quot; </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Baldur's Gate is an epic
      role-playing game set in the Forgotten Realms(r), TSR(r)'s most popular Advanced Dungeons
      &amp; Dragons(r) campaign setting, on five CDs featuring an enormous game world filled
      with nearly 10,000 unique scrolling game screens, heralding over 100 hours of gameplay.
      The gripping non-linear adventure spans seven chapters, with dozens of subplots that
      branch in and out of the main narrative, and the seamless adaptation of the AD&amp;D rule
      set allows the game to be played by anyone. </font></small></p>

      the stage for those players, it is Baldur's Gate that finally delivers what those
      disenchanted folks had been longing for. However, as we've said, it doesn't stop there.
      The game uses five CDs to deliver what ends up being a huge amount of gameplay, all in a
      beautiful world. Every map has pre-planned events; every area has quests, items, tricks,
      and traps. The game has been <em>designed</em> from head to toe. Stacked on top of that,
      though, is the ability to play the entire game with friends - an innovation that is
      entirely new for CRPGs. </font></small></p>
