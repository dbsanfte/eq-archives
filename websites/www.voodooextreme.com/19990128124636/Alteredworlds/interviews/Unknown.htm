    <small>By<a href="mailto:unitedrealms@cwix.com"> Madbard</a></small><br>
    <small>With: Kevin Ross</small></em></p>
    <p align="left"><small><em>Role Playing has become a buzzword in the Computer gaming arena
    lately and everyone seems to have titles in the pipe. Ross Systems is looking to add some
    of it's own Magic to the mix and possibly continue this trend. Our boy Madbard recently
    had a little discussion with Kevin Ross of Ross Systems and this is what came of the
    conversation. Step up to bat Unknown: Quest for the Golden Dragon.</em></small></p>
    <hr>
    <p><font color="#8080C0">MadBard: </font>First off could you tell us a little about Ross
    Systems and the team of people who are working with you on Unknown The Quest For The
    Golden Dragon?<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">KR:</font> Ross Systems is a small consulting firm in upstate New
    York. We specialize in network designs and custom programming. Our Team consists of a wide
    range of people ranging from programmers to artist. We have Kaid Software, which is
    working exclusively on the Unknown in producing<br>
    the models for the game. They have just come aboard in Late September.With both companies
    working on the Unknown we have 5 people working on it full time and 13 working on it in a
    part time bases.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">MadBard: </font>What is your background in CRPGs and RPGs in
    general?<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">KR: </font>Being a Role Player for over 10 years and a CRPG player
    for over 8 years I have a wide range and fascination on these type of games. From the
    early days of the Texas Instruments with Fairy Tale to the beginning of the Bard tales to
    Might and Magic I play them all. I am an avid D&amp;D and Warhammer player also. I enjoy
    the imagination required to build a world<br>
    for others to play. <br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">MadBard: </font>The first thing people will notice when the read
    about Unknown is the immense amount of detail that you are putting into the game. You
    easily win the Altered Worlds &quot;longest FAQ&quot; award. Details such as weather,
    appropriate clothing, party creation, swimming, eating, sleeping,<br>
    alignment, aging, player spell creation, banking, bank robbing, siege weapons and getting
    drunk are just a few of the things addressed in Unknown. Why did you decide to take on a
    project of such scope?<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">KR: </font>The reason I took on such a project was the
    disappointment of other RPG games. I want to be thrown into a world that I can interact
    with and have it interact with me. RPG games always seem, to fall short in one aspect or
    another. If the graphics are great the plot is weak. You would either get skills you never
    would use, or plots that meant really nothing in the game. We wanted to create a game also
    that we did not get<br>
    just our input but received ideas and views from others. We think this is one of our
    biggest advantages we listen to what other people have to say, we can not do this all by
    ourselves. We are not RPG gods, so it is nice to bounce ideas off other RPG players.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">MadBard:</font> Tell us a little about magic in the game. How does
    magic work in Unknown and what different types of magic are there?<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">KR: </font>Magic is done with Spell Points (Mana). Each of the
    casting classes, Mystic, Mage, Woodsman and Priest start off with x spell points in the
    beginning. Each spell they cast cost x of these points. For different type of magic is
    quite extensive. Besides breaking it up by class we have also broken it up by alignment.
    So evil Mages and Good mages might have a few of the same spells but they also have
    different ones. We also have advance classes that they can achieve that open up a whole
    new list of spells. We also have 20 unique Unknown spells in the game.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">MadBard: </font>Are you still planning to allow players to create
    their own spells?<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">KR:</font> Yes, this feature is written in but not fully tested.
    Combining spells together or talking to an NPC Sage who will create the spell for you will
    do it. <br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">MadBard:</font> Now Unknown will be both a single and multiplayer
    game. Is the multiplayer version going to be different then the single player version?<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">KR: </font>Yes the major difference between the multi-player and the
    single player is the multi-player is actually larger and has more plots. We also move the
    locations of all the dungeons and cities so someone who plays the single player can not
    enter the multi-player game and have an advantage.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">MadBard: </font>You also say that you plan on having a big game
    servers like battle-net. How much are you going to charge players for their use?<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">KR: </font>Right now we are trying to see if we can charge no
    monthly cost for the use of the game servers. We feel that charging a person to buy the
    game then play it is not fair. <br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">MadBard: </font>Can a player transfer a character from the single
    player game into the multiplayer version?<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">KR:</font> No, the single player characters are non-transferable.
    Since this would cause an imbalance in the game. Also some items in the single player are
    not in the multi-player. <br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">MadBard: </font>Will the online multiplayer game world change and
    grow?<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">KR:</font> For sure the Quest for the Golden Dragon is just the
    first chapter of a very large book. The world will expand with new lands, monsters, races
    and classes. <br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">MadBard:</font> How is communication handle in multiplayer? Can I
    talk to anyone anytime like in most large CRPGs?<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">KR:</font> Communication is handled as on screen commands only. You
    may talk, whisper and shout but it affects the characters only in the area that you are
    in. No mass communications exists at this time. Right now we are discussing on the message
    forums how we should handle this, by either displaying over a persons head or in message
    boxes. Since names are not<br>
    revealed in the game it adds a twist to already a complex task. Mass communication is not
    allowed because it is not RPG like. Being able to talk to a friend on the other-side of
    the world is not real. They did not have cell phones or telephones back then. You can hire
    a messenger to deliver a message to the person, which can be sometimes instant. <br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">MadBard:</font> Can people own buildings in Unknown?<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">KR:</font> Yes, you may own a house; guild and certain shops can be
    bought in the Unknown. <br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">MadBard: </font>Talk a little on player guilds in the multiplayer
    game.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">KR: </font>Player guilds are something we are working on with the
    guilds. We currently have given 15 guilds the ability to have us design a guild to his/her
    specifications. This means if they want a castle for a guild, or an underground cavern or
    even a house we gave them the choice. We aren taking these 15 guilds and the other 15 we
    designed and are making these the guildhalls for the game servers. Guildhalls can be
    bought, freed from evil if they occupied, or your daring taken over by attacking one<br>
    already occupied by players. The choice will be the players.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">MadBard: </font>How do you address player killing in the online
    version? And how does your jail system work?<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">KR: </font>Player killing is a fact of life so we had to approach it
    from a fair viewpoint. We have a level 3 system. Your level can not be any more then 3
    levels below the person you wish to kill. This includes parties also. An entire party's
    level can not be 3 levels below the person or persons you wish to kill. This rule is
    voided though if the person attacks you first. Our jail system works by actual putting a
    person in jail until his/ her time is up. They can be rescued if you have friends daring
    enough to try it. The times can range to a few minutes to a few days. This is real life,
    if you do the crime you will do the time. Since names, levels health points and spell
    points are not displayed when touching a person it will be harder for a pker to figure who
    he/she is attacking. Are the pkrs willing to swing at someone wearing no armor and is a
    25th level and they do not know it. We have over 15 rules in the game to combat it. We
    came up with a fair system that allows it but does place limits on it.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">MadBard: </font>What types of transportation will there be in
    Unknown?<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">KR: </font>Right now we have walking, running, riding a horse and
    soon flight. Ships are used for water travel. <br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">MadBard: </font>Just how big is the game world?<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">KR:</font> The world is hard to compare to games on the market. We
    currently feel we are about 25% smaller then UO world. We have 7 Major cities, 14 smaller
    villages over 50+ dungeons, caves, keeps, castles complex sewer systems to explore in the
    game. Not counting mountains, deserts and<br>
    forest to run around in.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">MadBard: </font>What perspective is Unknown played in?<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">KR:</font> The Unknown can be played in 1st or 3rd perspective. 3rd
    perspective can only be used outside open areas and right now it done from 6
    pre-determined views. We are working on a tracking camera that will allow the player to
    keep 3rd view on all the time. But will never reveal his/her back. None of us have eyes
    behind our heads.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">MadBard: </font>What engine are you using to make Unknown?<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">KR:</font> Due to NDA agreements we can not go into our engine. It
    is a joint adventure with another company.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">MadBard: </font>Are you planning on having 3Dfx support?<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">KR: </font>For sure, along with D3D support.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">MadBard: </font>Now a big part of any RPG is character creation. How
    is this handled in Unknown? And how many races and classes will you have?<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">KR: </font>Characters are created upon entering the game. You must
    sign up first with a name of the character and a password. This is not immediate the name
    of your character has to be approved by us and you are sent back a reply stating that name
    has been added. You then proceed to the character creation, you roll for basic attributes,
    and then you are asked what race you wish to be. We then allow you to pick your class
    based on the attributes you have. After this you are given your base skills, and are
    allowed to pick 2 additional skills. Then we give you<br>
    skill points that can be used to adjust your character as you see fit. By increasing or
    decreasing skills or attributes or spell points. We currently have 14 races listed with 2
    still not revealed we have 15 classes I with 3 of them still not revealed.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">MadBard: </font>About how many different skills will be available to
    learn in the game?<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">KR: </font>Currently 54 skills exist in the game.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">MadBard: </font>And lastly about how much of Unknown is complete
    right now?<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">KR: </font>Currently the game is over the 50% mark. We would be
    closer tocompletion but has you might already know we are converting the entiregame to
    16bit. This is taken time and some re-coding. Along with addingcolored lighting, smoke
    affects, glow and other visual affects to thegame. </p>
