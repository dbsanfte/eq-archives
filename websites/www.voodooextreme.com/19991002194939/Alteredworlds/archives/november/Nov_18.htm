    <small>Another <a href="http://pc.ign.com/previews/2252.html">update </a>coming from the
    guys over at IGN.PC, this time on travelling in parties. These guys must have really<font color="#FFFFFF"><strong> dished out some major Twinkies </strong></font>to get on the
    Beta! Also, a quick reminder to you wacky bastards who haven't signed up for the Beta, the
    Apps should be reposted for 24 hours starting tomorrow until the 20th. Anyway, here's a
    blurb to wet your appetite.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Okay, after a week
      of promises, we can finally give you decent details on what it's like to travel in a
      party. We started out yesterday evening with my Dwarf fighter in Kaladim, the city of the
      Dwarves, and Tal's Human monk in Qeynos, a Western Human town. These two population
      centers were not only separated from each other by vast distances, but by a really large
      body of water as well. Even so, as a fourth level fighter, I felt like I had enough
      experience under my belt to get out of any sort of danger that presented itself, so I set
      out to join up with my Human buddy so many miles away. </font></small></p>

    <small>Slap me on the ass and <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>call me Bob the one legged
    Halfling</strong></font>. Brad has been hitting the Crack Pipe pretty hard lately and was
    on the boards spewing more EQ goodness to all the girls and boys. He's really got it in
    for us now, I think he wants to see our dead rotting corpses before he throws screenshots
    our way. Here's the goods. This first one is on the controversial subject of Gate and
    Teleportation spells.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">There is no gate
      spell to get anyone anywhere. There are, as I've always said, teleport spells that are
      very limited, the more powerful of which are only available to higher level wizards and
      druids. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The spell 'gate' is given to most
      mages at lvl 10, and allows them (and only them) to return to their home point, which is
      very restricted as to where it can be.-Brad</font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>Next we have him touching on the Beta choices when picking Beta 3 etc. Hell, I
    always thought you had to bribe them with<font color="#FFFFFF"><strong> Hostess Cream Pies

    send me any pics!</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">There were definite critera used
      when selecting phase 3 testers, however they were different than those used for previous
      phases. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Are we becoming less picky as
      time goes on? Yes and no. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">A lot (but not all) of phase 3 is
      about stress testing our beta server, about filling it up, optimizing, debugging, etc. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">We've been tuning the gameplay
      and balancing since phase .5, and we continue to do so (everyone in the previous phases is
      still in phase 3). </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Also, keep in mind that at this
      point we need people with different backgrounds, some more technical than others, some
      more experienced than others, to test the game. An example: is the interface intuitive for
      a non-hard core RPG player? How does the game play on lower end machines? etc. etc. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">We have a lot to learn from beta,
      which is why we're doing beta tests. And each phase has its purposes, and so far so good
      :) Phase .5, 1, and 2 were a great success.-</font></small></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Though Delphine has
      been relatively quiet in recent years, it appears to have a real winner on its hands in
      Darkstone. You're not far off if you think of the concept as Diablo in 3D. Although it
      can't touch Blizzard North's Diablo II in the character-customization department,
      Darkstone leapfrogs that title in regard to graphics. Expect eight polygonal player
      characters; more than 80 monsters; dozens of spells and weapons; real-time camera
      manipulation and zooming; excellent lighting and spell particle effects; and all sorts of
      ambient details, including plowing villagers, roaming chickens, and lively town centers,
      complete with character interaction. The game's elegant color palette is also perfect for
      its fantasy setting. </font></small></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"><small>We aren't absolutely

      We are going to try our best, though, and we will have plenty of time to play around and
      tweak the system to make things stable, fair, and fun. If we find that permanent death is
      inalienably a detriment to gameplay, we'll probably go back to the old PvP switch idea. I
      doubt very seriously that this will happen since we have amassed quite a few ideas for
      systems that we will use to control PvP and Permanent death frequency. Have faith, and

    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Actually, I've said all along
      that we will try to get d3d support in for resolutions higher than 640x480. It's just not
      in yet, and I'm not going to say it's there yet if it's not. It has always been my policy
      to not exagerate and to be honest with the public. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">At this point, it looks likely

    <small>The guys over at VN had a little <a href="http://www.vaultnetwork.com/features/interviews/destiny.shtml">chat with Terence Tan</a>
    who is the lead developer behind Destiny an upcoming RPG that<font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>
    looks tasty.</strong></font> Here's a blurb to tide you over.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"><b>Arreouw: Your website
      indicates that Destiny was designed as a multi-player game - will it be for unlimited
      players, or for a fixed number playing quests together as a party? Will there be one or
      more servers to handle the players? Will there be continuity among the servers, or will
      they be separated, as are the shards in Ultima Online? How do you plan to handle lag?</b> </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"><b>Terence Tan:</b> Destiny was
      orginally designed as an online-ONLY multi-player game. We spent about 6 months developing
      a prototype of this system, basing on developing a 'story driven' multi-player game
      system. I felt that what Ultima left out was the fact that people who play wanted to be
      heroes, and live stories. The system had Windows NT has the server, and used DCOM/COM to
      do our fault-tolerant and distribution. The client ran on Windows 95. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">We finished our prototype, and
      were planning on building the 'real' version of the game but unfortunately as fate would
      have it, the Asian economic crisis struck. Beggars can't be choosers, so I talked to our
      investors into converting much of our researched technology into a product that we could
      sell off-the-shelf. So it will also have a single-player mode.</font></small></p>

    patches before it hits stores...:). Here's some thoughts on BG multiplayer from Ray...</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Let me ask you this:<br>
      <br>
      Would you play pen and paper AD&amp;D with someone who told you that she or he had all
      18's as their rolls? &quot;Just got lucky,&quot; or some such excuse. And a pet
      pseudodragon to boot. Yeah, right.<br>
      <br>
      The same applies to multiplayer sessions. Play with people you know, and if you don't know
      them, run your own server and control what they are allowed to import. If you think
      they're cheating and don't like it, boot them out. <br>
      <br>
      We realized early on that only a human DM could provide the control that was required to
      prevent pkilling and cheaters from proliferating. They'll still be out there - and that's
      ok, because they'll be in uncontrolled games where everyone knows that the sky's the limit
      and you can do whatever you wish. If you don't want this, we provide an alternative - play
      with people you know or run your own server.<br>

      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Wow, haven't been
      here for a while, and look what I wandered into...maybe I should have pretended I didn't
      see this and just go back to playing BG some more (finding bugs is FUN :)<br>
      <br>
      But for your first question: I haven't yet played Fallout2, nor has anyone else here at
      BioWare - so I can't comment on the quality level - I haven't seen the game yet. I WILL be
      playing it as the #1 pick on my &quot;games to play&quot; list soon as we ship BG, and
      I'll let you know what I think once I have played it, all the way through.<br>
      <br>
      I am playing BG for the second time through right now. I'll be either the first or second
      person in the BW office to finish it twice, and this time I'm doing EVERYTHING. I'm
      devoting every waking hour to playing the game and finding bugs - 14-16 hours a day, seven
      days a week (for nearly two months now. Ugh. I've played chapters 1-3 about 50 times
      now...) So far, I've spent about 120 hours in this particular full-game (all chapters, all
      subplots) session, and I estimate that I have another 40 hours or more left still before I
      have done everything. I've talked to every single person I saw, entered every single
      house, walked over every inch of terrain I could walk to, and tried to finish every single
      subplot that I know about. I've reported over a thousand bugs personally on the project so
      far, and I can honestly say that this pass, all of the ones I found last time are fixed. I
      and others here and Interplay's QA department are still entering more, but they are
      increasingly of the type that only people &quot;in the know&quot; - i.e. who know the
      interface and story intimately - can really call bugs. We still want the game to be
      perfect, the kind of game that we'd buy ourselves, so that's why we're still fixing these
      bugs. I know that the people (Chris Parker, Greg P and others) who are working on BG at
      Black Isle feel the same way that the folks at BioWare do - we've been working together a
      LONG time.<br>
      <br>
      Trust me, we've invested over one tenth of our lives on this project (I'm 30, and most of
      the other team members are 25-30), so we don't want to let it go until we think it's
      ready. The game is HUGE, so there are certainly bugs that will be missed, but we want to
      keep these to minimum - everyone's doing their very best, really.<br>
      <br>
      Now back to finding bugs...fun, fun!<br>
      <br>

    <small>Yeah, Billy was right, this is the day Momma Sacrates popped me out of the Love
    pipe and I have been breast feeding ever since! Anyway, updates may be a bit sporadic
    today for obvious reasons but we'll keep the flow coming your way. Now if only Half Life
    would hit the stores today <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>all would be right and good with
    the world</strong></font>. Oh well, at least tomorrow or Friday is fine. As for my age,
    yup i'm older than the Pyramids, ok not that old. Basically old enough to remember who HR
    Puffinstuff was. (27) Gotta go find some breasts to feed on right now, be back later.</small></td>
