    <small>My senses are completely shot at the moment. US totally bitch slapped Iraq tonight,
    our President is this..........close to getting impeached and I have a ton of games I need

    Friday night. Also of note is that Gameceneter just slapped up the first big<a href="http://www.gamecenter.com/Peeks/Teamfort/?st.gc.fd.gcb"> Preview of Team Fortress 2</a>
    for Half Life. Someone needs to tell Sierra about the load times for KQ though! That is

      Mask Of Eternity is a King's Quest product in name only. There is only a tenuous
      connection to the heraldry and chivalry of its predecessors, the story line is thinner,
      the settings are a far cry from previous pastoral scenes, they've added combat, and the
      3-D game environment is completely new. On the other hand, Mask once again follows Sierra
      co-founder Roberta Williams' timeworn, now de rigueur adventuring formula. </font></small></p>

      EAX (SBLive!) support added. <br>

      Problem with choppyness related at AI addressed. <br>
      Full Joystick (and gamepad?) support. <br>
      Other minor internal bugs fixed <br>
      Level skip cheat added (you see, LGS listens!) <br>
      Also note that no modifications to the AI are planned in this patch. All of this info is

      server are growing more and more stable, and we're rapidly tuning and balancing the

      the proud publisher of two of the titles orphaned by the demise of Virgin Interactive
      Entertainment. In August, 1998, Electronic Arts purchased Virgin from Spelling
      Entertainment for $122.5 million in cash. While Westwood (a wholly-owned subsidiary of
      Virgin) still survives the deal, Virgin Interactive was dissolved and its products set
      afloat. Two of them were ultimately picked up by Westwood. Swords and Sorcery, by
      developers John Hight and D.W. Bradley (creator of Wizardry), and Nox, another
      role-playing game that has gained the moniker &quot;a thinking man's Diablo,&quot; will

      Westwood already has an upcoming RPG, Lands of Lore III, Cohen is confident that these
      fledgling RPGs will be excellent companions and worthy of the Westwood name. Look for

      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Over the years, loyal gamers have
      traveled throughout the mythical kingdom of Daventry and often into realms beyond, playing
      a wide variety of characters, both male and female, as they pursued those kingly quests.
      The series has always stretched to accommodate new innovations in PC technology, including
      the first sound cards, the first CD-ROMs, and even VGA color--so given the game's history,
      and the wide availability of 3D cards in today's home computers, it was inevitable that
      Daventry would go 3D. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Mask of Eternity, the latest
      installment of the King's Quest series, is the face of tomorrow. It offers a new look for
      a classic name in computer gaming. Fortunately, in addition to the improved graphics, the
      folks at Sierra Studios added a new dimension to the classic series; they've enriched the
      story with deeper meaning as well. </font></small></p>

    <p><small>On whether or not any bugs were found that may delay the release.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">We haven't. The actual
      announcement of when the game will come out will be coming from our publisher, Black

    <small>I'm starting to like Ryan Palacio This guy is really<font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>
    pimping out the messages</strong></font> on the Boards lately. Now let's see if he can
    keep up with the BG boys. Here is a rather large biscuit in response to an Economy
    question.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"><small>The concepts and measures that
      have been implemented to cope with the situations that arise<br>
      from players bequeathing items to lower level players does _NOT_ affect the player who <br>
      plays without outside help. The system is in fact designed to discourage bequeathal yet<br>
      acknowledging the fact that it will happen. Many phase 3 testers were not granted anything
      by<br>
      others and yet have accelerated FASTER than phase 2 and phase 1 testers. Why? Because<br>
      the economy is based around the concept that items will find their way to lower level
      players<br>
      eventually. It may not be &quot;given&quot;, but rather sold/traded/auctioned/bartered
      etc... So in essence,<br>
      you are indeed reaping the rewards of those before you, just at a cost to yourself instead
      of free </small></font></p>
      <p><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"><small>Let me give an example: </small></font></p>
      <p><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"><small>Everyone is even level -
      therefore everyone is competing for the same items and NPCs. Rare<br>
      items hold an extremely high value due to high demand and low supply. There is a
      stagnation<br>
      in the economy due to lack of player-to-player trading and lack of desire to do so. </small></font></p>
      <p><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"><small>Levels are homogenously
      distributed over a range of 30 levels or so... Level 30 PCs require a<br>
      larger sum of capital to improve their equipment due to rarity, difficulty of acquisition,
      and/or<br>
      cost. Therefore it is feasible for the level 30 to collect items which he/she does not
      need for <br>
      personal use (said PC may find a weapon that is not as good as his/her current weapon) and<br>
      therefore see a means of generating cash. The merchants are very cut-throatish and tend to
      <br>
      drive a hard bargain - therefore it is in this players interest to find a lower level PC
      who would<br>
      desire said item and pay well for it (read &quot;better than merchant price&quot;). This
      generates cash for<br>
      the upper level player while also placing the items into the hands of the lower level
      player. </small></font></p>
      <p><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"><small>Scenarios such as the above are
      and will be common for the 20-30 player saving up for plate<br>
      armor (remember the quote about platemail and leer jets?) and therefore affect the lower
      level<br>
      community. This is by no means a bad thing as it saves the lower level player time and
      cash.<br>
      A semi-symbiotic relation begins to form. The lower levels provide the higher ups with
      cash, <br>
      and in exchange, the higher ups provide improved weaponry at discount prices. </small></font></p>
      <p><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"><small>Should you wish to play solo and
      be relatively anti-social and refuse interaction with others all<br>
      together (not suggesting that you are, just making a point about extremes), shops will
      provide<br>
      you with equivalents for most items at significantly higher-than-street-price cost. </small></font></p>
      <p><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"><small>The system by no means handicaps
      the &quot;pure&quot; player (as you put it). </small></font></p>
      <p><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"><small>If you group with others, explore
      the world, interact with the environment, complete quests and <br>
      slay foul beasts, you will be more than self sufficient and quickly find yourself in the
      position of the higher ups - looking to generate cash while keeping your eye on whatever
      golden ring you <br>
      have set for yourself - as a paladin, most likely plate and a very big sword =)</small></font></p>
