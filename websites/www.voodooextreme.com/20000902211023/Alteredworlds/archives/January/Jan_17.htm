    <small>Stephen Nichols had a little time in between working on Middle Earth and visiting<a href="http://www.realhamster.com/"> RealHampster.com</a>. He has a bit to say on all
    subjects in the game. No, <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>not his personal favorite Hampster
    model either</strong></font>. Not that he owns one of course. </small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">I'm happy to respond to the
      issues that you have raised: </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">1) Unrealistic Permanent Death:
      While you are absolutely correct that players will adapt to just about any game system,
      there is a breaking point for most people. To model combat to the same level as the
      reality of Middle-earth would make the game very difficult -- more difficult than any
      other computer game around. Of course, playing styles will adapt to fit the rules so long
      as the game is enjoyable. There is a reason why most people in Middle-earth did not
      adventure... it's both because they have real lives to worry about and they are afraid of
      the possibility of death. The role of a computer game is to entertain, not hamper the fun
      of players with ultra-realistic rules. If permanent death is too easy to fall prey to, it
      will ruin the game for the majority of players. Certainly, I see the merits of such a
      system and find it to be very attractive to the hard-core roleplayers, but to be
      successful we must set our sights on more than the hard-core players. The purpose of our
      permanent death system is to provide both an avenue of player-driven justice and to give
      risk to any unknown situation, not to encourage players to stay at home. My goal is to
      make sure that you can protect yourself from permanent death if your spend enough time to
      prepare. To implement a more susceptible form of death would translate into severe
      frustration for the average player. The risk of our permanent death system still exists,
      not to the extreme degree of reality, but it still exists. If you venture into
      monster-infested areas unprepared, you do risk permanent death. What does it matter if the
      game must expend your health points to knock you unconscious first? Does that really
      eliminate the risk? No. It makes permanent death a manageable risk. Certainly, between
      players, permanent death must be a premeditated act that is purposefully carried out. Is
      that such a bad thing? Some would argue that it skews the feeling of the permanent death
      system, making it a tool of the powerful. Is that any different from a more realistic
      system? I would argue that a more lenient system of permanent death would encourage more
      abuse. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">2) Character Persistence: Simply
      starting with a fixed number of characters per server is not a valid solution to the
      problem. Say we sell 50,000 copies in the first six months of the game? A fixed number of
      NPCs may work in that scenario... until we sold another 100,000 copies. Also, having PCs
      replace NPCs limits the possibility of us creating persistent NPCs that grow with the
      game. What do we do, remove the local shopkeeper and put a player in his place? What if
      that player want's nothing to do with a shop and wants to adventure? This is where this
      idea breaks down. Not only that, but we can not provide an AI system sophisticated enough
      to accomodate every players play style. I guarantee that most of the players in the game
      will be nomadic and will travel all over the map in search of activities. If that is the
      case, what would a persistent character system do when you logged out in the depths of
      Moria? Should it walk home to handle your daily work? I think not. Such a system would
      remove the control of your character from you. You really would have no idea what your
      character had done since you logged off last. Not to mention that with such a system,
      permanent death would be even more rampant. These persistent characters would become a
      favorite target of player-killers simply beacuse the AI will not be as good as the player
      (making them an easy target). Ultimately it comes down to the issue of scalability. We can
      not afford to put up 20 servers just because each server is bogged down processing the AI
      for players that are not playing. That is not a financially viable option. We calculate
      our server expense by estimating how many players we will have at peak times. Of course,
      under this system, the peak times would not exist. Every minute of every day would be a
      peak time... and the peak would keep on growing with the number of copies sold. Now,
      here's where persistence is allowed. If your character is subdued and bound by either a
      monster or player, your character continues to be active after you log out. This lets the
      giant spiders bind you in threads and hang you for later consumption. If you log out, your
      character does not. Your character will stay logged in so long as you are captive... once
      freed and moved to safety, the standard 5 minute waiting period takes precedence before
      you finally disconnect. As for there being less need for NPCs as the PC population grows,
      all I can say is that you are very optomistic. Most players will not want to do the
      &quot;boring&quot; jobs that the NPCs do (especially if their job is chosen for them due
      to NPC replacement). Being forced to do menial work is not fun, and a game should be fun.
      Also, while computer technology is constantly evolving, we have to settle on a server
      platform early on in the development cycle. We simply can't develop features that may be
      supportable some time in the future, that's not a good way to do business. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">3) Reputation: Our reputation
      system is based on location. If you murder a shopkeeper in the Shire, you are a murderer.
      Kill an Orc, and you may get a medal! NPCs most certainly will defend themselves properly,
      dishing out permanent death to those who are deserving. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">4) Global Chat: I'm really not
      interested in what might have happened in the books if a concept of global chat existed.
      That has very little impact on the playability of the game. Having a simple method of
      communication is necessary in this kind of game. This is true simply because of the
      nomadic nature of the player. Players will not sit at home all day tending their shop,
      they will travel the map searching for adventure. This constant travel syndrome makes it
      impossible to stay in touch with your friends in-game without some form of direct
      communication. What we have here is an approximation of the Tolkien universe where people
      from all over the world play at varying times of the day. This is undeniable. For players
      to keep in contact with each other through their varying play times, a form of direct
      communication is necessary. Certainly, if players were in the game 24/7, global chat would
      be less important because people's behavior would be more predictable. Again, if
      ultimately an issue of ease of use, not role-playing. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">5) Multiple Characters: While you
      may not be able to play with family members at the same time, that does not mean that they
      can not help one another in the game. It is a simple idea to grasp that family members may
      share goods to further their in-game standings. But that is not even the most important
      reason. If we only provide one character slot per server, it would be most difficult for
      players to experience different facets of gameplay without erasing other players on their
      account. We will not be shipping with 10 servers in place, more probably we will ship with
      just two at first. This means that you can only play have two different characters at any
      one time. Part of the fun of this kind of game is the ability to play it from different
      points of view. It would be impossible for you to create a new character on a server where
      you are already well known and work that character up in a familiar setting (unless you
      erase your famous character which has lived for a long time). Without the ability to
      create multiple characters, you will find people growing tired of the game in time. Many
      players do not want to erase their favorite character so that they can make a new one, and
      to force them to do so would be quite illogical in my opinion. Again, this comes down to
      replayability and flexibility. Letting people sample the game in all of its forms is not a
      bad thing... it can only be a good thing. The exploitation can be combatted with other
      approaches that do not remove the flexibility of the game. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">6) Why call it a roleplaying
      game? Because it is. Nothing stops you from playing a role in this game. Nothing at all.
      We are giving each of you the flexibility to tailor the game to your particular tastes.
      Some will role-play (hopefully many), and some will not. That's out of my control... I can
      not force people to role-play, but I can encourage it. To enforce role-playing is too
      limiting in my opinion and would turn away the casual player which is so vital to our
      financial success. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">7) Why are you putting the name
      &quot;Middle-earth&quot; on the label? Because the game is based on the Middle-earth
      universe. Certainly, it is not a simulation of the world, but an interpretation to a
      medium that it was not meant for at conception. That's not to say that the translation
      will lessen the work, but certain concessions for the gameplay must be made for it to be a
      viable product. That is my ultimate goal, to make a viable product that offsets the
      millions of dollars put into it. To be viable, we must make the game playable by the
      average person, not just the hard-core roleplayer. Unless, of course, we had enough
      hard-core roleplayers willing to pay $100 a month for the privelege to play. But for some
      reason, I feel that resource would be in short supply. </font></small></p>

      <strong><p><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Shaun Leach</strong> -- For the
      most part, we have tried very hard to limit the AI's access to internal information that
      is not available to the player. This means that the AI actually has to use sight, sound
      and touch to move around and interact in their enviroment. So unlike some games where the
      moment the player presses the fire button the AI reacts, our AI doesn't know anything is
      going on until they actually see that something very bad is coming at them. The other
      benefit is that the AI actually has to see or hear the player before they'll do anything.
      This is unlike most games where the player crossing some invisible marker causes them to
      start doing something. I think that this alone gives our AI a more &quot;natural&quot;
      feel instead of a bot feel and gives us a lot more game play possibilities. </font></font></p>

      <p><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"><small>Dear Phase 4 Beta Applicant: </small><br>
      <small><br>
      Several questions have been brought to our attention following yesterday's email. We felt
      it important to address these issues and to keep our future testers informed. </small><br>
      <small><br>
      1. International Customers - We value all of our customers, regardless of their location.
      We realize that by restricting Phase 4 of the EverQuest Beta test to US and Canadian
      residents, people outside this region are frustrated. Unfortunately, due to timing and
      cost limitations we simply were unable to accommodate you. We do apologize for this, and
      wanted to assure everyone that EverQuest WILL indeed be available internationally. </small><br>
      <small><br>
      2. Timing Issues - In order to ensure that all Phase 4 CDs are sent out in sufficient
      time, it is necessary that you sign up by January 22nd. After that date, we will no longer
      be able to accept orders for the Phase 4 CD and the page will be removed. We will begin to
      process orders immediately and shipping of CDs should commence on January 27th. The test
      itself will begin February 10th and will continue until shortly before commercial release
      of the game on March 16th. </small></font></p>
      <p><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"><small>As always, we appreciate your
      willingness to help test EverQuest and to make it a revolutionary success. You have our
      commitment to keep you informed as we come closer to both Phase 4 and release. </small><br>
      <small><br>
      The EverQuest Team </small></font></p>

    <small>Just noticed over at VN this little<a href="http://members.xoom.com/Hijakkk/exclusiveinterview.htm"> Interview with John Cutter </a>that's
    up over at the Elysium Livewire. Stop by and read up on it. This game looks tasty.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p></i><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">There is &quot;magic&quot;
      in Elysium, but the natives don't call it that. We've come up with a really innovative
      magic system for the game, but I can't go into details about it. This system will allow us
      to have a very large number of effects that are easily accessible to the player. There are
      no scrolls, books, or spells in Elysium, the magic is more natural. We've tried to
      simulate &quot;wishcraft&quot;, so players will be able to think, &quot;Gee, I wish I
      could <blank>&quot; and there will actually be a way for them to do that. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">We wanted to keep the excitement
      of real time combats, but the player does have the option to slow down or stop the action
      while he or she is using the game interface. I don't like games that force you to fight
      the interface instead of the creature(s) on the screen. If I'm being attacked while I'm
      messing around in my inventory looking for a healing potion, I get really angry and
      frustrated. We're going out of our way to avoid these and other frustrations in Elysium. </font></small></p>
