    <small>Looks like Richard &quot;Lord British&quot; Garriot got kind of wacky and wrote a
    big ass discussion on Symbols and other juicy things. This is<a href="http://www.ultima-ascension.com/info/words.html"> very good reading</a> by one of
    the masters of our Industry. <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Maybe he should collaborate
    with John Romero and Sid Meir sometime</strong></font>? Hehe, I could only imagine the
    ego's out of that. Sid would be screaming &quot;let's have turn based combat with resource
    management&quot;, John Romero would be there screaming &quot;Kill, die, kill die&quot;
    &nbsp; and Lord British would be there &quot;Let us have a virtuous character to begin
    with and everything will be all good and right in the world&quot;. <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Then
    of course the bitch slapping begins</strong></font>. Could only imagine what game would
    come out of that? Civ-Ulti-Quake or something. Anyway go read this little piece if you
    thought Warren Spector's was any good yesterday, this one is great. Here's a sneak peak.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The plot lines in
      most RPG&#146;s are basically the same old drivel, over and over again. I call it the
      standard RPG plot. I think you will find it familiar: You start the game as the great
      hero. (You know this because you are told so in the instructions.) You job is to kill the
      big evil guy. (Also, from the instructions.) You pillage and plunder everyone and
      everything to become strong for your final battle. (Of course the supposed bad guy is
      doing no evil right now, but you sure are.) When ready at last, you kill the &#147;bad
      guy&#148; who has been sitting there peacefully waiting. <br>
      <br>
      Well, after 3 games of my own that retold this story, combined with all that
      introspection, I was ready for something more. I felt that role-playing would be even
      stronger in a more realistic setting. I felt that people are basically good, not merely
      for fear of some divine being, but because it was logical. Thus was born the modern Ultima
      design. I was really worried before we released Ultima IV: Quest of the Avatar, that
      people might think I&#146;d gone off the philosophical deep end, but instead, it was my
      first best selling game. <br>
      <br>
      Ultimas since then have had a deep sense of ethics, which I carefully separate from
      morals. By my definition, Ethics are logically based, while Morals are religion based.
      Thus, if you object to pre-marital sex because it is against God&#146;s laws, that&#146;s
      Morality; if you oppose it because of the risk of unwanted pregnancies, that&#146;s an
      Ethic. I do not subscribe to any Morals, yet believe I am a very Ethical person. </font></small></p>

      two different types of Drakan Multi-player in the box: Deathmatch and something
      tentatively called &quot;Queen of the Dragon&quot;. Deathmatch play actually has two
      variations: Ground combat only (i.e. no dragon) with sword-to-sword combat only, and
      aerial combat which includes ground combat, but truthfully we don't expect anyone to hop
      off their dragon for sword-to-sword play when there are other dragons flapping around! The
      second mode, &quot;Queen of the Dragon&quot; will have up to 8 people on the ground and
      only one dragon.&nbsp; Everyone will be fighting sword-to-sword, while trying to find the
      Dragon's soul crystal.&nbsp; Whoever finds the soul crystal can then approach the dragon
      without getting instantly toasted, mount the dragon, and rain fire down on all of the

      our geeky roots in paper gaming (a<br>
      medium with only a dangerous, super-ficial relation to electronic gaming). Role-playing
      isn&#146;t about statistics or exploring randomly generated worlds of crate-filled
      buildings. It isn&#146;t about ran-dom<br>
      quests and combat encounters<br>
      every sixteen steps. It isn&#146;t even about +37 Swords of Instant Critical Hits that do
      Double Damage From Behind! Role-playing is about giving players the free-dom to act as
      they see fit, within the framework of a story we provide. Role-playing is about characters<br>
      developing in unique and meaningful ways as a result of player choices. It&#146;s about
      trying new behaviors in a safe set-ting before we try them in the real<br>
      world. In the space I have here, I can&#146;t tell you how we make a game that allows us
      to do all that. But let&#146;s start by identifying problems, and by looking at character,
      setting, and story, and how we usually approach them.</font></p>

    <small>Just over at VN who noticed that the boys at <a href="http://www.diabloii.net/">The

    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Hi Elly and others, </font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <i><blockquote>
      </i><p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Well, this issue sure has
      stirred up a lot of controversy! I'd like to defuse that a bit if I can. As the game is
      not complete and we haven't made final decisions about a lot of things, there is a
      considerable amount of info that I'm not at liberty to give at this time. However, I can
      tell you the following: </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">* There will be cheat-free,
      B.net-only characters. You will not be able to level up offline as we must control all of
      the character information internally. The cheating is by far our biggest complaint from
      our customers, and we'd like to accomodate them with this arrangement. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">* THERE WILL BE OTHER MULTIPLAYER
      OPTIONS!!! We understand the situation our customers overseas face. It is not practical to
      log onto the internet every time you play, due to the costs, etc. So, we will include
      provisions for you to play multiplayer without the characters stored on our side, and
      without necessarily logging onto B.net. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">However, these characters and the
      above B.net-only characters will be incompatible, and cannot play in the same game, as
      this would introduce possible hacks into the cheat-free world. So, in effect, there will
      be multiplayer much like it exists now (with many extra options as well) AND a pristine,
      cheat-free B.net environment for those who are able and eager to do so. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">I hope this clears it up a
      little; we are concerned and sensitive to the differing needs of our customers. Diablo II
      will hopefully be an improvement in EVERY way to the original. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Additionally, the fear of
      &quot;losing&quot; your character due to a disconnect are unfounded. Your character data
      will be frequently updated and backed up on our server network. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Thanks for your continued
      enthusiasm! </font></small></p>

    BG Boards to back up on.<font color="#FFFFFF"> <strong>These guys post like the Skipper
    and an all you can eat buffet</strong>.</font> Anyway here is Luke talking about Drizzt in
    the game.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Drizzt is also
      practically a legend, and known to be good (as well as exceptionally deadly). Your party
      members will only attack him if you tell them too.<br>
      <br>
      &gt;Also, Elminster is good. Will he react(talk to,<br>
      etc.) with an evil party, if it is what I want my alignment to be? The Elminster and
      Drizzt in the novels would attack evil aligned characters. I think I've read too much. <br>
      <br>
      Elminster may be good, but he is also a watcher, and does not directly intervene. Indeed,
      if he were to take an interest in killing you, there is nowhere you would be able to hide
      (and you WOULD die). Besides, it wouldn't be the first time Elminster has had to deal with
      undesirables. Your &quot;evil&quot; would have to be truly epic for him to confront you
      directly.<br>
      <br>
      As for Drizzt, I think he would wait for you to prove your evil nature (by attacking him
      perhaps). If anyone in the Realms should give someone the benefit of the doubt and not
      judge by appearances, it should be him.</font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left"><small>More Luke on Experience etc.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">When you dual class
      it freezes your first class at the minimum experience for it's current level.<br>
      So, if you play a fighter to 89000(level 7) and you dual class, you get set to the minimum
      for level 7 (64000). That means you could go and gain 25000 XP all over again, reaching
      level five as a mage in your second class. <br>
      Your first class would be forever out of your reach though, as you need to get one level
      higher in your new class for the old one to reactivate, and the total XP cap would not
      allow that(you would need 90000XP to reach level 8 as a mage. this would be 154000 total
      between the two classes).</font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left"><small>Jim Bishop from Wizards of the Coast was also in the backroom
    talking about Dragonlance etc.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">I think you're
      absolutely right:the challenge is to steer the game between the two extremes of Epic
      Storytelling and pipsqueak no-impact gaming.<br>
      <br>
      It's a narrow path, and I'm not sure where the &quot;best route&quot; lies, but after
      reading a lot of DL, and playing a lot of the old modules, I'm sure there's room for
      innovation in that world. Think about how the Star Wars franchise has done it with their
      very successful novels and games, and you begin to imagine great possibilities for gaming
      in Krynn that are just to the left or right of center stage, without being all the way off
      stage.</font></small></p>

    brilliant over at E3 when they were on display. Had a very cinematic style yet very

      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">SD: &quot;We're making new waves
      in current technology. Our animation system produces more lifelike characters and
      animations than gamers are probably used to. The seamless, single- skinned skeletal system
      allows us to blend different animations in the same character and manipulate any part of a
      character's body in AI. This means new gameplay is created where the player is no longer
      confined to interact with the environment in pre-set ways. Rynn can grab nearby objects
      from any orientation. Enemies actually bend over to swing swords at you and look you in
      the eye when you strafe around them. It creates a very dynamic combat system. Oh, and did
      I mention we can also chop off limbs, and still keep the characters as one seamless
      skin?&quot;</font></small></p>

    in the coming. Origin's development team for Ultima Online has posted the first public
    draft of the proposed changes in the upcoming housing patch. From the looks of it, it's a

      <p align="left"><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"><small>That brings us to
      vendors. We'd like to foster the use of shops, rather than roadside vendors. Shops are a
      more social experience, can provide more fictional atmosphere, and can be coupled with the
      lockdown feature to allow larger inventories for merchants. So we propose to not permit
      vendors outside of buildings anymore. Instead, the capability to have more than one vendor
      per building would be added. We would also add the ability for the owner of the building
      to allow vendors placed by others as well, so that players can create mini-malls or
      marketplaces which house multiple businesses. However, in order to ensure that vendors are
      used as shops, and not as banks, we will remove the ability to lock the front door of
      shops. </small><br>
      <br>
      <small>In other words, the building will be designated as &quot;public.&quot; This will
      allow those merchants who value the location of their current vendors to replace their
      tent with a building in the same location, and create a nice shop. Additional features,
      such as adding the ability to customize the shop sign to use the graphic for whatever shop
      type the owner designates, and for automatic advertising on bulletin boards, allows the
      shop to function better.</small></font></p>

    with Richard Garriott. Part seven is dealing with the controversial decision to nix the

      Why did you decide to get rid of the party of companions in Ultima: Ascension? I think
      people were disappointed with the prospect that the 3D technology may have made it
      necessary to get rid of the party of companions.</em></p>
      <p><strong>Richard Garriott:</strong> People aren't in here playing the game every day,
      and I'm telling you, the reason why we decided upon a single character is that once you
      build a world that's this immersive, the companions became baggage, more than they became
      an aspect that made the experience fun. But you still meet your own companions, they still
      do things with you, they occasionally actually travel with you for short stints, but
      fundamentally you're on your own.</small></font></p>
