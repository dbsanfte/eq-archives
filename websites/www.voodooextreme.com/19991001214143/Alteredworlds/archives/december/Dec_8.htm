    <small>Good God, I don't believe Billy out-scooped me on this one. Either way it's the

    mention a good nudie seen, but I didn't say that did I?) Anyway, News is slow and i'm <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>starting to scratch my ass</strong></font> waiting for
    Bowmeister's Review of RTK Love to come up any second now. We've got some good stuff in
    the pipe right now. I mean really good, as soon as I get the Screenshots for this bad ass

    <a href="mailto:sacrates@voodooextreme.com"><small>- Sacrates</small></a><br>
    <small>Here is an interesting bit I picked off of UO Vault. Looks like people with
    specific Role Playing skills are being chosen as seers in the game. I think this is <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>a wonderfull idea on OSI's part.</strong></font> This could be
    something interesting that we may see in EQ also? Anyway here is a tidbit, for the rest
    head on over to<a href="http://www.uovault.com/"> UO Vault</a>.</small><font color="#C1C1FF" face="Arial"><strong> </strong></font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"><u><b>How do I become a Seer?</b></u><br>
      If you show the ability to Role-play well, and seem to have a grasp for fiction
      generation, then you might very well be suited to become a Seer. The Seers are appointed
      from a pool of players who have shown the ability to role-play and stay in-character in
      the face of adversity. The players that catch an IGM or Seer's attention will be sent an
      application, which will require them to write some fiction and display their role-playing
      ability. If the IGMs feel that this person will make a strong Seer, then the position will
      be offered to the applicant. Simply asking to become a Seer is not the best way to go
      about becoming one. If you're a writer, write stories about your character to the various
      message-boards. If you're good with organization, join or start a role-playing guild. Take
      whatever it is you do well, and use that in a role-playing situation. Get involved in the
      UO community, create a town or tavern. Work in the game to support existing role-playing
      venues in a visible way. Help to build community in a way, which not only provides an
      outlet for dedicated &quot;hard-core&quot; role-players, but allows the inexperienced
      role-players to get involved. The most important thing to remember is to be inclusive, not
      exclusive. These activities will get you noticed in a positive way, give you practice at
      staying in character, and are quite fun. Even if it doesn't get you an invitation to
      become a Seer, doing these things will make your time in UO a lot more engaging and
      rewarding.</font></small></p>

    <small>Sith was at it again with the U:A bits. Looks like Lady Moi was back to <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>dish out more lovin</strong></font>. First she jumped on this
    question about any music from the game being released any time soon.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p></i><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Yup. We're going to try to
      do that as soon as possible. We're waiting to get some of the finished bits back. :)</font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>Then she go's on to talk about the Direct 3D version of the game.</small></p>
    <i><blockquote>
      <p></i><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Bill's got a busy day of
      meetings. (A moment of silence, please.) But he was kind enough to forward me a quick

      <br>
      &quot;Answer: D3D still expected to look just like Glide. Existing screen shots should
      look the same under either Glide or D3D</font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>This time she go's into Camera behavior etc.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p></i><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">In an isometric game, when
      yer char turns left or right, the camera sees you in profile. In Ascension, the camera
      will always be behind your head. So if you look right, the camera will swing right. If the
      avatar turns left, the camera will move left.</font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>And finally an important one. She talks about the importance of fan feedback and
    how you chimps need to keep on posting goods to the boards. This is the Net gang..we can
    make a big difference in how a game can turn out. I've seen the results myself.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p></i><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">All your input does make a
      difference, and the team appreciates the time you take to share your thoughts here on
      these forums.<br>
      <br>
      In some cases, the suggestions only require a slight modification of the existing system,
      or are already in place... in some cases, the suggestions are thought to be quite good,
      but are unable to be implemented, as bluehair states, at this stage of development.<br>
      <br>
      However, that doesn't mean you should stop making the suggestions. So what if the idea
      doesn't make it into Ascension.. the developers are reading your posts and probably are
      influenced by the suggestions and ideas they read here. Maybe one of your ideas becomes a
      part of Ultima X. :)</font></small></p>

    has been updated with <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>some new info from Lady Moi</strong></font>.
    This time, she looks at the handicapped accesibility of the game.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Bill's been busy, so
      I'm posting for him...<br>
      <br>
      &quot;First, our interface is designed to be HIGHLY configurable. You can assign any key
      to any game command. So, you can move forward with either the mouse button, or an arrow
      key.<br>
      <br>
      Some commands, however, will probably require the mouse button. For instance, the left
      mouse button is designed to select or use the object it's pointing at. And we currently
      aren't able to map a key press onto that; you have to actually use the mouse button.<br>
      <br>
      This is a 3D game. But, it's not a dexterity test like other 3D games. The movement
      through the world is meant to be intuitive and simple, not requiring lots of key
      combinations. But, our movement is designed to work the mouse button and some other keys,
      in combination, requiring at least two fingers. Combat, especially, would be a problem for
      someone not able to pull this off quickly.<br>
      <br>
      So, in short, much of the game would be playable, no problem. But there are definitely
      areas that will be difficult, such as combat.<br>
      <br>
      Might I suggest a speech recognition solution? There are programs out there that will
      &quot;stuff&quot; keypresses into the PC's keyboard buffer based on speech commands, which
      &quot;fool&quot; the application into thinking a key has been pressed. Your friend might
      be able to use this in conjunction with the mouse or other keys to make combat more
      playable. For example, if ALT-left-arrow is meant to make the Avatar side-step to the
      left, your friend might be able to press the left arrow key and say &quot;Side&quot; to
      &quot;press&quot; the ALT key, making the Avatar side-step as desired. Just a thought. I
      can't recommend a specific Speech Recognizer at this time, I haven't worked with them for
      several years.</font></small></p>
