    <small>Typical Sunday kids. Not much in the land of RPG's at the moment. However with that
    said, there is still plenty to do. (Uh oh, another Sacrates rant on non RPG's) Sin's
    taking the heat for it's early release and I agree. I stopped playing the single player
    version until they fix the incredibly sickening load times. But the Multiplayer version is
    absolutely phenominal. Best level design I have ever seen in an FPS. Shogo is just plain
    old fun. Level design is a joke, but the story is great and overall playability is there.
    Now that the Carnivores demo is out I forgot about Trespasser. Carnivores has me hooked at
    the moment. Very realistic hunting experience here, even if your hunting Dinos. I am
    absolutely going to get the full version. <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>This could be a
    surprise hit in the making</strong></font>. Kings Quest should be here in the next few
    weeks also which is exciting news for those that are fans of the series. (me) And finally,
    Half Life is just days away gang. No matter who you are, no matter what type of games you
    like, this game is for everyone who enjoys playing PC Games. It will change the way we
    play games in many ways take my word for it.</small></p>

    <small>Here's a piece I neglected to throw up when I saw it a few weeks ago. Anyway, was
    just over at Desslock's who also missed it and slapped that bastard up. So I thought<font color="#FFFFFF"><strong> i'd jump on the train too</strong></font> since this isn't a bad
    looking game at all. We also have an Interview with these guys in our Interview section so
    stop by and check it. Also stop by and check <a href="http://pern.grolier.co.uk/wip/wip151098.asp">their Site </a>out.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">We are constantly
      playing with the player character statistics and get the world to recognise you have them.
      This is going to need some fine tuning right up to the last minute. For instance, you have
      a charisma stat, this can change depending on the way you play through the game. We have
      configured the dialogue so you have multiple responses when talking to the characters, so
      if you begin to take a hostile route when you talk to the NPC's, your charisma rating will
      fall and you will become very unpopular around Pern. If you are polite and helpful then
      your charisma setting will go up and people will adhere to you. A good example is that
      near the beginning of the game, you meet a woman who has lost her son in some dark caves.
      If you rescue her little boy, you will be rewarded, your character rating will be enhanced
      and the people of Pern will begin to hear about you and you begin to build a good
      reputation.</font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">You can also search many of the
      bookcases, these reveal skins, objects, many things that will help you in your quest. You
      can spend a great deal of time reading skins, I'm going to include as much information as
      I possibly can, as you're all aware, this amounts to a great deal. Its not essential to
      read this to complete the game but it gives you the added option to research Pern if you
      want to, especially if you are not familiar with Anne's world.</font></small><font color="#ffffff"></p>

      the fact that Save Games are incompatible in the patch, has not made BIS anymore friends,
      so I am looking for a compromise. A user E-mailed me with an idea last night that we are
      currently looking into. We are seeing if we can create a utility that will take your
      character from an old Save Game and start him at the beginning of the patched game. He
      wouldn't have his items or reputations (these can potentially screw up scripts), but would
      have all his other stats. We are also thinking of giving the character an Extra $500 or
      $1000 in cash per level he has to make buying stuff easy. </font></small></p>

    running miles screaming Obscenities the whole time! Asheron's Call at the time had a much
    better navigation system similar to the Old Ultima Underworld mouse system. It was
    excellent. EQ's was clunky and very inefficient. </small></p>

    Unless of course this ongoing fast impresses Brad so much that he sends me a notification
    along with God-Like abilities in the game. Come on Brad, i'm starting to feel like Ghandi
    here. (Actually the worst part is that i'm starting to look like him too!) Anyway, John
    Smedley (Director of PC Development) actually posted a bit on the boards about the

    <small>3DNews slipped up a Bubbalicious Interview with the Pimps working on Gorky 17. (Not

    <small>Ken Levine was <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>back in action Starsky and Hutch Style</strong></font>
    on the SS Boards. Had a few words to say on the Interface. Check it.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Today, myself Xemu and Jon (the
      lead programmer and project leader, respectively) had a meeting on this exact issue (as
      I've mentioned before, we've been refining the interface over the last few weeks). There
      are actually _3_ ways to reload a weapon. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">1) through the inventory </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">2) through the ammo box in the
      lower right hand corner (it's really not small, probably over an inch square at least) </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">3) through (remappable) hot keys </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Our philosophy is to give people
      redundant ways of doing things. And then let them customize it. No one, except the user,
      can make a perfect interface. We want to provide the tools to make even a rich game like
      Shock eminently playable, even to the novice. </font></small></p>

    <small>Gamespot UK slipped up a little paragraph on Silver which we haven't seen or <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>heard from in quite a while</strong></font>. Read up on it right
    here. (VN)</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Here's a game that disappeared
      off the edge of the earth, or so it seemed. In development for several years, the last
      time we saw it was 1996 and then all went quiet ­ until a month ago. Then it suddenly
      reappeared as a Final Fantasy VII-style action-adventure with cutesy cartoon-style
      characters and a swords and sorcery story line. And the one big difference between it and
      Squaresoft's famous offering is that the combat in Silver is real-time as opposed to
      turn-based. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Silver is an evil emperor and he
      decides to round up all women of child-bearing age. Your task, as the main character
      David, is to find out just what he is up to and, eventually, stop him. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The game is beautiful to behold
      with around 350 individual scenes all featuring stylish backdrops, while some of the
      indoor views have a weird 3D top-down view that allows David to climb stairs and move
      about all on the one screen. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">There are 52 characters and
      character types to interact with and while some will help you with useful bits of
      information or some strong-arm support, there are many of the emperor's cronies to battle
      with. Control is by mouse ­ you point where you want to go and left-click to go there,
      double-clicking to go there faster. Right-clicking brings up a comprehensive cyclical menu
      giving you access to your inventory, spells, weapons and so on. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Real-time combat is simple to
      control to and happens relatively slowly, so you're not floundering around aimlessly
      hoping to hit your enemy. It is mouse-activated ­ hold down the Ctrl key then press the
      left mouse button and swing forward to thrust, swish left and right to slash in those
      directions or pull back to do a nifty reverse turn thrust. Right-clicking while holding
      Ctrl raises your shield. Picking up items is easy using a mouse drag and select system for
      multiple objects. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">It's been a while in the making,
      but we like the look of Silver around these parts.</font></small></p>
