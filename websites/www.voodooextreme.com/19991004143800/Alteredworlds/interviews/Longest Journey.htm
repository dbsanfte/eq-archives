    </strong><small>By the Sultan of Smack:<a href="mailto:sacrates@voodooextreme.com">
    Sacrates</a></small><br>
    <small>With: Ragnar Tornquist (Producer)</small></em></p>
    <p align="left"><small><em>There are games that come along from time to time that really
    capture the imagination and not let it go. A game that </em>immerses<em> you in a world
    that seems so real you can't tell the difference from where you sit and what you see
    before you on the screen. The Longest Journey being made by Funcom is one of these games.
    Enjoy the screenshots we have dished out for you and sit back, relax and let Sacrates and
    Ragnar caress your brains with some goodness that is called &quot;The Longest
    Journey&quot;. </em></small></p>
    <hr>
    <p align="left"><font color="#8080C0">Sacrates: </font>Let's get the typical stuff out of
    the way first and tell the Altered readers who you are, what you do and what the meaning
    of life is.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">Ragnar: </font>My name is Ragnar Tornquist, and I'm the producer,
    writer and lead designer of The Longest Journey (TLJ), which is being developed by Funcom
    here in Oslo, Norway. My &quot;oeuvre&quot; so far includes Casper for the Sega Saturn and
    Playstation, published by Interplay, and I've dipped my toe into a couple of other Funcom
    projects during my four years with the company, but TLJ has basically occupied my life
    from dawn to dusk the past two-and-a-half years. As for the meaning of life? Doing what
    you love and getting paid for doing it. Which I'm lucky enough to have learned first-hand.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">Sacrates:</font> Well, this game is a visual feast for the eyes.
    Let's hit some engine related questions. Could you give an idea what type of system we'll
    be needing and what will run at good frame rates in high res.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">Ragnar: </font>TLJ runs perfectly on my P2-400! The game is a visual
    feast, true, but it's not a hog; it actually scales well to most hardware, though the
    minimum spec will probably be a P-166 with some kind of hardware acceleration. In
    software-only mode (Direct3D), you'll probably need a P200-MMX to get an acceptable
    framerate, but it depends on what you're able to live with in terms of performance.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">Sacrates: </font>What kind of V2 features will you be using in the
    game? What kinds of bells and whistles can we expect. What types of 3D effects will we be
    seeing?<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">Ragnar: </font>As far as V2-specific features, we're not doing
    anything too flashy; mostly, the V2 will provide smoother framerates, better lighting,
    prettier textures and a general feeling of bliss! There aren't any lensflares or gigantic
    explosions -- it just ain't that kind of game. But the V2 will enable you to play using
    the high-polygon version of April, the lead character, and I'd say that's reward enough.
    As for 3D effects, we're using dynamic, coloured lighting, and real-time shadows (which
    are just as detailed as the characters themselves), and we might throw in a couple of
    surprises for the game's release. You'll just have to wait and see.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">Sacrates:</font> About how much of the game is 2D and what is 3D?
    Will 3D be used to improve frame rates and such similar to what Diablo 2 is doing?<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">Ragnar:</font> It's about 50/50 in terms of 2D and 3D (think
    Resident Evil 2, Grim Fandango). All the backgrounds, environmental animations and objects
    are in 2D, while the characters and vehicles are in 3D. However, the entire game is, in a
    way, 3D, since all the scenes have been created in 3D-Studio MAX 2.0 and exported using
    our proprietary tools into the game-engine. This allows the real-time characters to be lit
    perfectly in relation to the backgrounds, and to be scaled and Z-buffered (i.e. move in
    front of and behind objects depending on where they are on the floor) while still
    preserving the complexity of the original, pre-rendered scenes. Considering the complexity
    of the backgrounds, it'll be a few years before real-time<br>
    technology is up to the task of doing it all in real-time; we wanted a very<br>
    detailed, very textured, very REAL world in which to place our characters, and this
    technology allowed us to do that very well.<br>
    <font color="#8080C0"><br>
    Sacrates: </font>How detailed will the NPC AI be? Will they have lives of their own or
    will they be at preset locations in the game?<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">Ragnar:</font> Since TLJ is an adventure-title with a heavily
    scripted plot, the characters will appear at preset locations. However, some characters --
    e.g. pedestrians, waitresses in taverns -- are controlled by semi-random<br>
    parameters, making them look a little less scripted than what we're used to seeing in
    adventure-games. But mainly it's a very controlled world, although that doesn't mean it's
    predictable. Unless you play it twice, that is.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">Sacrates:</font> What type of NPC interaction will there be? Will it
    be pre written scripted stuff or will there be branching dialogue?<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">Ragnar: </font>Most dialogues having a branching structure, and
    unless you play the game 3-4 times you'll never hear all the dialogue. What you say, and
    how you treat, certain characters, will have an impact on the gameplay. Being rude to
    someone in Chapter One may cause you problems later on, and while you can never &quot;get
    stuck&quot;, you might have to find alternative solutions to problems. Most characters
    also have an extensive database of information on other characters, locations and
    inventory-items, and you'll be able to ask them about all these things, provided you know
    what to ask about. Not everything is relevant to solving the puzzles; a lot of it is there
    just to provide a detailed setting, to establish relationships and conflicts, and to allow
    the player the ability to explore and experience beyond the boundaries of the plot. I'd
    say in terms of character interaction TLJ is more comparable to a game like the first
    Gabriel Knight than a lot of more recent adventures --<br>
    the dialogues are very, very important.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">Sacrates:</font> How will the story be told? Will there be scripted
    sequences using the actual game engine (ie. Half Life) or will it be pre-rendered
    cinematic sequences.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">Ragnar: </font>A good mix of both, really. I'm a big fan of the
    game-engine type of story sequences, as they tend to be less intrusive on the flow of the
    game, and there will be a lot of those. However, to create really atmospheric, emotional
    moments, and to surprise the player, we're also including over 20 minutes of pre-rendered
    FMV. Mostly, though, the player will need to &quot;discover&quot; the story on her own,
    through dialogues, books, general observation, and even through dreams.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">Sacrates:</font> One of my personal favorite questions now is sound
    support. What type of sound will you be using in the game? Will you have SB Live support
    at all? Will you be taking advantage of 3D sound?<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">Ragnar: </font>Sound is one of the areas where we've been investing
    a lot of time and effort. We've had an in-house musician working full-time on the music
    for over 2 years, creating a very atmospheric, very cinematic score, and we also have one
    man dedicated, full-time, to doing the sound-effects. As for 3D-sound, we looked into
    doing it at the very beginning, but since our camera is fixed it won't really be very
    effective except for spot-effects, so we've limited ourselves to panning and fading. We
    support DirectSound, but no specific hardware. The quality in our audio is in the actual
    music and sound, and not in the real-time processing of it.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">Sacrates: </font>What type of RPG Elements do you think will be in
    the game? Will there be typical stuff like Inventory etc?<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">Ragnar: </font>Inventory, branching dialogues, books to read,
    potions to mix, items to<br>
    manipulate, monsters to beat, ancient mysteries to uncover...we've got it<br>
    all. There is no actual combat, however -- April, our heroine, prefers<br>
    brains to brawns -- and there are no stats to improve. TLJ is, for the<br>
    better part of the game, a pure adventure.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">Sacrates:</font> What kind of Audience are you looking to attract
    with The Longest Journey? RPGers, Adventure gamers etc?<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">Ragnar: </font>I'd love to say &quot;everybody&quot;, but
    unfortunately, that'll never happen. You can't please all the people all the time. First
    and foremost, we're making a game that adventure-players (like me, and most of the TLJ
    team) will love -- this is a true point-and-click adventure with all the latest bells and
    whistles -- and hopefully hardcore RPG-players will be intrigued by the immense detail in
    the two worlds (one of magic, one of science), and the number of characters you meet and
    interact with. Additionally, I think this is a game that's more accessible to the casual
    player than most PC-games, as it's pretty forgiving (you can't die), requires no hand-eye
    co-ordination to speak of, looks beautiful, and has a very complex, very involving story.
    If you're only into first-person shooters, or fighting-games, or RTS-games, this may not
    be your cup of tea. But, then again, why not try something new?<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">Sacrates: </font>Out of all these great features we see with your
    game how do you think the game sticks out and possibly breaks news ground?<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">Ragnar:</font> Technologically, we're doing a lot of interesting
    stuff, especially for an adventure-game (historically the least tech- and feature-driven
    genre) -- like high-polygon characters, dynamic, coloured lighting, detailed shadows, a
    skeletal animation-system with real-time interpolation, lip-synching -- but where we break
    new ground, so to speak, is in the sheer size and complexity of our worlds, the quality of
    the graphics, and the complexity of the story. We really have built two (plus one --
    you'll just have to wait and see) worlds from the ground up, and we've spent every waking
    moment these past two-and-a-half years doing it. I think people will be really intrigued
    by the setting, and, after that, they'll be engulfed in the storyline, which is a lot more
    adult and &quot;serious&quot; than what most adventure-gamers are used to.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">Sacrates: </font>Is this entirely a puzzle based game? Or will there
    be a lot of interaction with NPC's etc?<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">Ragnar:</font> We have a large variety of puzzles, ranging from
    simple (and not so simple) inventory-based puzzles, to logical puzzles, to
    conversation-based puzzles, and even some action-based puzzles where quick thinking is key
    -- although, as I've said earlier, you can't die. Like I also stated earlier, character
    interaction plays a big part in TLJ, as does exploration, as does a general sense of
    curiosity. The puzzles are all integrated -- I hope -- well into the story, so the player
    should never feel like she's just &quot;unlocking doors&quot; to get to the next location.
    It's a puzzle-based game, sure, but not like Myst was a puzzle game. TLJ is first and
    foremost an adventure.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">Sacrates: </font>What is your opinion of the 3D market at the
    moment? What do you expect to see or be doing in the next few years in terms of 3D
    technology?<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">Ragnar:</font> The next generation of adventure-games -- two to
    three years from now -- will, graphically, be doing what TLJ is doing now, but in
    real-time. In other words, realistic, detailed environments where the freedom to explore
    is almost boundless. The challenge lies in presenting the world to the player in an
    interesting way, eschewing the first-person perspective for something more cinematic, with
    dynamic cameras, staged scenes, reaction-shots, engine-driven story-sequences; a living,
    breathing environment where the player still has the ability to move at will at all times,
    and to react to everything that's going on while it's going on. 3D will also allow genres
    to merge better; the pure-bred point-and-click adventure-game is on the way out, making
    way for games that mix and match genres to provide a much more interesting and
    well-rounded gaming experience. 3D will allow us to do this, and that's a good thing. Not
    because the adventure-genre is stale and old-hat; quite the opposite, actually. The
    building-stones of a good adventure -- exploration, conversation, manipulation of the
    environment, and puzzles -- are found in most modern games, from RPGs to action-titles. 3D
    allows us to take down the walls between genres, and to work towards that perfect gaming
    experience.<br>
    <br>
    As you can see, I have been thinking about this for a while ;)<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">Sacrates:</font> Also in terms of 3D, what do you think of the new
    3D sound cards like SB Live etc and do you expect that to be a big part of the experience?<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">Ragnar:</font> Definitely, yeah. The next generation of PC games --
    and even some recent and upcoming releases, like Half-Life -- will pay more attention to
    sound than ever before, and it's about time. Sound is one of the areas developers have
    been ignoring, which is a shame, because, done right, sound can add so much to the
    experience. Expect to see 3D sound play a big part in games in the future, as well as
    sound modeling -- modifying sounds in real-time based on environmental factors such as
    space, texture, humidity, etc.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">Sacrates: </font>About what percent of your game is complete now?
    When can we expect to see this game in stores?<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">Ragnar: </font>We're about 75% complete at the moment, and we're
    looking at a release somewhere in the first quarter of next year. That said, we're taking
    our time to do this right -- we're not going to rush it out the door. So no definite
    release-date as of this moment.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">Sacrates: </font>About how many hours do expect the average gamer to
    put behind The Longest Journey? You would think with a name like that quite a few?<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">Ragnar:</font> Hopefully -- though it is difficult to tell at this
    stage -- the average gamer will spend about 30-40 hours with &quot;The Longest
    Journey&quot;. There's certainly enough to look at, listen to, read and experience to keep
    someone busy for at least that long. An experienced player who's simply intent on getting
    through as fast as possible (with a finger on the escape-key) might do it in 10-15 hours.
    But, again, it's difficult to tell. At any rate, it's certainly not a small game, with
    over 120 locations and 50 speaking characters to interact with.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">Sacrates: </font>The game looks very cinematic looking at many of
    the current screenshots. Can we expect to find changing music in relation to what is
    happeing in the game or will it be preset music to the current level or area we're in.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">Ragnar: </font>To some degree, yeah, the music will reflect your
    current situation, but since the game is heavily scripted, the music is not really
    &quot;interactive&quot;. That said, we don't have background music playing all the time
    (something that can soon get quite irritating); music is there to provide a
    &quot;punch&quot; in specific locations, specific situations, and so it doesn't really
    have to be very interactive as long as it appears on cue. Which it does. When you least
    expect it.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">Sacrates: </font>So with all that said, how do you feel The Longest
    Journey will stick out in todays market? What do you expect to really blow us away with?<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <font color="#8080C0">Ragnar: </font>I think I've probably said more than enough already,
    so I'll be short and to the point; incredible graphics, cool technology, and a story
    that's not just a rehash of your basic
    recover-the-ancient-artefact-and-destroy-the-evil-wizard storyline. And fun puzzles. And a
    heroine with attitude. And...well, you'll have to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wait and see.<br>
