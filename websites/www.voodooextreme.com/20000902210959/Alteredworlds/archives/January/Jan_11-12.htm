    <small><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Holy Christ on a Jolly Roger!</strong></font> Finally
    we're actually getting some news on another one of the big massive multiplayer games
    coming up. I would love to send you guys as much news of this gem as possible but alas,
    there is none. Their really keeping this thing deeper in the closet than Richard Simmons.
    Not to mention the site that's doing the <a href="http://www.gamestream.net/previews/displaypreview.cfm?PReviewID=37">Preview</a> has

    <small>As you've noticed the news has been very staggered lately. No I haven't started
    doing Yoga. No i'm not secretly dealing drugs. And no i'm not a closet Hanson fan. But
    yes, I have been playing Everquest non stop since I got it. I will get back on track with
    things soon, but right now let me ask you a question: If you had the opportunity to play
    Everquest Beta for as long as possible or post news on a Web page<font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>
    what would you do?</strong></font> Get my drift now? With that said, i'm starting to
    allocate my time a little more efficiently around this so things should kick back in gear

    24 hour marathon of BG Multiplayer they recently had. <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Makes

    <small>Someone must have been looking at the wrong charts. From what I just read over at
    Desslock's, the console lovin monkeys over at Next Gen say that Heat.net have claimed that
    BG is the second most popular online title other than Quake 2. I don't know about you but
    I get as much satisfaction from playing BG online as I do <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>getting
    my Testicles tied to a rock and thrown out the window</strong></font>. (Although i'm sure
    there are some out there who enjoy these types of escapades.) Anyway, read this.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">This could be the
      start of &quot;role playing night with the pals.&quot; And with BG scorching the charts on
      HEAT, it seems the idea may be catching on. With the proliferation of multiplayer-only,
      persistent world RPGs, the question is which model will win -- or whether they will
      coexist peacefully.</font></small></p>

    <small>Abashi just doesn't know when to quit today does he? He was back on the boards
    giving everybody <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>the Jiffy Lube on EQ</strong></font>. This
    first one is on circle straffing in EQ.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"><small>You can sidestep all you like,
      but it will never result in an NPC missing you and running by. It isn't that type of game.
      </small></font></p>
      <p><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"><small>On the other hand, I think
      perfecting the circle-strafe will be *very* important for +PvP Rogues.</small></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>A bit on spoilers etc.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Someone theoreticially in the
      beta could ask someone in game, for instance, a guide. Of course, Guides won't spoil
      in-game either, so this person may have to ask some fellow testers. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Yes, even if you are in game
      there are spoilers. We don't tell people in game anything they should be able to find out
      on thier own.</font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>And a little mini Interview for ya.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">: Second, you didnt talk about
      dueling. Its really the only way to get around the 4 level limit, right?* So a few
      questions... </font></small></p>
      <p><strong><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Yes, dueling goes around
      the 4 level limit. </font></small></strong></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">: 1. Does it affect your
      faction/reputation? </font></small></p>
      <p><strong><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Not sure about this, I'll
      check into it. Dying always effects the faction standing of the one dying, but I'm not
      sure about the killer. Dueling has always been considered an honorable way to kill, so I
      doubt factions would be affected adversely, but I'll look into it. </font></small></strong></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">: 2. Can you flee without
      penalties? </font></small></p>
      <p><strong><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Yes, but you must leave
      the zone which then broadcasts your cowardice for the whole world to see. </font></small></strong></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">: 3. Are there any limits on
      looting? </font></small></p>
      <p><strong><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">No looting allowed in
      duels. </font></small></strong></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">: 4. Can it include more than 2
      people? (I know that goes against the use of the word *duel*, but just asking.) </font></small></p>
      <p><strong><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">No, dueling is just
      1-on-1. </font></small></strong></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">: *by the way is it four levels
      higher and lower, or just two levels high/low for a total of four? </font></small></p>
      <p><strong><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">4 higher or lower,
      basicially an 8 level spread but I didnt' want to confuse people.</font></small></strong></p>

    <small>Even though the server is acting like a Ho right now, i'm gonna slap up this very
    important post from Abashi to amuse and abuse you. Been wondering about the fate of the
    dreaded PK switch? (<font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>You can't possibly understand how much I
    love this thing</strong></font>!!!!) Also they have some shots from Monday Madness last
    night tht looks like a convention of clones over at <a href="http://con.crossroadsrpg.com/">CoN</a>.</small><font face="Arial" color="#C1C1FF"><strong>
    </strong></font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">1. The PK Switch </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">It's not going away. The only
      people who a PvP person will be able to fight will be other people who have chosen to be
      PvP or have chosen to duel. Gone are the days of being able to kill people who don't want
      to engage in it. There will be no &quot;PK Days&quot; where everyone is PvP for a few
      hours, or a day, or a week every 2 months. There will be no special advantages for those
      who choose to play PvP. There will be no limitations on levels, advancement, or weapons
      for those who chose to abstain from it. No one will *ever* be forced to engage in PvP
      against thier will. No one will ever be involuntarily switched PvP as a punishment for an
      attitude problem. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">If you wish to engage in PvP with
      other like-minded individuals, EverQuest will provide you a forum in which you can do
      that. However if the only way you will enjoy PvP is to kill people who want nothing to do
      with it, EverQuest will never provide that. </font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>Sacrates suddenly wants to give Abashi some manly loving for that!! Bravo 989!!!
    Bravo!! Ok on with the rest of the post.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">2. PK vs. Anti-PK. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Neither of these exist in
      EverQuest based on the modern definition. You are all PvP. PvP people will account for all
      races and classes in the game. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">3. Killing out-of-character </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Those PvP persons who chose to
      kill outside the racial and deity hatreds that exist in the land will find themselves
      without a home. Sorry, but that is how it is. Kill in-character and go home to find
      yourself a hero with your faction and associates. Kill out-of-character and go home to
      find a guard wishing to bury his longsword in your skull. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">4. One Shot Kills </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Gone are the one-shot-kills or
      the 20 second battles some might be used to. If you want to kill someone it's going to
      take time, and chances are that they will have to be just as willing to fight you as you
      are them when you meet. The level-limit (currently 4 levels) on PvP combat pretty much
      insures that no one will ever take anyone else out in one shot. If you are solo and the
      target decides soon enough in the fight that they want to get away rather than fight,
      count on them to be able to do so. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">5. Grouping PvPers </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">I pity anyone who tries to solo a
      +PvP person be they magic, melee, or otherwise. As a solo PvP you will be USDA Prime for
      any group of PvPers that come your way. Not to mention your back will be unguarded when
      that Orc has got you down to 20% health, or when you are sitting on your backside regening
      health or mana. Healing and medding PvPers will be prime targets for other PvPs looking
      for an easy kill. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">6. Best Class for PvP </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Forget about it. There isn't one.
      Per #5, You are dead meat if you try to solo as a PvPer. You need a group, and like any
      group, PvP groups need to be well balanced as well. One on one is just too unpredictable.
      As a Wizard I will nuke you. As a Necromancer I will suck the life out of you while
      poisoning you from within. As a magician I'll nuke you and make you a playtoy for my pet.
      As an enchanter I'll just charm you and &quot;introduce&quot; you to a local Guard or
      wandering giant. As a cleric I'll thump you while healing myself. As a druid I'll nuke you
      while thumping on you and healing myself, same with the Shaman. As an SK I'll harmtouch
      you and suck the life out of you. As a paladin I'll lay hands on myself and heal myself
      proper as well. As a ranger I'll thump you with dual blades while you *try* to hit me and
      while I heal myself, and if things go bad I'll just disappear into the wilderness and
      sneak up on you later. As a rogue I will surprise you when you see how easy it is for me
      to circle behind you. As a bard you will find me swinging at you faster than anyone else.
      As a warrior or monk, I'll show you what it *really* means to be thumped. Did I miss any? <br>
      Any questions?</font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>Also, here's a bit on the 4 level difference you need to PKill.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The 4-level thing was almost
      unanimously agreed upon by the &quot;notorios PK's&quot; currently in the beta. It was
      cited as one thing that needed to go in to make PvP more viable. Quite frankly, much
      outside that 4 level limit, there is really no amount of skill and/or luck that can turn
      the tables against the stats.</font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>Role Playing and Player killing.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">I have heard the roleplay defense
      to massive unrestricted PvP before, I might actually have invented it. The truth is that
      though, yes, the PvP switch does hamper roleplay of racial hatred in that you cannot
      necessarily kill your enemy, it does the greater service of allowing all different
      playstyles to exist in the same world. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">EverQuest is a roleplaying game
      by definition, but that does not mean we can force people to roleplay any more than we
      want to force people to engage in PvP. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Now, if we take your same
      scenario, and if you *both* wish to fight for roleplaying reasons, I suggest you use
      /duel. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">This tool has been provided for
      those who wish to engage in roleplayed PvP without the stigma caused by unrestricted
      full-time PvP.</font></small></p>

    <small>Ok server change is in the process which explains terrible loading times etc. Hold
    your shorts, we'll have it fixed up soon enough. Also, on another note....I hate to be
    right all the time but this Review of <a href="http://www.3dgaming.net/reviews/shooters/starsiege_tribes/">Tribes from 3DGN</a> is
    a must-read. I have yet to actually see a bad review of this game. It's brilliant! I have
    3 games on my hard drive at the moment that I believe are heads and tails beyond anything
    else i've played in recent memory. First is BG, which I sometimes confess to not wanting
    to play because of the terrible lagginess of the client when scrolling. (But overall it's
    a solid RPG) Tribes, which I seriously <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>have a feeling won't
    leave my hard drive for a loooooong time</strong></font>. Finally Everquest which is a no
    brainer. And somebody tell me why I am on this recent ranting crusade? Did someone slip me
    a willy to the drink?! Oh well, i'll get over it....I just need to watch more Gilligan's
    Island reruns to calm down. Check back later when I start to post some news...at the
    moment it serves no purpose with the Server being on the fritz like this.</small></p>

    <small>Sorry gang, we're in the process of moving servers at the moment with VE. Not
    exactly sure what's going on at the moment but I assume it's part of the conversion. It
    takes a serious amount of finagling to even get on the server at the moment so check back
    later for updates. Sorry about this again...<font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>blame it on the

    Granny all buttered up with Ben Gay<font color="#FFFFFF"><strong> riding her Moped down

    with Duncan of Surreal software for you to dig on. </small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style" size="2">Chris O'Brien: What are some of
      the advantages and disadvantages of the Surreal Engine? <br>
      <br>
      Duncan: I can't think of many disadvantages except maybe that it is hardware only. One of
      my favorite things about it after having come from bsp engine stuff like Half-life is that
      it is all real-time. This feature is very cool for a designer because you don't have to
      wait for things to compile. All the geometry and even the lighting is calculated in-game.
      What I see in the editor is also the same as what I get in the game, complete with
      lighting and even any events I may want to have going on. <b><br>
      <br>
      Chris O'Brien: Could you list a few features of the Surreal Engine briefly explaining each
      one?</b></font></p>
      <p><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style" size="2">Duncan: The landscape geometry
      can be layered...it's not a height map, it's as many layers of mesh we need to get
      whatever shapes we are looking for...it's kind of hard to explain even in person how it
      works or the interface for creating it...but it allows us to create natural looking
      environments that can look very strange and entertaining...a mountain that at the top
      turns into a spiraling piece of landscape that supports an island at the top which has
      rivers spilling over the edge down to the mountain is actually pretty easy. The later
      levels use the power of the engine a lot more than the earlier ones. </font></p>

    <small>You will be...you will be.<font color="#FFFFFF"><strong> In the words of the all
    wise and knowing Yoda</strong></font>. One thing about EQ is that it is EASY to get very
    lost. And this is no UO where you can suddenly poof back to any location you want with a
    flip of your finger and a word or two. Nope, if you plan on playing EQ prepare to be very
    lost at&nbsp; first. Only Magic classes have the ability to transport in this game and
    then it is a low level Gate that takes you back to your home location. There will be no
    mass transport system in EQ. All rejoice! Anyway, everquestnews.com have dished up a <a href="http://www.everquestnews.com/Atlas/hallas.gif">map for the City of Halas</a> you'll

    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Hello current eq beta testers and
      future eq beta testers. There is a new event taking place tommorrow night and each and
      every monday night. This event is called &quot;Monday Night Madhouse&quot;. The event will
      take place at 9pm eastern, 8pm central. I am calling On all current eq beta testers to
      help me kick off the inaugural event.</font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Here is how the event will work:</font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">#1. Create a character that is
      good with hand to hand combat.<br>
      #2. No magic users are allowed. (this will change in future).<br>
      #3. Take this character to the priest of Discord in your local town to make him
      &#147;red&#148;, (pkiller)<br>
      #4. Bring your new red character to the Qeynos city gates. This is the meeting place of
      the event.<br>
      </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">As of now, getting a character
      from a far off place will be kind of hard to get to Qeynos, being only a level 1
      character. In the future, I hope to have meeting points where gm&#146;s will be able to
      gate you to the arena.</font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Here is how the event will work:</font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Players will form a big circle,
      all facing each other. Once my character &#147;JarJar&#148; says &#147;Let the madness
      begin&#148;, each player will then proceed to kill any and all other players that are
      playing. There will be officials there to make sure there are no cheaters. The last man
      standing will win the prize.</font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Rules:</font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">#1. No armor!! Please abide by
      this rule.<br>
      #2. No magic.<br>
      #3. All players must be level 1.<br>
      #4. No weapons (might be changed to newbie only weapons)<br>
      </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">In the future I hope to have
      gm&#146;s and guides there for organization. There will also be an entrance fee that will
      be used for prizes. Also I hope to have a championship belt that can be proudly worn by
      The current champion. The prize for the inaugural event should be nice.</font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Please email me at
      jarjar@gtemail.net if you wish to donate something to the prize list. I hope to have the
      official &#147;Monday Night Madhouse&#148; webpage up shortly. I hope to have everyone
      show up and support this event. Lets Get it on!!</font></small></p>

    <small>It's funny to sit back and watch how late these Reviews are compared to most other
    games. Actually all other games. I think that is a tribute to the size of this beast.
    (Yeah I stole that line from my girfriend) 3D Gaming.net have sauced up their own <a href="http://www.3dgaming.net/reviews/rpg/baldurs_gate/">spicey view</a> that you should
    stop by and read. Not to mention seeing a 3D gaming site covering a 2D isometric game<font color="#FFFFFF"><strong> is like seeing the Pope doing the Limbo at the Playboy mansion</strong></font>.</small><font face="Arial" color="#C1C1FF"><strong> </strong></font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">I actually went out
      and bought this game instead of waiting for it to be sent to me for review (as most of my
      games usually are), because I had heard really good things about it. Now, I don't just go
      buying many games, because it's really expensive up here in Canada, and I prefer saving my
      money for... other things. But after having played for... countless hours now, I'm really
      glad I bought it. Not just because it's so much fun to play, and I'm addicted now, but
      because the manuals and reference cards that come with it are extremely useful. I figured
      out most of the stuff on my own, but they're some things I just wouldn't know without
      them. So I'm suggesting right now to anyone that reads this and doesn't own it. Don't burn
      it, not only is that *cough*illegal*cough*, but it's 5 CD's, and the manual and stuff (not
      to mention the makers themselves) are worth spending the dough on. This has been a public
      service announcement from Rob Walker. </font></small></p>
