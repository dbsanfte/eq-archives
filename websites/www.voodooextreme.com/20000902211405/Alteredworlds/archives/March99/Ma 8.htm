    <small>Ouch. <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Excuse the pun on the Subject</strong></font>.
    Anyway Robert Huebner was on the Vampire boards and passing out an extra bit of goodies in
    the game. </small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p></i><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Yeah, I would agree with
      you, Sandman, that the character modeling in Jedi was one of the aspects we could have
      spent more time on. Its an area that we've really focused on for this new engine. In Jedi,
      each character body part was a single &quot;mesh&quot; of polygons, so it was difficult to
      make joints like knees and shoulders to look natural. The system was much better for doing
      'droids than humans. Our lead artist on Vampire, Maarten Kraaijvanger, has really pushed
      us to do better this time. To that end, we support what are called
      &quot;soft-skinned&quot; models, where there can be on single mesh of polygons that is
      stretched over the entire skeleton, so gaps are a thing of the past. We also support
      weighted-vertex skinning, which means that as the bones move, the skin stretches over the
      joint in a more natural way. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Of course the polygon count has
      gone way up too.. In Jedi I think Kyle had around 350 polygons at his highest setting, in
      this game we've got characters that are well over 1000 polygons. We're using skeleton
      animations, of course, so you can expect lots of different animations and unlimited
      interpolation of frames, so the animations are all very fluid and smooth. We also switched
      from 3DStudio to Alias/Maya for modeling, which seems to be a more powerful tool, overall.
      And of course those annoying animation glitches with the joints going the wrong way
      sometimes as in Jedi are history, since the animations are stored in a different format
      now that prevents that sort of error. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">There should be a release soon of
      some downloadable screenshots at high resolution so you can really take a close look at
      the character renders and see for yourself. The combination of the better engine,
      animation, the incredible textures, and accurate 32-bit RGB lighting really make them seem
      realistic in their environments. </font></small></p>

    Here's the latest patch message straight from the game.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">We have found and fixed two major
      bugs with spell casting and the newly implemented &quot;/corpse&quot; command. These fixes
      should account for many of the crashes or disconnects that players were encountering. A
      number of other bugs have been fixed with this patch and are listed below; </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">- 1)Bows were drawing onto the
      user interface overlays and eventually leading to crashing.<br>
      - 2)The newly implemented &quot;/corpse&quot; command was causing players to disconnect
      when used.<br>
      - 3)The Mesmerize effect for Bards and Enchanters has been fixed, and should be working as
      intended.<br>
      - 4)Exiting from the character selection screen, selecting a server, then clicking on the
      &quot;Play EverQuest&quot; button would result in an Illegal Operation.<br>
      - 5)If a character died and his or her starting city was down, it would result in the user
      crashing. Now, instead of crashing, the user will be returned to the character selection
      screen until the starting city comes back on-line.<br>
      - 6)Range weapons that were equipped would not appear on the character model until the
      weapon was activated.<br>
      - 7)When commanding pets, text of pets coordinates would spam the user's chat bar.<br>
      - 8)After jumping into water with a torch equipped, then unequiping and re-equiping it,
      the torch would then activate while under water.<br>
      - 9)When using the &quot;Eye of Zomm&quot; spell, the eye model would only face in one
      direction.<br>
      - 10)While fishing, the player would receive a message that the pole has broken, however,
      the pole was not actually damaged.<br>
      - 11)If the player purchases multiple scrolls of the same spell, only one scroll would
      appear in the character's inventory.<br>
      - 12)Upon consenting another character loot your corpse, the consenting player would
      receive the message, &quot;You are given permission to loot <CHARACTER'S name>corpse&quot;.<br>
      - 13)While riding the ships, no ocean sound could be heard.<br>
      - 14)Display mode settings would not be saved when exiting and re-entering the game.<br>
      - 15)Text overlapping would occur while the spell book was open and the options menu was
      up.<br>
      - 16)Players were able to activate the hot key functions while meditating.<br>
      - 17)When a player was anonymous, and the option menu was up, the character was in fact
      not anonymous.<br>
      - 18)With the Autosplit function enabled, party members would receive money when a fellow
      party member looted his or her corpse.<br>
      - 19)Various grammatical changes were made to the race and class descriptions at the
      character select screen.<br>
      - 20)Placing multiple &quot;stackable&quot; items in the trade screen would result in an
      incorrect number of items on the receivers screen.<br>

    <small>Looks like a new bug popped up two nights ago with the latest patch kids. Here's a

    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Yesterday's patch seems to have
      re-introduced the &quot;Black Screen&quot; bug for some Voodoo2 card users. It you are
      getting an apparent lockup with a black screen after selecting a server and clicking the
      &quot;Play EverQuest&quot; button, you need to delete the &quot;eqopt16.opt&quot; and
      &quot;eqOptions1.opt&quot; files from your EQ directory. As a temporary workaround, if you
      are having this problem you need to return to 640x480 mode before logging out of EQ,
      otherwise you will need to delete those files again. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">If you have this problem, please
      send email with information on your system configuration (especially your Video Card

            is, Sacrates finally got off his (Or got on) finely chiseled milky white ass and updated

            down of what has currently got my attention. Well, as has been the case for the past month
            since playing Phase 3, Everquest has got me hooked like a Crack addict. I've honestly
            tried to play all those other great games out there but right now, there is only one game
            that rules the RPG Online roost. I look forward to seeing you all in the full version and
            continuing my Everquest for big breasted naked Nymphs! If your on P4 now look for Tefe,
            the Dwarven Cleric who always carries a tub of lube with him for those special occasions.</small></small></font></p>
