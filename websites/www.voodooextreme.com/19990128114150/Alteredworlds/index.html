    <small>And Abashi returns to the boards dishing out more of that lubed lovin he always
    sauces up. First he talks a bit on character balance in PvP.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Keep in mind that it is not the
      goal of the dev team to make the classes equal in PvP. They will try, but if comes a
      choice between balancing something in PvE while leaving it horribly weak in PvP, they will
      balance for PvE. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">However, I haven't exactly seen
      this happen yet. There will be no best PvP class. Below is an example of what I think they
      are aiming for in PvP. The comparisons are not necessarily representative of what is in
      game currently. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">For instance, perhaps, at level
      50: </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">A warrior might:<br>
      Outclass Bard<br>
      Go even with a Druid<br>
      Fear a Wizard </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">A Bard might:<br>
      Outclass a Monk<br>
      Go even with a Shaman<br>
      Fear a Ranger </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">A Druid might:<br>
      Outclass a Necromancer<br>
      Go even with a Warrior<br>
      And fear a Shadowknight </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">An Enchanter might:<br>
      Outclass a Wizard<br>
      Go even with a Cleric<br>
      Fear a warrior </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Etc....(again, this is all pulled
      out of thin air) </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The point being, I think they are
      aiming to make sure that there is no one class that beats everything in PvP. Tactics, who
      attacks first, and knowledge of the game will go a long way towards determining PvP
      battles. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">I know enough about the tactics
      in game that I'm pretty sure if handed any class I could beat any other class if I attack
      first on the terrain of my choice in the zone of my choice. I'm relativly certain that I
      would not lose a battle under those circumstances against an equally leveled opponent. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Of course, this is all just my
      opinion...</font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>Ok next it's<font color="#FFFFFF"><strong> time for Guide Sacrates </strong></font>to
    step in and do some bitch slapping because this next guy needs it. First let me show you a
    blurb from his incredibly stupid letter.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Anyone pissed that we have to
      start ALL over again<br>
      in EQ when it goes commercial? I mean shouldn't we be able to keep some stuff?</font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>Just the thought of this guy exploding in a giant spontaneous Combustion of fire
    and dust makes me very happy. Good god, they are letting you Beta test the damn game to
    balance it out for everyone who buys the end result.<font color="#FFFFFF"><strong> Not for
    it to serve your own purposes</strong></font>. Stuff like this drives me nuts. I would
    like to Brand the word Beta on this guys forehead like the Cow that he is to emphasize the
    fact. Get a clue! Ahem, next we have a much more politically correct Guide Abashi.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Please keep in mind that Phase 4
      participation is voluntary and a privilege. No one is telling you that you have to go
      build a character up only to have it deleted in a month. If you choose to do this, it is
      completely up to you. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">We do welcome the Phase 4

    <small>And the band plays on in the ongoing development of Middle Earth. This has <font
    color="#FFFFFF"><strong>got a lot of people in a frenzy </strong></font>and I feel for the
    devlopers of this game because of the love people have over this stuff. I pity the fools
    who decide to go and do a Star Trek Massive Multiplayer game. With that said here's some
    goodness for ya. First Stephen Nichols talking about the Economy.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0"><small>I am not in favor of a totally PC
      driven economy, it really is not practical. However, there will be advantages to being a
      PC craftsman (or shopping from one). PC craftsmen will be the main source for specialized
      items in the world. You will never go to a NPC shop to buy mithril chain armor for
      instance. While you can stop by a NPC shop and buy some items of average to good quality,
      you'll get a better price from a PC craftsman or vendor (and probably better quality too).
      </small></font></p>
      <p><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0"><small>It's a noble idea to believe that
      players can run their own economy, but it simply is not true of the masses. Oh no, there's
      the &quot;M&quot; word again. Certainly there will be many players who run shops and
      create goods for sale (we have an extensive system for this), but the majority of players
      will NOT do that. Look at the two extremes on the board that we have already... on one
      hand we've got the super hard-core RPG players who want ultra-realism. On the other hand
      we've got Eugene (and the hundreds of thousands of players in between). Those two sets of
      players do not mix in a player-run system of any kind. We need fail-safe systems to deal
      with the volatile nature of these polar opposite players. Don't get me wrong, we are
      making the game to support player extended economy, but not a totally player-driven
      economy. </small></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>And the all important weapons balancing act.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Just having different weapon
      skills does not add a whole lot to the game unless there are obvious advantages and
      disadvantages to each weapon. Each weapon should be balanced. By that I mean that each
      weapon needs to have a valid use in combat. If you use a warhammer, you're gonna be slow
      and easy to hit after a missed strike. Likewise, if you use a dagger, you'll be much
      faster and be able to hit many times. Beyond that simple concept there is the issue of
      weapon vs. armor balancing. If you are wearing chain armor against someone carrying a
      spear, you've got pretty good protection. If your opponent is wielding a warhammer, you'd
      be at a disadvantage if struck. Our goal as the designers is to create a use for every
      weapon so that warriors can't just pick the &quot;best&quot; one. There can be no
      &quot;best&quot; one in general, just the best one for the job. </font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>And some various spewage for ya.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Why do people say that UO has
      failed?! That game is consistently bringing in at least $1,000,000 a month and is not
      slowing down as far as our information shows. That's a damn good success so far as I can
      tell. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">What's with this elite attitude?
      Did you know that the &quot;casual player&quot; outnumbers the hard-core player many times
      over? If you doubt this, why did Deer Hunter do so well?! While we're not making
      Middle-earth/Deer Hunter, we must make the game palatable to a broad range of people. For
      us to make money, we must focus on an acceptable middle ground... not on one relatively
      small group of players. While we can not please everyone, we'll please as many as we can. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">For you to even suggest that we
      should not be here to make some money is just insanity. That is exactly why we are here.
      My family's propsperity rests solely on my ability to create games that make money for
      this company. We are not in business just to make games for free. As if. This is America,
      yes?! lol Just insanity! Money IS the reason WHY we are making MMORPGs. If it was'nt we
      would not be here at all. (Nor would anyone else)</font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Our goal is to provide a
      Middle-earth based sandbox, if you will. With lots of things to do and try, but with no
      particular order or story IMPOSED on any players. But we are also filling the void that
      all other MMORPGS have fallen victim to. That would be the lame quests and absence of
      system-driven gameplay that so many players require to have purpose. Our goal is to
      provide both of the aspects of gameplay to our customers so that each player's style of
      play is accomodated. And it is indeed a Herculean task. </font></small></p>

    <small>Quite a few people have been wondering just how important the Party is in EQ. Let
    me give you this short story so you get a good idea of just how important it is. This is
    the story of Tefe, a Cleric with a Holy Hammer big enough to make even Monica Lewinsky
    blush. First I shout across the zone looking for other adventurers around my level and get
    3 responses. I head on over to Crush Bone to do a little Orc bashing. The others are
    already there and waiting, since I got lost 3 times on the way there damnit. We gather
    ourselves and let 3 others join in the fun. So there we are standing at the Entrance to
    Crush Bone, a kick ass group of level 8 to 11 Characters. Feeling incredibly good about
    ourselves we head into the zone ready for anything except a naked Ogre. In that case we
    would run like the wind. We head straight over to the big Orc Camp to the West and find
    ourselves in Combat with 2 Orc Slavers and a Legionarre. This is when all hell breaks
    loose on screen. I am watching the health of all 6 members of our party while bashing the
    skull of an Orc myself. Of course this is the perfect time to scream my favorite War chant<font
    color="#FFFFFF"><strong> &quot;Bend over and take it like an Orc!&quot;</strong></font>.
    Feeling much better after releasing my scream I start healing our Barbarian since he is
    taking the brunt of the heat. The incredible thing is that there is so much killing going
    on you just sit there watching &quot;You have gained party experience&quot; the whole
    time. By the end of a good session of that You can easily gain half an experience bar. If
    I were to have done that Solo I wouldn't have even gained a bubble in that amount of time.
    This is the true joy of playing Everquest. It's an incredibly social experience. Unlike UO
    which was an incredibly Anti-social experience. Hope that gives a fair explanation on that
    situation. </small></p>

    <small>As always, Harvey &quot;Witchboy&quot; Smith dishes out<font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>
    his own skewed perspective</strong></font> of games, gaming and that strange game he's
    working on called Deus Ex. Here's the bite straight from the<a
    href="http://www.stormtroopers.com/witchboy/"> monkeys mouth</a>.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p></i><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">the last few months have
      been good to gamers, at least according to my tastes. half-life, thief, baldur's gate
      &amp; the s.m.a.c demo have all been good enough to give me a stiffy. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">but of course i must have more...
      something new. so now, looking to the far horizon of the coming year, there are several
      games that have me getting really excited. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">system shock 2--they just
      released a series of new shots that i think look awesome. i can just *feel* the game-play
      radiating off of these images. every location seems to tell some story or imply some
      interesting interaction-possibility. friends at looking glass &amp; irrational games say
      that shock2 is really shaping up. some members of the thief team have moved over to work
      with the shock2 team (i believe). both groups are made up of some of the people who were
      responsible for underworld, system shock, terra nova and thief. if that doesn't get you
      wildly excited, you probably should not be viewing the content on this page. go <a
      href="http://www.systemshock2.com/" target="_new">here</a> for the new shock2 shots.
      (also, saam runs a really excellent site called Through the Looking Glass. it's another
      great place to get info on LG games.) <a href="http://www.ttlg.com/" target="_new">TTLG.com</a>
      </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">anachronox--yes, i know i work
      for ION, but i work at ION *Austin*, so i rarely get out to the dallas location, the
      mighty tower that it is. (here with warren's group, we work in a little bank strip
      plaza... from which we have nearly been evicted several times for reasons i'd rather not
      divulge.) anyway, i just went to the ION web site and looked over all the new screen shots
      for the game. so far, from the demos i have seen, the game itself seems like a really
      interesting blend of strategy and role-playing. so i was already hyped for the game. but
      now, after seeing the latest work they have done, i am floored. it just looks
      amazing--revolutionary is the word that comes to mind. like jack nicholson said in _as
      good as it gets_, &quot;you make me want to be a better designer...&quot; really. looking
      at those shots is like a kick in the ass--those guys rock. &amp; they are going to raise
      the bar. so this game is another title i am eagerly awaiting. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">diablo 2--baldur's gate is cool
      &amp; it consumed a lot of the last few weekends. but as far as stat based/character
      advancement/kill monsters/collect treasure/ gain levels games go, diablo is the best.
      (btw--as you probably know, i am personally more inclined to the other side of the RPG--
      plot, character, setting; this is more what Deus Ex is all about. so don't be thinking our
      game is going to be some sort of hack &amp; slash fest.) the new diablo 2 shots seem to
      show that blizzard has repeated much of the same goodness that made diablo so damned
      addictive. plus they've added a bunch more. something like 6 character types, new
      monsters, spells, etc. and the ease of their multiplayer access is nothing short of 'the
      best in the world.' i can't wait to play D2--it's all the stat based game-play of a game
      like baldur's gate, plus it's faster, leaner and with fewer annoyances. note to blizzard:
      you should avoid areas that force instant repeated reloads, features that take control of
      the player's character away &amp; NPC interactions that suck everyone in the adventuring

    <small>Ok let's take a little Altered Quiz here shall we? At the moment Sacrates could
    doing any one of these 3 things that is keeping him away from doing updates:</small><br>
    <small>1. He is secretly growing the largest Marijuana Plant in the northern Hemisphere
    and selling it to children on the street for inflated prices.</small><br>
    <small>2. He is in hiding listening to the Bee Gee's and practicing his 70's style dancing
    techniques in preperation for the return of Disco.</small><br>
    <small>3. He is playing so much Everquest that he keeps forgetting to update the page. </small><br>
    <small>With that said, I will let your<font color="#FFFFFF"><strong> Sherlock Holmes

    little Shrimps, I shall return right after Lunch to slap up some goods. Hey, an EQ addict

            for me to do? Kick in some Baldur's Gate damnit! Everquest is incredibly addicting yes,
            Tribes also has that same quality. BG does the same in all respects. All I know is that
            these 3 games alone will keep my gaming needs filled to the brim for some time to come.
