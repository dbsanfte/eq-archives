    <small>About time someone started posting again on the Baldur's Gate boards. Here are<font color="#FFFFFF"><strong> a few tasty posts to keep you guys hyped </strong></font>who
    haven't gotten the game yet, and also for those that do have it. First one is on Killing
    important NPC's and what will happen in an Expansion.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <b><i><p></i></b><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">If a character is
      killable in BG (as far as I know, all are) they will NOT be able to play a critical role
      in the expansion unless we have all options considered. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">(For example, if someone kills
      Thalantyr, but we have built into the expansion that he gets ressed or something and
      becomes a mortal enemy of yours - it would be easy enough to work out) </font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>Problems from Game to Expansion. The big word on killing Drizzt is
    &quot;IF&quot;.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Let's try this again... </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">If you kill Drizzt, he MAY not be
      in your expansion game. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Not saying he WILL be, of course,
      but we are working to tie the expansion game VERY closely with what happens in the
      original game. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">If some of your NPC's die in
      Baldur's Gate, don't expect to see them suddenly alive and happy in Tales of the Sword
      Coast... </font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>What's the name of the damn expansion pack and beyond that?</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">It is called &quot;Tales of the
      Sword Coast&quot; </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">We are still working out the
      details for additional BG products. There appears to be interest in an additional
      expansion, but we don't know if this is going to happen or not. Nothing has been
      decided...</font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>Here's a bit on Paladins.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Couple of things... </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">We were not able to implement
      paladins EXACTLY the way they are in the handbook, so we made allowances. First of all,
      both Protection from Evil and Detect Evil skills that paladins have in BG are MUCH more
      powerful than either of these skills in the player's handbook - in BG this is balanced by
      their not being able to use them constantly (though their abilities increase with levels).
      </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">To offset this, as well as a few
      other things (the lack of a warhorse, for example), we gave paladins the ability to
      specialize in weapons (we're talking about a bonus to hit and damage, as well as an extra
      half attack per round). </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Paladins are NOT a weak class in
      BG. At higher levels, I think paladins are stronger in BG than in the handbook...</font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>How is the game selling and when do we get more?</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">All should have it by this
      weekend...assuming that we don't sell out again ;) </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">We are shipping more product this
      week, now that everyone is back from Christmas and our production and shipping facilities
      are back in full swing. </font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>How close to the rule book are they?</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">However, I would assume YES
      unless came up with a REALLY good reason to change these (which Wizards of the Coast would
      have to approve). Note were are trying to do the best job of bringing AD&amp;D to the
      computer world, NOT reinventing AD&amp;D (or coming out with 3rd edition rules or
      something). If it is in the rules, assume it will be in the expansions unless told
      otherwise. </font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>Finally a bit on Ranger penalties.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">There is a &quot;too hit&quot;
      penalty added for every creature between you and your target. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">There is no point blank bonus but
      this is a melee range penalty. You try shooting someone with a bow when they are close
      enough to grab it. </font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left"><a name="EQ and Spawn camping"><font color="#C1C1FF" face="Arial"><strong>EQ
    and Spawn camping</strong></font></a> <a href="mailto:sacrates@voodooextreme.com"><small>-
    Sacrates</small></a><br>
    <small>I was getting a bit fiesty today wondering what and if anything were being done on
    a problem I am greatly worried about. So<font color="#FFFFFF"><strong> I took my EQ lovin
    Chimply ass over to the boards</strong></font> and slapped up a message to the guides.
    Without further ado mine first and Thorim's in Bold.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"><small>I have quite a few
      friends currently in Beta 3 at the moment (I am not) and all of them are ecstatic about
      EQ. However, many of them have been griping about one thing particularly. Camping at Spawn
      locations. This could get quite ugly if nothing is done about it. Already I am hearing
      many arguments and players screaming at each other on this matter. &quot;That was my
      creature&quot; or &quot;this is my spawn&quot;. <br>
      I hear the spawns are at pre-set locations in the world? Once B4 starts or the consumer
      version is released do you have plans on randomizing spawn locations? I hear some sections
      of the game have been camped barren from players sitting on Spawn locations. This, to me,
      is possibly the most alarming thing I have heard yet about the game.</small></font></p>
      <p><strong><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Some fixed spawns have
      this 'camping' problem, and various solutions are being discussed. </font></small></strong></p>
      <p><strong><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">I have confidence that
      this will be solved before final, but it is a concern at the moment, yes. </font></small></strong></p>
      <p><strong><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Be assured that it is a
      known issue, 989 has been very good about listening to us (the testers) and coming up with

    <blockquote>
      <font color="#e3cead"><p></font><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">This
      is our preliminary troubleshooting guide for users who may be experiencing random crashes.
      We are doing our best to try and compile everything into one document. As additional
      information is gathered, including specific information relating to specific hardware, it
      will be added.<br>
      <br>
      Random Crashes/Problems<br>
      <br>
      1. Verify that you have DirectX6.0 installed. The newest version of Microsofts DirectX can
      always be found at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/directx/" target="_top">www.microsoft.com/directx</a>.
      DirectX 6.0 was also included on the Baldurs Gate CD-ROM.<br>
      <br>
      2. Verify that all of your current drivers are DirectX certified. Information on this can
      be found at <a href="http://www.interplay.com/support/directx/" target="_top">www.interplay.com/support/directx/</a><br>
      <br>
      3. If applicable, compare the driver version you are using with another users posted and
      working driver information. This is available at <a href="http://www.interplay.com/support/bgate/hardware.html" target="_top">www.interplay.com/support/bgate/hardware.html</a>.
      These are driver sets sent in by customers experiencing no problems. If yours does not
      match, contact your manufacturer for the specific version. <br>
      <br>
      4. Shutdown all programs running in the background. To verify you have no remaining TSRs,
      use &#145;CTRL-ALT-DELETE&#146; to bring up your task manager. Disable or shutdown any
      utility programs that might be causing a conflict. <br>
      <br>
      5. From the readme.txt file - Some video cards may experience graphics glitches while
      playing the game. These problems are caused by DirectX Hardware Calls to your video card
      that are not functioning. You can enable a software render for these calls if you have the
      most recent drivers for your video card and are still experiencing them. Using the
      software render will fix the graphic glitches, but will result in a performance hit. IF
      YOU ARE EXPERIENCING PROBLEMS WITH THE GRAPHICAL DISPLAY OF BALDUR'S GATE, PLEASE MAKE
      SURE YOU HAVE THE LATEST VERSION OF YOUR VIDEO DRIVERS. DRIVER UPDATES ARE AVAILABLE AT
      MOST (if not all) HARDWARE MANUFACTURERS AND CHIPSET MANUFACTURERS SITES ON THE INTERNET.
      If you have the most recent drivers for your video card, and you are still experiencing
      problems, you can enable software renders for these calls. The options are available in
      the options menu under 'Graphics'. The following list describes the known graphics
      glitches and which call should be disabled to fix them.<br>
      <br>
      Green boxes surrounding options &#150;Disable Software Transparent BLT<br>
      Animations appearing reversed &#150; Disable Software Mirror BLT<br>
      Glitches with the Fog-of-War &#150; Disable Software Mirror BLT<br>
      Vertical Lines down the main game screen &#150; Software Standard BLT<br>
      Mouse trailer is leaving graphic problems &#150; Software Standard BLT<br>
      <br>
      6. Try disabling or enabling Direct3D or DirectDraw. These options are available by
      running DXTOOL. (Start/Find/Files or Folders/DXTOOL.EXE)<br>
      <br>
      7. Try disabling EAX or Environmental Audio Sound. This option is available on the Sound
      screen of the games main &#145;Option&#146; Selection.<br>
      <br>
      8. Verify that your in-game resolution matches your system resolution. (i.e., 16bit for
      both.)<br>
      <br>
      9. Verify that you have enough available hard drive space. The games cache requires a
      minimum of 80 meg available. Please take into account that the windows swap file will also
      require its own space.<br>
      <br>
      This information will also be placed in the troubleshooting section of the Baldurs Gate

    <small>Right after I said I wouldn't post a few thousand Reviews of the same title I go
    and post this Review. <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Don't start jumping on good ole
    Sacrates like the Skipper and a full course meal</strong></font> <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Yet</strong></font>.
    OGR has a tendency to write up some good Reviews and this is another good example to that
    rule. With that said, they do the deed to <a href="http://www.ogr.com/reviews/returnkrondor_1.phtm">Raymond E Fiest's Return to Krondor
    </a>and come to the same conclusions we did in our own Review....it's pretty tasty
    although somewhat short. </small></p>
    <font color="#ffffff" face="Arial" size="2"><blockquote>
      <p></font><font size="2" color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Does Return to Krondor
      live up to the grand expectations? You bet your enchanted broadsword it does. It isn't
      perfect, but it's very engaging; if you didn't know about the rocky development road this
      game has taken, you'd never guess from the final product. Raymond E. Feist's world of
      Midkemia is back, along with the dashing Squire James, plenty of open-ended exploration,
      and strong narrative structures worthy of a novel. There are also some new twists, most
      noticeably the excellent 3D graphics (card supported but not required) and a clever
      trap-disabling system used for accessing chests. The real star of a good Krondor game,
      however, is the story, and this edition serves up plenty of it, piping-hot.</font></p>

    <small>Since it seems most of these Reviews tend to start sounding the same each time, I'm
    going to stop posting 20 different Reviews of the same title over and over and....you get
    the point. I will try to post someone who has a fairly different take on the idea but
    generally will only post a few links to Reviews. Who wants to read Fallout 2 Review number
    2,451? I would rather have an Ogrillion in Baldur's Gate <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>grab
    my testicles and go for an afternoon run</strong></font> than read another one of those. </small></p>

    <small>Ah just another Quest for Glory Review coming your way. It seems everyone has the
    same opinion of it that I have seen. Gamespot has done the<a href="http://www.gamespot.com/rpg/questfor/"> Reviewing</a> in this case and have come to <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>the same conclusion as the rest</strong></font>. Blah. Here's a
    biscuit for ya.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">I really enjoyed my
      first ten hours of Quest for Glory V, but as the game wore on, I became more frustrated by
      the pace of the game and the pixel-hunting instances of gameplay. A better interface, a
      quest log that showed you what you had to do, and better handling of combat would have
      alleviated some of my concerns. I did finish the game, and I enjoyed it overall, but the
      ending was definitely disappointing. As the final farewell to Hero, this game should have
      at least included an epilogue of some sort that let you know what happened to Hero and all
      his companions. Quest for Glory V has a few quirks and problems that will try your
      patience, but series fans will want to play this game to see old friends and follow Hero's
      last adventure.</font></small></p>

    <small>Thorim made a brief visit to the boards again and had a bit to say about Pets in EQ

    <small>So is Baldur's Gate the greatest Computer Role Playing Game ever made? <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Yer darn tootin it is</strong></font>. Is it everything we hoped
    it would be? Yup! Now everything else beyond this point is going to be compared to this
    game. It's an instant classic. Anyway, after that rant let's let Ray show you a post he
    just smacked up on the boards regarding the tech support address.</small></p>

      <font color="#e3cead"><p></font><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Hi
      Ray,<br>
      <br>
      This is Matt Byrne, I manage the tech supp/cust serv department over at Interplay. I just
      wanted to drop you a note regarding the posting of customers system specs that have the
      game working correctly. If you would like, I'd be happy to have our department handle the
      collection and recording of these specs. (Naturally it will help us out greatly when we
      receive calls on Baldurs.) We could post the list maybe bi-weekly, or have a page designed
      that had a continual updated list of working hardware and their corresponding driver
      versions on it, that both my techs and our customers could reference. If we do decide to
      move forward with this, the message posted by 'Alptraum' would be the ideal template or
      example for others to follow. There is not a whole lot that he left out on that. <br>
      <br>
      If you post that any customer who sends an email to '<a href="http://www.bgchronicles.com/support@interplay.com">support@interplay.com</a>', with
      the subject line 'WORKING SYSTEM SPECS', I'll have a rule setup first thing Monday morning
      that filters those letters immediately to a folder where they can be sorted through. I'm
      working from home so my posts do not show up highlighted... I think it would get a lot
      more response if the idea stood out, and was posted by you. </font></small></p>

    <small>Alright not much out there in the RPG fruit basket. Yesterday was pretty impressive
    for this time of the year considering I thought everyone would be playing BG and Tribes
    all day. I'll be back at Noon to kick the news in the Bill Clinton and see if I can dig
    some up. BTW, everyone wish Bowmeister a great vacation. He's heading off to<font color="#FFFFFF"><strong> the land of nuts and honey</strong></font>, of Pimps and Ho's, of
    Richard Simmons and Gary Coleman's. (i.e. same thing as Pimps and Ho's) He'll be here in
    the States for about a month in sunny California so don't expect him to update for a
    little while. So yer stuck with me....bend over and take it like a man. (Or more
