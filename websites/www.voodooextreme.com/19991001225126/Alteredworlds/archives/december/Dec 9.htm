      <i><p></i><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">At this stage in
      development, it would NOT be easy to add full WaveTracing support to *this* game.
      (Consider editor changes, in-game changes, database changes, potential modeller
      plugins/exporters to facilitate surface tagging, etc.). Simply passing a set of geometry
      to the Vortex2 processor is probably indeed simple, but that alone does not give you full
      immersion. Geometry itself isn't enough; surface properties must also be taken into
      account, and I see that as the bigger hurdle. (There are obviously other issues, such as
      how our world geometry is divided / organized / loaded, and how that affects downloading
      to the audio processor, which affects framerate, etc., etc.) </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The decision to implement EAX was
      made before the A3D 2.0 SDK was out of beta, and our production schedule reflects this.
      EAX may not provide as mathematically &quot;correct&quot; a representation as WaveTracing,
      but it can be tailored to give good effects (we'll have to wait and see how EAX 2.0 does
      things). If we have time to revisit the issue before we ship, who knows, maybe we'll put
      support in. </font></small></p>

    <small>Stephen Nichols was on the Middle Earth message boards and talked a bit about
    having Mule characters and how many <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>characters per server </strong></font>you'll
    be able to get. Scope this out.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">We will support four
      characters per account in Middle-earth. This means that you can have four characters per
      server. We will most probably place some kind of restrictions about switching between
      characters on the same server. We won't be able to eliminate it, but we can put some kind
      of time restriction on it. I'm currently thinking that we should limit how quickly you can
      go back to a character you have already played within a certain time frame. Simply
      allowing one character per server is a bit overkill. There are too many families that like
      to play these games together. While together does not mean simultaneously in this
      instance, it is still an important concept. Having three brothers who play at separate
      times but are working toward the same goals is a good thing. We definately need to keep an
      eye on people who like to abuse the multiple characters, but we also need to cater to
      families that like to play &quot;together&quot;. </font></small></p>

      are definitely looking forward to BG2. We'll be tightening up the basic classes and fixing
      the odd thing here and there. There may be a few additions to the class choices, but the
      basics will still come first. I really want to push for more class-based plots that evolve
      the player character. Things like acquiring followers, attaining status and property, and
      generally doing something for each class, based on the changes AD&amp;D characters undergo
      around 10th level and up. They really need a separate game to get the proper treatment.
      Freaky-powerful creatures will be great too. It is called &quot;Dungeons and DRAGONS&quot;
      after all, and when we do them, we'll do them right. There are things creepier than the
      big ol' lizards too, but we'll keep them for a surprise. </font></small></p>

    <small>Alright now that the Pussy, er...Cat is out of the Bag on the release date, we're
    getting a <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>few extra goodies coming</strong></font> our way
    from the message boards etc. First one is Don talking about the Release Date.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Ok, we know all of you are
      anxious and chomping at the bit for BG to be released. Believe me we understand this as we
      are all game players. We have worked on this game for a long time now and want it out just
      as much as the rest of you. If we had believed this game would not come out this fall, I
      think the decision would have been been made to officially push the release date to next
      year. It's not anyone's intention to string along the public. We are real close to
      shipping, for the last six months we have felt close. As more time passes the closer you
      feel. Even I feel this way, and I am known as one of the pessimistic people in the office.
      When asked what how long something is going to take my estimats are usually double
      everyone elses. Unfortunatly, it's real hard to get a bead on development time ,
      especially when it involves fixing bugs. With the regular development cycle at least you
      know roughly where you are by how much is not done. But when bug testing, the amount of
      new bugs increases for a while over time as more are found. It's real hard to magically
      pull a date out of a hat when you don't know the future. If I was in charge of choosing
      and posting a release date and I had said October, then November 15, then December 1,
      etc., a lot more harm would be done then good. Just think how many upset posts we have
      seen about the changes in release dates the game has already had. Please bear with us just
      a little longer, we really do appreciate your support, in fact some us are floored. This
      is the first game I have worked on and I am still not used to it. We do notice the
      messages posted whether negative or positive, even though we don't have time to reply to
      them all. Yes, this message I am posting may be 'same old, same old' but the only real
      news I think any of us want to give you is that the game has went Gold. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">We don't want to release the game
      with known bugs but its also naive to think that the game will ship without any unknown
      bugs. So, of course, if we have to we are prepared to patch the game. We sure hope we can
      prevent that though. I understand what you mean by overkill though, but what is overkill
      and what is not is very subjective. But we are not releasing a mission critical piece of
      software here. If we were, we would be doing another 2 years of testing. It's real hard,
      on one hand you hear people that wish the game was released in beta form and others that
      complain if they find one minor bug.</font></small></p>

    <p><small>Then a bit on a few people not liking the chat. WTF? Hell, people they had a
    F'ing chat for gods sake! It never ceases to amaze me how incredibly immature the gaming
    community can be sometimes.</small></p>

      really shouldn't be posting to this as I don't want to be involved a flame war. I wasn't
      able to join the chat, but I am surprised that people think it was a joke and just a media
      event put on by people who don't care. Those involved from Bioware and Interplay were
      taking time out of their busy schedules to try to help answer your questions. No one ever
      said the chat was about the release date, it was a last opportunity for people to ask
      questions to the developers. If the game had been sent to the manufacturer tonight, we
      would have told you so, anything else is just speculation. We are trying to develop the
      game that you want to play and we would want to play. Yes, there are actually software
      companies in the world that care about their products. Most developers don't have an
      active presence on the internet because it is too time consuming and when it leads to
      flaming and unconstructive feedback it becomes counterproductive. They end up wasting
      their time defending themselves and not doing their jobs and getting the products you want
      done. This is why I am submitting only one post on this issue. I probably shouldn't post
      at all because someone will take it the wrong way and hate me for it. Clamming up would be
      the easy and safe thing to do. I am just hoping that some of you who feel burnt will have
      a change of heart. </font></small></p>

    <small>Not exactly enlightening news for those waiting to get on Phase 4 of the beta. I
    suspect they won't start it until around Early January with the March release date
    sounding very possible now. This is only a guess from my part, but when have my guesses
    been wrong? If i'm wrong on this one i'll gladly make all updates standing on my head for
    an entire day<font color="#FFFFFF"><strong> Without the help of an Intern</strong></font>!</small></p>

      conducting the third phase of beta testing for about a month now. So far everything is
      running smoothly and on-track. However, we have not decided whether or not phase 4 will be
      beginning before or after Christmas. The programming team has been working diligently, and
      we would like to have phase 3 as bug-free as possible before phase 4 begins. Our goal is
      to please our testers, and ultimately the consumers after the game is released. We
      appriciate everyone's enthusiasm for EverQuest, and will keep you informed on the starting
      date for Phase 4 testing.</font></small></p>
