    Let's just say it's ready to go at an instants notice and you should see it first thing
    tomorrow. (Eastern time for you Gomers out there) Believe me when I say it's worth the

    way. Plus refresh the page a few times to check out all the new Altered Banners we have

      ...lord of new technology that never works and forces all followers to tithe repeatably
      for other dietys patented sermons that were stolen.<br>
      <br>
      9) Dog -The backwards god<br>
      <br>
      8) Gaz'n Hyte - Followers of Gaz'n Hyte, King of Sneeze, believe allergic reactions to be
      blessings from their deity. They are almost always seen scratching, itching, sneezing or
      blowing their runny nose throughout the lands of Norrath, and are renowned for their
      pinkish-red skin tone compared to those normally of their race. Herbal and medicinal
      remedies for these allergies are seen as sacrilegious towards their deity, and they would
      fight (and preferably scratch) to defend this sacred belief to their last asthmatically
      challenged breath. Followers of Gaz'n Hyte tend to be of the less intellectually advanced
      races, for obvious reasons.<br>
      <br>
      7) Java, the Deity of all forms af caffeine. All shall pay homage to this God during the
      long EQ (Expresso Quaffing) nights of fights, friends and adventure! <br>
      <br>
      6) The Great White Porcelain God, this is the god of drinking and wine.<br>
      <br>
      5) Rhedneqh - Followers of Rhedneqh can often be found in taverns or in their lairs with a
      beer balanced on their bloated bellies. Their mating call sounds similar to a belch, only
      it is much louder. They should not be enraged as they can attack with hideous clouds of
      poisonous gas. It is not know if this is a magical spell or some sort of innate ability.
      The followers of Rhedneqh have made one notable contribution to society - the &quot;Bow
      rack.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      4) The Abominable god MaXsLaYa D00dKiLlA. Monks, paladins, and clerics who pray to this
      powerful being gain insight into the all powerful skill known as 'bug exploitation' and
      the super ability known as 'powergaming' to help further the d0Od struggle throughout
      Norrath.<br>
      <br>
      3) I am thou's Roleplaying God, thou shalt use correcteth grammereth in my world or thou
      shall be bannished to the burning fires of hell. 'U's will resulteth in circumcisementeth
      and 'kewl' with resulteth in spanketh on thou's hideth. Roleplay or DiE!<br>
      <br>
      2) The Rusted Armor Deity, Ferrous Oxygenatis, because if you DON'T sink while swimming,
      your enchanted armor will surely turn as orangey-brown as that which comes out of a
      troll's... Well, just pray that it doesn't : )<br>
      <br>
      1) Insomnolence - Patron of Sleeplessness - Worshippers of Insomnolence tend to be a
      rather pale lot. His purview are those who forego sleep in favor of rather dubious
      pursuits. Town criers, heralds, any regular source of information draw these Insomniites
      like flies. Y'see, the diety encourages his faithful in the pursuit of knowledge...to the
      exclusion of all else. Knowledge is a fine thing, I suppose but these berks take it a bit
      too far. They'll scavenge for morsels of information, browsing amongst the sages and
      criers of Norrath whenever they can. When something new comes along, they'll flock to the
      newscarrier. Mostly night-goers, the sleepless will stay awake as long as possible,
      pausing only for brief, barely adequate meals or to catch a few short hours of sleep. You
      can easily identify them by their tremendously bloodshot eyes.</small></font></p>

      WITH SIERRA STUDIOS </p>
      <p>Sierra Studios Announces Publishing Deal with Troika Games<br>
      Tim Cain's New Role-Playing Game to be Published in Exclusive Game Agreement</b> </p>
      <p>BELLEVUE, WA - October 29, 1998 - Sierra Studios announced today a publishing deal with
      Fallout creator Tim Cain's new game company, Troika Games LLC. The first yet to be named
      title is scheduled for release in the third quarter of the year 2000 and is a role-playing
      game from the core team who brought the gaming world the award-winning RPG Fallout,
      published by Interplay in 1997. This marks the first game from this stellar team as a
      company and solidifies the re-branding of Sierra Studios and its commitment to publishing
      high quality games for the millennium. </p>
      <p>&quot;Tim Cain, Leonard Boyarsky and Jason Anderson made a name for themselves with
      their work on Fallout last year,&quot; said Scott Lynch, senior vice president of Sierra
      Studios. &quot;Their team has a combined 20 years in the games business and we're excited
      to be working with them on their next project. We are confident Troika Games will produce
      another award-winning game and bring RPGs a new brand of quality in the genre.&quot; </p>
      <p>&quot;Over the course of six months I looked at a lot of different publishers, I went
      with Sierra Studios for one reason - trust. I trust them and their experience at handling
      big ticket games,&quot; said Tim Cain. &quot;This is the RPG I've been waiting 15 years to
      make - it's got everything I want in an RPG a cool story, a large variety of characters
      you can create, lots of paths through the game, great artwork and an awesome engine that
      really supports the plot.&quot; </p>
      <p>Troika Games LLC was founded in April 1998 by Timothy Cain, Leonard Boyarsky, and Jason
      Anderson, the creators of Fallout - the 1997 winner of OGR's Game of the Year, and winner
      of RPG of the Year from PC Gamer, Computer Gaming World, GameSpot, Adrenaline Vault, Games
      Domain, Gamesmania among others. The goal of Troika Games is to develop the
      highest-quality games available for the home computer. Troika Games is currently
      developing a new RPG for Sierra Studios due for release in the summer of the year 2000.</font></small></p>

    wonderful world of 3D.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">What people first
      need to understand is that from day one &#150; even prior to the Ultima series &#150;
      since back in 1974 when I was in high school making simple paper-tape games that I'd just
      call &quot;D&amp;D 1&quot;, &quot;D&amp;D 2&quot;, etc., every one of the games that I've
      written has had the same goal: to create a completely believable, virtual world and a
      compelling reason to be there. I think every game I've done through the years has gotten
      me closer to that goal, in the sense that characters have gotten more realistic, world
      physics has gotten more realistic, graphic detail has become more realistic. I also think
      I've done a pretty good job at making the worlds compelling places to be, since they've
      had epic stories that made the gamer the hero and given that hero a reason and purpose.
      It's still my dream, my goal, to create a completely believable, realistic world.</p>
      <p>Now the viewpoint is a very important part of achieving that goal. Ideally my games
      would literally take gamers to that realistic world, where they wouldn't see, or hear, or
      feel, or smell, or touch the difference from reality. Of course that's a pipe dream that's
      decades off, but people shouldn't be so concerned when they see that we've gone from 2D
      graphics to 3D graphics. Earlier Ultimas had both 2D and 3D portions in them...</font></small></p>

      be able to give a full feature list, but we're not quite ready for that yet, because
      things are still in development and we wouldn't want to announce a feature and then not
      deliver it to you. </font></font></p>
      <p><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">What I can say (I hope!) is that we are
      developing a brand new engine that is specifically tuned for both hardware acceleration
      and an RPG 3rd person perspective. One of the biggest trade-offs made on Jedi was to done
      to support a wider range of hardware than Quake2 (which also came out after Jedi Knight).
      With this engine, we are focusing on hardware accelerators which gives us a lot more
      freedom when choosing features. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Our primary focus with this engine is
      creating a highly moody and realistic environment, so we are spending the most time
      working on features involving lighting, shadows, fog, etc. We also have some really
      incredible 3D artists working on models, so we've spent a lot of time in the engine
      creating a character rendering system that does them justice. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">We can't say for certain what will be
      out on the shelves at the time we ship this game, but our feeling is that this engine will
      go toe-to-toe with the feature sets of other engines at that time, and hopefully exceed
      them in the areas we're focusing on.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Sorry for being vague, but when we have

      drivers will make their EAX implementation better than CL's...). Also keep in mind that

      to do a Hall of Worlds or Kelewan sequal for a variety of reasons I do no wish to discuss
      now. Except for this: we haven't begun to dig into Midkemia yet, and if I ever do
      something in the Hall of Worlds, it will be way down the line. And Kelewan wouldn't work

      the city, and many, many buildings. </small><br>

      : P.S. - Ray, after I played BaK I proceeded to pick up every Feist book I could and have
