    <small>Now here is an interesting question that our Ho boy Stephen Nichols jumped on.
    Pretty much says <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>who's got the bigger</strong></font>..uh...World.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Origin touts UO's map to be
      &quot;nearly 200 million square feet of stunning 3-D terrain&quot;. Now, assuming that
      those &quot;square feet&quot; are in game-space, we can do a little math. If the map is
      sqare in shape then it must be 14,142 feet across. That would put it at 2.6 miles across.
      Now, if you had a walker or a cane it might take you 7 hours to cross that distance.
      Otherwise, I'd put it at an hour on foot.</font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Our map is 20,000 surface rooms
      (not counting the HUGE underground areas, like Moria) each one of those rooms is 3200
      pixels square. Our male human character is 140 pixels tall and stands about 6 feet in game
      space. That puts the number of game-space feet to cross a room at 139. That means that
      each room is 19,321 square feet. Take that and multiply it by 20,000 and you get
      386,420,000 in surface area alone (I'm estimating another 100,000,000 square feet in
      subterranean areas). Using that math, you can determine that you would come across another
      player every 38,642 feet of travel which is about 1 other player for every 1.75 rooms you
      cross. That, of course, assumes perfect distribution. There will be areas of
      concentration, but without teleportation it will be extremely difficult for very large
      concentrations to exist. This also assumes that 10,000 people are online. I would imagine
      that 30 percent of the population would be underground, so that further relieves the
      potential crowding problem. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">It will take you a little over an
      hour on foot to cross our map if you could go in a straight line and were not interrupted
      (which is not likely). Having a horse will help. I think this is large enough for a game.
      Certainly, the real Middle-earth was much larger but there has to be a balance between
      size and playability. Not to mention that it would take MANY CDs to hold a map that was
      the &quot;correct&quot; scale.</font></small></p>

    over on the Backroom message boards. First off is a big post on strategies for the makeup
    of characters within your party...</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Thought I'd
      jump-start some new discussion here cuz everyone is starting to get fried listening to
      un-ending release date and beta testing posts.<br>
      <br>
      I have been reading a LOT of posts about the 'ultimate' character class combination.
      Having played both AD&amp;D and BG I think people need to shift their gears a little.
      AD&amp;D is all about PARTY based adventuring. It is the same with BG. Instead of focusing
      on the ultimate single character, people should be thinking about the ultimate party --
      and then start recruiting players to fill those roles. Put differently, in UO everyone
      talks about 'tank mages' as being the most powerful character to play. In BG I think
      people are taking the tank mage thing and are applying it to a Fighter/Mage and thinking
      that that is the all around best combination (good melee power, good strategic spell use).
      However, a party of 4 fighters &amp; 2 mages will ALWAYS (IMHO) be able to to take out 6
      fighter/mages of the same experience point level...<br>
      <br>
      For example, assuming all characters have 65,000 xp, you would have four 7th level
      fighters (with their extra attacks) and two 7th level mages (with 4th level spells)
      against 6 6th/5th level Fighter/Mages (with standard attacks and 3rd level spells). If
      those 7th level fighters are dwarves (with high constitution and innate magic resistance)
      the balance can become even be more skewed.<br>
      <br>
      Granted, there are exceptions to every rule and you could always get lucky... in the above
      example you could always come upon the party of 7th level characters, surprise them, and
      IF they were in a small area, and IF none of your characters were wearing armor you could
      fire off 6 fireballs and probably take out most of them... (average damage 6 level 6
      Fireballs = 126, half if save)... but over the long haul, I'm not sure you'd be better
      off...<br>
      <br>
      So here's the question... (and this will be interesting to see AFTER people have played BG
      as well). What is the ALL-AROUND best party for what people foresee as being the skills
      necessary to be successful in BG? (Oh and watch class/race/alignment constraints - none of
      this Paladins cruising around with Druids stuff... might be ok for a short time, but
      Paladins and Druids would each find the experience 'unpalatable' after a while...) </font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>He then looks at Racial class limitations...</p>
    </small><blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The only race that
      comes close to having a level limit in BG would be halfling clerics, who would normally be
      capped at level 8. With the experience point cap of 89,000 this will not be an issue
      (since you can only reach level 7 as a single-classed cleric).<br>
      <br>
      We have NOT decided how we are going to handle this in expansions.</font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>Then a look a the new beta testing going on at Black Isle Studios...</p>
    </small><blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">First, Black Isle is
      doing the testing... Bioware is just getting our input.<br>
      <br>
      Second, this additional testing is going to SPEED UP our ability to release the game. We
      are NOT holding the game for more testing, we are adding testers to get through the
      necessary testing faster.<br>
      <br>
      Third, I just like posting all my notes in threes (good luck you know) ;)</font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>And finally a look at the Paladin's detect evil ability...</p>
    </small><blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">It will not run
      'automatically'.<br>
      <br>
      For purposes of game play, we assume that the Paladin in question has to stop and
      'concentrate' on whether he can detect evil in the area. He accesses the detect evil
      ability through his 'special abilities' icon - in many ways it is as if he stopped to cast
      a spell. We did not treat the spell EXACTLY like it is treated in AD&amp;D... instead of
      detecting evil acts (or evil intent) it will detect an overall inclination towards evil.
      Monsters will clearly emanate evil... characters with evil alignments will also emanate
      evil. Note that just because characters emanate evil does NOT mean that they are currently
      up to an evil act. Paladins would know just to be 'wary' of these characters - i.e. to
      keep an eye on them. Also, if a creature is emanating evil out of the line of site of the
      Paladin, the Paladin will detect the evil, but will not have a sense of where it is coming
      from (directionally).<br>
      <br>
      Finally, one last comment. If an evil character joins your party, you can automatically
      access his/her alignment (on the character information page) and KNOW that they are evil.
      However, any evil behaviors/tendencies will be buried in the scripts that control the
      character's behavior. They may be total law-abiding citizens while with your party (i.e.
      keeping a low profile), or they may not...</font></small></p>

      engine is similar in many ways to its predecessor, Sierra's long-standing gaming system
      SCI. Their similarities give Dragon Fire the classic Sierra adventure game look. Both
      systems combine animated characters with detailed graphics backgrounds, but Dragon Fire
      has surpassed SCI in its use of 16-bit graphics and the integration of real-time 3D art
      and animation.&quot; </font></small></p>

      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">For the new
      Ascension site, we're planning a whole heck of a lot more content. A bestiary is among the
      plans. What's nice about that, is that it allows people who are interested in those kinds
      of things a chance to view them prior to purchasing the game.. but if you are the type who
      likes to discover them for yourself, then you still get to. You just avoid those web
      pages. (If you are strong willed anyway. :)<br>
      <br>
      Hope that helps... start looking for the new site in a couple of months. (I think. :)</font></small></p>

    </small><blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">BG uses
      EnumDisplayModes to determine which colour depths are available. Some 2MB cards don't have

      grayed out on the options page if they are not available.</font></small></p>

    <p><small>And finally a bit from Dr. Ray again, this time looking at just why they are
    having a public beta when the game should be out right away...</p>
    </small><blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"><small>We are quite close,
      so don't worry. It's just that we want to get a fresh view of the game - from the consumer
      perspective - of the almost-completed product, BEFORE we put it in a box, so that we can
      try and correct any remaining problems that we can't see anymore. We are being obsessive
      about trying to find the bugs in the game, and this limited beta test (more like a focus
      group really, except that we're also getting bugs from them), in trying to intensively
      identify any major things that have been overlooked because we've gotten too close to the
      game in the past few months of bug fixing and testing. Plus to test the hell out of the
      completed multiplayer code to make sure that we don't have any unhappy people because they
      can't connect...<br>
      <br>
      I don't anticipate that this additional testing will in any way delay the release of the
      product - it will be concurrent with the last week or two of testing. It's a great idea
      and we look forward to hearing the testers' frank comments, all in the name of improving
      the game.</small></font></p>

    <blockquote>

      problems with the car late yesterday afternoon that needed to be fixed. So we had to build
      another version of the patch. </p>
      <p>QA is testing the patch right now. Some people here at Interplay/BIS want it released
      as soon as possible, others want to check it as thoroughly as possible. I am leaning
      towards checking it as thouroughly as possible, because I don't want to release a buggy
      patch. </p>
      <p>We are really, really trying to get it out by tomorrow night, so everyone can play over
      the weekend. However, if we find some serious bugs tomorrow then it might not happen. We
      are working on it, and I am as frustrated as everyone else that things keep on coming up
      that need to be fixed. </p>
      <p>Also, in order for me to help get it done I am not going to be able to be at my desk
      that much. This means that I will not be responding to e-mail that quickly over the next
