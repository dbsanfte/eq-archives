    post all day....hmm <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>something wicked this way comes</strong></font>!
    Crunch time. I have a feeling we may be getting an announcement soon on BG. Check back.
    Anyway this was an SS post and let's let Ken say his thing about the Sex of Shodan.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">Shodan is an AI, and
      therefore, doesn't really have a sex. However, I think those of us who played it the first
      time on the CD version think of her as a she. Xemu thinks of it as an it, so even the
      design team has different images of her. However, SHODAN is what SHODAN thinks it needs to
      be at that time and place. SHODAN is what's best for SHODAN, not us insects. </font></small></p>

      be Something Good. 3DFX is determined to remain the leader with this single chip solution
      that is touted to be more powerful than the Voodoo 2 SLI. From what I have been able to
      gather from preliminary benchmarks, this seem to be the case, although we still have quite
      some time for hardware and driver maturation to show increases in speed.<br>
      <br>
      Speed is not the only thing to consider in this chip, however. Some of the things that are
      definitely not something to scoff at are:<br>
      <br>
      Dual 32-bit texture rendering architecture<br>
      True Multi-texturing: two textures per pixel per clock<br>
      Single Pass, Single Cycle Bump mapping<br>
      Single Pass, Single Cycle trilinear mip-mapping<br>
      Per-pixel atmospheric fog with programmable fog-zones<br>

    <blockquote>
      <p><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"><small><b>GameSpot:</b> So how does 3Dfx
      work into your art design? <br>
      </small><b><br>
      <small>Max:</b> The beauty of our particular use of 3Dfx is that it is entirely on the
      programming end. We [the art department] actually did nothing new to have the 3Dfx
      implementation. In other words, we didn't have to redo any artwork. We didn't have to
      format it any differently. [The 3D-enhanced graphics] just works within our given
      construct and [Diablo II] takes advantage of the 3Dfx chips that are there. One of the
      reasons [for this] is that we don't want to get into a situation where we are making a
      game for the 3Dfx at the expense of people who don't have a 3Dfx card. </small></font></p>

    <p align="left"><a name="Elves in ME"><font face="Arial" color="#C1C1FF"><strong>Elves in
    ME</strong></font></a><a href="mailto:sacrates@voodooextreme.com"><small> - Sacrates</small></a><br>
    <small>It's a Monday and<font color="#FFFFFF"><strong> I am getting about as much RPG news
    as I am getting Screenshots or Beta slots from Brad</strong></font>. However I am getting
    a morsel here and there, and just happened to wonder over to the ME boards and noticed
    Janus Anderson posted a bit on Elves in Middle Earth. </small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">We've proposed a few systems to
      deal with overpopulation of elves in ME. According to the statistics we've gathered from
      the registration at our website, around half of the players want to play Elves initially.
      This, of course, is quite contrary to the works of Tolkien. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">One proposed solution is to have
      an initial contest of sorts where people send in a brief essay describing the background
      and history of their Elf in order to secure the ability to play an Elven character. In
      this way, we would start a small seed population of strong RPers who would hopefully play
      in character. After the initial seed population has been selected, they would be given the
      power to make other players 'Elf-friends'. After a player had accrued enough 'Elf-friend'
      tags, he/she would also be able to create Elven characters. We would, of course, limit the
      number of friendships awarded based on time - Elves could maybe only award one player a
      month. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Unfortunately, this system is
      fairly complicated and would contribute to customer support costs. We may just award the
      ability to create an Elf randomly, or use a less complicated system. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">One other possible solution is to
      make the elves advance much slower but have them ultimately become more powerful than the
      other races. Since elves live much longer than the other races, they're not in a rush to
      learn anything quickly since they have forever to do it. In this way, casual players would
      be more likely to play a non-Elf race, and the hardcore players who have lots of time to
      invest would play Elves.</font></small></p>

    Ah well, here's a bunch of goodness from the man himself, Richard Garriott...first, on
    multiplayer in U:A...</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">In the future a
      Multiplayer party adventure would be a cool thing! But in this release of Ultima IX
      ascension, no.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Then he responds to a bunch of questions that have been kicking around...</p>
    </small><blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Wow, some good stuff
      in here! Let see, how can I respond to some of these?...<br>
      <br>
      Most mentioned was the party, I hear the wish, but we cannot meet thy desires. Nor do I
      think it would be the right thing to do at this time. We'll see.<br>
      <br>
      Next most asked seemed to be audio. We do have excellent surround audio. World noises and
      creature sounds are 3D positioned around you and even enclosed spaces echo correctly. Is
      is cool. I'm sure you'll like it.<br>
      <br>
      Their was a question posed about does immersive equal fun. To which I say, no. Immersive
      is a tool to make the experience feel as real as possible. I want to believe it is really
      happening. If you just want to play a game, their are plenty of those out too. Immersive
      does not preclude fun factor, but does present certain challenges. That's our job.<br>
      <br>
      Replay... Boy I hear that one from my bosses every day. But I do not have a great answer.
      We are creating a well crafted experience, we do not have a plan for add ins, downloads,
      mission disks, level editors or post winning levels at this time. After we ship, we'll
      rethink this again, but right now, we just want to finish this solo player masterpiece. We
      think that's enough of a challenge.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>And finally on why there is no option to play a female Avatar...</p>
    </small><blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Let me lay this
      debate to rest. As the perpetrator of said discrimination or strategy, let me tell you
      which it is. Neither! It's purely practicality. I would much rather give the option and
      have the whole game configure itself based on gender preference and even your gender
      preference for a mate. Early on in U9 that's the way we had it. However, once we decided
      that we wanted to have pre-rendered movie segments. Then we had to decide to either never
      show the Avatar, render two of ever scene that had the Avatar, allow only male Avatars or
      even if you were a female in the game, the flics showed males. The never show didn't make
      for the artistic style we wanted, the double render was more than we could afford, so we
      have chosen male only Avatars. The fact that only a few % of Ultima players are female
      (known by UO account registrations) did help us decide on this path. But we will always
      provide female options when feasible.<br>
      <br>
      So, please don't interpret the answer in too deep a fashion, we are just trying to get a
      game out.</font></p>

    <p>Cynthe from the developers team also stopped by with this to say on transparency... </p>

      One more thing...I can understand you're disappointment about Thief not being subtitled,
      but for that game (unlike ours) I think the lack of titles has VERY little impact on the
      game and the product really is so unique and cool I think you should give it a try
      nonetheless. </font></small></p>

      working with EA/LG is that no one has tried to mess with the game for marketing reasons.
      We all share a very clear vision which is to trust in the essential game design and
      aesthetic of the original, add cool technology and deeper RPG elements and make a great
      game. As to the content, they've been enthusiastic and behind us pretty much 100% of the
      way. </font></small></p>

    <small>Those happy Ho's over on EQVault just slipped up a nice little post from Brad that
    was found on the General Discussion boards. Speaking of Brad, still no word from him yet.
    Nothing at all...<font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>not even get well soon card</strong></font>.
    </small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"><small>Hey Brad, can you
      help solve this ongoing debate here on the board? It was mentioned earlier that everyone
      who applied will be in Phase 4. Is this still true? If you have time to answer this,
      please do, so we can stop all these posts about people not getting e-mails. They seem to
      be dominating the boards over the past few days, and there have been precious few other
      topics to chat about. <br>
      Thanks!<br>
      <br>
      <strong>It's true. We took everyone in our beta application database and sent them an
      email. If your information changed, and you submitted more than once, we took the most

    Sith over at Sith Dragon's U:A Website had some new info on Ultima:Ascension from the
    discussion boards. Once again, Seth stopped by to <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>bump up
    the drool factor for us</strong></font>. First, he looks at tying up loose ends in the
    plot, as well as add ons...</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">By all means, people
      should make a Compendium of loose ends. We can't guarantee that we will add everything
      into the game, but we will look through, and see if we can add things from it.<br>
      <br>
      It's hard to think about add ons when we are still finishing the game. Of course, the more
      support / sales the game has, the better the chance of add ons becoming a reality. It too
      early to tell what's next. </font></p>

    <p>He also looks at using the wheelie thing on your mouse for something other than
    webpages...</p>

      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">I have one of those
      new mice with a wheel in the center, and I like it quite a bit. It would be great to
      support the wheel in some way, although I'm not exactly sure how we would want to use it.
      I'll keep you informed on what happens.</font></small></p>

            good example of what can be done with outdoor environments. Full version should be in
