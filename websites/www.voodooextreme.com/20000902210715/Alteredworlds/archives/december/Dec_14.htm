    <small>As always we get some more juicy goodness on WoT's development from my sweaty
    Gorilla friend Glen. <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>This weeks sounds even juicier </strong></font>with
    a little news on getting close to an Alpha.</small></p>
    <font color="#004080"><blockquote>
      <p></font><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">This last milestone was a
      big one. We're getting dangerously close to alpha, so by necessity, lots of elements of
      the game are falling into place. Let me discuss what we've delivered. <br>
      <br>
      The White Tower primitive set is beautiful. My hat is off to the level designers and the
      texture artists for creating some of their best work yet. The architecture is
      conservative, yet powerful. The textures are rich and compelling--definitely the most
      colorful art to date. Every scene is a masterpiece. And the maps that the level designers
      pulled together for this delivery are wonderful as well. There's a ton of stuff here.
      Tim's distinct Shadar Logoth maps really capture the essence of a ruined city. Warren's
      multi-player and single player maps based on the Portal Stone world simply rock. James'
      Whitecloak single-player stuff is outstanding--I can't wait to see the AI up and running
      inside of it. And both Scott's rendition of the Ways and his multi-player map are great;
      just ask him about the magic bread. Warren was right (in his .plan); when we finally
      looked at everything we were delivering, everyone was amazed. <br>
      <br>
      We delivered two characters: the player character and Mashadar. Mashadar is rather
      unconventional, but all the better for it. Against all odds, Steve B. managed to get both
      the player character's skirt and her cloak animated for the milestone; he suspected that
      he'd only be able to do one or the other. She looks great, and Mike Fox has been on an
      integration kick, so it shouldn't be long before we see her in the game. In fact, she
      might already be there. Speaking of mesh and animation integration, many of our characters
      are now running around in the game. Ryan's AI is growing by leaps and bounds. It's
      wonderful to see these guys actually smartening up, doing appropriate stuff in appropriate
      environments. I guess that comes with actually putting the game together, but I still find
      it very cool. <br>
      <br>
      In between bouts of minor civil disobedience (light globes anyone? how about flaming
      skulls?), Aaron's pumped out some terrific stuff. Our spell effects are shaping up,
      Mashadar can be placed from the citadel editor now, and lots of unexpected cool features
      are appearing--such as last week's rain and snow. Robert has been cranking out the art
      assets for these effects, but was just recently distracted by his new baby boy!
      Congratulations go out to our resident effects artist! Although he's taking a few days to
      teach his new son how to play catch, he'll be back shortly. How's that for dedication? I
      hope you all appreciate it by buying three copies of WoT each! <br>
      <br>
      Sam has his hands full with sound effects, and I'm still in voice-recording and UI land.
      Sometime soon, we should actually start seeing some of these cutscenes. The storyboards
      have a lot of promise. Cross your fingers. <br>
      <br>
      In addition to the milestone, we've had a few other developments lately. Specifically,
      Legend has welcomed a few new faces. First, let's talk level design. We've been lucky
      enough to snag some (more) of the best people in the business. <br>
      <br>
      Matthias Worch (a.k.a Langsuyar), accomplished level designer, is joining the Legend team.
      I've known Matthias from way back; based on his work with Beyond Belief, he was one of the
      first lds chosen for the WoT team. He was an off-site free-lance designer, though, and
      quickly got snapped up by Ritual who brought him to the States. I was overjoyed when I
      discovered that I was going to get another chance to work with him. Also, David Kelvin
      (a.k.a Kevlar) has jumped onto the Legend bandwagon. I'm not as familiar with his work,
      but he already has a bunch of experience behind him and everyone has nothing but great
      things to say about his maps. Finally, Mick Beard (a.k.a.Vermoord) has joined the crew as
      a contractor. All of these guys are clearly very talented, and in addition to our already
      stellar group, we're ready for just about anything. Note that they probably won't be
      working on WoT initially. Legend's got lots of other brands in the fire. We're just
      getting warmed up! <br>
      <br>
      On top of all of this, we've also hired one Joel Walden, an experienced texture artist.
      James' recommendation didn't hurt, but Joel's talent got him the job. I'm really looking
      forward to getting Joel into our new art &quot;studio&quot; and seeing what he can do.
      He's a great guy, and I expect great things from him. It's good that we'll be moving to
      our new offices soon. I think we've pretty much outgrown this place. <br>
      <br>
      Lastly, I wanted to mention the new three page spread on WoT in the latest Next Gen which
      should be out on shelves as you read this (although I'll be danged if I can find a copy!).
      There's lots of new screenshots and some new info, so make sure and hunt yerself down a
      copy! <br>
      <br>
      Thanks for coming, but I've gotta run and write more scripts for tomorrow (I think I'll
      have the Trolloc sing, &quot;Ring around the Rosie&quot;). </font></small></p>

      <p></font><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The King's Quest games
      have been the most successful adventure series ever to hit the PC with over 7 million
      copies sold. Roberta Williams pioneered the graphical adventure movement back in 1984 when
      King's Quest I: Quest for the Crown was introduced. It was the first game to fully support
      the newly introduced EGA graphics card. Mask of Eternity is the eighth installment in this
      classic collection. Long gone are the days of 16 or 256 color sprites and text parsing
      commands such as &quot;Open door&quot;. Sierra has put the three plus years since
      King&#146;s Quest VII to good use by implementing a 3D environment and support for 3D
      acceleration. Many &quot;up and coming&quot; adventure game developers cut their teeth on
      the King's Quest series, including designers who eventually went on to make such classic
      series as Space Quest, Leisure Suit Larry, and Gabriel Knight.</font></small></p>

    Thief</strong></font></a><a href="mailto:sacrates@voodooextreme.com"><small> - Sacrates</small></a><br>
    <small>Looks like the GI Ho's over at Games First have decided they were<font color="#FFFFFF"><strong> rubbed the right way </strong></font>with Thief and gave it a
    solid <a href="http://www.gamesfirst.com/Reviews/Greg/Thief/thief.htm">5 of 5 stars review</a>.
    Head on over and give it a read.</small></p>
    <font color="#c0c0c0"><blockquote>
      <p></font><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">First of all,
      Thief--unlike most of the 3D shooters it might initially be mistaken for--is not a
      shoot-&#145;em-up extravaganza featuring some anatomically ridiculous hero who defies
      physics, the law of averages and karmic cycles while obliterating mutants,
      techno-monstrosities and civilizations in his wake. In fact, Thief holds little truck with
      games characterized by lots of noise and action, which isn&#146;t to say that it lacks
      these qualities. This game offers plenty of action, most of it of the sweaty-palmed,
      hair-raising variety. Yet Thief demands that players exercise stealth, silence and economy
      of action in order to proceed through the game. Players stand a better chance of sticking
      around if they choose the surfaces upon which they walk, proceed slowly, and stick to the
      shadows. In addition, Thief is one of the only action titles I can think of which rewards
      players for patience and thoroughness and encourages players to cover their tracks. So
      when players sneak up behind surly manor guards or fanatical zealots and blackjack them,
      for instance, it is crucial to dump the body--in a dark corner, behind a column, in the
      sewer--lest a passerby discover the crime and start screaming, literally, bloody murder.</font></small></p>

    News</strong></font></a><a href="mailto:sacrates@voodooextreme.com"><small> - Sacrates</small></a><br>
    <small>It's about time we got an update from these guys. And boy what an update it is!
    Nothing like information on a Revenant Editor! This news<font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>
    gets me warm in the gorilla like nothing </strong></font>else. Check this update to their <a href="http://www.cinematix.com/news.htm">news section</a>.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><p></i><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The Revenant Editor </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Recently it has become common for
      games to ship with their editors and tools intact. Coupled with the rise of the Internet,
      this practice has led to online map and modification communities based around games like
      Quake, Doom, Starcraft, Unreal, and many others. As we looked around the industry we
      noticed that the RPG genre was severely lacking in this area. Shortly thereafter we made
      the decision to ship Revenant with the editor intact. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">What this means for gamers is the
      ability to build, write, and script their very own RPG's. Perhaps the best aspect of the
      Revenant editor is it's completely tile based. You can simply scroll through the available
      tiles and drag and drop to build. Since they are aligned to a grid the tiles snap together
      like puzzle pieces. Most people should be able to build and light their first rooms in
      less than 15 minutes. The thousands of tiles available are divided into categories such as
      Forests, Caves, Labyrinth, Dungeons, Town, Castle, and many more. Many specialized tiles
      are available as well, such as exits, items, containers, and a plethora of animated 3D
      effects. Once you build your areas you can begin to light them. Revenant's lighting system
      is beautiful to behold, supporting thousands of different colors and intensities. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">For those gamers who wish to get
      even deeper into the Revenant editor, our scripting system will be included in the game as
      well. With the help of our scripting documentation, aspiring designers will be available
      to script in-game cut scenes, special events, traps, exits, enemy artificial intelligence,
      and conversations. More advanced users can use 3D Studio Max or Softimage to create their
      own tiles and characters. Cinematix has also committed itself to supporting the Revenant
      online community with new tilesets, characters, and monsters if the demand is high enough.
      What we have mentioned in this article only scratches the surface of what the editor is
      capable of. As with most editors, the Revenant editor will be technically unsupported but
      we will be including documentation which can be used as reference material. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The Revenant development staff
      has put a massive amount of time and energy into creating a world born of our
      imaginations. It is our sincere wish that game players everywhere will become immersed in
      the world we have created. However, nothing would be more satisfying than to see what all
      of the gamers out there can come up with the Revenant editor in their hands. We hope you
      look forward to playing in our worlds as much as we look forward to playing in yours. </font></small></p>

      Guide?<br>
      All orders get Volo's Guide unless they SPECIFICALLY DECLINE it. For Domestic UPS and
      FedEx, as well as Canadian UPS, shipping costs DO NOT CHANGE regardless of whether you get
      the guide or not, so you should probably not worry about it and get the guide. For all
      other orders, you will need to decide if the premium for shipping is worth the guide. We
      are making sure that Digital River updates their pre-orders to ensure that it shows the
      correct presence of the Volo's Guide.<br>
      <br>
      3) Why is International Shipping so expensive?<br>
      These are actual costs that we have been quoted by FedEx. We will be renegotiating our
      International shipping because we think these costs are excessive - however the costs will
      not change in the short term (in the next month or so). Hopefully these costs will come
      down for additional products.<br>
      <br>
      4) Why am I put on hold for so long when I call the 800#?<br>
      Since I posted the note this morning about shorter hold times, several people have told me
      that they have been put on hold for longer than what it says in my note. Thank you for
      letting us know - we continue to work on improving the system. Long holdtimes suck.<br>
      <br>
      These are the top questions I've been getting (aside from &quot;when?&quot;). Hopefully
      this helps. We are getting a Pre-Order FAQ set up specifically for BG either today or
      tomorrow.</small></font></p>

      many of you on the chat channel this weekend. I have a lot to do - but I'll get to many
      questions as soon as possible. I have 180 emails in my in-basket.<br>
      First priority this morning: Baldur's Gate launch status.<br>
      2nd priority: Launch party kits.<br>
      3rd priority: Pre-order shipment/program status.<br>
      We have national sales meetings this week as well where we will be discussing our product
      plans for first half, 1999 (including Baldur's Gate: Tales of the Sword Coast and
      Planescape: Torment) so I've got a pretty hectic schedule. If you don't hear from me right

      delete emails that I do not respond to. However, if your note is just a general question
      about BG, some times it takes me a couple of weeks to get back to folks. Don't forget - I
      (and my team) work on all Black Isle titles, and are helping with a number of other
      Interplay titles as well in the short term. So you can imagine how many emails I am
      getting in general on Fallout2, Carmageddon2 and Baldur's Gate, not to mention Planescape:
      Torment, Infinite Worlds, and just general inquiries. I apologize if it seems to take a
      long time, but people will defend me on this board for the number of emails I respond to. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">I will be sending out a
      production schedule later today to let everyone know the exact details. Once a product
      goes 'gold' it is a one or two day process to produce a silver production master (and get
      it tested &amp; approved). Then, depending upon scheduling, you produce the CDs (takes
      possibly a couple of days, depending on initial quantities). Then you need to get the
      produce assembled (put the CDs in the holders, assemble the boxes, put everything inside
      of the boxes, shrinkwrap, case, palletize) and move the produce into a distribution
      facility. This can also take a couple of days. Then you ship the product out to retailers
      - and depending upon retailer systems, the product can take an additional day to ten days
      to show up at stores. A few retailers (like EB) really do a great job here and overnight
      product to their distribution centers where the product is turned around overnight so that
      it shows up in most stores the day AFTER we ship. I'll check with our production team and
      get exact timing for everyone. Oh, and the pre-order product may not be following this
      exact schedule because it is 'priority' product. It may be going directly to our
      fulfillment center via bulk container in order to save time (and not have to case it just
      to un-case it one day later). </font></small></p>

      reviews are emerging, I have noticed that some refer to EAX as a feature of DirectSound3D,
      or that Microsoft has included EAX in DirectSound3D in some way. I'd like to set the
      record straight on this. From talking to Brian Schmidt, the Product Manager for
      DirectSound at Microsoft: Microsoft has not included, and currently has no plans to
      include, EAX in DirectSound. There is no special deal with Creative whatsoever. Creative
      is simply using the standard DirectSound property set interface (like many other
      companies) to enable EAX. Microsoft has not done anything specific for EAX, much less
      endorsed it in any way. The perception that there is some kind of deal between the two
      seems to exclusively stem from some cleverly worded Creative press releases. If Microsoft
      does include reverb functionality in DirectX, it might be their own, or Creative's, or
      someone else's. Since reverb is not on the list of DX7 improvements, my guess is that this
      won't be a topic until DX8, probably due in 2000. BTW, the IASIG also has not adopted EAX
      as their industry-open reverb API. Instead they are pushing ahead with the I3D2 reverb API
      (an API that Creative at first supported, but now seems to be backing away from, instead
      pushing EAX 2.0). </small></font></p>

    <blockquote>
      <i><p></i><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">At this stage in
      development, it would NOT be easy to add full WaveTracing support to *this* game.
      (Consider editor changes, in-game changes, database changes, potential modeller
      plugins/exporters to facilitate surface tagging, etc.). Simply passing a set of geometry
      to the Vortex2 processor is probably indeed simple, but that alone does not give you full
      immersion. Geometry itself isn't enough; surface properties must also be taken into
      account, and I see that as the bigger hurdle. (There are obviously other issues, such as
      how our world geometry is divided / organized / loaded, and how that affects downloading
      to the audio processor, which affects framerate, etc., etc.)<br>
      <br>
      The decision to implement EAX was made before the A3D 2.0 SDK was out of beta, and our
      production schedule reflects this. EAX may not provide as mathematically
      &quot;correct&quot; a representation as WaveTracing, but it can be tailored to give good
      effects (we'll have to wait and see how EAX 2.0 does things). If we have time to revisit
      the issue before we ship, who knows, maybe we'll put support in.</font></small><i></p>

      enough that you can bring some creative input to the table. And I'm really happy with how
      the environment turned out overall. Not sure if any screen shots will turn up of it, but

    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Here is where Thief
      shines and surpasses any game currently available. Thief requires that the gamer pay very
      close attention to the game's sounds and surroundings. Where do I start? Thought that
      footsteps were important in games such as Half-Life or Quake 2? Well, Thief takes this to
      an entirely different level. The footsteps are dependent on both floor surface and
      movement speed and Looking Glass executes this perfectly. Carpet, you know that squishy
      soft stuff, is your best friend in Thief while marble and ceramic floors just cause you
      headaches. Also, running in Thief makes a very distinct and different noise than walking
      on the same surface, like in real life. Now, putting all of this together, Thief takes
      advantage of 3D Audio to the fullest. Being able to interpret where footsteps and sounds
      are coming from heightens the Thief playing experience. It supports both A3D and EAX and
      man it sounds awesome on a Live! or MX300. A great feature implemented by Looking Glass is
      the soldier conversations. While sneaking around on various boards, Garrett will overhear
      conversations between two guards and just singing by lonely guards. All these
      conversations are unique and usually add a dose of humor to the rather intense gaming
      atmosphere. </font></small></p>

      of Eternity, although not your father's King's Quest, is still a great game. That's right.
      Even with an overused, watered downed story Mask of Eternity turns out to be one the best
      adventures of the year, with a certain charm that ironically only a King's Quest game
      could offer. It's really a small number of things that sets this game apart too, which,
      concerning its overall size is somewhat ironic in itself. Most adventure games suffer from
      the &quot;play once and you're done with it&quot; syndrome, and this one is no different.
      However, the scope of this game makes that argument look silly. Sierra claims there are
      over 140 hours of gameplay in Mask of Eternity, and even though that's a really generous
      number, the fact is that this game is one heaping adventure, one I believe is full of

      the Lithtech engine. Not a run and gun deathmatch game, Shadows of Reality presents
      players with the unique role-playing experience of mercenaries and hackers, all struggling
      to survive in a harsh and deadly future. If Nevolution can complete their ambitious title,
      they may find an elusive market in a cross section of 3D gamers and RPG fans, all eager to
      get in on the action. </font></small></p>
