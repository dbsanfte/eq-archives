    <small>And still more Baldur's Gate lovin flowing over on the Developer's Corner message
    board. If you are <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>like 90% of the role playing population</strong></font>,
    and pre-ordered BG, you'll want to check out this update from Greg Peterson...</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Let me first say
      that this is what is GOING to happen... it will take about a week for Digital River to get
      all of this in the system correctly, but this is what is GOING to take place.<br>
      <br>
      1) For all Baldur's Gate pre-orders, you will have the option to decide if you want the
      Volo's Guide or not.<br>
      <br>
      2) We originally designed the program assuming that the game and the Volo's Guide would
      weigh under two pounds. As we have gotten closer to finishing the game we have found out
      that the game and guide together weigh MORE than that... and that adding the guide to
      certain international orders would push shipping costs up (in some cases by as much as
      $60). Therefore we will be unable to offer the Volo's Guide with FREE SHIPPING to every
      place in the world.<br>
      <br>
      3) All Volo's Guides are Free... we are not charging anything for the guide itself.<br>
      <br>
      4) Shipping will be charged based on final destination and shipping instructions.<br>
      <br>
      4) To cover EXTRA shipping costs for the guides, we will offer up to $5 credit to cover
      any additional costs driven by the weight of the Volo's Guide. What this means:<br>
      <br>
      Domestic UPS &gt; normally $2 more - so we cover ALL shipping for Volo's Guide.<br>
      Domestic FedEx &gt; normally $5 more - so we cover ALL shipping for Volo's Guide.<br>
      Canada UPS &gt; normally $5 more - so we cover ALL shipping on Volo's Guide.<br>
      These three options cover in excess of 90% of all of the pre-orders.<br>
      All other orders are FedEx and the upcharge will be MORE than $5... you will need to check
      your shipping and decide if you still want the Guide... for example, the upcharge for
      Alaska and Hawaii would be $15... less the $5 credit would mean that you would still have
      to pay $10 extra shipping for the guide. You may decide to opt out of the program (or
      not).<br>
      <br>
      5) Before we ship, we will have ALL orders corrected in the system. We will assume that
      ALL domestic orders and Canadian UPS orders will want the Volo's guide (since the guide is
      free and there are no added shipping charges). We will check the online site to confirm
      Volo's Guides in all other orders. I will let people know when all of the orders are
      corrected so you can check your order status.<br>
      <br>
      6) You can cancel/change your order at any time (up until ship date) without penalty. We
      will give everyone in the WORLD notification when the product has silvered... that will be
      your notice that you have about 5 working days before your order becomes final.<br>
      <br>
      In terms of the priority shipping stuff... just to confirm: the first production units off
      our production line will be express shipped to Digital River, who will pack all orders and
      ship all orders out within 24 hours. With the fastest shipping options, we are targeting
      to deliver product about the same time that it first shows up in the first, fastest
      stores.<br>
      <br>
      All of this information will be copied to our web site and the Interplay store, as soon as
      people come back from Thanksgiving vacation.</font></small></p>

    <small>You know sometimes here at AW we love to use buttery language and have fun posting
    news about games. But sometimes our opinions clash with our readers and they get a tad
    pissed at us. So with that said, we are giving you guys the chance to<font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>
    lash back with your best</strong></font>. Oh yes, I want to see how artistic you guys can
    be with some well placed insults aimed at any or all of the AW staff. For those that have
    the most flowery insults imaginable I will post them for all to see. As long as they are
    within the realm of language that Bow and I use. Remember we are a rated G site here. (<font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>G for God awfull psychologically harmfull RPG news</strong></font>)
    Anyway, I may not get any responses for this but at least it's worth the try. We're just
    looking to have some fun. You know, something that will make us feel all warm and fuzzy
    like &quot;Sacrates smells like the rectum of an unwashed Canadian Moose&quot; or
    &quot;Bowmeister sounds like a Wookie on Crack&quot;. </small></p>

    <small>Another day, another flood of info on the Developer's Corner message boards. First
    and foremost is Greg Peterson's response to <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>the wingnut that
    freaked out</strong></font> saying the .wav files and other info on Baldur's Gate
    Chronicles was going to ruin the game for him.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Rather than
      commenting on the BG Chronicles issue specifically, I just want to comment on pre-release
      infobits and the challenges.<br>
      <br>
      We want to keep people up-dated on the development of the game. We want people to get a
      feel for how cool this game is going to be. It is impossible to do that without releasing
      SOME materials to the public. Arguably, this post could have been about screen shots, or
      equipment icons, or character portraits, or ANYTHING that is going to be in the final game
      because they all do, at some level, reveal material that would otherwise be a 'surprise'
      the first day you open the box. It is a constant challenge for us, and one that we take
      very seriously.<br>
      <br>
      We try NOT to release major spoilers. This includes in the game manual, with our fan
      sites, with the commercial online sites, and with magazines. Even the Strategy Guide does
      NOT include everything in the game. Once you play the game, you will see how very little
      we have actually revealed. We want people to play the game and to 'discover' it
      first-hand. <br>
      <br>
      So we have a problem - to some people, a sound file comparison is a betrayal of
      confidence, while to others it is an interesting update in game development, while to
      others it is not all that interesting (sorry to say I fall into that last group...). So we
      try to balance ALWAYS the needs of different groups. (And no, I did NOT give Silverdawn
      the sound info).<br>
      <br>
      I hope that people understand that we are not just randomly tossing stuff out for public
      consumption. If you are cruising a fan site, or happen to be checking out a preview, and
      you see that something is available that you think might spoil your game experience, just
      avoid it. But at least rest easy that if we have released the information, we have done so
      only after we have evaluated it and felt confident that knowing the information will NOT
      diminish your ultimate game experience.</font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>Then Luke showed up with some info on combat and the auto-pause feature...</p>
    </small><blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The auto-pause at
      the end of a character's round only occurs when that character is actively in combat
      (trying to attack, and thus operating within the 6-second rounds. The rounds are not
      universally tracked from game beginning or anything, they activate on an individual basis
      for characters actively in range of hostiles). If you are not engaged in combat, you are
      not in a round and walk freely (though the screen automatically centers on the character
      that causes the auto-pause (in single player), so trying to do something else while other
      characters are in auto-pause combat would be a big headache. You don't want to be
      disregarding combat like this anyway). <br>
      <br>
      I myself only have the auto-pause activate when a weapon becomes unusable (breaks, out of
      ammo). Not having the &quot;pause on sight of hostile&quot; means that I am surprised
      occasionally, but it's more fun that way (more akin to true AD&amp;D. I also play with the
      character's green &quot;circles&quot; turned off. It just looks better). This is
      definitely not to say I do not pause (I do, VERY often), but certainly not every round for
      every player. That gets tedious very very fast. It is an approximation of turn-based by
      customer demand, but it is not meant to be an exact equivalent. BG just doesn't operate
      that way, but IMHO even the most ardent turn-based fan will like being able to take their
      turn whenever they wish, and not having to sit through multiple-enemy maneuvers is really
      nice as well. <br>
      <br>
      I want to address something else said in this thread as well. Combat is NOT scripted such
      that the scripts do everything for you. They can do quite a lot, but if you do not take
      control of the characters yourself in all but the smallest encounters you are in big
      trouble. The scripts are great emergency measures, but they will not play the game for
      you.<br>
      <br>
      Take that mage and direct his spells exactly where you wish, position your fighters as
      blocking frontlines, and sneak your thieves around the perimeter. The scripts will tell
      your wizard to cast, your fighter to attack, and your thief to backstab, but nowhere near
      as effectively as if they are actively directed and specific actions are chosen.</font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>And finally a little bit from Ben (woohoo he's alive!) on thieves...</p>
    </small><blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The base scrore is
      based off your DEX and racial bonuses. THEN you get points that you can spend wherever you
      want. You get points everytime you go up levels as per AD&amp;D rules. So yes you can
      specialize in stealth and pick locks (my favorite two :)) </font></small></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"><small>Ok here's my
      thoughts on Everquest. i am open to any discussions. here goes.</small></font></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Everquest is nowhere near a new
      UO. It is a glorified diablo/descent to undermountain/AD&amp;D. Unlike in UO, you have no
      chance to earn a living in EQ. what does this mean? No profession skills. Just
      adventuring!</font></small></p>
      <p><strong><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">While the focus is indeed
      on adventuring and questing, there are many trade skills as well.</font></small></strong></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Sure, it will be popular
      for...oh...3 months. But after that time people will get bored after they have super
      characters that can kill all the monsters with two hits and have their pk switch off so
      the only thing they CAN do is kill those monsters.</font></small></p>
      <p><strong><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The game is designed to
      take at least 1 year to max out a character, but that said, you can change to +pvp at any
      time.</font></small></strong></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Second major point: Lag. If you
      think UO has lag, wait till you get your copy of EQ. UO: cartoonish graphics with
      thousands of users...major lag. EQ: Quake II'ish graphics with the same number of
      users...you get the picture.</font></small></p>
      <p><strong><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">3d graphics do NOT mean
      more lag -- there's no more information required to be sent across the net with a 3d game
      than a 2d.</font></small></strong></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">and my last point: guilds. ok i
      know this seems odd, but it isn't. With the 1000 player max on any server, it will become
      increasingly harder to establish a guild. You'll have members getting a &quot;Server is
      full&quot; message right before a guild war or something</font></small></p>
      <p><strong><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Our target capacity is

    the jar of cherry flavored vasoline for the Lap Dancer) I'll make this real simple for

      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">This game has all the RPG
      tappings, stats, skills, exploration, and a great story. However, it feels a bit like an
      adventure game at this point. I find myself waving my mouse back and forth looking for the
      hot spot that I can interact with. Many doors, and objects are just gloss without the
      ability to interact with them at all. Not even a this door is locked style message. Your
      character also moves from screen to screen, kinda like the older kings quest games. There
      are however other characters moving about that you can sometimes interact with. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The instruction book tries to
      sell this as a series of camara views like in a movie. I don't buy it. If the game moved
      like Redguard I would be ecstatic. Anyway, think movement is like kings quest with no
      screen scrolling. You walk near the edge of the screen or closer to a side of the street
      and the screen switches to a different view sometimes closer, sometime from above,
      sometimes from behind and sometimes from the front. It makes it very easy to get confused
      as to which way you were going.</font></small></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Welcome back.&nbsp;
      I'm not planning to write a whole lot today, but I do want to give you something to tide
      you over.&nbsp; Just yesterday, I received a shiny gold CD of the new music by Robert
      Berry and Leif Sorbye. &nbsp; The pieces cover some of the darker environments such as
      Shadar Logoth and the Ways, but I thought I'd share one with you based on the White
      Tower.&nbsp; Remember that the Berry/Sorbye team is producing the in-game music (with
      possible additional music from Eric Herberling), while Andy Frazier is producing the cut
      scene score.&nbsp; Grab yourself an MP3 player and listen to this 4 meg <a href="http://www.wheeloftime.com/WhiteTower.mp3">beauty</a> (copyright Legend
      Entertainment blah blah blah).&nbsp; I don't have to tell you that Robert and Leif are
      doing an excellent job; I think the music speaks for itself. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Everything is running in high
      gear, and people are doing great work.&nbsp;&nbsp; We've almost put together all of the
      necessary Aes Sedai primitive architecture required for the upcoming milestone; now all
      they need is more textures, and the artists (Paul, Julie, and Marc) are cranking those out
      too.&nbsp; James is making some wonderfully curved exteriors, while being beautiful, are
      still speedy.&nbsp; Scott has started on the Ways world map.&nbsp; Now that Aaron has
      Machin Shin running, I can tell you that the experience is going to be absolutely
      terrifying.&nbsp; I've seen Machin Shin coming for me now.&nbsp; All that remains are the
      sounds.&nbsp; In multiplayer, this dynamic is going to be extremely cool (picture using
      Swap Places right before being consumed by the Black Wind; get the idea?).&nbsp; Warren's
      hard at work on the Portal Stone world level, along with the primitives he's built. &nbsp;
      The design is very cool--I can't wait to see it realized.&nbsp; Tim has created a
      wonderful Shadar Logoth map and is working on the sequel as we speak.</font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Speaking of Shadar Logoth, Aaron
      now has Mashadar up and running (or flowing).&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm going to be intentionally
      vague about how he works, because he's extremely cool and I want there to be something
      left for the release of the game that you don't know about.&nbsp; He has also continued to
      bang out the artifacts and has most of them working up to spec.</font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">With Kathleen, I'm trying to
      wrestle the cut scenes to the ground.&nbsp; We went through hours of voice auditions
      today, but we have most of the parts assigned.&nbsp; One of the nice things about making
      games for a while is building up a stable of talented voice actors, and the contacts to
      meet new ones.&nbsp; Everyone we have slated for this game is really skilled. &nbsp;&nbsp;
      One of the reasons I'm in this business is to have people more talented than I bring my
      vision to life; having these actors and actresses read my lines makes me remember
      that.&nbsp; An interesting note: normally games usually have more male roles than
      female.&nbsp; Since this game was based on Robert Jordan's books, it's chock full of
      strong female parts including, of course, the main character.&nbsp;&nbsp; One session of
      voice recording starts tomorrow with more to come later.</font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Mark is tackling engine-level
      features and fixes, along with some fundamental UI work.&nbsp;&nbsp; Jim is integrating
      his newly working traps into the build.&nbsp; Ryan continues in his ongoing crusade to
      defeat the AI beast, while Mike F. is integrating all of Steve B.'s new animations. &nbsp;
      Our next milestone calls for working grunts and captains, so again, these guys are working
      hard.</font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">That's got to be all for now.
      &nbsp; I've lost the day to auditions, so I've got to catch up.</font></small></p>
