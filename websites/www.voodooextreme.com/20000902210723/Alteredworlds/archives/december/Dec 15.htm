    lately as they are this.................close to going Gold. Here's some good stuff on

      ohmygod!&quot;. You will see the news here first. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Second, I wanted to keep this
      post talking about BG development... so I though I'd start a thread talking about the
      expansion(s). At this point we have one in the works and have a LOT of suggestions for the
      development. I would like to pose this question for discussion... </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Would people be interested in 2
      expansion packs (as add-ons to the current game) BEFORE we came out with an additional
      free-standing BG game? IF so, how might you structure the progression of the games - how
      would you handle experience points, levels, etc? Do people like the xp caps or think it is
      too artificial? </font></small></p>

    Preview</strong></font></a> <a href="mailto:sacrates@voodooextreme.com"><small>- Sacrates</small></a><br>
    <small>Just got word from Tim Williams the Creative Director over at Planet Moon Studios
    that Next Gen just slapped up a <a href="http://www.next-generation.com/jsmid/news/5285.html">Giants Special </a>that you may
    want to see. He's been breaking me down for a few weeks now and I have finally submitted.
    This game looks like all the Biz and has a ton of innovation. <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Not
    to mention it's got quite a few RPG Elements</strong></font>. Here's a small biscuit.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"><small>Giants looks set to
      include many different gameplay features in an attempt to break the tired molds of
      traditional gaming genres, as Creative Director Tim Williams explained: &quot;The action
      will certainly be fast and furious, but as the game progresses the player will notice many
      levels of complexity that will start to build up in parallel. For example, if you play as
      the Meccaryns you'll first find yourself having to rescue your four teammates, then later
      in the game you'll actually have to set up a base and capture some creatures to work for
      you. You'll be able to sneak into enemy camps and kidnap creatures that will work for you,
      giving yourself an edge over your opponent. On top of this your Mecc teammates will be
      growing more and more intelligent, which will directly affect their skill in battle. As
      you can see, although this is most definitely an action based game there are elements of
      both RPGs and strategy that add spice to it and retain its longevity.&quot;</small></font></p>

    <small>Sadly the faces in U:A will not be animated in the game. Just noticed this piece of
    over at Sith's Love shack. I was hoping for something at least similar to Half Life's
    facial expressions. Oh well, <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>better this than having system

      100,000 consumers each pay US$ 9.95 per month to play in the persistent online medieval
      fantasy role-playing game, Ultima Online, created by ORIGIN Systems, Electronic Arts'
      Austin, Texas-based subsidiary. <br>
      <br>
      &quot;Ultima Online has truly set the standard by which other online-only games will be
      judged, from both a technology and a sales standpoint,&quot; said Larry Probst, EA's
      chairman and chief executive officer. &quot;We have been surprised and pleased with the
      product sales and longevity of this game. We have thousands of players who play daily -
      and have done so for more than a year. It's truly remarkable.&quot; Probst continued,
      &quot;From a business perspective, Ultima Online has proven to be a winner. If Ultima
      Online was a separate, stand alone company, it would be one of the few profitable Internet

      games you mentioned and the one that sticks in my mind most is Ecstatica. Great concept
      but the camera switching was detrimental to the game play. Nothing like having the camera
      switch angles in the middle of combat so you cannot see your opponent,or maybe you only
      see his back and you cannot see much else. Our game utilizes the camera positioning
      changes during conversations or perhaps in some scripted sequences. They are used to
      convey a view of the scene normally not observed. Perhaps it is to see an assassin moving
      into position behind you while you rtalk to the mild mannered reporter. Other times it is
      used just as a mechanism to show the player character from an outside perspective while he
      is discussing matters with an NPC. The player will still be making the conversation
      choices, we are just going to be showing the scene from a slightly different angle. There
      will be no loss of game play as in Ecstatica and you will get to see what your character
      looks like too. </font></small></p>

      <i><p></i><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">You are correct in that
      MP3 is an excellent compression scheme and has very good sound quality. However,
      DurhamDragon is also correct in that using MP3 would have a severe performance penalty. To
      use MP3, you'd either have to (1) decompress on-the-fly, which would drastically impact
      framerate and other game functions, or (2) decompress at level-load time, store the audio
      in memory, and playback the uncompressed data, a technique which would require large
      amounts of memory. In our case, that memory is better used by object/terrain meshes and/or
      data caches so you can see more on the screen at once, get better perfomance, smoother
