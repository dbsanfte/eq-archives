    before it sold out. First impressions....<font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>this game is simply
    amazing.</strong></font> It's the kind of game that you only see come along occasionally.
    Diablo, Half Life, etc etc. We have been covering this gem at AW long and hard for a while
    now and am happy to say it's 100% worth it. <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>The music is
    absolutely fantastic </strong></font>and is something that impressed me. Sounds very
    similar to Conan the Barbarian. I also was able to procure a copy of Tribes for myself too
    so you can expect VERY sporadic updates. With that said, you have obviously figured out
    that Baldur's Gate has arrived so what are you doing sitting there for? Go get it if you

    <small>Well, here we are. Christmas Eve and still no hide nor hair of Everquest Beta.
    Although for that now though, I am thinking mid to late January. That's also depending on
    if they've got the cd's duplicated yet. Although I don't think they would have duped them
    just yet, since I would think they would want to get all the info on them rather than have
    you dload a big mofo of a patch when you get on, especially with this new sound system
    going in soon in B3. Either way, your going to have Baldur's Gate to pass the time until
    then, and<font color="#FFFFFF"><strong> I seriously doubt your gonna finish that in a
    month</strong></font>. Not exactly sure what to think of today in terms of news however.
    Just check back and you'll see it here if there is.</small></p>

    <small>Today feels like a dream. An absolute ton of RPG news was flowing around the Net.
    Not to mention quite a bit of good info on Baldur's Gate and Everquest. Although some of
    these guys need to work on their writing skills who are doing the Previews of EQ. &nbsp;
    Not that I am pointing the spotlight mind you. <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Nor am I

    guess for Baldur's Gate to be in stores, however just make sure you pre-ordered that puppy
    or your gonna be playing with the blow up dolls a couple of extra days. Also it looks good
    that Tribes will be there also. Sounds like a fairly expensive day for Sacrates, since I
    didn't get around to asking for an Eval copy of BG and didn't want to wait for it to
    arrive. Now that's a gamer damnit! Keep checking back though...AW will keep the news

      to be the fountain of all evil on this board I thought I would post all the facts.... </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">-Normal &quot;expedited&quot;
      turn around time from the delivery of a final master to staging finished goods ready for
      shipment to customers is 10 days. This process includes duplicating the disks at one site,
      moving the disks to the assembly site, assembly of the product, moving the assembled
      product to our warehouse and then staging the product for shipment to individual
      retailers. In the case of Baulder's Gate, Disc 1 went gold late Thursday 12/17 meaning
      assembly could not even begin till the weekend. A all out effort is being made by all
      parties involved to get these tasks done quicker so that some customers had the potential
      to have the product for the holidays. Due to the fact that the product is 5 CD's assembly
      is time consuming. For a variety of reasons we are running only about one 8 hour shift
      behind where we thought we would be building the product. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">-We have run into a few
      roadblocks the largest is the availability of trucks in the southeast to transfer product
      from the assembly house to our warehouse to stage for shipping. This problem is continuing
      even as I type this and only 26,000 units have been delivered. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">-There is no &quot;plot&quot;
      involved involving our direct customers. As I believe had been consistently stated, DR
      picked up the first units that were completed, shipped them to their warehouse and began
      processing. We are not in control of how quickly DR systems turn around the product. We
      are DR's highest priority customer and put lots of pressure on them so they are moving as
      fast as possible. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">-EB and Babbages and a few
      other's are Will Call customers who send their own trucks to pick up product from our
      warehouse. We do not control the timing of those truck pick up's nor do we control how
      they disperse to their individual stores. Our sales department is in constant contact with
      them and are trying to get a substantial portion (over 50%) of their orders ready for pick
      up and based on how they decide to process some of this product may be in stores tomorrow.
      We do not control that decision. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">-Whether Interplay has cash or
      not is totally irrelevant to the discussion. We are on fine terms with our vendors this is
      simply a logistics problem. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">-A lot of people at Bioware,
      Interplay development and QA worked extremely hard to final the game, but the reality is
      that it did go final in late December the worst time of year for shipping to be
      predictable. Further, the people in Interplay operations as well as other departments have
      given up their vacation to expedite this process. </font></small></p>

      and murky caverns of Ak'Anon, the open night air seemed, even through a computer monitor,
      to provide obvious relief for the two spelunking characters. We walked down the path away
      from the city, intent on doing some Dragon-hunting (watching, really). A little further
      down the path we spotted the Necromancer that Ten had been helping earlier. Zani, level 1
      and unfamiliar with the lands in and outside of Ak'Anon, was walking past a Gnome Watchman
      (a guard), not knowing the danger that she was in. Within moments, the Watchmen had struck
      her down and resumed his watch over his patch of dirt path. We waited to make sure she'd
      gotten her stuff without incident before heading back out in search for the Young Ebon
      Dragon we'd spotted earlier that day. </font></small></p>

      You might think about going with our &quot;recommended&quot; level of RAM, though; RAM is
      cheaper to upgrade than your CPU, and you'll benefit in all your Windows apps. Our

      will specifically say &quot;clipping plane&quot;. It may read something like &quot;More
      Speed &lt;-----------&gt; More Detail&quot;. Selecting &quot;more detail&quot; would move
      the clipping plane out further. But I think the current plan is for a slider just for the
      clipping plane.</font></small></p>

      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The game takes a third person
      view, somewhat similar to what the combat scenes looked like in the original. With this
      view, it means there is a lot of point and clicking. Some things I found particularly
      annoying were drawn from this view mode. There was one scene in the game where you would
      get stuck and the camera wouldn't shift to a new screen. I wasn't able to ever determine
      if it's a problem with the game or intentional (there's nothing important where the
      &quot;glitch&quot; happens, so that makes me think it's intentional, but the way it looks
      makes it look like a bug). There's no way to change movement speed and that sort of
      bothered me. As nice as it looks, I really don't like the time it takes to walk across one
      screen after I've already been there ten times. Assessing unknown inventory was another
      slight nuisance I experienced. It also takes too many clicks to identify items, I
      suggested that there should have been shortcut keys to the keyboard. </font></small></p>
