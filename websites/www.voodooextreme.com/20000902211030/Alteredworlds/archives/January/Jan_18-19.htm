    This first one is particularly interesting in that you probably won't be able to afford a
    house alone. <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Hell, you can barely afford Plate or Chain mail
    armor alone as it is</strong></font>. I love this idea. Chances of you being able to
    afford Plate within the first at least 3 months of solid (And I mean solid 8 hour day)

      and most of the major issues have been resolved.&nbsp; We should have a stable, up-to-date
      WoT build any time now.</font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The level designers now have a

    </blockquote>
    <p><small>By the way, his first question is totally true. I like the fact that you can
    actually get knocked into a bad wet dream before your impending death. Makes it that much
    more dramatic with you sitting there staring on in horror as a few Orcs get medevil on
    your unconcious ass. I've actually been able to escape this too...where someone would come
    along and help right after I got knocked out, so I got up and ran like a one legged
    Halfling. Anyway, here's a bit on Quests.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Quests provide a nice diversion.
      If you are in the area of Freeport, Rivervale, Erudin, and espicially Qeynos, there are a
      lot of quests. For instantance, in Qeynos, virtually every named NPC has or is part of a
      quest. Some quests require further killing, some require travel, and others escorting.
      There is even a spy mission or two. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Trade skills will also provide a
      nice diversion, as you can't exactly run around killing while working on your skills and
      selling your wares. Well, i suppose you can, but at least its something else. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">And hey! If all else fails you
      could try socializing :)</font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>Even more on quests etc.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">As a powergamer, one thing you
      will want to keep in mind is that the best items in the game will come through questing. I
      hear powergamers like toys :) </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">As for the quests, steps are
      being taken now to make sure that people don't feel like they are playing &quot;Guess the
      magic keyword&quot; like in UO. They are already far more indepth, but some people still
      find it hard to figure out what to ask the NPCs. One thing to keep in mind is that you
      must speak in complete properly punctuated sentences. One thing you do is actually read
      what they say, the thing you ask must be in thier text. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">For instance, if you say hello to
      an NPC and they start complaining about the Pirates of Katharg, you might try asking
      &quot;Who are the Pirates of Katharg?&quot;. Just saying &quot;Pirates of Katharg?&quot;
      will usually not work. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Just remember the 5 W's and H.
      Who, what, when, where, why, and how. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Who are the Pirates of Katharg?<br>
      What do the Pirates of Katharg want from you?<br>
      When will the Pirates of Katharg attack?<br>
      Where can I find the Katharg of Gunthak?<br>
      Why are the Pirates of Katharg killing your people?<br>
      How do I defeat the Pirates of Katharg?</font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>Here's another important little feature you'll notice about EQ when you first
    start playing.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"><small>No, you cannot see how many
      hitpoints, but you can see a health bar. The health bar purposefully lags behind the hit
      to show impact to simulate the amount of time that a large hit might take to show damage.
      For instance, if you hit a creature with 100 HP's for 50, it might take 2 or 3 seconds for
      the bar to start moving, and another 2 or 3 seconds for it to get down to 50%.<small> </small>It
      really makes your heart leap up into your throat the first time you take on that new and
      dangerous looking critter and hit it 3 times for all you are worth before you see it's
      healthbar move :)</small></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>Here's an even more interesting bit on racial balances in the game.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">No dual wield. Also, dwarves
      aren't as liked by the other races as say, a human. Not to mention, due to the racial
      advantages of being a dwarf (e.g. infravision, sense heading bonus, Strength and Stam),
      you can expect a sizable experience penalty for playing one, and your agility is lower. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">However, one thing I would like
      ot stress is that STATS are not the be all and end all. Stats are the LAST modifier used
      to determine the stregth of a hit, the amount of mana, etc. First is skill, followed by
      level (which are closely intertwined). </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Then take into account that
      people will gravitite to magic items that improve thier stats as a character. For
      instance, dwarves will not be as interested in items that raise strength as those that
      raise agility. Humans will be more interested in strength. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">That's the purpose of balance. A
      wood elf warrior is no worse a warrior than an ogre warrior. Even at 50th level, I'd
      expect naked fight between the two, tactics not withstanding, to go even. Sure, the ogre
      is stronger by far, but the elf is much more agile (harder to hit) and dexterous (has
      better control of thier blade) than the ogre. It all balances out. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">-Abashi, Everquest Guide </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">P.S. I try to convince people of
      this daily, they never buy it. Of course, not everyone else has taken classes of differnet
      races and matched them up like that before.</font></small></p>

      It's been approximately two hours since my last session with Bioware's old-school RPG,
      although I'm sure that will change as soon as I finish this article. So far, I've missed
      phone calls, deadlines, and special appointments because of this game. I've yet to lose
      any friends or alienate any family members, but I'm sure it's only a matter of time. </font></p>

      been written. Gilles is looking into the feasibility of including 3d card support and we
      should know shortly what form and when this will be implemented. 99% of the art has been
      completed and approved. The clipping has been started and other data entry has begun. All
      in all it&#146;s more than on schedule. The quality level for the mission pack is amazing.
      We actually had to &quot;dummy down&quot; some of the art because it looked &quot;too
      good&quot;. BG2 is going to look soooo good. I think everyone will want to play this

    Yeah, the game starts out slow but to me this is easily, the greatest RPG in existence.
    There is nothing else out there with this much depth and sheer size. (Other than maybe
    South Park) Anyway, IGN.PC have kicked up their own<a href="http://pc.ign.com/reviews/9942.html"> hot and spicey </a>on the game.</small></p>

    <small>Looks like Avaris from Bifrost is <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>holding on for dear
    life</strong></font>. Just got word that they are indeed still looking for a publisher to
    cover the overhead. We had an Interview with Donald a while back but due to the problems
    they were experiencing were unable to post it. Here's the blurb.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p class="tablefont"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Yes, we are
      still alive! I'm sure most of you have been wondering :-) </font></small></p>
      <p class="tablefont"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Well, I
      suspected a very luke-warm reception from publishers and that's exactly what happened. In
      the last few months I've been in contact with lots of people and have been given the same
      line by all of them: small, relatively unknown development teams will not be advanced all
      that much money. Because of Avaris' AI, it is still going to require an awful lot of
      development time putting it above publisher's budgets.</font></small></p>
      <p class="tablefont"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">I do not plan
      on simply rolling over and playing dead, though :-) Initially I thought about creating an
      adventure game set in the Troll Wars, about 40 years before the current story takes place.
      Because it would have been an adventure game and because it would have featured only a
      partial implementation of the AI, it would have been a lot less expensive to make. I don't
      feel that this would be the right track to take, though. What I'd like to try now is to
      concentrate on finishing the design and implementation of the AI. I then hope to try to
      license it to a larger developer for use in an RPG or adventure game. That would give us
      enough capital to bring Avaris itself to market.</font></small></p>
      <p class="tablefont"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">I'd like to
      thank you all for all of your help and suggestions up until now. If you are still
      interested in keeping up with the game, stay subscribed to the list or check the web page
      periodically - ya, I know it's looking REALLY corporate right now, but you can jump

      the year. Needless to say I been releasing the news in the message boards instead of
      posting it here. Sorry about that. The Map of Krythoth is official, and we do plan to
      release actual maps of area's within Krythoth. So expect to see some city and village
      layouts so you can get a basic understanding what to expect. We are starting to finalize
      with Kaids Help all the buttons, and panels and overlays in the game. The guess ok is
      being removed has we start to actually close up things for the alpha. The character
      creation is coming to a close, along with spell creation and selection. The team here is
      working on the last set of levels and guilds that need to be converted to 16 bit. Our
      Particle affects are also being implemented into the game so spells are going to look
      better then ever. Monsters are being produced by Kaid and Ross Systems. As you can see all
      the pets are modeled and are being animated as this is being typed. We hope to have at
      least 60+ monsters in the alpha test. We will be adding a new link soon called Monsters.
      This is where we plan to list along with descriptions some of the monsters you will expect
      to see in the game. Communication is still up in the air, but the say, yell command is
      starting to win us over. So please stop by the forum and put your views in. We do listen,
      this is where you the user gets to tell us what you would like to see. </font></small></p>
