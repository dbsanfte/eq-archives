    </strong><small>by <a href="mailto:sacrates@voodooextreme.com">Sacrates</a></small></em></p>
    <p align="left"><small>Beautifull naked woman: Oh Sacrates, it's so big......</small></p>
    <p align="left"><small>Sacrates: Yes I know, it's been given to me by my parents.</small></p>
    <p align="left"><small>BNW: You have such skill and how were you able to.......</small></p>
    <p align="left"><small>Sacrates: Practice makes perfect.</small></p>
    <p align="left"><small>As they both look at the stick figure painting of the woman that he
    had just completed. (What else were you thinking Perv?) He stands up, stretches and heads
    over to his computer to start up a session of Everquest as she lays seductively at his
    feet.</small></p>
    <p align="left"><small>BNW: So what's with your addiction to this game?</small></p>
    <p align="left"><small>Sacrates: Every Gamer dies, but not every gamer truly lives.......</small></p>
    <p align="left"><small>That in a capsule is why Everquest is so great. You will never be
    able to experience all this game has to offer. The world is huge for you to explore, there
    are so many items for you to acquire unique and rare, and most important, creatures to
    kill and people to meet. Now that I have become literate and knowledgable in the ways of
    Everquest let me take you on a journey through this unique world. I will enlighten you to
    it's greatness and expose you to it's &quot;few&quot; flaws.</small><br>
    <small>I had a brief chat with Brad Mcquaid, the head honcho over at the newly named
    RedEye Interactive on a few issues that have been bothering me lately. I came out feeling
    confident most of these issues will be resolved by the final release and will not reflect
    the end product. These are simply a few noticable flaws that stuck out to me and a few
    other beta testers. With that said, let me hit on a few recent issues before I jump in the
    sack with Brad.</small><br>
    <small>As a few of you know who have been keeping in touch with EQ lately, Phase 3.5 of
    the beta has been released for download to all current Beta testers of 3.0. After
    downloading this fat mofo I quickly start it up and jump right in. First thing I notice is
    the world is a much brighter place now. Brighter in the fact that the textures have been
    incredibly improved upon. There is now detail and characteristics to items and the
    environment. You can see Dirt on the giant monolith structures outside of Felwithe was my
    first impression. The grass, instead of looking blurry now had more defenition. Everything
    looked much cleaner including Player character models. </small><br>
    <small>Many of the bugs to this point had been fixed. I also noticed new paths throughout
    the Faydark areas making travel much easier so you didn't get lost quite as much. From
    what I hear, there were quite a few changes made to the discerning eye. Overall it was an
    impressive jump from one phase to the next and I greatly look forward to seeing how Phase
    4 looks. I can honestly say this game will put you in a whole new world. For those of you
    looking for the Halfling Pimp Class, i'm sorry but they haven't added that yet. </small><br>
    <small>After playing this game for hours on end, where food and water are annoyances and
    all you want to do is play, I have noticed a few flaws. Believe me, these are incredibly
    minor glitches, some regarding gameplay and others not. First and foremost is one you've
    probably heard if you have been visiting any of the message boards. Spawn Camping has
    become quite in vogue in EQ right now, where players would run from one camp to another
    waiting for spawns. The problem with this is that you would have 6 players waiting in line
    for 3 creatures to spawn. I swear one time I thought I saw Mickey Mouse walk by. It felt
    like you were waiting in a line at Disney.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080FF">Brad: </font><font
      face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">We are doing two things to address this issue.
      &nbsp;&nbsp; First, we're not done putting items and treasure and such in, so by release
      there will be many more 'spawn' points, which should spread the treasure seekers out quite
      a bit more.&nbsp; Secondly, we are experimenting with some anti-camping measures, such
      that items only appear on an NPC every so often, as opposed to a % chance.&nbsp; What this
      means is that once you've received an item of note from an NPC's corpse, you're not going
      to see it again for some time.&nbsp; The group might as well move on to another spot.
      &nbsp; We hope this will get people moving around more.</font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left"><small>This was my greatest worry to this point in Everquest. Beyond this
    point everything else was minor annoyances. My next concern was regarding Quests and how
    they would be handled and integrated into Everquest. Obviously we aren't going to be
    searching down Crack dealing Orcs here but I was wondering how they would be handled. I
    made an example to Brad that if you were to return to your Guild Master after having
    leveled up and the Guild Master may say something like:</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font color="#8080C0">&quot;thou art a budding adventurer to our guild,
      twould be wise of you to venture further into the world into the lands of Dwarves and kill
      the Goblins that have been plaguing their lands and mayhaps it would also be wise to
      employee the help of other adventuers in your cause. Return to me or others of our order
      when&nbsp; you feel you have helped cleanse the lands further evil&quot;</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left"><small>Thus giving your character and yourself some purpose in the world
    other than simply getting lost and wondering where to go next rather than getting stuck
    sitting around spawn camps. After all this is EverQUEST.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080FF">Brad: </font><font
      face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080C0">I really think we can address a lot of that by
      just putting in more and more quests, some of which working the way you've described with
      guildmasters and all.&nbsp; Quests are being entered into the world daily, and will
      continue to be up to and beyond release (which is something great online games can do).</font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left"><small>Something else that I really didn't notice until I reached about
    8th level is that once you do get into higher levels of play Health takes a while to
    regenerate. Literally you could have a few woman over for an orgy all the while waiting
    for your Health to regenerate. &quot;Hold on girls, let me see......ah ok, only halfway
    there, we've got plenty of time&quot;.&nbsp; </small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080FF">Brad: </font><font
      color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">We will be experimenting with different healing
      rates based on level.&nbsp; That said, it's still very key to be grouping with healers of
      some sort (shaman, cleric, bard) at higher levels.</font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left"><small>Ok so he's got a point there. My last minor problem was in the
    Interface. To navigate Everquest particular in closed and confined areas you have to use
    the directional keys to move forward etc. Well, when your in the heat of battle it kind of
    looks like you are going into Epileptic conculsions on your keyboard trying to contort
    your body just enough to hit that key on the other end of the keyboard. I swear I think I
    would rather have an alien rectal probe than doing that at times.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Bookman Old Style" color="#8080FF">Brad: </font><font
      color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Have you tried the mouselook functionality?
      &nbsp; I think it needs some tweaking here and there, but overall is very usable.</font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left"><small> Although with that said, it does become easier down the road and
    less cumbersome. Particularly learning the Auto-run feature which to most EQ players is a
    gift from the gods. Remember those times in Diablo or UO where you had to stop and type
    just to get a message to your friends? In EQ you set Auto-run and off you go, your legs
    doing all the work while you type. That is an incredibly cool feature and makes the
    Interface seem just a tad bit less clunky. </small><br>
    <small>So there you've got it. The only real problems that &quot;I&quot; saw in the game.
    This game is much more than simply a game, it's an experience. To find yourself running
    maniacly through the forest screaming at the top of your lungs, er Keyboard, while being
    chased by a few blood hungry Orcs wanting to have you and your Halfling buddy for lunch is
    exhilarating to say the least. To be standing in front of Kaladim looking at the Giant
    Dwarven statue in front of their city is awe-inspiring at best. To find yourself driving
    down the street in your car and spotting someone that looks vaguely like an Ogre and
    wanting to drive them over is disconcerting by far. The best way for me to cap this off is
    to let Brad do the job with his thoughts about the game.......</small></p>
