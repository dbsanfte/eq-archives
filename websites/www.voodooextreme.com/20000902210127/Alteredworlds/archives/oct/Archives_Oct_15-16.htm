    <small>Mark Brockington had some words to say on the Developers corner about BG and the

    <blockquote>
      <font color="#e3cead"><p></font><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">It's
      about as non-linear as you can get and still have a cohesive story. The chapters are not
      physical constraints that you travel back and forth between. They are specific triggers
      that advance the main plot, occurring when a condition is fulfilled. When &quot;X&quot;
      destination is reached or &quot;Y&quot; object obtained, etc. The sub-plots are
      independent of the chapter events, and can be done at any time. Basically, if you wanted,
      you could probably visit 80% of the game's locations before you even triggered the end of
      chapter one. That doesn't mean you can &quot;jump&quot; to chapter five or six, but you
      CAN visit a lot of the areas in which they would take place (and do sub-plots there). The
      events that would trigger the actual chapters would not be available because you haven't
      set up the circumstances that would cause them to happen. Villain &quot;Y&quot; wouldn't
      be at &quot;X&quot; location yet, because you have not exposed &quot;W&quot; or found
      &quot;S.&quot; If you have to talk to Bob about Mary, you can't do it until you've heard
      about Mary. The main plot has a beginning and an end and certain things that must happen
      in-between(chapter cues) for you to get to that end. The game-world itself is largely wide
      open, and the emphasis you put on actually progressing the story is entirely up to you.</font></small></p>

    Info</a> </strong></font><small><a href="mailto:rbowmaster@shaw.wave.ca">- Bowmeister</a><br>
    The ever vigilante guys at <a href="http://www.vaultnetwork.com">VN</a> noticed this one.
    Greg Peterson of Interplay posted a very informative bit on The Backroom message board -
    lots of juicy info on Planescape:Torment, the newest rpg to use Bioware's Infinity engine.
    </small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"><small>There were a couple
      of questions about Planescape on the other board, so I am posting the answers here (since
      they do not directly affect Baldur's Gate)<br>
      <br>
      Planescape: Torment is being developed in-house at Black Isle Studios. Guido Henkel, best
      known for creating the Realms of Arkania series, is the senior producer. Chris Avellone is
      the lead designer. Also wokring directly or indirectly on the project are both Zeb Cook
      and Colin McComb ((the original co-creators of Planescape for TSR). The rest of the team
      has equally impressive credentials. Our first web site will be up in about a month. The
      game will take place in the AD&amp;D campaign setting of Planescape and will be
      significantly less 'traditional' than Baldur's Gate. It will be a much more mature, edgy,
      setting. The characters and monsters will be VERY high level, and there will be
      significant political forces and intrigue involved. It will be single-player only, because
      the game will be focused much more against internal character development (i.e. your
      actions shape the game) than external development (killing monsters and getting loot). <br>
      <br>
      You will play the role of an immortal character, who has lived for thousands of years, and
      experienced hundreds of 'lives'. The catch here is that every time he takes enough damage
      that would normally kill a mortal, he falls into a temporary coma (while he recorporates)
      and all his memories are wiped clean. When he awakes, he has no idea where he is, why he
      'died', who killed him, etc. Over time, he has created hundreds of friends, multitudes of
      enemies, has become an arch-mage, super-hero, master-thief, etc. Unfortunately, none of
      this helps if he can't remember any of it...<br>
      <br>
      The main game story is shaping up to feel more like Fallout2 in length versus Baldur's
      Gate - there will not be the same huge numbers of sub-quests, but there will be a greater
      degree of replayability because you can play the game so differently depending upon the
      personality you chose to embody (for example, if you want to be a bad ass, everyone will
      fear &amp; hate you -- if you want to be friendly, everyone will try to influence or
      control you) Planescape is NOT a setting for the wimpst. The game engine will be a
      modified version of the Infinity engine developed by our friends at Bioware. The first
      on-line previews are up in most of the online game zines - we are also featured in both
      Nov PC Gamer and CGW (and probably other magazines that I haven't received yet). Our
      advertising starts in December magazines. <br>
      <br>
      The game is due out Summer '99.</small></font></p>

      that I cannot respond to everyone individually, but that would take quite some time. I
      will be keeping up all applications. In the event we need more hosts, I will likely call
      on those who have sumitted applications. I am also accepting new applications all the

      any of us anything - except a technological soap-opera), and a serious technical dialog

      was -- they wanted more in graphics and state-of-the-art playability. Also, the current

      flexible piece of software in the universe. Terrain is made in the editor, object shapes
      are built in 3d max, and mesh models (npcs generally) are built in max, textured and
      animated in alias. so there's no reason why someone with the editor, those pieces of
      software (anybody got a spare sgi lying around?), a computer and lots and lots and lots of
      spare time couldn't make their own shock 2 levels. </font></small></p>

      plans to release the editor, as they own most of it (we just own the pieces we created for
      shock 2, which are huge, but the underlying editor code is theirs). I will ask them.
      However, I can tell you now that deathmatch is not a planned feature. This doesn't mean
      that this can't change, but we have other plans for multiplayer (insert evil laugh

      around multi-player: I think the Corp is a good idea, though my philosophy (for what it's
      worth) is to focus on what you do well. I think Unreal and Quake do deathmatch real, real
      well. I don't think they do content heavy, immersive, sci-fi horror RPG with incredible
      object depth and complexity well. The guns in Shock 2 are great, but they're not the focus
      of the game. Our multiplayer focuses on the real Shock 2 experience. If were were to spend
      a lot of time building deathmatch levels, that's that much less time the team can spend
      building single player and our brand of multiplayer. I think it's the right decision, but
      I'd be curious what people have to say. The only thing I beg them to remember is that
      there's only X amount of stuff in a game (though with Shock, X is a pretty big number).
      How do you want to divide that X up? </font></small></p>

    <small>Was over at Planet Unreal and noticed that Warren Spector (Producer of Dues Ex) had
    a few things to say on his new game. I agree with Warren in this case. I believe
    Multiplayer is simply in vogue right now. Don't get me wrong....MP will always be around

      2) You can allow players into the game with their characters, but with 0 experience points
      and no inventory. 3) You can allow players into the game with experienced characters, but
      no inventory. 4) Or you can allow them in with experienced characters and all of their
      inventory. You also have control over the control you allow other characters to have - for
      example, you might have the only ability to pause the game. If one of your characters
      starts to screw around, you pause the game and boot him. An interesting side note - you
      can boot the player, BUT keep the character. So say someone has been playing for a while
      and then gets out of hand. You can boot the player, but allow someone else to come in and
      role-play the character (so you don't have to start the game over, or create a new
      character). The morale: as the game leader you will have as much power as you want to
      manage things. As a player, be careful which games you join... </font></small><font color="#e3cead"></p>

      fingered wings were barbed at each joint's end with an iron claw. Clad in these dreadful

    <small>Looks like Games Domain has been hitting the crack pipe pretty hard lately and
    punching out some nice previews. This time it's The Lady, The Mage and The Knight. I love
    that name. See with my imagination I would have thought up some insane name like The one
    legged Halfling, The Constipated Mage, and The Nymphomaniac. Personally I like theirs
    better. Read the <a href="http://www.gamesdomain.com/gdreview/zones/previews/oct98/lmk.html">Preview</a>

      in development since 1996, originally coded in 8-bit. Since teaming up with their
      experienced German co-developer attic, Larian , a Belgian developer, have been reworking
      the game to more modern standards. Incorporated graphics include 16-bit high color
      (640x480 to 1024x768 resolutions) real-time light effects (without 3Dfx card), twilight
      effects for sunup and sundown, light reflections, items in water, colored mist (MMX) and
      32-bit internal color adjustment (MMX). The Larian team has also not skimped in the
      artificial intelligence department either. This is where LMK shines and some of the
      features which will probably blow us all away (or drive us crazy) involve the high level
      of interactivity such as characters dousing lights or hearths, eating, sleeping and
      uh...yeah...using the toilet (I cannot paint a clear image so don't ask!). </font></small></p>

      happen in 1999' (Tom Hall, Lead Designer). But Ion Storm has got grander plans for
      Anachronox than a couple of expansion packs. As soon as the game is released it appears
      work will be commencing on an on-line version, and if it's anything like the way this is
      shaping up to be, it's going to be pant-wettingly good. </font></small></p>

      Software was the Publisher. We're still going-on strong developing Wiz8 and JA2. No need

      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">on the future of Wizardry 8:
      Wizardry 8 is taking-shape very nicely. It's a beautiful game, and the level designs by
      'Egg' and Steve at Sir-Tech Canada are devious and created with RPG gamers in mind. The
      eye-candy factor is way up there. Could Wiz8 be the Hexen II and Heretic II killer title?
      Not an exact match, but the graphics, levels and monsters are certainly much better. </font></small><i></p>

    news</strong></a></font><a href="mailto:sacrates@voodooextreme.com"><small> - Sacrates</small></a><br>
    <small>It's been a while since we heard anything on the happenings of Revenant. My last
    peak was at E3 and a few small Previews since then but nothing really that makes me feel
    special just yet. However with that said, Rex Dickson of <a href="http://www.cinematix.com/">Cinematix</a> just spewed some goodness VN's way with
    these few fine words on a new revamped Revenant page. Check it:</small></p>
    <i><b><blockquote>
      <p align="left"></b></i><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"><small>on why
      Revenant is different: Revenant is not a traditional RPG in the style of the Ultima series
      or Might and Magic. Revenant is not a point and click action fest with no story. Rather,
      Revenant is more a blend of several genres all fused together into one. This is what sets
      us apart. We have dialog and plot like an adventure game. We have realtime combat that
      plays like a 3-D fighting game. We have tile based isometric artwork that seems pulled
      from the pages of a children's fairy tale book. Mix these elements together and you can
      begin to see the type of game Revenant is. </small></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"><small>on combat: Combat
      includes 4 basic modes. We have weapon based combat, hand to hand combat, bow combat, and
      stealth mode. Weapon mode features three basic attacks: a thrust, a swing, and a chop. As
      you gain experience you can learn variations off of these base attacks. These variations
      will eventually lead to chain attacks that link moves together in a multiple hit attack
      combination. In certain situations, an interactive move can be performed. Interactive
      moves include fatalities, throws, and power moves. These are not reserved for the player
      alone however. Expect monsters to pick you up by the head and throw you, punch you in the
      face and send you flying head over heels; even pick you up and powerbomb you. Did we just
      say pro-wrestling moves in an RPG? You're damn right we did. Hand to hand mode works much
      like weapon mode with the 3 basic attacks being punch, thrust kick, and jumping sidekick.
      Variations can be learned like the uppercuts and spin kicks. Interactives and combinations
      are also included for some serious martial arts combat. </small></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"><small>For those players
      who prefer bow combat, we have included a multitude of bows and crossbows to pick off
      enemies from afar. Finally there is stealth mode which enables you to sneak in and out of
      the shadows to sneak up on enemies and surprise them with assassination type moves. Don't
      expect to get away with it easily though, our monsters have some of the most wicked AI yet
      seen in an RPG. With hearing, sight, and path finding, monsters will often chase you
      through an entire level if you attempt to run away. To get a first hand look at Revenant's
      combat system, check out the <a href="http://www.cinematix.com/rev.avi" target="_new">demo
      movie</a> we have posted up.</small></font></p>

    <small>Ken Levine was over on Tetracorp's unofficial SS Board and had a few good words to
    say about System Shock. Check it out: </small></p>
    <b><i><blockquote>
      <p align="left"></i></b><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">on design
      philosophy around injuries affecting gameplay: Some very good points here, got me thinking
      (bad news for everyone...) All right, ready for some design philosophy spew? </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">1) Moderation is
      key. But also, I think it's important to give the player choices rather than handicaps.
      For instance...does he want to wear the armor that slows him down but protects him more or
      the armor that is thinner but keeps him spry. This way, if the player is slow, he's not
      just anxious to get to the point where he's not slow. He's made a choice and gaining a
      benefit from it. Good game design (i think) is generally about choosing between two things
      that both have good and bad. </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">2)re: moderation:
      somebody said he once heard that a great game aboard a space ship would have one bunk for
      every supposed crew member. The first thing I thought was: well, that's a lot of work. And
      a lof of repetition. And then I thought, there will be a few hard core types out there who
      will go out and count the beds and then be thrilled that the work was done to properly
      simulate this aspect of ship life. But I think most people will have an impression of
      &quot;hey, another crew quarters...yippee...&quot; </font></small></p>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Now this isn't to
      say that you shouldn't strive for the FEEL of this. Shock 2 has restrooms, plenty of crew
      quarters, security stations, mess halls, the whole nine yards. But our focus is gameplay.
      The space ship will feel lived in, that is job one from an environmental standpoint. But
      will it have one bed for every crew member? Well, you're just gonna have to count them for
      yourself (grin)...</font></small></p>
