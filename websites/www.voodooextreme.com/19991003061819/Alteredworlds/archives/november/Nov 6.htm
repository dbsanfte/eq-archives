    <small>Wicked...this has <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>been far too long</strong></font>
    in the coming. Origin's development team for Ultima Online has posted the first public
    draft of the proposed changes in the upcoming housing patch. From the looks of it, it's a
    winner, addressing most (if not all) of the issues that have been plaguing UO from a
    tent/vendor/house standpoint. Check the whole thing out <a href="http://update.owo.com/team.html">here</a>, and make sure you send feedback in - this
    one looks like a winner.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"><small>That brings us to
      vendors. We'd like to foster the use of shops, rather than roadside vendors. Shops are a
      more social experience, can provide more fictional atmosphere, and can be coupled with the
      lockdown feature to allow larger inventories for merchants. So we propose to not permit
      vendors outside of buildings anymore. Instead, the capability to have more than one vendor
      per building would be added. We would also add the ability for the owner of the building
      to allow vendors placed by others as well, so that players can create mini-malls or
      marketplaces which house multiple businesses. However, in order to ensure that vendors are
      used as shops, and not as banks, we will remove the ability to lock the front door of
      shops. </small><br>
      <br>
      <small>In other words, the building will be designated as &quot;public.&quot; This will
      allow those merchants who value the location of their current vendors to replace their
      tent with a building in the same location, and create a nice shop. Additional features,
      such as adding the ability to customize the shop sign to use the graphic for whatever shop
      type the owner designates, and for automatic advertising on bulletin boards, allows the
      shop to function better.</small></font></p>

    <small>With info pouring out faster than a <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>tourist in
    Tijuana running for the can</strong></font>, here's the lastest tidbits off the Baldur's
    Gate Developer's Corner. First, from Luke on Dual classing and experience points...</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">When you dual class
      it freezes your first class at the minimum experience for it's current level.<br>
      <br>
      So, if you play a fighter to 89000(level 7) and you dual class, you get set to the minimum
      for level 7 (64000). That means you could go and gain 25000 XP all over again, reaching
      level five as a mage in your second class. <br>
      <br>
      Your first class would be forever out of your reach though, as you need to get one level
      higher in your new class for the old one to reactivate, and the total XP cap would not
      allow that(you would need 90000XP to reach level 8 as a mage. this would be 154000 total
      between the two classes).</font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>Next, Luke looks at inter-party relations between &quot;good&quot; and
    &quot;evil&quot; chars, as well as what happens when you start screaming for help...</p>
    </small><blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"><strong>What happens when my
      kindly and forthright paladin whomps the crap out of my stupid hafling thief (Gumrot) for
      picking pockets on an old lady? Does my paladin become an enemy and trigger the rest of my
      party's NPC scripts to attack him? (I'm sure Gumrot would approve)</strong> <br>
      <br>
      If you have a paladin and a thief in the same party, the paladin will not automatically
      attack the thief for stealing (unless it's multiplayer and it's another PC :). If your
      thief is caught stealing too often, your party rep will drop. When this happens, the
      paladin will complain (as will other good-aligned characters). If it drops too low, good
      characters may leave. Some may attack you as well (because you are now evil). <br>
      <br>
      There are a number of reasons for your party to turn on other members, but the instance is
      rare and simple stealing won't trigger it. <br>
      <br>
      In any case, if a party member turns on another, the other party members stay out of it
      unless you direct them to help one side or another. It's your call as leader.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>In multiplayer, my hafling thief (Gumrot) wanders off screen into a trap, and some
      gnolls to boot, and yells for help. Can the other group members hear my pitiful cry? (even
      if the response is only laughter.) </strong><br>
      <br>
      The other PC members can &quot;hear&quot; your cry in the chat window. They can also see
      everything you can if they move their screen to your character. The screen is not
      permanently centered over any one character, it is free-scrolling because you might have
      control of NPC's or need to see off the edge of the screen.<br>
      <br>
      NPC's will not &quot;hear&quot; your cry automatically if they are out of visual range.
      You can run them over quick manually though. Once in range of hostiles they will attack
      (if you have assigned scripts) or you can control them as you will. I prefer the latter.</font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>And finally, Luke clears up some of the latest info on spell casting...</p>
    </small><blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">It won't tell you the target is
      too far away. If the target is outside of the range of the spell, the character will move
      until he is within range, and then cast the spell. If you don't like the direction he is
      going, you can stop him any time before the spell is cast and you won't lose it. <br>
      <br>
      As I said, if he has begun the casting process it will be lost if you interrupt him.</font></small></p>

    <small>Web stud Desslock has thrown up parts seven &amp; eight of his <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>bigger than the history of the world</strong></font> interview
    with Richard Garriott. Part seven is dealing with the controversial decision to nix the

      <font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"><em><p><small><strong>Desslock:</strong>
      Why did you decide to get rid of the party of companions in Ultima: Ascension? I think
      people were disappointed with the prospect that the 3D technology may have made it
      necessary to get rid of the party of companions.</em></p>
      <p><strong>Richard Garriott:</strong> People aren't in here playing the game every day,
      and I'm telling you, the reason why we decided upon a single character is that once you
      build a world that's this immersive, the companions became baggage, more than they became
      an aspect that made the experience fun. But you still meet your own companions, they still
      do things with you, they occasionally actually travel with you for short stints, but
      fundamentally you're on your own.</small></font></p>

      an RPG's greatest strength is sometimes its greatest weakness. All those stats and skills
      and points can sometimes be overwhelming. With EQ, there's a commitment to ease a new
      player into the game. Guild Masters will send you around on very simple quests at first,
      so you can learn the game controls, how to interact with NPCs and how to buy things. UO,
      in some cases, can make players feel like a child dumped into the heart of New York City;
      there's so much to do and see and no one helping you out that it's very easy to quickly
      become overwhelmed. We're also going to provide a nice manual to help people out.&quot; </font></small></p>

      is pretty cool - within the context of the game, we think that being called
      &quot;Avatar&quot; is perfect. In the game, you are The Avatar - which is both a personae
      and a title. We think that the status of the title is akin to that of our President. We
      don't call our President &quot;Bill, the President&quot; - we call him &quot;Mr.
      President&quot;. I hope that makes some sense.</font></small><i></p>

      planetary board is Phillip Ross. The reason Omni-Tek is the most powerful is due to their
