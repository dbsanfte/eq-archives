    <small>Continuing it's RPG coverage of the day OGR has slapped up a<a href="http://www.ogr.com/previews/elysium_1.phtml"> Preview </a>of Elysium that you should
    defenitely check in on. Ah, <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>another new RPG to add to the
    list of upcoming gems for us to cover at AW</strong></font>.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">We took a brief look
      at the infancy of Elysium in mid-1998, and although some things are certain to change when
      it decides what it wants to be when it grows up (it is not due until the end of 1999), it
      certainly is an intriguing design from the get-go. So what is Elysium, anyway? Cutter
      calls it &quot;a world beyond dreams,&quot; a concept that he fully differentiates from
      &quot;a dream world.&quot; So we are supposed to accept this world as real-but when does
      reality become fantasy? In our dreams. Elysium is an alternate universe that is reachable
      only when dreaming or during moments when your brain is in a particular, creative state.
      One of the ideas with which they're toying is that Elysium has been the inspiration for
      some of history's greatest thinkers, artists, and writers. These innovators have had
      adventures in Elysium, but they forget about them when they wake up. With this in mind,
      don't be surprised if you encounter characters such as Mona Lisa in the game, or come upon
      a background from a Rembrandt painting. In the first episode, for example, the characters
      find a stone circle and assume that it is Stonehenge. </font></small></p>

      <br>
      As for the cinematics.. well, I didn't want to.. but for you guys I went and had a look at
      the low res versions of the ending. (darn you all) The finals aren't in yet... in any
      case... they will be stunning... some of the animation is just breathtaking.. some of the
      effects are really incredible. I don't want to tell you how long it lasts tho.. seems like
      that gives too much away. It lasts -a few- minutes. Just to leave it open ended... :)

    <blockquote>
      <font color="#ffffff"><p></font><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">We
      continue to work on the patch - we're having a hard time fixing the Lo Pan/Dragon fight
      bug where people Save in the middle of the fight. The engine really doesn't handle Saving
      the game in staged fights like that. But we are working on a fix.</font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">I've gotten a lot of people

      Myst - the five year old adventure game. Also, I was not saying that it would look exactly
      like Myth, but it was just an example of an engine that was 3D and isometric.</font></small></p>

      have it hooked up with the copy protection that was only put on the European and UK
      builds. French and German patch versions will also be coming out close to the US version,

    <small>Delphine Software is currently working on an upcoming RPG by the name of Darkstone
    which looks very cool. Plus a damn cool sounding name also. So if your blow up doll <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>hasn't been providing you with enough loving lately</strong></font>

    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The game is fully
      3D, and supports most 3D accelerator cards via Direct3D; it sports a viewing system that
      is fully player-controlled for both orientation and zoom and is somewhat reminiscent of
      Dungeon Keeper. Beautifully detailed characters are done in a whimsical animé style, and
      there are eight of them to choose among, male and female from four castes: Warrior,
      Cleric, Rogue, and of course a Magic-User-one that looks disturbingly like Little Bo Peep.
      Also like Diablo, each new game uses a quest generator to randomly place treasure and
      quests (of which tens of thousands are possible) with over 30 levels per quest, and over
      80 types of monsters, including killer bees. </font></small></p>

    <small>Ken Levine was hitting the boards again. After playing the Thief demo I can
    honestly start looking forward to System Shock. Looking Glass is defenitely <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>someone to watch</strong></font>. First we have a talk on Cut

    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">We're firm believers in
      consistency, but our need for flashbacks, extended exposition and general depth of
      storyline requrired bigger guns in the cutscene department than halflife. The System Shock
      2 story is quite large. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The cutscenes are a combination
      of strictly in game, in engine, in engine rendered to avi and enhanced and a few, brief,
      3D studio type sequences. </font></small></p>

    <p><small>Here he is again talking about an object next to the gun in a recent screenshot.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">That would be a vial of a
      chemical compound. Chemical compounds have a very cool role in the game. Which I will
      reveal very soon. Think XCOM... </font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>Ah, a little engine goodness.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The Shock version of the engine
      is strictly a superset of the Thief engine. We have 16 bit color, colored lighting, larger
      spaces available via some cool lightmap tricks, etc. The AIs naturally can't see people in
      shadows (or more to the point, you can make them sensitive to that as much as you want.
      That said, Shock 2 is less a game about stealth and more a game about going into combat
      with the right tools on the battlefield of your choosing. What kind of ammo is the foe
      sensitive to? What condition is my weapon in? Should I use my powered armor that could run
      out juice in the middle of the battle or my less stoked (but more reliable) gear? Should I
      push my psi powers on this guy and risk overloading and blacking out? Shock is a game of
      choices. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">However, the shadows work for us

    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">We are finalizing
      all of the details on how exactly the game matching will work and what services we will

      of other organizations.<br>
      <br>
      The Gamespy logo is on the box. </font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left"><small>Next we have more Greg talking about pricing the game etc.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">There are two ways
      to make up for high development costs:<br>
      <br>
      1) Charge more per game.<br>
      2) Sell more games.<br>
      <br>
      We are taking the second track.<br>
      <br>
      Without going into all of the details behind managing development budgets, we have a
      pretty good handle on what we are spending and when, and for what features. The
      development of this game has taken a long time, however it is not 'over' budget. We will
      actually be making a slightly LOWER unit profit margin on Baldur's Gate, because of the
      added materials in the product build (big map, 5 CD's, etc). However we will more than
      make it up on volume.<br>
      <br>
      I don't think anyone is worried about the profitability of this game without having to
      charge extra for it. </font></small></p>

      something interesting?<br>
      <br>
      If you select guard/protect and click on a group of hostile creatures, your party members
      will actually do this! The reason this is interesting is that they will proceed to attack
      not only the hostiles ('cause that's what their scripts say), but also each other ('cause
      you've just told them to guard/protect the enemies).<br>
      <br>
      I was going to enter this as a bug, but then I sat back and thought about it. It's
      actually not a bug, really. It's actually what you'd expect them to do if you gave them
      conflicting order! <br>
      <br>

    <small>CGO has slapped up <a href="http://www.cdmag.com/Home/home.html?article=/articles/015/181/elysium_preview.html">some
    goods </a>on Cavedogs upcoming RPG entitled Elysium. The graphics look crispy critter to
    me. I think this <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>could be a killer game </strong></font>considering
    the guys making it are experienced CRPG developers. Thanks to Desslock's spunk shack for
    that.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">We took a brief look
      at the infancy of Elysium in mid-1998, and although some things are certain to change when
      it decides what it wants to be when it grows up (it is not due until the end of 1999), it
      certainly is an intriguing design from the get-go. So what is Elysium, anyway? Cutter
      calls it &quot;a world beyond dreams,&quot; a concept that he fully differentiates from
      &quot;a dream world.&quot; So we are supposed to accept this world as real-but when does
      reality become fantasy? In our dreams. Elysium is an alternate universe that is reachable
      only when dreaming or during moments when your brain is in a particular, creative state.
      One of the ideas with which they're toying is that Elysium has been the inspiration for
      some of history's greatest thinkers, artists, and writers. These innovators have had
      adventures in Elysium, but they forget about them when they wake up. With this in mind,
      don't be surprised if you encounter characters such as Mona Lisa in the game, or come upon
      a background from a Rembrandt painting. In the first episode, for example, the characters
      find a stone circle and assume that it is Stonehenge. </font></small></p>

      There is little to no visual quality improvement in the game between the Voodoo2 glide
      driver and the voodoo2 DirectX 6 driver, although the framerate on the Glide driver is
      higher. The RivaTNT Driver Displays more colors, giving a less &quot;dithered&quot; effect
      over the Voodoo Drivers, and also gives a much crisper, cleaner image.</font></small></p>

      <p><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style" size="2">IGN: In Drakan, the character
      can go indoors, run along the ground or fly high up in the air. Is this all handled within
      the same engine? If so, how is it being done?<br>
      </b>Patmore: Yes, the entire game is rendered using the same engine. Our tools allow us to
      essentially edit &quot;layers&quot; of geometry. By manipulating this geometry we can
      create incredibly organic indoor and outdoor environments. Some of the latter levels of
      the game are incredibly fantastic. Massive spiraling mountains, lava waterfalls, floating
      islands are just a few of the environments that the tools allow us to create. The ability
      to edit layers allows us to create geometry that is impossible in traditional landscape
      engines.</font><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"> </font></p>

      most in combat. Hit a key to draw Cyrus' blade, and then a few simple keystrokes let you
      try some daring moves. The real-time sword fighting gives the game a true swashbuckling
      feel as you parry the attacks of numerous opponents and skewer your enemies. </font></small></p>
