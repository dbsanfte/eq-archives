    <small>It's been a while, but Stephen Nichols was back on the all new Middle Earth Dev
    Board and<font color="#FFFFFF"><strong> had a few sparkly things to say</strong></font> on
    permanent death in ME.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Permanent death relies on a few
      design ideas that still need to be realized: </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">1) The player power curve needs
      to be realistic. We can't have single players that can take out 10 opponents without a
      scratch. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">2) There needs to be an enforced
      waiting period before you gain the ability to permanently kill another player. We're
      currently thinking about 1 month's worth of play time for the character before enabling
      the murdering option. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">3) To kill a player, you must
      have disabled ALL opponents. After ALL opponents are disabled (or have fled), you can take
      out the unconscious folks. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">4) The civilized game world must
      react negatively<br>
      when you murder someone. Shopkeepers should call guards, sherrifs should want your head.
      Of course, if you leave the area in which you have murdered, you'll be out of harms way.
      Guards should be believeable... not teleporting instant killers. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">5) Pulling the plug during a
      battle should have NO effect. The AI system will take over such characters and allow them
      to continue fighting. Of course, if you log back in while the battle is in progress, you
      should be able to resume. This should allow your buddies to guard your AI controlled body
      in the event of a network failure. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">All of these options should help
      to make permanent death feasible. </font></small></p>

    <small>The boys were at it again on the boards. No rest for them that's for sure. Anyway,<font color="#FFFFFF"><strong> they did a little tag team action</strong></font> today. Let's
    hit the first one by Ray who was responding to a possible December 5th release date.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Says who? (we're
      hoping it would be sooner than that, but we still want to fix every last little bug first,
      so this damn game will be perfect :)</font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left"><small>Here's Luke on why there is no Waterdeep.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">All the reasons
      stated by the regulars on the board, and more.<br>
      <br>
      Waterdeep is a fan favorite to be sure, and lots of people would love to take a walk
      through it's streets. Unfortunatley, those streets are exceptionally well known. <br>
      <br>
      Here's a little insight into what we must consider when choosing a location. <br>
      <br>
      All TSR liscensed products must fit the setting and the events that are currently occuring
      in the &quot;world.&quot; Continuity is vital, and any events we create in an actual TSR
      world must not conflict or damage plots &quot;currently&quot; occuring in other products. <br>
      <br>
      Basically, the more &quot;interesting&quot; a current setting, the less likely we would go
      there. If there are plots and intrigues already on the go, any events we construct must
      not effect them. You COULD go to waterdeep, but you couldn't do anything of consequence
      while there. The Sword Coast and Baldur's Gate are both still very much a frontier, so we
      can shake the tree a little harder there than elsewhere.<br>
      <br>
      As well, the more things that are detailed currently, the more we have to try and
      impliment as acurately as possible. This does take away from what we can create ourselves.<br>
      <br>
      Besides...Waterdeep would have to be the WHOLE game to do it right. It's freaky huge.</font></small></p>

    <p align="left"><small>Here's Ben and a big list of joy for you to read.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Ok, I am going to
      answer a whole bunch of questions here, sorry I don't have time to E-mail everyone. <br>
      <br>
      1) BG needs 16 bit graphics support to be able to play. So unless the machine has a 2 meg
      card you are out of luck. This includes laptops or any other system that runs a Microsoft
      OS.<br>
      <br>
      2) I am not going to post the buglist, it gets misinterpreted and it opens up too many
      cans of worms. It is getting very small, we are fixing faster than bugs are found. It is
      getting very nitpicky (sp) which is a very good sign.<br>
      <br>
      3) When will it be done. VERY soon. The finalization of the manual, localized versions and
      the credits are are topics of conversation as opposed to &quot;hmm, how are we going to
      implement this&quot; or&quot; boy is &quot;x&quot; broken&quot; . All of these things
      should be a good sign of where we are.<br>
      <br>
      4)Update your page Ben..Sheesh. Well, I'd love to, and I will soon, after BG ships. Then,
      sleep, maybe even a vacation :).<br>
      <br>
      5)Will BG ship multi-language simultaniously? Pretty close. We have worked very hard to
      make this as easy as possible. With the added input and help from Diarmid (Interplay UK
      guy who came down for 3 weeks and a very cool guy) this should be possible.<br>
      <br>
      6)We use C++, Lightwave, Max2, WCS, Delphi, and a whole bunch of other software to create
      the game. All editors and the engine were created in-house by our programmers (kick ass
      group of death machines).<br>
      <br>
      7) Yes we are doing MDK2, and my page will have a section for it, after BG ships. There is
      a press release that gives a general overview.<br>
      <br>
      8) Yes I have a list of features for BG2. We print out all the suggestions, they are
      currently on my desk as I compile a new features list for BG2.<br>
      <br>
      9)What is left. Some gameplay bugs, some multiplayer bugs, Zip ,ship, and put it in a box
      :) Refer to #3 for when.<br>
      <br>
      10) I would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone involved with this project.
      Everyone has really worked hard, and the end is near. This includes all of you reading
      this. Without your support, this would have been impossible. Anyway, back to work, talk to
      you all again soon.</font></small></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Redguard is the
      first title in the newly formed The Elder Scrolls Adventures series. You'll find a living
      3D world, exciting swordplay, and rich storytelling. Redguard truly stands out as a
      refreshing tonic in a market saturated with repetitive knock-offs and tired cliches.
      Featuring dozens of fully animated real-time 3D characters, Redguard lets you interact
      with everyone you meet on the populated island of Stros M'Kai. Using the third person
      perspective, the camera system allows for dynamic panning of the action. </font></small></p>

      everybody! Myself and a bunch of TSR designers will be posting in the future. We won't be

    <small>Me thinks the subject speakest for itself. And I must say, this thing looks
    extremely nice. They have got this baby streamlined now. It's starting to look as <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>smooth as an Aerodynamic Camel</strong></font>. Anyway, the beta
    isn't officially up on the pages yet but you can go to Beta Bites and <a href="http://www.betabites.com">eat it up</a>. Also now that you've got this nifty new ICQ
    to toy around with you can also grab a copy of Magic Spell for ICQ to go along with that.
    You can grab<a href="http://www.voodooextreme.com/Alteredworlds/MagicSpell.exe"> Magic
    Spell </a>from our Worldy Events on the right hand side of the page ya blind bastard.
    Thanks to&nbsp; Lockup for that nifty info.</small></p>

    <small>The subject describes it so eloquently, Not RPG but....in all probability the game
    of the year! No kidding here, this game is so hot that Grandma Jones could cook her
    favorite stew on it. Graphically not the game of the year but still holds it's own. Half
    Life simply <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>changed my entire perception of what and how
    games could be</strong></font>. We're talking it affected me more than a full cavity body
    search. (not that i've ever had one before of course) Anyway my point is that Gamecenter
    just dished out a well done<a href="http://www.gamecenter.com/Peeks/Halflife/"> Preview of
