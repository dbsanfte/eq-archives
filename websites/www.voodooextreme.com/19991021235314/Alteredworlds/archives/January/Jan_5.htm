      with the decision we made. I think that if anything, we demonstrated our desire to do
      whatever possible to get Baldur's Gate into the hands of the fans as quickly as possible.
      A lot of people worked over their Christmas vacations and on weekends to make this happen.
      It would have been too easy to look around on December 18th and say &quot;oh well - see
      everyone on January 6th&quot;. Instead, we fought the entire system to make at least some
      fans happy for Christmas.</font></small></p>

      Scratched CDs. They suck. If you get a scratched CD, return your product for a
      replacement. Of course, if you can play the game with the scratched CD, it is your choice.
      The CD holder we used with Baldur's Gate we have also used with other games and haven't
      had many problems previously. For future multi-disk games, we will be doing something
      else. Some people have made some good suggestions for alternatives, like shipping CDs in
      3-ring binder plastic sheets with the manual in a binder, etc. (similar to Falcon 4.0). </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">2) Multiplayer/Gamespy that
      doesn't work. We are looking at ALL of the support issues related to the game. Our first
      priority is to resolve hardware conflicts / driver issues that are preventing people from
      installing the game. Then we are looking at in-game issues that are causing problems for
      some systems. Next, we are looking at multiplayer issues. Finally, we are looking at
      in-game bugs and design recommendations. This is not to say that NO ONE is working on
      multiplayer until we get driver conflicts resolved, just that these are viewed to be the
      priority issues. Multiplayer and Gamespy work on many systems by the way, just not on all.

      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">3) Crashes are NOT the same for
      everyone. There has not been a SINGLE duplicatable (is that a word?) crash bug found yet
      in this game. Most people are installing and playing the game without problems. Our major
      area of problems so far has been that Baldur's Gate uses some aspects of DirectX that no
      other game has used before. It is absolutely imperative that you have the proper drivers
      and that your hardware supports DirectX. We are working through the issues on a system by
      system basis. As we get more information, we are constantly updating our troubleshooting
      guide in the <a href="http://www.interplay.com/support/bgate/fixes.html">Customer Service
      Database</a>. While on chat last night, I personally helped 'fix' two systems that people
      were having problems with - neither of which had anything to do with the game. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Please read the troubleshooting
      guide in the CS Database if you are one of the minority of people that are having trouble.
      In priority of order check to see: </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">a) That you have a video and
      sound card that is fully DirectX compatible. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">b) That you have the most current
      drivers for the card. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">c) That you are not running
      excessive TSRs on your system (Terminate and Stay Resident programs). These are things
      like Norton Anti-Virus and Memory Manager programs. If you hit Ctrl-Alt-Delete once in
      Windows, and you see anything other than &quot;Explorer&quot; and &quot;Systray&quot; you
      are running other TSRs that may cause problems. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">d) Finally, if you HAD been
      running the game fine, but suddenly had a quirky crash or something, check to make sure
      your disk cache hasn't gotten corrupted (especially if you have a fragmented disk drive or
      didn't have much extra space on your drive). Delete the cache file and when you restart
      the game, the cache will be reloaded from the CD's. </font></small></p>

    <small>Alright, this must be <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>official EQ day at Altered
    Worlds</strong></font>. I have a feeling news is going to really start kicking in on EQ
    soon so sit back and relax because we'll be there to cover it. Here's Brad talking about
    how good the Beta testers are doing right now.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style"><small>Let me clarify a few
      things. <br>
      <br>
      The majority of testers are doing just fine, and we are deluged with feedback and bug
      reports. From my perspective, the beta is going even better than we'd hoped, and we are
      very pleased. <br>
      <br>
      There are all sorts of people in phase 3, and this is according to plan. While .5, 1, and
      2 were more carefully screened, with phase 3 we were purposely more lenient. We want
      'exploiters' in the game, to help find all sorts of problems. They are quite welcome. <br>
      The people we don't want are those who exploit and both don't report it and continue doing
      it. <br>
      <br>
      They're in the game, but there aren't that many, and we are banning them as quickly as we
      can (and publically, for that matter -- we broadcast bannings in-game, not to be mean
      spirited, but to make it clear that we are serious about the matter). <br>
      <br>
      We have the spine, trust me. I've a mailbox full of emails from those banned and all their
      friends, guildmates, etc., begging to be let back in the game. I rarely respond.</small></font></p>

    <small>PC.IGN have kicked in another update to their<a href="http://pc.ign.com/previews/2252.html"> ongoing Everquest Preview</a>. We're getting
    close to Beta 4 gang with all this info starting to really come in like this. A lot of
    anticipation here. <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Believe me when I say it's totally worth
    it</strong></font>. This time the chimps over there are talking about the party.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">A good party is one with good
      balance and it should include brawny warrior types as well as a few brainy spellcasters.
      It's always good to have at least one 'tank' character -- someone who can dish out damage
      as well as withstand a good bit of punishment. Obviously Warriors fall under this
      category, but some other good choices for tanks include Monks, Paladins, Rangers, and
      Shadow Knights. Rangers also prove to be handy as they can track specific monsters. </font></small></p>

    <small>Abashi has been the man lately. He was on the boards yet again today and had a few
    more things to say. First is this post on Bug Boards for beta 3 players. <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>We're becoming quite the EQ newsboard lately aren't we</strong></font>?
    Not only do we give a swift kick to the Bill Clinton with RPG news, but we dish out the
    largest helping of EQ newsbites around.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Unfortunatly we can't add phase 3
      people to the bug board. That will basicially limit people to using /feedback and
      discussing issues in game. The Guides usually have a pretty good idea what bugs are in the
      game, but in general, unless it is severely unbalancing or a bug that you know did not
      exist until very recently, just /bug it. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The exception to this is MOB
      pathing issues (creature stuck in wall, behind zone plane, on rock, in wrong zone, etc).
      We need to know about those right away for the next few weeks.</font></small></p>

    <small>Just noticed this little piece over at CON who got it from Norrath Roleplay. This
    is defenitely an interesting concept which should turn out very cool if it works. It's
    pretty tough to Roleplay when your a rookie screaming bloody murder with <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>a couple Wasp drones snapping at your ass</strong></font>. Not
    that I would know...ahem. </small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">It seems EverQuest roleplayers
      may get their own server afterall.<br>
      Norrath Roleplay, an on-line community of roleplayers, is preparing to<br>
      make claim to one server in the name of roleplayers everywhere. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">While 989 Studios have made no
      official endorsement, the grass- roots<br>
      movement continues to swell. With the recent premiere of their new<br>
      website at <a href="http://www.norrathrp.com/" target="_new">www.norrathrp.com</a> the
      group has seen their membership grow<br>
      to well over 200 roleplayers, including many prominent guilds. &quot;And<br>
      that number climbs every day,&quot; according to Norrath Roleplay staffer,<br>
      Sauleth. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">&quot;At this rate, we'll have
      400 people by Phase Four of the beta test,&quot;<br>
      claims Jerris, another staffer. &quot;And by the mass release, there should<br>
      be well over 1,000 roleplayers involved.&quot; </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">&quot;We just want to make
      Norrath as immersive an environment as possible,&quot;<br>
      says Kha&#146;Dorak, another of the staffers. &quot;Our definition of roleplaying<br>
      is pretty liberal. We just want Norrath to smell like a High Fantasy<br>
      world. We want to have fun.&quot; </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">In addition to flooding one
      server with roleplayers, the group is taking<br>
      several steps to foster a sense of community and immersiveness in the<br>
      world of Norrath. Their efforts include player-run quests and several<br>
      in-character taverns. </font></small></p>

    <small>After yesterday I can only imagine what today is going to be like. There was a ton
    of good info floating around the net no doubt. Ahem, your probably wondering what I am
    doing here when I have EQ on my HD right now. <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Well, a man's
    gotta breathe don't he</strong></font>?! Anyway, this is only a short break and then i'm
    back in action. The thing is, when I got hold of the auto patch program from the boys at
    989 I never realized how robust their servers are. When I say robust, I mean the fat pipe
    of love. Let me put it this way, with my cable modem I downloaded roughly 250 megs in oh
    let's see here....2 hours!!!! If that isn't robust then my mother is Aunt Jomima. For
    those that are wondering, and I know your wondering, there is absolutely NO lag in this
    game. Of course this is coming from someone who just dloaded 250 megs in 2 hours also. So
    I put it to the test on my 33.6 connect and guess what? No lag. believe this or not, but
    the Mofo plays faster for me than Baldur's Gate does in single player!</small></p>

      tremendous level of publicity the game generated for so long prior to release, do you
      think it will live up to gamers' expectations? </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Ray Muzyka:</b> I hope so. We've
      never tried to &quot;hype&quot; the game, but merely tried to listen to the fans, and to
      answer their questions on the newsgroups and the BG message board, so that they could
      participate in the design process. We tried to make a CRPG that we would like to play
      ourselves, one that recreated (on the computer) the feel of the great AD&amp;D pen and
      paper modules of the past.</font></small></p>

    <blockquote>

      do this. For instance, if you have a guild you could appoint a wizard to rule over all the
      magi, and a Warrior to rule over all the warriors, and perhaps a Paladin to rule over the
      hybrids. But the guild name that shows would not show the division, and any officer could

      <div class="newstext"><p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Okay, it
      has become <b>blatantly</b> obvious that all too many testers are engaging in rampant
      exploitation. To give you some idea of what may be exploitation:</font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">1) If a mob gives way more loot
      and/or XP than others of the same level, and you keep killing it over and over, it's
      exploitation. To give you an idea of what &quot;too good&quot; is, normal 30th level mobs
      should not be dropping more than 3 to 5 platinum worth of loot, and no single mob should
      move your XP bar more than a few pixels. This also goes for any quests, if an 8th level
      character can complete in a few minutes a quest that pays 5+ platinum it is a bug.</font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">2) If there is a way to kill a
      mob where it cannot possibly fight back (stuck in walls/behind doors, it keeps running in
      circles/back and forth, it is in the water and you're on a bridge, etc.), it's
      exploitation.</font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">3) If you can cast defensive
      spells in a certain order and they &quot;stack&quot;, when they wouldn't if cast in
      another order, it is exploitation. Defensive spells that are different levels in the same
      series should *not* stack, if they do it is a bug, and the same goes for many
      &quot;Enhancement&quot; buffs. If they have similar names, similar effects, and come at
      different levels, they probably shouldn't stack.</font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">4) Anything that just seems
      &quot;Too easy&quot; *may* be exploitation. Confirm it, report it with /bug, and move on.
      Just as a benchmark, *no* solo character (casters with pets are not solo for this
      definition) should be able to consistently beat anything higher than a &quot;blue&quot;
      mob, and you should not be able to beat *any* yellow or higher mob singlehanded regardless
      of method. This isn't my definition, it is 989's. Any combination of tactics that can
      allow you to do so anyway is imbalanced, and needs to be reported.</font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Everyone please remember that
      this is BETA. You're supposed to be helping to balance the game. Exploitation leads the
      Dev Team to mistaken conclusions about the current state of balance, they believe that
      certain classes may be much more powerful than they really are. This can have *disastrous*
      results for the real balance when the exploits are fixed.</font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Saying &quot;If it isn't supposed
      to work that way they shouldn't have it in there&quot; is no excuse. It's a Beta, we all
      know there are bugs, we're not supposed to exploit them, simply report them so they can be
      fixed. If it is a easily duplicated and imbalancing bug, or if you see it being heavily
      abused, you may want to /petition it as *well* as /bug it. Remember, the goal is to make a
      better game, not have the &quot;best&quot; character in Beta. They're all getting wiped
      eventually, anyway.</font></small></p>
