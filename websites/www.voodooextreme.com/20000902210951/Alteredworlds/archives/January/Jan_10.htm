    <small>Here is a bit of an update on my continuing adventures in EQ after my marathon this
    morning of another 5 hours. First of all I have switched from a Wizard to a Cleric a few
    days ago and have built myself up to level 4. Today was also a milestone for me in that it
    was my first opportunity to venture out of the Greater Faydark into the Steamfront
    Mountains. So far my whole experience has been in the dark and gloomy forests of the
    Elves, but today I ventured out into the light of day and noticed one thing....it's
    bright! After looking at Trees, trees, and more trees with a whole lot of fog tossed in,
    this was an amazing experience. <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Not to mention the most
    beautifull sunset I have seen on a PC</strong></font>. I also noticed some very cool, yet
    tough new monsters. Let me emphasize that the character animations are simply amazing and
    must be seen. Screenshots don't do it justice. I don't know how to emphasize this even
    more, this is no UO here kids! The funny thing is that I haven't had a chance to play this
    with any sound yet! I have been playing in absolute silence since I got it. They aren't
    putting in the new sound system until Beta 4.</small></p>

    <small>There is a lot of talk running around right now about what people like more, single
    player RPG's or massive multiplayers? I would love to be &quot;old school&quot; on this
    issue and say that I like Single player more but I can't. As Baldur's gate proves, it's
    got the massive size and return to the old days of RPGing, yet is still limited to what
    can be done. Don't get me wrong, I love BG and the single player RPG experience BUT, more
    personal opinion leads to massive multiplayer. Why with all of those bugs and all those
    kids running around spamming your screen with trash talk would I like this type of game?
    Because in this case it actually does promote role playing the way it was meant...personal
    interaction. I don't care how advanced our AI's get over the next few years there is
    nothing that can beat the depth of a human mind and it's unpredictability. Take Billy and
    I for example...<font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>we could boggle the mind of even the most
    intelligent Psychiatrist</strong></font>. Anyway, I think you'll understand as soon as you
    get to play Everquest for the first time. It has all the potential and even more than UO
    had but this time it capitalizes on it. With that said, it has been a 3 day marathon for
    me with this game so far and it doesn't look to end any time soon. I'll see you guys soon
    in a whole new world.</small><br>

    <small>It is always good to get these little morsels on the boards. <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Abashi
    was back </strong></font>to it answering a few questions. This first one is on how long
    Everquest will last and how much is there to see.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">How about a world so full of
      depth that realisticly no one will ever experience the full diversity EQ has to offer? </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">So you spend 60 days p-time
      building up a monk to the highest states that a character can reach? What then you ask?
      You still haven't fought and killed every creature in the game, you probably still haven't
      seen nor survived through to the bottom of a number of dungeons. By then, Kunark and
      Velious will probably be up in which case you definatly haven't. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">You haven't even seen the
      majority of magic items in the game, much less worn/wielded them. You haven't gone on even
      10% of the quests, as many will be race, class, and deity based. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">By the time you reach 50th level
      there will be 20x more stuff you haven't done than the stuff you have.</font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>Here he is again talking about the scarcity of Artifacts in the game.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">There will indeed be Artifacts of
      Great Power (funny, that's what they are called) and they will have a history behind them.
      But don't ever expect to own one, as they will be exceedingly few and far between. I
      shudder to the the odds of one person ever having one, let alone more than one.</font></small></p>

    <small>The boys over at EQSS have sauced up a bit on the <a href="http://eqss.stratics.com/classes_brd.htm">Bard in Everquest</a>. This seems to be a
    fairly cool class when you see them in the game. Another one is the Magician also <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>with their cool Elementals.</strong></font> But there are so many

    <small>Sith was back to work after a brief hiatus with a bunch of good morsels from the
    programmers on the boards. We're getting close to <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>this jewel
    of a game</strong></font>. First is a bit on where the hell the Christmas Present they
    promised is.</small></p>
    <i><blockquote>
      <p></i><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">We are working on something..
      unfortunately it got delayed (due to no one person, but you may blame me if you like ;)...
      I'm hoping to have something new and exciting within a couple of weeks to share. :)</font></small><i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p></i><small>Here's a bit on Digital vs Midi sounds.</small><i></p>
    </i><blockquote>
      <i><p></i><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Completely depends on the
      source material and how much time our Audio Engineers have. If the source audio was
      composed with MIDI and recorded into digital, then it wouldn't be too huge a deal to have
      a choice. However, I was under the impression that the music is being recorded using live
      performances, which would make it difficult to provide MIDI tracks... Don't hold me to
      that though - I'm not the authority on the source material.</font></small><i></p>
      </i>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>On the Clipping Plane and Terraign.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">There is a clipping plane for the
      terrain (which includes mountains), but it is more distant than the clipping plane for
      buildings and other objects, and separately adjustable.</font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>And to top it off here are a few new screenshots from the game. First is thie <a href="http://www.writingtosell.com/ultima/Yew_gondola.jpg">Gondola</a> in the game. This
    one gets me nervous for my frame rate but looks great. Next is the <a href="http://www.writingtosell.com/ultima/u9map.jpg">Map</a>. And then we have this<a href="http://www.writingtosell.com/ultima/riversedge.jpg"> one</a> and this <a href="http://www.writingtosell.com/ultima/riversedge02.jpg">one</a>.</small></p>

    and the Spawn</strong></font></a> <a href="mailto:sacrates@voodooextreme.com"><small>-
    Sacrates</small></a><br>
    <small>Here is a popular question with these types of games..<font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>.the
    all important spawn</strong></font>. It's also been a while since we got any news for
    Middle Earth so this is always good to see. This first one is on whether the spawn will
    handle like The Realm's.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">We may use the
      spawning dungeon system in some isolated sub-dungeon areas. For instance, Moria is a HUGE
      place that is filled with many mini-dungeons. Some of those mini-dungeons may spawn. In
      the event that they do and you logout, the spawn would be held. You would reappear in the
      same spawned dungeon if you log back in. Expect the use of spawning dungeons to be rare,
      if at all.</font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left"><small>And here's a small bit on becoming an Elf and looking like one too.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Once you get the
      ability to play an Elf, you will need to create a new elven character. That elven
      character will look like an elf, with specific facial features and clothing options. </font></small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left"><a name="Darkstone cometh"><font color="#C1C1FF" face="Arial"><strong>Darkstone
    cometh</strong></font></a> <a href="mailto:sacrates@voodooextreme.com"><small>- Sacrates</small></a><br>
    <small>Now here is a game that is starting to make me all warm and fuzzy without the use
    of Interns or exotic drugs. Gamecenter is <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>dishing out the
    goods </strong></font>on this upcoming biscuit with this <a href="http://www.gamecenter.com/Peeks/Darkstone/">Preview</a>. Graphically it looks like
    it could surely give Diablo 2 a run for it's mega millions.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">With sci-fi
      action/adventure and racing firmly under its belt, Delphine is now trying its hand at
      fantasy role-playing in Dark Stone. Based on our early look, it certainly appears up to
      the challenge. Prepare to lead two of your own characters on a Herculean quest to collect
      seven magic crystals, which empower a mystical orb, and finally conquer one very scary
      dragon, Drakk. In the process, you'll journey through 32 daunting dungeons created by the
      game's Quest Generator, which assures no two games are ever alike. </font></small></p>
