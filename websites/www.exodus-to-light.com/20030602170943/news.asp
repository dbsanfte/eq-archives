  those of you who could manage to get to Jagged pine and to the Brellis temple 
  we had a grand time drinking, drinking, killing <a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=9339" target="_blank">Jaarl 
  the Oracle</a> (He was blocking our view..) and a wedding somewhere in there. 
  The ceremony took a while to get started and the Bride, Tanaquil was late. People 
  were passing out booze, fireworks, spin bottles and generally getting trashed. 
  After realizing that a GM would not show we started the touching (sniff...sniff) 
  services then all hell broke lose. Sars started by immediately slaying Jaarl 
  as a sacrifice for his new wife. Then drinking, duels, and Spasster trying to 
  hump people while in wolf form. A disturbing visual, I might add. Here <a href="captures/82402Sars/index.htm">is 
  a link to the images</a>. While your at it if you haven't registered into the
