  </span><span class="OrangeBold14">The Oath of Exodus to Light</span></font></strong></p>
<p>I will live by a code of conduct so that no evil act shall happen by my hand, 
  I will protect those within my power and help the weak wherever I can. I will 
  not harm the defenseless or through my actions allow a defenseless person to 
  be harmed. I will strive to help my brethren at all times and will accept with 
  gratitude that which they give in return.</p>
<p>(Code of Exodus to Light)</p>
<p><br>
  1. Respect at all times. This should be self-explanatory! You represent the 
  guild, remember that by your name is the &lt;Exodus to Light&gt; tag and 
  all who you come in contact with will see this.</p>
<p>2. No begging! Period. Do not beg within the guild or outside the guild. If 
  you need assistance then ask for it, but do not continue to pester folks over 
  and over again. And we do not tolerate beggars, BUT remember the first Code 
  when dealing with beggars!</p>
<p>3. No evil acts. This means never intentionally do something to harm or hurt 
  another player. See the first Code.</p>
<p>4. It&#8217;s required that each of you act in a mature manner. Know limits 
  and boundaries, it's simple.</p>
<p>5. Whenever possible play with your fellow guildmates. However, don&#8217;t 
  get mad if none are available when you are. It is also important that we do 
  play with others as well in order to meet new folks!! Also, remember that helping 
  out guildmates on quests and exploring new areas is fun and rewarding!</p>
<p>6. If a guildmate needs help and if you have the available time, never hesitate 
  to lend a hand.</p>
<p>7. Use the message boards OFTEN. They are the lifeblood of our guild, and your 
  strongest voice among us. Participation in the boards is required to remaining 
  a member in good standing</p>
<p> 8.Use of /anon is prohibited as it hides your guild tag. /role is an acceptable 
  alternative.</p>
<p>9. No applicant can be in a guild and be accepted in guild.</p>
<p>10. Current guild members should not apply to other guilds while in ETL. Being 
  caught results in guild removal for that character.</p>
<p>11. Have FUN!</p>
<p>(Guild chat Rules)</p>
<p>&middot; No excessive or inappropriate profanity.<br>
  &middot; NO derogatory or slanderous words or ideas.<br>
  &middot; No discussions on religion, lifestyles, or politics.<br>
  &middot; Respect your family with your words and comments.</p>
<p><br>
  (Inappropriate conduct)</p>
<p>If a ETL Member acts dishonorably there are actions that will be taken. All 
  reports should be submitted to the first available officer on-line. Please do 
  yourself a favor and log events that take place or even take screenshots if 
  all else fails. I realize these can be edited, but an investigation will be 
  conducted. To log events type /log (should say Log *ON * or Log *OFF * depending) 
  and your text will be recorded and can be retrieved from your Everquest directory. 
  When a ETL Memberhas been reported as acting dishonorably then an investigation 
  will take place. If it is determined that inappropriate conduct took place then 
  the following actions will result:</p>
<p>You are required to make apologies to anyone who you may have dishonored or 
  harmed by your actions. If you took something from them you will be required 
  to return the item or an appropriate amount of money</p>
<p><br>
  If you do not make restitution to the person(s) who was wronged you will be 
  asked to do one of two things: A) Leave the guild with honor by either making 
  the announcement in guild chat with an officer online and aware of the what 
  you are doing, or posting on the message board that you are leaving. B) Leave 
  the guild dishonorably by simply removing yourself from the guild with no word 
  to anyone.<br>
  If your actions were severe enough and/or you show no remorse an immediate removal 
  from the guild can result.</p>
<p></p>
<p>(Structure of Exodus to Light)</p>
<p>Guild Leader: Grak<br>
  Guild Council:<br>
  Aubryanna<br>
  Grix<br>
  Kasjule<br>
  Lokaout<br>
  Sars<br>
  Syphedius</p>
<p>The leader/Council of the guild is responsible for the guild and its dealings. 
  The guild leader can make final decisions when all the officers can not agree 
  or when there is a major change needed to structure or promotions. It is the 
  guild leader's duty to serve the guild to the best of his/her ability and not 
  to show bias. The guild leader/co leader does not have to abandon the fun of 
  her game and can choose to delegate responsibilities to his/her officers.</p>
<p>It is an officer's responsibility to serve the guild to the best of their abilities. 
  This does not mean an officer must abandon the fun of the game in order to attend 
  to every single request from guild members. Officers are role models, mediators, 
  and decision-makers.</p>
<p><br>

<p><br>
  Our goal, is to see our guild and it's members flourish both in and out of Norrath. 
  The strongest tool we have for success is the message board, and all members 
  are required to use the boards regularly. One might think that guild chat is 
  our strongest tool, but most of the time it isn't, and for several reasons. 
</p>
<p>1)Often people are busy in an intense group, etc. and either don't notice someone 
  asking for help in guild chat, or don't have time at that moment to help them. 
  (Be it by joining them somewhere, or simply answering a question)</p>
<p>2)The boards are the best resource for questing, tradeskills, zone/mob info, 
  class info--anything. Think of how much time it would take for one person to 
  precisely and accurately explain over and over to people how to do the Rallic 
  Pack Quest and explain where to hunt down the grimling runner on his path in 
  the Tenebrous Mountains etc. etc.</p>
<p>On this same note, remember that if someone refers you to a web page to help 
  you, be thankful they helped you! </p>
<p>3)The boards are the best way to get 'pick-up' help on a rare spawn. If people 
  know you are going to be hunting XX_MoB on XX day, they might not sign up for 
  the Fear raid on the same day, they can also chose to hunt in zones that are 
  nearby. Some guildies will even change RL plans to help out.<br>
