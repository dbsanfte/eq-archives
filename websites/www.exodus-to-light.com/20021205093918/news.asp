EQ Instant Messenger</span> <br>
<span class="whiteBold12">There is a cool new feature that I'm afraid won't succeed since Verant/SOE is intent on charging for everything thing cool. It's called EQIM and it's actually something that will allow you to talk to friends at work in and out of EQ. I guess Sony links IRC to the server and they think they now own chat.

Keal Raid w/Medieval</span> <br>
<span class="whiteBold12">The raid went very well except I got killed when invis dropped on the way to the Castle camp spot. We had some great loot. Frostbringer, Cloak of the Maelstrom, some thurg armor pieces. all and all a great time. 

We didn't even have an enchanter the whole night. So it can be done! Thanks to modrods and a mana pumpin necro we kept everyone alive most the time. 

Thanks Medieval! Let's do it again soon. </span><br>

  <img src="captures/82402Sars/thumbnails/EQ000054.jpg" width="100" height="80" align="left">To 
  those of you who could manage to get to Jagged pine and to the Brellis temple 
  we had a grand time drinking, drinking, killing <a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=9339" target="_blank">Jaarl 
  the Oracle</a> (He was blocking our view..) and a wedding somewhere in there. 
  The ceremony took a while to get started and the Bride, Tanaquil was late. People 
  were passing out booze, fireworks, spin bottles and generally getting trashed. 
  After realizing that a GM would not show we started the touching (sniff...sniff) 
  services then all hell broke lose. Sars started by immediately slaying Jaarl 
  as a sacrifice for his new wife. Then drinking, duels, and Spasster trying to 
  hump people while in wolf form. A disturbing visual, I might add. Here <a href="captures/82402Sars/index.htm">is 
  a link to the images</a>. While your at it if you haven't registered into the
