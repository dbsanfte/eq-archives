Head to West Karana. Look for "a wandering spirit". It looks exactly like a wisp. It is probably best to get a tracker to help you with this. However, if you don't have one, you can stand at -500, -5300 and the spirit will wander by you. However, this can take up to 30 minutes. Once spotted, run up to him and hail him at close range to get him to stop moving.
<p>
You say, <b>'Hail a wandering spirit'</b>
<p>
a wandering spirit stops and flashes brightly for a moment. It seems to be regarding you with interest.
<p>
Give the "small gem" to the wandering spirit.
<p>
a wandering spirit says 'Oh, it is you, shaman! Good! You must hurry before it's too late. Go now to the Mountains they call Rathe and find them! They need your help quickly! They will know you when they see you and instruct you on how you can help, but you must hurry!'<br>
Your faction standing with True Spirit got better.<br>
You gain experience!!
<p>
Head to the Rathe Mountains. You'll find Tabien the Goodly (level 32) at location +6300, +1550.
<p>
You say, <b>'Hail Tabien the Goodly'</b>
<p>
Tabien the Goodly says 'Oh thank Marr you are here. I was beginning to think I would be abandoned in my time of need. I have a [task] for you to complete in the name of my patron Mithaniel Marr.
<p>
You say, <b>'What task?'</b>
<p>
Tabien the Goodly display his shield that must once have been shining and regal but is now scoured in cuts, dents, and chipped paint. He says, 'This shield is known as Marr's Promise. It is a sacred relic that was actually used by one of Mithaniel's angels on the Plane of Valor. Its value to our church is immeasurable and I have been charged with the protection of it. However, a patriarch of the false god, Bertoxxulous, is after my shield and me. He must be stopped! Please, destroy him and bring me proof of his death.'
<p>
Next, find Glaron the Wicked (level 32) at location +2900, -1900.
<p>
You say, <b>'Hail Glaron the Wicked'</b>
<p>
Glaron the Wicked says 'Are you the one they sent to help our cause? I should have known they would send a green witch doctor to serve Bertoxxulous and myself. Very well, you will have to suffice. I have a [task] you must fulfill if you wish to know the blessing of my god and impress your masters.'
<p>
You say, <b>'What task?'</b>
<p>
Glaron the Wicked brandishes a long, wicked-looking bone dagger and there is a horrid, diseased stench as soon as he unsheathes it. He draws another blade, shorter and wider than the first, of blackened bone with a larger than normal hilt, obviously for defense. He says, 'This festering blade is called Woe, and this scorched one is called Envy. They were created on the Plane of Decay by Bertoxxulous' own hands. He has judged me worthy of the protection of such holy relics. However, there is one in these very mountains who seeks to destroy these relics. End this idiot follower of Marr's life and bring me proof.'
<p>
Both of these men have lost sight of their true cause and instead spend all their energy trying to spite the other. Kill both and take the three items - Envy, Woe, and Marr's Promise. Give them all to the wandering spirit back in West Karana.
<p>
a wandering spirit says 'You are close to passing the test, keep up the good work.<br>
a wandering spirit says 'You are close to passing the test, keep up the good work.<br>
a wandering spirit says 'It is unfortunate that it came to this, but nothing else was to be done. Both paragons had lost sight of their virtures to protect the items given to them. The mere protection of these material belongings was not as important to Mithaniel Marr or Bertoxulous as it was that they act with righteousness in their minds and purpose in their hearts. You saw this and acted accordingly. For that, we will reward you with the three treasures made into one to ward off the falsehood of possession, the [Shield of Falsehood]. You have walked the path and now, as your final test, we must set you along one [last path].'<br>
Your faction standing with True Spirit got better.<br>
You gain experience!!
<p>
You say, <b>'What shield of falsehood?'</b>
<p>
a wandering spirit says 'Yes, I have taken Marr's Promise along with Woe and Envy and fashioned them together to create the Shield of Falsehood. Wield this in defense of possession and the weakness that comes with hoarding treasure instead of using it to accomplish your goals. May it serve you well.'
<p>
You recieve the shield, which is as follows:
<p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>
You say, <b>'What last path?'</b>
<p>
a wandering spirit says 'You have trusted us along the paths we have set before you. You have been known to be patient and await the right moment. And now, you have learned the wisdom to act in our best interest. However, one last path awaits, to determine if you have the ability to act out what must be done. There are many troubles about the world we try to rub out but none is more serious than the curse on what the wasichu call the Emerald Jungle. Go there and find one of our spirits. Show them the gem you have been given and follow the path they set you on.
