<table width=90%><tr><td>

You must now kill Lord Ghiosk in the City of Mist. You will need about 3 groups of level 55 or equivalent. Check out this <a href="http://www.eqatlas.com/kunark/cityofmistmap.html">map</a> from EQ Atlas. Lord Ghiosk is at #1. To get into the castle, you will need a rogue to picklock the door open. Ghiosk drops three books, all in the language of Lizardman.
<p>
Book 1
<p>
<i>Neh Ashiir's disappearance will always be cloaked in mystery. We of Torsis have a saying that goes "Neh's chances". We all know this is used to define an innumerable variable but not many know of its relation to the event in the early years of our fair city. For as many people as there were in Torsis there were that many theories regarding Neh Ashiir's disappearance. Others say there were political tensions between the queen and her lord, so much so that she had to leave to escape death. And for good measure a few pointed to the stars and said that people from beyond the sky took her. One thing all agreed upon however is that the relationship between the royal couple was decaying. Political scrutinizers noted small personal habits between the two that implied a separation of intimacy during their public appearances. Many even tie the highly publicized Crusade of Kirn into the disappearance of Neh as Kirn left the city only a few weeks before. It is recorded in many texts that the visage of Rak' Ashiir reflected his despair over his wife's vanishing although it is a well known fact that it was mostly an act played by the King to keep up his illusion of nobility. Perhaps one day we will find the truth but at this point it would mean little to the public.</i>
<p>
Book 2 - Keeper of the House's Log
<p>
<i>1. New wash basins must be acquired. Servent Hujin will see the Quartermaster and place the order tomorrow.<br>
2. The chandelier in the main hall was finally repaired tonight. Payment must be sent to the contract holder tomorrow.<br>
3. Advisor Snith ordered that I personally find and acquire 3 dozen finely made vials. What they are for he would not explain and was very firm that I do this as quickly as possible. Best to make haste to fulfill the order, rumours abound of the Advisor's mastery of the arcane.<br>
4. We've been low on candles for the last week. There is no explanation for the shortage of wax. Perhaps I should send a Palace Reaver escort with the next pick up crew. The craftsman may have the intelligence to figure the symbolism.<br>
5. It is imperative that we return the High Scale's Icon to the church as discretely as possible. If Rak Ashiir returns from his journey early and discovers it was found in the royal bedroom it may prove disastrous. I cannot decide whether to place it ourselves with the help of our Black Guard, or to approach one of our contacts in the church. The less people that know of this the better. It might be prudent to ..remove.. the servant who found it within the sheets.</i>
<p>
Book 3
<p>
<i>Throughout the history of the High Scale it was common for the knights to practice complete celibacy. It wasn't until the controversial Kirn was given the hallowed title that contact between the sexes became tolerated. While Kirn wasn't the mightiest of the High Scales he was able to achieve many great victories in the name of our Lord of Fear. One being the battle known as the Bone Rending when Kirn lost his fabled whip, Thriaxis' Tail, as was still able to defeat scores of his enemies using his hands only. Before this battle many believed Kirn could not fulfil his duties as a leader and patriot for the people. However Kirn's might and his lecture on the use of females in religious crusade and duty convinced the public that celibacy had its place in divinity but non-celibacy also had a place and value within the church. A shrine depicting Kirn among many women was constructed in remembrance of his controversial reign although his corpse was never brought back for burial as it was lost far across the ocean among distant brothers on faith.</i>
<p>
Give the three books to an a "Spirit Sentinel" at the bottom of a pond in the Emerald Jungle, locacated at +3685, -640.
<p>
Spirit Sentinel says 'Hmmm, it appears the queen's disappearance wasn't as random as we thought. It also looks as if this High Scale were having some sort of affair with Neh. We have little but speculation at this point, so making it known to Nak'Ashiir would do nothing. Perhaps finding the resting place of the High Scale will show us more of what really happened. We suspect the icon mentioned in this log could now be located in the city's old temple. Find the icon and bring it to Kirn, wherever he is. Tell us what you learn afterwards.<br>
Your faction standing with True Spirit got better.
