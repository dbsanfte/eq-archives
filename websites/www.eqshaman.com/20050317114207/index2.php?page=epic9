 <center><h2>Part 9 - High Scale Kirn</h2></center><br><br>For the next encounter you will need about 3 groups of level 60's. Proceed to The Hole, near Paineel. High Scale Kirn is located in the tower beyond the city. Check out this <a href='http://www.eqatlas.com/holemap.html'>map</a> from EQ Atlas. Kirn is #3. You might also want to try the maps at <a href='http://www.eqmaps.com/maplist.php3'>EQ Maps</a>. Kirn's respawn time is four hours. <br>As far as getting to Kirn, it should take about 2 to 4 hours. 11 mobs after the zone in, there is a dropoff you must jump down to progress. Once you jump off, you can not get back up. <br><br>Work your way through the city; the exit is a long winding tunnel. Eventually you will come to an open area with the tower off in the distance. The open area has 2 spawns - a rock golem and elemental. Kill those, move up. You have 6 minutes. The open area faces the tower and dips down, flattening in the bottom before rising again towards the tower. In this area before the tower you will come across a few roamers: a rat and several rock golems/elementals. <br><br>Your destination is ahead. Work your way to the base of the tower. In front of the castle are two spawns - revenant/wanderers. Now you have a choice. <br><br>1) Invisibility versus Undead - The Keeper of the Tomb in the left hand courtyard of the revenant tower will eat 2-3 groups alive if you aggro him. The good news is that Invisibility versus Undead works in the tower (even though some of the revenants will scowl at you, they will not attack). Go through the gate, run through the middle main doors of the tower and to the back where a single door opens to stairs leading upward. Follow this up a couple flights to Kirn himself, then drop invisibility in his room. The disadvantage to this method is that it can be messy if a couple of raid memebers have invisibility drop on them and die. Make SURE everybody knows before hand to let people die if they get attacked - just drag the corpses up and rez them once you are situated.<br><br>2) Kill your way through (be wary of the Keeper). Pull to the flat to prevent continuously fighting the 6 minute respawns at the top. This may be tough as you attract all of the roamers from the Master Yael tunnel. If you have been tearing through the mobs previously, it should be no problem progressing and moving up the tower. However, if you are not killing very fast you should probably not pull the inside of the tower for one or two rotations. Split up the spawn from this area first. Next, wait until the two revenants at the doorway spawn and then kill them. You then have 6 minutes to kill around 3 revenants in the first room of the tower. The trick here is to move inside. Do not try to pull a great portion of the tower to the outside; the respawn rate and number of mobs is likely to be too high. Work your way up to Kirn. <br><br>Once you get to High Scale Kirn, kill the three revanants in his aggro range. Since Kirn is indifferent you should not be using area effect spells of any kind. Give Kirn the icon. <br><br>High Scale Kirn looks down at the icon in his hands for a long moment before speaking. 'Why did you bring me this? Are you here to accuse me of the queen's death?' High Scale Kirn chuckles venomously and continues, 'I am High Scale and beyond your petty laws. However, I wish the truth to be known. On my hand is a ring. If you can take it from me, show it to the queen and she will remember. However, I will not give up the ring easily. Defend yourself!'<br>Your faction standing with True Spirit got better.<br>You gain party experience!! <br><br>Kirn is initially non-KoS, but will attack you the instant you hand him the Icon, so the above conversation will fly by. Kill him. He drops: <br><br><br>Engraved Ring<br>MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM NO DROP<br>CHA: +5<br>WT: 0.2<br>Class: ALL<br>Race: ALL <br>The ring identifies as "Promise Ring of Neh`Ashiir". <br><br>(Thanks to Valantor and Forthyr for providing some information on this encounter.) <br><br><br><b><font size=3><a href='index2.php?page=epic8'>Previous</a> - <a href='index2.php?page=epic10'>Next</a> - <a href='index2.php?page=epic'>Index</a></font></b><br><br><br><br><br><br></center><br><u>Comments/Feedback:</u><br><br><i><b>Tormidon - BB</b> says:</i><br><br>Hey I was wondering what kind of raiding force is needed to get to High Scale Kirn and to take him down<br><br><br><i><b>bazyli- tm</b> says:</i><br><br>what kinda raiding forceis neede to kill this guy

We went in with 9 people, average level of 63 and it was serious overkill.  He went down in less than a minute.  There was one mob we aggroed on our way in who was far tougher than Kirn (a ratling guard or something like that), but other than him, it was a piece of cake.  A single group should be able to roll in there and take him down.<br><br><br><i><b>Tollidon</b> says:</i><br><br>66 bard, shammy, and 64 sk took him<br><br><br><i><b>Anonymous</b> says:</i><br><br>Is there still a faction problem with this step?<br><br><br><form action='rate.php' method='post' name='rate'>
