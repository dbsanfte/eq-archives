 <center><h2>Great Exp in Paludal Caverns</h2><br><br>The Paludal Caverns are simply amazing exp, unmatched anywhere in the game. As such, you should want to go here as early as possible.<br><br>At lower levels, you need to enter from <a href='zones.php?zone=shadeweaver'>Shadeweavers Thicket</a> and stay on that side of the zone. The further in you get, the tougher the mobs. You can solo here quite well, but duoing is really the best thing you could do.<br><br><br>Once your high enough, or when you get a group (often at the bandit camp) you will want to leave the low level side and head to the higher level side accessed from the <a href='zones.php?zone=shadowhaven'>ShadowHaven</a>. Don't try and traverse the zone yourself if your lacking confidence, getting to the other side is very tricky at the best of times, and its much safer and not all that much longer just to gate and take the PoK books to enter from the ShadowHaven.<br><br><br>When you get a bit higher, you will quite likely be asked to a bandit group. This is NOT the fastest exp, its quite a lot slower than other mobs in the zone. HOWEVER: Although the exp is amazing, nothing in PC apart from the bandits drop any loot worth mentioning. So bandits might be a good choice, as otherwise you will burn through levels incredibly fast without making money, resulting in a disaster in purchasing spells.<br><br>Although you entered this zone at level 9, you really shouldnt be expecting to come out permanently until around 24! Although it is still possible to get exp at 24 and beyond, I wouldnt reccomend it as it really starts to slow down about then, and with your new spells you are powerful enough to take bigger game!<br><br><br><br></center>I cannot connect to the database because: Can't create a new thread (errno 11); if you are not out of available memory, you can consult the manual for a possible OS-dependent bug
