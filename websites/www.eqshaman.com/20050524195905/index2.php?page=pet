 <center><h2>Using your pet</h2><br><br>Unlike most other pet classes Shamans have to come to terms with pets mid way through their career. We do not depend on our pets, they just make life alot easier and more fun. <br><br>Unlike other pet classes our pet is far more fragile and we must look after it. The most important lesson is to make sure you dont use your pet to tank for you. <br><br>In dungeons i will usually be with a full group and will almost always have my pet to taunt, mainly because the fights should be relatively short and the pets can regen alot quicker than you can. <br><br>Buffs: <br><br>First thing shamans do is buff the pet like mad. Whilst this may extend its life by a few more rounds, its not a replacement for defensive skills the pet lacks. Your pet will usually be approximately 10 or more levels lower than the mobs you will be hunting. I generally do not buff my pet other than buff his attack speed. <br><br>In certain situations i will buff the pet, particularly in dungeons where there isnt alot of room and there are likely to be several mobs attacking the pet at a time. Evaluate if you need to buff your pet or not, not wasting mana on buffing you dont need will reduce your downtime. <br><br>Devotion: <br><br>Whist its touching that the pet will attack any mob that agros on you in many situations its not desireable to have your pet attack the mob from the outset, particularly if you are pulling a mob or kiting it. <br><br>The command /pet guard here will command the pet to stand at the spot. <br><br>For example, i see a Hill Giant in West Commonlands and decide to take it out. I command the pet to no taunt and to guard the spot and go out and tag the giant. <br><br>I dot it and run it around for a while to ensure the giant is nice and agro on me. I then run past the spot where i left my pet and order it to attack the giant. <br><br>By this stage the giant has lost between a quarter and half its hit points and isnt interested in the pet. I can run around in circles with the giant following me whilst the pet is chewing on its behind. <br>Occassionally the giant will be distracted by the pet and turn on it. Stop and reapply dots and maybe even a DD and it will come running after you again. When its low on hit points just turn around reduce its attack speed and melee it until death. This example is typical of outdoor shaman fighting and you can apply it to almost any mob where you have room to run. <br><br>Agro: <br><br>Its an art form comming to grips with how EQ mobs interact with players, their pets and which target they consider to be the target to attack or persue. Whist some mobs have been coded to ignore pets, pets are generally considered to be players in terms of how aggressive they become towards them. <br><br>Whilst our pets are relatively low level they hit fast and double attack aswell (they never duel wield). What they will do is hit more often than you will, this in itself will raise the pet on the mobs agro list. Ask any ranger why mobs agro on them when a taunting warrior which is outdamaging them cant keep the mob off the ranger. Speed of damage is more cruicial than the damage itself. <br><br>Luckily the no taunt pet command now finally works and shamans also have the ability to stay high on a mobs agro list with the usage of dots which naturally damage the mob every tick. <br><br>Unlike any other pet class, Shamans are the only ones that can tank better than their pet. Its in our best interest to keep mobs off the pets. Our pets are expensive to cast mana wise and should be considered a long term dot rather than a protective device, although they are an excellent life saver in time of disaster. Dont be afraid to leave your pet to be devoured to buy yourself some time to zone out. <br><br>Pathing Problems: <br><br>All dungeons have the problems with pathing bugs and quirks. Your pet will follow these paths in an attempt to get to your position in the quickest time. This often goes bad, very bad very fast. Pets can and do wander off in dungeons. You need to keep a careful eye on your pet. If you are camping a room then use the /pet guard here command so the pet will stay in one spot and not move around too much. After a fight the pet will return to that spot and the chances of it wandering are much reduced. <br><br>In dungeons i almost always leave the /pet taunt function on. Some times the only advance warning you have of impending disaster is when you get the message that your pet is taunting when your group is sitting down and recovering from a fight. Its important you inform your group when a pet is missing in action. <br><br>If you notice your pet is gone and you havent seen it taunt anything then immediately cast invisibility on yourself straight away, this will destroy the pet where it is. The /pet get lost command will only work if its in range. <br><br>If it is taunting then be prepared to retreat or evac. Make sure the group is informed, they should have alot of experience with other pet classes which all share the same problem. <br><br>In many outdoor areas close to walls there are no pathing lines which will cause the pet to wander off, avoid fighting or travelling close to zone walls with a pet. <br><br>Pet Problems: <br><br>Apart from the pathing problems another problem you have to be careful of is that the pet is erratic in its choice of target to attack. Classes that root or mez can get a tad irrate with pet classes when pets like to attack a target which everyone else wants to ignore. <br><br>Make sure you are in control of your pet. Dont be afraid to tell it to back off and attack the group target. Dont be shy with hitting those keys, sometimes it takes a dozen commands before the pet will switch to the desired target in the heat of a large battle. <br><br>If its becoming a nuisance then at times you have to tell it to get lost if you cant control it. <br><br>When enemy enchanters are around use the /pet who leader command as pets have almost a non-existant resistance to magic and are easy prey for enemy charms. <br><br>Pets are viable targets for your and your parties area effect spells, area effect DD and rain spells are not recommended when pets are around. <br><br>Commands: <br><br>/pet attack<br>/pet guard me<br>/pet guard here<br>/pet as you were<br>/pet back off<br>/pet follow me<br>/pet health report<br>/pet who leader<br>/pet sit down<br>/pet stand up<br>/pet taunt<br>/pet no taunt<br>/pet get lost <br><br>Hitting F1 will toggle between targetting yourself and your pet. Simply hit F1 twice to target your pet quickly if clicking on it is difficult.<br><br><br><br><br></center><br><u>Comments/Feedback:</u><br><br><i><b>Anonymous</b> says:</i><br><br>/Agree Ragan, i also use pet as tank. It sthe best way to go, kiting can be done but w/o snare it can be dangerous as well if not careful..use pet as tank and keep him buffed and get some mage pet toys and your golden.<br><br><br><i><b>Flogg Lheggs-TP server</b> says:</i><br><br>I disagree with your comment that our pets dont duel wield.  I often give my pet a Gnollhide Lariat with a stun proc. as well as a mage summoned blade or Hand of X with a fire proc.  During the battle , I will get a message that the mob was stunned by an irresistable force.. A moment later, I will get a message that the mob was burned and see the flash. My weapon has no proc. so I must assume that both proc. came from pet weapons. This started happening after level 29.<br><br><br><i><b>Anonymous</b> says:</i><br><br>I agree with Ragan about how to use pet, but no matter how fun soloing is, its much safer and simpler to just find a group.  But if you must solo you should have an uber slow and haste.<br><br><br><i><b>Kinedorf on Stromm</b> says:</i><br><br>I think this is a rather old guide. Shaman pets to dual wield when you give them weapons. Weapons that proc will do so if the pet is high enough level.<br><br><br><i><b>Benedorf on Tribunal</b> says:</i><br><br>Shaman pets *ONLY* dual wield if handed weapons.  Never hand pet a 2HS or 2HB weapon.  Even rusted weapons work.  Our pet when parsed truly dual wields and depending on buffs does frequently bite/kick/bash<br><br><br><i><b>Ougabouga</b> says:</i><br><br>Pet Discipline - This is an AA ability which gives you a new pet command called /pet hold.  Once a pet is given the command to hold it will not attack until told to. Is very useful when pulling caster mobs that like to nuke you when your running back to your pet.<br><br><br><i><b>Anonymous</b> says:</i><br><br>Thank you for the info. It was been a great help. 

<br><br><br><i><b>Hildar</b> says:</i><br><br>The Shaman pet is a true dual wielding knife fighter.  Get a couple top end summoned blades, a muzzle and collar, str agi dex buffs and you got one freaking nasty DOT going on.  Yes the Shaman pet is a DOT and should be used as such.  With taunt off, sic on target after tank draws agro, and the mob will drop fast.<br><br><br><i><b>Ragan</b> says:</i><br><br>I use my pet as a tank all the time. Pull mob w/ slow and sic pet on it. Root mob, dot as needed. If ya keep regen on pet it holds up very well. Just a lil advice for those who may enjoy a lil solo time. <br><br><br><i><b>Nibot</b> says:</i><br><br>Pet will not attack a mezzed MOB. So mezzing classes do not need worry.<br><br><br><i><b>Anonymous</b> says:</i><br><br>you can also give pet lore items and some no drops, I gave mine the rapier from the pirate in Firiona Vie even though it is lore and no drop. (i play on cazic thule)<br><br><br><i><b>Anonymous</b> says:</i><br><br>One item overlooked here is pet pulling.  There are cases where a pet can single-pull mobs that shammy would get adds on.  But to make it work you need the Pet Discipline AA so that you can use pet hold.  Have guard at your location then send pet forward to attack mob..then issue pet hold...pet will return and bring mob with it.  If you dont have pet hold...you wil have hard time getting pet away from mob since each hit will reagro pet.<br><br><br><i><b>lightazurik</b> says:</i><br><br>u mean that shammy pets can actually hold wepons and use them rather than just biting them?? i always thought only a mge,chanter,and necros pets could use wepons. well just goes to show that i really havent been playing long. one more thing, why the hell does it always cost sooo much to cast a pet spell and almost always fizzles when u have KEI. i mean i always cast and it fizzles, but when i cast it after dying i am always able to do it without any fizzling or problem.<br><br><br><i><b>lightazurik</b> says:</i><br><br>u mean that shammy pets can actually hold wepons and use them rather than just biting them?? i always thought only a mge,chanter,and necros pets could use wepons. well just goes to show that i really havent been playing long. one more thing, why the hell does it always cost sooo much to cast a pet spell and almost always fizzles when u have KEI. i mean i always cast and it fizzles, but when i cast it after dying i am always able to do it without any fizzling or problem.<br><br><br><i><b>Metoo</b> says:</i><br><br>I play a Beastlord and a shaman, and yes, you should always give those pets weapons...Best way, as stated earlier is to have a mage cast some weapons and armor for your pet...Or buy it in the bazaar...Rusty weapons work nicely as well...not sure at what level pets start to dual weld, but in the beginning just one weapon works...then use two....My Bstlords Warder can quad...Nice little dot there...*grin*
<br><br><br><i><b>Slowo</b> says:</i><br><br>Yes, if you dont give your shaman pet two weapons at the same time, he wont dual weild.
The level 67 pet still doesnt dual weild, so if you never gave your pet weapons, youre fucked cuz you missed half of its dps for the whole game.<br><br><br><i><b>takkat povar</b> says:</i><br><br>my pet tanks all the time for me keep regen and speed on  him plus HOS and you dont h ave to heal  him   much  if at all plus  yes they can duel wield  u just need to give them the toys for it to work<br><br><br><i><b>Feerles</b> says:</i><br><br>I use my pet to pull a lot of times when I am soloing.. I have him attack the prey and then as soon as he hits it I back him off bringing the prey back to me, then together we kill it
<br><br><br><i><b>kithacat 45 shaman ,veeshan</b> says:</i><br><br>Ya i slow pull snare pet attack ( make shure pet has temp toys & wepons & u have tmep..) & thats how i solo i have bear form up & cai rdy kei i get alot of exp i kill in DL its great exp i am going to go kill yetis in DL or some where gho the f away dad, now ok well all i gota go fucking dad is a A$$hole ya ya ya i know i swore he ais fucker...<br><br><br><i><b>DONTBESTUPID</b> says:</i><br><br>ok just dont be stupid here SHAMAN PETS CAN DUAL WEILD! It does not matter about when you give the pet their weapons one and then the other and wow he holds 2 weapons.  <br><br><br><i><b>Bob Boberson</b> says:</i><br><br>My name is Bob!!<br><br><br><i><b>Bob Boberson</b> says:</i><br><br>My name is Bob!!<br><br><br><form action='rate.php' method='post' name='rate'>
