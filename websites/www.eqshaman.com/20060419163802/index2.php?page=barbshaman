 <center><h2>Complete Barbarian Shaman Guide</h2><br><br><br>Barbarian Shaman Guide<br>by <a href='mailto:HeHeHeGS@hehe.com'>Canine Incarnate</a> of Mithaniel Marr<br><br>I have noticed that shaman seem to be getting the shaft on-line when it comes to the information available to them on sights like everlore and other specific web sights. Don’t believe me? Just check out all the information on all the mage classes (especially necros). Now I HOPE this is because you are all having to much fun playing to give us what you do know, and sense the servers are down today for an update I figured I had the time to put in my 2 cents. So I decided to sit down and "pen" up all that I happen to know about shaman for you all. This is what I consider the definitive guide to shaman. Ok as for the format I will give multiple ideas for all the levels all the way through 50, and combined with all the lower lev guides I have read (and MOST seem to stop around lev 20's) your life as a shaman is pretty easy. Here is where I have to make my disclaimer, This guide is for BARBARIAN SHAMAN ONLY, all you ogres and trolls I am sorry but I just don’t know your areas. <br><br> Lev 1 - 10 <br><br>                Ok the first thing I have to say is " DONT BUY ANYTHING BUT SPELLS AND FOOD!" ok ok ok and I guess the occasional Back pack but at 6gp they will have to wait till about lev 4. The key to being a good shaman is to have ALL of your spells so you can fit into any party or solo as you wish, to do so you need to save every copper. "What about armor" you ask? Well at a very low lev you start killing polar bear cubs and low and behold they occasionally drop PB SKINS now this is important because you can turn that skin into the lady in McTagerts Kilts for a FREE yes FREE piece of patchwork armor and some exp. Now hunting at lev 1 - 4 is pretty basic, just kill the stuff near the front ramp to Halas, those guards sure do come in handy eh? Also when you have to run to the guards STOP when you hear then yell at the Mobs running any further is detrimental to your health. 2ndly one of the GREATEST spells you get at lev 1 is INNER FIRE! This spell is not only a buff but it also heals, as a matter of fact it is mana: HP most efficient till like lev 9. Ok so you are lev 4 and have a few pieces of armor and a hand full of your spells, what to do now that you have started roaming around the mountains of ever frost? Go to the lady in the warriors’ guild and get the quest to protect the pass. This is a simple quest to go collect IceGoblin necklaces (you should have seen some by now) and put them in the box she conveniently gives you. This quest is good for some exp and food or a torch, either way you are killing them anyway. Ok so you have her quest and you know about the PB skin quest, where to go, well at lev 4 or 5 you are about ready to take your first trip past Bandi McLish, the lone guard on the pass to the tundra (shout for direction). Once out there you can start hunting the ice goblin scouts and wolfs, also grab any large spiders that happen to be passing by. If you feel like this is a bit too dangerous for you then I suggest one more lev at the intersection on the mountain side of Bandi. There is a LOT of mobs pathing through there and you should have bought a Backpack to hold all that loot in by now. Ok so you are on the tundra, my advice is to keep a SHARP eye out for passing orc troopers, they are MEAN at your lev so far, but ignore the mammoths passing by they want to fight you about as much as you want to tangle with them. The exp from wolfs / goblins / spiders should start weaning out about lev 7 or 8 this is the time when I suggest a party for the first time. Look for a party of people less then lev 10 that are hunting troopers / polar bears / leopards. This type of party can easily get you to level 10. What ever you do don’t party with any one that is more then 2 levs above you at these low levs. Exp wise this is HIGHLY unadvisable (so at 8 the limit is 10 at 10 it is 12) and don’t forget to keep killing those goblins, they are a breeze at your lev but you can do the necklace quest as often as you want. Also the polar bears you are getting exp for still are dropping more of the skins for armor, and exp, and hey free exp is free exp. You can start doing the wrath orc wristband quest now also. All you need to do is collect 2 Wrath bands off orc troopers and turn them into the same lady that you have been giving the skins to, this is great exp at lev 8 - 12. The people that don’t do these quests are going to be significantly behind you in lev when you reach lev 10 if you started the same time and play the same amount. SAFETY NOTE "Avoid the south wall at all costs, people claim to get great exp there but from all personal experience it is a death trap.  Also avoid Black Burrow, that place has trains that will kill lev 20's again the exp: death ratio is WAY too high for anyone looking for good exp."<br><br> Lev 10 - 14<br><br>                Ok lev 10 is a rather important level for shaman as far as I am concerned. Here is what would be the BEST position possible as far as I figure, you have rawhide chest and legs from the wrath band quest and you have Patch on the rest of you from the skin quest. HOPEFULLY you will have enough cash to buy all your lev 14 spells by now, if not all then at least the ones you want to use. Also this is when you can safely make your first run to the outcast shaman merchant. He is a lone man hiding behind a fallen pillar on the first ruins you come across if going from Bandi or Snowflake to Megins tower, (FYI all of these places are easily found if you ooc in everfrost.) He is the man that you need to see for all of your poison and disease DOT spells, his name is Bearjumper. Ok if you don’t have the cash to buy all your spells from halas then get as many as possible, stick around for a while to get the cash if you have to but get them at all costs and bank them, we are about to travel. Ok at lev 9 you get what is both a bane and a boon to shaman Spirit of the Wolf, from here on out known as SOW. Why a Boon (good)? Well you are the youngest traveler in norrath, at 9 you can now get anywhere you want, as only casters can catch you. Why a Bane (Bad)? "Can I get a SOW?" "I could use a SOW?" "Can you spare a SOW?" "Shaman can cast SOW right?" "Getting a corpse can I get a SOW?" "Got mana for a SOW?" And gods forbid if a party member dies because their sow ran out at a bad time. So sometime between 10 and 14 I highly suggest leaving halas and doing a bit of exploring, kill some lions and sich in the karanas, see your first Cyclops in Rath mountains, kill a bear in the commons, visit Clan crush bone in Greater Faydark. What ever you want to do feel free, this is a play full time in my opinion, also be careful to get bound whenever you are in a city as dying isn’t fun. Or if you really want stay in everfrost and get lev 14 and all of your spells. What ever you do use this time to collect your banded armor and maybe a few magic items like rings and earrings. Either way lev 14 and a half is when you need to be ready to power again. <br><br> Lev 14 - 18 <br><br>                Ok lev 14 - 18 can be done in about 24 hours of solo playtime. In the Ocean Of Tears there are 2 places you can now hunt for great exp and ok loot. There are Alluring sirens, the good thing is you can now BIND your self where ever you want the bad thing is there is no place to run in a problem arises. You will need your DOT's and all your damage spells to beat them and I suggest getting the pairs on a rotation so you have 10 minutes between kills to med and then fight. This is a power levelers camp and isn’t very fun at ALL, but if you have a guild then that helps break the tedium, and yelling to the people on the boats is fun also. I don’t have the LOC for the 2 siren camps but I have directions, the main one is the twin peeks that one of the boats passes right in-between, just ride the boat till you pass through them and jump off and there you go. The 2nd is a little harder, get on the boat in Butcherblock and wait for it to zone into OOT, face the front of the boat and make a quick 5 count after you zone so you are away from the actual line, as jumping from the boat into a zone line is not fun. Now jump off the right side of the boat and swim a little ways till you see the small islets known as the coral reef, on one of the islands are 2 sirens and a few goblins.  Now be careful as one of the islands has a lev 40's troll shadowknight (he is just fishing so leave him ALONE!)<br><br> Lev 18 - 24 <br><br>Look I may not know everything BUT as far as I am concerned there is no place for this level like Lake Rathtear, it is on the south wall of S karanas. Go get a bind in the arena and get a small party to hunt the aviak guards, no faction and ok loot makes this a great hunt. Again make sure you have all of your newest spells and don’t stay in a party if it is unstable or can’t hold the camp. There are gypsies to sell to and I would scope out the barb-fishing village, as this is where you get your totemic armor quests. The fighting I leave up to you as we all have our own style. If you are a bit to social to too be alone that much this is also prime time for hunting in the castle of clan Crushbone.<br><br> FINALY LEV 24 - 38 <br><br>Ok you have reached what most of us consider the most fun levs of the game. It is time to explore those places you have heard about but never went to, to show off to the newbies, and to go find that mammoth calf and just SLAUGHTER IT. You can safely go to the best places in norrath, Unrest, Cazic Thule, Mistmoor, all will be great exp for lev 24 + and all will take you to the mid 30's. The loot is getting big and this is when you need to get all your items, keep a sharp eye out for good deals on items and DAMIT HAVE FUN! Personally I suggest Mistmoor from 24 - 31 and Cazic from 28 - 38 of course unrest will do for all of 24 - 38, but again you have that horrid death: exp ratio to worry about. I suggest you visit them all and find one you like the most. At lev 34 is when you get what I consider the life saver of a shaman, our power had started to fall off we don’t stand a chance in melee against a blue, and our casting was just starting to ebb. Then along comes our first pet spell "Companion spirit", and boy does that pet ROCK! Lev 30 is the first of the EXP "Speed Bumps" but it is lev 35 that kills most people off, that is when most start that other character. Personally I think the tower party in Cazic or you and a buddy at the blood pool in the basement of unrest is a GREAT way to get through 35, and once you do the exp starts moving again. <br><br> Lev 36 - 50<br><br>                Where as 24 - 36 are the most fun; this is the most boring, and the places to get exp suddenly become small as a gnome’s shoe. The Short and skinny of it is that SOLB and LowerGuk are about the only 2 main zones to get exp. Both have GREAT items if you get into the right parties but both cause death alot, because if one party falls apart the generally take the entire zone with them. Such is live in a high lev zone. Now there is one place that you can hunt, at lev 35 the Gnome guards (Watchmen) are white to you, killing them solo is a 70: 30 proposition in your favor so find a party member or 2 and camp one, the loot is pretty good also. At 39 you can solo these guards straight to lev 49 and the cash you get should but just about any items you want, at about 5pp per kill and a 6 minit spawn rate. The problem is that there r only 5 of them in the zone so they are camped 24 / 7 but if you are lucky and get one then all the more power to you. Here is my last warning, DONT EVEN BOTHER WITH THE PLANES TILL YOU ARE LEV 49 they are death traps YOU WILL DIE, PERIOD.<br><br>Canine Incarnate<br>Mithaniel Marr<br><br>If you have any Problems, suggestions, or additions please mail me at <a href='mailto:HeHeHeGS@hehe.com'>HeHeHeGS@hehe.com</a><br><br><br><br><br></center><form action='rate.php' method='post' name='rate'>
