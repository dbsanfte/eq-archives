 <center><h2>The Shaman Epic Weapon Quest</h2></center><br><br><i>(Originally created by Belgar)</i><br><br>Note: DO NOT perform any of the quest turn-ins while using Form of the Bear or Form of the Great Bear. Being in an illusion may bug the quest NPCs to misread your True Spirit faction and cause the quest trigger to fail.<br><br>Note: The entire quest is faction based. This means that are able to skip the latter parts by doing the first ones over and over again until you max your True Spirit faction. Once you have max faction, you can go straight to Lord Rak'Ashiir and turn in your child's tear. However, this can be very time consuming and is not recommended.<br><br>Note: There is no level restriction for the shaman epic quest. However, you do have to be level 46 to enter the Plane of Fear to get the tear. One can get around this by just having another shaman turn in the tear for them and then looting the scale (keep in mind that only a shaman can turn in the tear). If you are doing this, make sure you have maxed out your True Spirit faction beforehand using the above method.<br><br><br><br>Part 1 -  <a href='index2.php?page=epic1'>Beginning the Quest</a><br><br>Part 2 -  <a href='index2.php?page=epic2'>The Drunken Shaman</a><br><br>Part 3 -  <a href='index2.php?page=epic3'>The Test of Patience</a><br><br>Part 4 -  <a href='index2.php?page=epic4'>The Test of Wisdom</a><br><br>Part 5 -  <a href='index2.php?page=epic5'>The Test of Might</a><br><br>Part 6 -  <a href='index2.php?page=epic6'>The City of Mist Reports</a><br><br>Part 7 -  <a href='index2.php?page=epic7'>The Three Books of Ghiosk</a><br><br>Part 8 -  <a href='index2.php?page=epic8'>The High Scale Icon</a><br><br>Part 9 -  <a href='index2.php?page=epic9'>High Scale Kirn</a><br><br>Part 10 - <a href='index2.php?page=epic10'>Completing the Quest</a><br><br><br><img src='http://www.eqshaman.com/shaman/epic/spear.jpg'><br><br><br><br></center><br><u>Comments/Feedback:</u><br><br><i><b>NICOROB</b> says:</i><br><br>On part seven of epic i killed the lord with a group of 2 with 8 players and that includes one nuker...<br><br><br><i><b>NICOROB</b> says:</i><br><br>THE GROUP LEVELS WERE FROM 50 TO 64....<br><br><br><i><b>Anonymous</b> says:</i><br><br>killed 2 black reavers and lord ghiosk with 2 x 65 shm 1 x 65 ench and a 56 war.  was no prob. may have struggled with more black reavers before hand tho.<br><br><br><i><b>Anonymous</b> says:</i><br><br>killed 2 black reavers and lord ghiosk with 2 x 65 shm 1 x 65 ench and a 56 war.  was no prob. may have struggled with more black reavers before hand tho.<br><br><br><i><b>Anonymous</b> says:</i><br><br>Leave your comment here<br><br><br><i><b>Shammyin</b> says:</i><br><br>Just got epic on the 13th!

YOU CAN ONLY A: EVAC OR B: GATE. there is no zoneline to run too. DO THE QUEST IN ORDER OR IT WILL FAIL. its not worth backtracking all the quest cause you want to skip parts. If you dont have enough faction, do the first 4 parts over and over. its pretty simple to do after you get the hang of it.<br><br><br><i><b>Anonymous</b> says:</i><br><br>>> "Note: There is no level restriction for the shaman epic quest.<<

I had a friend MQ the tear for another shaman, both maxed on faction, he got the scale but the Spirit in the lake at his scale telling him we was to inexpirienced and how did he get his hands on it.
