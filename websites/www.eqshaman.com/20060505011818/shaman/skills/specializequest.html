To reset your specialization, all you need is a ruby (which can be bought at any gem merchant for about 131pp). Once you have that, go to Ostorm, a red Erudite in the Temple of Solusek Ro. Check out this <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/maps/Solusek_Ro.htm">map</a> to find him. The quest text is as follows:
<p>
<blockquote>You say, 'Hail, Ostorm'
<p>
Ostorm says, 'I am Ostorm of the Temple of Solusek Ro, guardian of the sacred crystal of Kintaz. Be wary and keep your distance, lest the proximity of the crystal [steal] your [memories].'
<p>
You say, 'How do they steal my memories?'
<p>
Ostorm says, 'It is the nature of Kintaz to steal the memories of those around it. Only I am safe, and then only because of the strong wardings placed on me by Solusek Ro himself. Are you interested in [losing] any [memories]?'
<p>
You say, 'I am interested in losing my memories.'
<p>
Ostorm says, 'Recently, I have been experimenting with the crystal, and have found those that exposed to the ruby light filtered through it tend to lose the memories of their most specialized arcane skills. Are you sure you want to [lose advanced memory] of specialization?'<br>
You say, 'Be warned that once exposed to the crystal, I can not reverse the effects. If you desire exposure, fetch me a ruby.'</blockquote>
<p>
Give him a ruby.
<p>
<blockquote>Osorm says, '...hear me? Ah, you seem to be coming out of your stupor. I think you have been exposed to the crystal long enough. By the time you leave the temple, your memories should have faded. Do you have the [fifty gold] coins that you owe me?'<br>
Your faction standing with Temple of Sol Ro got better.<br>
Your faction standing with Shadowed Men got worse.<br>
Your specialize skills have all been set to 49.<br>
You gain experience!</blockquote>
<p>
You will have to zone before the changes take effect. Ignore the part about the fifty gold coins.
