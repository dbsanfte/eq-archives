 <center><h2>EQShaman.com Shaman Guide</h2><br><br><b>The Shamans of Norrath</b><br><br>In the lands of Norrath, there are considered to be three primitive races. Those are the Barbarians of the Northern Plains of EverFrost, the Trolls from the southern swamps of Innothule, and the Ogres front the southern jungles of Feerott. Within these races, there is only one class than has a true casting ability from the start, and that is the Shaman. Many would argue that a Shaman is not a part of a viable group in the later phases of life, that a Shaman is more geared towards solo hunting. <br><br>This is not the case. <br><br>A Shaman can wear all armor except that within the plate mail line. There are very few piercing or slashing weapons a Shaman may wield, an ax being one of them, but the Shaman can wield almost all one-hand and two-hand blunt weapons. The Shaman also has a few skills specific to the class or race that most others do not have. And the Shaman is granted magic from the start of his life. This magic grants the Shaman the power to enhance or hinder abilities, to heal or hurt instantly, or to heal or hurt over long periods of time. <br><br>With these abilities, a Shaman can perform as a tank, a caster, a healer, a buffer, or a debuffer. A tank is the fighter in the front line that takes most of the damage and protects the casters while wielding a mighty weapon. A caster is one that wields powerful magic and creates big bangs for massive damage on an enemy. A healer is one who stands back and watches over the fight and heals his comrades as needed. A buffer is one who casts beneficial magic, such as strength or speed enhancements. A debuffer is one who hinders the abilities of the enemy, such as to slow its fighting or weaken its abilities or resistance. <br><br>It is true that a Shaman will never be as good a tank as a warrior, as good a caster as a wizard, as good a healer as a cleric, or as good a debuffer as an enchanter, but no one can come close to the buffing abilities of a Shaman. Also, no other class can do all of these things. How many wizards can charge into a fight and take the hits from a giant? A Shaman in the best buffer and good at everything else. No other class can boast being the best at anything and still be very good at everything else. <br><br><b>Who is a Shaman?</b><br><br>The only races allowed to be Shamans are Ogres, Trolls, and Barbarians. The choice of race will be totally dependent on exactly how you choose to play. If you want to spend a lot of time with "good" friends or traveling the lands with little fear of being killed by the local guards, the Barbarian is the way to go. However, Barbarians have no night vision. At night in the lands of Norrath, it is dark. The candle with which you start is not adequate to see everything. There are other light sources available, but nothing as good as true night vision. But this is only a problem at the lower levels. At level 9, Shamans get Serpent Sight, which grants Infravision; and at level 24, Shamans get Ultravision. So you only need worry about vision for a short while. <br><br>Barbarians also can wear medium or large armor. This allows for more usability of the loot gained and the ability to choose medium over large for the lesser weight. Additionally, Barbarians have the highest starting wisdom and charisma, which are two of the three primary skills for a Shaman. Barbarians also have good agility. Barbarians have a great newbie zone with lots to do and kill. <br><br><b>A Town Called Halas</b><br><br>Halas is a fairly small town, but has most things you will need to get started. In order to leave Halas you will have to either wait for the ferry or swim, and swimming is a necessary skill anyway. And there are vendors in the entrance to Halas and one on the Plains of EverFrost to buy your goods. The passes to Halas are crowded with lesser mobs, and they open to the plains of EverFrost where there are mobs up to mid twenties levels. EverFrost also connects to PermaFrost, a high level dungeon, and to BlackBurrow, which is a low-level dungeon. <br><br>The only disadvantage here is that Halas is on the far northern corner of the continent, which means a long run from most places, and to leave your homeland, you must pass through BlackBurrow and into Qeynos Hills, which can be deadly at the youngest levels. If you want the best overall stats, choose the Ogre. Ogres have only a few points lower wisdom than a Barbarian, so almost the same mana, and they have extremely high strength and stamina. Ogres do have lower charisma, so the best choice would be to increase charisma. Plus, Ogres get ultravision that is perfect night vision. This still does not mean that it is not dark, but you can see much better than any other race but Dark Elves. <br><br>The only drawbacks to Ogres are that they are large and evil. Being large means not fitting into many places and being forced to wear only large armor, which is heavier. But this is made up for by the extra strength. Being evil means that most npc’s in good zones will kill you on sight. The only towns that will accept you are your hometown and possibly the Troll and Dark Elf lands. It is possible to increase faction with the good races, but time consuming in most cases. Ogres also have a good starting zone, although not quite as good as the Barbarians or Trolls. There should be plenty to kill and do for almost all levels. <br><br>Plus, the Ogre starting zone has entries to Cazic Thule, which is a higher level dungeon, an area besieged by spectres, which are very high level mobs, an entry to Rathe Mountains, which is also a higher level area, and an entry to Innothule Swamps. Also, there are vendors here to sell wares. <br><br><b>Trolling Around</b><br><br>Being a Troll is not a bad choice. Trolls have much less wisdom than any of the others, which mean much less mana. Their strength is not even close to that or an Ogre. Low charisma and intelligence also hurt. But Trolls do have higher agility and dexterity, and Trolls have infravision, which is the ability to see heat in the dark. Though not as good as ultravision, it is still much better than the night vision of a Barbarian. This in itself does not totally make up for the lacking stats. What does that is the inborn Troll ability Regeneration. <br><br>This ability allows the Troll to heal at a rate much faster than the norm for all other races. Basically, a Troll can heal almost as fast standing as other races can sitting. This makes for less downtime and for longer fights as while the mob is doing damage, the Troll is healing. Additionally, Trolls have an excellent starting zone. It has mobs for most lower levels and is covered in water, which helps to build your swimming skill. Innothule is connected to the forests of Feerott, to Southern Ro Desert, and to the froglok dungeon Guk. Guk is a low to high level dungeon and is quite huge. Southern Ro has several orc camps, some undead ruins, and farther north in the sands of the zone are even some much higher level sand giants. Also, there is a vendor in the swamps to sell your wares. <br><br><b>The Skills of a Shaman</b><br><br>In addition to the normal skills for all classes, such as swimming and languages and trade skills, all Shamans start with skills in one-hand and two-hand blunt weapons, piercing weapons, abjuration, alteration, conjuration, divination, and evocation. At level four, Shamans can train in channeling. At level 8, Shamans can train in meditation. At 15, Shamans get dodge. And at 30, Shamans get specialization. Additionally, Shamans get the unique skill of Alchemy (ability to create potions) at level 25. The slam skill is inherent to all large races. Since Shamans are all large races, it fits well here. <br><br>Unlike a warrior who can actually train and become better at slam eventually doing damage as if a second attack, Shamans do not get the skill to train. But it is a viable combat skill. The best way to look at it is not as a second attack, but as a possible attack aid. Slam has the ability to disrupt an enemy caster. If you are in melee, slam will only do 1 point of damage if it hits, but even that is enough to interrupt an enemy caster. At level 20, the slam skill also gains the ability to stun, which can be very helpful dealing with fleeing mobs without wasting mana or in causing a short pause in the mob’s attacks. <br><br><b>Attributes for Shamans</b><br><br>The primary attributes for Shamans are stamina, wisdom, and charisma. Stamina allows casters more hit points with which to survive attack. Wisdom grants more mana with which to cast. And since much of the shamans magic is buff or debuff, charisma helps to overcome those resistances. This chart shows the starting stats for all Shamans. Additionally, all Shamans are given 30 skill points to distribute as they see fit. <br><br><br><code> STR  STA AGI DEX WIS INT CHR <br>Barbarian 103 100 82 70 80 60 60 <br>Ogre 130 127 70 70 77 60 42 <br>Troll 108 119 88 75 60 52 42</code><br><br>Stamina affects hit points per level as well as ability to run or wield heavy weapons for long times. Each swing of a weapon take a little stamina, as does each stroke swimming or step running or leap jumping. <br><br>Wisdom affects the ability to resist alteration magic, such as charm or debuffs. Wisdom is also the attribute that directly affects the amount of mana available for hybrids and healers. For a Shaman, higher wisdom means higher mana. <br><br>Charisma affects the reaction of non-player characters (npc's) and the prices obtained buying or selling goods. It also affects the caster's ability to overcome the target’s resistances to alteration magic. In other words, higher charisma means debuffs are not resisted as much. <br><br>Strength affects the amount that can be carried and the chance to hit at maximum with a weapon. Having higher strength does not mean you hit harder. Each weapon has a maximum hit value. Having higher strength means your chance of hitting for maximum damage is increased. As to weight allowance, better armor is often more heavy, thus more strength is needed. Also, many of the better two-handed weapons are quite heavy. Having higher strength means a better ability to wield those weapons. <br><br>Agility affects the ability to avoid being hit. This directly relates to base armor class and chance to successfully dodge a blow. The more hits avoided, the less damage taken. <br><br>Dexterity affects the ability to hit or recover from being hit. Higher dexterity means a greater chance of hitting an opponent, especially with ranged weapons. Dexterity also determines how quickly one recovers from being hit so that he can strike again, or so he can cast the spell. It additionally affects a caster's ability to avoid being interrupted. <br><br>Intelligence affects the speed at which skills are learned. It also directly relates to the amount of mana for a caster. For a Shaman, higher intelligence means the ability to maximize skills more quickly, but has no affect on mana. <br><br> <br><br><b>Turning Skills into Strategy</b><br><br>For a Shaman, regardless of race, the best course is to put all possible skill points into wisdom. This will maximize the amount of spells able to be cast. For a Troll, this is critical as the Trolls have the least initial wisdom. The remaining five points can go into any attribute. More strength means carrying more. More agility means getting hit less. More dexterity means less interruption. More stamina means more hit points. More charisma means cheaper prices. <br><br>If you choose a Troll or Ogre, charisma might not be a bad selection as charisma also affects the ability to overcome resistance for alteration magic. For a Troll, intelligence might be best or you will still be learning skills from the last level when you make the next one. For a Barbarian, strength is good for the extra carrying capacity. Agility is always better than stamina as a choice because being hit less means you do not need the extra hit points, plus, all of the classes available for Shamans have very high stamina anyway. Regardless of what the last five points are put into, there is no wrong choice. All abilities are nice to have increased, but none are as critical as wisdom. <br><br> <br><br><b>Additional Starting Choices</b><br><br>The choice of gender is personal preference. It has no effect on abilities. It does, however, affect your role-playing, just as does the choice of a name. Try to choose a name appropriate to your race. To see a female Troll named Bob doesn't speak of someone trying to role-play. Try to choose a name to match the race and gender, that is, if your intention is to role-play. The last choice is that of a deity. For Barbarians, there is no choice. <br><br>If you are a Shaman, you will be a follower of the Tribunal. They believe in justice above all else, even above courts, that justice reigns supreme and violators of this will suffer the vengeance of the Tribunal. For Ogres, there is also no choice. All Ogre Shamans must be followers of Rallos Zek, the WarLord. These followers believe only in strength and power, that it is truly survival of the fittest. <br><br>For Trolls, you have a choice of Cazic-Thule, the Faceless and Innoruuk, the Prince of Hate. Followers of Cazic-Thule believe the fear conquers all, that the world can be ruled by enforcing oppression with fear. Followers of Innoruuk believe that hate is the creative force of all things that by destroying with hate, they can bring about new creation. Either choice for a Troll is okay. If you follow Innoruuk, the Dark Elves are more likely to like you, but the good races will not. If you choose the Faceless, some will like you some will not. <br><br>Either way, regardless of deity, there will be some npc's that like you and some that hate you merely for the choice. Starting location is also set based on race. From this point, you enter the world of Norrath as a newly born Shaman.<br><br> <br><br><b>Beginning as a Shaman</b><br><br>All Shamans start with a newbie club, a Tome of Discord, five food and water, a letter to the Guildmaster, and two spells. Barbarians also start with a candle. The two spells are Minor Healing and Inner Fire. The first thing you should do is scribe the spells. To do this, click the spellbook button and then click the spell, dragging it to an open spot on the open spellbook. It will begin to scribe. When finished, scribe the other. Once both are scribed, memorize them both. Click the spell in the book and a button will attach to the mouse. Move the button over to the left and drop it in an open spot along the left edge of the book (all will be open at this point). Then memorize the other one.<br><br>In EverQuest, all spells consume mana. You memorize the spell, then you may cast it as many times as you like and have mana for. To cast something different, simply night click the spell button and you will forget the spell so you can memorize another one. The spell will still be in the book. After this, click done in the lower right corner and you will stand. Open inventory (click the persona button), the open your equipment (button above your picture on the right). Equip the club (click and drag the club from inventory to the first hand slot (lower left most slot on equipment). If you are a barbarian, also place the candle in your other hand. It will not show on the character, but will provide a little light, though not much. <br><br>Now, make the choice of Order or Discord. If you want to compete in Player versus player combat, then find the Priest of Discord and give him the Tome of Discord, and he will make you pvp. If you will never want to be pvp, simply destroy the Tome. If you are undecided, then put the Tome in the bank. Just remember if you choose pvp, no one will be able to heal you other than another pvp. If you want to play pvp, the best choice is to play the pvp server. <br><br>Next, find your Guildmaster. In Halas, the Shaman guild is around the corner to the left of the bank. Go down into the guild and the last booth on the end is the Guildmaster and two vendors. In Grobb, the Shaman guild is just to the right of the bank. In Oggok, the Shaman guild is in the caves on the East of the main pass (go in the front and go to the right). Read the letter (double right click). It will tell you whom to find. Give the letter to that person, and you will get a tiny bit of experience and a newbie tunic. The tunic will afford you a little bit of armor class protection for the upcoming fights. <br><br>Now talk to the Guildmaster (right click). The best course is to put all five starting points into one-hand bashing (for the club). This will make you hit more often in combat. Then, talk to everyone in the guild (click the person and hit "h" for hail). Be very careful not to accidentally hit a, or forget to hit enter before typing. If you hit a, that's attack, and you will be killed. Some of the npc's may talk to you. If you pick the right words out of the text in your talk back to them, they will offer you quests. Many of the quests are as yet unfinished, but there are a few for the newbie characters. Check on the quests available here. They won't tell you what they will reward you, but one of the quests will grant you a first order spell. Get all the quests you can and worry about how to finish them if at all later. <br><br> <br><br><b>The Pros of Con</b><br><br>One last thing to remember ... con everything. This is done by either right clicking the target, or selecting the target and clicking the con button or typing "/con". This will tell you how hard the mob is related to you. It is not 100% accurate, but much better than nothing. The cons are in colors and text. Be sure to ready it all. If it scowls at you, then it will attack. If it is amiable, then it likes you a lot, will talk to you or sell to you at a very good price if it does that at all. And there are colors ranging from green meaning you will most likely not get any experience and the kill would be fairly easy to red meaning it would mash you. And within each color, there is specific text, such as "you might win" or "you would have the upper hand". <br><br>Be sure to judge and read all creatures before attaching. You will find that some of the little creatures are even tougher than the big ones. This will be particularly important when traveling to other lands. Con the guards from a good distance to see if they will kill you. If they are Dubious or better, then you should be safe. This is also a good time to setup your hot keys. I would definitely setup one for attack, one for slam, one for spells, one for persona, one for sit, and one for sense heading. <br><br>No matter where you are or what you are doing, keep clicking sense heading. It will take forever for it to get up, but it is worth it. I placed attack on the lower left, slam center left, and sense heading center right. In combat, first click combat, then click slam. Then, click sense, and every time sense becomes available, click it again, just be careful to watch the entire fight and not just the sense button. This will allow the skill to raise more quickly since you will be using it more. Now you are ready to face the world. Head back to the entrance to the town and zone into the wilds. <br><br> <br><br><b>First Order (Level 1 to 4)</b><br><br>As soon as you zone into the wilds, cast Inner Fire on yourself. Once it is cast, sit a few and let your mana rebuild. If you fizzle a few times, just keep trying. Inner Fire will give you an additional 2 armor class and 20 hit points. Once your mana is full, stand up and run out into the wilds themselves. Remember, here is where you must con everything. Find a blue con creature. Make sure the creature is alone, as many creatures will help one another. Spiders, for example, will leave you alone for the most part. But as soon as you attack one, all others near will attack. <br><br>Pay very close attention to where you are and where the guards are. If you get in over your head, turn and run for the guards. They will kill anything attacking you in most cases, although it may get in a few more hits on you before it's gone. And always be on the lookout for whatever was asked for in the quests. If you are Barbarian, the best spot is just at the entrance to the pass to where the two guards stand by the campfires before the cave to Halas. <br><br>Many woolly spiderlings and white wolves, decaying skeletons, gnoll pups, ice goblin welps, and polar bear cubs will go by. Spiderlings will not attack unless attacked. The rest will attack, so stand back. The gnolls and goblins sometimes have sacks or bags, the decaying skeletons sometimes have rusty weapons, the spiderlings sometimes have silk and fungus and legs, the wolves and bears have meat and pelts. The gnolls, goblins, and skeletons also sometimes carry a few coins. <br><br>If you are Ogre, just outside the gate, turn left about 45 deg (SE) as if headed towards Innothule. There are lots of snakes, bats, decaying skeletons, froglok tads, jungle spiderlings, and lizard men. Just be sure to con each before attacking. The bats, snakes, and spiders should be non-aggressive unless attacked. The lizard men sometimes have armor or weapons, and the decaying skeletons sometimes have weapons. The rest have wings, or silk, or something to sell. And be sure to keep all of your snake scales, even if you have to bank them. They will be very useful later. <br><br>If you are Troll, just outside the gate, keep heading a little N along the wall and just into the swamp. There are lots of rats, snakes, fungus man trackers, frogloks, kobolds, and decaying skeletons. The rats and snakes should be non-aggressive. The frogloks sometimes have netted or clothe armor, which you can wear or sell. I would be sure to keep every pair of netted gloves you find, however. They can be sold to Monks for a pretty good price since they are magical, which grant the monk a magical attack. Also, keep all your snake scales, even if you have to put them in the bank. You won't regret it. <br><br> <br><br><b>Attack or be Attacked</b><br><br>Once you have selected a target, run up to it, hit it, then fall back to a fairly safe area from which to you can fight or quickly escape if needed. Fighting in the water is not good as at this point, the mobs will always be a much better swimmer than you. At this level, you shouldn't be fighting any casters, so use the slam skill every chance you get. The extra point of damage isn't much, but every little bit helps. As you start to take damage, target yourself (hit F1), click your minor heal button, then retarget the mob (click it) and continue attacking. When you kill it, right click the corpse and take whatever is there. <br><br>If you still have good mana and hit points, then attack something else. Otherwise, back up to the wall and sit to heal and refresh mana. When ready, go again. When your inventory is full, run back to the closest vendor, sell everything you don't need, and then head out again. Be sure to keep your Inner Fire up. It should last about 15 minutes before dropping. In all the areas, the spider and spiderling silk sells well (over a gold and just over a silver respectively). Rusty weapons can also be worth as much as a few gold. Whenever possible, take out anything carrying a weapon as the weapons can be sold. Also, be sure to watch the mobs you kill for a better weapon for you. <br><br> <br><br><b>Hand’s On Fighting</b><br><br>Although the newbie club is decent, it's not too grand. A Cracked Staff is a much better one-hand blunt weapon, and it usually goes for just over a plat if you want to stick with one-hand blunt. The other choice is to go for two hand blunt, in which case you will need to find a worn great staff or a rusty war hammer. Anything will do. Just remember that the faster you can hit, the faster your skill will go up. If you go with a rusty weapon, then get a smith to polish it for you into a tarnished weapon. That will give you another 2 from the delay. It's not much, but every little bit helps. If you stick with one-hand, then you can use a shield for extra armor class. If you go two-hand, you loose the shield but have a better choice of weapons later in life. <br><br>The best bet is to keep going back and forth to get both up as high as possible. It isn't really important to train both at this age, but it will become more and more important as you grow older. As soon as you have enough coins, the first thing to buy is a bag or pack or purse. The purse is usually first since it is only a little over a silver and holds 4 items. Put your food and water and anything else you find there and keep making trips and selling. The more you can carry, the less trips you will have to make. Every chance you get, buy a new o bigger pack so that you can carry more. Don't worry much about weight since you are as big as a house and just as strong. Just make as few trips as possible. <br><br> <br><br><b>Spelling Victory</b><br><br>The next thing to buy is your spells. The first one you should get is burst of Flame. It will allow you to tag a mob from a distance instead of running up to the mob, hitting it, then running back. It allows you to bring the mob to you instead of you going to it. And the damage isn't too bad. It does 5 damage for 7 mana, which can be a big help in a fight. Just remember that spells are always more important than armor. First get all your spells, then start buying armor as you can. <br><br>The next spells to pick up are Strengthen and Dexterous Aura. They will give you 10 points of strength and dexterity respectively, which will come in handy making you more powerful and able to carry more weight. If you have enough, then you can pick up Endure Cold and Cure Disease, but neither are really necessary. In the newbie grounds, there is little to disease you yet, and there are no casters to hurt you with cold magic. Flash of Light is a nice spell as it reduces the mob's chance of hitting you, but it is not available anywhere close. It is sold in Oasis, but that is a dangerous trip for a level 4 player. The spell is also sold in some cleric guilds, although you may need to have a friend buy it for you since the clerics may not be too fond of a tamer of spirits. <br><br> <br><br><b>Happy Hunting</b><br><br>As you increase in level, don't spend any more skill points just yet. If you get killed, don't worry about it. Just look at it that you get more free food and water (up to level 4). And be sure to save as much money as possible. If you work it correctly, you should be almost to level 4 within an hour of play. But don't make level 4 just yet. Just before you do, find a safe spot and get killed. <br><br>Yes, get killed on purpose, but it has to be before you make level 4. In less than 1 kill, you will get back much more than you lost. Plus, you will restart with 5 more free food and water. If you don't care about the food and water, don't get killed. Just go back and loot your body and go on. As soon as you hit level 4, run back to the guild. Put one point into Channeling to prime the skill or learn the basics. Channeling will help you to keep from being interrupted while casting. Also, in order to cast, you must be stationary for 2 seconds. With very high channeling, you can actually sometimes reduce this. But don't count on the skill to be 100% effective. Once you get the skill, just head back out and continue hunting. <br><br><a href='index2.php?page=mainguide2'>MORE...</a><br><br><br><br><br><br></center><form action='rate.php' method='post' name='rate'>
