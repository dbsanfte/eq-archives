 <center><h2>Perspective on a Shaman</h2></center><br><br>Well, this my perspective on shaman.<br><br>When creating a shaman, put <i>all</i> your points in wisdom, then stamina. I did half and half and i regret it. Its more important to have hps and ac on gear then to have max wis, especialy when:<br><br>A) Your new to playing a slower.<br><br>B) You have tanks that just cant keep agro.<br><br>When levelling up there seems to be 2 ways to play our class: Shamans are chain class, therefore can get ok ac. Our mitigation sucks but the armor out there is quite nice, and relatively cheap. So one way to play your shaman is to think all hps and ac, with wis as a third objective. The other way and alot of the way people play them is as a pure caster, throwing all their gear into wisdom and focus effects. Like wearing an emerald dargonscale tunic up into the 40s plus range just because of the wis. By doing that you will lose about 20 ac that you could gain for around 2500pp with a crypt robber's chest plate. The point here is to have the best ac and hps so you can take the hits, cause let's face it; in those groups, ldons, raids etc where you are casting, you <i>will</i> steal agro. I've seen a lot of shamans go down just like enchanters do, not good. I have over 1k ac, 2700 hps unbuffed using 90 percent dropable gear at level 64. Been playing something like 8 months, with a play time of over 47 days logged, not on trader.<br><br>Playing as the pure caster may have the benefits of more mana, less med time, but the benefits of having the ac and hps is just to great to warant the other style of play for me.<br><br>When to slow? This is a topic some people just don't agree on. I personally think in one group situation until level 55 or so, slow as soon as the mob is pulled.  I have been in disagreement with guildies and players I know over this. Yes you will get agro if tank can not keep it, but it saves you a heal on the tank and makes dealing with adds so much easier. In ldons and such you will have 5 mobs pulled, and a good slower can save a group by just slowing all the mobs, soon as possible. If you are having problems with slow landing, keep more than one slow up if you can, tough if you are healing tho. Some people seem to think you should not slow till 80 percent or so, so the tank can get prime agro control. In some cases this makes sense, but until the mobs start hiting for over 200 I totally disagree; the mob is going to do a lot more damage, costing the healer a lot more mana, which in some cases will be you. If the mob does agro you it will hit with a lot less speed than it would have anyway. This excludes some instances with raid mobs and higher level zones - but if you are there, you already knew that, right?<br><br>Well thats all for now, plz feel free to post your thoughts, flame away or just correct me on my spelling. Hope this helps some newbie shamans! - <i>Lazzile 64th shaman Vallon Zek, Open Hand</i><br>    <br><br><br><br></center><br><u>Comments/Feedback:</u><br><br><i><b>Anonymous</b> says:</i><br><br>The way i play my shammie: i root, slow,dot them. When i have a pet i sent that after it is fully buffed. Then i sit, med, when root breaks i reroot, heal pet, dot again and when it runs i melee a bit.
<br><br><br><i><b>The Best Shammy</b> says:</i><br><br>I agree with you..in the slowing side of it ..very true cost more mana healing that tank that took 1500 dam befor i can cast slow ..and as a shammy just root after slow and you will be fine....<br><br><br><i><b>Mordel-Bertox</b> says:</i><br><br>I ahve been in disagreement with my GF over this subject, I agree wth you it is alot better to slow in the begining. I have been in groups with people that have been really happy that I slow from the start.<br><br><br><i><b>Anonymous</b> says:</i><br><br>I always pull with slow. If it takes (and the vast majority of time it does) then the mob is dead meat. Send in the pet, root, DoT, repeat.

I never lose aggro and can chain cast with my shaman if I desired.  I pull with a double cast of ensnare and turgurs.  Instant slowed lunch.<br><br><br><i><b>Flobdeth on AB</b> says:</i><br><br>If you have a pally or an SK as you MT you dont have to worry about agro from slows, If warrior is MT by the time he has fired off two arrows its safe to malo/s once the mob has arrived at the MT you should give it 4-5 seconds before hitting off a turgurs to give him enough time to gain agro on the mob, this is ok for single pulls, Agro on multiple mobs is far harder, as for big/raid mobs slow shouldnt be cast until Assist has been called malos is good a couple of seconds before preferably with a second shaman casing slow after you malos to spread agro!  

LDoN is a totaly differant kettle of fish, everyones seen the 3-4 mobs come in at once on a bad pull in this instance you got no choice but to run into MT shout AE slow inc and hit off a Tigirs, MT has agro on one you back off with the others to park them 9/10 someone will grab the agro off at least one of these mobs so you can roots off and leaving you free again to either offtank or heal the offtank.

I could go on and on about slowing a fair bit more but the jist of it is HP AC is GOD on a shaman never mind maxxing your wis you can eat yourself to death if needs be and it isnt hard to work on all three stats at the same time<br><br><br><i><b>Ragan Hatespreader of Vazaelle</b> says:</i><br><br>I agree on slowing first, or rather send in pet then slow (as pet takes one hit of a hot key) 99% of the time shaman are used souly as slowers (pets are bonus dps) and back up heals. So it would make sense to do what your needed to first. If you take aggro just remember to stand so warriors can get to mob to taunt.
 The only thing i really disagree with is ac over wisdom. I am a Troll so my stamina is sweet to start, all evil shaman i would recommend wis first as we are naturally...um...disadvantaged in this area. With our natural buffing power the rest of our stats come along nicely.<br><br><br><i><b>Ham from BB</b> says:</i><br><br>As a 59 Vah Shir shaman,I find it easier in Non raid situations to malo, root then slow. I have a spell haste III item so they cast fairly fast. If Malo is resisted, I still cast slow regardless. <br><br><br><i><b>Ham from BB</b> says:</i><br><br>As a 59 Vah Shir shaman,I find it easier in Non raid situations to malo, root then slow.

I have worked hard on armor (ever been summoned?) and can take a few whacks from a slowed mob and live.  If I pull (not very often these days) I pull with malo, then slow.  That way, even if it gets to me, I am not taking a pounding.  <br><br><br><i><b>Ham from BB</b> says:</i><br><br>Oh I also forgot to mention I use a extended range item in addition to the spell haste so I can cast all three prior to mob being in camp spot. I know this is not the norm for everyone but it really helps especially when out side.<br><br><br><i><b>Ham from BB</b> says:</i><br><br>Oh I also forgot to mention I use a extended range item in addition to the spell haste so I can cast all three prior to mob being in camp spot.

Few issues with your article.  First, Slow on incoming, always, if you get aggro tank will pull it off if you stand still, or you can root and back off.  Second, the Sta/Wis thing is debatable.  IMO you need both, since as a shammy, HP=Mana and Wis=Mana.

In alot of cases, I am the healer, slower, haster, and ghetto mezzer.  so you need the mana pool your Wis gives you to keep up with all that work.. but need the HP to canni yourself down, and still be able to take a hit or 2. Just my 2 cents =)<br><br><br><i><b>Just another Shammy</b> says:</i><br><br>These have all benn good comments only one I would add is if you are not pulling stand right next to your tank as you slow so even if you get agro you will not ping pong and the tank will be able to reaquire agro quickly then you can back away.
<br><br><br><i><b>Dasha</b> says:</i><br><br>The best thing to do is cast Malosi line of spells as the mob is like one step from attacking main tank..  this spell draws little agro..  After you cast that spell immedialtly do it again if it resisted if it resists the 2nd time throw your disease based slow..  if you had malo hit throw your magic based slow...  This works great..  Or just have a Paladin main tank and you can malo slow and cripple in the first 10% or so for best meelee dam....<br><br><br><i><b>Dasha</b> says:</i><br><br>The best thing to do is cast Malosi line of spells as the mob is like one step from attacking main tank..  this spell draws little agro..
