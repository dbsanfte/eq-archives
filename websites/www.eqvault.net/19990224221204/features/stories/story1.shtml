Today I decided to have some fun. I was going to get a high level character and go adventuring with the big boys of beta and write it all up into a story to ut up on the Vault. In preparing to do this, I met up with only one problem. I had no high level characters. No problem. I sent a msg to a GM, explained my dilemma, and he instantly zapped up a new monk to level 30. I was ready to rock and roll.<p>

I was up there in the range of the highest beta testers that exist currently in Norrath. The highest? Kendrick, a level 34 rogue who backstabs with the best of 'em. Only one problem, I knew where Kendrick was, I just didn't know how to get there. The GM was still hanging around after beefing me up, again, I explained to him what I wanted to do, and he teleported me to where Kendrick was. He was with a warrior named Jalen, another of the highest level testers in beta. With this, the GM left, and I was on my own. If it couldn't be done by a mortal, I couldn't do it.<p>

After introducing myself to both testers, we got down to business, action. We were in South Karana, near a spot where cyclopses spawn. We spotted our first one eyed hulk and headed over to put a hurtin' on it. That cyclops hit for abotu 50 damage a shot, but with a little coordination, and some special attacks by me and Kendrick, we were able to best the behemoth, and send him to cyclops heaven. (Screenshots: <a href="1-1.jpg">one</a>, <a href="1-2.jpg">two</a>, and <a href="1-3.jpg">three</a>)<p>

While we were cyclops hunting, I saw an <a href="1-4.jpg">elephant</a> wandering in the distance, and I wanted a closer look... a half minute run revealed to me the most beautifully created animal I have yet to see in EverQuest. Whoever did the art for these elephants needs a raise. The elephant walked like the real thing, looked like the real thing, and the size was about right for the real thing as well... In the screenshot, Kendrick is running with the elephant under its belly. You can see the size comparison.<p>

After doing this for about an hour and a half, we decided to go to a dungeon called Najena.
The majority of creatures in this dungeon were below our level, but there are several boss
monsters in the dungeon to be wary of.  I was all for the trip, I wanted some adventure, and
I wanted excitement. ;)<p>

So... the journey begins, and what a journey it is... I have heard the world is huge, but this was the first time I had to make a big journey, and they aren't kidding!!! This world is huge, but I'll be a cyclops if it doesn't have some eye candy in it that will drop your jaw like nothin else. I only got to see a few spectacles on my journey, I can't imagine how many there are in all the world, not to mention the two continents that haven't been added yet.<p>

After a long run through the plains, we came to a body of water, we followed that for a while, until we came to a beautiful white bridge, leading to South Karana. I couldn't help but taking a screenshot of it, but it really doesn't do it justice, you need to be there to fully appreciate it. (Screenshots: <a href="1-5.jpg">one</a> and <a href="1-6.jpg">two</a>)<p>

What was I greeted with immediately upon crossing the zone line? A <a href="1-7.jpg">four story tower</a> on the south side of the bridge! I ran up inside the tower and climbed up onto the roof. I looked south, and saw another thing that completely amazed me. <a href="1-8.jpg">Two pair of obelisks</a>, curving in toward each other, lit from below with a blue glow. They didn't seem to serve much of a purpose, but they sure looked cool!

After the crossing the bridge and entering South Karana, I proceeded to hunt for a willowisp, because they carry Greater Lightstones. A Greater Lightstone is a great source of light, and since we were going to a dark dungeon, I was going to need one. After finding and killing a wisp, we went to a gypsy camp. I sold off some loot that I had from animals and cyclopses that we had fought so far, and saw my purse get fatter... I knew I was going to have to hit a bank soon.<p>

We followed a dirt road to <a href="1-9.jpg">another bridge</a>, this one even more amazing than the first! This one was constructed of wood, with elaborate suspension cables. The wood was carved with ornate designs and everything! This is one of the more detailed features I've seen in EverQuest, another kudos goes out to the designer who made this bridge. I ran across.<p>

That is when EverQuest crashed. Why? I lost connection to my internet service provider, and I had to reconnect. Unfortunately, my character had not timed out yet, and I couldn't log back into Norrath. My buds waited a few minutes for me, but I guess they thought I was a lost cause, and continued their journey. After 35 minutes I was able to log back into East Karana, the bad news? Kendrick and Jalen were in Nektulos forest. What does that mean for me? I was lost, and I was a half hour behind them. I'd never be able to find them. Thank god, the GM that had helped me earlier was online. I explained my plight, and he was able to transport me to Nektulos.<p>

By that time my Kendrick and Jalen were in Lavastorm(they just don't waste any time when it comes to traveling), but there was a path straight through Nektulos to lavastorm, and they were waiting for me. That's when a guard attacked me, and I remembered I was in Dark Elf territory(they don't like humans, apparently), I began running as fast as my feet would carry me, which is when I got a message from Kendrick. "Watch out for the guards." The msg had come 30 seconds too late, I was running for my life through Nektulos forest, charging at flank speed to lavastorm. I turned and faced the guard and began to fight him.<p>

I was winning the fight, so the guard yelled for help. 2 more guards showed up. I turned tail and ran. On the way through Nektulos I picked up about 4 more guards. There I was, running through the forest, with 7 guards on my tail screaming about how humans didn't belong in their realm, and that they would going to kill me. What else did I hear? the other players laughing their heads off. I suppose I would have laughed in their place, but I didn't think it was too funny at the time. I made it to the lavastorm zone line, and went through. The guards broke their chase and returned to their posts, thankfully.<p>

Jalen was waiting for me in lavastorm, Kendrick had crashed and wasn't back yet. We were on our own. We walked through lavastorm without being attacked, and arrived at <a href="1-10.jpg">the entrance to Najena</a>. We clombed through and zoned into the dungeon. Jalen lead me down a few corridors, and he began to lure monsters back to our campout for us to fight one at a time. We did that for about an hour, when some other people showed up. One of them was a Halfling named Khelbin(who I later found out was BlkStaff, the owner of the #everquest IRC channel).<p>

 We fought together for a while, and we all went down further into the dungeon to get a big group of monsters. I was running aroung rabbit punching all kinds of monsters, and doing well! But... I made a classic mistake... I forgot to keep my eye on my HP meter as close as I should have. Before I knew it, I was looking at my corpse, waiting for my home city to load.<p>

There I appeared, naked, penniless, and a level lower than I was before(went down to 29 because of the death), which pissed me off. I can't imagine how much it would have angered someone that had earned lvl 30 legitimately! I had about 220 platinum on my corpse. For those of you who have not played and don't really understand the value of money in EverQuest, let me make a reference, here... I would drop a sexual harassment lawsuit against the President of the USA if he gave me 220 platinum in EverQuest. Now you should know just about how much money that is. There was NO way I was letting that corpse decay in Najena, I had to go back and get it... Luckily, I was only two zones away from Nektulos, and I knew the way there, and from there to Najena. Here we go again.<p>

I got to Nektulos without a problem, and then ran like a madman to lavastorm, guards chasing me just as before. I got back to Najena without a big problem(muchly due to the fact that I am a Monk, and don't need weapons or armor to survive). I went inside and discovered there was a problem I hadn't thought about. I was totally blind. And when I say totally blind, I mean just that. It was pitch black. I had taken the Greater Lightstone for granted. Now I was up a creek without a paddle.<p>

 I sent a msg to Khelbin and asked him to loot my corpse and bring my items back. I used an EverQuest command that allows someone to loot your corpse, and off he went. In about 10 minutes, he was back with all my items, and 6 monsters on his tail. My items had slowed him down to the point where he couldn't run. Yikes. We zoned to lavastorm to get away from the monsters and exchange items. He gave me my stuff back, I gave him many thanks. and we parted ways. I ran as fast as I could back to Freeport(and yes, the guards chased me back through Nektulos AGAIN), and banked that cash. At this time, it was 5:30AM, and I had blown the whole night playing EQ.<p>

The result of this little escapade? The most fun night I have ever spent playing EverQuest. Time spent? 6 hours, 38 minutes.<p>
