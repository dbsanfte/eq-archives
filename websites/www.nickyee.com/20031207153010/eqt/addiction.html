            <p class="normal"><span style='mso-bookmark:_Toc504281387'>About two-thirds 
              (62.1%, N=2328) of EQ players would consider themselves addicted 
              to EQ. There are no significant age or gender differences.</span></p>

            <hr size="1">
            <p class="normal">How many hours is too many hours of EQ? And does 
              that automatically equate to addiction? Many respondents tried to 
              grapple with this issue:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p class="normal">I play EQ for 18 month now. And when I take all 
                time of my characters and calculet the average I played 4h a day. 
                This is mad. I tryed to stop playing EQ for some month, because 
                I had to do a excam. But I found me everyday looking through the 
                internet and reading EQ sites. I often find me thinking about 
                EQ and daydreaming. I am addicted and know that, and I like it. 
                [m, 24]</p>
              <p class="normal">I like to play EQ alot. I play whenever I have 
                free time. I don't watch tv during the week anymore but I don't 
                miss it at all. I tape some shows on some nights that I watch 
                on the weekend. I play at work as well during lunch. Basically 
                if I don't have to do anything I will play EQ. I don't consider 
                myself addicted but I can say it takes a lot of my time. I enjoy 
                playing many of my characters but not as much as I do playing 
                with the same people all the time and friends I have made in the 
                game and guildmates. If I had to play without them I would just 
                solo until I was able to play with them. [m, 28]</p>
              <p class="normal">I do think i am an EQ addict, and yes I have tryd 
                to stop. This was after i got my brother hookd on it tho, so even 
                after i quit, he beggd me to get back on to play with him. I held 
                out for a long time, but I eventualy crackd, and got re-addicted. 
                I think i like EQ, but i cant be shure. Its just to damn addicting 
                to know if i actuialy enjoy the game. You might say, &quot;well 
                you would know if you like it or not&quot; Well that might be 
                true for some, but i just dont know. [m, 17]</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="normal">On the other hand, there were clear-cut cases where 
              the respondents themselves recognized that their game-play was seriously 
              affecting them:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p class="normal">Yes, I am now officially a hermit. I had problems 
                keeping in touch with old friends to begin with. Now its rare 
                I see anyone other than the two people I live with. Both of which 
                also play EQ, constantly. My girlfriend, and my roommate. Neither 
                of them have jobs, and both of them play EQ 95% of their time 
                awake. When I come home from work in the morning, my girl logs, 
                and sits in my lap and watches me play. I dont have a phone plugged 
                in anymore, I just check messages now and then. I dont answer 
                my door. I barely talk to any friends or family. We have fun, 
                I love EQ... but it -IS- without a doubt, an addiction. When your 
                sitting there, knowing you have important things to do, but keep 
                playing anyway... when your two closest loved ones cant pry themselves 
                from &quot;the game&quot; to get themselves lives... when there 
                is no food or clean clothes... etc... etc... [m, 22]</p>
              <p class="normal">Yes, I consider myself addicted to EQ. I haven't 
                tried quitting yet, but I will have to in a few months. I don't 
                spend enough time with my 2 1/2 year old daughter. I'm a full-time 
                mom, and my daughter watches TV all day while I play the game. 
                In September, I will start homeschooling her, so I'll have to 
                cut down on my EQ time. I'd like to stop now so I would have time 
                to take her to the park during the week, or even let her play 
                in the backyard, but leveling, getting new spells and new skills 
                is all I think about. [f, 27]</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="normal">Several respondents articulated some of the effects 
              of withdrawal:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p class="normal">I recently had to spend two weeks in another country 
                for my job. Because the latency back to the US was so horrible 
                there, I couldn't play EQ (600ms and greater). A day didn't go 
                by that I wasn't thinking about it - would my friends surpass 
                me in levels, would I lose interest in the game from not playing 
                (yes, I was actually worried about this). I made a point of browsing 
                the message boards every day to see what Verant was up to, found 
                myself feeling anger and delight in the opinions expressed by 
                both sides. I am now a permanent part of this community. [m, 27]</p>
              <p class="normal">I am addicted to EQ and I hate it and myself for 
                it. When I play I sit down and play for a minimum of 12 hours 
                at a time, and I inevitably feel guilty about it, thinking there 
                a large number of things I should be doing instead, like reading 
                or furthering my education or pursuing my career. But I can't 
                seem to help myself, it draws me in every time. I have been out 
                of work now for over a month and now find myself in a stressful, 
                depressed state that it only quelled when I am playing EQ, because 
                it's easy to forget about real world troubles and problems, but 
                the problem is when you get back to the real world, problems and 
                troubles have become bigger, and it's a bad, bad cycle. I've tried 
                quitting seriously on several occassions, but I was shocked to 
                find each time that the experience reminds of what I've heard 
                quitting heroin is like. There are serious withdrawal pangs, anxiety, 
                and a feeling of being lost and not quite knowing what next to 
                do with yourself. I don't think this could possibly be the norm 
                for most people, maybe I just have an addictive personality, although 
                I've never been addicted to anything before in my life. [m, 26]</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="normal">Many respondents gave reasons for why they felt 
              the game was so addictive. One often-cited reason was that it allowed 
              players to escape the real world:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p class="normal">I think anyone that plays more than 20 hours a 
                week is addicted tho most would deny it. The sad truth is that 
                in many ways EQ is better than RL. It is easier to succeed in 
                EQ, I can be beautiful, fit and healthy in EQ - in real life I 
                am chronicly ill and there isn't much fun or achievement to be 
                had. EQ is more than just an opiate, and much more than just a 
                game. In a very real sense EQ gives me an opportunity to feel 
                free. [f, 36]</p>
              <p class="normal">I continued to play because I was also unhappy 
                with the circumstances in my real life and needed to &quot;forget&quot; 
                about it for as long as I could. I was having financial troubles 
                and marital problems as well. I could ignore my real life and 
                escape into eq. This wasnt for the fun, it was a &quot;need&quot; 
                that I felt to not deal with my life responsibly and eq was my 
                chosen method of &quot;druging&quot; myself into blissful ignorance. 
                [m, 33]</p>
              <p class="normal">Yes, I do consider myself addicted to it. I think 
                I am because I like hanging around with many people at a place 
                and doing something fun. Since EQ is half social and half an RPG, 
                that's the perfect enviroment for me. There's also no stress about 
                real life relationships while in EQ since they aren't real life. 
                I don't have to worry about that girl that I just bought a drink 
                for and if she thinks I'm &quot;cute&quot;, and I don't have to 
                worry about that random guy trying to start a fight with my friend. 
                In EQ, both situations can be just turned off; worries are gone, 
                and I continue with the fun I was having before. [m, 22]</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="normal">Other players talked about the friends and social 
              obligation factor:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p class="normal">I am an EQ addict. I play every day, only taking 
                a break when I get to a point where I have real life stress over 
                something that happens in game. When I do take breaks, it's usually 
                for only a day. I worry about my game life as much as I worry 
                about my real life. If I am late getting on, I feel like people 
                will be disappointed with me. As a guild leader, when conflicts 
                arise people come to me to resolve them. People look to you to 
                have events, help them get things, quest, etc. I have had people 
                in my own guild leave because they didn't feel we gave them enough 
                of our time or enough &quot;phat lewt&quot;. I try to please everyone, 
                but it is unrealistic to think you can be everywhere for everyone, 
                keeping them all happy. It gets to be a heavy burden to bear, 
                and sometimes I end up in tears out of frustration. I am an addict. 
                Will I quit? No. Why? Because I love it. =) [f, 30]</p>
              <p class="normal">I'm addicted to, so much as the interactioni between 
                friends that I have meet in game. I look forward to going home 
                after work and loging in to see haow every one is. Did they have 
                good a good day at work. Did there baby get over the colic problem. 
                It's like a small town...only you get to choose who you want to 
                be around. If I don't feel like being around a particular personality...I 
                just play a different character. But on the whole I see these 
                people as an extended family. Each one that leaves (and I've known 
                several) and never returns hurts as much as loosing a &quot;true&quot; 
                friend or loved one. I have tried quiting...and just limiting 
                my play. But when you progress in levels, and to group with verious 
                people you MUST level, it makes it difficult to just &quot;limit&quot; 
                your play time. I am currently looking at getting one character 
                high enough to go on a Dragon/Plains raid. After that I am going 
                to reconsider keeping my account open. [anon]</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="normal">Other players attributed it to the constant presence 
              of the &quot;next best thing&quot;:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p class="normal">The game is set up to make you want the next best 
                thing. &quot;Oh look what that guy has! How do I get that?&quot; 
                The answer is always to spend more time online either getting 
                higher level to go camp the item, or to just go camp the item 
                (or slight variation, camp the quest items that result in the 
                new item). But you are rewarded for playing more. Better items, 
                more freedom on where you can go. [m, 21]</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="normal">And players who do quit EQ may find themselves hooked 
              into playing again:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p class="normal">Every few months I get really bored. Im either 
                stuck in a nasty level and cant find something interesting to 
                camp/kill for good xp. Or maybe if Ive found it consistently hard 
                to find good groups. Sometimes its just cos Ive come across too 
                many kids playing EQ who have no sense of fair play and treating 
                people with respect and ruin my EQ experience. And I can only 
                ignore 20 people at a time dammit! :-p So I take a break - cold 
                turkey - and say I dont want to play EQ ever again. Of course 
                I always seem to come back after a month or so. Usually when Im 
                bored and have nothing better to do. But of course thats usually 
                all it takes...I get hooked back into the whole levelling and 
                exp junkie cycle. [f, 27]</p>
              <p class="normal">I had been playing EQ for about 2 months when 
                I began to realize the amount of time I was spending away from 
                reality and my obligations. I gradually weaned myself off EQ after 
                another 2 months. I haven't played EQ regularly for a few months 
                now. Although I have regained some control, I still feel serious 
                urges to play now and again. EQ has a very distinct society that 
                I found appealing. Everyone who played found something they liked 
                alot and just kept doing it. Repetition and social interaction 
                is what addicted me to EQ. I would wager to say that I am still 
                addicted even though I don't play for long stretches at a time. 
                EQ is highly addictive and quitting entirely is something VERY 
                difficult to do. After all, if you do quit... everything you worked 
                so hard for (your stats, equipment, friends) is gone forever since 
                characters are stored solely on the Verant servers. The only thing 
                you can take with you is the stories. And those anecdotes will 
                haunt you endlessly until you give in to the urge to re-immerse 
                yourself in Norrath just one more time. [m, 27]</p>

              <p><span class="normal">In a happy way, yes. :) It's true that I 
                would feel a lot of pain if I had to quit EverQuest...but I think 
                that far from being the &quot;menace&quot; that I've seen EQ addiction 
                made into, it's actually a lot more healthy than (for example) 
                people who come home in the evening and spend 4 or 5 hours watching 
                television. In EverQuest, I interact with people, do creative 
                things, think and strategize, and generally enjoy myself. I think 
                it's not much different than other forms of recreation with friends 
                and others. So no, I've never tried quitting. Why would I want 
                to? I enjoy spending time playing EverQuest, and I don't see it 
                as fundamentally unhealthy behavior. [f, 23]</span></p>
