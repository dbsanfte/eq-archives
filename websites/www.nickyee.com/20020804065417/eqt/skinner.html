            <p>
              <hr size="1">
            </p>
            <p class="normal">Almost everyone who has taken an introductory psychology 
              course in high school or college has heard of B.F. Skinner. Skinner 
              is an important figure in Behaviorism, and developed a learning 
              theory known as Operant Conditioning. Skinner claimed that the frequency 
              of a given behavior is directly linked to whether it is rewarded 
              or punished. If a behavior is rewarded, it is more likely to be 
              repeated. If it is punished, it becomes suppressed. This deceptively 
              simple and straight-forward theory may explain why EverQuest is 
              so addictive.</p>
            <p class="normal">The rewards cycle in EverQuest begins with instant 
              gratifications. When you start a new character, everything you need 
              to do is close by - finding the guildmaster; finding mobs to kill. 
              The first few mobs you attack die in several swings and you make 
              level 2 in about 5 kills. By the time you make level 3 half an hour 
              later, you are more aware of the underlying skill points, the accumulation 
              of money, and gain a desire to get better equipment. Gradually, 
              it takes longer and longer to get to the next level. The simple 
              tasks that you did to improve trade skills have become trivial, 
              but the rewards you get - the blue skill points and the metal bits 
              - drive you to perform tasks more elaborate than before because 
              trivial tasks are no longer rewarded. The one-click reward disappears, 
              and is gradually replaced by rewards that take more and more clicks 
              to get. And suddenly, some of us find ourselves clicking away for 
              hours in front of a forge or jewellery kit. </p>
            <p class="normal"> This process of guiding an individual to perform 
              more and more elaborate and complex tasks is known as shaping in 
              Operant Conditioning. It is usually explained in textbooks in conjunction 
              with Skinner Boxes. Skinner boxes are small glass or plexi-glass 
              boxes equipped with a combination of levers, food pellets, and drinking 
              tubes. Laboratory rats are placed into Skinner boxes and conditioned 
              to perform elaborate tasks. At first, the rat is rewarded with a 
              food pellet for facing the lever. Then it is rewarded if it gets 
              closer to the lever. Eventually, the rat is shaped to press the 
              lever. Once the rat learns that pressing the lever is rewarded, 
              a food pellet does not need to be dropped every time and the rat 
              will still continue pressing the lever. It is in the same way that 
              EverQuest shapes players to pursue more and more elaborate blacksmithing 
              or tailoring combinations. Moreover, EverQuest players continue 
              to attempt elaborate combinations in the face of many costly failures.</p>
            <p class="normal">There are several schedules of reinforcement that 
              can be used in Operant Conditioning. The most basic is a fixed interval 
              schedule, and the rat in the Skinner Box is rewarded every 5 minutes 
              regardless of whether it presses the lever. Unsurprisingly, this 
              method is not particularly effective. Another kind of reinforcement 
              schedule is the fixed ratio schedule, and the rat is rewarded every 
              time it presses the lever 5 times. This schedule is more effective 
              than the fixed interval schedule. The most effective method is a 
              random ratio schedule, and the rat is rewarded after it presses 
              the lever a random number of times. Because the rat cannot predict 
              precisely when it will be rewarded even though it knows it has to 
              press the lever to get food, the rat presses the lever more consistently 
              than in the other schedules. </p>
            <p class="normal">A random ratio schedule is also the one that EverQuest 
              uses. Both melee and trade skill points increase after a random 
              number of attempts. You know you won't get skill points unless you 
              practice the skill, but you don't know how many attempts it will 
              take to get another skill point. Level increases also take a random 
              number of kills. You know that you won't gain a level by standing 
              around, but you don't know exactly how many mobs you need to kill. 
              Because the time it takes to level can be estimated however, one 
              might argue that level increments follow a fixed ratio rather than 
              a random ratio schedule. It is the presence of experience penalties 
              from dying that randomizes this estimation, because it is hard to 
              estimate deaths. The ability for certain classes to use effective 
              strategies (druid quad-kiting for example) at certain levels also 
              means that a higher level may be completed in less time than the 
              level before it. Veteran players know that just because you can 
              get a bubble of experience in half an hour today doesn't mean you 
              can do it again tomorrow, because class demand and grouping conditions 
              change even in the same zone from day to day.</p>
            <p class="normal">A completely transparent experience points system 
              would be a fixed ratio schedule because you have a very good grasp 
              of how many more solo kills it takes to gain a level. Thus, if EverQuest 
              exposed the underlying numerical experience points and told you 
              how many points a mob gave you, and how much more experience you 
              need to gain a level, it would be less effective as a reinforcement 
              schedule. A system that can most effectively hint at progress without 
              sacrificing this opacity maximizes the random ratio schedule, and 
              this is why the recently implemented blue macro-view line in the 
              experience bar enhances the schedule already in place. This is particularly 
              true for mid-level players who would get frustrated by the normal 
              experience bar that moved too slowly, and thus made them feel that 
              progress was not being made.</p>
            <p class="normal">The presence of multi-layered and overlapping goals 
              in the game allow players to pursue multiple rewards concurrently. 
              You need more experience to gain levels so you can kill bigger creatures. 
              Along the way, you need more money to buy better equipment. You 
              may want to develop trade skills, complete quests, travel across 
              Norrath, or camp a rare spawn. Most of the time, you'll be doing 
              several of these at the same time. In fact, the game forces you 
              to. You can't keep up with mobs if you level but don't buy new gear. 
              You can't continue blacksmithing if you run out of money. What this 
              means is that you're always close to a goal - a reward. You are 
              seldom far away from all possible rewards. </p>
            <p class="normal">But something more intensely provoking has happened 
              in EverQuest which makes it addictive. Another frequently encountered 
              figure in introductory psychology textbooks is Maslow, known for 
              his proposed hierarchy of needs. Maslow sees human needs in a pyramid 
              scheme. At the bottom are basic hunger and thirst needs. Then follows 
              security. At the top of the pyramid are aesthetic needs and personal 
              achievements, which would only be possible on a strong foundation 
              of sated hunger and security needs. Thus, even though personal achievements 
              are more rewarding than filling an empty stomach, these achievements 
              are only possible once you've filled your stomach. But EverQuest 
              makes it possible for Joes and Janes to become heroes. EverQuest 
              makes it so that you can slay Vox in a guild raid on an empty stomach. 
              What happens when people can feel achievement through continuous 
              mouse-clicking? What happens when these achievements are more rewarding 
              than &quot;real life&quot; achievements? And what if it's easier 
              to click the mouse than to cook dinner? </p>
            <p class="normal">One important tenet of Operant Conditioning is that 
              behaviors are not inherently rewarding - they are made rewarding 
              through reinforcement. It is the shaping process in EverQuest that 
              makes the in-game &quot;achievements&quot; rewarding. It is the 
              shaping process that make &quot;achievements&quot; achievements. 
              People who don't play EQ don't see the appeal in clicking &quot;COMBINE&quot; 
              in front of a forge for hours. They don't see why players would 
              camp Quillmane or ice cougars for hours, even days, for an item 
              that usually doesn't drop. To outsiders, the time players spend 
              playing the game is mind-boggling. But it's hard for those of us 
              inside the construct to realize this because the game has conditioned 
              us to pursue these rewards.</p>
            <p class="normal">Many things set EverQuest apart from other available 
              computer games. Unlike other RPG's, there is no story-line or super-ordinate 
              goal. In fact, there really isn't even any kind of plot, which allows 
              the player to feel in control. Games like Diablo II give constant 
              instant gratification, and do not gradually take more and more time 
              to reach rewards. Game-play at level 25 in Diablo feels just like 
              game-play at level 10, whereas that is not the case in EverQuest. 
              No one would play Diablo if you needed to camp a mob that only sometimes 
              dropped an item. In fact, no one would play Diablo if you had to 
              wait for a mob to spawn. But what sets EverQuest apart is that it 
              is multi-layered and complicated in a way that few other games are. 
              Everything from trade skills to faction, from mobs to their loot, 
              from zones to planes, is complex and well-textured. Finally, it 
              is different because it is massively multi-player, but while most 
              multiplayer games are completely destructive, EverQuest has a decidedly 
              constructive and cooperative tone to it. There is no blood in the 
              game. No disemboweled intestines splatter on your screen. Instead, 
              players often find themselves chatting while waiting for a mob to 
              spawn. The ranger may be fletching as he recounts a particularly 
              close battle. The warrior chugs some Dwarven Ale. There may be some 
              emotes with playful, sexual overtones. In contrast with Quake or 
              Diablo, this scene feels awfully relaxed and idyllic. </p>
            <p class="normal">The massively-multiplayer nature of the game takes 
              the virtual construct one step beyond just an elaborate Skinner 
              Box. The problem with many people is that you can't have one box 
              tailored to all of their reinforcement needs. But having them all 
              in their separate Skinner Boxes is not interesting. The internet 
              solves this problem by allowing individually tailored Skinner Boxes 
              interact with others. And in this way, EverQuest has created a system 
              of inter-connected Skinner Boxes, a Skinner Network even, where 
              each Skinner Box is tailored to its host's needs and reinforcement 
              schedule, and where individuals can interact with each other without 
              sacrificing the integrity of their own construct. It is like the 
              Matrix where everyone is isolated in their own nutrient vat, but 
              where they can interact in a digitally-constructed world. </p>
