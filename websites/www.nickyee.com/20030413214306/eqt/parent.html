            <p class="header">Basics</p>
            <p class="normal">About 8.1% (N=898) of EQ players play the game with 
              a parent or child. In my sample of 51 EQ gamers who play with their 
              parent or child, 36 play the game with a child, while 15 play the 
              game with a parent. Most of these gamers have been playing the game 
              together for 5-20 months.</p>
            <p class="normal" align="center"><img src="graphs/image076.gif" v:shapes="_x0000_s1063"></p>
            <p class="normal">6 of these 51 players purchased EQ specifically 
              as something to do together. Most of these gamers are only sometimes 
              or seldom grouped with their parent or child.</p>
            <p class="normal" align="center"><img src="graphs/image078.gif" v:shapes="_x0000_s1067"></p>
            <hr size="1">
            <p class="normal"><span class="header">In Their Own Words</span></p>
            <p class="normal">In many cases, a parent started playing after watching 
              their child play, and tried playing for a bit:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p class="normal">It came to be because my mom and dad saw me and 
                my siblings playing, and decided to try it. They loved it, so 
                eventually bought another comp so we could group occaisionally. 
                I play side by side with the parent I live with, and still group 
                with my other parent in a different state. [f, 18]</p>
              <p class="normal">I am a soldier stationed in Germany. Last year 
                I bought EQ because my friends did, in that time my character 
                grew and became a guildleader. I would sometimes tell my dad about 
                EQ and things I have done, he became interested and bought it. 
                I created a second character so I could group with him from time 
                to time. He enjoys the game as much as I do and yes, he is in 
                my guild. [m, 24]</p>
              <p class="normal">Was my son's game and after complaing of how much 
                time he played he suggested I try it, ok well now I am hooked- 
                hehe went out and bought another account [f, 36]</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="normal">But it happens the other way too, and children often 
              get interested when they see their parents playing EverQuest:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p class="normal">Actually I use it as more of a learning tool, 
                my daughter is quite young, but fascinated by computers, and computer 
                art. She's four to be exact, and beginning to learn to read. We 
                probably only spend an hour or so each week playing her character. 
                The idea was both of ours actually, she wanted to &quot;pick a 
                face&quot; and I decided that we'd continue with the character. 
                [m, 28]</p>
              <p class="normal">My son harrassed me until I gave in. I never let 
                him out of my sight in game because I honestly feel he's still 
                too young and immature for the community. [f, 33]</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="normal">Playing EQ with a parent or child can enhance game-play:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p class="normal">Playing with my father makes me feel a little 
                safer, as his characters are higher level, and it makes me totally 
                at ease in my group. I thoroughly enjoy playing with him, I think 
                it is more fun than playing alone. [f, 14]</p>
              <p class="normal">I enjoy playing EQ with my daughter, and it has 
                helped her learn to spell better and to learn how to get along 
                with others. [f, 28]</p>
              <p class="normal">She see's things differently than i do and i find 
                that fun to see. [m, 29]</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="normal">On the other hand, it can make game-play difficult:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p class="normal">Definitely. Our character conflicts come out more. 
                It's a nightmare grouping with her, because the game scares her 
                and she doesn't want to take risks. It does NOT enhance it. [f, 
                28]</p>
              <p class="normal">My 6 year old always wanted to play. Since we 
                just had another child my wife isn't playing much right now. No. 
                She drives me crazy, so I don't play with her. [m, 34]</p>
              <p class="normal">Playing with him is difficult. Because he's not 
                a role-player like I am. He's there for the hack &amp; slash. 
                40 year olds, for the most part, can't conceive of the whole meaning 
                of RPG-type games. They grew up on pinball machines where score 
                was a factor. I grew up with AD&amp;D. Simple as that =) [m, 29]</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="normal">Some parents commented indirectly on how EQ adds 
              new meaning to parenting:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p class="normal">Yes, when,we are play togeather and fight (we 
                are both tanks ) and she is getting hurt it adds a little fear 
                to me even thiugh i know it is just a game her charcter is my 
                charcyers daughter in the game i still feel that protectiveness 
                over her. [m, 39]</p>
              <p class="normal">I have spent some time &quot;babysitting&quot; 
                his character until he was high enough level to group with me. 
                [m, 33] </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="normal">When asked whether they learned anything about their 
              parents from their game-play together, children often commented 
              on their parent's typing skills:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p class="normal">He can't type. [f, 14]</p>
              <p class="normal">I only found out how bad his typing skills actually 
                are [m, 16]</p>
              <p class="normal">I only learned that he doesn't pay quite as close 
                attention to detail as I do, but I didn't really expect that he'd 
                do so. [m, 14]</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="normal">When parents were asked the same question, some 
              talked about how the game made them aware of how much their children 
              know and understand:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p class="normal">She knows quite a bit more than I expected from 
                a four year old! [m, 28]</p>
              <p class="normal">It made me realize how much a 9 yr old child knows 
                and understands! [f, 28]</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="normal">Others commented that EQ allowed them to observe 
              their children in social situations that they usually had no access 
              to:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p class="normal">I get to see him interact with people. Most dont 
                realize who he is or our relationship. I see alot of myself in 
                the way he approches relationships. Makes me proud. [m, 38]</p>
              <p class="normal">I merely added depth and clarity to many traits 
                that I knew they had to see how they presented themselves in a 
                different environment. Since I am pretty much removed from their 
                circle of friends and can't watch them at school, EQ provides 
                a window into their behavoir outside of the house [f, 37]</p>
              <p class="normal">I found that my son handles himself in a very 
                mature manner. (He's 13 now). I have also been told by many other 
                players that know of our relationship how courteous and well spoken 
                he is. He understands that it is basically a game played by adults 
                for the most part and he manages to fit in very well. [m, 49]</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="normal">Some parents were pleasantly surprised at traits 
              or social skills they never knew their children had:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p class="normal">I learned that my son is a very good strategist. 
                I knew that to a degree before, but it has been eye opening to 
                watch him lead a group. I did not know he had these skills. [f, 
                49]</p>
              <p><span class="normal">He has a VERY good sense of humor. He can 
                and does know how to interact with others in a cooperative venture. 
                He also can be very giving and helpful when others seem to need 
                it. [m, 43]</span></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="normal">Both parents and children felt that playing EQ together 
              had enhanced their relationship. First it gave them something in 
              common to talk about, and thus more opportunities to talk:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p class="normal">Enhanced, we will spend hours talking about our 
                experiences and such. [m, 24]</p>
              <p class="normal">Enhanced. We talk tons more now, which is cool. 
                [m, 26]</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="normal">Parents commented on how EQ could be used as a teaching-medium:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p class="normal">It provides a common ground for talking, a way 
                I can give them &quot;gifts&quot; (in game) that I otherwise could 
                not afford to do, and a common basis for discussing real-life 
                issues, using illustrations I know they are familiar with. I have 
                found that they have learned many positive things from the game, 
                including dealing honorably with people, the importance of a good 
                reputation and leadership skills to name a few that come quickly 
                to mind. [f, 37]</p>
              <p class="normal">I like to think it enhances. I know I use it to 
                try and teach lessons I cant seem to in non fantasy settings. 
                Even when he is playing and I am not I tend to offer advice when 
                I think it is appropriate. It is also easier in EQ to let him 
                do the REALLY stupid stuff and hopefully learn from his mistakes. 
                [m, 43]</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="normal">But above all, many parents talked about how playing 
              the game together enhanced their relationship with their child by 
              taking them beyond the roles of parent and child:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p class="normal">Yes, playing EQ with my daughter has been very 
                enjoyable, and I have learned more about my daughters personality 
                as she treats me as a friend on EQ and not a parent. [f, 40]</p>
              <p class="normal">I think it has enhanced our relationship, we both 
                treat each other more like equals and partners in our private 
                life. It is much easier to talk to her now and I have found her 
                talking to me about much more of her life and ideas. [f, 40]</p>
              <p><span class="normal">No but it has shown my child that I`m ok 
                and has allowed us to bridge an age gap and we tend to talk more
