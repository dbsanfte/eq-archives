            <p class="header">Overview<a name="1"></a></p>
            <p class="normal">This project propelled itself in one-month cycles. 
              Each phase involved gathering both quantitative and qualitative 
              data pertaining to questions generated from the previous phase, 
              analyzing the data, and thengenerating new paths to explore in the 
              next phase. Each phase usually consisted of about 4 questionnaires 
              focused on different aspects of the game. Data from different phases 
              was linked using a participant's email address so that important 
              data, such as a participant's scores on a set of personality scale, 
              need only be gathered once. More importantly, data gathered separately 
              could be analyzed together. The resulting database of information 
              is useful because it allows access to both the big numerical picture 
              and individual qualitative responses. Participants were encouraged 
              to complete as many questionnaires as they felt comfortable doing, 
              and the underlying database structure was described to them briefly 
              so that they understood their continued participation was important. 
            </p>
            <hr size="1">
            <p class="header">Participant Recruitment<a name="2"></a></p>
            <p class="normal">Participants were recruited over the Internet for 
              this project. At the beginning of each phase, participants already 
              in the database were invited to participate in the new phase through 
              email. At the same time, a standardized message was posted in online 
              message boards and forums that are frequented by EverQuest players. 
            </p>
            <p class="normal">Participants were also encouraged to tell their 
              fellow EverQuest gamers about the project and to spread the link 
              to the project main page. It is not known however whether this helped 
              with recruitment significantly.</p>
            <p><span class="normal">This project collected data from 5 phases 
              in the period between September 5th 2000 and May 5th 2001. These 
              included 13 multiple-choice forms, 7 free-response forms, and 3 
              Flash-implemented experimental designs. Approximately 4000 individuals 
              participated in the study, and filled out about 25,000 forms altogether. 
              These estimates are generated after the exclusion criteria have 
              been applied. Most multiple-choice forms had at least 1500 responses. 
              There was a participant carry-over rate of about 25% from one phase 
              to the next.</span><br>

            <hr size="1">
            <p class="header">Exclusion Criteria<a name="3"></a></p>
            <p class="normal">Below are the criteria used for excluding submissions 
              from the analysis:</p>
            <p class="normal">--Blank submission<br>
              --Duplicated/Repeated submission, by comparing the email address 
              field <br>
              --Submission with missing email address field, even if all other 
              fields are completed<br>
              --Submission with more than 20% of fields left blank<br>
              --Submission with obviously impossible information, ie. age=2, email=anon@anon.com</p>
            <hr size="1">
            <p class="header"> On Representativeness<a name="4"></a></p>
            <p class="normal">Sampling biases and representativeness are important 
              issues to consider in any kind of empirical research. In the months 
              since the first release of this report, I have noticed concerns 
              about representativeness surfacing in several message boards which 
              linked to this study, and also in several email correspondences. 
              One individual presented a well-articulated critique of the representativeness 
              of my sample:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p class="normal">When referring to the results of your study, you 
                say &quot;x% of EQ players are &lt;blank&gt;&quot;. However, in 
                reading your methodology, I notice that your study does not choose 
                EQ players via a random sampling method. Instead, you primarily 
                rely on EQ websites and to a lesser extent word of mouth to find 
                your study's participants.<br>
                <br>
                It seems to me that this skews the data heavily in favor of the 
                most devoted EQ players. The casual EQ population who don't bother 
                to read EQ websites will be almost entirely overlooked in your 
                data, even though I'm sure they represent a significant portion 
                of the EQ population. Also, by using the volunteer method to get 
                your participants, you automatically filter out all the EQ players 
                who don't bother to fill out surveys. <br>
                <br>
                Thus I find it odd to derive from your study any implications 
                about the EQ populous as a whole. So the phrase &quot;x% of EQ 
                players&quot; simply doesn't apply; rather, your results reflect 
                &quot;x% of EQ players who read EQ websites and who like to fill 
                out surveys&quot;. There are probably some big differences between 
                those two statements.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="normal">I would answer this particular critique and similar 
              ones with the following arguments:</p>
            <p class="normal">1) EQ is one of the few games where going to these 
              websites will help a lot, to the extent where a lot of casual gamers 
              probably frequent these sites as well. For example, consider scheduled 
              server downtime, quest info, class strategies etc. So it's not clear 
              whether this creates a heavy skew at all. In fact, since playing 
              the game necessitates a connection to the Internet on a decent computer, 
              it is probably only a tiny percentage of players who have never 
              gone to an EQ website. <br>
              <br>
              2) Through a correspondence with Sony Online/Verant, I found that 
              my basic demographics match theirs very closely. For example, the 
              percentage of players who are female was 16% for both our data. 
              And average playtime per week was &quot;around 20&quot; for them 
              and mine was 22. <br>
              <br>
              3) Gender and age differences probably don't interact with whether 
              someone goes to an EQ website or not. So we know that female players 
              are more likely to feel that their EQ friendships are comparable 
              to their RL friendships, but this difference probably doesn't only 
              occur among people who go to EQ websites. And in a sense, these 
              age and gender differences are the more important part of the study.<br>
              <br>
              4) And the same for people who don't bother to fill out surveys. 
              They probably don't differ in important ways from people who fill 
              out surveys, in the sense that almost all of the findings would 
              remain the same even if we did somehow take them into account. </p>
            <p class="normal">5) Finally, since &quot;hours played per week&quot; 
              was one of the collected variables, I can check whether this impacts 
              the other variables I am measuring. So even if my sampling included 
              a very skewed proportion of heavily-devoted EQ players, I am not 
              oblivious to the effects of this skew. On the contrary, I have a 
              good way of determining how severe these effects are.</p>
            <p><span class="normal">In essence, I feel that most EQ gamers frequent 
              EQ websites, and that a non-random sampling of these gamers who 
              go to websites does a good enough, though clearly not perfect, job 
              of representing the entire EQ player population. And that while 
              slight skews do exist, that my findings would not differ significantly 
              from a study that was able to take random samples.</span> </p>
