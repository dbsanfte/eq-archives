              a significant effect (F[1,530]=4.75, p=.03), and it was found that 
              female characters received significantly more assistance than male 
              characters (Tukey HSD, Mmale=2.23, Mfemale=2.51, p=.003). It was 
              also found that female players offered significantly less assistance 
              to male characters than male players offered to female characters 
              (Tukey HSD, Mm-to-f=2.54, Mf-to-m=2.05, p=.03).</p>

            <p class="normal">While race of presented character did not produce 
              a significant effect, the analysis showed a possible trend in the 
              interaction effect (F[2,530]=2.20, p=.11). The female gnome received 
              significantly more assistance than the male gnome (Tukey HSD, Mmgnome=2.17, 
              Mfgnome=2.68, p=.03), and the female half-elf received more assistance 
              than the male half-elf (Tukey HSD, Mmhalfelf=2.08, Mfhalfelf=2.51, 
              p=.10), but the female ogre received almost exactly what the male 
              ogre received. In fact, the mean for the male ogre condition was 
              slightly higher than the female ogre condition (Tukey HSD, Mmogre=2.45, 
              Mfogre=2.36, p=.99).</p>
