            <p class=GaramondBody style='mso-list:none'><span class="normal">A 
              character in a MMORPG is a projection of the self. When an EverQuest 
              gamer plays the game, they are projecting a part of themself into 
              this virtual world. But a character, or an avatar, in such an environment 
              is an interesting combination of both illusion and reality, containing 
              elements of both “you” and “not you” at the same time. It is “you” 
              in the sense that your character speaks, reacts and acts in ways 
              that parallel how you might in real life. On the other hand, a character 
              is “not you” because none of us are really Wood-Elves or Necromancers 
              in real life. But because players spend a lot of time in developing 
              their characters and in building up their social networks, they 
              become personally invested in their characters. And when a player 
              is personally invested, every choice that they make within this 
              virtual construct is personally revealing. Thus, we would expect 
              that differences among individuals are also projected into EverQuest.</span></p>
            <p class=GaramondBody style='mso-list:none'><span class="normal"><o:p></o:p>We 
              could ask, for example, how gender is projected into EverQuest. 
              What differences in role-playing preferences or in-game behaviors 
              can we find between male and female players? Does EverQuest appeal 
              to male and female players in the same way? Do they continue to 
              play for the same reasons? Or do they get different things out of 
              playing the game? </span></p>
            <p class=GaramondBody style='mso-list:none'><span class="normal"><o:p></o:p>Demographically, 
              female players comprise 16% of the EverQuest player base. Female 
              players are significantly older than male players (<a href="demographics.html">link</a>). 
              </span></p>
            <p class=GaramondBody style='mso-list:none'><span class="normal"><o:p></o:p>There 
              are many ways we could begin to ask how male and female players 
              project themselves differently in EverQuest, but first we have to 
              establish that EverQuest provides room for variation. In EverQuest, 
              a gamer could choose to never communicate with anyone else. They 
              could play the game as if it were a single-player game. A gamer 
              could also choose to never kill a creature. Almost no one plays 
              at these extremes, but between these two extremes is room for variation. 
              It is the possibility of variation that makes it meaningful to ask 
              whether male and female players find the game appealing because 
              of different reasons.</span></p>
            <p class=GaramondBody style='mso-list:none'><span class="normal"><o:p></o:p>We 
              found that female players find the social interaction of the game 
              significantly more appealing than male players (<a href="metagame.html">link</a>). 
              Male players, on the other hand, are significantly more likely to 
              enjoy the sense of power the game gives (<a href="metagame.html">link</a>). 
              As several respondents commented,</span></p>
            <blockquote>
              <p><span class="normal"><o:p></o:p><i>He is really turned on by 
                the power and prestige aspects of the game, whereas I use it as 
                an extended chatroom. So we had some conflict over me getting 
                twinked out purely because I was a real woman. [f, 19, dating]</i></span></p>
              <p><i><span class="normal"><o:p></o:p>It's something we both enjoy, 
                but we tend to enjoy it seprately. I enjoy it because of the social 
                aspect, while he just enjoys the game itself. [f, 23, engaged]</span></i></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class=GaramondBody style='text-indent:0in'><span class="normal"><o:p></o:p>We 
              also found that female players are significantly more likely to 
              always group with people they’ve grouped with before when compared 
              with male players (<a href="ingame.html">link</a>). Male players, 
              on the other hand, are significantly more likely to have a goal 
              in mind when logging onto EQ when compared with female players (<a href="ingame.html">link</a>). 
              As an example,</span></p>
            <blockquote>
              <p><span class="normal"><o:p></o:p><i>For instance, I will rather 
                play in a group just for company, even if the exp gain is minimal, 
                whereas my partner tends to literally AVOID other players. [f, 
                23, engaged]</i></span></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class=GaramondBody style='mso-list:none'><span class="normal"><o:p></o:p>We 
              begin to get a sense that perhaps while female players play EverQuest 
              to build relationships, male players play EverQuest for achieving 
              goals. If this is the case, we would expect that female players 
              spend more time in both sustaining and participating in social groups 
              within EverQuest.</span></p>
            <p class=GaramondBody style='mso-list:none'><span class="normal"><o:p></o:p>Guilds 
              are one kind of sustained social network in EverQuest. When respondents 
              were asked to indicate whether they belonged to a guild, 80% of 
              respondents replied that they did belong to a guild (<a href="guilds.html">link</a>). 
              Male and female players are equally likely to belong to guilds. 
              Superficially, it appears that there is no gender difference in 
              participation in guilds, but if we look a little closer, we find 
              that this is not the case at all. Female players are significantly 
              more likely to be in officer or leader positions within guilds than 
              male players (<a href="guilds.html">link</a>). Female players are 
              also significantly more likely to participate in guild events than 
              male players (<a href="guilds.html">link</a>). Thus, it isn’t surprising 
              that female players find belonging to a guild significantly more 
              enjoyable than male players (<a href="guilds.html">link</a>).</span></p>
            <p class=GaramondBody style='mso-list:none'><span class="normal"><o:p></o:p>We 
              can refine what we’ve noted so far about gender differences. Perhaps 
              for female players, the focus of the game is in building relationships, 
              and killing mobs is something you can do while chatting, whereas 
              for the male players, the focus of the game is in killing mobs, 
              and chatting is something you have to do to coordinate battle plans. 
              Perhaps female players find social partners in EverQuest, while 
              male players find hunting partners. A set of findings support this 
              dichotomy.</span></p>
            <p class=GaramondBody style='mso-list:none'><span class="normal"><o:p></o:p>Respondents 
              were asked to indicate how appealing a set of hypothetical changes 
              to the game would be. Female players are significantly more likely 
              than male players to find enhanced emotes appealing (<a href="metagame.html">link</a>). 
              This is what we would expect because enhanced emotes make it easier 
              to develop social cohesion. Male players, on the other hand, are 
              significantly more likely than female players to find more weapon 
              and spell types appealing (<a href="metagame.html">link</a>). Having 
              more weapon and spell types is really having more ways to kill mobs, 
              and again this is what we might have expected.</span></p>
            <p class=GaramondBody style='mso-list:none'><span class="normal"><o:p></o:p>Because 
              female players focus on developing social relationships within EverQuest, 
              while male players do not necessarily care about building social 
              relationships, it is the female players who are more likely to make 
              friends in EverQuest. And we do find that female players are significantly 
              more likely than male players to feel that their EverQuest friendships 
              are better or comparable to their real-life friendships, while male 
              players are significantly more likely to feel their EverQuest friendships 
              do not come close to their real-life friendships (<a href="relate.html">link</a>).</span></p>
            <p class=GaramondBody style='mso-list:none'><span class="normal"><o:p></o:p>A 
              corollary of this is that because female players are making real 
              friends in EverQuest, and view EverQuest as a social community rather 
              than just a game, they are significantly more likely than male players 
              to feel that valuable things can be learned from EverQuest, as opposed 
              to male players who are significantly more likely than female players 
              to feel that very little of value can be learned from the game (<a href="metagame.html">link</a>).</span></p>
            <p class=GaramondBody style='mso-list:none'><span class="normal"><o:p></o:p>Because 
              male players play EverQuest to gain satisfaction from achieving 
              goals, we would expect that the ability to hack the game would be 
              more appealing to them. And indeed we do find that male players 
              are significantly more likely than female players to hack the game 
              if this were possible (<a href="metagame.html">link</a>).</span></p>
            <p class=GaramondBody style='mso-list:none'><span class="normal"><o:p></o:p>Female 
              players play EverQuest to build relationships and we have already 
              seen that they do develop meaningful friendships in the game comparable 
              to real-life friends. Female players also feel that valuable things 
              can be learned from EverQuest. In a very real sense, EverQuest is 
              not just a game to female players. To female players, EverQuest 
              is more relevant and meaningful than it is to the male players. 
              And the more relevant something is to an individual, the more likely 
              they are to dream about it. And we do find that female players are 
              significantly more likely to dream about EverQuest than male players 
              (<a href="whatabout.html">link</a>).</span></p>
            <p class=GaramondBody style='mso-list:none'><span class="normal"><o:p></o:p>Finally, 
              we can see this augmented relevance to female players revealed by 
              attachment to their characters. Respondents were asked whether they 
              would sell their main character at a price determined by their level. 
              We found that female players are significantly less willing to sell 
              their characters when compared with male players (<a href="whatabout.html">link</a>).</span></p>
            <p class=GaramondBody style='mso-list:none'><span class="normal"><o:p></o:p>Beyond 
              just personal investment and attachment, we can also look at emotional 
              investment. Because female players are interested in building relationships, 
              we would expect to find that they are more willing to emotionally 
              invest themselves in the game, while male players should be much 
              less willing to do so.</span></p>
            <p class=GaramondBody style='mso-list:none'><span class="normal"><o:p></o:p>In 
              a sense, this is already true going into the game. About 70% of 
              female players are playing EverQuest with a romantic partner (<a href="relate.html">link</a>). 
              But we could also look at falling in love and role-playing romantic 
              relationships within the game. And again we find that female players 
              are significantly more likely than male players to role-play romantic 
              relationships with another character or actually fall in love with 
              another character or player (<a href="relate.html">link</a>).</span></p>
            <p class=GaramondBody style='mso-list:none'><span class="normal"><o:p></o:p>Because 
              very few computer games have allowed female players to build relationships 
              the way that EverQuest has, it would be interesting to know whether 
              female players find the game more appealing than male players do. 
              We found that female players are significantly more likely than 
              male players to feel that EverQuest is the best computer game that 
              they have ever played (<a href="metagame.html">link</a>). </span></p>
            <p class=GaramondBody style='mso-list:none'><span class="normal"><o:p></o:p>This 
              question was also asked in a more refined way. A list of different 
              sources from which satisfaction could be achieved was generated, 
              and respondents were asked to indicate how much satisfaction they 
              got from each of the items. Female players, unsurprisingly, get 
              significantly more satisfaction from making friends. But we found 
              that female players also get significantly more satisfaction from 
              completing complex craft items and from completing a quest, both 
              of which are goal-oriented and which we might expect to appeal to 
              male players more. More surprisingly, we also found that female 
              players get more satisfaction from killing mobs than male players 
              do (<a href="metagame.html">link</a>). Although these findings seem 
              to contradict the model we have been trying to develop, this is 
              not necessarily the case. Female players generally do not like hack 
              and slash games, such as Quake, because it is all about goal-driven 
              achievement. EverQuest allows female players to build social relationships, 
              and crafting complex trade items or completing quests is something 
              they can do within the context of social relationships. So in a 
              sense, the satisfaction from sustaining social relationships spills 
              over into other areas. Female players are not just hunting mobs. 
              Female players are hunting mobs with their good friends, while male 
              players are more likely to be hunting with strangers. And it is 
              the nesting of one activity within a social relationship that makes 
              it more satisfying to female players than male players. </span></p>
            <p class=GaramondBody style='mso-list:none'><span class="normal"><o:p></o:p>In 
              conclusion, our findings allow us to build a cohesive model of how 
              gender projects into EverQuest. Female players tend to be socializers. 
              They play EverQuest to develop and sustain social relationships. 
              They are more likely to emotionally invest themselves into the game, 
              and are more likely to feel that their EverQuest relationships are 
              better or comparable to their real-life relationships. EverQuest 
              is more relevant and meaningful to female players and they are more 
              likely to feel that important things can be learned from playing 
              the game. Male players, on the other hand, tend to be achievers. 
              They play EverQuest to gain satisfaction from achieving goals. They 
              are much less likely to feel that their EverQuest friendships are 
              comparable to their real-life friendships. They are less likely 
              to emotionally invest themselves into EverQuest and are more likely 
              to feel that virtual romance is strange. Finally, male players are 
              more likely to feel that EverQuest is “just a game” and that nothing 
              important can be learned from it.</span></p>
