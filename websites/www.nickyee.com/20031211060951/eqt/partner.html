            <p class="normal">About 24.3% (N=1094) of EQ players play the game 
              with a romantic partner. There is a significant gender difference. 
              69.5% of female players play the game with a romantic partner, while 
              only 16.4% of male players do (p&lt;.001). Of those EQ players who 
              play the game with a romantic partner, about 43.8% (N=160) are dating. 
              38.1% are married, 14.4% are engaged, while 3.8% are lifetime partners.</p>

            <p class="normal">Oftentimes, one of the pair grew interested in the 
              game from watching the other play:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p class="normal">She became an Evercrack addict from watching me 
                play [m, 29, engaged]</p>
              <p class="normal">I had been playing EQ before, and I encouraged 
                her to start. (She's since levelled past me, the Ingrate! hehe) 
                We're separated geographically, so we can't play side by side. 
                [m, 34, dating]</p>
              <p class="normal">He brought home the game and played about a week 
                while I made fun of it. He started telling me about the people 
                he had met and it got me interested. I started playing soon there 
                after.. [f, 25, engaged]</p>
              <p class="normal">I bought EQ as a present for my fiance, he didn't 
                install the game for weeks after I bought it for him, so one day 
                I installed it and started playing. Next thing you know I'm going 
                into the other room going &quot;honey, help me......&quot;. Then 
                we started playing a character together one doing mouse controls 
                and the other the keyboard. Finally we had to buy a second copy 
                so we both could play. [f, 27, engaged]</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="normal">Sometimes, it was through some devious planning 
              or back-fires:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p class="normal">I intially started playing because i was trying 
                to prove a point how dreadful it was to sit and watch someone 
                play a game for hours at a time .. then i was hooked and we decided 
                together to both start playing together .. we started new characters 
                in the same starting spots and played .. we do not play side by 
                side [f, 24, dating]</p>
              <p class="normal">My boyfriend got me addicted to it on purpose...he 
                even upgraded my computer so that I could play with him. He figured 
                I would like it, because of my previous RPG stuff as a teen. We 
                currently have 4 duos, created specifically as partners. [f, 30, 
                dating]</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="normal">In fact, it can happen the other way around as well, 
              with the relationship beginning in EQ instead of real-life:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p class="normal">Actually we met in EQ in January, she was a level 
                22 ranger and I was a level 19 ranger. She powerlevelled me on 
                aviak guards in Lake Rathe. We weren't actually boyfriend/girlfriend 
                until this summer, and met in real life in August ;) [m, 20, dating]</p>
              <p class="normal">It happened quite as chance, we happened just 
                to see each other near the POD lift in Gfay, and started talking.. 
                eventually things became more involved... [m, 18, dating]</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="normal">Some gamers claimed that playing together was so 
              enjoyable that they would not play without their partner:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p class="normal">I wouldnt play without her. Having the bond she 
                and I share and having it come from a video game somewhat ties 
                us to the game itself, sort of like it is a substitute for &quot;our 
                song&quot;. [m, 20, dating]</p>
              <p class="normal">I also found that I didn't really feel like playing 
                unless she was there, it just wasn't the same. [m, 21, dating]</p>
              <p class="normal">As much as I love the game I could not imagine 
                playing without him now. [f, 35, dating]</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="normal">Others suggested that playing together enhanced 
              game-play:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p class="normal">EQ is a lot more fun with someone you can speak 
                to in the room. I have fun messing with my grilfriend in the game. 
                In a full group I sometimes give indications to what she's doing 
                before she gets a chance to (i.e. I'll say, &quot;inc&quot; when 
                she's pulling mobs. Its also nice to be able to look at another 
                monitor and get another view of the world. [m, 26, dating]</p>
              <p class="normal">it most definitely enhances the enjoyment. we 
                are able to use our characters to be a bit more &quot;open&quot; 
                to one another in the company of others and gain reactions that 
                may otherwise be looked at as inappropraite in public places. 
                this falls along the lines of a fantasy cyber-date where you can 
                step out of one role and into another. [m, 29, dating]</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="normal">Many gamers however, talked about the tensions playing 
              together would create, and how playing together could actually make 
              game-play difficult:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p class="normal">Sometimes it's great... he's protective over me 
                and looks after me online. Often he'll sacrifice his character's 
                life for mine so that I will be safe, not lose experience, etc. 
                When we're having a good time, obviously, it's great. There are 
                times though, that it's miserable. He can get VERY jealous over 
                who my characters talk to and heaven forbid some compliment me. 
                It's tidious sometimes and it makes me wish we didn't play together. 
                [f, 20, engaged]</p>
              <p class="normal">I can't stand to watch her play. I want her to 
                do things my way and she does them her way and we just clash when 
                we play together. [m, 25, engaged]</p>
              <p class="normal">However, our styles are totally different. For 
                instance, I will rather play in a group just for company, even 
                if the exp gain is minimal, whereas my partner tends to literally 
                AVOID other players. I am often a pushy roleplayer, forcing others 
                to RP or get out of my face. Thus I am unafraid of starting an 
                argument, whether in /say, /tell or even /shout. This seems to 
                make my partner very uncomfortable. For these reasons, if we are 
                playing together we try very hard to compromise. However, I insist 
                on having 'solo' characters that I only play on my own. I tend 
                to find his gaming style restrictive. [f, 23, engaged]</p>
              <p class="normal">My characters are flirtatious.. I am more outgoing 
                and sexual online; it's just a function of not being face to face 
                with people. He had to deal with jealousy problems from the attention 
                I receive, and I had to learn that I can't act how I usually do. 
                We hardly play at all anymore, and it's really helped our relationship. 
                [f, 19, dating]</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="normal">When asked whether they had learned anything about 
              their partner because of playing together in EQ, most respondents 
              thought that EQ highlighted the best and worst in their partners:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p class="normal">I learned that he really does nothing without 
                a purpose, even in playing a game. He's extremely goal-oriented 
                - likes to see that gold experience bar move, where I'm not quite 
                as experience obsessed as he is. [f, 25, engaged]</p>
              <p class="normal">Well....I see her best and worst traits in the 
                game. She has a terrible temper that comes out in the game at 
                times. [m, 30, dating]</p>
              <p class="normal">I realized, in game and in RL, just how nice, 
                fair minded, and honorable he is. [f, 30, dating]</p>
              <p class="normal">Not really but everything comes out of the woodwork 
                if you will. What I mean by this is, take the following instance 
                as an example. My g/f is scared of trying new things and when 
                she does it takes her a while to warm up to whatever she's doing. 
                This REALLY shows itself in the game as her not wanting to attack 
                anything she's not comfortable with. I'm not talking about a normal 
                situation where the mob would con red/yellow/white to you but 
                I'm talking about because that mob &quot;LOOKS&quot; bad (even 
                if it's green or blue) she will not go near it. Frustrating but 
                that's not the point ... the point is that the fear of things 
                new comes out in the game and you can really see it more clearly 
                in the game than in RL (I mean how many Orc Centurions do you 
                know that are running around in RL?). [m, 24, dating]</p>
              <p class="normal">No. We know each other well IRL. The only thing 
                that EQ has done is affirmed my feelings about my wife's personality,

            <p class="normal">Sometimes, respondents reflected on how playing 
              together highlighted their individual differences:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p class="normal">I was not aware how shy he is of speaking out 
                'in public' (in EQ, this translates into /shout or /ooc, of course). 
                He will often scorn me for getting involved into a public channel 
                discussion or try and stop me. [f, 23, engaged]</p>
              <p class="normal">Yeah, he's a real risk-taker in the game, much 
                more so than in actual life. I'm the opposite. Also, he starts 
                conversations with others much more easily than in EQ than in 
                RL. Again, I'm the opposite. [f, 37, dating]</p>
              <p class="normal">Not really. It did further emphasize that she 
                is a much more socialable person than am I, as she tends to make 
                more friends in the game than I do, but I was pretty much aware 
                of that beforehand. [m, 30, married]</p>
              <p class="normal">I'm not sure. That's really a tough question. 
                I would say rather than having learned something new about him, 
                it was more like it emphasied differences between us that I already 
                knew about. He is very patient, I am very impulsive, etc. And 
                these differences are a lot more apparent in a game situation.

            <p class="normal">Gamers sometimes commented indirectly on how differently 
              men and women approach the game itself:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p class="normal">He is really turned on by the power and prestige 
                aspects of the game, whereas I use it as an extended chatroom. 
                So we had some conflict over me getting twinked out purely because 
                I was a real woman. (His main is a female, which was also something 
                new. I didn't appreciate not being able to be his girlfriend in 
                game to, or that in order to be so I would have to become a lesbian. 
                I also had to accept that his playing female characters was a 
                roleplaying decision, and I still think that it is a little strange.) 
                [f, 19, dating]</p>
              <p class="normal">I didn't realize quite how obsessive he was. . 
                .I try to moderate my EQ time, I don't like to play more than 
                a few hours a day, and when I go on raids or spend 8+ hourse playing, 
                I nearly never play the next day. My husband's played for 30+ 
                hours straight. [f, 22, married]</p>
              <p class="normal">However, our styles are totally different. For 
                instance, I will rather play in a group just for company, even 
                if the exp gain is minimal, whereas my partner tends to literally 
                AVOID other players. [f, 23, engaged]</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="normal">Several female respondents commented on the over-protectiveness 
              of their partners:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p class="normal">Oh yes, One of the main reasons i have begun to 
                lose interest in him, was from the way he would always take kills 
                from me, and shielding me so as to keep me safe... Well With him 
                being a wizard and me a cleric, we all know i can whoop his butt 
                :) So knowing this i observed when we hung out in real life next, 
                and sure enough he is Way too overprotective and jealous. I never 
                noticed it until the game tho. [f, 24, dating]</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="normal">Respondents had very varied feelings as to whether 
              EQ had enhanced or damaged their relationships. Some felt that EQ 
              had taken over their relationship:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p class="normal">Damaged. We spend too much time back to back at 
                our computers typing away and sharing time and experiences with 
                our friends in Norrath. And because EQ is so demanding of time 
                in order to keep up with those friends, each of us has dedicated 
                literally MONTHS of time to a rediculous game that neither of 
                us will stop playing right now but both wish we would. [f, 23, 
                married]</p>
              <p class="normal">Well, I think we sometimes play EQ instead of 
                being close to one another physically (not necessarily intimate, 
                but that too). I don't think that's good. [m, 30, married]</p>
              <p class="normal">When you stick two people in a room who are complete 
                addicts to this game...let's just say that neither of us has the 
                will to function in RL anymore, and neither of us is strong enough 
                to attempt to end the addiction for both of us. Our addiction 
                feeds on us, we feed on it and we feed on each other's. [f, 24, 
                dating]</p>
              <p class="normal">Both. We have common ground, as mentioned above, 
                but she likes the game too much. She plays it too much! We don't 
                do anything else, it seems. When we go out, she gets bored and 
                says how she would rather be playing EQ. Our social life has dropped 
                significantly. [m, 30, dating]</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="normal">On the other hand, other gamers talked about how 
              EQ made it easier for them to resolve real-life communication issues, 
              and enhanced the relationship:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p class="normal">I think it has enhanced the relationship. He and 
                I both tend to hold in emotions and thoughts, but when we are 
                in game we can comfortably let the other know thru emotes and 
                such. [f, 28, engaged]</p>
              <p class="normal">If anything it has enhanced the relationship. 
                Before we had problems with communication. Through Everquest we 
                have learned to communicate or suffer the consequences, which 
                are quite &quot;visible&quot; where as not communicating with 
                my partner caused unseen damages. [m, 17, dating]</p>
              <p class="normal">It's meant we can explore changing roles (for 
                example my being group leader, whereas in our day-to-day lives 
                he is more often in charge of the people around us (his employees) 
                than I am) and also given us something fun to do together. [f, 
                32, dating]</p>
              <p><span class="normal">Our relationship has definately been enhanced. 
                We're better now at working together towards goals. And we both 
                really enjoy growing, learning and adventuring together. It's 
                exciting to be involved in each other's triumphs. And it feels 
                good to help each other (sometimes it seems like a race to see 
                which one of us can save the other). [f, 29, married]</span> </p>
