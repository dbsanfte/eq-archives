            <p class="normal">In a Flash-implemented experimental design that 
              manipulated the direction of gender-bending (male-to-female/female-to-male), 
              EQ players were randomly assigned into 2 conditions:</p>
            <p class="normal"><i>1) &quot;You've adventured and become quite friendly 
              with a male character. One day, the character tells you that she 
              is female in real life. How much does this bother you?&quot;<br>
              2) &quot;You've adventured and become quite friendly with a female 
              character. One day, the character tells you that he is male in real 
              life. How much does this bother you?&quot;</i></p>
            <p class="normal">Participants were asked to rate on a 5 point scale 
              how much this bothered them, ranging from &quot;Not At All&quot; 
              (1) to &quot;A Lot&quot; (5). There was a significant effect between 
              the genders of the participants (F[1,666]=5.83, p=.01), and it was 
              found that female EQ players were significantly more bothered by 
              gender-bending than male EQ players were (Tukey HSD, Mmale(584)=1.64, 
              Mfemale(86)=1.89, p=.01). The direction of the gender-bending also 
              produced a significant effect (F[1,666]=5.38, p=.02), and it was 
              found that male-to-female gender-bending was significantly more 
              troubling than female-to-male gender-bending (Tukey HSD, Mm-to-f(317)=1.89, 
              Mf-to-m(353)=1.64, p&lt;.001). There was also an interaction effect 
              between gender of participant and direction of gender-bending (F[1,666]=15.29, 
              p&lt;.001). In particular, it was found that male players found 
              female-to-male gender-bending significantly less troubling than 
              the other 3 combinations.</p>

            <p class="normal">We know that about 16% of EQ players are female 
              and 84% are male (N=1240). Given a hypothetical pool of 1000 EQ 
              players, 160 are female and 840 are male. </p>
            <p class="normal">About 47.9% of male players have a character of 
              the opposite gender (N=1025), and about 23.3% of female players 
              have a character of the opposite gender (N=189). Thus, in our hypothetical 
              population:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p class="normal">Of 840 male players, 402 have female characters, 
                438 do not.<br>
                Of 160 female players, 37 have male characters, 123 do not.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="normal">Of players who have characters of the opposite gender, 
              male players use a female character about 35.3% of the time (N=275), 
              and female players use a male character about 14.2% of the time 
              (N=51). So, at any given time in our hypothetical pool:</p>
            <p class="normal">Of 840 male players:<br>
            </p>
            <blockquote>

                a female character, while 260 are using a male character.<br>
                438 do not have female characters, and thus 438 are using male 
                characters.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="normal">Of 160 female players:<br>

                that is why I chose the female gender. The male graphics for some 
                races just looks generic, and bland. [m, 22]</p>

                because the thought of a ass kicking female sounded fun. I played 
                her until 27 and lost interest in the class. She was a wood-elf

              <p class="normal">Personally, you recieve a LOT more stuff when 
                you start out as a female. Take my Barb Shammy for example. I

                up to me and says &quot; Hmmm Looks like you are looking for some 
                new stuff &quot; So he takes me into Halas and buys all Large 
                Leather or better, and all my spells for lvls 1 and 4. Theres 
                no contest that female characters get a lot more help. I help 
                them too, though not as much because it is somtimes obvious that

              <p class="normal">Roleplaying, mostly. I wanted to try something 
                different. So when the iksar race came out, I didn't like how 
                the females looked, and decided to finally try making a male character, 
                to try roleplaying a male and to see how I was treated as well. 
                After making my first male character, the two characters I have

              <p class="normal">I find a roleplaying experience (which is what 
                EQ is to me) to be much more enjoyable when you are roleplaying 
                someone that isn't very much like yourself--having a character 
                of the opposite just happens to be one of many ways to create 
                a character that is vastly different than yourself. [m, 14]</p>
              <p class="normal">My other character is an enchantress, rather than 
                an enchanter, for 3 reasons: 1) I see an enchanter/enchantress 
                as more of a feminine character, from other gaming such as AD&amp;D 
                and Magic: the Gathering, and my own personal ideas. 2) Female 
                characters can get better prices when selling, since my enchantress 
                is also a jewelcrafter...:) 3) Since the character is on a 2nd 
                account, i enjoy the roleplaying i can produce from both characters.

              <p class="normal">I created a male character strictly for the purpose 
                of getting completely away from everything. It is the last place 
                anyone would think to look for me. There are also times when I

                When I play my male characters, other male members of the party 
                will listen to me better, take me more seriously. In my male form 
                I could give orders and have them listened to, where as a female, 
                my characters aren't always taken quite as seriously. Also, where 
                my female characters were gifted many things when they were young 
                and naked by random players, I didn't see it happening with my 
                males, which I didn't mind at all. I've enjoyed the higher level 
                of &quot;respect&quot; for my abilities that seems to come with 
                playing in a male body. [f, 22]</p>

                I was playing my male paladin and trying to be the group tank. 
                I was pulling the mobs too ( in a rather dangerous zone). After 
                a while, a conversation about our home lives started and I made 
                a comment about my husband. Immediately the guys in the group 
                asked me if I was really female in RL. When I confirmed it they 
                started sending out another male character to pull the mobs. I 
                found the whole group suddenly expecting me to do less melee. 
                I'm not sure if they became protective of me or if they just assumed 
                that a female would be less capable in the role of a tank. [f,

              <p class="normal">When I'm playing a male character, I get a lot

                for the first time in my life. Always before I have focused on 
                the lack of respect, the expectation of lower quality work from 
                women, and felt that being a woman i was automatically disrespected. 
                In eq, i can plainly see that i am respected just for being a 
                woman, and can now see how in rl, that happens too. That both 
                viewpoints occur. Somehow, I am able to look at this mess of contradictions 
                and value myself more. That I am a lot more sexual than I have 
                thought of myself in the last few years. That being a woman can
