            <p class="normal"><span class="normal">When asked whether they have 
              changed or grown from playing the game, most respondents replied 
              that EQ was &quot;just a game&quot; and that people don't learn 
              anything from it:</span></p>
            <blockquote>
              <p class="normal">No change. Simply play for entertainment and social 
                value. [m, 30]</p>
              <p class="normal">No, it hasn't really had any kind of impact on 
                me. It's just a game. [m, 23]</p>
              <p class="normal">This is just a video game to me. I don't analyze 
                it to that extreme, only use it as an escape from the stresses 
                of RL for awhile. [m, 27]</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="normal">But not all players thought that EQ was &quot;just 
              a game&quot;. Some respondents found themselves interacting with 
              people differently outside of EQ:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p class="normal">It didnt change my thinking, it did however change 
                to a minor extent my acting in real life. I have found it easier 
                to share and confront other people with my thoughts...whether 
                this is due to EQ or just me growing emotionally I am not quite 
                sure off though. A very positive change indeed [m, 30]</p>
              <p class="normal">I believe I have matured in my interaction with 
                other people. When I first began playing I was rather hot-headed 
                and impatient. I've been playing over a year and I think I've 
                become more understanding of other people and their points of 
                view. [m, 19]</p>
              <p><span class="normal">Erm, good question. I tend to put a lot 
                more belief in real life experiences contributing to personal 
                growth, but I don't see why a game can't help you grow in addition 
                to RL. I've learned to be a bit more tolerant, I think. I used 
                to get really upset at folks for doing something stupid and getting 
                us all killed, for instance, but again... it's a game and EVERYONE 
                makes mistakes. Mostly, it's reinforced a lot of things I knew 
                already, but sometimes let slip by... like the fact that just 
                because someone doesn't do something MY way doesn't mean it's 
                the wrong way. ;) [f, 30] </span> </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="normal">Some players felt that they had grown as a person 
              from playing EQ:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p class="normal">Yes, I have learned to deal with more varied personalities 
                and have developed leadership qualities that I lacked before. 
                [f, 33]</p>
              <p class="normal">Sure have. There is no better confidence builder 
                than keeping your group alive or helping a frustrated player regain 
                his corpse. You may be a lowly cashier or a bored house wife but 
                in Norrath you can be something more that you might never achieve 
                in RL. [f, 33]</p>
              <p class="normal">Yes. I think that it has given me a more big-picture 
                type sense of the world. Things make sense when I associate them 
                with other things, and I think about things differently now. [m, 
                14]</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="normal">Several players commented on gaining a better understanding 
              of group dynamics and leadership:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p class="normal">I think forming a group in EQ is one of the most 
                powerful elements in the game and has shown me a lot about myself 
                and others. Throw 6 strangers together each with different class 
                strengths and weaknesses, all trying to accomplish a common goal 
                together, and you learn a lot about people. I can see what happens 
                when communcation doesn't happen and its helped me try to communicate 
                with people more in real life. [m, 30]</p>
              <p class="normal">Definatly, I have become more outgoing, more of 
                a leader-oriented person In RL as opposed to the quiet person 
                who contributed only when asked. [m, 18]</p>
              <p class="normal">Yes - I've learned a bit more about teamwork, 
                and how to execute it. Everyone has their place, and everyone 
                works together for the good of the whole. [m, 14]</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="normal">Many players felt that the biggest problem EQ had 
              introduced was the amount of time it consumed:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p class="normal">Sometimes I play too much and forget to do things 
                in real life or hold up my responsibilities. Other times I get 
                burned out on EQ and I don't play very much. It goes back and 
                forth. [m, 30]</p>
              <p class="normal">It's been a bit of a time sink, but I've been 
                able to work around it for the most part. The main victim of the 
                time I spend on EQ has been other leisure activities such as other 
                computer games and reading magazines. Sleep has occassionally 
                been sacrificed, but never more than a couple of hours' worth 
                at a time. [m, 23]</p>
              <p class="normal">Yes, it causes problems, it sucks up all my free 
                time! Hehe. :) [f, 21]</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="normal">Several players even used the word &quot;addiction&quot; 
              to describe their attachment to EQ:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p class="normal">Sometimes yes, It is very easy to get addicted 
                and get your priorities out of whack with EQ. You would rather 
                come home and play EQ than do what needs to be done. [f, 22]</p>
              <p class="normal">EQ has deepened my probelms in life because Eq 
                is an addiction.Once you start, and play for a while it is extremely 
                difficult to sever the link to EQ.I find myself, every free minute 
                of the day, playing EQ or looking at EQ websites. [m, 15]</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="normal">Players who were in a romantic relationship often 
              cited the strains EQ brought into the relationship:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p class="normal">Yeah -- my soon-to-be ex-wife has an extreme aversion 
                to any kind of computer game. EQ (or my playing it) was just one 
                more nail in the coffin of our union. [m, 40]</p>
              <p class="normal">Sometimes EQ has made problems in my relationship 
                with my fiance. I play mostly at night, when he is at work. But 
                he gets upset when he gets home, and I play for another 4 hours 
                or so, because &quot;we just started this raid, and I just HAVE 
                to be here for it&quot;. Eq is a game you just can't sit down 
                and play for an hour. Once you get involved in something, it's 
                hard to just log off. Sometimes I play to much, and I have had 
                to regulate myself from spending too much time playing. [f, 21]</p>
              <p class="normal">yes, it drew me into the cpu game more than my 
                real life... i wanted to spend more time online than i did with 
                my RL girlfriend [m, 27]</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="normal">When asked whether they have ever had any emotionally 
              moving experiences in EQ, many players talked about the altruism 
              they had experienced in the game:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p class="normal">I remember one instance in particular when I had 
                just got level 51 (the guy referenced knew this), our group had 
                a bad pull and then I started getting hit hard-- this guy took 
                the monster off me, moved it away and died, allowing me and my 
                other friend to escape (evac). I was emotionally moved that he 
                did this for me, If i remember correctly i think i even shed a 
                tear it was so moving (seriously)-- I worked to be sure he got 
                a Ressurection and I thanked him for his heroic deed! [m, 17]</p>
              <p class="normal">I came across a Barbarian character who was struck 
                down by a gnoll. He lay there bleeding about to die. Luckily I 
                had bandages on me and knelt down and brought him back to life. 
                This was a strange thing on a racewar server as I was playing 
                a High-elf and we are considered enemies. He was very amazed and 
                thanked me over and over. I felt very moved. [m, 30]</p>
              <p class="normal">Maybe. I have had a friend once in a group sacrificie 
                himself once (basically the whole group was in a bad situation, 
                so he basically told everyone to run, while he taunted and got 
                all the monsters to aggro on him, giving us time to get away). 
                This was particularly poignant as I know my friend doesn't have 
                but a few hours a week to play, and thus a death would be a loss 
                of a weeks worth of playing time...[m, 29]</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="normal">Some players talked about friendships that developed 
              in EQ:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p class="normal">Yes, Im very close to several people on EQ and 
                treat them as very good friends. When some of them have problems, 
                they can talk to me and I take it seriously, as they will speak 
                to me about real problems and not just the &quot;game&quot;. [f, 
                22]</p>
              <p class="normal">Yes! Several! Mostly finding out during times 
                of feeling down over my RL that I am important to my close friends 
                on EQ who have stood by me offering every kind of support imaginable!!! 
                [f, 49]</p>
              <p class="normal">Yes. When the Test server was deleted I lost the 
                interstion with friends in game and the character I had. I didn't 
                realize the ties I had to those pixels before. After that, I learned 
                to play more for the moment, since it could end again at any time. 
                Luckily, my friends came back. The pixels dno't really matter 
                =( [m, 28]</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="normal">Other players described experiences of frustration 
              and anguish:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p class="normal">If you mean total anguish as I LDd during a battle 
                or got caught in an event as a newbie and got ripped apart eight 
                successive times at my bind point by a 30th level necromancer, 
                then sure. Otherwise, no. [m, 30]</p>
              <p class="normal">Hmmm, if you count the time when I screamed at 
                the computer screen when I went linkdead in the middle of an important 
                fight, I guess that would be the most emotional I have ever gotten! 
                ;) [f, 21]</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="normal">When respondents were asked to comment on whether 
              nothing pertaining to the real world can be learned from the game 
              because it is all fake, most players argued passionately that this 
              was not the case:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p class="normal">The game is fake of course. Were only looking 
                at our computer screens and pixels. But the people playing it 
                are real. With real feelings, emotions, and desires. The actions 
                I do and things I say make a difference as people remember and 
                form opinions about myself. Once a high level character cast a 
                bunch of super buff spells on me and said &quot;soandso said you 
                were a really nice person.&quot; and I had never met her before. 
                I thanked her and felt good. [m, 30]</p>
              <p class="normal">I think that whenever you have the oportunity 
                to interact with other people, you have the opportunity to learn 
                something. Everyone has something to teach you, be it online or 
                in person. Afterall, you learn from what someone writes in a book, 
                and you don't meet with the person in the flesh. Why would online 
                be any different? With as many people you interact with in EQ, 
                how can you not atleast learn something? That I think is the reason 
                I have played EQ, the people that I meet. [f, 21]</p>
              <p class="normal">I think any time kids get into environments where 
                they can &quot;try out&quot; personalities and interact in a social 
                environment they learn. I think your ability to &quot;learn&quot; 
                from EQ is a factor of your age and emotional maturity. The younger 
                you are, the greater the chance of learning. [m, 37]</p>
              <p class="normal">I think this is proposterous, Norrath is a world 
                with real consequences such as being an outcast, and very realistic 
                rewards like always being asked to group, it is very much lifelike. 
                If you learn nothing else, you will probably learn soon enough 
                how to get along with others, like it or not. [m, 16]</p>
              <p><span class="normal">I think they are wrong, in every aspect. 
                Are the people playing it fake? Hell no, and therefore everything 
                you say and hear is real, they are saying it, and you are hearing 
                it just like what would happen in RL. And sometimes it can be 
                easier to say things online rather than in person. Many things 
                can be learned about people through EQ. [m, 17]<br>
