<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I want to get an idea if the SK community at large functions as a part of their guild's pull team either as their primary, secondary or tertiary raid functions. I have some ideas for helping us in the pulling area that would cross over to helping us tank better as well, but I don't want to put them forward if most of you don't pull. The reason I ask in a raid environment is that we all pull in single group content, and any benefits we see to pulling on raids will trickle down to six man pulling as well.<br />
<br />
Since gates, and to some extent in PoP and LDoN (raid content), our guild's use of SK's as pullers has increased dramatically (and this is the case for Brael and some others as well). Currently I find my main raid role to be equally pulling and off tanking, with more pulling than off tanking lately. My third job is dps on boss fights, and mana regen with the two Z Bites.<br />
<br />
There are other classes that are more efficient pullers, but SK's can do some things that other pull classes cannot, and we can be very good pullers with a bit of practice and experience.<br />
<br />
Issues: Splitting mobs is not the main problem, we have a lot of tools in that regard, although we can always use something to make us be more efficient. Surviving the raw dps of a long or complicated pull, and staying FD through being cast on are the biggest concerns for me atm.<br />
<br />
Your comments on your role (or lack there of) and the issues you face?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">New players of other classes have no idea how good SK's are at pulling.  I often wait for the main puller to need to rest, regen, med, whatever then take over.  You've listed the only non-player issues I've run in to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sadly I haven't pulled for a raid since NToV. Mainly use Monks and Rogues to pull.<br />
<br />
Main role has offtanking and just DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>signa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, our guild uses whats called 'motrains' which is when our guild leader, who is a warrior, runs off and comes back and trains us. Works really well when you want to get through uqua as quickly as possible =x<br />
<br />
As far as my personal pulling, its probably 70/30 offtanking vs. pulling. Since im a newer member typically I'm behind my CC when it comes to pulling something. If we aren't getting intentionally trained, it goes monks then sks as far as pulling. We're very dicked over for bards at the moment.<br />
<br />
My concerns for pulling in gates are the snare immune mobs, and the amount you'll get casted on after a feign. I havn' trained pet discipline yet, so I really don't pet pull. I'm not sure how effective that would even be with mobs hitting so hard and movng as fast as they do. The runspeed immunity means two things for me, first that I won't be able to split them easily with festering. Second, that the fucker is gonna run at me fast. After that I just need to try and get down before it becomes a fight to channel death peace. <br />
<br />
The issue of spells landing after you're down is also a big one. If you're trying to split and theres a caster involved, yes you can do your best to block line of sight but thats not helping initially. If you have to wait for him to cast before you can get down, you can bet all his little friends will already be all over your ass.<br />
<br />
In short, I do get used as a puller. I like to pull as much as I like to offtank. Its part of the versatility of the class that I enjoy. I've never spent much time around other SKs as I've only been in 3 guilds and ive been the only, or one of very few SKs in them, so my knowledge of the best routes to pull is basically limited to my own experience. However these are the issues as I see it: disabling of snare, spells landing when you're feigned, and being able to channel death peace through the melee of newer mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">In my guild as a whole, SKs have always had a large role in pulling, kiting, and parking mobs. With so many encounters in which adds are a major factor, SKs are an enourmous asset.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>VengerMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i rarely if ever get asked to pull a raid.  our guild is in love with Bards to the point  that the Monks almost get benched.<br />
<br />
i spend the majority of my time off-tanking, or providing a watch for the casters in case of overnuke, etc.  basically my guild has absolutely no clue what SK's are capable of doing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nathus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I used to be one of the 2 main pullers for my guild 2.5 years ago.  Took a year and a half break, came back and in the last 7 months I think there's been 2 raids where sk's have pulled, neither of which I pulled. We use bards primary, monks secondary, and occaisionally rogues on certain pulls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ashrai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">In the raiding alliance I was in before this guild, by the end I was being used on almost every raid either working in tandem with the monk or just pulling on my own. Granted we weren't doing GoD, so my raid pulling was limited to PoP raids like RZtW, Bert, etc...PoFire minis, a lot of Sol Ro Tower, PoE Rings, etc.  However I always had HS memmed so got used a lot on the oh shit/suicide areas where something needed to be distracted for a bit (Agnarr's buddy, etc)<br />
<br />
<br />
Currently the guild I am in uses monks pretty much 99% of the time, our monks are great and have been pulling for the guild since the old days.  So while we don't use SKs, the SKs end up with a lot to do since the monks like to bring us lots of mobs to play with and offtank.  Pulls that are tricky for monks, we use rogues.  <br />
<br />
In GoD, the arguement against using an SK to pull either on small raids or even in exp groups is that &quot;snare splitting takes too long&quot;. Well that's not a concern for me since I split with a bow so basically it comes down to &quot;use any class as long as it can get the mobs in fast and keep us beating repops&quot;.   <br />
<br />
Surviving the raw dps of a long or complicated pull, and staying FD through being cast on are the biggest concerns for me atm. <br />
<br />
Exactly. For me personally I don't have any AAs in the more &quot;pull friendly&quot; or channeling oriented AAs and it's become apparent that the only &quot;boost&quot; an SK could get to help them against the above situation would come from those but they are not much more than a bandaid.</div></div><hr />

 basically my guild has absolutely no clue what SK's are capable of doing.  <br />
<br />
There really is no single class or player that can pull Elemental and Time+ encounters all by themselves. Making SKs part of the pull team depends entirely on you. If you want to do more on a raid besides '/assist' then you have to make it happen yourself.<br />
<br />
I play with a few SKs that are simply brilliant at this aspect of the SK class and raid pulling in general. I learn a good deal from these friends and get to challenge and test that learning all the time. The pulling and add kiting are what we pride ourselves on. But it wouldn't be that way if our SKs hadn't worked to make a name for themselves.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've always pulled raids and done some degree of tanking, starting from dugeon crawls and epics.  But even up to today (Qvic/Inktua'ta) the amount of time spent pulling is far far more than the amount of tanking I do.  Our two primary SKs are part of the pull team (on a typical day 2 sks 2 monks).  The monks know it, accept it, and are great at working with us.  We have alot of SK specialty pulls.  So, pulling would by my primary raid function.  Trash tanking would be secondary.  Tertiary would be bitching about our lack of a decent disc or stonewall in our pull chat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kemora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">There really is no single class or player that can pull Elemental and Time+ encounters all by themselves<br />
<br />
Bullshit ;p<br />
<br />
I agree there's a lot of guilds out there who have absolutely no clue how good SKs are at pulling. I'm pretty certain we're the only high end guild on Emarr that heavily uses SKs as pullers. A couple rely on bards, but the vasty majority is all about monks. Every once and a while when I'm bored i'll let the monks dick around with a split or something for a few minutes and then go show them how a real puller pulls ;p We've had a fair amount of totally clueless pulling SKs apply, some have learned and made it and others haven't. I'd never take a SK that can't do more then OT, cause if I just wanted someone to OT shit we'd use warriors!<br />
<br />
NPC Casting isn't a super huge problem in PoP, but it is a pretty big problem in GoD. I've died more then I'd like to admit to while trying to split stuff in Ikkinz, though I've managed to pretty much eliminate the deaths. The real key is knowing what you have aggroed on you, running out of LoS, and waiting for all the spells to land and then FD. I can split most rooms pretty fast now, and I rarely die except when something decides to warp on me or the clerics decide i don't need heals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Krushum Gudended</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I pull probably more than I tank; the team consists of 3 monks, a bard, and me.  We work together, but there are some encounters I take the main job on, and others they do.  But yeah, I pull nightly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>scpio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">monks do all our pulling im pretty much a DPS / off tanker</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Skoggel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">My guild is stuck on monks and in some situations bards. Try as I might to convince people of the huge pulling utility SKs have I do very little pulling. It's not entirely nonexistant, but it just doesn't get seen outside of a few encounters.<br />
<br />
That said, the monks/bards DO do fine, so it's not like there's some pressing need. This (along with the fact that the guildleader is a monk!) is probably the biggest reason why SKs aren't asked to step up, and why the times I volunteer to pull stuff often goes unheard. Monks in general have all gotten their Snakefingers and such to get them more pulling utility.<br />
<br />
I think I'm grumpy only on principle, really, as for our current content they rarely have any problems pulling fast... that doesn't mean SKs can't pull just as well if not better though. :p It all depends on the encounter, ultimately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">There really is no single class or player that can pull Elemental and Time+ encounters all by themselves<br />
<br />
Like the above poster said, Bullshit.  I can and have pulled Time+ encounters entirely on my own (Hard Mir, Hard Tak, both Hard Ruj, all 4 Ikkinz, Yxtta, Uqua, Qvic, Inkuta).  As good as I am, I don't think I'm the only one capable of doing that, actually I know I'm not since other SK's solo pulled Uqua before me (hell, they did it before the trap change even).  I've watched Rogues do that to, and I'm sure I would have seen some Monks do it if our Monks pulled more often.<br />
<br />
If you snare split in raids you shouldn't be pulling them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Dendil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I've been pulling a lot recently for my guild. Part of the reason I started pulling (again) recently was because of lack of monks and lack of speed... I get pretty bored waiting 20+ mins for a pull, and I figured the only reason the pulls were taking so long was because the monks lack experience...<br />
<br />
Pulling isn't rocket science, it just takes a working knowledge of how EQ works and a bit of experience, I think I could train my dog to do the actual pulls that I have done so far (No GoD, all of PoP with the exception of time)<br />
<br />
SK's are great pullers, I could do almost as good a job with a necro though... I'd like to see a stonestance style /disc for SK's but that won't happen in my lifetime I bet. <br />
<br />
Generally I'd like to see someone look at the SK class and finally realise that we are absolultely the masters of bugger all, despite a perceived built in self-reliability.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't even particularly care which direction VI took SK's in, if they would just pick one and stick with it, atm I feel like no-one apart from SK's themselves realises the lack of definition our class suffers from.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Trysbrina67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">If your raid can handle 3 trash mobs in most cases almost anyone can pull, there is almost no point to splitting down trash to the point where only 1 mob is inc.<br />
I enjoy offtanking more than pulling to be honest, however I do pull on raids from time to time.  In all honesty who pulls tends to be based on;<br />
1. individual skill<br />
2. desire to step up<br />
3. desire to work with others (some pullers use the my way or the highway philosphy which makes pulling with them a bitch)<br />
4. last but not least  your class, although not as large as the other 3.<br />
Even though we aren't 100% broken on pulling I do think we need help with either a lull type effect or FD that doesnt break when hit by spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Darkenesis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Guild has primarily always used SKs.<br />
<br />
Of course, the old leader was an SK, and he did all the pulling.  The new leader is an SK, and did lots of miscellaneous pulling, and has been doing majority of the pulling.  So I've got to sit back, veg, look at porn, and tab back to EQ when there is a mob in camp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Ghismonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I used to not pull at all.  Then our guild only had two monks, and I got to pull some.  I did a really good job, and I enjoyed it.  I thought I made it clear what shadowknights as a class, and what myself as a strategist, were capable of.<br />
<br />
Then they recruited some more monks, and now I only &quot;get&quot; to pull phase 2 in time.  The main reason they state is Stonewall.  The biggest non-player hinderance I have/had is/was trying to channel through nasty pulls, when obviously monks don't need to.</div></div><hr />

I'm not a regular part of the pull team.  Notable exception is the rathe, I've assisted the pulls every time we've done it.  If my guild does elect to use an SK for pulling they generally pick me, we just don't often use SK's for much.  Have a ranger raid leader that pulls everything he can, monks do most the rest... and we have a pally fetish if we use a knight tank for anything.  I mostly just grab adds and bitch at hte warriors that come along after the mob is slowed and start mashing taunt...</div></div><hr />

What I'd like to see is a FD hotkey without any cast time.<br />
I'm tired of dying if for some reason (lag spike, graphic lag, weird pathing) the mobs get close enough to hit.<br />
Rogues have it, bards have it, monks have it, there's no reason we shouldnt have that kind of stuff too.<br />
We don't have lulls, we don't have the AA to avoid FD being broken by spells. We could at least get an AA with an instant cast FD.</div></div><hr />

We do have some nice tools to work with, IE in vxed, at the ikaav firecaller thing, our monk was havin issues clearing the room. I summoned out a pet and got em single no problem... I find myself doin this a lot in areas with lots of casters.<br />
<br />
I really liked some of brael's suggestions earlier like:<br />
<br />
1) insta-cast, long refresh, AA FD. Unbreakable only by the user standing up, somethin like a 20 minute refresh.<br />
2) an upgrade to DP, at the very least, movin it to a hotkey, hopefully adding some stonewall'ish type aa's/etc.<br />
<br />

As far as pulling during raids goes, the only mob that i get priority on pullin is firetail.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Alehop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Well the term &quot;pull&quot; in god is kinda relative in most of the zones (cept uqua maybe). I tend to call it fetching mobs. And most of clases can do that.<br />
<br />
Monks stopped pulling long time ago since bards and superior.<br />
Bards stopped pulling as well since they don't want to make monks quit.<br />
<br />
So whats left?<br />
<br />
In my guild its sks who mainly pull. I am usually main puller. In god I pulled everything from Sewers/Ferubi to Txevu. Even if there are other clases who have better tools than us, we just have the enough ones, at least for god. <br />
There aren't really any pulling challenges in god (cept uqua at early version, some parts of ikkinz trials maybe) so the &quot;pulling art&quot; its kinda dissapearing to become just a fetching of mobs.</div></div><hr />

However, keep in mind that is is in mostly group settings and in places like LDoN (regular level), Droga, Nurga, Veksar, a little LoY. I don't have much experience in the GoD zones. Even though I was pulling yard trash in one of the GoD zones once (forgot name but my coffee has not sunk in yet.<br />
<br />
Our guild has a serious shortage of monks or bards (and are very cleric heavy). Also, I group with a Paladin friend alot so we have him tank while I pull. Also, a rogue who joins us some in LDoN on occassion will help me target while pulling so kinda a tag team pulling system. (Helpful in North Ro where the mobs love to hide right behind the doors.  :) )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Kalendrox Grimblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Primary puller and offtank.  I pull Phase 2 with a bard helping, phase 3 along with bards and monks.  Pull coir waves/named, pull RC, etc.  As far as tanking, I tank phase 1, phase 3 somtimes (when things go bad), TT/Saryrn adds (maybe one day our wonderful GL will give the offtank group (4 knights) more than a druid and a bot cleric and we might actually survive!~).  I'll be tanking CT once I finish fearless, I keep VZ adds locked down with snares (totally gimps that encounter, VZ is a pussy now). etc etc.  I do more than enough to keep me occupied for the times that i'm not afk on raids.<br />
<br />
As far as pulling, I think were fine, but a snare without a dot component would kick some ass.  Ive never tried pet pulling, but heard it was ok for ldons and stuff.  Another nice improvement would be to get rid of the gd &quot;spell recovery time not yet met&quot; message.  I could understand getting that on spears, but death peace? bleh.</div></div><hr />

The response, most often, is, &quot;That was neat.  Thanks, we'll take it from here.&quot;   :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
On offtanking, we use paladins moreso than SK's, primarily because our pallies happen to be better geared then our SK's.  The gap closed a little bit with the buff stacking change, but it's still somewhat significant.</div></div><hr />

Our guild has excellent monks and several bards and rogues that handle most of the pulling. There's plenty of offtanking to do since our monks normally bring trash in bunches of 2-4. They only split when it's really needed. There was a period during PoP when we had a severe shortage of monks so I've pulled most elemental+ events. I pulled all of our Rathe attempts that I was at with monks as taggers.<br />

Main problem I see with SK pulling is getting FD off in tight quarters with fast mobs. Not getting FD broken by spells would be nice too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That along with not being able to get FD off a lot of times if things are hitting you and how fast alot of these MOBs run (which are both part of the first issue really) are the biggest problems.  I agree with Brael... caster MOBs can be your friend... but if we could stay FD through them casting on US it would help a TON (or at least have a chance of staying FD)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Maicom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">if your pullin casters the way i do, and the way i think brael is suggesting, you don't necessarily need to fd. You can for extra security if you think your pet might die, but I've found the casters almost always start castin a nuke on mr. giggles instead of rippin him to shreds with their melee. Pullin mage class mobs can be harder though, since they have pets that tend to melee your pet.</div></div><hr />

I often pull with my pet to get singles, but if the group is doing really well and can take it, I will just pull 2-3 at a time just by casting Blood of Hate on one. I've never yet done a hard LDON, but my gear is almost to the point where I want to switch to that all the time, but I am really worried I won't be able to pull it properly... so any advice would be appreciated.<br />

Brael, <br />
<br />
Could I ask you to elaborate a little? In regards to pulling casters, at this point I just give myself extra room, send in my Boney, /pet hold, then run 2 rooms or 2 corners away so they cannot cast from their original point.<br />
<br />
The caster then has to come running to cast on my boney pal, at that point I come part way back towards the caster and snare the mofo...and most times I get a nice single.<br />
<br />
Only time it doesn't work for me is on enchanters.<br />

Is this what you do or do you have a different method?<br />

Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Zobb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">SKs very rarely pull in our guild, we are almost exclusively off tanks. Monks do the pulling mostly, bards backup. I would love to have some pulling AA's and get back into that role more.</div></div><hr />

I stopped pulling after Veeshan's Peak because I was a guildleader and had more important things to worry about.  I didn't want to delay the raid pulls.  VP was definitely our zone to shine pulling.<br />
<br />
I know we can pull just about anything these days.  I'm just too lazy to do it.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Coolradjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">In our guild, Sk's are not &quot;given&quot; any role. We have to make it for ourselves. <br />
<br />
In Time, I of course add-tank in Tier1, and get to split Tier2, but that's about it. I could be pulling on Tier3 I suppose but I rarely feel like it as that's when we have a lot of monks online. <br />
<br />
In Ikkinz, I pull and help split trash with the monks, or with my other Sk's if no monks are around. <br />
<br />
I suppose I used to think we had no real use at all on raids. Then I said FUCK that, and decided to start helping out anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Valkyria Grymreaper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Our guild is all monk pulling. War/Pally MT and off tanks mostly. Occasionally I get to off tank. Thats about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Vermadas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Our pull team consists of monks and one very skilled bard.  I've never been called upon to pull except for a couple times in Time P2 Undead when we were short on monks.<br />

I don't have a problem with this.  They do their job really well, and I have no overwhelming desire to go out and join them.  I know I'd do well at it if given the chance.  I've been playing this game a long time (not always as a SK) and have a good grasp of all the mechanics.  But my lack of practice and familiarity with much of these new zones would hinder my speed and efficiency.<br />
<br />
That's not to say I don't have a role.  I off tank quite a bit, and grab aggro on adds that would otherwise rape the healers.  Some of our warriors are kind of slow when they aren't playing MA, so a couple paladins and I pick up their slack.</div></div><hr />

That is so much like my guild. Our warriors had quite a steep learning curve when we started workin on uqua. They were not used to picking out targets fast. All our offtanking has been done by SKs (well, SK for the most part) and paladins ever since we were in VT 1.5 years ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>kharan_zechts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Usually the sks and monks step up and pull. In time and god the sks are usally add kiters and pullers. SKs are agreesive pullers, sometimes you have to run thru a mob that could fuck you up to complete your pull. In god we are usually screwed if we dont have time to start channeling fd before the mobs get to us. Channeling and non interupted fd is the biggest thing that I have to work with. The things that I think will help the most is stun resistance and being able to resists spells cast on you while fd. Parry or riposte disk would be nice asset for difficult pulls. Maybe if it was short duration and quick reuse so we can channel fd when we have a ton of mobs right on us. I like pulling more then offtanking. My biggest issue was 1 group stuff requiring a warrior. Thats been nerfed now but I'm not sure they went the best way to do it.. Either way the tanking issue isnt as bad to me currently.. but we have yet to go into the later parts of god.<br />
I really like add kiting in potime (RZ/VZ/Inny)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Bards are really the more agressive pullers, SK's should be trying to stay away from the mob really you don't want to be getting hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Belyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">I rarely get to pull, monks and bards do the job.  I did get p2time firewater with a bard assist for the first couple months we where there, but that was becuase we where light on monks that could pull.  <br />
<br />
Necros can fd pull as well as a sk can for the most part, if ya fizzle, fail a fd, or just make a mistake its almost impossible to recover.  Aside from having superior pulling skills that have been upgraded many times while ours have remained the same, the reason monks ended up being the puller of choice was the immence monk population that existed in the game awhile back.  Pretty much every raid guild could have several monks that where very skilled at pulling if they wanted to.  Nowdays you dont see many new star quality monks emerge basically because there are just less of them.  I hzve a feeling thats why the devs gave monks more pulling abilities making it easier to be a decent monk, which they have done for several other classes as well.<br />
<br />
As far as pets and snare used to assist pulling, that only takes you so far.  Most of the sks i know that are good enough to pull have all been around as long as i have.  I have yet to see a sk that is new to me do a reasonable job of pulling anything difficult.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>kharan_zechts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">I think the main reason sks do alot of pulling in my guild is because the bards and monks never step up fast enough. If we need pulls and noone is doing it then i step up and pull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Necros can't pull like us, they don't get 400 range bows</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Grem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">my role is one i make myself, whether it's pulling or off-tanking, i like to pull, and i constantly pull when there are times there are other classes are better for the position.  DA gives us certain advantages, as does having a pet(they don't set off traps, like, in..uqua..oo big secret!), but mostly the best tool for pulling is your own imagination.  We as a class have potential to be outstanding pullers because of the tools we're given, other classes can be good as long as the person behind the keyboard is smart.  I'd rather have a smart warrior or wizard pulling than a dumb bard or monk.</div></div><hr />
