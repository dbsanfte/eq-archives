Run 3 and Regen 3 seem the major skills to raise in General but i don t know in what order regen 1st to hunt faster, run to pull or escape ??<br />
and after that (i know its quite a long way...) at 55 what should be my priorities ? mana regen (to gain mana while FDing) less interrupt so i can cast FD or other nice spells in battle without being too much interrupted, critic blow, more regen ??<br />
(i think i m far enough from 60 i can wait a little before discovering what to put then !)<br />
<br />
Well, tell me what U did did u regret it, what u wish u had done, etc.<br />
Thanks, <br />
May Innorruk's hate guide u...</div></div><hr />
