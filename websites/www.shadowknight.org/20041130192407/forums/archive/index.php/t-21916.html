<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kuvak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know it's been suggested before, but SoE has not appeared to pay it any attention, and the older threads that mentioned it were about other issues, so I wanted to bring it up again in a new thread.<br />
<br />
I vote SoE release another AA with OOW that would be an innate unholy aura, meaning it was up ALL the time. There isn't much fun in having touch of the wicked reduce our HT re-use timer below 1 hr if the re-use on UA is 1 hr, it just doesn't make much sense. Just make it innate, so getting enough AAs pumped into HT can allow us to fully utilize the Touch of the Wicked AA as it was meant to be. Who agrees with me?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If they're going to do it, do it innately - I'd rather not waste one of our potential AA's on something that would have such an utterly negligable impact.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Trysbrina67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Why not change the way Unholy Aura discs works?  Have it always crit with IHT and have a greater chance for dd and dot spells to crit as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Synapticus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Innate unholy aura makes too much sense for them to put it in.  <br />
Besides, although it helps reinforce the SK RP character, it doesnt do jack to help SK balance at this point</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Xanathol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Brainstorm inc...run for cover! Ok, chances of them 86ing a disc and replacing it with something else, IMO, is null. Maybe they can rework the disc, so that its not just a damage multiplier to HT, but to all damage ( but probably just spell damage )? Rework the run time and reuse time, enough so it strengthens our burst DPS, is still usable, but longterm DPS is still minor.<br />
<br />
Totally not thinking out the numbers, say 30 second run time, reusable every 5 minutes, affecting our DDs? Lifetaps, spears, undead nukes and HT could all be affected by this. I dunno; just an idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I agree that Unholy aura should be innate. Just have it add to the calculation of Harm Touch Damage once you hit 55.<br />
<br />
Now, since we eliminated that as a /disc, hmmm, think of the other things we could put in this place...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">no thanks, id rather have things that actually matter changed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Actually Croaak, It's easier to convince SOE to REMOVE /disc for lvl 55 ENTIRELY if they give us 50% boost to our HT and leave disc lvl 55 slot empty than to ask for another disc. We would be only hybrid without /disc at lvl 55 but that is good trade off for us, indeed. I don't mind having no disc at 55 with 50% boost to our HT innately. /disc unholy aura drives me crazy too long already. VERY VERY annoying!!!<br />
<br />
That way, we trade without adding new disc BUT we get to have our HT timer simpflied and work with AA better. We can finally super HT every 36 minutes and no more manually checking on HT buttons to see if all buttons light up before pressing HT or no more HT &quot;duds&quot; if SKs never bother to check for all HT timers to be up.. So, a simple transfer from disc to innate and leave disc at lvl 55 empty actually gives us an &quot;upgrade&quot; in code-wise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kyfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Let's run through this once more. We are in dire need of help. We have a number of serious issues. Let us stay away from asking for trivial minutia that don't really help us in any way.<br />
<br />
This suggestion is only worthwhile if it gets us a more useful disc in its place (following the logic that maybe we'd be more likely to get a changed disc than a new &quot;extra&quot; disc). Otherwise, it is merely a waste of everyone's time and a potential detriment to our cause (figuring there's only so much they will do).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>drael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">the disc should just always have been 36minutes because thats what would make sense so just change the refresh time or get rid of that useless 2nd and 3rd aa</div></div><hr />
