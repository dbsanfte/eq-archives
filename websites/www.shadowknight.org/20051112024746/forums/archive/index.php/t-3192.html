You are told to give it to somone as proof that you can be trusted... but it's not clear who...<br />
<br />
Anyone who has done this quest or and has the seal, plase try handing the seal to every giant or suspected giant ally that you find... if they don't need it for quest, they'll hand it back thanks to new patch.<br />
<br />
Let me know or post it if you find anything that continues the quest.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
Handed it to Korlek (orb guy behind tormy) - nothing<br />
<br />
These two are often dead and hard to get to on occasion (especially Tormax).<br />
<br />
Handed it to both priests Vallon/Tallon - nothing<br />
<br />
Wenglaks - nothing<br />
<br />
When I have more time I'll keep handing it around.  My guess right now would be that it's a non implemented quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bolas</div><div class="date">07-04-2002, 07:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was thinking more of trying the giants outside the city -- perhaps the ones in wakening lands or eastern wastes or great divide, not sure.  I'm currently threatening to kromrif, amiable to tormax, and ally to kromzek, so I'll need to work on my kromrif faction before I can go around handing the seal to anyone and everyone.  I'm guessing that the quest IS implemented but unsolved.... and if it's a progressive quest and the reward is better than collar of the storm... then it could be QUITE a sweet reward.<br />
<br />
Verant thinks that they have all the velious factions balanced and the velious quests balanced so that it's roughly equally desirable to be on dragon or dwarf of giant faction.  But almost nobody is chosing giant faction it seems... could it be that the reward for this unsolved quest is so awesome as to make the three factions balanced out?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kastizi</div><div class="date">07-10-2002, 02:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Have you thought about that maybe, just maybe it isnt a giant?  I mean, it does say, &quot;a noble's seal&quot;.  <br />
<br />
Who would be a noble person? And who would you have to prove to be trusted among the giants? <br />
<br />
It cant be VtS, cause once you kill him, you gain faction with Kael.<br />
I would try perhaps one of the bandit people outside that are on kael faction<br />
Or perhaps the spy in SS.  Or maybe the giants in WW for the scout quest.<br />
<br />
What about the giants that are guarding the injured giant in WL ?<br />
<br />
Just a couple random thoughts and ideas.<br />
<br />
Or it could be one of the nobles inside Kael?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taelnia</div><div class="date">07-11-2002, 09:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a thought.. have you tried casting Identify on the seal?  Perhaps it'll yield more info.<br />
<br />
...Then agan, perhaps not. VI doesn't seem to really fill out the ID of items very much, but other velious quests do use it(Ice forged shackles, the gut and stick identify something like &quot;this would make a good fishing pole/line&quot;)<br />
<br />
Just my two copper :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vargas</div><div class="date">07-11-2002, 02:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tried casting identify on the seal.  Just came back as Item Lore: Noble's Seal.<br />
<br />
I've had the seal banked for about a year waiting for word of a continuation to the quest.  I'm guessing it was never implemented.  But I hope I'm wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jarxle</div><div class="date">07-16-2002, 05:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dont think they finished the quest.  They basically skipped Kael on the quest end.  Look at the dain ring and prayer shawl, Kael factoin got screwed.  I think they ment to get back to it but never did.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Rabbi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bolas</div><div class="date">07-16-2002, 07:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it's implemented but unsolved.  They seem to be under the impression that the three factions -- giant, dwarf, dragon -- are balanced as they are now.  Gimme a break, there's almost no reason to go giant faction at all.  People like the +hp +resist armor that the dragons have better than the +ac armor for kael.  People like the ring and shawl quests for the dwarfs and the spirit of grazicor quest for the dragons better than the collar of the storm quest for the giants.   The only decent items from giant faction are the belt of dwarf slaying and the gauntlets of dragon slaying -- but those aren't really involved quests.<br />
<br />
I gotta think reinforcements for the tunarean regiment quest goes on farther from where it is now and that the 4th step and beyond is unsolved... what if there are 6 or more steps to this quest and they just aren't solved yet?  That would make for a compelling reason to go giant faction... and the intermediate rewards have been pretty good so far -- the cloak, the collar, that sort o' thing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bolas</div><div class="date">07-17-2002, 04:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When you do the &quot;Reinforcements for the Tunarean Regiment&quot; quest for Kael Drakkal, there are three parts to the quest.<br />
<br />
Part 4 is UNSOLVED. Nobody knows who to give the &quot;Noble's Seal&quot; to in order to continue on with this quest and get the REALLY good rewards.<br />
<br />
I suspect that it's like the 6th ring quest, where you have to figure out that you need to give your 5th ring to Korrigan's Ghost in order to trigger the quest to continue on and get the 6th ring. Korrigan wants proof that you are a friend of the Coldain.<br />
<br />
So who asks for proof that you are a friend of the Kromzek? This is what's hinted at when you receive the Noble's Seal. He says something to the effect of &quot;use this to show that you can be trusted&quot;.<br />
<br />
Now that NPC's will return items to people if they have no use for the item, it's time to start handing in the Noble's Seal to anyone and everyone that could possibly want it. Let's figure out where this quest goes from here.<br />
<br />
Also... if anyone has the exact text from the NPC when they receive their Noble's Seal, please post it here.<br />
<br />
Summary of the quest, taken from everquest.allakhazam.com, is shown below. Note that it hasn't been updated since November of last year. It's time to solve this bad boy.<br />

Reinforcements for The Tunarean Regiment<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Starts in: Kael Drakkal <br />
Who: Staff Sergeant Drioc <br />
Rating: Good (4.39) <br />
Estimated Time: Days <br />
Minimum Level: 50 <br />
Best Class: All <br />
Factions Raised:<br />
King Tormax<br />
<br />
Submitted by: Kumven <br />
You say, 'hail Staff Sergeant Drioc' <br />
<br />
Staff Sergeant Drioc glances over at you with a sneer and says, 'I have much to do and organize. If you have anything of importance to say you had best speak up now or leave before I lose my patience.' <br />
<br />
You say, 'I am looking for work' <br />
<br />
Staff Sergeant Drioc stops looking over his papers and takes a moment to size you up. You fight the urge to run in fear as the collosal humanoid considers you. After a moment he says, 'Very well. Our campaign to conquer the so called Tunarean Court has need of reinforcements. The Kromrif are already spread to thinly in the Eastern Wastes so mercenaries will have to do. Take these orders to the commanding officer in the field and follow his orders. Payment will be discussed after you complete your assignment. <br />
<br />
Give this to Lieutenant Krofer, who can be found outside the city gates in the Wakening Land. The reward for this first task is experience but no faction. The Lieutenant will then give you several other tasks to perform. <br />
<br />
No 1: He first asks for 2 panther meat, 1 raptor meat and 1 Tar Goo Strand. Return these to him for some coin and faction. <br />
<br />
No 2: His second quest requires you to catch a messenger roaming the Wakening lands and return proof to him. This is a Sifaye Messanger, it roams between the POG tower, the north wall, and Skyshine areas. Not to hard to kill. Kill it and loot note and return it to Lieutenant Krofer and recieve a Studded Velium Cloak. (Edited By AgMyles DaGiant) <br />
<br />
No 3: His third quest is initiated by saying &quot;I am prepared&quot;. Tell Lieutenant Krofer &quot;I am prepared&quot;. <br />
<br />
He will then give you a Letter for War to take to Staff Sergeant Drioc in Kael, who upon receiving the Letter for War will peruse, sign it, say to return it to Krofer and that the troops will be on the way shortly. <br />
<br />
Return the note to Krofer (who gives you another note to return to him after the battle) and 4 giants spawn at the Kael zone 2 Berserkers, 1 Acolyte and 1 Corporal. <br />
<br />
Follow them to the NE camp of Sifaye (1762, -285) and wait for the Corporal to say his squad is ready. <br />
<br />
Say &quot;Troop Attack&quot; and they will charge the Sifaye Village. The surprise is 4 Sylvan Guardians all blue to yellow to a 54 Shaman will pop up to help defend the Sifaye camp. <br />
<br />
This is a scripted sequence and you are meant to lose. Return to Krofer with the mission report and he will send you inside to see Drioc again. Drioc will then curse and rage and tell you that you must explain it to his finacier and gives you the failure report back. <br />
<br />
Although he does not divulge who his finacier is, I can tell you that it is an NPC named Noble Helssen who is located next to Wenglawks in the Noble's building. <br />
<br />
If you hand Helssen the failure notice he will inform you that it was not your fault and that Drioc was to blame. He then will divulge that he seeks to not only control the wakening land but the very force of Growth itself. <br />
<br />
He wants you to help him accomplish this goal. He will hand you a tablet inscribed with the runes of binding and tell you to seek out a turtle by the name of Corudoth in the Iceclad Ocean. He also will occasionally give you the Enchanted Velium Mask as a reward for getting this far (I am not sure if this is given out every time). <br />
<br />
Corudoth can be found under a chunk of ice at approximately -6000,+6000 in Iceclad. If you tell him that he &quot;owes Helssen&quot; he will deny owing Helssen anything. Handing him the tablet however will change his tune. <br />
<br />
Corudoth curses and goes into a fit of frustration before finally giving in. The ancient sea turtle finally says, 'Fine. I dont know what Helssen wants with that but I know where you can find it. Years and years back I traveled with what was called the Icy Mugs. We were a mercenary company out for fun and profit, and there was plenty of that. During our adventures we ran across a great many foes. <br />
<br />
You say, 'what great foes' <br />
<br />
Corudoth says 'Yes. One of note was the vile and evil sorcerer Rosh. A better example of depravtity and anti-morality I cannot think of. He researched magics destined to end all life on this cold chunk of rock and snow. We made it our mission to destroy him. In the end we defeated him, but alas our friend and comrade was slain. Poor Abrams was left cursed forever to wander that spire of ultimate loathing, the Tower of Frozen Shadow. <br />
<br />
You say, 'who is abrams' <br />
<br />
Corudoth says 'Abrams was a brave warrior and a good friend. His great maul could always be counted on to strike true as he used his body to shield others from greivous wounds. He sacrificed himself to save us from the eternal suffering he now endures up in that dark tower. The book you now seek, is in his possesion. You must first destroy his tormented form to free him from his madness. Tell him you seek the Arcanum and then give him the lock of hair I just gave you. You also will need the key? <br />
<br />
You say, 'what key' <br />
<br />
Corudoth says 'We ambushed Rosh on an expedition into the cursed Tower. When we faced him, Abrams ran forward and grabbed the Arcanum. He held it to his chest as lightning and flame rained down upon him. With Rosh busy trying to save his book it gave Petcas and I enough time to strike Rosh down. We went to Abrams and found our friend left a smoking pile of Coldain ruin. He underwent a strange transformation in which the Arcanum was lost. We decided Petcas should keep the key. <br />
<br />
You say, 'who is Petcas?' <br />
<br />
Corudoth says 'Petcas has retired from the life of an adventurer as I have. I would not tell you where he is as he is a good friend, but what I owe Helssen is stronger than comraderie or even friendship so I must comply; it is the word of Veeshan. Petcas now owns a small bar in the Coldain city of Thurgadin. To get the key you must fight your way into the city and kill Petcas. I wish you a most horrendous death Dark Elf. Now leave me to my sleep. <br />
<br />
Petcas can be found in a building just to the right of the Thurgadin zone when facing out from Icewell Keep. He drops an ancient rusted key. <br />
<br />
Abrams ghost can be found on the sixth floor of the Tower of Frozen Shadow. His ghost goes by the name of an incoherant spirit and has a very long spawn time. Killing the ghost will spawn Abrams. Hand him his beard and he will hand you the Arcanum of Rosh. <br />
<br />
Return the Arcanum and the Ancient Rusted Key to Helssen and he will give you a voucher. There are three rewards here and it is your choice which path to take. <br />
<br />
He will tell you that you can redeem the voucher with Kellek for &quot;an item worthy of a hearty and rugged combatant.&quot; This reward is the Collar of the Storm. <br />
<br />
He will tell you that you can redeem the voucher with Wenglawks for &quot;an item to be worn by only the most pious.&quot; This reward is the Girdle of Reflection. <br />
<br />
He will tell you that you can redeem the voucher with him for &quot;a sorcerous trinket of his own design&quot;. This reward is Helssen's Prismatic Trinket. <br />
Reward(s): <br />
Collar of the Storm<br />
Enchanted Velium Mask<br />
Girdle of Reflection<br />
Helssen's Prismatic Trinket<br />

<br />
Think about this:<br />
<br />
The quest cannot go on because no one knows who to hand the &quot;Noble's Seal&quot; to.  <br />
<br />
Have you ever thought about Vindicator?<br />
<br />
He is in Kael, and scowls to everyone.  But when you kill him, you take a faction hit.  In other words, he doesnt trust anyone.<br />
<br />
/shrug  Just a thought.  <br />
<br />
Has anyone tried handing in the seal to the spy in skyshrine?<br />
Or the giant that is in EW who is on kael faction, but SAYS he doesnt trust anyone despite their faction?<br />
<br />
Just a couple random thoughts.<br />

<br />
I need to repair my Kromrif faction a bit before I'll be able to test out all of those people... but hopefully some of the other shadowknights reading this will be able to test out one or two of the potential turn-ins.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Puurrdy</div><div class="date">07-20-2002, 08:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As this mob is perma KOS to absolutly everyone but a GM unless you find some funky way or charming him and his two friends or some such, he's not a quest mob.<br />
<br />
Only quest related thing he's for is his head for some quest in PoG.<br />
<br />
It's not possible that he's part of the noble's seal quest, or anything else besides his head due to his high level of angry at the world in general.<br />
<br />
Maybe he got spanked one too many times as a child.</div></div><hr />
