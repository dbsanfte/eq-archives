<br />
Long and short is, play what you think is the 'coolest.' With proper equipment and levels they all equal out in the end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chavo Guerrero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I would say that you need to play a dark elf, human or erudite.</div></div><hr />

WOOT !!! WAY TO GO !!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Makk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Troll, once you go with green, you'll know what I mean, LOL<br />
<br />
Ok so I am a bit biased, but I love the Troll's laying the smack down ability,... but you need to ask yourself what kind if sk do you want to be<br />
<br />
Caster:  Then go with gnome, eurdite, or dark elf<br />
Mix:  Go with Human, Iskar<br />
Tank:  Go with Troll, Ogre<br />
<br />
End game things do even out except a few area's,<br />
<br />
Hps:  Generally Ogre, Troll will have about a 500 hps advantage with the end game in mind, but that will become negligiable with proper buffs if all races are geared evenly.  No buffs then a definite hp advantage to the phaties<br />
<br />
Int:  One stat hard to raise, arguementively at end game eurdites, dark elfs and gnomes will shine, but with all the C3, FF items about, that isn't such a terrible thing, but one who does pick a phattie will have to deal with having a slightly smaller pool.<br />
<br />
Tankability:  If you are not a ogre don't look here, the advantage a ogre has is the ability to get a beat on something terrible and get off a FD without flinching, Makes them great for pulling and breaking hard to break spawns,  all other races don't compair in this area.<br />
<br />
Pvp:  <br />
1)  Iskars and trolls generally shine here due to regen,  If you think regen isn't a factor you are kidding yourself,  with proper gear you will always have a good advantage with regen but.... you need a total package and should really focus on regen items to really make you stand out.<br />
<br />
2)  Gnomes damm can they be annoying, I have on a pvp server fought many many twink gnome sk's, I am fortunate not to die by any of them yet (knock on wood), but out of all the sk's I fight (human, gnome, eurdite) they are the most pesky for me because they have a great chance of escape, nothing is smaller than a gnome female, and man they can find the weirdest holes to hide in,  One can easily fight fire with fire by carrying shrink pots on them if in a town area, out in the open not as bad, but because of pecks I carry shrink pots<br />
<br />
3)  Ogres and Trolls pre end game gear,  due to high hps, us phatties carry a bit of weight, therefore we can afford to not carry as much hp items and go for the bluediamond gear.  That is a huge advantage, if you don't think it is ask any gnome sk wearing full set of resist gear trying to overcome the hp handicap they would see facing a phattie, this is all pre end game gear btw.<br />
<br />
Looks/Enjoyment:  This should be your most critical decision when picking a sk race.  If you don't enjoy what you are playing because of looks then leave right away, post haste, or buy some illusion pots =).  If you like the pvp aspect of game consider the races I provided, and you will find probably more enjoyment out of them due to your particular style.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps you in  your decision, and remember this isn't a end all be all list.  Good luck out on the battle field</div></div><hr />

/em feels like a car sales man<br />
<br />
What is better than taking the ye ole tribe across America than in a &quot;Troll SK&quot;  Hey it may be green but damm does it get a lot of miles per gallon, and the green color on it just beams &quot;success&quot;. <br />
<br />
