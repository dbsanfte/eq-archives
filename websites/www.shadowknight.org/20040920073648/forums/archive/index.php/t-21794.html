<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Enobarbus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm proposing to start an ez-board called The Balancing Chamber ( http://p214.ezboard.com/bthebalancingchamber ). Please let me know what you think about the idea. Here is my rough concept for it: <br />
<br />
There are plenty of boards out there for each class separately. The Balancing Chamber is a class balance board. No ONE class is more important here than any other class. If you think so, then this is not the board for you. <br />
<br />
If you get your kicks flaming people that disagree with you in a civil manner, yet again, this is not the board for you. Incidentally, if you do flame and keep doing it, you'll likely just be precluded from coming back. <br />
<br />
I will be looking at the class community sites and will try to pick a few representatives from each board to approach for moderators. <br />
<br />
The goal is to get enough ideas that can be approved by enough of the class-wide player-base across the board that SOE will not need to worry about class balance. This would get done in what I call versions or stages. Each of these would have a clearly defined schedule of suggestion, rebuttal, suggestion, modification, final rebuttal, cutting out the losing suggestions and writing the final joint proposal. Then we would do the next round. <br />
<br />
The process will likely be long and sometimes painstaking, but I feel like if we came up with joint class proposals that had a decent amount of thought put into class balance, and if we could get someone like Brenlo to read the final reports, it might just yield something. Hope to see you all here. And thanks for checking it out. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kyfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">May as well be more realistic and call it &quot;The Flaming Chamber&quot;. Because that's all that is going to end up happening there. I give you 0% chance of any success due to your completely unrealistic expectations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Enobarbus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hence why the player base wont get anything accomplished. We take too much delight in tearing eachother down. And flaming eachother. And nay-saying. BLAH BLAH this wont happen, that wont happen. You think SOE is going to go out of their way? HA!<br />
And if neither SOE nor the players do anything.. well then you can just go back to hiding on your board and posting about the fact that SK's are broken. I'm trying to effect a solution and I don't need people to tell me it wont work. Cus that's the default answer. If you aren't part of the solution, you're part of the problem. Thank you, drive through.<br />
<br />
/yawn</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kahntun Derstand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If we can't get anything accomplished at this forum or at the SoE forum, we aren't going to gain anything from a third forum.<br />
<br />
It's a good idea in theory, but I don't see it working.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Enobarbus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">This forum is SK only. The Sony forums are split up in a similar fashion. These seperated class-isolating forums wont work. SOE wont just fix one class cus that will most likely piss off the other classes. They can't fix all the classes at once, cus they just don't know how. They don't even know what each class is supposed to do anymore. They had to ask us for our roles.... It made me laugh. Now they are asking for have class reps? SOE is completely out of ideas as to how to balance their classes, because you can't tug one end without pulling on the rest of the big picture.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'll post there, but I care about this much &gt;.&lt; about what other people think about me, so let them flame away.  I don't expect it to accomplish anything anyway - it'll mostly be trolls that post there unless you moderate highly, and if you do, then you'll have other issues, but I'm not going to write it off without an attempt I suppose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Enobarbus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm sure I'll have to fend off the cynics until I can get some participation and some people to actually interact without the usual us-or-them mentality. It could be a few weeks before it becomes viable. Just sitting on my hands is getting really old though. Thanks for showing interest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Good intentions but it won't work, goes against human nature.  Everyone thinks they work the hardest and deserve to be the best, espically when it comes to anonymous things such as this.  Read various class boards, a good 75% (or more) of people believe their class should be the most desireable and others should only be looked at when they aren't aviable for whatever reason.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Enobarbus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Right but one of the problems is the lack of understanding or communication amongst the classes. Heck, I didn't know what state SK's were in until I started thinking about it and reading about it. If you really put your class aside, it becomes very very difficult to pinpoint which class is the most broken. I guess some would find it easier to say which is the least broken. But still, in the end, I would think some more communication amongst the classes can't hurt.<br />
<br />
If we're going to be miserable, we might as well do it together <br />
<br />
=P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Chania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">What you should do is, anyone who is a certain class can't comment on that class. They can only give their opinion towards other classes, to stamp out penix envy. Course that won't work either, cause :<br />
<br />
1) Most people know shit about other classes<br />
2) Anyone can pretend they're a dr00d and bypass that safeguard.<br />
<br />
So you're still fucked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You'll have to educate many posters about the other classes before anything they post will be relevant.  <br />
<br />
What's your education mechanism, and what is the carrot that will motivate people to become educated on other classes?  Heck how are you going to educate people on thier own class?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Enobarbus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The carrot I will dangle will be the &quot;why the hell not carrot&quot; and the &quot;we beat peace in the middle east for more unlikely accord&quot; carrot..<br />
<br />
seriously though currently i'm trying to get people to post what each class does in the three basic scenarios: exp/regular group, raid (let's assume the final long boss fight with adds), and solo (if the class can solo). then I've also asked for each class to sort of label itself in regard to its primary and secondary skill set based on a finite set (8 i think?) of adjectives, so I can make a table that shows where everyone stands and where the overlap is and where the gaps are. <br />
<br />
Then I will also hopefully be able to gather some data on how the classes rank in each of their respective primary roles (tanking, melee dps, caster dps, healing, pulling and so on...)<br />
<br />
The carrot I'm dangling is that nobody else is even talking about carrots anymore. This is the grow your own carrot carrot. I know it's not appealing, but I feel like there are enough people that are frustrated with the general inaction and widespread griping, that something like this, if properly executed, might just work.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your input.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shadowsoal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">what enobarbus is attempting to do at the moment is collect a lot of info on what each class can and can not do and how they rank in these various catagories, then he is going to combine all the information into &quot;The Class Consensus&quot; from what I understand a document that will encompass current statis of all classes what they cnanand can not do, how they rank on things they can do, this will help to educate people who don't know shit about other classes learn the standpoint of other classes in a relativly short read.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Eatpeople</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">What you are proposing sounds wonderful, in theory.  You are trying to put together a comprehensive market study.  Survey as much as you can, compile, and present your findings.<br />
<br />
The problem, however, is a common trap of most survey takers.  A flawed sample. I will explain:<br />
<br />
10 of class X all agree that their class is 'broken&quot; for x reason.<br />
<br />
You could easily assume that 100% of class X believes theay are &quot;broken&quot;.  Unfortunately, 100% of your sample may only be 1% of the total population.  There are ACTUALLY 1000 of class X.  The problem being 990 are happy with their class.  Only the 10 angry members are posting.<br />
<br />
This will likely be the case.  The angry and frustrated will yell and scream.  The rest will keep quiet.  You will get an innacurate study, and possibly an innaccurate conclusion.<br />
<br />
You can see what can of worms you will open.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
so true and so funny. you'd be hard pressed to find a class board out there without numerous posts about how class x is 'badly broken' and must be changed. everyone would simply represent their own interests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Enobarbus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I know it sounds very lofty and it has many pitfalls, but with some help from people who are getting frustrated with the lack of change and the increasing mountains of gripes and moans, we might just get something done..  if even just to educate people about the current state of the game so that they can say can understand how deep the class balance issue stretches beyond their class.. The more classes that are included in this effort, the more can then turn around and tell their class reps or otherwise get the info to sony. Hopefully if all works out The Balancing Chamber will be releasing periodic reports which we will try to get to SOE.<br />
<br />
Here's to hopin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Howlitoezis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">If you want it to work, invite 3 prominent representatives from each class, and only they would be allowed to post there.<br />
Otherwise it will be a wallowing mire of flaming dog shit.<br />
<br />
3 reps from each class.<br />
no other posters. open to all to READ.<br />
no other way it will work.<br />
let the class members speak to their reps at their respective class boards, let the reps put forward the ideas on your board.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Recon that would be the only way it would work, kinda a elected parliment, congress or high council, hopefully representing a broad band of player types (i.e not uber raiders only).<br />
<br />
SoE are begginning to realise that many players know more about game play and balance than there internal reasources. Not surprising when many players around have well over a year of online experiance (as in more than 365 days played).<br />
<br />
This type of approach would seem to be a natural evolution, bringing with it benefits and, I'm guessing a few more problems on the way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Enobarbus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Actually the Balancing Chamber was a reference to a ring event in GoD i believe.</div></div><hr />

I think if you're going to persue this, then that is probably the way to go.<br />
Too many threads that have potential on message boards are contaminated with too much drive-by BS as it is.  At least this method would keep it under control and coherent.<br />

That is correct, it is a Tak Instance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, glad someone pays attention to these things.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The force is strong in this one..<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, the big problem with the Balancing Chamber involves the fact that there is no garauntee that any changes would be implemented.  It's just another site to whine, just with a narrower focus.  <br />
<br />
If this was a business, I'd never recommend investing in it until you give real answers to my carrot and mechanism questions.  As it is now, your site will just be a placebo, it may show initial hope, but in the end it cures nothing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">The approach is wrong anyway.  Trying to create a table of &quot;realtive value in different roles&quot; or whatever is simply not valid, because 25% of 1 role + 75% of another roll != 100% of one role.  There already exist such comparisons of each class's power in terms of each role or whatever (i think brael made one awhile ago... could be mistaken though, at any rate there's one on this board somewhere if you search for it) and they're fairly useless.  A board solely for class balance could be useful indeed, but it needs to be *highly* and *impartially* moderated or restricted to a small number of reps from each class and it can't be based on such an approach.</div></div><hr />
