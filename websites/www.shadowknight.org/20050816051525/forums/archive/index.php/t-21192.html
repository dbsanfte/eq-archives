<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vixeena</div><div class="date">04-23-2004, 07:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Having read a ton of threads, the general consensus for these levels seems to be :<br />
<br />
Gunthak<br />
Dulak's<br />
City of Mist<br />
The Hole Entrance<br />
<br />
also mentions of &quot;Vek&quot; here and there <br />
<br />
My main concerns are :<br />
<br />
1. Exp Exp Exp<br />
2. Able to do without a healer, and on SZ anyhow its not very common to have a big group for very long, usually ends up being me and 2 other. <br />
3. Dont care about loot  (wana PL to 65 fast as possible)<br />
<br />
<br />
Which would be my best bet?  Other places besides whats listed?</div></div><hr />

Hunted there for a bit tonight with a group, decent exp, but a bit rough on our mid-upper 40s group.  Havnt hunted in any of the other areas above as yet.  <br />
<br />
Been grinding in (boooring) DL as my standard &quot;easy, not very dangerous&quot; spot.   Everything is turning light blue to me though pretty fast.  Need to move on.</div></div><hr />

It gets pretty rough deeper in, I liked it the couple nights that I hunted there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ETHY</div><div class="date">04-25-2004, 03:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">CoM, is the place for pling on sullon. At least untill 52.<br />
<br />
No casters, no runners, and usually no pks there if you are trying to stay clear of them. goods and nuets only come for quest items usually. Experience was very good there untill 52 or so, then slowed down a bunch. <br />
<br />
If you can hook up with a necro who is a little higher, head to PoN and agro kite. pks will sweep the zone couple times a night, but they will be red to you and your corpse will pop at gy right after they get bored and leave so----.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you can stay in PoN for a bit that would be best. Try to get into a hedge group. Still decent xp for my 58 shm.<br />
<br />
But, veksar entrance is good, and usually no pks there. once the goblins get easy work your way into the first undead. Bring your group with, because you will not find one there.<br />
<br />
Also, nurga is good at that level. good exp and decent loot also.<br />
<br />
Really, anywhere the sticky thread says for that level. Just think about who controls the area and if you want to take the risk of having to cr in zones controlled by other teams.</div></div><hr />
