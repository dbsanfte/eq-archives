I really don't understand why people prefer 70 percent HT, landing no other spells to 40 percent and being able to land spells.  <br />
<br />
Sitting on your Horse chaining ToI, running up to HT wasn't my idea of being a good PK'er.<br />
<br />
This thread should help too<br />

A well played and equipped bard is damn near unkillable.  It's not really pvp.  Only thing that has been suggested is to do it indoors, like Thurg.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LocostrangeTF</div><div class="date">06-13-2004, 11:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">With instrument and AA bard can drain nearly 800 mana on you a tick.  Sure you can ToI him but by the time you are waiting for it to refresh and running around chasing the bard you're going to be oom faster than you can take him to under 75 to HT to kill.  <br />
<br />
Not saying you can't win just that if the bard isn't an idiot it makes it very hard to kill them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amphitryon</div><div class="date">06-14-2004, 10:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Make sure you choose where to fight him at, hell want lots of space so dont give it to him (manuever him into someplace that doesnt have a lot of open space). In my case I kmoved into a location where if he wanted to kill me he had to come to me. Dont go to him.<br />
<br />
Cast disease cloud on yourself. Then he cant mez you.<br />
<br />
Beef up your resists most of all, you can resist him quite  abit.<br />
<br />
I recent dueled a 65 bard (im 62). While I did lose, I managed to take him with me. I speared, and lifetapped him a lot, as well as resisted most of his songs.<br />
<br />
I did not have HT up. Once thing that gave him a start was when i invoked Leechcurse disc. (that and the MC mana tap procs)<br />
<br />
He eventually did manage to twist a mana seive on me but even then we were neck and neck. I fell over dead but he fell over dead moments later due to being dott'ed (Bards my have uber reists songs, but they cant play that all the time and still be an offensive force)</div></div><hr />
