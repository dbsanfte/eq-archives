<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shiverr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sentient is pretty cheap to buy in /bazaar also easy to get if you have friends or a higher alt.  I have some Sentient for sale on Ayonae Ro server.  Blood ember if you have deep pockets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">rather than telling this guy how to twink.  Believe it or not, some people don't have Lvl 50+ mains to twink with, nor 40 hours a week to play... And some of us actually like doing quests.  <br />

To answer the question that was originally asked, as far as I know, there is not yet any implemented Ogre Shadowknight Newbie armor.  The Ogres get the shaft on that one, along with Trolls.  You'll just have to make due with what you can pick up and what you are given by kind players who understand your plight.  If you want a quested armor, as far as I know the first one you can get is the Darkforge Armor, which starts on the Tae Ew island in Feerrott, but you won't be able to begin it until your very late 20's at the earliest.   You can do a search on &quot;Darkforge&quot; in the forums for walkthroughs and discussions on this quest.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps some.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shiverr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thus the reason I told him about the armor options.  Sentient is cheap (BP for about 500pp since PoP came out on my server) and great looking.  The Int addition from the Sentient is nice for us clumsy Ogres heh.  Crusty is even cheaper and peeps pretty much give it away while they camp Othmirs in CS.  I started out Shiverr in Crusty, and moved to Sentient after I could afford it.  Think I got all my sentient stuff for a total of 1000pp or so, maybe 1500.<br />
<br />
If you like quests look at it as a quest to get it =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shadwe Cniht</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">None of the large races have had &quot;newbie armor quest&quot; added yet;<br />
<br />
But you can do this quest;<br />

Greenblood Shadowknight Tunic<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Maelmordha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I went to Paludal caverns, the cats at the bandit camp drop large bronze chainmail.<br />
<br />
I went in at level 15 and it took me a few days to get a full suit, It is very heavy but the exp you get while collecting is is very good. I think I left there on the second day and was level 22.<br />
<br />
You can also get large ringmail to drop off the gnolls in Highpass, it is a good idea to spend some time there anyway if you want to work on your faction.<br />
<br />
I did the tunic quest and then got some rawhide armor in Neriak. You can also quest for a cleaver at a low level too running food back and forth between oggok and neriak. I did not stay in my swampy homeland for long, I think I left at level 5, but you will have to return there to buy your spells and train.<br />
<br />
Getting armor as a large character is very tough, I wish they would implement the newbie quests for those guys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Bronze Brigadine Armor (from the bandits in Paludal) is decent for the level like Mael said, and the xp in paludal is awesome, if you can find a camp... usually the place is brimming.  If you have some cash but not enough to buy a set of Senti or Crusty in Bazaar (the prices vary by server and piece, Senti helm was still going for around 800pp on my server, last time I checked) you might want to check the vendors in PoK and Shadowhaven/Bazaar too, as players who are trying to up their skill with smithing often sell off the armor they make to vendors (banded etc.), occasionally it's cheap enough to consider buying it... Or if you can find out what vendors give for a certain piece of gear and then find an aspiring blacksmith, if you offer a few plat above what the vendors do, it will probably still be cheaper than buying from the vendors after the player has sold it... if that makes sense.<br />
<br />
I inherited a full set of Fine Plate from a friend when I hit lvl 10, so my armor was very good for my level up to the point where I could quest for the Darkforge.  You may not have that resource available to you, but you might want to keep your eyes open while you're in Feerrott.  Now that I have my DF set completed, I still like to hunt the Tae Ew for solo xp and profit (they drop Fine Steel weapons and usually some plat) and if I ever kill a mob that has the Decayed armor pieces on it for the quest, I always check to see if there is a lower lvl SK that could use it.  A polite question to anyone of lvl 30+ camping in Feerrott as to whether they are trying for Darkforge and if so if they would mind letting you loot the pieces they don't need is always acceptable.  There are always some players of much higher level camping the stuff for their epic pieces too, so they will often be a good resource for you.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Another little trick that I have been using to augment my current Darkforge with some pieces of the Darkened Knight's set from Twilight Sea is to look for the Marks and Jewels in Bazaar.  While I would have extreme difficulty going to Scarlet Desert and the other places at my level to get the components for this quest turn in, others are of a level that they can go there for experience, and often put up their marks and jewels and such for sale in the bazaar.  Generally prices are set at between 50p and 100p per item, depending on the item.  I've been able to buy many of the components I need to fill out my set for less than 500pp.<br />
<br />
Of course, if you do that, you also have to wait and watch and check for those stupid marks or whatever that you don't yet have every time you are anywhere near bazaar.... /sigh<br />
