<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>TamikaFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What is the respawn time on Lhranc and Marl Kastane...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drakang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">3 days after server up and 5 days if killed I believe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Azzyenya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I turned in my Blood of Kyrenna to Marl Kastane and he despawned. Later that night I did the shroud turn in and got the Glohnor items. The turn in was around 6PM. I returned to him afterwards and he was hot up. I waited until the next day at 6pm and he was not up. Then, the next morning at around 8-9AM, He was up!<br />
From this we know that he has at most a spawn time of 39 hours, a day and a bit over a half a day. But i would guess that it is 36 hours to make it even. Theres yer info on Marl, I hope that helps other SKs too. I am curently waiting on Lhranc to spawn, BB went down at 10 AM on sunday, came back up around 4PM. Ill post when I see him next, so that we have a time for him too.<br />
