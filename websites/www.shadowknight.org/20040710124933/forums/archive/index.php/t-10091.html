<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sonsy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wanted to make sure my sig wasn't too big or something.  Wasn't sure where to have it checked so if you Mods don't want it here just delete it.  No biggee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ohisee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Could someone let me know how yu go about making such cool sig's<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Putrid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">testing my sig too</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vuurl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Why does everyone make a new post to do a signature check?<br />
Once you change your sig it changes it on all your previous posts.<br />
<br />
Change your sig then go look at your last post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Keyan Aubaine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Because they are fucking retarded.<br />
One of the reason why no one would even consider making me a mod is because i would ban anyone that posts garbage like this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kizzestra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">People make new posts when working on their sigs so they can test placement and hyperlink function. People sometimes change more than just the image in their sig, sometimes they change the location of it and the link and text too. You can't see if it all works right by just going back and looking at an old one.<br />
<br />
It might be nice to see a forum for sig testing where people can test their sigs and then have the ability to delete them themselves when they get them just right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jupke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">PREVIEW REPLY button....OMG it MAKES THE POST SHOW WITHOUT ACTUALLY POSTING !!!! WHAT A COOL INVENTION.</div></div><hr />

Yes they can see if all works just right by just going back and look at an old post.<br />
<br />
To create a new thread only for a sig test (or to make a sig test in another thread) is just useless and annoying spamming.<br />
<br />
And as said above :<br />

While I will agree that the Preview Post feature is wonderful, and everyone should learn to use it, a forum for sigs would not be spam. If you don't want to see them, you don't have to enter the forum. Too simple for most people to conceive, but there it is anyways. In my experience you can't move or edit sigs on old posts, at least it never worked for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Apokx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">lmao Novellus</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Keyan Aubaine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">You can't edit an old sig, but changing it in your user cp will change all the sigs of all posts you have ever made.<br />
<br />
Unlike ezboard who records every details like that, php just uses the info stored in your sig info for every post it displays.<br />
<br />
<br />
And if you want a forum for sigs, you should ask soulvoid about it ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
on second thought, it might be worth it.</div></div><hr />
