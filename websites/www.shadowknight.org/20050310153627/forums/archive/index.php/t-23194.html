<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ganodoar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey there fellow sks! Just wondering what your experiences are with this horrible camp for epic 2.0? Even though I don't have epic 1.5 yet or will ever obtain 2.0 for the foreseeable future at the moment, still doing it since I like questing.<br />
<br />
However, it seems like this camp is the new ashenbone drake camp back before they upped the drop rate on the hide. I have literally killed over 100 golems yet and got no bracer. Why do I have a feeling this is going to be the old decrepit hide of our epic where there were hundreds and hundreds of drakes killed but 0 hides?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Adus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I killed like 50 before it dropped, I had a shaman friend with me, but I probably could have done it solo, it would have only taken a little longer. Honestly I think it took me longer to get the master key to open the door to the golem area than it did to kill the golems and get the bracer.<br />
<br />
It wasn't that bad, maybe I was lucky, maybe it's not as bad as people make it out to be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Yaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Took me 3 hours, I was camped in the room by the zone out with 6 golems, then also pulled Drusella's room for another 4.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Imothep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think it's like the unicorn hair prepatched : very very random.<br />
<br />
I got one on my first golem killed, even before i got to Druslla's room. I was very lucky :  i got trained by  the  named devourer was roamer while i was at the first crossroad in ivu, and the only golem in train droped it.<br />
<br />
I love when the destin is playing  with you like this : i would never have killed it if i didn't agroed there  :p</div></div><hr />

Elder Holgresh Beads + Pet = Pet pulls  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Puurrdy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Never needed the key, simply floated across to the east side myself.<br />
<br />
Camped Drus room for about 5 hours, got I don't know how many pair of the druid boots.  Had some guildies come in after an epic ground spawn in the same wing, killed the single golem in the first room past the door and guess what he had.  Also had a second on drop heaed around the south of the 2 ways into Drus area (which of course I didn't go).<br />
<br />
Course the magician spent a good 30 minutes trying every trick in the book to lev from north to east where I could do it every time, it finally took him fire form and some luck to make it, no idea what the difference was.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shadoh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Lag is the difference.  If you have any, even if you cant see it, you dont make it.  Many times I've had folks let me bot them over to the ledge and then switch back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ganodoar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well after literally almost 200 golems the bracer FINALLY dropped from a golem in the zone-out room. To show just how long it took I made 1 FULL YELLOW into 66. Granted HS has a nice xp bonus but mind you 60 percent of the golems were dark blue and 40 percent light blue. <br />
<br />
All and all I am glad it's done. Oh and yes Drusella did pop during the camp and all she dropped was the mirror and some belt. Thank god I don't need the urn anymore  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Adus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Never needed the key, simply floated across to the east side myself.<br />
<br />
Yes.. but there's another door deeper in that can only be opened with that key, and I wanted to get through there, because there were more golems... I don't think the pet pulling thing would have worked for all of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>zice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Can pet pull as far as the zone out room from Drusella's Room. After patch today, got it off the 1st golem i killed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Furiousgeorge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">after killing 250ish golums I finaly got mine to drop from one of the ones in the zone out room as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Honorhawk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well i made 5 aa's there and abotu 4k pp killing Druz  thought to zone out before i got the bracer to drop for final combine.<br />
<br />
As it stands my guild is one MPG Trial away from anguish. So  hopefully we will start seeing some 2.0 info coming out!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Nanelane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I guess i had very good luck because i was there probably only 15 min before bracer dropped, in kith like 10 min, CoM dropped on the 2nd pop of the first reaver, and i even got the hair from PoG on my first kill. I guess its VERY random on drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Chania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I guess its VERY random on drops.<br />
<br />
<br />
How can something be VERY random? By definition, random is unpredictable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Leafweir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">On previous nights I've killed prolly about 100 golems... tonight I decided to keep count. Managed 86 before I had to go... (4 from drus room, 6 from room behind drus per cycle).... I hate this camp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>ziox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">200+ at zone out  . nothing yet <br />
<br />
ring from knights in kithicor . took 15 mins</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Leafweir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Finally after 300+ golems this damned thing drops. The graphic looks like an RMB, to save you the heart attack every time you see a golden bracer. This camp sucks alot of ass. I especially hate my friend thjat only had to kill 2 to get his. =P He kills 2 morits guarding east wing near ZI and has the bracer.... Me? No such luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>nekko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">9 hours later got it, Pet pulling works ok from druscellas room, difficult to get the last two golems in porter room thou.<br />
<br />
  there is a named that will summon you threw the door if you dont have a key, I recomend its less tedious to pull druscellas room and this cmap sucks enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>brokenlimit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">took me like 150 golems, solo was able to split/break and hold the 4 golems + 3 or 4 adds in dru's room + the 4 golems + 1 or 2 adds in the zo room before respawn.  saw like 15 pairs of ES boots rot, and killed drus as well.  so much for venril sathir faction that i somehow kept intact for 4 years heh.  as for splitting, you can just as easily snare split each golem 1 by 1 till their broken, not too hard a camp really just long.  also yeah, fuck the golden bracers, it looks like quarm bracer icon, first golden bracer drop got my hopes up &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Rueeliar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Three hours.  DS's room, the near two in ZO room, and the golems in the room around the bend from DS's.</div></div><hr />
