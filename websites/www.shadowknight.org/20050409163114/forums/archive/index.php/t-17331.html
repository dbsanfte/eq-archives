<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Winkles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is it normal for a mage to use the rooting earthpet in groups?  Doesn't the root make the mob attack the nearest pc instead of the one highest on the hate list?  Was off tanking today and was getting wacked quite often.  I was using my slowest delay weapon and was getting hit unless I was barely in range of mob which was cutting down on my dps because I had to find the proper range without getting hit.  I kept bringing up in g/say that maybe the pet that stuns would be nice for the casting mob but I figured the mage new his class better than I did.  Am I wrong or was the guy a moron?<br />

The level 52, 58 and 63 fire pets are 'wizards' and cast spells accordingly. Due to their crappy mana pools they go oom fast and resort to meleeing and casting as they regen mana. They usually cast as soon as they have mana for a spell, and their cheapest spell is... root.</div></div><hr />

thanks for this clarification.. i just know i've seen them rooting mobs =) now i'll be able to better explain why their pets are being dorks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dakkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">To answer the original question, sadly yes it's not unusual for mages to inflict root pets on their groups (and turn a deaf ear to requests to get rid of them).<br />
<br />
You were right but unless you go on strike till he gets rid of the root pet (kind of hard to do, especially in LDoN groups where time's critical), you just have to grin and bear it I'm afraid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Duke Xerro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">A mage who uses earth / fire pet in exp group is a moron. Air pet does more dps anyways (or do they do same dps??)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Angelov</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Air pet: Casts stun. Got good avoidance and mitigation, decent hp. <br />
<br />
Water pet: Casts a cold DD. 54+ water pets backstab. Mages LOVE tanks that know this and cares enough to let the pet backstab. If a mage is using this pet, try being consistent in where you position mobs and which direction you are facing so the mage can park his pet where it will have access to the mob's back. Mages are lazy and will appreciate it if you don't make them run more than necessary.<br />
<br />
Epic pet: Casts a 143 DD + stun, and procs 70ish DD - alot. In LDoN and other non-PoP zones this is the best dps pet. Due to the low level it attracts adds easily, and it can't really land anything on mobs in PoP. Nothing like the epic to mow down greenies tho...<br />
<br />
<br />
To answer Xerro's question:<br />
<br />
Except for the situations where the epic can be used, the water pet is the bestest dps pet. That is assuming it has a back to stab. The stuns from the air pet are usually worth more to a group, though. Also the air pet is a much better tank than the water pet.<br />

Note that mage, necro and beastlord pets can have their hp, regen rate and max hit increased by focus items.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>RaevaelDarkstar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Though Im still a lower lvl SK (L39) Im finding that EVERY mage Ive dealt with has used the earth pet.  Its become a pain to the point that I made a hotkey about root.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please use max melee distance!&quot;<br />
&quot;Rooted mobs work of proximity agro!&quot;<br />
&quot;Closest person gets hit, keep back for sake of clerics mana!&quot;<br />
<br />
After having to use that a few times I usually follow with a <br />
/tell damnedmage_1 &quot;Hey, can you switch to your air pet?  The stuns are more useful&quot;.<br />
<br />
That is usually followed by something along the lines of &quot;Just shut up and play your class.  Earth pet roots so mob dont run and it hits harder&quot;.<br />
<br />
makes me want to keep the pimp hand strong and slap the crap out of the mage.<br />
<br />
/tell damnedmage_1 &quot;Im using darkness to help hold agro.  Its a snare.  Mob wont go anywhere when its beat down&quot;<br />
<br />
damnedmage_1 tells you &quot;It hits harder so Im using it.  The end.&quot;<br />
<br />
Been a few times Ive told the group that it was either get rid of the idiot mage or get a new tank type after having to try to explain proximity agro to the group (who usually dont listen) and after trying and failing to convince the mage to use a different pet.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Duke Xerro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If I said air, I meant water ... get the two confused.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ulreik Fellreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I play a mage as well as an SK, and I can tell you without a doubt that the earth pet is not only useful for soloing.....marginally....its utility in a group with an SK is way sub-optimal.<br />
<br />
Post lvl 49, Earth is handy for soloing, but air is often better.<br />
<br />
Post lvl 49, Air is best for grouping, Water a close second.<br />
<br />
In a group situation where you just want the maximum DPS no matter what, and there is no danger at all, and no chance the healer mana will ever get strained, then water wins.  <br />
<br />
In a group situation where conserving healer mana might be an issue, or if an add may need to be pet tanked until a mezzer gets it under control (to keep it from sprinting to the healer on the first heal), the air pet wins.  Notice that this describes LDoN adventures almost to a &quot;t&quot;.<br />
<br />
Air and Earth do nearly identical DPS.  Water does more, but needs to be positioned by the tank to the rear of the mob--most SK's are experts at this from their own experience with Jibober.<br />
<br />
In general, the smart mages use air, and sometimes water in groups, and air, or earth to solo with (depending on situation).  If you (an SK) are grouped with a mage who insists on earth pet, boot him.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>bolerus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">hi<br />
<br />
i have recently started an sk (lvl 16 at time of posting)<br />
<br />
My main is a lvl 65 mage on Venril Sathir server<br />
<br />
I woudl like to defend a mage using the all powerfull earth pet.  but unfortunately I cant.  Earth pet is simply not a group pet at any level (although i understand the 65 earth doesent root - i am still missing that spell - )  except for a few rare exceptions.<br />
<br />
<br />
fire pet is  a good nuker with the new kindle spell (pet kei)  and dependant on the groups level can be a good alternative,  the 63 fire aoe snares and ice commets.<br />
<br />
but in most groups i use water pet, a lvl 62 water pet positioned correctly with summoned wepons can out damage a mage epic pet.<br />
<br />
If the group will be likely to fight a good share of casters, then Its air everytime.  If i got a plat piece for every time my air pet stopped a caster in mid chant, i would be able to buy enough fungi tunics to use them as pet gear :O))<br />
<br />
I hate to say this, but if a mage is inapropriatly using an Earth pet because it &quot;hits harder&quot;  try sugesting that he measures time it takes to killa mob with earth for say 5 mobs, and the 5 mobs using air, hell you can give hime a couple of gold to cover the cost of the malachites.<br />
<br />
using the above mentioned test, if he is honest he will see the difference and use his air<br />
<br />
If he refuses to try or refuses to listen to the results of the test, then you should think abotu replacing him.<br />
<br />
BUT<br />
<br />
If you have no movement slower (obviously this is an SK board and SK has darkness snares)   earth pet used in group is usefull to stop mob running but it is very inportant for the main tank to get a good agro built up before pet sends in the pet.<br />
<br />
<br />
on the whole though Mages are great group members, nice dps both sustained through the pet and burst through his spells.<br />
<br />
Dont discount mages because of a few, who havent learned their class yet, it is very easy to assume that the newest pet, or the biggest pet, is the best for every situation.<br />
<br />
Thats my first installment of <br />
<br />
my 2 cp worth <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Winkles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Don't get me wrong from my original post.  I enjoy grouping with mages who know what they are doing.  The damage they can inflict is just massive and I've seen the air pet interrupt many casting mobs in LDoN.  Plus they give ole bones a couple weapons if I don't have any rusty weapons on me.  <br />
<br />
On the subject of pets....Can someone tell me if our level 58 pet can use weapons and still proc his little life tap spell?   I give ole bones a gnoll hide lariet and velium weapon if I can find them cheap in bazaar.  Had the little guy interupt a couple casters with it and the group wanted to  know what kind of sk pet proced stun.  Guess they couldn't see the whip in hand LOL.  I used to use the ole gnoll hide lariet trick with my shaman pet.  I'd give him 2 and buff up his dex then send him against Crystalline shardwurms in GD.  After the initial slow aggro pet would keep aggro after a couple lariet procs even through an ebolt and vos.  Nice to just sit back and watch your pitiful pet eat a mob that has been slowed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Shayl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Ulreik -<br />
Nice summary.  I grouped with a mage pretty much full-time from level 1 to 65, and I completely agree.<br />
<br />
Winkles -<br />
Yes, your pet will proc his life tap if he has weapons.  I used to buy gnoll hide lariats, as well.  The stuns came in very handy.  I seem to remember that the proc stopped stunning mobs above level 55 or so - can anyone confirm that level?  Summoned Fists of Ixblit have no level limit and work nicely.<br />
<br />
Also on the topic of mages, don't feel shy about asking for summoned weapons or Jolum baubles.  The extra proc and hp from the weapon is very nice, as is the 15% mana pres on ALL damaging spells from the earring.</div></div><hr />
