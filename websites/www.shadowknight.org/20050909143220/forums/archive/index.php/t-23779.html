<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arangar</div><div class="date">12-14-2004, 06:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wife has a shammy in the low 20s on her account, and I would like to level her a bit.<br />
<br />
What would be your advise to get her up with access to the following:<br />
<br />
Ench 65 / Dru 53 (same account)<br />
SK 68 / various melees and casters ranging 10-50 in levels<br />
Cleric 66<br />
<br />
My personal idea was to using the druid and cleric to &quot;melee&quot; level the shammy into her 30s / 40s; but then, I'm not sure if the DS will be enough DPS for her to level fast - and of course from 45 or so, just let her leech xp of me.<br />
<br />
Any ideas appreicated,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wyrdlan</div><div class="date">12-14-2004, 08:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For level 20 to 35ish the DS will be sufficient, assuming she can do damage to all the mobs, on a place like the beach in Gunthak (Dead don't run).   Infectious Cloud will help for this, if she can get it off, but as targetted AE is probably only going to affect 4 targets at once.  Don't forget to use potions for added DS.  <br />
<br />
After she moves through that stage, another option is to use bob and flop with the SK on significantly higher level mobs.  Take the SK and the shaman (with the enchanter for tash) to someplace like Dawnshroud.  Tash, melee to almost dead with the SK, and malo and lay on dots with the shaman.  Then flop and stay down right before it dies.  With practice, she will be able to &quot;kill&quot; anything that she can land dots on.  Remember not to group the enchanter and SK (or enchanter will get credit for SK's damage).  Your goal is to find mobs that shaman can dot easily, with low enough HP for the sk to kill very quickly, but high enough to make the effort worth it.  You can use this method to camp for the shamans group cure in Dulak as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
shaman should be similar, <br />
<br />
Druid snares 4 mobs, use your poision AE as the mob beats on the the druid with full DS's up. should be enough to get the exp. (wizard used very low level AE's to do it), the druid doesn't have riposte where the SK would.<br />
<br />
if shaman does pull aggro, have druid heal self and it almost always got aggro back on druid (depending on distance).<br />
<br />
move from the beach to the fort thing in the tunnel. too many casters at the dock to use that area.<br />
<br />
hope that helps.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oagan</div><div class="date">12-17-2004, 12:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hot zones.  Check Sony boards for where these are currently at.  You'll be able to use the druid for DS/Healing until about mid 30's - 40's.  Once the shammy is groupable with the SK (upper 40's?), pair him up and let the SK kill green to SK, blue to yellow/red for shammy mobs.  Shammy should get all the xp.  <br />
<br />
Once the Shammy is groupable with the SK, you will have one of the best combos in the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly what I was going to say. Hell, I used exactly this (cleric reverse ds pl'ing shammy) in Sol A yesterday, works great. Took the shaman from barely into 26 to a yellow into 29 in about 2 hours, could probably have done it faster with faster pulls but it was a good pace.</div></div><hr />

<br />
do the DS thing till 45 get a JBB (jaundice bone bracer) and go to timorous deep and just kill spirocs till the exp starts sucking.<br />
<br />
also get shaman DS potions  (Kilvas Skin of flame) the arent too expensive and quite effective. Then just let him leech off you.<br />
<br />
also hit http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/ lot of good info there</div></div><hr />
