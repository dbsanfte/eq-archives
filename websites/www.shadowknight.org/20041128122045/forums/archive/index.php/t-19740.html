<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Blackstone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The effect on the SK Elemental BP is not really that valuable.<br />
<br />
Its coded as a 35% Disease Resistance Check Nuke Upgrade.<br />
<br />
That spell set includes ONLY:<br />
<br />
Spears (which aren't all that useful)<br />
ZBite   (which isn't really a nuke as much as a group mana regen spella and small group heal)<br />
Unholy Aura HT (without any AA modifications).<br />
<br />
That last bit really hurts, because many of us wasted 40+ AA's to upgrade HT only to find that the Elemental BP focus effect doesn't factor in with an upgraded HT.<br />
<br />
It also means that SK's need to shop around for yet another Focus effect to cover MR nukes -- i.e. the much more popular lifetaps and undead nukes.<br />
<br />
Considering that the Warrior Effect and the Paladin Effect are extremely useful to those classes, I think this deserves a look.<br />
<br />
So, might I humbly suggest that the focus effect on the Grimror Guard of the Plagues be changed from Fury of Bertoxulous to Fury of Solusek (30% nuke mod).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cyrielle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Actually i would love to see the effect changed to right CLick vOT but well can still Dream =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I disagree with Fury of Solusek on the BP, as much as that would own (espically since my spool is bagged 75% of the time).  The real problem is that the focus doesn't affect anything I use really.  Aura of Hate/Pain and Zev's bite are the only spells in my usual lineups which are affected by it.  I've done the math on this and it comes out to an additional 1.45 dps.  Worthless.  In an optimal situation it comes out to an additional 8.51 dps (4 spears, zev's, 2 auras).  I would much rather see a channeling mod in place of Fury of Bertox but that won't happen due to the stat distribution pattern on bp's so my next best suggestion is to change the focus to something that effects all feign death spells.  Say lower mana, harder to interrupt, and less likely to fail.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>BrikBludgaard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There is another solution.<br />
<br />
Give us disease nukes that actually affect what we fight.<br />
<br />
imagine tossing a new spear that takes some of our lifeforce (as well as mana) and that does more damage than it does right now...  also imagine your spears with a neg resist adjust due to that life cost for the spear.<br />

Dreaming away...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Still pointless, the hp component limits how much they can be used, if our current disease spells had a lower recast the focus would be far better (although resists still make it suck).  I refer back to my earlier suggestion, fd focus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Blackstone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Anything but what it has right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Darko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Our elem bp effect is not great but then again its not the worst either. <br />
<br />
I like Brael's sujjestion for the fd focus but i just dont see that happening, however a 25% MP focus wouldnt be too much to ask imo, it coudl even be restricted to determental spells only.</div></div><hr />

<br />
264HP limits how much you can use the spell??  hey wait.. we can LIFETAP for 470... 470 &gt; 264 woot!<br />
In 45 seconds, I REGEN 210hp standing...  if you are tanking it simply doesn't matter unless you are low on health.  Even the most dense newbie would likely stop using the spell when they are very low on health until they lifetapped or got healed to a reasonable buffer.  Yeah hp for extra damage is a downside... but all those extra regen and lifetap points that are usually wasted might be put to use!<br />
<br />
We both know FD focus isn't gonna happen...  We have a much greater chance at getting Solusek...  and thats a VERY long shot.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Belyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Im likeing the idea of a powerful spear that has a backlash hp drain component.  Give us a 1500 dd nuke with a resist adjust of 50, same mana ratio and cast time as current spears and a 10 second recast.  Have it do 500 damage to the caster no resist.  I would use that spell ALL THE TIME.<br />
<br />
It would scale nicely with equipment/progression in the game.  Every duffus that hits lvl 65 wont be able to use it even if its in their spell book.  It would have lower use in one group settings, but would be a powerful raid tool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Belyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Also, putting an instacast FD click effect on the BP in place of fury of bert would be nice. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Blackstone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">This isn't about spells, its about the silly focus effect on one high end item.<br />
<br />
I'm going to go back to my original thought -- Fury of Solusek is a rational and reasonable improvement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>aress</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Brael, explain to me why your spool is bagged 75% of all times?<br />
<br />
The spool is one of my dream items to get.  Am I wrong?</div></div><hr />
