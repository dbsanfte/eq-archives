<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ueuelr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After camping the Alchimst Acolyte for over 10 hours already, resulting on 2 spawns and no shard, and the hardship of getting people to come to Chardok, I have decided to take matter into my own hand.<br />
<br />
I tried 2 boxing with my (46) chanter there, but because of the risk is was to hard. So now I'm going to do it solo, trying to follow the footsteps of other Uber SKs (/wave Lejina)<br />
<br />
I actualy ran all the way in to the hut, FD and logged off in relatively safe area. The mobs there, including the Acolyte are lvl 56. Anyone has any idea what their hit points would be around? 8K?<br />
<br />
Has anyone else tried to solo that spawn? Any suggestions?<br />
<br />
If I get the shard solo, I will post my advice for others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kentsin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't know how well this guy would be soloable. When I killed him, I was just coming out of chardokb with my guild. I looked over at the hut and clicked on the mob to see what it was, and sure enough, An Alchemist Acolyte. I asked our rogue to go over and see if he had a dagger in his hand, and he did. So, we tried to pacify everything around, and pull him solo. No dice! The entire hut and everything nearby came with him. We had a full group of 65s so they weren't too hard to dispatch, but the acolyte was surprisingly strong. He hit near 200, and at 10% enraged. If you can solo that and manage to single pull him..well, go for it, hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ueuelr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I tried to clear the area behind the hut, where the little pond is (and the entrance to Chardok B too I think) but those mobs seem to have big aggro range and was unsuccessfull. Looks like I needto drag some friends down there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Okami</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">how does pet-pulling work on this spawn.<br />
<br />
And trying snare/FD didnt work either?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ueuelr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I tried snare pulling, pathing is a little strange. I have thought of a new strategy that I might try later. Pet seems like a big no no, it may be the reason for the large area aggro. I will try this again on weekend when I have more time if I don't get the shard tonight (some friends aggreed to come down and help, poor bastards)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>yuggoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Don't forget the necro epic piece drops there too.. so you might find a necro and join forces.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Crimson Tears</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Snare him, run to the chardok b ent, zone in when hes right near the ent.  Wait a minute or so, zone back into chardok and the other mobs should have reset, this is presuming you can clear around the ZI there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Okami</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I thought that was fixed a while ago.<br />
Was trying that in Maidens with some mobs. Snare, zone, and mob lost all snare effects. Tried it with my own darkness, and had a druid try it while I watched fd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ueuelr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I already MQ the herb for the guild's necros, and I don't know any necro that needs it. The damn herb is so easy to get, i already seen about 5 while camping my shard. Due to patches, it seems i'll have to try solo again on the weekend. I'm sure I'll work some thing out.<br />
<br />
BTW way, is the level next to the waterfall the entrance to Chardok B? That's where I tried to pull him, but the pathing takes him underwater, realy strange. I never through of zoning in Char B, I'll give that a try too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Darkadian Dy'Shaynn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hello, im new here i noticed your problem Ueuelr and i had a few suggestions so i thought i would join and help.<br />
<br />
Ok first off he can be single pulled i did it... now soloing im not sure i did it with a 62 Druid friend of mine.  But the little edge behind him with all the stalagtites and stalagmites is where your camp is move to the very back corner by the edge of the water.  Keep invis up at all times till your rdy.  Ok no watch to the left of the hut/ the back of the hut where all the herbalist and herbsniffers are make sure the pathing one is not by the dock before you pull him.  All that is needed is you drop invis and he will aggro you single pull.  Now make sure you snare him or he will run off and youll have add's like a mad man.<br />
<br />
I did it with a 62 Druid friend of mine and maybe you can get them to come cause he does drop a Evac staff with faster casting time than there spell.  But besides that i dont know how you would solo he is abit of a tough guy.  Hope this helps if not let me know i might be able to make it more clear in another post who knows.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ueuelr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I got lucky the other day and finaly nailed the sucker. I had some friends come and help, and the poped in the third cycle with the shard.<br />
<br />
Looking back on it I think it would be very hard to solo him with my current gear. Someone in elemental gear, with another 50 or so AAs would have a better chance. The place is too packed with mobs and one mistake with positioning will &quot;bring the whole house down&quot; ;).<br />

Thank you for you comments, it was appreciated.</div></div><hr />
