<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>krikk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The khukri quests were the whole reason I started an Iksar SK. They're all doable until the Betrayle quest, when you need to be 30 for the NPC to talk to you. Everything until then you can do at any lvl. Being an Iksar, you will never have faction problems, unless you get a faction hit against the crusaders somehow. But get the 2nd quest outta the way now, so you can save yourself some BS later. And have as much fun doing the quests as possible.</div></div><hr />
