Using half a mana bar to keep them snared and feared, eating there hp away slowly, when all of the sudden POOF, guard gone, you think WTF! Probably a bug, so you pull another goes fine. but in 1 hour of kiting 3 guards poofed on you.<br />
/petition<br />
Seems the guards are on a spawning cycle, refreshing of watch or some kinda freaky stuff. So every so and so min they despawn and repop. EVEN WHEN YOU ARE FIGHTING.<br />
<br />
FUCK YOU SOE !</div></div><hr />

When one would poof, they all poofed and then I would have a full respawn.  Granted, I dont recall that happening 3 times in 1 hour tho.</div></div><hr />

Why ? it's not cause i play the game i have to love the developers like some gay poodle, you can go ahead if you want.<br />
Some ppl should really try to make a difference between the game &lt;&gt; developers. I left kata now cause of the despawning, but it was nice an quiet there, without a bunch of dumbfuck trainers.<br />
You just go ahead loving SOE like some gay groupie.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">truc</div><div class="date">02-04-2003, 03:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i love soe just about as much as i love getting kicked in the nuts!<br />
<br />
they have terrible customer service and never listen to the players on anything. i never said i liked them, i was just making an example of you. so many people bitch about soe constantly but continue to pay them. i don't bitch about it because i have no right to, i still pay for an account or two and play.<br />
<br />
plus it's great to get you all riled up because it's funny hehe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
we do actually. look at the game on day 1. look at it now. 2 different entities. <br />
<br />
so keep bitching and bitching. petition. bug report. emails. phone calls. letter bombs.<br />
<br />
whatever you need to make your point and maybe, just maybe, whatever you think needs to be changed will.</div></div><hr />

So your are correct with the verbage and usage.  However you living in or as you stated something about a Belgium board, I tried to take the Nederlaanders angle.<br />
<br />
Pascal Bal, nothing short of wunderkinnder, the I film De Kapster should be seen by all, just to give you an idea.  That is if you're into Flams Vrauen.  <br />
<br />
You seem like a cool klothummel Maneer, so I reached out.  Back in '83 I was in Joh-burg getting into trouble and while I can't say my Afikaans is tight, it's passable.<br />

<br />
Of course, since (to the best of my knowledge), Jupke is the only one who understands that, you could be considerate and take it to tells. (EDIT: Er, I mean PMs)</div></div><hr />

<br />
This was Jupke's thread on the FLAME board right?  Take your self-righteous @ss and go f' off.  Flames are just that, wide open, and out there, you dig?  <br />
<br />
I'll tell you that what I said, while not grammatically correct for Dutch or Flemish, Jupke will get the point about his despawning frustration.  &quot;Sometimes you ride the bull, and sometimes the bull rides you. &quot;<br />
<br />
You and Bick wanna sniff my crank on other forums here and take your pot shots, that's cool with me.  But don't you come with that whole attitude here about what I can and can't do in the flame section.  Take your PM's and stick them in your @ss, along with Mr. Prick, oh, did I say prick?  I meant Bick.  <br />
<br />

<br />
1.) Die in hell<br />
<br />
2.) Shut the fuck up.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rizek</div><div class="date">02-07-2003, 01:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i think a third option would be better<br />
<br />
3) Become Sam Deathwalkers friend (http://www.fohguild.org/forums/showthread.php?threadid=5328) <br />
<br />
Which is ultimately worse than either of those two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bick is Good</div><div class="date">02-07-2003, 01:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">wow, that guy RULES!<br />
<br />
-Bick</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jupke</div><div class="date">02-07-2003, 03:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hehe, yeah, sam is funny, the mods keep changing his titles and posts, everybody hates him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jobrill</div><div class="date">02-07-2003, 03:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dude. Steps is Sam Deathwalker.<br />
<br />
IT ALL MAKES SENSE NOW.<br />
<br />
Man, I knew Sam Deathwalker before he went Hollywood, when he was just a two-bit troll on the Sullon Zek Boards. Gotta Respect da Deathwalker, y0.<br />
<br />
BTW, Steps, like the new attitude in that last post. Much nicer than the Sugar coated nice old necromancer man bearing candy and lollipops and l33t quest infoz thing you got going before. I mean, comparing me to Bick, that was a low blow. Exactly my style. Hell, if I still had a heart, It'd be broken by now. Keep it up.</div></div><hr />

Anywayz Despawns are the suck. Especially when they are high end mobs :(</div></div><hr />
