<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>utope eljugador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've noticed a lot of ideas for improving knight tanking capacity in general.  First question: When using a shield in combat, weren't they designed to block attacks from enemies? <br />
<br />
Suggestion: When any class has a shield equiped they get a &quot;mitigation&quot; bonus (much like warrior innate mitigation) based upon the AC of the shield. Meaning, the shield does add a certain amount of &quot;armor class&quot; or armor rating and the mitigation % could be based upon that. <br />
<br />
So something like a 20ac shield isnt going to mitigate as much damage as a 70 ac shield. It should be a significant % as well, being as shields block / deflect quite a bit of incoming damage.  Something like 25-50% of the AC value.<br />
<br />
This would do a few things:<br />
<br />
a) Increase the tanking ability of all &quot;tank&quot; classes across the board, from beginner to end game. Shields are available at all levels of the game. <br />
<br />
b) Give options. Does a warrior want to duel weild for more agro, better damage or use a shield and a sword to increase is tanking ability? It would open up a bit of variation to classes on how people want to play in different situations.<br />
<br />
c) Everyone is happy. Warriors can use a shield without feeling as gimped. They would still tank significantly better with stonewall / defenisve and their innate mitigation. Knights would gain the ability to tank for group trials in GoD, and other places without being a &quot;detriment&quot; to the group.<br />
<br />
But that would be too easy and be to logical. Though, whats logical about an ogre wearing plate armor summoning skeletons and feasting on blood?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Synapticus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Should be avoidance and mitigation AA's geared for shields.  <br />
SOmething thats like combat agility and stabilty, (2/5/10%), and an additional bonus of percentage to each like physical enhancement does.</div></div><hr />
