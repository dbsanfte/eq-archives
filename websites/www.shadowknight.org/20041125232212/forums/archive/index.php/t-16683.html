<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>nezzka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Clerics get root, paladins get root. Necros get root, sks dont get root. I would really like root because when im playing around in the arena people will always run out nuke and run back in, sure a snair will make em slow down but they can run rite back in the gate. I would like if sks got some kind of root/dot, like skeleton hands come out of the ground and hold the person for 24 seconds doing like 50 damage a tick. I play on a blue server so some pvp people will probly call me a nub, but i would like to get some kind of root.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thats the same way we finally got Harmshield really... but I can't see root coming.<br />
<br />
The argument will always be that &quot;paladins get root, we get snare&quot; therefore its balanced.<br />
<br />
That said, I'd still support any major campaign to get root!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i want pally root ;) -30 resist check heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Blackstone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Its kind of ironic that SK's start out as good soloers but loose solo ability at higher levels.<br />
<br />
Paladins start off as weaker soloers but finish much stronger, esp. with the AA skills that mod heals and stuns.<br />
<br />
One reason that we loose MOST of our solo power is that fear stops working on lvl 55+ mobs -- even if they are MR vulnerable.<br />
<br />
I can understand them not wanting us to be able to fear things.  Especially with a mana pool the size of mine, I can fear kite practically non stop.  But, the pendulum has definitely swung too far.  Compensation is needed.<br />
<br />
Root is the most basic form of crowd control, every class that can snare can root, except for SK.  We don't need fancy roots with DD's or weird resist checks.  We need just plain old root.<br />
<br />
Necro's get root pretty late, we should as well.  We should also get root only after fear has zero usefulness.  That means Lvl 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Duke Xerro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Sk can still solo at high levels. Much better than paladins, theres only 1-2 places pally can solo at higher levels to get good exp, while sk can aggro kite in many places.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kenshi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">necros get their first root at lvl 16.<br />
something i don't really uderstand to well is about pallies getting haste. might just be me thou, yeah it is said they suck at dps, but kinda a hard pill to swallow with them having haste and ralitively good cheap weapons.. like mace of the fallen crusader, goes for around 100-300pp on seventh last tiem i checked</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sabshail1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I don't think SK's really need root..<br />
<br />
What I would much prefer to see is a slow spell.  Paladins receive a self haste, in turn as the Anti-Knight, it would only make sense that we receive a slow type spell.<br />
<br />
Having said that, it should never be as powerful as a shamans/enchanters/beast.  I'd settle for a 25% - 30% slow, would make my soloing days alot more fun also.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Makkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">no, necros get their first undead root at 16. the first real root is 34 i believe.<br />
<br />
and i dont know why pallies get such a badass root at 65. real fast casting, mana cost, and low resist check its one of the best roots in game. not to mention their 61 root nec dont even get till 62 and they're a fucking hybrid<br />
<br />
i agree that sk and paladin spells are not in balance. and like brael posted, su3 in ldon is a pretty big advantage. though necros don't really do tons of dmg to undead anyway, their best nuke is 1200 and clerics get it at 64. they are more about controlling undead. except well..no undead lull past the first one, no undead tash for charm..<br />
<br />
fuck it i'm creating a clerdruipalbardwar hybrid and im gonna pwn joo all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kizzestra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">We don't get root and we never will. You think the &quot;nerf SKs&quot; fire is burning brightly now? Give us a root and just see what happens! It wouldn't be pretty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ilvai Oloth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If we got root, it would only add to the amount of people who believe we need to get nerfed...<br />
<br />
...besides, I think we could come up with something much better for ourselves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>AislinSteele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Again, something I don't understand. WTF do we need root for? If our main jobs are to tank, pull, or DPS, where does CC come in? Leave that to the casters and those in the back-end. Pallys having root makes me scratch my head, but I hate Pallys, so I don't put much energy into that<br />
<br />
Want root? Get aggro. You stand still, mob beats on you, mob doesn't run off, so theres your root. CD stops em from wandering most of the time so thats dealt with too.<br />
<br />
Edit: as far as PvP goes, I don't do it at all. Never really understood it, but thats me. But I find the following lineup helpful (mind you, I'm on a PvM server)<br />
<br />
Lifetap<br />
Darkness (fast casting one)<br />
Darkness (higher-level one)<br />
Shadow-step line<br />
Invisibility<br />
DoT<br />
DoT<br />
Debuff (usually AC debuff or Cancel Magic)<br />
** Cast Deadeye prior to any duel, if you can forsee it. PvP servers are a bit more difficult, yes **<br />
<br />
Dueling, I find that theres 3 methods; Raw tanking, runby hits with DoT's added, or pure DoT-and-wait methedology. Roots don't stick solidly enough for most classes to be reliable (doesn't for my Wizzie anyway, not till lvl 62ish) and the purpose of a duel is to test skill. Not to be cheap</div></div><hr />

<br />
We have not been playing the same game then.<br />
<br />
The complete and utter bullshit that is being flung around about root increasing our utility makes baby jezus cry.<br />
<br />
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO USE IT FOR?!<br />
<br />
Your job is to tank, and keep the target on you. the rest of the party needs to do THEIR jobs. THEY need to do CC, not *you* . You are already fulfilling a role. Asking root is asking for another 200 page whine fest on various class boards.</div></div><hr />

We used to have a nice line of debuffs that where completely obliterated and replaced with nothing.  When you say party im not sure if you mean group or raid.  Im not gonna hold my breath for ever seeing root, but i would like some more utility for raid encounters.  Debuffs is just one thing in a long list of features that we have lost over the years.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Drakonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Pulling-wise, it would make a very useful extra feature, especially combined with snare.  However while Fading Memories remains as powerful as it is, it wouldn't have much impact anyway.<br />
<br />
Solo-wise, it would allow us to Root/DoT solo mobs, instead of having to kite them around... this would probably be less efficient since we couldn't use pets, but would require much less effort when you feel more like relaxing than running a mob around.<br />
<br />
Equally, survival-wise, for example if you fail a FD infront of a rootable mob, you could root it and move away to get the FD off.<br />
<br />
There's quite a few good uses for it, and I for one would love to see it... but just the same I doubt we'll ever see it added to our lineup.</div></div><hr />

A nice line of debuffs...heh, right. Just a question, i dont know what teir you are raiding on, but since when did *anyone* use root in raids bar very specific encounters?<br />
<br />
<br />
We *dont* need root, it adds nothing to us while creating a whole bigger flamefest.</div></div><hr />

No offense here, but all I read in this is 'I don't want to do any actual work, so give me root so I can cast it and then sit down and stare at my monitor to watch for DOTs to wear and when to re-root' ...<br />
<br />
There are a few items in the game that give us a click root, but actually needing it?  Naaaa.. Would it make alot of things easier?  Heck yeah, so would gate, or port spells, etc ...<br />
<br />
I solo just fine without root, yeah I have to dance around and let the MOB chase me, but it gives my pet something to do (he gets bored waiting for me to summon him, also, I think he is getting fat, so the exercise can do him some good ...) ..<br />
<br />
Personally, I'd rather have Bind Affinity and Gate more than root  =)</div></div><hr />

I probably explained it in a bad way... Soloing dosen't really mean much to me anymore with LDoN release anyhow, I don't grind exp or solo anymore.  But a while ago I remember wishing I could root while soloing instead of kiting around - if it was reliable enough we could solo 2-3 mobs maybe at the same time if your mana pool was enough.<br />
<br />
True enough though, Bind / Gate would be good to have.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now this is true, doing 2-3 mobs at the same time would be/have been nice ... And yeah, with LDoN, doing hard missions you get pretty good XP while earning other things, this is why I don't grind much either  ;)</div></div><hr />

You would be surprised how effective casting shroud of pain, shadow vortex, and the other str sta agi atk debuffs that i cant remember the name of on SoV mobs.  At that time dots where forbidden, as there was no room with all the debuffs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Debuffs which, even if they got room to stack, in the grand scheme of things didnt do fuck all to the mob anyway(except perhaps good the good agro grrr) , that is why they got replaced with damage versions. aka aura of pain, hate....<br />
<br />
just say NO to root. we  do not need it, we have snare, and besides we are tanks , not crowd control.<br />
<br />
we have more &quot;useful&quot; utility now than we ever had ..</div></div><hr />
