<br />
Haven't lost one yet, granted that out of the 10, 5 were warriors hehe...<br />
<br />
3 of the 5 I didnt even have to SS, I just out-tanked them in straight out melee.<br />
<br />
2 of the 5 were well equiped and I was forced to SS, spirit tap, spear of plague, spear of pain them to death.<br />
<br />
Dueled 2 rogues... I know I know...easy duels hehe..<br />
<br />
2 monks... first easy 2nd hard (was guild leader and had uber equipment and he said no spell usage HT or pet for me and no mend for him. I could self buff so I busted out my DS hehe that was probably what gave me my win)<br />
<br />
and last but not least... one ranger.... EZ<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyone else have impressive dueling records?</div></div><hr />

anyways my duel record is like 40-4 W-L, 2 losses to two 60+ casters, 1 loss to a rogue in full assassins(cept BP which was mrylo) had epic/ribsmasher(i think thats the name 19/25) with 10AAs, conned even to me...he deleveled, and last one was against a some mage...pet rooted me and he kicked my ass... think he was a couple levels higher than me. The wins varied from 20 minute duels vs. pallys, shammys, bards to 10 second duels against a wizzie who fell to a couple spears and HT...oh yeah i also beat a 60 necro...:D (well not really he decided to use his OT hammer after i got him to half health...he forgot to summon a pet and couldnt target me with invis/hide/SS...i had full hp/no resist gear, its kinda sad...friends dont let friends use ebay</div></div><hr />

Drained all my str, and then blinded me, mezzed me and finally mana tapped me.. before killing me with a flux so i took an xp hit =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lunaticfringesk</div><div class="date">01-14-2003, 03:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Interesting some of the messages on this thread...<br />
<br />
WAR, ROG, and MNK are all fairly easy to beat, as their strategy is almost always straightforward.<br />
<br />
One interesting thing I saw was a PLD--fairly easy?  interesting...<br />
<br />
A SHM can be a major pain, and a chanter probably moreso.  As a matter of fact, chanter is one of the classes I do not mindlessly charge into battle against.  They are definitley a worthy foe.<br />
<br />
I have never dueled a bard, but I am not excited to get into it with them if they can run all over the damn place.  As a matter of fact, has anyone beaten a bard when they had room to run around (and knew what they were doing, etc.).  It seems like they would annoy me to no end with a run tactic that would prove fruitless for an SK to even get involved, but I have never dueled one...<br />

rogues, monks, warriors are too easy on average, even if they are 2 to 3 levels higher.  that being said ive met and dueled some expectional pure melees.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have 637 pk's on Bippitty, and that's not counting Corpse camp kills, or kills where I was pking with a friend or guildies. <br />
<br />
Go join a real server before you brag about winning 10 duels, lol.<br />

<br />
Anyway I won 2/2 duels (&lt;-- uber l337), at 49, beat a 51 rng and 46 rng. Almost utterly destroyed a 55 monk when a 62 paladin with windblade wiped the floor with the monk. I was so close too..<br />
<br />
I kind of miss sullon zek sometimes..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rezzbagg</div><div class="date">01-15-2003, 06:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't understand why anyone would agree to not using spells, ht , pet whatever in a duel. I mean if you dont want me to do that then you obviosly don't want to duel an sk.It wouldbe like asking a warrior to not duel wield, or a monk to just use normal attack. If you want to duel an sk without spells, pet, and Ht then why don't you go challenge a warrior 10 levels lower than you?<br />
<br />
A side note I have only lost one duel, I haven't been in that many, but I am pretty happy with it. I wouldn't even duel until I was 20 something, I just didn't trust that Iwould keep all my xp gear whatever, lol. The one I lost was to a stinkin warrior friend of mine, I found out the hard way that fd doesn't work in PvP, heh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
One was a chanter 4 levels higher than I was <br />
I was 46 they were 50.<br />
<br />
Acutally I was supposed to be just dueling his pet. I allowed him to use debuffs.<br />
I was owning his pet Dark/Fear when out of the blue I get Gravity fluxed twice, then he feared me just as my fear ran out on his pet. Pet wiped me at that point.  So yeah I lost but he broke the initial aggrement on the duel.<br />
<br />
One was against a monk of the same level. Again I got rooked. He was fully buffed with AC/HP and haste. I had no buffs. (although we never made any agreement to be fully debuffed to start)<br />
<br />
Another was  a warr that was 7 levels higher and had much better equipnment than I had. His resistances made my spells useless. I did however get revenge later by coming back better prepared two levels later and in this case <br />
tactics &gt; Uber armor and levels<br />

Have dueled all other classes except Bard and Shammy.<br />

<br />
Ive dueled 5 with CB, its a nice ability but other than that not too impressive in PvP, especially when you can pet and dot kite and there isnt much the rogue can do about it.  1 on 1 rogue isnt anything special they have to be in melee to do high amounts of damage (deadly strike for 55 is lol!) and cant heal.  with a partner a rogue is pretty damn devastating.</div></div><hr />

I PK indoors alot, and use the element of surprise... BTW, for you bluebies, when you duel a chanter, cast disease cloud on yourself... works wonders for mez, heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tumy</div><div class="date">01-16-2003, 03:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all, im a 52nd LvL Ogre Sk and I love to duel.  <br />
I have a full set of BD, earring of essance, Froggy crown, SSB, Ceremonial Smudging stick, Reaver, Moktor Boots, Mushroom Veil,Iron amulet of Unseen horors, and more I cant think of right now.  Have 3 back packs of resist gear changes when im dueling.<br />
<br />
Depending on the opposing class I switch the resist gear in and out.  My guild and I play in the Arena in Lake Rathetear every friday night.  it is much fun!  We have many peeps in the 50's and some in the 60's.  <br />
<br />
Im the only SK in guild, and let me tell ya we shine on the PvP battle field.  <br />
<br />
My best friend is a 53rd shaman, and he is a tough opponent.  I have won 6 out of 7 duels with him though.  He is getting better =)<br />
<br />
We do alot of EnMass battles, and I seem to do very well with my evade skills.  If I get a high level kicken my but, I'll SS and hide.  Harm Sheild has saved my but so many times I cant count when ive been rooted.<br />
<br />
I have to agree with the posts above that enchanters are the biggest pain in the ass to duel.  There is a 56 chanter that always is gunning for me, so I make sure to have DC on all the time.  We have never dueled 1 on 1, because she wont step into the ring with me alone.<br />
<br />
I have owned the guilds primeir Rogue EVERY time we have dueled 1 on 1.  He is 60, im 52 none of my spells stick to him but Spears and life taps.  Cancel magic is wonderful, and I just melee kite him with my Reaver.<br />
<br />
I HATE BARDS!!  Yeah if I know I cant get darkness to land, I just say screw this.  Nuff said, they own if you cant get them snared.<br />
<br />
Warriors/Monks = the suk in PvP, unless they have a friend. Then your introuble.<br />
<br />
In a major PvP event who do you go for first?  The Wiz's?  The Shaman/Bst's/Enchanters?  The clerics?  The melee's?<br />
<br />
I have found that being a melee, you go for the people that can cast slow first shaman/enchanter/BST's.  Then to the cleric's, then to the melee's if your still alive, lol!  <br />
<br />
This order seem's to work well for me and has proven it self over and over again.<br />
<br />
All I can say is to pray that you can get them single and own them.  <br />
<br />
Remember if they cant get you rooted or snared, they should not be able to kill you.<br />
<br />
Most of the time the pure casters will not be in the thick of battle so I immediatly SS to the outside of the battle field and start picken off the pure casters 1 at a time.  <br />
<br />
Mean while all the Gung Ho warriors and monks and rouge's kill each other off in the middle, and the Pure casters are focused on what's going on in the middle and wasting their mana nukeing/Doting down the warriors, they never see you behind them =)  <br />
<br />
I also play a Necro, and I have to say that it would prolly be a very close battle if I could duel them against each other, but I think my SK would win from the sheer amount of HP's and Very high resists.<br />
<br />
At 61 Necro's get the spell Touch of Majuki.  I dont acctualy have it yet, but ive been told a necro with that spell is unstoppable.<br />
<br />
Im rambling alot, sorry.  I will go now, take care all.<br />

I've dueled a bard, and while it seemed to take forever, it wasn't exactly hard.  I don't think he was a great bard, and that helped, it was pretty easy to trip up his twists.  A lot of it was me using arrows on him because he kept resisting me or running out of spell range every time I stopped long enough to cast a spell.  I ended up running further away from him just to force him to come back, hide helped in this as a few times he got close enough for me to slash and bash him.  For Bards getting bashed is very dangerous because it stops their songs and thus the buff effects (at least once they tick off) until they can get it going again.  If you can knock down their resists like I did and start landing spells it draws things to a close quickly.  Arrows will force them to keep twisting heal songs or accept the damage (crappy arrows from a Nightmare Wood usually do 30+ damage for me, and with a fleeting quiver fire fast... f*****g 75 archery cap).  They only way they can really do damage is to get close and that's when they get hurt.  Just don't path like a mob and you'll be fine.<br />
<br />
Any bards out there reading this don't get me wrong, I used to play one for a while and I think it's a great class, and against a machine they do a great job.  I soloed mobs at 20 with a bard that would have kicked my Shadow Knight ass at 30 if I was dumb enough to try (want to piss off a druid go solo the tainted and corrupt mammoths at 21 with a bard... then loot them).<br />
<br />
If FV allowed you to have more than 1 toon per account I'd still have my bard ( I refuse to keep two accounts... this IS only a game ).<br />

<br />
One win was against a Paladin 3 levels higher than me. I told him I had already used HT for him to accept the duel. I beat him down while he kept trying to blind me, to no avail. I Shadow stepped around, which confused him to where I could come up behind him and he then LoH himself. Then I just kept the Scream of Death up and kept meleeing til he got to 20%, then HT and he was down.<br />
<br />
Also I dueled a Warrior one time who insisted that I not use HT. I told him &quot;okay, then don't use duel wield. Just one 1 hs weapon&quot;. He told me that was crazy and I said &quot;exactly&quot; and kicked his ass anyway.<br />
<br />
The only one that was ever real close was against a Cleric who chain stunned me. The only reason he lost was because, well, he ran out of mana and I had him snared. :)</div></div><hr />
