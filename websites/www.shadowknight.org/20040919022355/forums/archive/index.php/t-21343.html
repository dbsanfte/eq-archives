<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ukbar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I currently have the Fulvous Darkscale Breastplate AC: +53 Str: +10 Sta: +10 HP: +60 Mana: +20 and trying to decide if I should spend Adventure Points on Call of Darkness (50+ ATK) and augment my Fulvous BP.  Or, should I skip getting the Call of Darkness and continue saving for a better BP?  <br />
<br />
I've been spending most of my time in POV leveling, just hit lvl 62 the other day, but will begin spending more time in LDON, and other planes zones.  Last night a shaman cast Ferine Avatar on me and the ATK increase resulted in significant damage increase, 1HS and 2HS skills both at 225, with 1HB, 2HB around 185, and thought about the damage increase from CoD ATK increase just might be worth it.  So, get CoD and augment current BP, or keep saving adventure points and slice and dice without CoD?  Any suggestions?   How many out there have CoD?<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

I don't know if I'm misunderstanding your post... but Call of Darkness is a lich type buff spell, not a +50 atk aug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">His point is that both cost adventure points, and he's wondering which to do first, I think.<br />
<br />
My suggestion would be to focus on getting the Tak BP to replace the cultural.  Then augment the crap out of it.  Then get Call of Darkness from Everfrost.<br />
<br />
That said, don't turn down Everfrost groups along the way; I think they're not as popular as the rest (well, excluding Guk).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I use my call of darkness spell all the time and was always happy I spent the adventure points on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>DConquest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I see...<br />

In all honestly I always felt spells &gt; gear.  The way I went was to get the LDoN spear and atk buff before I even tried to work towards any augs.  It was well worth it imo.  Whatever you decide don't neglect getting 65 over AA grinding.  Helps you get groups and the higher 60 spells are quite a boost in your DPS / tanking / pulling potential.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Berren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I went for upgrading the pieces of my gear that could use an upgrade from the Ldon gear.  Then I went for spells.  Call of Darkness was one of the first I got.  I was very pleased with result the 50 extra attack is excellent, and in most groups with a healer the lich effect is so small you don't notice.  Depending on your race you not even notice the lich effect at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Get the spell.   Spell will always be useful, gear can be upgraded.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i picked up the cheap version from rujarakan it was like less then 50 pts i think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I got the cheap version for 40 adventure points or so, I've used it a lot, that's what's convinced me that I need to get the real version.<br />
<br />
-Bolas</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">definitely worth getting unless you have a boxed ranger to for SotP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>NorrynNoir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">get the cheap one. it's 25 atk and like 30 adventure points so it's essentially free. yes CoD is better but that way you get your attack up and can still focus on gear which is also critical.<br />
<br />
cheap one is called dark temptation i believe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">the only trouble with just getting the cheap one is deciding whether 25 atk is worth the buff slot. 50 atk usually is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>NorrynNoir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">the only time you'd use it is if you didn't have ranger buffs available. if there aren't rangers around you're using the slot that would have dedicated to SoP, so i don't see a slot issue honestly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">my buff slots get filled pretty easily. a 25 atk buff would be something i'd drop pretty quickly when they're filling up... but a 50 atk buff is not something i drop often.<br />
<br />
anyway, even though the cheap one is by far relatively cheaper and a bigger gain/points, the expensive one is still not a bad deal and worth getting. it takes about 1300 AP to get 25 worn atk if you buy the vengeance augs, and the &quot;expensive&quot; spell only costs 410 ap</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Toothfairy_TP</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">You will get aura of hate soon. Thats 100 attack for group....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ziagwa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">But AoH only lasts a short period of time.  Call of Darkness lasts for an hour, and recast time on AoH is a long time.  When in a raid situation I use AoH for added ATK for other DPS classes in group.  But, either way use one of those spells, both are good IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Just got call of darkness.  I like it.  It's +50 to base attack which ends up being about 68 or so difference to my atk rating.  Since I don't care much for rangers (at least they aren't pallys or bards, I'll say that much for them) then I use the buff a lot.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>kharan_zechts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I really dont ever use it.. maybe im just lazy but even if there is no ranger around 50attk really isnt gonna make any difference.</div></div><hr />
