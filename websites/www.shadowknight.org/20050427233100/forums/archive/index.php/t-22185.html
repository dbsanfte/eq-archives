<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xenu_Hubbard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all!!<br />
<br />
I just have a few quick questions about SK and the troll race.  <br />
<br />
I saw that Orges can't be stunned from the front and I was wondering if this was true for trolls as well?  I saw somewhere it was for the &quot;big&quot; races but I'm not sure.  <br />
<br />
What is the exp penalty for a troll SK?  <br />
<br />
How hard is it to be KOS in most cities?  I want to roleplay an idea I have but I don't want to have to stay in evil cities too much.  <br />
<br />
Am I safe to assume that all my creation points should go to int?  <br />
<br />
Anyone play on Morden Rasp that can help me maybe?  I'm not looking for hand outs, I might have some questions to ask in game (I haven't played in a long while).<br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe I'll just be a gnome...................<br />
<br />
Thanks Sorry for all the Q's   =\<br />
<br />
EDIT:  Do the weak Melee stats really hurt Erudites much?  Are they KOS in the major good cities?<br />
EDIT 2:  What race is the most suited for soloing past lvl 20 or so?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Paynreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ogres are unstunnable from the front, trolls are NOT. Trolls get regeneration instead. The &quot;thing for big races&quot; you have heard about is the ability to Slam. Slam is the exact same thing as Bash, only it does not require a shield to be equipped. It even runs off the same skill (so when Slam goes up a point, so does Bash).<br />
<br />
I do not know the experience penalty for Troll SKs, but last I checked it was the largest penalty of the races able to be SKs.<br />
<br />
Being KoS in most cities is not a real problem. The ones that you will need to traverse most (Freeport, Qeynos) even have a sewer system for evil classes/races to sneak through without being hurt. And honestly, in this day of EQ you will ONLY need to go into those cities if you're questing (or, like you said, if you're RPing). Everything that you might do in a city, aside from quests, is doable in places like PoK where nobody is KoS.<br />
<br />
With cross-server tells you can ask any of us questions. Feel free to ask me, even though I play on Fennin Ro. Use this command<br />
<br />
;tell Paynreaver.fenninro XXXXXXXXX<br />
<br />
(Yes, thats a ; and not a / )<br />
<br />
The weak meelee stats of Erudites do not harm them after they get some good gear. Really, the race choices today only make a large difference with racial abilities. Erudites do not make bad SKs. (But gnomes do. Just accept it.)<br />
<br />
The race most suited to soloing later on depends on how you solo. Troll and Iksar regen will help with downtime, while DE and Erudite INT will help you cast more. Overall, any SK can solo well past level 20 as long as their gear is not completely awful for the current level. I did at least some soloing every level, and solo'd all of some levels, up to level 65. I play an Ogre.</div></div><hr />

Nope, this is an ogre only ability<br />
<br />
What is the exp penalty for a troll SK?  <br />
iirc, it is around 10%, but in practice, it seems to not make a huge difference (any trolls that can confirm or deny?)<br />
<br />
How hard is it to be KOS in most cities? I want to roleplay an idea I have but I don't want to have to stay in evil cities too much.  <br />
not at all.  Essentially everything you need is in your home city (Neriak), or PoK/Shadowhaven/Abysmal Sea, which are indiffernt to all races.  There is really no reason you should ever have to deal with racial faction except for the a small handfull of quests.<br />
<br />
Am I safe to assume that all my creation points should go to int?<br />
Put them in stamina, anything left over I would put into dex.  You want to max stamina as early as possible.  Stamina to tanks is as int/wis to casters.<br />
<br />
Anyone play on Morden Rasp that can help me maybe? I'm not looking for hand outs, I might have some questions to ask in game (I haven't played in a long while).<br />
There is a serverwide SK channel that you can check out for ingame questions.  serverwide.sk:sk</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kroolhand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I play said Troll. I hesitate to speculate on such things as frontal stun benefit at high levels as all my Ogre alts are level 25 or less, and additionally you'll get stunned fine and plenty by adds attacking from the sides while soloing with an Ogre. Slam question has been answered by others. So I'm basically gonna comment on the exp penalty.<br />
<br />
<br />
IT'S CRAP!! And if exp speed is a concern for you, be something else, even an Ogre will level noticeably faster. I am not one for numbers, but I've seen it posted on this board that the penalty was 20%. Iksars pay the same penalty for the same regen rate AND an AC bonus. Troll stats are decent melee wise but they are the dumbest big race, less intelligent than even Ogres, and as far as I know without looking at the creation screen atm, they are the dumbest of any possible SK race. Int isn't a huge thing in grps, as you can get by with casting CD only (if MT) or some taps and spears if not MT. But you will notice it when kiting or soloing in general. <br />
<br />
I would not give up my troll for any reason, but that is because I like his looks, his strength and there is a degree of satisfaction in being somewhat unique. You mentioned RP'ing and that will work fine for you as a troll, otherwise other races will level faster and/or be more efficient in the roles they perform in group or solo. Think of it this way: The complaint often put forward on this board is that SK's are second best or worse in most roles they are called upon to perform.....same with a troll. Want to cast evil across Norath? best to be a Erud or DE but ANY other race starts with more INT. Want to be a brute force wall of evil? Ogre. <br />
<br />
Regen and starting melee stats and possibly night vision are the reasons given for the big exp penalty.... Ogres have better stats, night vision becomes academic after ya get an item or spell to correct it..and as for regen...everyone regens well now while sitting and NO one regens well enough to keep them alive while fighting. <br />
<br />
I'm not entirely sure what penalty Erudans pay. A rl friend has an Erud Wiz and he bitches about the speed of leveling /shrug. I obviously haven't seen the end game, where there may be knowledge that refutes my opinion as to the efficacy of regen. Other than that, you might consider this scenario. Friendships in game are usually born of either rl friends starting complimenting toons at the same time as you, or you meeting people in various camps along your way. In most cases you will stay close enough to them in level to do things together throughout your toons lifespan. You will find that with a troll, you will have to invest more grind time or eventually be left to far behind to be an asset to them. This occured for me in the late 40's early 50's. On the upside, you will meet a lot more people, as folks on other race/class combos pull level with you and eventually pass you.......hehe so at 65 your 65 friends list will be longer than some. I suppose it coulda been said like it has been said on this board many times. Be a Troll only if you WANT to be. It's also been said that in the end, there are no real differences, but i would encourage you to recall that the end will be further away for you as a Troll.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Xenu_Hubbard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for all the great info so far!!!  After hearing about the exp penalty I'm now even more confused about which race to play.......  <br />
<br />
I guess it now comes down to faction.  I *want* to RP a &quot;reformed&quot; SK that while no longer warshipping death is forced to use his skills of death to live, be sort of a Dark Magic Paladin.  Which religion has the least amout of hate twards in in the wood elf town and Freeport?  And how hard would it be for a Erudite/Gnome SK to not be KOS anymore?  And would a troll be harder to do the same?  I'm hoping when I buy the platinum Pack to play on the RP server, but right now I'm using the free 30 day trial.<br />
<br />
Any other experiences would be great SK or not, but preferably evil class/races =)<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Paynreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">That will actually take some research because some races/classes/dietys are not able to get their faction with oppositely-aligned NPCs to a high enough level to trade, or even be non-KoS!<br />
<br />
You will need to find out if your chosen combination can even raise their faction with the Wood Elves high enough to do what you want.<br />
<br />
Also, you must understand that raising faction takes a LONG time and is very, very boring. Not to mention often hard.<br />
<br />
I really don't want to break up your RP dream, but I think it would be worse if you worked at it for months only to discover you cannot achieve it due to faction constraints.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Gnomes and humans have the easiest time fixing faction.  Erudites have issues fixing faction in &quot;good&quot; cities due to being solely CT worshippers<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that the religious differeneces may make it so that there are some NPC's who will allways see you as KOS.  Consider it the price of your former &quot;Death Worshiping&quot;.</div></div><hr />
