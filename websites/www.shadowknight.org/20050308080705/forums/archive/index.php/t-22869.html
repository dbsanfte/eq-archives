<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ezele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Awesome.  Just discovered that Sienn Kastane won't take my Wailing Sister Blood or Wailing Rune.  I did all the quest up to that point right and she responded fine but she will not take my items no matter what I do. Anyone have  same problem or something like it? I'm petitioning to a gm and bug reporting but just wanted to know. ty  :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shadoh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Did you have Inny's Curse on you when you tried to do the hand in? No clue if thats the problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Did you skip the Murkglider egg part?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ezele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yes i even put it on my main hand.  And yes i did do the breeder and had the quest done up to that point.  I even tried to say &quot;mask the blah&quot; stuff that started the wailing sister but got no response. =/ hopefully gm will respond soon. thx tho</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>ezele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">GM told me it was me not reading the script right but I am now quoting from my logs on the script and the items that i looted etc. Im prob just gonnna do the Wailing Sister again just to make sure (delete old pieces).  /sigh  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Honorhawk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I just had the exact same thing happen.<br />
<br />
I have not skipped any of the quest. I have the original SK epic 1.0, i got the egg got the book etc. I spent about 100k PP raising Tailoring to 180 to finish the combine on the sheath handed it in. Phew np...killed the frog handed it into the npc she told me to go kill the wailing sister and the MAsk the sword's presence etc...  I take my group kill the npc and return with the blood and rune. Hand them in and nothing. She returns the items with no text. When i say about the MAsks the sword presance she shuns me. If i hail her she says abotu the events transpiering etc.. <br />
<br />
<br />
Nothing else. Waiting on a GM now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>ezele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Omg thers another like me, ive sent 4 petitions now and nothing seems like its gonna work, i even killed the frog again.  damn this has gotten out of control.  So fustrating as well i could have had quest done 3 days ago.  However, in my infinite attempts at trying to solve the problem i came up with a good petition stating that is a flag issue.  I killed Fraga before i  did the murkglider and you must have done something similar as well.  It sucks a lot.  Even though it makes 0 sense i know ive just about killed gms over it and it probally is true, ther must be a flag check after you recieve the Wailing Sister quest and of course it fails because eq is gay like that and screwed me over and probally did to you too.  Hopefully the GM's will acually talk to me this time and not do the old comment and close the petition while im even on to try to avoid it. /sigh<br />
Well hopefully someday we can do this quest, post here if u get info and i will as well.  More people that complain the quicker it will get done.  :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>ezele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It seems like you have acually done it in order so my theory probally just went to crap  lol =/.  We will see what happens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Honorhawk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well she doesnt hand them back and say they are wrong, she just hands them back and says nothing.<br />
<br />
I tried handing in diff combos of them ie + Innos curse etc. And you geta message. But the 2 items together  nada</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>ezele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">no i get the same thing, nothing, I was refering to the gm saying i was wrong sry =p.  We have the exact same case.<br />
And yea I have tried many combinations for three days now and have even killed Fraga over again.<br />
nothing seems to work besides the petition button which doesn't get anywhere because they just want me to submit a bug report everytime and never give me a straight answer,  Im gonna be sure to write a comment about it with your information if you don't mind posting your character name and server.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>ezele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I am 70 and have been for awhile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Honorhawk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">i posted dont know what good it will do tho ;)<br />
<br />
Im having flash backs from the original epic quest being broken  and making some ppl kos to the epic mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>ezele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">so true =/ You beat me to it lol but mines pretty detailed =D. Hopefully we can get some more help on eqboards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>ezele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">hmm i did ding 70 during the Wailing Sister fight if that means anything...what about you?  Thats prob the only difference i had between the two parts of the quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Lufan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">You aren't the only one stuck. I know a guildie of mine is stuck on the exact same part and she started the quest at level 70.<br />
<br />
Sienn never said &quot;I don't need this item for now&quot; when you turn it in. So, to me, this quest is bugged for whatever reason. It is not our fault. The quest has problems if at least seven others are encountering the exact same problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Honorhawk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">So i did a petition, some GM-Trakviz closed it and said /bug it.<br />
<br />
Couldnt even reply and tell him that i allreayd had bugged it and are they aware of it and is there a fix.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>roxxyy0</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">having the same problem after killing fraga and tring to turn in his parch to sienn. i trade the parch and just get it right back no nothing. have epic 1 and have done everything prior to fraga before killing fraga.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>ezele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Has anyone compeleted epic 1.5 with the original epic?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Zeelot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I have the same bug as well - have original epic...It's quite frusterating because I would've been done awhile ago. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Honorhawk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I have finaly had a responce from somone at sony  and hes passing the info along and i sent the URL;s to this forum and the other one.<br />
<br />
With this mornings downtime i kinda crossed my fingers and preyd they had fixed it. However they hadnt. Guess i keep waiting ;/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Rimgruk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I helped one of my fellow guildees today on epic (he has 1.0 btw), we did Wailing Sister all the way through the Kithicor pally's, everything seemed to work fine with him...pretty weird how it's happening to a handful of people, yet doesn't affect another handful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Did the person who has the 1.0, that completed the wailing sisters part, do the part that required for people without 1.0?  Does it even allow you to do that part with 1.0?<br />
<br />
I know I tried to do Captain Varn part, and after he died, it would not let me loot the flamberge.  Did all the hails and everything prior.  So I cant even get past that part now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Honorhawk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Seems so strange to me. Wish they would fix it ... close enough to finish it in a few hours ;/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Rimgruk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Nah he did not need to do the pre-quest to 1.5 since he already has 1.0.  Was thinking about it, and this probably has no relevance to him being able to progress ahead, but I do not have 1.0 and i was grouped with him during the wailing sister fight and on, maybe having me in the group had something to do with it.  Of course I am probably wrong... but it's just weird how this is happening to certain people, and not to others (or in my guildee's case, it did not happen to him).<br />
<br />
Edit: btw I did the Captain part 2 days before patch, wasn't bugged so it's obvious that his asstastic hp/resist/dps tweak had something to do with the loot bug now, he was just fine before the patch...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Kendril D</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I did all those parts yesterday, wasnt bugged for me yay! Now i just need to kill the guy that hits for 3.7k :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Lufan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I knew someone turned in the Sheath without turning in the Egg, she just won't accept it and won't say a word. So the bug probably resets your flag from where you started at the beginning of the quest with Sienn knowing you have Epic 1.0; which of course explains why we cannot trigger &quot;The Wailing Sister&quot; since we are &quot;not&quot; flagged for her. If the GM's won't fix this, I am going to be pretty damn pissed off because I don't want to do the Egg and Growth ever again in my life.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>ezele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">im about to do the quest over again..I already have most parts of sheath and fraga's parchment.  If i ever get egg ill def try it again...i have a feeling its gonna take a LONG time for soe to &quot;fix&quot; this &quot;thing&quot; that the gm keeps telling me is not a &quot;bug&quot;.  I'm really sick of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Colous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I Hailed before turning in my blood and rune and the quest bugged, a guildy Hailed before turning in fraga's parch and it bugged.  I told another guildy not to Hail the bitch at all and he went through it with no problems.<br />
<br />
Anyone finish the entire quest with no problems and Hail her after turning in the egg?  At this point I'm guessing hailing is resetting the progressive flag back to the beggining.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Lufan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I never hailed her when I got the blood and rune and I couldn't turn in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Sithacult</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I have epic 1. Did every step in order. Killed Fragga handed in parchment and nothing. Sienn gives it right back and says nothing so I don't think the bug is just focussed on the wailing sister part its also happening during Fraga Parchment handin. <br />
<br />
For what its worth I'm lvl 67 don't think that has anything to do with this bug though. I'd also like to mention that I forced hard saves (Camped out) after each handin up to the point of the Fraga note. <br />
<br />
I bugged it hopefully it will be fixed by the end of the year..../sigh When is WoW coming out again :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Sithacult</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Hmm I also hailed her before handing in the Fraga Parchment, maybe thats why she wouldn't accept it. However I also did that when I handed in the sheath and that worked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>ezele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">hey guys, lol im almost done with all stuff AGAIN, i have egg and half the sheath done with and fraga parchment....also have wailing sister part.  Im trying again to do turn ins...Lunfan that scares me, are u positive? did you ever die during do ing the quest btw? cuz losing innoruuk's curse has also been a cause of the bug im sure, cuz u loose title and that prob resets flag.  Oh well, we will see what happens....i will die if she just like doesnt accept again  if i do over p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>sionya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Bugged as well on the hailing sister part, sienn won t keep rune and blood i give to her. did /petition , /bug and posted on the epic thread on SOE board.<br />
Hope it get fixed soon it is annoying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>ezele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">sigh, cleared PoG and no piece again, thats my second time and now its gettin plain gay =p rest of quest is ezy, hey im probally screwed to be bugged again anyways so hurray! :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Sithacult</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Hmm looks like warriors are also having a similar issue. Take a peek on the steelwarrior board. Last quest mob is eating their items. The frustrating part is that they actually got a response from the Dev's relatively quickly where they asked people to do the following.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can anyone who's had this problem send me their character name and server in a PM?&quot;<br />
<br />
I have bugged/ petitioned and have not gotten any repsonse back at all from anyone. We have yet to hear from anyone on our problem. It would be nice to hear a word from somebody on this that they are taking a look at it. I swear if I get the response &quot;you must not be following the script right&quot;... without even taking a look at my toon I'm gonna loose it. In my journal I have evidence that I followed the script right and Sienn is simply not taking the Fraga parchment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>ezele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">ya i know ur pain man, this is overall just a drag for me now, im helpin other sks on my server get it and like all of em gonna have it be4 me =/ i just want to get  that crap fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Zeelot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">I redid my whole epic from the start without hailing the npc's and I got my epic. So its definately hailing mid-quest that does it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>pogge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">They fixed a bug with monk epic last patch that was resettign the quest flags when they hailed some NPC ..  so we r not the only ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Nachti DarkAnger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">A GM just reimbursed me my questitems. gonna hand in them at the evening. lets see what kind of problem that is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>phaerun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">I am now at the final fight for 1.5 and I have only hailed the NPCs the first time I saw them. After that I just turned in the items they asked me without hailing them. <br />
<br />
worked fine so far. When I kill the paladin, I will also turn in the holy symbol without hailing.  :cool: <br />
<br />
dunno if they fixed it, but seems like hailing in the mid of the quest is bad feng shui  :p <br />
<br />
Btw I have died quite a few times mid epic, when I had the 1.0 on me and I was losing the title but it did not reset the progress of 1.5...<br />
<br />
Heared someone mentioning that the system does not count  items on your corpses as your possession so I simply banked the epic 1.0 and now I can keep my title all the time. <br />
I assume this &quot;feature&quot; was because initially corpses could rot, so you could lose anything on your corpse, but now with the new gy zone when you do not lose your corpses due to rot timer, I think they need to reprogram that part. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Nachti DarkAnger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">When you get your items back , or redoing the epic, it works fine ;). Got sheathed voice now  :D    wtb some dead sks ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Honorhawk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">So far the most epic battle of all the epics fights is going on at the moment, im trying to get a GM to log the hell onto povar and restore the items. Levelling 1-70 is easy finding a half competent GM around when you need one is almost impossible, I heard there are a lot out there but they are rare spawns. The Seniors on povar do a great job and work very hard shame no one supports them from above.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sorry Rant off ;) Ie no Responce regarding items yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Lufan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">I got an egg yesterday again, and I petitioned to get my items back.<br />
<br />
I woke up this morning, found out GM reinburshed my lost items. I did turn in without hailing Sienn and the other NPC. Everything worked. I got my epic.<br />
<br />
So for those doing their epics before Sony fixes this part. At all time's do not hail the NPC's. You can hail Sienn before you do everything, that is fine. But after that, do not do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Sithacult</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">How did you actually manage to get your items back? I'm surious what you said to get them to do that. The only response I got back was that I'm not following the quest right, which of course is absolutely BS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Lufan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">First time I petitioned, they said I didn't follow instructions. <br />
<br />
So this time I petitioned saying that I actually lost my items; kind of like quest person ate them, but I didn't say that. I gave them location, date, time, all the names of the items I lost. Pretty much I am trying to get an reimburshment of items saying that I lost them instead of saying the quest is bugged. Then I elaborated and bullshitted (like I spent so much time on it, etc) a lot like you do in HS and College. The items that I recovered were egg, parchment, and sheath.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Iosif_McCloud</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">But the question is did the quest work after that or are you waiting for the patch</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>ezele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">yes it did for him and it soon will for me.  Its confirmed taht doing over the quest will unbug it. DO NOT HAIL SIENN KASTANE. thats all that matters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>vex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">O man, now I read this. I went up last night and turned in Inny voice, ok fine, got text. <br />
<br />
But then... I hailed her, and she gave me that don't bother me stuff. <br />
<br />
I went up and got the egg quest from Maelin and he talked to me. <br />
<br />
Think I'm ok??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Kendril D</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">Yes, i did the same and im done with everything except the final fight.</div></div><hr />
