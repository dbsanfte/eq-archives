<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Skvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This must have been asked a million times but my search for vexthal and combinations of other key words produced little of note :(<br />
<br />
Anyone have a link to a decent guide to soloing the VT shards as an SK ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Its been a while, but this is what I remember.  I did most of them solo in NToV and Ssra gear.  It really is very straightforward.<br />
<br />
Ssra - You'll get a ton when your guild clears the mines for green ore.  Should get more than enough to cover everyone in your guild.  Otherwise, its very straight forward.  Single pull, tank it till dead.<br />
<br />
FG - Set up on one of the cave walls and pull the Royal Guards (any of the mobs near that dead end in the caves really).  Bring a healer partner.<br />
<br />
Akheva - Flop to to SW corner of the room just before (east of) the Vah'Dyn's room.  There is one alien there.  Kill it and set up camp.  The triggered trap mobs can drop the shard, and any of the rock dudes in VD'd room.  Kill the trap near the arch to VD room, then pull mobs from the room to your corner.  Easy to straight up tank.  Warning: the name escapes me, but theres some rock dudes in the VD lair that have about 50x more hp than the rest.<br />
<br />
Grey - Revs, kite them or whatever.  Easy.<br />
<br />
Seru - Mine came from the gaurds right at ZI, dawnshroud side.  Some people say the drop rate is better if you go up to the catwalk, but the adds would be a pain solo.  Just take 15 mins to clear the ZI halls both sides while you head to another camp, eventually you'll get the drop.<br />
<br />
DSP - easy, pick up the rot from someone farming hides.<br />
<br />
Deep - Flop to the bridge.  Actually, iirc, since the revamp the mobs on ZI side dont see invis anymore.  Whatever.  Horrors are easy to tank solo.  Might want to bring a couple friends to make it go faster.<br />
<br />
SD - Easy, kill the revs or pick up rot shard from exp'ers.<br />
<br />
AC - Might need a heal partner for this.  Move to the inner area.  You hvae to click on a porter to take you in.  Sit at this spot and kill bloodguards.  The drop rate is good.  To get out you need to go up some stairs and click on another porter thing.  Sorry I dont have a map to reference directions.<br />
<br />
ME - Kite gorangas until named pops.  I dont remember if nameds summon.  If they do, you'll need a healing partner at least.  This would be much less painful with a full group because of the rarity of nameds.<br />
<br />
Again, theres no special tricks to any of them.  Just go and try them out.</div></div><hr />

you can also do katta for your seru shard. invis to the 2nd floor of the church and start killing guards, should be able to straight tank them. took me about 15 minutes to get a shard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Drop rate sucks on the ZI side of the bridge tho, go over the invis bridge (either a) fear the shroom (most fun) b) harmshield down and walk up the ramp on other side  or c) use in-game map to see the bridge. Then go south along the cliff wall until you get to the horrors there, easy single pulls, extremely easy kills, drop shard lots.<br />
<br />
Oh, and there are see invis mobs on the ZI side too, they're just rare. You can stop and kill them or inch past them or flop past them, anything goes. Not like you should care, really.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Excessium</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">At Level 61 I was able to aquire shards from The Grey, DSP, ME, SD, solo-style. ME took me a while since the dude gated a couple of times. Other then that, use a partner. I was one of the few who enjoyed shard hunting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Oagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Aye, that thread on Shaman forum is about the best out there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Doomhulk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I came upon the named in ME from the camp of gorganas by the dawnshroud peaks zone. I soloed the named by pulling the whole camp, snaring the named, fear the others, then I FDed and just meleed dotted and life tapped him to death then finished with HT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Oagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Shard does not drop off the Gorgangas by the DSP zone, unless you mean where the scouts are.  The group under the trees does not drop the shard.  Shard named gorgangas spawn where scouts spawn.</div></div><hr />
