<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Davistus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, i was thinking of possibly making a poll, this might be a stupid idea. Seemed interesting to me. Just put down the following and reply, this way everyone can get an idea where their level SK's are hunting for exp and possibly get new ideas. <br />
<br />
<br />
 Level<br />
 Who you hunt with (duo, group, etc.)<br />
 If duo, what class.<br />
 What zone<br />
 Where in that zone (what camp, location, etc.)<br />
 Average exp there<br />
 <br />
<br />
If theres any other details you feel like adding, feel free. Just thought it might be useful, who knows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Most people don't have a 1-track mind.  They don't have one spot in one zone that they frequent with one group setup.  That in mind, it'll be hard for most people to answer your questions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">That is not a bad poll, sometimes people get into ruts and may want a change of scene.<br />
<br />
Lately I have been doing mostly LDoN, but am looking for a nice place to fear kite again. <br />
<br />
Also, I did some PoD, but I really do not care for the zone. I go there since you can usually fear kite the flies / rats.<br />
<br />
As an add-on, where are the low 60's going to solo / fear kite these days?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nyrvel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">- Level 60<br />
- Group (usually WIZ, CLR, PAL, BST...last spot ::shrug:: :)<br />
- Veksar<br />
- Highborn camp or Theatre<br />
- If full group 2% Xp or AAXP, if 5-group 3% XP or 5% AAXP<br />
<br />
Need slower to do this! :) Or be on really good terms with CLR, they will have to heal you lots!<br />
<br />
- Level 60<br />
- Duo (WIZ)<br />
- Sebilis<br />
- Sepsis Scarabs<br />
- NA (only here for the Loot, usually gems) :) <br />
<br />
Hmmm, with WIZ nuking, you can get to camp then med...after that just kill at your leisure.</div></div><hr />

Try Akheva zone in.  Can pull mobs to the zone in T, festering, invoke, and you and your pet can beat them down. <br />
<br />
These are not to hard, so if you just want to toe-to-toe with them that works too. They don't hit to hard really. I'd say about half of them are still blue to 65.<br />
<br />
Good source of Luclin tradeskill items also (baking, smithing, and poison making). Once in a while you get lucky and they can drop centi weapons - even the long swords.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gargar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">JUST found a good place to go. I was actually getting quest parts for the BoP and comatose spells.  In the hidden caves in dulak. Fairly fast repops. Dropped tons of stuff that was worth 1-10pp and a lot more gems and whatnot that i would have ever hoped. <br />
My group was me another SK (51) and a cleric (56 i think). We made quick work of them, had our pets up of course. <br />
<br />
I was pleasantly supprised and will continue to go back and farm ever after i get the parts for the comatose spell (we both ended up getting the luggald organs to get our spells)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nyrvel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Gargar, in the Luggald cavern you mentioned, be on the lookout for a Luggald Assassin, drops a really nice item your CLR will appreciate. He has a ton of hit points and hits fairly hard, 56 CLR and me (55 SHD) took him down after 6 CHeals. ::shrug:: Otherwise, it sells for decent and goes well with all the other Loot you get. Good Hunting! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ramgar SK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">63<br />
duo or group (sometimes guildies join in)<br />
Enchanter<br />
Flies in PoD, at the safe rock (straight north over goo from zone in)<br />
Exp is slowing down a lot since some of the flies are light blue at level 63 (and troll), regluar 1% of exp avery 5 kills, 1% every 2 kills at level 56 with a human enchanter.<br />
<br />
This used to be one cherry of a spot, until they started turning light blue for my sk.  I can still PL my enchanter there though, and it's easy a pie.  I don't fear kite, just tank em.  They are easy and die fast.<br />
<br />
I also really like going to Torgiran Mines, at the Nadox zone in.  Everything here is blue to me at 63.  The problem here is that it's a big pain to get there without a druid/wizard, and you fill up with weapons really fast.  Just about every one of them drops a weapon.  Exp here is moderate, not as good as the flies, but the loot has really good potential.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Izus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">For solo AA xp<br />
I kill some time if I'm stuck lfg in PoD at the bone wall.<br />
Most of the mobs are solid blue (a few biles are light blue).<br />
I just pull whatever I see that is single. Some of them you can fear kite others I just aggro kite until I want to melee. Pretty safe and I get ~2% AA xp per 3 mobs sometimes it takes 4.  Not the best place but it's easy to get to when waiting for a group.<br />
<br />
I also duo with a necro when I want a change of pace in Veksar.  With the necro slowing the undead and popping heals my way it's very easy.  Lately most camps have been taken so we end up at the church/warlock camp and keep that area clear and try getting some of the named spawns.  It's a nice spot since I really only need self buffs and don't worry about C3 or Virtue. Xp averages around 50% of an AA per hour. Not the greatest but some of the loot sells ok. (oh...all these mobs are casters as well. At level 65 without resist gear on most spells don't stick even when one of them lands a malo on you)<br />
<br />
Other than that it's groups in BoT, Tactics, LDON.  I prefer Tactics when I can get a group there since I average an AA ~ 1 1/2 hours.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Izus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Interesting observation last night. My necro friend needed 10% to get his next AA for an advance and it was late so I took him to the spot in PoD mentioned above.  <br />
<br />
With him I was getting 1% AA xp per kill unless we got a light blue goo.  Xp was moving very fast with him.  I ended up with 33% AA xp in 20-25 minutes. Granted we were still buffed pretty well but C5 did run out after a few pulls so I was using death pact for the rest of it.  I'll be using that spot to top off AA's with him whenever we can.<br />

I usually let the necro do the hard part and gain agro, so I can act as the 'third' pet and kill mobs faster. As stated before, Tact is approx an AA every 1.5-2.0 hours, depending on our kill rate.<br />

That's interesting, according to SoE after they made changes to the experience system, adding a sixth person should not change the exp modifier for the group.  In other words, whatever exp you get per person in a 5-person group, should be what you get in a 6-person group.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Nyrvel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Lizarde and Savoline, I can only tell you based on the percentage changes as seen through my UI. I know the percentage gains because my 65 CLR and 65 WIZ were wondering if I was getting XP/AAXP and how much...if I can find my notepad I was using that night I could give you a kill-by-kill breakdown. :) I usually only worry about XP gain if it drops below 1% per kill, but that night I was actually planning to be a smart-ass for every time they asked me how was the XP. Was going to rattle of XP gains per kill when I noticed the difference and paid closer attention to 5-group vs. 6-group. As a consequence, when we lost our 6th person, I was not so inclined to pick up a replacement. To quote Hudson from Aliens, 'I'm reading it right, man!'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Jodgrim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">That's interesting, according to SoE after they made changes to the experience system, adding a sixth person should not change the exp modifier for the group. <br />
<br />
As I understand it, the xp modifier goes up when you add members to your group from 2 - 5, and 5 it is 80%(I think). What that means is that when you kill a mob you get an extra 80% xp to spread among the people in your group.<br />
<br />
When you add a 6th person the modifier does not go up, meaning that you are still getting mob xp+80% but the number of people you have to spread that number among goes up, so you get less xp per kill with a 6 person group than you would with a 5 person group.<br />
<br />
What got me was Nyrvel getting the same amount reg xp per kill as AA xp in a full group when there is a difference of 2% in a 5 man group. Seems like there wouldn't be. (I think that was what Savoline was asking about too.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The exp per person is the same from a 5 person group to a six person group (not taking into account the affect of your level posisition relative to the rest of the group).  SOE made a special statement when this was added explaining that yes they do understand that they are fabricating new exp but basically it helped people they didn't figure anyone would complain so they didn't care either.</div></div><hr />
