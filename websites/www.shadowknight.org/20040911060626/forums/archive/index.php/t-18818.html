<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mortalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">1) on Sullon Zek (Top heavy PvP server)<br />
2) my friends will be making a group of 6 including:<br />
-Ogre Warrior (Tank)<br />
-DE Necro (DPS)<br />
-DE Rogue (DPS)<br />
-Human Bard (Bard stuff, you know what I mean)<br />
-DE Cleric (Healer)<br />
-ME - SK (DPS + off/backup tank)<br />
3) Even tho the server is top heavy we plan on leveling fast and joining their ranks, it isnt really that hard so please respond knowing I will eventually - pretty far off I know - be reaching end-game)<br />
<br />
was thinking DE, <br />
1) Ive heard that they level the 2nd fastest of the SK possible races (Gnome being first - according to eq.crgaming.com)<br />
2) At lower level it really wont matter what stats are, the important ones will eventually be maxed out<br />
3) The regen races (Troll, Iksar) are the slowest leveling races<br />
4) According to some people who post here the &quot;look&quot; gimp, w/e tho I hate the way trolls and ogres look...<br />
<br />
what do you guys think?<br />
- Other race considerations are Gnome (Due too xp speed) and Human (another race I think that can look bad ass)<br />
<br />
only constructive input is welcome, and is appreciated...<br />
<br />
ps. Female or male? Im a Male IRL but I like the idea of other dudes dying to a female and feeling ashamed (keep in mind, red server) - it really doesnt matter but might as well coment on it too...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Pick male - don't be a mangina.<br />
Sounds like a DE heavy group and poor Mr. Ogre will be left behind in the leveling.<br />
Tons of DE's though, can you Erudite and still be on the same team?<br />
<br />
Though SZ was a teams server....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>xorrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">A slower wouldnt be a bad idea, you dont realy need a slower but it would help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">aye, I would think a shammy or chanter would be a nice add for that team...but if you want a SK, a couple things to consider.<br />
<br />
1) Do you want to cast more or melee more?<br />
2) Since your Warrior is an Ogre, a Ogre SK would not be bad since you will both level at the same speed<br />
3) If you are planning on be secondary tank, the Ogre &quot;unstunnable&quot; ability is sweet.<br />
4) Also, the Troll and Iskar regen is very nice too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Droyt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm playing a troll SK and a halfling cleric on two computers, both always grouped.  Halflings used to level the fastest and troll among the slowest.  I got them both to level 52.  The cleric has 9 AAs and the SK has 8 AAs.  The SK was started when the cleric was already level 20.  There does not seem to be much difference in xp at low levels (yeah, level 50 is still low level for me).  Maybe I'll see a bigger difference in their leveling in the next phase of the leveling game.<br />
<br />
As a final thought, don't base your choice of race on the amount of xp needed.  What really matters is that you can play a race that you'll enjoy for a long time.  I've played both a human SK and now a troll SK.  If today I was given the opportunity to change my race I'd probably go back to a human SK.  Yes I'd lose the regen and the ability to 2-hand bash.  But I'd have an easier time moving around.  And I would have the bonus, yes, that's right, the bonus of not having an innate vision modifier.<br />
<br />
Most of the game is lit and in those few cases where it's pitch dark you can use deadeye or the other vision spell for infravision or ultravision.  But most of the time you are fine and you can much better appreciate the graphics of the game.  No, not spell effects but the sky, lands, cities, etc.  Make a human and a dark elf shadow knight and go to Neriak and see the difference for yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mortalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The bard will have to suffice as a slower...<br />
<br />
I made my sk and he is level 37 now, the rest of the group will be getting on sometime this weekend and I will have to pl them till they catch up... might have an enchanter or wizzard join us...<br />
<br />
Im still in the sol a xp range so once they can group with me catching up shouldnt be a problem... if It is Ill just ungroup and work on skills...<br />
<br />
I ended up casting as much as I melee, I am the designated back up tank, the ogre unstunable ability is nice, but it wouldnt have gotten me what I thought I would get out of it (spells not being interrupted in melee). compared to being interrupted by movement (when I get hit) I almost never get stunned, and channeling helps with that (which is somewhere around 180 now)...<br />
<br />
everything looks good so far, thanks for all your help...<br />
<br />
ps. and he is a male so no mangina, lol</div></div><hr />

Turn while casting it helps keep spell from being interrupted</div></div><hr />

Is this true ? Like, confirmed true by shmaart people ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Situationally yes....when you pull and you are going to cast turning  forces an updateof your your position with the server.  So if you are running stop and turn you'll never get interrupted due to the server mistakenly thinking you are moving.  My shaman always turns (usually 45 degrees oneway the turn back and 45 degrees the other) when casting even if he wasn't running.  It seems he gets interrupted less but THAT part may be a placebo, I've seen no proof on it.  However turning quickly after running then casting DOES help prevent interrupts</div></div><hr />

Yeah... well, thanks for telling me what is welcome...<br />

<br />
Don't know when I pissed in your weaties, but I just noticed this line in your sig... Well, junior, you can say it here.  &quot;Groff Gorespiller can eat a DICK!&quot;  Don't beat around the bush, you panzy.  If you hate me, proclaim it to the world and get on with your life.  I sure don't give a flying fuck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sandmann Dreamcatcher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">hmm so you choose to play a evil SK on SZ,<br />
<br />
there are some thinks you need to look after <br />
<br />
-Erudit  much int  but weak, no night vision<br />
- human  a bit of all  , no night vision <br />
-Gnom   small hard to taget in pvp  much int  but weak <br />
-DE  much int  but weak <br />
-Troll  big  maybe problems in dungon  low int  but strong and regen got slam<br />
- ogre  big maybe problems in dungon low int  but strong  can not be bashed in front  got slam<br />
- iksars bit of all  ac boni regen but cannot waer all stuff <br />
<br />
 <br />
if you go only for the stats you need to choos  what youlike  more int  or regen or ... <br />
<br />
for myselfe i found out  i had a DE  SK  and  i deletet him because i do not like  to play him (dunno realy why)<br />
now i got a Iksar SK  and i love him,  he is the big evil  like a real SK. and i can better roleplay withhim  than the DE. made some nice quest  for him like the greenmist ...<br />
but this is only what i have choosen for me you need to see for youre selfe. <br />
<br />
take the Class/Race combo  you like  most and do not  hear so much on other people. nothing more sucks to play a char up in the 50´s or 60´s and  see you not like to play him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jaggnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Good gear can overcome all stat differences between the races, but what it cannot overcome is: <br />
<br />
1.  Ogres can't be stunned from the front, at the cost of a 10% experience penalty. <br />
<br />
2.  Trolls and Iksars get increased regen, at the cost of a 20%  experience penalty. <br />
  <br />
Other than that, choose your race based on your personal preferences or the conditions of your play environment.  <br />
<br />
   Jaggnar<br />
   54 Ogre SK of Xev<br />
   Order of Seibwen</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jodgrim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">1. Ogres get a 15% xp penality not 10<br />
<br />
2. Stop bumping old threads</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Mortalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">wow lotta replies, yeah I made him DE and hes level 57 now...<br />
<br />
may have to restart over though, now that I know what DEs are like I might rethink what race I will be...<br />
<br />
I found out about the turn while casting thing on my own, stops you from running forward after you let of the forward button so yeah it helps (confirmed)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Let's set aside that many people have slumps in thier 50's...<br />
<br />
You're on a  teams server, but I'll assume (and pretend I know something about this) that either all SK's are on the same team or that you can find a way for every race to be on the same team.<br />
<br />
You aren't thrilled with the DE.  Erudite and gnome will offer you similar experiences, being physically low but high in other areas (Erudites haveing a Int advantage and Gnomes having a dex and a couple other stat advantage)  I'll assume the high minded SK isn't your cup of tea.<br />
<br />
So you got the human who is well rounded, the iksr who move you further towards the tank SK (though I have been told the limited selection of plate items wearable by iksar can occasionally suck donkey ass).  Then you have the high physical end with the Orges and the trolls.<br />
<br />
What do you like about your toon, what don't you like?<br />
<br />
Ogres and Trolls would tell you that if your first instinct wasn't that race (Ogre or Troll) then you shouldn't be it.  So you get Iksar or Human.  Make sure every stat is at least 75 base then all to Sta and rock.  Enjoy.</div></div><hr />
