<br />
we have formed a new guild after splitting from the old and there are several non Ele-equipped people now. So we are looking for easy farm encounters solo/duo/grp. One of the best things so far is definately the chest after you kill the captain in the luggald caves for pre Epic 1.5.<br />
Are there any other known mobs with chests for pre-epic/epic that will spawn known?<br />
<br />
thx for any info/link</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Crynus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">from what i've seen, there seem to be chest mobs in other classes epic 1.5/2.0 quests as well.  Perhaps try skimming walkthroughs for the other classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sadandroid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">looked through about 10 boards + - only infos on walk through not on loot/chests. Thought maybe if someone with his/her guild is making the new epics, they might have some info. My guild is starting with the SK 1.5 epics - which is pretty fine with me  :D</div></div><hr />
