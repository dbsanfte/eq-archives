<br />
Found this posted on a server website for recruitment (not FOH):<br />
&quot;The following are the requirements and desirability by class. The current average lvl in PN is 59.16. There are NO exceptions to the lvl requirements unless a person receives a unanimous vote by the officers of PN. <br />
<br />
Class-------Desirability--------Minimum LVL<br />
<br />
Cleric-------Very High------------56<br />
Rogue----------High---------------59<br />
Wizard---------High---------------59<br />
Mage-----------High---------------59<br />
Warrior--------High---------------59<br />
Ranger---------High---------------59<br />
Monk----------Average-------------59<br />
Bard----------Average-------------59<br />
Shaman--------Average-------------59<br />
Enchanter-----Average-------------59<br />
Druid---------Average-------------59<br />
Paladin-------Average-------------59<br />
SK-------------Low----------------59<br />
Necromancer----Low----------------59<br />
Beastlord-----Very Low------------59&quot;<br />
<br />
Personally I don't care how SKs rank.  Having just made GraveLord, I can burn through AAXP more then twice as fast as my L60 Druid.  I can survive things few other classes can (FD), I can sneek by mobs easy, I have a 1100 point snare dot, I can lifetap for over 300 healing 2000 health on ToV mobs, I can harm touch 1400+ damage, instant invis with my CoS, I can solo explore most places, I can tank mobs real well,  have an awsome pet at L58, great at corpse recovery, pull as good as any class and kick ass!<br />
<br />
Having played a Monk to L56, Warrior to 50, Druid to 60 and a SK to 60 I can honestly say that the SK is the most well rounded, funest class to play.  And I absolutly can't imagine why anyone would rate SKs low on raids.  Unless maybe they have some very lame SKs in their guild or have a lot of Pallys who dont want compitition for 2handers.</div></div><hr />

My guild only takes apps from level 60 players. Anyways the problem Sks have with raid guilds is just about every other class has something they bring to a raid. As a class the SK cannot offer anything special to a raid force. Paladins bring DA pulling and DS buffs. As well as some decent group healing and LoH to start out a CH chain. We bring zippo as a class. Mayby a exceptionally skilled player who is a SK can offer some stuff to the raid that have nothing to do with his class and be desired. But as a class we dont bring anything to the table.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Byttorr Ebonknight</div><div class="date">03-30-2002, 03:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I wouldn't say that as a class we bring NOTHING to the table, we just don't bring anything unique. In every raid I have participated on recently, I have been relegated to the leftovers group, the fat kids' team, whatever you want to call it, and been disgruntled by it. However, in each of those raids I have managed to step up and make a contribution to the raid in a crunch situation. MA warrior loses aggro because an enchanter tashes, I can get the mob off them before the warrior can. MA went LD and all the others were standing around with their thumbs up. I step in to take care of business, and did so well at it the enchanters, shamans and clerics howled when the warrior returned. I MA'd for the rest of the raid until it got to the bosses when defensive was needed. Ugly CR because hostile mobs are lingering around? No problem, got it handled.<br />
<br />
Our class is only &quot;low desirability&quot; because we're not flashy and people only focus on what we can't do, not what we can. What we have to do is step up when we can make a difference and just sort of kick back and be alert for those opportunities. To use a sports analogy, we're like a pinch-hitter or a relief pitcher. We may spend a lot of time &quot;warming the bench&quot; but when the moment arrives, suddenly people are glad to have us around. The only trouble is, they tend to forget what we can do until it's another clutch situation again. ;) Fame is so fleeting... <br />
<br />
I love the SK class. I do sometimes find myself bored on raids because others don't understand what we can do, but I more than make up for it in non-raid situations. As a former ranger from back when they were outcasts (notice their desirability rating on that chart now), I find it wonderful when I receive tells from strangers offering me groups. We might not be so desirable for raids, but smart players love us for exp groups and dungeon crawls.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I personally don't play this class because I'm needed in raid or anything, but because I have fun with it and like to be able to do as many things as possible just by myself.<br />
<br />
We still have interesting things in raids:<br />
*Torrent of hate: all melees in groups love to have this on em, especially rogues and monks<br />
*Drain soul: you can do 90% of Ntov without needing one single heal thx to this puppy, you can go in a group with no healer and lets other melees go with pallies<br />
*HT: when things go wrong, when mob has one pixel of hps and when it starts to eat clerics, ask for a click and HT the shit to death. Yes everyone will say &quot;HT is crap it does only 1k dmg&quot;, but I don&quot;t count the number of times I got killing blow on a mob juste after I thow (naked) my 1k unresistable DD in its ass.<br />
*Good melee dmgs<br />
<br />
Indeed not enough to be in &quot;needed classes&quot; but enough to not feel useless.</div></div><hr />

How the hell is it that Rangers get a &quot;high&quot; rating? And as another thing, personally I'd rather have a well played anything than a badly played Cleric. (Or any other class... that's just the highest rated).<br />
<br />
Grr... I hate that stupid rating thing. It's stupid. Yes, perhaps SKs are low on the &quot;desireability&quot; poll... but stating it creates unecessary biases... since Rangers are &quot;high&quot; does that mean that I should invite one into my group before a SK? Doubtful... <br />
<br />
Whenever I'm playing a chanter, and the group I'm in is &quot;seeking a Tank&quot;, the first thing I do is /who all Shadow LFG, then I randomly send tells to any SKs 55+ (no real reason why that's the cut-off... just seems that most places we need a higher level tank). That is of course after I've checked to see if any of my friends are on. I don't look for Paladins / Rangers and even Warriors because I know my survivabilty increases 10fold with a SK in my group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">trun</div><div class="date">03-30-2002, 08:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Every guild has their priority of what classes they want. Most guilds that have an established base would most likely want a select few, namely dmg(more dmg always good) and clerics(can't go wrong). Our lack of desirability is mainly because we don't do any buffing and do good damage ONLY if well equipped(hi primal). We have other uses(back up pulling, cr), but it really does depend on the guild you're in. ie. if you have 5 monks, you're not gonna be pulling.<br />
<br />
There's no point comparing ourselves to others really as long as you're having fun. I've gone thru the whole 'did i pick the right class?' thing many times over and have a billion twinks, but all they really do for me is show me how self sufficient an sk is and how much fun they are. Try playing another class, if you find you like it more, then an SK isn't for you really. We're an acquired taste.<br />
<br />
As for the fat kid being picked last, look at buffers; I get picked over them all the time on open grouping raids and I think it sucks even more for them. Lazy clerics will pick the sks all the time since they don't have to heal us half the time.</div></div><hr />

I don't look for Paladins / Rangers and even Warriors because I know my survivabilty increases 10fold with a SK in my group.<br />
<br />
And edumicate you I shall<br />
<br />
A ranger recieves a high desireability due to their high damage output coming from trueshot, decent weapons (despite being shafted on luclin ones), strong bows, CoP, SoN, CoE, nukes they can use effectively if there smart, snare (hi aggro), weaponshield, and small healing capability.  Also if your in a high end guild your rangers will have 1300+ ac (some of ours have 1550ish maybe more), so while not a true tank they are capable enough... nearly on par with a knight.<br />
<br />
Since a ranger is high should you invite one before an SK? If you have tanks then yes, unless its a choice between an above average ranger or worse and an SK with a Flamberge (maybe palliadus/blade of angles... never used either so I cant judge it), your group will gain more damage output from having the ranger with you, also the ranger can break mezzes with higher aggro faster and jolt it onto the tank, gains you a couple free hits (regen it back) and less likely the enc will be hit.<br />
<br />
Something I said a couple weeks ago regarding Pal/Sk abilites to manipulate the hate list was &quot;Paladins gain aggro easier, SK's lose it easier&quot;, this doesnt mean we suck at gaining aggro... quite the opposite actually, but with stuns/roots a paladin can break a mez and ensure its on them much easier than the SK can.  We can disease cloud for high/fast aggro and I think its more aggro than any paladin spell, but you risk breaking the mez as well as making the mob unmezzable for 5 minutes.  Your survivability isnt 10x higher with an SK than a Paladin, in fact I would say the paladin would keep you alive better as one of the roles theyve been given is as the groups &quot;protector&quot;, they have that targetable 200 point rune, cc, lay hands, prexus, roots, stuns, and a couple other fast save your ass tricks.<br />
<br />
As far as the whole skill vs class thing goes (well played sk vs badly played cleric) for guild recruments.... I can guarantee you that any upper end guild looks at how well the person plays, honestly though clerics arent hard to play... im certain you could train a chimp to play a cleric well enough for raids within a day, and it could perform the job as well as 99% of the other clerics in the game<br />
<br />
Dont take this to mean im saying that SK's suck, or that pal/rng are superior to us, as im not saying this, just dont believe your better than them when you arent... I would say were fairly equal (although SK's lack a true raid use... hopefully this is fixed soon)<br />
<br />
Oh yes, heres another desireability list, personally I dont agree with theirs (mainly the requirements they listed for sk's) but its another viewpoint.<br />

PS. forgot to mention, desireability is a mix of what classes bring to raids and how many you currently have</div></div><hr />

Doing a guild exp trip to the pit in VL I showed one of our monks, just how much of a better puller i was then him.  he was having trouble split some of the named areas so i just self runed and pulled the old &quot;dark park&quot; out fo the bag 8D.  As for raids I may not get grouped first, unless it is PoH, PoF and they want to make sure that atleast 1 FDer gets up in case break goes bad, but i sure aint picked last.  One thing we do bring to raids is &quot;parking&quot;.  MA loses aggro for what ever reason and get get mob back in position then I step in and put it where we want it.  Simple to do and all I have to do is a few of our Torrent spells and bang mob is there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
--------------------------------------------------<br />
PoG RAID<br />
55 peeps in attendance.<br />
My first time ever there.<br />
A 58 ranger was MT and a 58 SK was ST.<br />
We eventually pulled Treah Greenroot and right before we did, the ST either left or went LD.  I get a /tell from the Raid Leader that I'm ST.<br />
The MT dies in about 20 seconds and I'm left to tank for the remaining 10 minutes til its dead...and I survived.<br />
Now I know I survived due to slows and cleric heals, but the whole point was I was chosen above warriors, monks and paladins in attendence because the raid leaders knew SK's could hold aggro and tank.<br />
This was a favorite moment in 3 years of playing EQ. :D <br />
--------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Now, this is not to say SK's don't need some specific attention at levels 59/60 from Verant's perspective.  Some new spells that make us more desirable for High end Raids should seriously be considered.  ShadowKnight selfishness is nice for Roleplaying purposes but that's pretty much out the window in this discussion.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Razza</div><div class="date">03-30-2002, 12:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">sk / pals are good for getting fast aggro, like its needed when multiple mobs at once attack ur raids (rings....)<br />
<br />
sk / pals can tank most stuff in the game, there s very few mobs they cannot tank, but of course that depends on gear too, and well having defensive warrior tank is sometimes better for mana reasons =)<br />
<br />
pal can buff/heal, sk can do more dmg vs mobs ( xcept undeads ) and heal (but only himself)<br />
<br />
with the mass of ring like encounters there is a raid use for pals/sks, however most guilds are used to have lot of warriors and let em do this job. mostly because those warriors have the leet gear so even with faster aggro, why should they invite a bad equipped sk/pally ?<br />
<br />
having a warrior tank adds in rings is like having an SK tank in ntov, yeah it works and just fine, but it could be done more *effective*<br />
<br />
btw BoCs are the devil, warriors with that sword can outtaunt sks easy if they dont have bad luck on procs =/, but well, us hybrids dont have to rely on proccs, we just get our aggro fast with spells at will.... not luck.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rikkar</div><div class="date">03-30-2002, 01:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">for me it's not a matter of being at the &quot;cool kids&quot; table or whatever, its a matter of wanting to help my guild.  I've been in my guild since about level 3 =P cause i had a few IRL friends who snuck me in at a low level.   Now that i'm 55 and raiding 3-4 times a week i wish i could contribute more then i do to the guild... don't get me wrong, we CAN contribute, but it's almost always a secondary roll... i'm normally secondary puller (if 60 monk dies or can't come) and ST if we don't have one of our 3-4 59+ warrs present, for example i MT'd a very small raid to explore ssra last night, did just fine and only healer we had was a 60 cleric (didn't go to far, stoped after a few basement mobs and then did a bit upstairs, so might have been harder things lurking about).  But i can definatly see how sk's would fall sorely behind in &quot;uber&quot; guilds where there is no need for secondary roles... because you have every class present.  Realy all i'd like to see is a unique purpose for sk's so that i could really contribute to my guild (only sk we have, what a surpise)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Groobash</div><div class="date">03-30-2002, 02:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Who cares? Play the game. If your class doesn't bring anything unique to the table, bring it from behind the keyboard. Find other ways to contribute to the success of your guild/raid. <br />
<br />
I view the people who create lists like these as the same clueless dipchits who turn down SKs in pickup groups in favor of warriors. They don't understand the class and are too stupid to think for themselves. I also wonder about the SKs already in some of these guilds and wonder why their guilds' leadership has such a dim view of adding more.  /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chania</div><div class="date">03-30-2002, 02:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The trouble is simple, we don't have the killer app, like a CH, CoH, massive nuke or damage. In almost every situation where all you do is attack the mob, the raid would be better off with a rogue than you there.<br />
<br />
Sure, I know all about the things we potentially can do, but the reality of the matter is, in most raids, I'm a long term self sustaining dot on tappable mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fluxurak</div><div class="date">03-30-2002, 03:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used to think high end SK'z where getting shafted (well, we are most times) because we aren't unique.  Reguardless of this, I have pulled SEVERAL of my guilds raids now.  If there is no Monkey, it falls to the SK (and I'm a big phat ogre too boot).  The other day in kael area, I pulled that.  Why not the Monks?  Simple, unlike everyone else, I CAN SNARE.  Snare, drag the mobs away, let others mobs go home a wham-o, a nice mob waiting there too be tagged.  'F' a bunch of monks, lets see them pull that fast and efficiently w/o FD'ing 50 times.<br />
<br />
Also, I end up as SA/TA (we almost always have 60 warr's available) lots of time.  We can tank in a balanced grp/raid just fine, and I'm sorry, a 55 SK(hell, pally) can tank better than a 60 ranger.<br />
<br />
Also, no offence, but NO pally or other class for that fact can get agro off me if I choose to have it.  That stupid ass DC we have; 2 casts of that will piss it off far more than stun (I've found).<br />
<br />
I REALLY think we get shafted a LOT, (especially epic), but if you make yerself useful, yer ok.  I get stuck in the &quot;Short bus&quot; grps sometimes, but usually I'm at the top of the raids list and have proved myself over and over that I can do as much and more than these other bishes.  And necro and Sk low desire?  These people must NEVER wipe in raids.  <br />

Paynreaver, those 3 things wouldnt help sk's in the slightest... also group feign death doesnt fit in with sk's as its a spell that  directly helps others, we already have to many spells (in verants eyes) that do this<br />
<br />
Chania, let me know what you think of this idea i had/sent in, for a raid ability for sk's considering that we cant have spells directly benefiting a player and this sorta fits in as a debuff... an entire spell line thats basically reverse runes, unresitable spells we can cast on a mob which for one of them say stops the next 500 melee damage the mob deals out</div></div><hr />

<br />
On top of that though, I have a few questions... and more-so than that... a few comments. I didn't mean to compare SKs to other classes, we're like the guavas or the papayas to the fruit basket. Different from the apples and oranges, and perhaps not entirely necessary... but still a great addition. (Trying to use the lame &quot;apples and oranges&quot; connotation).<br />
<br />
The reason that I hate those sorts of ideas is that it creates the unnecessary biases. People think to themselves &quot;Well, Afterlife doesn't want SKs, so lets get a Ranger instead&quot;. Granted (and let me stress this), I play on Mithaniel Marr, I'm friends with several AL members and my guild graduates many members into their ranks... most of these guys don't feel that way. But because it's on the website, it's the way that many others take it...<br />
<br />
Personally, I play my SK because it resembles many of the things that I do in &quot;real life&quot; (what the hell is that anyway?)... I am the watcher in the shadows. I watch... see where I can be helpful and jump in. I do the thankless job that people don't recognize. Despite our evil ways, we are a humble class (imho)... there is nothing that we're fantastic at that can be logged or really even viewed... but if you've grouped with a great Shadow Knight... you sure as HELL know it.<br />
<br />
Bah. I'm rambling... basically I'm just saying that I play my SK and I'm content with my role as the Shadow... I just don't want to be passed over because of what an &quot;Uber&quot; guild posts on their website about the desireability of certain classes in their guild. Granted, yes... Rangers can bring the pain a bit more than we can... but pair me with 2 Rogues and they'll land EVERY backstab as soon as it refreshes... and that's more viable than a ranger anyday. (Again... all ideas are opinions expressed by myself only...)<br />

Just my .02cents... which I'll need back soon... 1-800- COLLECT doesn't reach Norrath.<br />

<br />
This guild puts Ranger in top list because it needs a few more so they allways have someone to CoP melees.<br />
When they get their 2 more rangers, the class will suddenly drop to bottom of desirability wich doesnt mean the class is bad but that they just dont NEED more.<br />
<br />
If guild allways have 1-3 Sks in every raid, sorry but they don't &quot;need&quot; more and if they want to raise dps, then a Rogue is a &quot;better&quot; choice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ghob Owar</div><div class="date">03-30-2002, 08:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm... ok I agree with that. The desire to have those classes listed will indeed decrease once those classes start to be in the guild...<br />
<br />
However that doesn't take away from the people who aren't in the guild seeing that. What's to say that (reminder that I'm only a lvl 35 SK) a group who has seen that listing won't take a Ranger over me in a mutt group? Or even say a Paladin... not because of my merits (and not counting me as a player)... but what about the people who haven't yet made a name for themselves as a &quot;good player&quot;. Will they get turned away from the group while the Ranger (who also hasn't made a name for him/herself as a &quot;good player&quot;) gets the call simply because the &quot;Ubers&quot; say that they're more necessary? <br />
<br />
I guess that's what I'm getting at in terms of my dislike for that system... I can understand the &quot;need&quot; factor. And the damage factor and several other factors that come into play when deciding what is &quot;necessary&quot;... but when that's posted it (perhaps) detracts from the rest of our 'playing ability' because of the unedumakatid. :)<br />
<br />
Perhaps there should be a recruitment outline like that... but perhaps it should be kept to themselves... that's all I'm saying.</div></div><hr />

Monk can FD better, Necro can Dot/snare, and lifetap petter. Warrior can tank better.  But SK's are stil the only class who can Snare/Instant invis/FD/piss mobs off/ and 2nd best tank in the game.  In most situations Monks are better at pulling but in some situations SK's might be better in pulling since we have the Instant invis and snareing cappabilities.  These are hard to see when people are just looking at the class and the class spells seperately and I DO think we NEED raid friendly spells.  Every other class (maybe not BL) has something unique to contribute to raids...Even Magicians now =)<br />

They both have other options and standing invites to bigger guilds. (and yes, I am one of the two)<br />
<br />
There are a quite a few 57+ SKs who might be GLs soon and this might change, but for now GLs on my server are not having a hard time getting picked up by larger guilds. <br />
<br />
You don't even have to be good at this point...you should see how clueless a couple of the SKs I have seen get picked up lately by next tier guilds. I *know* they didn't get picked up cuz of their leet skills. LOL<br />
<br />
I also think most guilds post stuff as general guides more than hard and fast rules. If a guild stumbles into a recruit who obviously knows their stuff, they're probably gonna grab them. Web sites sometimes also don't get updated frequently.<br />
<br />
I don't think things are as bad for SKs as those two lists portray them to be, at least not on the Trib.</div></div><hr />

Well, isn't this exactly a rune? Whats reverse about it? In the end, it does the same thing, it negates 500-700 damage, just like a normal rune. I doubt we would get such a powerful, targetable rune.<br />
<br />
I think the line we should be pursuing as SK's is a debuff that actually does something, maybe a flurry debuff or rampage debuff of some sort, something along the lines of a mega cripple, or even better, a massive STR drain or debuff that weakens a mob so that his max damage is lessened by 3-5 percent, STACKABLE by multiple SK's.<br />
<br />
And don't gimme that crap that 10 SK's could reduce a mobs max hit by 30%, so what. 10 clerics make an encounter trivial, hell ONE shaman can slow a mob's melee by 70%. If you could even find 10 level 60 SK's on one raid, you should get a prize.</div></div><hr />

Now my guild has recruit another 2 Ranger's my Sk will be moving back to my main.  I can tell you first hand a Ranger's utility and damage output is what makes them desireable.  The reason you can keep agro from a Ranger is because he is doing what he can to control his agro, they have DC equilvent in Flame Lick and Snare.  I rarely cast snare on a mob until the mob begins to run for that reason, Flame Lick is only for saving casters that get a bit overzealous. Bashing a class because one guild wants or needs some not very productive.<br />
<br />
I find focusing on playing my chosen class is better than focusing on the shortcomings and advantages are of another class. Yes I do acknowledge we need to understand their shortcomings to be effective in our grouping with them but you also need to understand there are situations where that class may be more desireable. Another advantage I will have now is that when I go on Plane Raids with my guild I will not have to worry about losing roll to someone on Umbral or Noct armor drops. Yes we still have open roll as we are not big enough for merit system yet.</div></div><hr />

As I first posted, I wanted to learn WHY they were listed as more &quot;desireable&quot; than SKs. Personally, I think that they're a viable class that with AA points have really come quite a ways in the last year or so even.<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm not saying what I mean properly... hmm. I'm not comparing SKs to other classes in terms of skills, just in terms of what some people deem to be &quot;desireable&quot;. I totally concur with Groobash that if said guild sees someone that really knows their stuff, they'll grab them in a heartbeat regardless.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">synnoira</div><div class="date">03-31-2002, 09:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">my impression from idly looking at uber guild websites, FoH, the Harmonium, etc is that their major requirement over-and-above class is the ability and desire to raid in every moment of your spare time<br />
<br />
&quot;ubers&quot; are people with a streak of monomania in their personality (like any sportsman who plays their game to a high level) if you have that kind of personality and play your class well<br />
i find it hard to believe you won't get picked up by an uber guild if that's how you approach the game<br />
<br />
but if you don't want to raid six or seven days a week worrying about invites to uber guilds is pretty theoretical since you're playing, by choice, a very different game to them, and playing a class which is very effective in all but those sorts of encounters<br />
<br />
i hope &quot;uber&quot; sk's get a spell(line?) which gives them a more unique or desireable role, it makes no sense to me from a fairness or gaming viewpoint that any class has roles which can be entirely duplicated by others in those encounters<br />
<br />
as for worrying about people who pass you over in pick-up groups or such, do you want to group with morons? and it's once in a blue moon i meet somebody who says &quot;sk's suck&quot; or some such, thinking about it only two people in game have been dumb enough to say that to me (though maybe everybodyelse was being polite lol) and both individuals had practical demonstrations of their ignorance</div></div><hr />

<br />
As to the better off with a rogue statement.....<br />
<br />
you will never replace a rogues damage, but you will absolutely destroy a rogue in independence.  No rogue can survive the fights you can with only a regen from the handy druid.<br />
<br />
When your taking 400 unresistable a pop the best the rogue is going to do is regen around 30-40 pts a tick.  He'll need healing within the first 2 mins.<br />
<br />
A shadow knight can push close to double that regen, and sustain it for a long fight, if you can keep your buffs thru the fight, you'll need about one honest to god heal near the end to survive it.  The only class that avoids or sheds damage better than us are necros, and largely for the same reasons.  But, you have to WORK to be able to do it, it doesn't just come with being a SK.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 If you enjoy a large raiding guild and have friends there, great... if you like a smaller guild or no guild at all more power to ya.   either way, just play the game and have fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brega</div><div class="date">03-31-2002, 11:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shadowknights, much aligned, least understood......<br />
<br />
If the only goal in EQ is pure damage output killing big mobs, then yes, the Shadowknight takes a backseat to other classes.  Heck, the only melee damage dealer ya by pure damage output would be rogues by that standard.<br />
<br />
But, there is so much more to SK's.  <br />
<br />
-  No one, I mean no one besides matchup with the SK in PvP (assuming same level and relative gear comparisons).  I destroy Warriors, laugh at rogues and chase silly casters until they finally unplug.  SK's are the king of PvP.<br />
<br />
-  I'm sneaky.  I have invisi, invisi to undead, levitate, and FD.  There's very few places I can't explore in relative safety. (and don;t forget about the Circlet of Shadows!...invaluable!)<br />
<br />
-  I'm the only tank around that really doesn't require a healer to be effective (fungi, plus epic, plus minimal uses of lifetap abilities make this so). <br />
<br />
-  I can solo with ease and I make a great puller/tank for almost any group.<br />
<br />
-  I have the best horse (AXP) in the game.<br />
<br />
Bottom line is, the SK is versatile and deadly.  I don't have quite the damage output of the rogue on big mobs, but that's not the only measure of class effectiveness.  Who can calulate how much my Shroud of Pain, Torrent of Hate, Torrent of Pain Vortex Shadow etc added to the raid's ability to kill the mob?  That value the SK adds, is not easily quantitatively figured into that equation, but surely exists.<br />
<br />
Long live the SK!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ghob Owar</div><div class="date">04-01-2002, 12:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yesterday I was in The Overthere and my group consisted of 4 Rogues, me and a Cleric. For over 3 hours we chain-pulled into the lungs of hell and turned the cuisinart on &quot;PUREE&quot;.<br />
<br />
I held aggro against all 4 Rogues backstabing, including for 1 who was 5 levels higher than myself. The cleric actually remarked that he was &quot;bored&quot; because he only had my health bar to watch and he only had to cast heals about once every 5 or 6 minutes (even with 3 mobs hitting me at once... which I was also keeping aggro for).<br />
<br />
THAT to me is what makes us great. I don't care to do the melee damage that Rogues do, or the casting damage that Wizards do (or even Necros/Shamans for that matter). What I do care about is playing the best Shadow Knight that I can, maintaining a great group... and keeping people alive in my own SK-ish way. At the end of a three hour tour of leading the rag-tag group of slashers... we had each leveled and gained at least 2 yellows into the next level as well. Everyone said it was one of the best groups they'd ever been in and complimented me by saying that they all had to work on their defense skill because they'd never been hit while I was tanking.<br />
<br />
That is why when I play my Enchanter, I'll rather have a SK than any other tank class (unless on some uber-epic raid). That is why I chose to play a Shadow Knight. That is why I love this class... and that is why people need to be educated about us. I preached for the entire 3 hours (/grunting about the powur uf Shadder Nite), and they all left a little wiser and saying that they didn't realize what we could do.<br />
<br />
THAT's my reasoning behind being SK and my reasoning behind not wanting to see posts that almost &quot;bash&quot; us saying that we're low on the &quot;desireability&quot; poll.</div></div><hr />
