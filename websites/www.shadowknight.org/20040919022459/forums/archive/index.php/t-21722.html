<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>aress</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Question: For several months in the Future plans section , there was a blurb about reviewing shields:<br />
 <br />
(I pulled this from Future Plans, November 2003)<br />
 <br />
Shields and blocking<br />
<br />
We're planning on reviewing the possibility of giving an innate chance to block when using a shield. We've been hoping to do this for a while, and it should be getting a realistic review in the near future. We'd like to increase the value of shields, and make it a worthwhile choice for players who might normally dual-wield weapons or use a two-handed weapon. We plan on balancing this against classes which use shields by default, and therefore wouldn't be making any trade-offs to equip a shield. <br />
 <br />
 Can we get some kind of update on what happened with this? It just disappeared with no feedback as to if anything was done, if it's still planned, if it was scrapped, etc etc.<br />

 The information I received...<br />
<br />
&quot;This was idea from long ago that we never really finalized. Shields do help more than most players realize - they increase your AC cap directly - but this is still a possibility. Various other game and class balance issues have and continue to take precedence over this.&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Baaguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What &quot;AC cap&quot; are they talking about?  There never was an AC cap, just a point of diminishing returns where the curve representing the AC protecting you from the curve of the mob's ATK crossed.<br />
<br />
This quote is just like saying &quot;wearing a BP increases your AC cap directly,&quot; pfffft.<br />
<br />
My personal observation is that any time a dev mentions an effect but does not provide hard numbers, they are speaking out their ass.  The reason we &quot;don't realize&quot; how helpful shields are to us is because they are not that helpful, duh =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kahntun Derstand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah, I think that person meant that they increase your AC, not your cap.<br />

They need to do something about shields.  I'm using one now because I'm undergeared for GoD, but I hate it.  The perceived dps loss I took when I switched to a Cudgel just drives me nuts.  I cannot wait to get a real 2 hander going again.</div></div><hr />

 If your AC is high enough, then yes, a 50 AC shield will help you more than a 50 AC breastplate.  The benefit increases as the AC on the shield increases - it isn't a static bonus.<br />

Still can't figure it out.  Is it a modifier that scales?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jovec</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">TSW has some more developer comments on the effect of shields and AC caps in this thread (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=7643).<br />
<br />
From that thread:<br />
<br />
Orginally posted by Kavhok<br />
The cap on AC in the Velious era wasn't a soft cap; it was a hard cap that had been there from day 1. After a certain point, which differed for each class, the benefit of more AC didn't just diminish - it dropped to nothing.<br />
<br />
The change I referred to, just before PoP, changed that from a hard cap to a soft cap. You get a percentage of the amount over that soft cap. Shields increase both your total and your soft cap, making them more effective than any other item with equal AC. Your mitigation AAs, level, and class also affect the cap and the percentage return for AC over it.<br />
<br />
Separate from this, there are diminishing returns if your AC is much greater than the NPC's attack. This is due to the nature of the formulas that produce the probability distributions that have been well documented on this board.<br />
<br />
Does that help?<br />
<br />
- Kavhok, SOE<br />
<br />
And also interesting.<br />
<br />
Orginally posted by Kavhok<br />
3) Yes, the mitigation AAs will not do anything for you if your AC isn't high enough. However, the median level 65 warrior is over the cap even with both Luclin and PoP mitigation AAs maxed, so you can safely assume you're getting the full benefit out of them.<br />

Im in the same boat you are :)</div></div><hr />

They are just using that is an excuse for leaving Shields broken for all these years, and never doing anything about it.<br />
<br />
:p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I'm shocked to hear that Shield AC means more than any other gear AC. I don't think I see any parses on that before?? I think I saw parses that 1h/shield knight got more damage than 2h would due to increased ripostes by small degree.<br />
<br />
Suppose shield AC worth more than 2h AC then its still a moot point cuz of ripostes alone due to the fact that 1h is generally faster than 2h. Adding damn riposte resistance on shield so 1h should get LESS or EQUAL amount of ripostes that 2h would receive. They should be LESS if shield AC is same as 2h AC. <br />
<br />
Heh, I still find it hard to believe that shield AC worth more than 2h AC. I just need proof..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Chania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Nocifer was right all along! 1h + shield is the way to go! LOL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">but I finally got myself a decent 2hs weapon. I have to go get a 1 hander and a shield? :(</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Pfft. I am not right all along, you silly. :) I only do 1h/shield cuz of RP purpose and my long-time role as full time puller. Nothing more. We already all know that 2h outperforms 1h/shield in most area except pulling where riposte drawback on 1h/shield is minimized.<br />
<br />
I just think developer said it wrong or something unless SOE proves us wrong with hard proof.. We surely saw no visual improvement from shield mitigation for long time against 2h AC mitigation. Maybe SOE is right about shield AC being worth more but I'm sure its *VERY* small to notice..</div></div><hr />
