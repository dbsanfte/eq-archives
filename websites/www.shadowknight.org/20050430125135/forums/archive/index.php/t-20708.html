<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>gankaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">hey all,<br />
<br />
i was just wondering if you could suggest a good solo spot for me at level 24. i'm kind of twinked out...have a fungi, frostreaver, and some other quite good stuff. thing is...i just came back to eq after a really long break, so i kinda dont remember a lot of the good zones, or know many of the new ones, for my level.<br />
<br />
basically i just wanna know a good spot for me to solo at now, how long i should stay there, and where you think i should go after im done at the first location<br />
<br />
thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also HHK still has constant groups on many servers and you can ride out there until 35 (or go there occasionally when soloing gets boring)<br />
<br />
Grouping gives better exp, especially since they changes group exp rates to promote grouping.  No new areas for you except maybe LDoN adventures.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>gankaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i was under the impression that nagena had been made much more difficult...?<br />
<br />
also i had thought of doing LoIO till 26 or 27, then going to the ent. or cazic thule until 30, then goin into splitpaw until about 34, then startin to do LDoN. yall think this would work or no?<br />
<br />
by the way i was wondering how you usually find pickup LDoN groups...do you go to PoK and look or go to the zone in which the adventure begins?<br />
<br />
thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ramgar SK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">PC is good til 25/26.<br />
<br />
LDoN's are best found at the WF camps. Use /ooc.<br />
<br />
Also use /lfg and put the LDoN you want in the notes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Nurga has been made more difficult.  I haven't notice Najena difficulty going up at all.<br />
<br />
You're plan is good, it you have a healing or slowing buddy Gunthak beach rocks for exp at 34ish.<br />
<br />
LDoN is allright you'll get descent exp there but splits suck, drops are rare and exp there drops precipitously after 45.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>gankaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">well my buddy is gonna start playin eq again and hes gonna be a shammy(verant banned his previous account with a 55 epic'd shammy...said he was &quot;signing on others accounts&quot; which i know is not true because i know him) so i know we'll make an awesome duo...<br />
<br />
well if my plan works until like 45...where should i hunt afterwards? i mean sure id be able to go to the planes soon enough but wouldnt it be kinda hard to get a pickup group for in the planes...?<br />
<br />
of course im not really factoring in that ill prolly be in a fairly good guild at this point...but yeah....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">at 45 with that duo look to LoY and Work your way into Nurga.<br />
Should take you to the mid 50's, by that time the planes will be esier to find groups in AND you can make a group in Droga if you find a few others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>gankaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">LoY...? what's this one? sorry if i seem like an idiot...just(not sure if i mentioned this or not...pretty sure i did) came back to eq so lots of the newer zones are unknown to me...thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">LoY = Legacy of Yekesha extension<br />
5 zones that when they came out people dissed because the risk greatly outweighed the reward.  Mobs hit hard and have a truckload of HP.  Well several expansions later and now the gear has made the MoBs quite reasonable.<br />
<br />
Gunthak is the first zone - it's off of stonebrundt  Good mid 30's to early 40's<br />
Dulak is 40's - 50's<br />
Nadox is mid 40's-late 50's<br />
Torgian Mines -50's<br />
Hate Fury - 50's - 60's<br />
<br />
Good named, descent drops, good quests (your shaman will need to be there for a while for the stoicism quest - good Heal over time - most mana efficent and largest heal he'll be able to get at that time - think a mini Q).  Keevel's Pearl ring and bow came from Nurga to give you an Idea of the drops there<br />
<br />
Other zones-<br />
Nurga is also descent 40's and 50's - quests and nice drops<br />
Edit: Keevel's earring of pain and the boots in his inventory (not what he is wearing) are from Nurga</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Cantyanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I keep hearing LDON gets crappy exp starting in mid levels.  I'm 53 and have just started to do LDONs regularly. While some of mine suck, I can still get decent experience, esp when we get out of there quick.  I usually end up doing low collects.  The speed and experience depends on the group.  If you're the lowest lvl in the group, you'll get better experience.  I've found there to be better loot in N Ro and Everfrost than BB, but i typically get around 30 to 60 plat a split.  I know this isn't great, but considering the other place i typically hunt in PoJ, it's not bad.  <br />
