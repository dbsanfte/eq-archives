<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>gruupie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A couple of guild members have been asking about getting groups together for LoY spells. I might as well get Comatose while I am at it. Can anyone give me a runthrough of what I need to know. Is it a quest and does it involve camping?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Knight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Allakhazam Quest Info (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2406)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I don't know how familiar you are with the Luggald caves in Dulak harbor.  Savoline posted a picture somewhere around here a while back that's decent.<br />
<br />
Basically, what you'll need to do is this:<br />
<br />
Enter the Luggald cave area (through the secret door in the zone wall, if you have the map from www.eqtoolbox.com it's very easy to find the door).  I'd suggest invising up at the zone line.  Move down the main tunnel to the bridge.  Cross the bridge and keep moving down the main tunnel until it veers right.  Follow this tunnel to an open cavern with a waterfall.  Move around the left edge of the waterfall (the only way you can go, really) to the door on the right side of the cavern.  Open the door, enter the next room.  Move down the stairs (either left or right, doesn't mater) and head to the door in front of you.  Open the door, move into that room and turn to your left or right.  Move back to the corner.  This will be your camp spot.  I did the quest solo at around 62, but if you're lower, you'll want a group.  Set up, get buffed up, whatever.  This is a safe corner (or was for me, but mobs were almost all light blue and green at the time, think I might have seen a single dark blue).  When ready, move to the door (but don't open it).  Pull the nearest mob on your left side. Kill, move to the center mobs, then to the right hand side mob nearest you.  Clear in that pattern and just keep killing.  You may need crowd control, depending on your level.  All of the mobs came singly for me, but again, they were mostly light blue and green.  Any luggald in that room can drop the bile, saliva and blood.<br />
<br />
It took me around two hours to get all three solo, and I never had any problems with them unslowed.  I pulled with Cascading darkness, dropped a lifetap dot and Ignite Blood (I think, may have been Aystole) on them before they got to me, then pulled them back into my corner to kill, with Dr. Bones whacking them from the back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Oagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The walk through and/or discussion on Allakhazam's tells you where to go quite well.  If you're getting the spell at level (51?), I do not believe you could solo it, and I'd probably recommend a similar level group.  The xp will be good, and gems drop regularly, so it's fairly profitable for players of that level.  <br />
<br />
I believe I did mine at the room at the second hallway to the right past the bridge.  There are about 8-10 mobs spread out through the room/cavern.  Two will be at the entrance, another 1-2 at the first fire, 2 at the middle fire, and 2 at the end fire.<br />
<br />
The mobs will come in pairs at time, so root/mez or assign another melee.  You can get a named in this spot as well, that drops a dagger, if I'm not mistaken.<br />
<br />
I 2-boxed it with my 65 shaman when I was 51.  It was a pretty tough camp at that level, which is why I'd recommend more if you and your friends are of similar level.  The lugguld caves don't drop a lot of gear, but the gem drops are pretty good, and if you keep going in the caves, you will all come out with a fair amount of diamonds, bd's, sapphires, and rubies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Pretty sure the spot you're talking about is the DoT quest item drop spot.  I camped there for a while, never got the comatose drops until I went further back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kyfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Small warning. I somehow got hung up on the wall exiting the secret cave, bounced up and down a bit, then 20k'ed. Make sure you walk through the center of the opening.</div></div><hr />
