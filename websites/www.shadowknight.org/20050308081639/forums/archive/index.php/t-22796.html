<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Trebla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Decrepit Hilt (Magic, Lore, No Drop) dropped from &quot;Girplan Devourer&quot; in The Bloodfields.  Assuming this is for SK Epic since y'all used Decrepit Sheath in original epic.  Sorry if this is duplicate info, just wanted to help y'all since we stumbled across it.<br />
<br />
He spawned after killing &quot;Girplan Slasher&quot;s and conned red to 66.  Quads for 2000ish, has an AE G Flux with 1 slot dispel and an AE DoT.  Rampages, Flurries, unsnarable.  Took him down with about 20 EP geared folks not knowing what to expect.  He died with only casters and priests left alive though, another minute and we wouldn't have lasted...  oh yeah, he had a lot more HP than the Slashers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kalendrox Grimblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Were the slashers PHs or was he triggered when you killed a a set ammoutn of them?  Did he spawn at their corpse, or did he spawn elsewhere?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Trebla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Slashers were triggers.  When I arrived, there were 4 up.  We killed 3 on Tuesday night and the Devourer spawned.  Only had one group, so we wiped at 95%.  Came back Wednesday night with 20 and Devourer was still up (20 hours later).  3 may not always be the magic number though...  only one sample.  When third Slasher died, we got some text like &quot;A monstrous beast emerges after sensing several of its kind were killed&quot;<br />
<br />
To get there, from the Dranik Scar zone, leave the castle and hug the right wall until you get to an arch.  Go under the arch, turn left and go up a hill (hugging the left wall).  The Slashers are on this plateau.  The do not see invis and do not roam from their spawn points.<br />
<br />
The Devourer spawns further along the wall.  A part of the chanter epic (War Caller Kaavi) is between you and the Devourer.  War Caller is not targettable and will not attack until you kill 4 &quot;Sentry of Kaavi&quot;s that are around her.  War Caller is one groupable though, simple fight even though she's red to 66.<br />
<br />
There's a safe spot just past the Slashers before you get to the Kaavi mobs.  Neither War Caller or Devourer dropped anything other than epic pieces.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Bah, fixed days, forgot what today was.</div></div><hr />
