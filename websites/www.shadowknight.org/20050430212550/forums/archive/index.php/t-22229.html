<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, our little mottley crew (no VT/ST/Elem+) stumbled through the Sewer trials somehow and found we could enter Vxed now.  I have 2 questions, if I might:<br />
<br />
1) We'd intended to flag everyone through the trials, thinking this is how it worked (that everyone had to be flagged) to go beyond them, but found that we could get unflagged clerics camped at the zones to enter by using /rz commands.  We'd tried this in the sewers of course but was surprised it worked in Vxed too.  So my question is, do we need to 'backflag' everyone?  Generally if a certain 4 of us don't go, no one else will be anyways, other than pickup groups, etc.  Will not flagging everyone affect us later on somehow?<br />
<br />
2) Short of a much-needed shield upgrade (hoping for a Pockmarked some day), I am about the end of the road for hp/ac which isn't that hot but has been adequate thus far.  We have zero warriors and zero paladins in guild, so basically it's been just me.  Haven't died to a named or boss yet (credit that to 2 healers, not my gear/ability) but did my share of wiping on bad pulls.  Peeking in at Vxed last night and fighting 10 or so mobs before calling it a night (okay okay, more like wiped on a 2 pull that ate the clerics) and seeing yellow con mobs, etc. -- I have to ask if we're about as far as we can go, pretty much?<br />
<br />
Should we go to back and stick to pharming the sewers?  Seen only 3 named total, and we've seen no spells, no augs, and I think chain arms and caster neck so far.  Or should we try to go on until we can't?  We know the end is soon, just not quite when.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No you can go all the way to KT.  Just takes some strategy and some patience and some luck too.<br />
<br />
Now with vxed you can rogue drag people in a rez them to get the flag.  You do have to be fast though as the respwn is very fast and trying to hold that spot with 4 people is a nightmare.<br />
<br />
So prob best to not even try this.  Btw this has been nerfed in Tipt.<br />
<br />
I have seen a lot of boxers and unguilded groups in KT.  I am guessing they are some unguilded regular xp groups.  Most of them in bazaar/ldon gear so it is entirely possible.<br />
<br />
Vxed farming can be productive for spells but I suggest getting the flag first as going after the named usually means a trial loss unless its on the way there.<br />
<br />
Once you get to KT the spell drops are much more common and should not be an issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Saruton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">For KT you need Vxed and Tipt and (Smith Rondo or Sewer Trials 1-4). There is no piggybacking into KT, you want to go there, you need the flags.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Daerkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Firstly as far as the flagging goes, to enter KodTaz everyone needs to have completed both mountain trials (vxed/tipt) and have either Smith Rondo flag or all 4 sewer flags. For sewer and mountain trials only the expedition leader needs to be flagged for the specific expedition requested - so totally unflagged peeps can be added to do vxed or tipt for example. For progression to KodTaz and beyond you will obviously need to flag everyone eventually.<br />
<br />
As to whether you should continue on through Vxed and Tipt I would say definately yes. The yellow mobs hit for no more than the blue mobs in my experience and if you have 2 competent healers with plenty of mana you should do fine. I box Vxed a fair bit to gear alts and use a bard to pull so its easy to always get singles, and I ensure they are slowed on incoming (bard slow is better than nothing if you don't have an enchanter for insane pet dps). Speaking of enchanters you don't mention if you have one available - if you do I would say Vxed is a done deal for you, and Tipt also, though both can be done without - just substantially more of a grind. For flagging in Vxed if you can get a bard in you really never need to leave the zone in - I flagged numerous characters by killing at the zone-in until the npc popped. Then levi and invis, and throw up bard speed. Run high on wall like the devil is on your ass to end room, target npc (invis usually off by now cause of aggro anyway) hail (can't remember if you say anything to him, been a while since I've done this) and zone out if you can on clicky stone - or die. FD classes can just fd at npc and then jump up for flag - have done this successfully with wizard, monk, bard, cleric, warrior.<br />
<br />
For farming named in Vxed most have low hp and only Chavoor seems to put out mega dps (though I havent parsed them or anything, he's just the one I die to most if shit goes wrong). There are a number of upgrades you could get and prolly for the rest of your guild also. Also a rare drop earrring off trash you could get in Barindu that would be a nice upgrade for you - ac 12, 100/100 + nice stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks all, this answers many questions -- much appreciated!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">On our server (Terris Thule) a family style guild was in Kod'Taz in March or April, so it's definitely possible to advance (think they had about 18 members).<br />
<br />
Like Inferna said, try different strategies and be creative. It will be hard for you, but should be a fun challenge.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you stand high on the wall near the zoneout stone you dont have to kill anything. When you get to the last room there have everyone invis and hug the right perimeter of the room around to the safe spot. You can also hail the npc without agro if you creep up slowly uninvis and hail at max distance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">How we do the flag is we try to clear to it.. we wipe out.. we do our CR's.. but we've killed enough mobs that the named is up.<br />
<br />
We get on our unholy steeds (or bard speed drogmor's / horses for the non-knights), run from the entry making a nice train (or have bard help ya with selo's).  Once you are there at the flag mob, you hit your Shiny Brass Idol that you farmed ahead of time.  Bingo, 18 seconds to hail the mob and have a nice chat with her about &quot;tend&quot;.  Meanwhile a HUGE train gets to bounce off you.  When you're done hailing her and talking to her about &quot;tend&quot;, click the portal stone to exit.<br />
<br />
Alternately, pull and kill all mobs at entry, then selos/horse, levitate, invis, train to quest mob, hit shiny brass idol, do the hail and so on, zone out with new flag.  Don't even have to try to clear if you farm shiny brass idols ahead o' time.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Simu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">What is the difference with using Harmshield ???<br />
<br />
Is there something I miss ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Carasak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">instant cast is the difference</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Lynxal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Klotar we are similarly geared from a HP/AC standpoint...you can tank all the trash in Vxed and get the win into Tipt....but unless the other named are substantially easier than Chavoor you can't tank the named straight up and you will have to use other class discs or an enchanter pet.<br />
<br />
Chavoor couldn't be snared so I ran around like a sissy until shammie slowed him, turned to fight...dead.<br />
<br />
As far as the con of the mob, it seemed to me it was just like Ferubi back near Rondo where a blue con kyv can still kill me with a lucky round but it's usually the yellow cons that have the good rounds and waste me even if the max hit didn't necessarily change.</div></div><hr />

Exact same experience...I know why he is called the trickster...cus he made me his bitch.</div></div><hr />
