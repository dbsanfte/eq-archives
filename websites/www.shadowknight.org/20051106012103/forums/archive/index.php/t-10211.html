<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarkQuark</div><div class="date">01-14-2003, 06:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was just wondering what kind of tatics people use against melees or casters.<br />
<br />
I love to duel (do it often but not all the time) and I usually do not lose unless someone cheats and sometimes even then I might win (IE the dingbat had ageo or something and tells me this AFTER the fight).<br />
<br />
<br />
I know for Melees (Warriors, Monks)  since we can no longer fear them I like to SS away and life tap the crap outta them.  Save HT as a kill shot.  Darkness if you can land it helps tons too but that depends on their Resis they have.  Usually after you cast it once or twice and it fails you know not to do it again.<br />
<br />
To be honest I have not dueled many casters.  Usually though I like to SS away and invis which causes them to lose me on their target. Then I can sneak up on them and DOT or HT or something.  Usually once you can get ahold of a caster you have them.  Your pet can be VERY useful here too. And if you have good MR that hurts them pretty bad.  Mages are hard cause of the pet, and Necros too but I have never dueled a Necro.  They pose a hard case since they can do a lot of what we can with good damage spells and self healing.<br />
<br />
Pallys being the anti-SK are hard having the LOH thing and healing themselves.  But the ones I have dueled I beat.  They can heal themselves but seem not to be able to do a lot of magical damage whereas we can, and heal ourselves at the same time.  I think that is what puts the balance in our favor.<br />
<br />
Just some thoughts...  What do you guys do?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tumy</div><div class="date">01-20-2003, 11:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love to talk about PvP =)  I have some xp at it, played on Rallos, but not as a SK.  Im only 53rd lvl, so everything will come from what spells I have now and such.<br />
<br />
With that out of the way, I will share what I have learned when dueling people of the same level.<br />
<br />
First, Depending on what class I fight I have different gear set up.  <br />
<br />
Pure caster - all resist gear on, MR in my oppinion is most important.  It seems that once you get your resists 150+, your pretty much set for any pure caster.<br />
<br />
Pure Melee - Strait up AC<br />
<br />
Hybrid - Here is where it becomes tough.  Again I would say the if they cant reduce your movment rate your better off.  So put all your +MR gear on and try to keep the AC up at the same time.  Again 150 seems to be the magic number.<br />
<br />
Jboots are a must!!  Or Sow potions, but Jboots prefered.<br />
<br />
Learn to straif like a rogue.<br />
<br />
Shrink, makes you harder to target.<br />
<br />
Work your hide skill.<br />
<br />
Have Pumice Stones from DE City.<br />
<br />
Max swimming skill.<br />
<br />
Make sure that you leave the 1st 2 slots open on your buff line.  Have nullify/cancel magic up.<br />
<br />
Spell line up at 53 that I prefer:<br />
 - Vs. melee's w/o Pet's, and Wiz/Dru<br />
   - Shadow Step<br />
   - Abd. of Str<br />
   - Attk. Tap<br />
   - Invis.<br />
   - Lifetap<br />
   - Spear<br />
   - Darkness<br />
   - Cancel magic<br />
<br />
 - Vs. caster w/pet<br />
   - Same but change out:<br />
   - Attk. tap out, and Fear in<br />
   - If I had another spear I would put it in          place of Str tap.<br />
<br />
SK vs. **** Class strategy:  ( Disclaimer - this is from my experiance's at 53rd level with no AA's )<br />
<br />
 - Vs. Warrior/Rogue/Monk<br />
   - Duel starts:<br />
   - sick pet<br />
   - shadow step<br />
   - try to snare ( repeat 2 times if resisted)<br />
   - If still resisted, Dot<br />
   - Get out Big damage 2hander<br />
   - Melee Kite<br />
   - shadow step/refresh Dot's/Life Tap<br />
   - When at 40%, Spear/HT.<br />
<br />
 - Vs. SK/Pally/Ranger<br />
   - Duel starts:<br />
   - Normaly peeps will try to snare/blind/stun        right away - this means RUSH them and Bash.<br />
     Once they inturupted and dazed from bash, you      snare them.<br />
   - Vs. Ranger - Melee Kite but stay very close,      dont let them use their bow.<br />
   - Vs. SK - this will normaly show who has more      mana.  Im and Ogre and dont have crap for         mana, so I pray that my MR is high enough         that they cant get me darkend.  If I get dark      to stick to them, they can have all the mana      in the world and I will pummle them to death      with my Reaver.<br />
   - Vs. Pally - LONG BATTLE - Cancel magic is         your friend, so use it to take away their hp      buffs!  You must run them out of mana in          order to kill them.  Again will show who has      the bigger mana pool.  Try to provoke them to      use their stun spells, run around.  Anyway        you can get them to use mana try it.  Try to      save your mana for when they run out.  So         when they run out of mana from stunning you.      All they are now is a under powered warrior.<br />
<br />
 -Vs. Necro/Mage/Wiz<br />
   - Spell line up for caster's/Duel starts<br />
   - Have pet targeted - Fear pet<br />
   - The caster will have casted on you, your pet      will go on caster.<br />
   - When caster roots/snares your pet - cancel        magic on pet, re-fear his pet.<br />
   - Life tap as needed - Keep his pet feared.         Your pet will do a number on him.<br />
   - Caster gets to 60%, spear, spear, HT = Dead.<br />
   - Get out your fastest weapon ( I use Shard of      Night for this) and get on top of them.    -      Vs. mage, stick with 2 hander, or try to          dispell the DS.<br />
<br />
 - Vs. Shaman/BST/Druid<br />
   - Caster line up ( for druid have melee line )<br />
   - Fear pet, pet on caster, dispell roots/snares<br />
   - With these folks you must get in their and        wack them a few times.  Your pet will not do      very well alone against them.  Most               Shaman/BST/Druids by this level have some         good AC.<br />
   - I use fast weapon here also<br />
   - Must run then out of mana to kill them.  Try      not to use life taps, they are very mana          inefficient.<br />
   - Dispell druids DS - if they are smart, they       will have burried it deep in the buff line.       This will be a pain in the ass, but well          worth the effort.  Possibly switch to 2           handed weapon<br />
   - When they get low mana, they will try running      away to hide and med - no matter what, do not      let them go if you can keep up with them,         stay on them.<br />
   - SHM/BST are very dangerous class's because of<br />
     slow.  Watch for the spell graphic's and make      sure to get a bash in there.<br />
     <br />
 - Vs. Enchanter<br />
   - Pre-Duel: Cast: Disease Cloud ON SELF!!<br />
   - Get MR as high as humanly possible<br />
   - Duel starts:<br />
   - I wouldnt use a pet, they will most likely        charm it and use it against you.<br />
   - They will have a major rune on themselves,        they will have excellent MR from self buffs.<br />
   - Pray that they are not faster than you, chase      them down.  I use 2 hander on them, drops the      rune faster.<br />
   - As soon as you start to do damage to them         spear and HT before they can re-rune.  This       may kill them, if it didnt pray that you can      break thru again.<br />
   - They normaly dont have a way to heal      themselves, so stay on them and try to break      their rune again.<br />
   - Mean while they tash ya, mez ya.  They think      they can sit and med.  Not!  Remeber that      Disease could, yeah it breaks the mez.  You       get a free full damage shot at them while         they are sitting! ( Use your 2 hander for it )<br />
   - When you break thru their rune again, spear,      and pray they dont get another rune off.<br />
   - This will be a very hard fight, no matter         what you do.<br />
   - If they use a pet, you use a pet and treat      them like a mage or necro.<br />
<br />
 - Vs. Bard<br />
   - Gah! I hate dueling bards!<br />
   - I have never won a duel with a bard.<br />
   - If they are not completely stupid, you will      not be able to beat them unless your friggen      lucky.<br />
<br />
This is what I have found to work on these class's, Im not claiming they are the best way's but they seem to work!  <br />
<br />
Some tricks to the trade:<br />
   - When dueling out side, if you need to get          away from them for some reason, try to get       to the top of a hill before you shadow step.       This will ensure that you make a good long        shadow step.<br />
   - If you are dueling a pet class, and they are       in your group.  First thing you do is cast        Invis vs. Undead on them.  This kills pet         instantly.<br />
  - When fighting outside: <br />
     - Know your opponents spells, tree's work           great for those line of sight spells.         Hills woork good also.<br />
     - Water is your friend, casters will have to        come in after you in order to hit you with        spells.<br />
     - Know your territory, have a spot picked out        in case of a retreat.  Summon pet there,          and park him, if you dont plan on using him        in he duel.  That way when you retreat you        opponent will have another thing to focus         on instead of you.<br />
<br />
These are just a few of the ideas/strategies I use when dueling 1 on 1.  For mass battle's it becomes much more complex.  I dont feel like typen all that out today, lol.  I touched on it in the &quot;I won my 10th duel today&quot; post.  Page 2, top of the page.<br />
<br />
Ok folks, hope that I didnt sound like a complete idiot, and you all learned somthing.  Take it easy.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bendark</div><div class="date">01-21-2003, 12:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A suggestion for bards- Provoke them to attack you. They will get you low and hopefully run in and attack. (Use a 1hander you need the good bash) When they come in you spear them hopefully they are low on hp then you throw your HT and hopefully bash and stun them. I have beat 2 bards with this strat so far lost to 1.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarkQuark</div><div class="date">01-22-2003, 02:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">DAMN GOOD POST TUMY!  Thanks for the detailed info!<br />
<br />
<br />
What do you do in the case of another pet class like mages?<br />
<br />
DQ</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wrend</div><div class="date">01-22-2003, 04:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a 55 Necro. And I've dueled a lot.<br />
<br />
I'm very skeptical of your plan for dueling Necros. It sounds very idealistic.<br />
<br />
Here's what I've done in the past against SK's.<br />
<br />
Never duel in a confined space. Near water is the best, with DMF up.<br />
<br />
1) The melee always tries to start the duel right up in your face. If you back up the SK will move up with you.<br />
<br />
2) Let them start the duel &quot;/d&quot;.<br />
<br />
3) When they start the duel, target the SK pet and SS away. Then while the SK is spinning around trying to find you, which they always do, hit &quot;/d&quot;, and hit the pet attack button. Then immediately target the SK and hit pet attack. Your pet now has it's marching orders for the whole fight.<br />
<br />
4) The necro pet will munch the SK pet in a very short amount of time. Then take off after the sk.<br />
<br />
5) I have 4 dots I use in duels, 1 nuke, and 1 life tap. E-Bolt (which is the devil himself if you've ever been hit with it), Splurt, Bond of Death, Dooming Darkness (fast cast), Torba's Venom (600 dd), and Drain Soul.<br />
<br />
6) I usually lead off with E-Bolt, because that messes with a person's head. It has a very nice &quot;AWWE $***&quot; factor. Then dooming darkness (iffy chance of sticking). By then the SK is running at me full speed, I then attempt another SS. If I'm far enough way, I finish the dotting. Sometimes I eat the HT, sometimes not, depending on distance. I always keep Extended Range gear on.<br />
<br />
If the SK turns his attention to my pet at all he's royally screwed. <br />
The only trouble I have is when the SK Shadow steps away. That can suck in a large zone.<br />
<br />
All this really depends on resists. Most players don't have high poison and/or disease resists.<br />
<br />
Another thing is, the only SK pet that would have any bearing on the duel would be the 64th level one. The others are simply a non issue.<br />
<br />
I don't duel as much as I used to because most players cheat. They either are 2 boxing a healer or have a retarded friend that heals them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Polite</div><div class="date">01-22-2003, 04:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. Nullify the target -- with some of the powerful long lasting buffs in the game it can often be vital to dispell.<br />
<br />
2. snare snare snare -- I chain snare melee classes non stop untill one sticks against casters i usually try around 3-4 times (if I land snare in a fight I'll win the fight).:)<br />
<br />
3. Against int casters i charge straight forward and go full offensive with 2 spears and some melee (i<br />
<br />
4. Joust melees to death and toss out nukes as they refresh -- having room to move around in is a big plus because most melees do have better dps than us in close.<br />
<br />
5. Pet classes are easy to beat once you get rid of the pet which fear spells are usefull for.<br />
<br />
6. Against bards i try to land a snares and fast dots/debuffs-- any bard worth his weight will dispell but in the time it takes him i can usually manage a few hits with my 2 hander. Bards also tend to dislike spears :)<br />
<br />
The spells I normally have memmed for pvp<br />
<br />
 1.Engulphing darkness<br />
 2.Spear of plague<br />
 3.Spear of pain<br />
 4.Spirit tap or sometimes lifeleach for faster dmg<br />
 5.Harmshield (once used i mem shadow step in its place) hotkeyd<br />
 6.Abduction of strength (used for burying snares)<br />
 7.Nullify magic<br />
 8.Invoke fear</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Soulle</div><div class="date">01-23-2003, 12:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Harmsheild as soon as I see 3 or more opponents, but not more than 5... thats too many.  I play on a pvp server.<br />
<br />
/chuckle <br />
<br />
Target anyone in a robe, wizzy's are priority because of manaburn.<br />
<br />
Walk right on top of them, click off the harmshield buff and use my UT3 Harmtouch of instant death to corpse them right away.<br />
<br />
Turn from the smoking corpse and target the next most dangerous person, prioritys go robes, then clerics, then everybody else using hps as a priority maker... the more they have, the lower they are on the totem pole.<br />
<br />
Use these spells in this order.<br />
-Ignite Blood<br />
-Blood of Hate<br />
-Spear of Pestilence<br />
-Spear of Plague<br />
-Touch of Volatalis<br />
<br />
Close and attempt to joust them as much as possible while recasting any of those spells as soon as they refresh or in the case of the dots wear off.  <br />
<br />
When they start running in a panic, hop on horse, run ahead of them... use /dismount key to instantly put yourself at a stop, nuke and repeat untill they somehow get away or die.<br />
<br />
Find the next person in line and repeat the above steps.<br />
<br />
If you find yourself dangerously low on life, run away.  :)<br />
<br />
Once everyone you've met before, and even some that you haven't instantly leave the zone as soon as you arrive, or run screaming into the hills as soon as they see you... you know you're making Pappa Cazik happy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tumy</div><div class="date">01-23-2003, 02:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wrend, your strategy sounds like it would work up until the part where your pet munched my pet...<br />
<br />
Before duel have necro pet targeted.<br />
<br />
Duel begins, you SS.  <br />
<br />
I cast fear, your pet runs away.  <br />
<br />
Most people will have already started to cast on the SK by that point, so where does my pet go?  <br />
<br />
On you.<br />
<br />
This could turn out to be a very long fight, or a very short one.  <br />
<br />
But the first thing to do with any pet class is to take the pet away.<br />
<br />
Once you get on top of the necro, he/she will try to SS away.<br />
<br />
Watch for the necro to SS, this is a very fast casting spell, but you can interrupt it with quick reflexes.  If you can stop them from SSing away its a good chance that you can end it right there.<br />
<br />
If you need to end it fast,and you know you cant get close enough for a bash to interuppt the SS. ( Only when the caster is down to 60% or less) HT, and if your lucky he wont go very far, immediatly Spear, Spear.  That should end it for sure.  <br />
<br />
( Only if your desperate to end the battle fast, very risky and may end up bad.  This is the last ditch effort )<br />
<br />
If he manages to SS out of range, hope that you can catch him.  If you know you cant, run away and come back later.  (if your outside)  <br />
<br />
If your in a arena, get after him, never let him get a second to cast.<br />
<br />
Mage = easier than necro because no heal or SS.<br />
<br />
As long as you can keep your movement rate up, and you stay on top of the mage, you should win. <br />
<br />
Mage DS is nasty, use a 2 hander.<br />
<br />
Of course turn attacks off after you have made a swing.  So that you can nail him the next time he stops to cast.<br />
<br />
If your a large race or have the AA's for 2h bash, for god sake use it everytime they stop to cast.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have a 51st necro, and like I said before in the origonal post.  He would be very hard to beat, but I think in the end with my resists I would end up beating him.<br />
<br />
I once dueled a 61st level Bst lord.  I couldnt figure out why I couldnt fear his pet, until he told me about the ability to make pets immune to fear.  I got owned hard core.  So for all you that are dueling peeps with that ability, beware!<br />
<br />
Next time we met, I loaded up my SV. Disease and poison, and snared his pet and kited till I could fear the pet.<br />
<br />
After he was feared, I knew I couldnt snare the Bst because of the LvL diff. so I did my best to joust and spear.  But in the end he got me, and I only got him to 50% health.<br />
<br />
Was a great experiance, and humbling one at that.  At that point I hadent lost a 1 on 1 duel, ever.... ( because I dont duel bards, learned the hard way with my monk! lol )<br />
<br />
Suggestions for Resist priority vs. ##### class:<br />
<br />

<br />
Vs. Sk<br />
1. MR ( darkness line )<br />
2. Fire ( ignite blood line )<br />
<br />
Vs. Ranger<br />

2. Fire ( DD's )<br />
<br />
Vs. Wiz<br />

3. Fire<br />
<br />
Vs. Necro<br />
1. MR ( darkness )<br />
2. Poison ( venom series )<br />
3. Fire ( Blood series, DD's )<br />

<br />
Vs. Rogue<br />
1. MR ( Snare, blind )<br />
2. Poison ( Duh )<br />
<br />
Vs. Enchanter<br />
1. MR, lolololol  &quot;This is gunna suck&quot;<br />
<br />
Vs. Bard<br />
1. MR ( snare )<br />
<br />
Vs. Bst<br />
1. I forget their spell line up.  Would do Disease because I dont like being slowed.<br />
<br />
<br />
That would be my choice as far as resist's 1 on 1.<br />
I may be wrong, feel free to let me know.<br />

Edit: Im still not sure about the Rogue movment/atk slow, may be disease based.  Thanks to Meriboh for the info on the Dru/Rng Dot's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meriboh</div><div class="date">01-24-2003, 12:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some nice tips here =)<br />
<br />
I just wanted to clarify Tumy’s resist check for Druids and Rangers; thier DoT’s are magic based, not disease.<br />
Make sure to always have your MR up past 150 at the very least.<br />
I have two sets of equipment on me at all times. When I go out to PK, I put my MR gear on. With a Shaman or Cleric’s MR buff (+40 MR) and a Shaman Null Aura potion (+15 MR), I have 220 MR.<br />
Even then, It’s not guaranteed that you will resist a root or snare. I have, however, resisted Winged Death several times, which really makes the Druids angry =P<br />
<br />
Dispell is your friend and your enemy. When facing Druids, Rangers and other classes that depend heavily on thier buffs, I always lead off with Dispell magic or use pumice. Dispelling a Druids, SoW, MR buff and levitate usually results in the gating real quick. Ranger’s damage shield, SoW, STR buffs etc. are what makes them so formidable.<br />
SS and dispell a few times before engaging in combat.<br />
<br />
Melee classes:<br />
<br />
Jousting is a must, regardless of the level of your opponent. The less damage you take, the less chance of you getting killed by reinforcements that may have just arrived. Jousting allows you to see what’s coming or what’s waiting in the shadows for you. Force your opponent (if they are a melee class) to have to move around. I usually run past them and quickly turn around and bash. Then strafe around them so thier back is still facing me, then turn auto attack on. This will usually confuse them as they try to figure out where you are. If they do eventually face you, walk backwards then lunge at them again and repeat. A good 2H will work wonders when this tactic works. The other advantage of being behind them, is that they cannot disarm, reposte or parry.<br />
If at the beginning of the fight, you dipelled any see invis buff they may have had up, use “hide” when you lunge past them to remove yourself from thier target. They will then have to retarget, which can be a pain if you are constantly moving and hiding.<br />
Save mana and only use DoTs, Taps or Spear line when needed to end the fight or when they begin to flee.<br />
I NEVER use HT unless they are very close to a zone and begin to run when low on HP. Save it for the difficult fights.<br />
<br />
Caster classes<br />
<br />
They can be deadly or easy depending on level difference and tactics.<br />
Most will strafe or walk backwards forcing you move with them. With  that darn melee bug which makes it almost impossible to land any melee damage because of the “You are too far away” or “You cannot see your target” bug. This is where your DoTs, Taps and spear line come into play. Keep close to them and unleash quick casting spells on them. With casters, it’s not the 200+ 2HS that will win the fights, but that quick 1HS and bash that will...most of the time. I have beaten red con Druids using a Lamentation and a shield. It is so fast, that they will have a hard time channeling a spell through. Never let them stop and begin to cast a spell. A HT at the beginning of the fight will usually make them think twice about fighting or make them gate. I wouldn’t advise this, as then if they return, after being healed by thier pocket Cleric, you will have lost your coupe de gras to end the fight in most situations.<br />
Disease cloud cast on yourself and poison potions work wonders when facing an Enchanter. If they Tash you, quickly use your poison potion to dispell it. Disease cloud will prevent you from being mezed for more than a tic.<br />
Fearing pets and staying close to the caster with a fast weapon is usually key to a successful fight.<br />

Now, I’m no expert Pker, the above info is just from my experience. I have died many, many, many times, but have learned a little more with each defeat. Visiting other classes web sites and learning about those classes, will make you a more educated dueler/pker. Just remember, there is always a bigger, more experienced bully than you out there =P<br />
