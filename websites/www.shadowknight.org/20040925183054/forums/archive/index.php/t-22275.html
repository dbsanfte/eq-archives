<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Slithinknott</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I got some good advice here before beside Run 4 Run 5 what should i be doing next magelo here with a list of aa. http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=481057</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Spell Casting Expertise I for 2 aa points is a good investment, so you never fizzle CD again.<br />
<br />
IF you don't expect your gear to get much better in the next little while (I suspect yours will), then I'd suggest sta and adv sta.  15 aa would get you 30 more sta, one aug or so away from 305 sta cap.  Then sta buffs become one of those things you can click off.  If you expect good gear improvements, then this wouldn't be a good choice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rhumba_Kween</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If I were you:<br />
<br />
1) Get level one of Spell casting Expertise, if you use Fear or Clinging Darkness for aggro. No more fizzles on those is very nice and cheap. No real need to go past level 1 though<br />
2) Weapon Affinity is real nice, and although it hurts self procs. It does not hurt them badly, and certainly makes up for it in increased weapon proc rate. This one gets too much of a bad wrap, although, I still would not reccommend it till well past 300 AA's.<br />
3) After that is done, and you do Swift Journey, I would start on the Leech Touch line. I'm working on it now, and although I use it seldom, it has bailed me out occasionally. Super over priced for what you get, but still it is useful occasionally. I'd put it in that 400 aa range.<br />
<br />
Other than that you are at the same point I am. I think you have Pet Crits (which seems worthless to me for the cost), and a couple level of Damage shields (which I may get after I finish up the leech touches).<br />
<br />
Good luck,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Menon Lifeblight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Run 5 then bank for OOW.  Resists if you get more than 30 banked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Slithinknott</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">any double riposter supporters why is double riposte bad is that so i wont get a mob down to the summoning point when i am offtanking mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I don't think double riposte is bad just doesn't have much value.  You don't riposte that often with our level of skill and you only double riposte half the time so from a dps standpoint its tiny.<br />
<br />
It has never been an issue for me when mez tanking and I don't even remove my weapons.<br />
<br />
Now if we got a riposte disk would be nice to have.</div></div><hr />
