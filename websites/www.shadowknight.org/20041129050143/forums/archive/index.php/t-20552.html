<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Maniacles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The trouble with life taps is, whenever &quot;equivalence&quot; is attempted by the developers, it seems that something that does x damage is equivalent to something that does x/2 damage and liftaps for x/2.<br />
<br />
Healing and damage output are not one to one conversions.  They are apples and oranges.<br />
<br />
The value of a point of healing factors in a)average mob damage and b)average pc hp.<br />
<br />
The value of a point of damage factors in a)hp of the mob being faught, and b)average damage being done in other methods by the pc.<br />
<br />
So there's no reason to link the recourse tap of a lifetap to the damage inflicted.  I'd like to see spells which did a lot of damage and a little lifetap, as well as little damage and lots of lifetap.  This 50/50 crap has gotten stale.<br />
<br />
<br />
Alternatively, we COULD make them one to one conversions via coding: &quot;any lifetap healing which brings the lifetapper over max hp is instead inflicted on the target as damage.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Lifetaps should be worth 2/3 the value of a dd, a 1200 nuke equilavent to a 800 lifetap on a point for point basis.  The problem with this however is thats what Necromancers will get so our tap values get diluted twice, first to scale the lifetap appropriatley then to scale it to a hybrid class, its like Ranger heals</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Another problem with our taps is their relative diminished value.<br />
<br />
We are still using spells designed to be effective on mobs from four expansions ago. Tanking in Kod'Taz and beyond they have greatly diminished effectiveness; even if you can channel one, the impact is small. Most other classes have gotten a healing upgrade since pop was released, it would have been nice to see a faster casting Ancient life tap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>aress</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">word.<br />
Taps are nice to slowly heal up after the mob is dead, basically, a nice regen spell.  They cannot be considered worthy battle heals.<br />
<br />
I am sick of the &quot;parent class&quot; phrasing.  This is such a thing of the past.  Many philosophies have drastically changed in the last 4 years, why cling to the parent class issues?<br />
<br />
75% warrior?  worthless tank<br />
50% necro?  With spells approx. 10 levels lower than necros have at 65 (philosophically)?  Not much damage.<br />
<br />
SOE should finally start the Knight balancing.  Casters have been balanced/upgraded first (no benefit to us).  Then the pure melee were balanced against the casters.  We did not get attention.<br />
<br />
What is wrong in increasing our dps?  Our tankability?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Our balance was done before casters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>aress</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">keyboard glitch, double post</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>aress</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">does this mean we are next in line again? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Seems to me that we got a reputation as being over powered in PoP and we are now paying for this<br />
<br />
Of course it was the Pallys more then us, but hey they link us so we are getting dragged down with them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Lejina Bloodbath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Our balance was done before casters.<br />
<br />
Uh, no.<br />
<br />
Do not confuse the 2hander revamp.<br />
<br />
This effected warriors, monks, rangers, paladins and shadowknights.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Do not confuse the addition of the Voice and Terror lines with a revamp either.<br />
<br />
They were a poor attempt at fixing the nerf on Disease Cloud. Our agro generation (sustained and snap) has been destroyed at this period.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Addition of the recourses coponents?<br />
<br />
Destruction of the agro power of our AC taps, several of our good PvP spells made unusuable and some other spells can now be problematic to use since the recourse will overwrite a buff if you have 15 buffs already.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The release of PoP?<br />
<br />
Hum, nope. Lvl increased for all classes. Granted that was a good period for us, but nothing has been done to our class in a long termthinking, GoD putting us unable to do our role in single group encounters show this.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
That dream you got about the SK class being revamped?<br />
<br />
Yeah, Good Times.<br />
<br />
Lets stick to reality tho, k?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hybrid rebalance was done back in Kunark/Velious Lejina, 2h changes, removal of exp penality, increase of mana pools, removal of an additional mana penality on lifetaps, being thought of as hybrids with nothing really unique, innate casting haste, increase of defense skill, I'm sure I'm forgetting a couple other things to.  Just pointing out that we had ours awhile ago but thats outdated so yes we are due for another rebalance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Oh, since I'm in such a good mood... Lifetaps need rebalanced.<br />
<br />
Using the top two heals plus dot heal (bod/cleansing) fully focused/aa'ed for both:<br />
SK:  106.6 dmg/sec 116.25 heal/sec, 222.85 hp swing/sec<br />
Pal: 571.46 heal/sec</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Lejina Bloodbath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hahahah<br />
<br />
Holy shit, i wasnt expecting you to pull out the history books of the last millenary.<br />
<br />
If you pick up the other book at the left, you will see the Old World one.<br />
<br />
Man, we used to tank the uber mobs back then.<br />
<br />
&quot;Surrender now Ser Nagafen, or as true as i hold this blessed Yak and this trusty Bladestopper, i (and my 20 pals) shall kill ye.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ole ole times.</div></div><hr />
