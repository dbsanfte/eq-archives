If you hail the mob at the end and say &quot;tend&quot; does this flag you or do you actually have to click the stone to port out for the flag to be complete?  I finished VXed yesterday and was trained before I could click the stone.  I got my rez outside.  Any help would be apreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Daerkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">When I first completed Vxed I simply ported out after talking to the end npc. I know at that time it was sufficient as I did Tipt the following day and then zoned into KT. However that was when the expansion was first released (haven't been quite as motivated for GoD since!), so maybe someone who has done the flagging procedure recently should confirm this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Visvires</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Im pretty sure just the dialogue is sufficient</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Flanders</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The problem is, when I talk to Urdana she gives me the same &quot;Take Heed&quot; dialog as she did before I completed VXed.  I tell her &quot;Take Heed&quot; and nothing happens.  Of course at the time I wasnt grouped so maybe nothing was supposed to happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Elkar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Wow, exact same thing has happened to me.  I no longer get text from the NPC.  Looking for an answer on this from GM's is about worthless, seeing as CS now seems to be fully migrated to dumbfucks in India (check the Engrish):<br />

Any more information here would be appreciated, since it's obviously not available from Sony.</div></div><hr />

General consensus is you DONT have to click the stone for the flag to complete (unlike HoH flag after AD).  The script is still majorly bugged.  Some people claim hailing the NPC in a certain order and saying &quot;issues&quot; to the apprentice at the right time fixes it.  Also if you tell the apprentice &quot;take heed&quot; and nothing happens, this is a good sign.  It means you have the flag and you are simply getting the wrong dialog from the NPC.  <br />

Let me know if you find out anything more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">That's awesome that he told you to talk to the Seer in Knowledge.  Wish I could help with your problem on the flags, but at least I'm willing to admit I have no idea if you're screwed or not. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Feriin Cydovu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hey Elkar ,<br />
<br />
Nice UI can you give a link of where I could download it from?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>RoshenWampa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If you get the &quot;you have recieved a checklist flag&quot; message, you should be flagged for completing Vxed.<br />
<br />
As for the mob outside to start Tipt... just say 'Tipt'.  It should start the trial for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Flanders</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">checked the log and I didnt recieve that message.<br />
<br />
I did receive a yellow message that stated (paraphrase) &quot;You feel at one with the basalisk stone&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Flanders</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Also iirc I didnt recieve that message either when I hailed the Smith Rondo ghost<br />
<br />
As for the mob outside to start Tipt... just say 'Tipt'. It should start the trial for you.<br />
Also thats what you say when you want to start the xp version of Tipt after you have completed the flagging version</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If &quot;take heed&quot; no longer works to give you a vxed expedition and it did before ... you got the flag.  Saying &quot;tipt&quot; starts the next expedition.  Saying &quot;vxed&quot; after getting flag, will give you an exp version of vxed.  &quot;take heed&quot; wont work anymore, after getting the flag.<br />
<br />
After getting temp flag, saying &quot;issues&quot; to scribe, converts it into a permanent flag.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>AoWtho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Mardark is correct.  There is no xp version of Tipt, really.  Tipt just has the triggered named and Jhiru at the end.  You always get the same zone with Tipt, where Jhiru and the triggers are always available, and the only way to instance it is to say &quot;Tipt&quot; to Apprentice Udranda.  You do NOT have to click the stone in Vxed to get the flag.  I ran up to the end and hailed to get my flag.. then trained everything out of the way while my group went in and hailed.. I died and was later rezzed outside, and my flags work fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Elkar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Thanks.  After 7 days and no response to the new CS ticket system, sk.org to the rescue.<br />
<br />
Edit:  The UI is Cairenn a featured at  EQInterface (http://www.eqinterface.com/downloads/fileinfo.php?id=971) here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Flanders</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Yes I see the error in my saying that was the xp version.  And after long confusing discussions with several people I have come to realize <br />
<br />
1.  I have the flag<br />
2.  The NPCs have NO dialog implemented that ushers you into tipt after completing Vxed.  It mearly stays the same.<br />
<br />
Thanks Sony.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sarrasis Darkmist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Sorry for the bump but I had a question about the same thing.  The other day I was able to run to the NPC and Hail after my group had wiped.  I didnt say anything...just hailed.  Is that was enough for the flag?  When I go to the Apprentice I am able to get a Tipt expedition.  Did the flag stick or are you able to start Tipt without having Vxed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Well yeah they really need to implement some kinda seer for GoD it seems.<br />
<br />
-Bolas</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Askeer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">there's like 5 flags for the entire expansion, and they're pretty linear...a seer isnt needed really.</div></div><hr />
