<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dravok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After 40 hours of camping that bird, 10 of which was from waiting in line to be the next one to camp him, I finally skewered that Kentucky Fried Chicken reject.  All I have to say that it is the WORST camp ever.  After this ordeal, I have lost a little bit of sanity that I will never get back.  Now if you will excuse me, I got to catch up on some sleep.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valkyria Grymreaper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I did him about a month ago. 33 hour camp.<br />
<br />
You are correct. Anyone that does this camp is never really the same after...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Puurrdy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The best part is waiting for someone else that's been there for the last 30+ hours, they finally log out of sheer boredom/frustration and 10 minutes later the bird pops up right on top of you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sithanator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I did the damn bird about 2 weeks ago. Mostly just spent time while i wasn't camping him. Was kinda funny how it went down when I got him. 2 others were there at the camp AFK most of the time, rogue came back we start talking, SF popped. Roge managed to tag him first. I bite my tongue and didn't HT until SF was under 50%. Turned out Rogue was helping his monk friend and he all ready had the eye patch. waited 6 and half minutes friend didn't get back, so he let me loot. <br />
Later<br />
Sith</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fallows</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">When I zoned in a low level druid was kiting SF and I asked if I could loot he said sure... saved me a lot of hassle :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Vigormortis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I got there early one day and waited. Someone already had camp, so I just FD'd and waited, hoping they would give up their camp. they didnt, 20 some odd hours later, SF popped and I helped take him down, he looted, wished me GL, and left. I Waited around for next spawn, he skipped, of course, then waited for next. He spawned right on time, only to be snagged by a fekkin group of about 9 people. Said they were camping lodi, but sure enough a fekkin druid snagged him and they raped him. So after much cursing and yelling and calling them every name in the book.. which did no good.. they just said &quot;stfu whiner&quot; and left. I waited till next spawn. Skip and next spawn. I got up to get a bowl of cereal, and my Gf said &quot;theres a big flying thing on your screen&quot; and I scrambled back to my keyboard. killed him quick. <br />
No sleep for many many days<br />
I left part of my brain in that camp, if anyone finds it, let me know.<br />
That camp changes people... turns them into zombies.<br />
they should call him Satanfeather<br />
But I'm a pirate now, YARG!!!<br />
<br />
P.S: why cant you just kill the damn gnome and take it???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ophidius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ive done Stormy twice and its almost timed to get a third patch =x</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Floppy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">P.S: why cant you just kill the damn gnome and take it???<br />
<br />
Because then there would perpetually be 15 groups in Iceclad camping the gnome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shainaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">2 hour camp.  :D   zoned in, saw no one thought hell, may as well see what happens.  2 hours later chicken strips for dinner and a new clicky play with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Utmost</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I went to SF spawn point and turned up volume to max.  As i was surfin windows I heard some loud flapping.  Patch was mine)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Zenobie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hey Utmost, guess who's camping him atm ? :D My third attempt...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Utmost</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Dang, GL)  and when your done can I get one of those gnome legs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Zenobie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Wooo Stormfeather down ! Definitvely 32hrs+-2. <br />
<br />
And bhooo to Oragan, 65 anon SK of Saryrn who KSed Apexi, another SK. SF popped on Apexi's head, agroed him, and Oragan HTed it to death. Oh, and I was camping the place for 30hrs, but nobody cares, nobody repects that camp.<br />
<br />
EDIT : A leg or a Wing ? :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Vezax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">This camp does chnage you in a bad way.  I never want to go to ICeclad ever again.  Camped him for 29 29 hour but i couldnt take it anymore and went to bed.  Woke up 6 hr later and I see him attacking me. Now i tell everybody I see never do this camp it really does screw you up.<br />
<br />
PS I forgot, why was it always ranger being sneaky and dick-like when camping this.  It got really old after see ing 3 anon invis hunters(rangers) who i send tells to not respond who creep around my camp?  I mean everybody else would make conversation and maybe wait for you to tired out and take over?  Ahhh well the best way to make KSers go away is &quot;i can get get him to less then 50% life in less then a sec, hope you have head shot and get a lucky crit&quot;(note threat was only used on rangers=P)<br />
<br />
Dont do this quest, It really isnt worth it unless you amazingly luck into SF.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Pots The Gnome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Couldnt really think of a better place to post this... <br />
<br />
What level do you need for the turnins? all the mobs are pretty low level except lodi so was wondering if I could actually go ahead and do the quest in the 40s-low50s  granted that lodi is killed for me by someone else :D</div></div><hr />
