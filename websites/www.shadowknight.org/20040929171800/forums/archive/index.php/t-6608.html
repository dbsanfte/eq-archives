<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Khirsah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Am I wasting my time creating an Iksar SK? I got him to 10 over the last 2 days but since we cant wear plate I cant wear the best SK armor, will I not be able to survive in 50-65 range later on? Is there enough buffs and magical items to compensate? Please help me out, since I deleted my 23 DE SK to create this lizard, and now I'm worrying it was a mistake! Thanks in advance<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>zukanazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Iksar can absolutely wear the best sk armor avilable. You cannot wear many types such as Blood Ember but near the endgame you wouldn't be wearing it anyway. Granted, it's a big pain to miss out on some of the things available to other races as you level such as sentient or moktor but once you start getting into ToV it won't matter. The only exception I would include, however, are the newer racial armors if you have the ability to get access to them without too much trouble. Depending on your gear it could be very nice to wear a 50+ac breastplate or 25+ac bracer if you aren't quite ready for ToV.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyway, profanity aside, Iksar are just fine as SKs... or warriors, monks, shaman and necro for that matter. You can wear all of the high end stuff. Ive always felt like we have to be creative than other SKs races in our armor choices. <br />
<br />
In fact, it was my old Rygor BP that I still had at 53 that allowed me to loot a 30AC bp from DN on a guild raid (see my magelo profile).<br />
<br />
you do miss out on some good 40ish level armor but youll get over it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Khirsah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks man - REALLY appreciate it! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tsaryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It's really not that bad.  I used to think the same thing.. I hang out with folks that don't raid the high end - so I'm not able to loot the all race high AC sk items.. but I get by - and there's a lot of GOOD tradable stuff (see blood runed gaunts and greaves and the umberbulk shield) to that's iksar friendly.. and I wouldn't trade being a lizard for anything.</div></div><hr />

There's a thread that should help you decide.  Despite the title, you should find ample reason to want to continue to level your Iksar SK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Niftystuff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It's rough out there but I guess I do alright for myself:p .<br />
<br />
Iksars are just as good as anyone else, the no plate thing doesn't apply to most armor, just stuff like blood ember and a few other things that you can do without.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rubicaant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">the iksar no plate thing mainly applies to kunark and old world.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Daikoku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">And Umbral Plains.<br />
<br />
Their are ways around, though it will be rough mid 40's  to lower 50's if you can't raid fear.  <br />
<br />
Plate house is the answer to Kunark Armor.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Lunaticfringesk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The drawback of not being able to wear plate armor is probably not that huge of an issue at all.  IKS not being able to wear plate armor is at least partially offset by the natural AC bonus that they get.  At 60, this ac bonus varies when you compare it race to race, but seems to always be in excess of 50 more ac.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, Dreadscale and even Ry'Gorr armor is easily useable to mid to late 40s and by that time you will be ready to start your Thurg armor quests in Kael.  Another option, if you loathe killing in Kael, once you hit 45, is to go to PoG for armor drops.  PoG armor is essentially the equivalent of Thurg armor.<br />
<br />
From Thurg / PoG armor, you can graduate to SS or Kael armor quests (depending on your faction) if you can get into a guild that somewhat raids ToV on a fairly regular basis.<br />
<br />
All of these armor drops are wearable by IKS and all are very good armor.<br />
<br />
It isnt easy to get armor pieces better than Kael / SS armor.  To get better, you are most likely killing upper-end raid mobs and will probably need to be in a good guild to do so.  Guildless people will have an extremely tough time getting armor better than SS / Kael (hell, even those generally require several groups of high level characters to get).<br />
<br />
If you are able to get into a very powerful guild (NToV and beyond), then most, if not substantially all, of the armor drops are wearable by IKS, which means, by extension, you will end up with a higher ac than most other SKs due to the ac bonus.  This will be argued by many, however, as not being that huge an advantage due to the ac softcap (which you'll pretty easily hit once in full SS / Kael armor anyways, to say nothing of the armor obtainable that is better than that).<br />
<br />
At the end of the day, dont sweat it at all.  The drawback is mitigated.  Some even argue that IKS are too strong due to their ac bonus.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Skek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Aye Ikkys are just fine as knights.  They have a very balanced set of stats which is great at high level for making the most of buffs.<br />
<br />
Click on my tag below to see some of the stuff you can get a hold of later on if your guild raids a bit.  As you can see the no plate so called penalty is a pure myth.<br />
<br />
Sure there's a hump from 40 to 50 where you'll be stuck with seb scale or something, but in cases like that... get a warrior to tank in the group rather than you.<br />
<br />
Oh... and sink every stat point you have in to Sta.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Manslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The only blood ember item that you really will miss is the legs.  Mana free FD without the week long refresh is good.  Gaunts with the snare effect are decent as well, but you will get by fine without them.<br />
<br />
As a side note, Iksar shammy can't use JBB which is pretty significant.  At least until you can get that Spear thingy from Luclin.</div></div><hr />
