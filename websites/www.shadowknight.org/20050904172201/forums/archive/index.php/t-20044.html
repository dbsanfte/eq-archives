I know that ikky illusion potions are supposed to work, but i don't really wanna have to shell out that kind of plat for just one stupid mob. Any help would be appreciated, thx :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dajmin</div><div class="date">02-15-2004, 10:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only way I found to raise the necro faction (Brood of Kotiz) is to kill the Iksar outcasts in Warslik's Wood and LoIO.  Neither the bone chip quest nor the explorer knives raise it.<br />
<br />
Here's the easiest way to do it:-<br />
1. Buy a couple of mage summoned pet toys.  I favour the muzzle and belt.  For me weapons were optional since my lvl 55 pet is still not high enough to proc any of the good mage summons.<br />
<br />
2. Head to WW from OT and follow the path to the ruined hut on your left hand side.  There are 3 Iksar Outcast spawns in there, and unlike most of the spawns in the caves to the south, these ones all attack even when green.<br />
<br />
3. Cast a pet and position yourself in the middle of the three.  This works best if you have a mount, since that stops you getting knocked backward.  Bring lots of food so you continue to regen health, cause your mount will steal it all!<br />
<br />
4. Go AFK.  Go to work, sleep or whatever, this can take some time.<br />
<br />
5. While you're gone, the outcasts will attack you and your pet will kill them.   You will also get agro from any passing giants of goblins, and this is where the summoned gear comes in.<br />
If you have a pet getting a kicking from several mobs, he is likely to die.  The extra hitpoints and haste from the friendly mages will ensure he kills them before they do him (and then you!).<br />
<br />
6. When you come back, you'll find a pile of corpses and a better standing with the Brood of Kotiz.  Easy, hassle-free and less time consuming than running around killing them yourself when you could be doing something else.<br />
<br />
Incidentally, dubious is good enough standing with Residents to do the Frontier Mountains hand-in and apprehensive is good enough to do the History of Greenmist tome turn-in for the final part.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps :)</div></div><hr />

This could garner you a warning on your account if you're caught.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Groff Gorespiller</div><div class="date">02-16-2004, 09:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When was the last time you saw anyone in Warsliks, let alone a GM/Guide?<br />
<br />
If you're really seriously worried about getting a warning, you can also go to the hut in the south west, by the lakes.  Not all of them will attack every time, but some of them will, so you should be able to get a little faction work done while you're afk.<br />
<br />
I found that three good nights of parking there at the first hut from OT zone was enough to bring me to well over apprehensive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Naelyan</div><div class="date">02-16-2004, 04:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">alright, thanks so much! i really appreciate it! :) i've found the huts in WW that you're all talking about, never thought of parking myself there though... and i'm lvl 65 with the lvl 64 pet, i've tried, he can take a good 4 or 5 of them at once before they start to touch his hp, hehe. thanks much, happy hunting to you all! :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
And no, I didn't particularly worry about it, as I said, I did it too.  But it's just something to be aware of in a risk vs. reward kinda thing.  <br />
<br />
Never thought of using the mount to offset the knockback, btw.  There were a couple mornings where I'd find I'd been knocked out of range.  Good thinking!</div></div><hr />
