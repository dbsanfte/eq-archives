<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Makkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I can't seem to find a definitive answer, here or on other sites. Against the Emperor in SSRA, does greenmist turn into a 24/22 or a 6/22? I don't have a lot of experience with the way bane weapons work.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I always thought bane dmg worked like the dmg Bonus. Where it doesnt add to the Ratio of the weapon but adds to the Actual damage output on each hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Makkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Interesting, I sort of got that impression from a post I was reading about bane weapons with him. Basically it went that 2h weapons were better against him because of the damage bonus, given his crazy AC.<br />
<br />
Guess it'd be easier to get GM than wait in the list of melees for a bane weapon. I generally get asked to play my necro in raids anyway, unfortunately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">From what a lot of folks have said, they usually don't get to use GM on the Emp anyway.  It generates too much aggro, and they usually aren't tanking Emp.  <br />
<br />
I've heard it positively eats through the non-mezzable guards in Emp room that SKs end up Off Tanking though.<br />
<br />
/shrug<br />
<br />
One way to find out. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Newark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">24/22 against the Emperor.  This is better than most of the SSRA bane weapons you can make (IMO).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Skoriksis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I can also confirm that it's 24/22 against the Emporer, and I used it every time we killed him.<br />
<br />
I also never once got aggro. If your main tank is good at keeping aggro and you pay attention, you'll be fine.<br />
<br />
Besides, when I killed Emp, I never once got aggro. Went full out melee with Greenmist and was chain casting 3 spears on our last kill and still didn't get aggro.<br />
<br />
But if you get aggro, change you tactics immediately. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Harjon Baradda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It's a 24/22 against emp and other Shissars. If it was a 6/22 there would be NO WAY I could score 150+ damage hits.<br />
<br />
<br />
Greenmist in SSRA in general<br />
The proc is resisted against undead Shissars.<br />
I forged the 1hs Corrupted Knight's Sword and swap either out depending on what we are fighting on the raid.<br />
<br />
Greenmist <br />
Damage: 18<br />
Delay: 22 <br />
Ratio: 1.222 Amazing <br />
AC: +5 Str: +5 Dex: +5 Int: +10 Magic Resist: +25 Poison Resist: +5 Disease Resist: +10  <br />
Bane DMG: Shissar: +6<br />
This is a 24/22 against Shissar.<br />
<br />
Corrupted Shissar Knight's Sword <br />
Damage: 10<br />
Delay: 22 <br />
Ratio: 2.2 Excellent <br />
AC: +10 Str: +15 Sta: +15 Agi: +8 Dex: +5 Wis: +15 Int: +15 Cha: +5 Magic Resist: +10 Fire Resist: +10 Cold Resist: +10 Poison Resist: +10 HP: +80 Mana: +60  <br />
Bane DMG: Shissar: +12<br />
This is a 22/22 against Shissar.<br />
<br />
Both are great, but if the proc is going to get resisted against undead Shissar, then I prefer the extra stats on the Corrputed.</div></div><hr />
