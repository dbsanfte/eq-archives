<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ruuti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just  a totally random thought but most people SK or any class for that matter, get their epic and mabye use it for a level or two then perma stash it in the bank and move on to the next (relatively  cheap )  upgrade.  These are for the people who actually put the time in to get these awesome looking cake cutters.  Kinda makes me feel a little like the makers of EQ shot their load a little prematurely with the Epics,  as I would kinda think that something that is Epic,  would remain the quintessential weapon of the class.  <br />
        <br />
       SOE has proven that they can make scaleable items,  with the charms and now augments that grow with the completion of certain criteria,  why not make an epic only augment.  That increases the power of the Epic as the holder meets certain goals.  For instance as the owner completes levels or planar progresssion.  Or add new stops in the Epic quests that will allow you to flag a new power progression for your Epic.  <br />
Another idea that might be worth looking into is to make an entire epic AA classification that would allow people to use AA to buy and increase the damage output or stats on a given epic.  How bout everyone has their Epic but the stats and abilities on everyones is different? <br />
<br />
Just some random blathering,  feel free to tell me what you think</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xegonick Soulstryfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Flame me if you must but i think an idea like that would be great if the devs were to implement it properly.Of course this is coming from someone who has yet to actually get the curse himself.(Damn drakes)only thing i need is that friggin hide.Balanced my ballz.Been on many many runs thru hate,killed many drakes,seen pieces for other classes epics numerous times...and still no hide of course.But i'm getting off on a rant.I think if a system like this to improve your epic were introduced it would help knock the dust off of all the epics laying in bank slots as we speak.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>cmdrbean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That's a REALLY good idea. I wish I had thought of it. &gt;:P<br />
<br />
They could make it to where once you get the item there are maybe different trials or quests you can do to add stats or effects to the item, so it's totally dynamic. For instance, you could complete one quest that gives it a different proc, or reduces the delay, or adds bane dmg of a certain type. The best thing they could do I think would be to make it totally non-linear, meaning that it's not just an epic progression, but rather at any given point you can do one of a number of subquests. The reward will be directly based off of the difficulty.<br />
<br />
I think that would be basically the best possible use of both the Charms code from LoY, and the Augments code from LDoN.<br />
<br />
Another way to look at it would be... perhaps have it gain in power (better ratio, added bane/elemental dmg, maybe particle effects upgrades at certain points) based on lvls/skills/aa/stats/keys owned/zone flags, or some combination thereof... and then have the quests there as a way to add, change, or upgrade focus effects, procs, things of that nature.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xegonick Soulstryfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hails all,<br />
   I'm getting ready to do my final turn in and do the lhranc fight.Quick question,was reading thru some various walk thrus and was told i could skip a few parts(cough elixer,tome)so i did.I've been using the hide/turn in trick and so far it's worked fine,to counter that I've done a little seal running(probably about 15 or so seals total,maybe a little less,didn't count).I'm still Apprehensive to the paineel mob,can't remember his name atm.Question is,should i try the hide/turn in trick on lhranc or just normal turn in,and has it been confirmed the hide works on lhranc? <br />
<br />
thanks in advance<br />

<br />
I'm not 100% sure, but I recall most people saying that it took arund 5 to 8 trips to get enough faction to start the epic, and as long as you took all of the steps from there on, you'll be okay.  I know it took 8 trips for my Iksar SK to get the 'my hero' message.  But I never got farther than that. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kuvak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have heard people having big problems for skipping parts of their epic, so I decide not to skip any of it when I did mine. I got mine over a year ago now, and still use it. It's not really too late at this point to go back and do the parts you skipped is it? No. Why not just do the whole thing? Oh well, if you must you must. But it's a risk, so tread carefully.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Wedgey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">We all have a right to be outraged about the epic.  It was outdated by Luclin amongst other reasons that I know I dont need to ramble on about here.  We all know that it doesnt measure up with the time and energy that needs to be put into it to complete it.  How many people have them, after all?  I'm sure all of you, like me can name all the people on your server, and even other servers who have them - point being... not a lot of folks do it, and there is a reason for that.<br />
<br />
Epic quest expansions of sorts, would be an excellent idea.  I dont want them to just &quot;make it better&quot;  I still enjoy the roleplaying aspect of the game and I just think that quests in areas post - kunark is what we deserve.  We need an upgrade to our epic -- of course it shouldnt be the best weapon available to SKs, it should just be something that reflects the time spent on it and allows us to show our pride on completeing it (like particles... come on guys, where are our floating skulls breathing fire with glowing red eyes ?  We need some EVIL)<br />
<br />
Anyway... I think you all should voice your opinions... whine, moan and complain and be honest with how you feel.  How is anyone gonna know we have a problem with it if we don't speak up.  The customer is always right and we deserve something that reflects what we have worked so hard for.  The more we're heard and the louder we yell, the better chance we have of getting what we deserve.  Hey, it works for those whiney munks, why not us?!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Nycathis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">All I ask for is for the drop rate to be proportional to the number of drakes killed.<br />
<br />
So if I have killed say 100 drakes then maybe by then it will be a 10% chance or something.<br />
200 drakes its 20% per drake etc<br />
<br />
<br />
At the moment I have personally killed 270 or so drakes.....<br />
<br />
..... and .....<br />
<br />
..... not .....<br />
<br />
..... one .....<br />
<br />
..... frigging .....<br />
<br />
..... Hide .....<br />
<br />
has dropped.<br />
<br />
Not ONE!!!!</div></div><hr />

Devs dont give two shits about SK epic.  quit thinking of new ways to make them laugh at ideas which they will disregard faster then a booger they just picked and ate.</div></div><hr />
