Yesterday I FDed in Chardok, Herbalist room. we had a mad King aggro (puller thinks he stepped on the trap to King and aggroed this way, he is not sure though). After the carnage is all over, I start gathering bodies for the CR to come (was still FD).<br />
<br />
Few mins after I /quitted and logged back to clear aggro, I FDed again, repop occurs. I stood FD in the room to check respawn or help in case of involutary aggro (1 monk and 1 rogue and 1 pally were in the room aswell). Eventually a mob pop close to me, and he immediately beats me... Is there something I missed here ?<br />
<br />
@{#\~!! WTF ?! I was FD, not Fallen, and the darn mob didn't believe it... I know/guess mobs have an individual check with your FD... This is very disapointing.<br />
<br />
Second, <br />
In the evening, I camped while being invis. When I came back I wasn't invis anymore. No harm on this one, but is it working as intended ? *chuckle*</div></div><hr />

Any more questions?<br />
Welcome to the club.</div></div><hr />

Yesterday I had the same probelm on PoA 5th isle: cleric was down, took aggro from high dmgs, FD'ed 5 times in a row (sucessfull), died on a 350 hitting thingy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">synnoira</div><div class="date">03-27-2002, 07:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">sometimes it doesn't work and you haven't got a fallen massage, i don't know whether it's because you've fallen and the thing just doesn't tell you sometimes, or mobs have a certain chance of seeing through FD depending on their level <br />
i think it's probably &quot;working as intended&quot; genuinely, FD is a very powerful tool <br />
if it was 100% reliable it would, if not trivialise, definitely simplify things a great deal<br />
the game has to include an element of risk and unpredictability to be engaging, i think the flakiness of FD at times is probably entirely intentional and not just some bug</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mr_Darklove</div><div class="date">03-27-2002, 12:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I can't say anything about the Feigning, but the invis fading happens with me all the time when I go LD/Crash. Not sure why though but it does suck and can sometimes leave you in a bad situation if you're in a high level KoS place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Exuo</div><div class="date">03-27-2002, 12:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i get that on 85% of the mobs in fear, <br />

&quot;working as intended&quot;  :-(</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Razziel</div><div class="date">03-27-2002, 12:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you go LD or Crash, you're still on the server for at least another 30 seconds, so if your unlucky, your invis can fade naturally (or any buff/effect) before you get bumped off the server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nikumu</div><div class="date">03-27-2002, 03:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats what I thought was the issue as well Razziel, but after what I thought was a fluke (invis and IU being down whenever I have /q out crashed out of the game) I did some testing.   It seems that anytime you leave the game by /q or Linkdeath it removes all invis effects.  Test it out.   This is a recent (like last month or so) change.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This might be the explanation. I did assist for Corpse pulling while FD.<br />
<br />
Good to know if that's really what made the mob KOS.</div></div><hr />
