<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Oggi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all!<br />
<br />
Quick simply question.<br />
What god shall i choose to believe in as Ogre?<br />
:confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Manslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Rallos Cultural is damn nice, Cazic stuff is also quite nice.  But atm, it really doesn't matter too much overall.  Just pick what you think is cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Oggi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ok, so the SK class dosent have something like ei. the rangers does.<br />
<br />
Rangers who pick Tunare, are able to quest the helm of tracker, are able to use the blessed faydark thunderbolt bow etc.<br />
<br />
Thoose are items that if the SK race had similar that I would be angry if I couldent use becourse i picked a wrong diety.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Paynreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You cannot get the Greenmist (without some crazy shit) if you worship Rallos Zek. Besides, CT is just cooler.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Not to mention that most of the Cazic Thule cultural armor has a STA bonus which the Rallos Zek armour (Crimson Darkscale) does not.<br />
<br />
On a full suit of CT cultural (Fulvous Darkscale), you gain 40 Stamina over Crimson Darkscale.<br />
<br />
I can't remember the colour of CT armour.  The RZ armor is red.<br />
<br />
I really wish I'd picked CT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gnatz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I look like a bumble bee...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yikes.  Give us a pic, Gnatz?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grimmtooth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Interesting, I never new that the CT armor had that much more STA than the Rallos Crimson Drakscale.<br />
<br />
I think the +40 STA statement above is a little misleading, though: some os those pices included in a full set are not ones that a high level SK would typically wear.  Of the Darkscale pieces that I would wear, there is a 30 STA difference between Crimson and Fulvous:<br />
<br />
2 Bracers: +10 STA<br />
Boots: +5 STA<br />
Collar: +5 STA<br />
Greaves: +5 STA<br />
Pauldrons: +5 STA<br />
<br />
I would consider the helms about equal, trading INT for STA.<br />
<br />
Still, that is 30 STA, equal to 150 Hitpoints (assuming you haven't capped STA - which may be an issue with an ogre particularly).<br />
<br />
Looks like a pretty convincing argument for choosing CT over RZ...although I would hate to stroll around Norrath in yellow armor.<br />
;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zemi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Rallos Zek is the god that lead ogres to their peak, battling the gods in the plans, whereas Cazic Thule is the god of the horrid lizards from across the Greenblood river.<br />
<br />
<br />
Either way though, it shouldn't *really* matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Oggi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Those armor types you talk about here..Cultural...?<br />
<br />
What is that, quest armor or drop armor?. <br />
I never heard of it before, so any info on them would be great.<br />
<br />
And if its quest, then a guide of some kind would really help.<br />
<br />
-Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Flatstompa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Cultural armor is made by Ogre Grandmaster smiths...<br />
<br />
Also take CT, do you want to worship the freak who got the ogres cursed or a mutant (yet scary) turtle? Eh? Ehhh?<br />
<br />
But if you worship RZ, your faction might be easier to fix in some places... even most light races can worship RZ, whereas CT is truly evil. It's your choice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Baraxul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">rallos zek worshippers have better faction when it comes to velious quest armors<br />
<br />
and i can't see greenmist being a deciding factor, i'm sorry :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Oggi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Thanks for the reply guys.<br />
<br />
Now, after reading that cultural armor is player made, I rushed into eq traders webpage to se how I start smithing the best way.<br />
<br />
I then went into game, and spend all the points  in smithing and found the forge and smithing suppliers.<br />
Now, is it just me, or cant the noob smithing stuff be found in Oggok....scalar mold and lamp mold?? <br />
<br />
I ran around for something like an hour to find the stuff, but dident.<br />
<br />
So, I figured that you Ogre GM smiths out there, might be able to help as were to find the best place to practice, without having to run around to much??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Just an addendum: I thought I'd check darksplint (shaman armour), and it seems to have at least some of the same STA bonuses on Fulvous, not included on Crimson or Blackened.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Shayl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I found the easiest spot to smith was Shadowhaven.  You won't be KoS to start with, and with an hour of faction quests you'll be indifferent to the merchants.   Eventually you will need to do some quests in Shar Vahl, so that you can make Shadowscream.  So don't slaughter the kitties.  I wrote a guide about 8 weeks ago on smithing, here on the board.  Search for it!<br />
<br />
A word of warning - it takes a particular breed of insanity to become a high level smith.  It is incredibly time-consuming, and can also be extremely expensive.  If you LOVE it, then do it.  If you just might kinda like some armor, kill monsters, get some cash, and buy armor from your friendly obsessive neighborhood ogre smith.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Oggi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Thanks Shayl.<br />
Will search for you other post.<br />
<br />
I did find my way to Sha vahll my self the other night.<br />
I spendt 3 hrs there, and got my smithing to 100, for the cost of<br />
150pp I beleive.<br />
<br />
And that got me thinking.<br />
Smithing isent easy, I know that, but compared to all the faction work, resist raising, not to mention lvl requrement there is for ToV, HoT armor, and the luck needed to win rolls on drops, I went throu with my old main.<br />
<br />
Then aiming for cultural smithing isent that insane?<br />
And, cultural armor can be used from lvl 46 im im not mistaken?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Rhone Darkarrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">the sta on fulvous is alot better, but, its not that hard to max the sta on an ogre to begin with, and like someone else said, only a few of the pieces that matter would be worn by a higher level sk with access to raids and such anyhow.  Besides, what sk in their right mind could go around in yellow armor? that stuff is just hideous.  that stuff would be excellent for a troll tho</div></div><hr />

<br />
Incedentally, I wonder if there are any friendly obsessive neighborhood ogre smiths on Zeb that can quote me for a set of Blackened Darkscale?  I know it's expensive, but I haven't ever seen Blackened up for sale on Zeb.  Occasionally there are a few pieces of Crimson, and very rarely a piece of Fulvous.<br />
<br />
I'll be heading to CC as soon as I can PL my Shammy friend up a few levels to go with me, so I may possibly come into some decent cash very soon, would just like to know how much cash I need to raise to get myself a set of the armor.  I can concur that starting an ogre smith just to make the armor sets is about as fun as sticking a red hot poker in your rectum, tried it, still haven't got her above 35 in smithing after a few months.   Of course, I don't really have the money at the moment to smith full time on that toon.<br />
