The supposed key quest starts with a NPC in umbra but the quest is not publicly solved yet and I wouldn't expect it to be announced for a while because any guild who finishes it would be insane to tell everyone until they had gathered enough keys for their members.</div></div><hr />

Basically, there was an amulet that was broken during a storm that struck Maidens Eye and some other areas in the History of Luclin.  There is a box that you get that holds 10 items.  All Tiny.  So far it seems that these items called Luclin Shards have started dropping and being cataloged.  They are lore, but ID with different names.  5 differnt ones have been found so far.  But no one has stated they have solved the quest yet.</div></div><hr />
