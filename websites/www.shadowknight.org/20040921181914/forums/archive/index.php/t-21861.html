<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Originally from the Community Leaders discussion thread on Graffe's (http://www.graffe.com/forums/showthread.php?t=19042)<br />
(1) What sort of priority is backflagging taking? (I know its been brought up in that other thread but looking for 1 clear quoteable concise answer)<br />
<br />
Backflagging is a priority, however we have not decided on how best to impliment a system. So it currently stands at an &quot;in discussion&quot; phase.<br />
<br />
<br />
Make raid flags available in three ways:<br />
<br />
1) The normal way - beating the event, etc.  <br />
<br />
2) Be a current member of a guild that has X members flagged (possibly a %...) and has completed the flag event X times.  <br />
<br />
3) Receive the flag via &quot;naturalization,&quot; so to speak.  Have the flag via membership to a guild for X time and spend X time in the flagged zone and receive the individual flag.  <br />
<br />
This would remove the backflagging strains on guilds, but without completely trivializing the importance of flag mobs.  You wouldn't just kill the mob once and have your guild tag flagged and never worry about it, like some have suggested - you'd still have to do the event a few times.  If a guild died off, they wouldn't have continual collective access to flag zones for new members.  Members who leave a guild would not loose access to zones they've gained access to, either by actually beating the event or by simply having been associated with the flag long enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Trysbrina67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think option 3 is the best and should have been implimented when PoP first came out.  Just one minor change tho;<br />
<br />
The number of people who actually earned the flag (means killing the raid target) must remain at 85% for new guild members to be temp flagged and over time eventually perma-flagged.<br />
<br />
Edit - Guildleaders (and maybe officers) should have the ability to give temp flags to apps so they can raid etc with the rest of the guild.  Make the temp flags for them last 24 hours or something.<br />
<br />
It would have solved so many problems in the days when this expansion was top end.  No more getting screwed out of zones because you had to work when the guild was doing mob x.  No more flagging apps just so they can raid with you on the content you need them in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rhumba_Kween</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I raid with a small group of people, mostly belonging to only a couple of guilds. Whatever they decide, it needs to be somehow set up so that it allows even non guild members to get the backflags.<br />
<br />
My thought would be, maybe some special fight that you had to win to give certain flags. Or maybe even something like, if you're flagged to a certain point, or if so many people in a raid are flagged through a certain point, you could request a &quot;Special&quot; fight that is similar caliber to the flagging fight, but this fight could be requested at anytime. And maybe make it so that these flagging mobs did not drop loot.<br />
<br />
I think, the biggest problem with backflagging is finding the mobs up. If you could kill the mobs for flags, and not have to worry about catching it up, it would make it a heck of alot easier.<br />
<br />
Anyway, thats my 2 cents. No matter how they do it, its probably going to take alot of work on their part.</div></div><hr />

It's not a &quot;pick one&quot; - it's a &quot;do all these.&quot;<br />
<br />

It's called a raid-in.  <br />

I disagree very strongly.  It has exorbitant potential for abuse, and would basically remove the point of flags.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Going to explain? Or just want me to take your word for it... I gave some ways to do it so that it requires lots of people that are already flagged. Or are you one of those that thinks any groups that raid and are not all in the same guild are of the Devil. When you make declaritive statements, and expect us to just take your word for it, I guess we have to interpret what you meant... /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Moonslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If it was allowed to flag non members of a guild via that method, you would just have newbs tagging along on every raid until they got flagged. Eventually they'd find someone to flag them for everything pretty much, and the actual flagging events would be obsolete.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">What you suggested wasn't a backflagging change, it was a request for instanced flag mobs.  That's rather different.  As for making the same sort of backflagging changes available to non-guild groups as guilds, it would be easy to sell access to the flags etc. - there's nothing attached to being a member of a public channel or anything like there is with a guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rhumba_Kween</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">And there is nothing to keep you from selling flaggage, by letting someone be part of the guild for set amount of time and letting you raid for that amount of time.

<br />
I don't see the real problem with working around our usual raiding situation Rhumba.  Any character not guilded or in another guild that doesn't meet the flagging could just join up with one of our guilds that would be flagged during the raid.  Minor inconvenience really.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As I said, if its kept through guilding. There will be guilds selling flags also. I don't see how limiting it to guildage helps if the purpose is selling them. Unless its something that you loose your backflagging flags if you leave that guild. But I can't see them doing that.<br />

<br />
Most likely if they tie it to Guild, they will have some type of numeric quota on it. Meaning that inorder to use it, the guild needs to have X number of people flagged. I highly doubt whatever they set this at, that any but maybe one of the guilds will be able to hit it, and that will be if they set it at 20 or below. <br />
<br />
We will see, but I still think that however they do this, it will need to involve making the backflagging more convenient, rather than removing it altogether.<br />

I agree with what you say. No matter how they do this, people will be exploiting it through selling them or filing false guild apps or selling guild apps. Because of this, it should allow for Guilds that are small that raid together to use this backflagging system, whatever it is.</div></div><hr />

A respectable guild is very likely to allow a fucktard elemental access for a fee if they can do so from out of the guild.

If you could get flags in similar fashion to that which I described without it being tied to a guild, what's to stop public &quot;organizations&quot; from growing exponentially until you get to the point where anyone who wants it can have elemental access or PoTime access or whatever else?

Why are does any guild deserve a &quot;shortcut&quot;?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Rhumba_Kween</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">No respectable guild is going to allow a fucktard into their guild for a month just to make some money off of them.

<br />
Then let me get this straight. It's ok for a &quot;non-respectable&quot; guild to sell flags. But it's not ok for a respectable multi small guild alliance to be able to backflag because that might allow &quot;non-respectable&quot; public organizations from getting backflagging done?<br />
<br />
This multi guild alliances would need to have enough people already flagged to do what I'm proposing, just like the Larger Guilds would, but because they are not part of the same guild you don't think they should have access to backflagging. I'm just not understanding how you can get to the point where its fine for &quot;non-respectable&quot; guilds to sell flags, but its not fine for a Multi Guild alliance to backflag...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Because backflagging contributes to the attrition seen in high level guilds, and that's bad for the health of the game.  If you look at what I suggested, it wouldn't cheapen having the flags any really, it'd just reduce the strain backflagging can put on a guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Mystereon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">It always sucks to lose friends in guild. But if more guilds were willing to let nonguild members on flag raids (which doesn't cost them anything unless person is an idiot) then there would be a larger pool of people to draw from if they need to replace members. I really like the idea of keeping backflagging guilds from taking a mob that another guild needs to even get there in the first place though. It just kinda chaps my butt the way some guilds are about letting other people participate in a flag raid sometimes. Sure they don't owe me crap but I have a couple of friends in other guilds that wanted to invite me along on a couple and got told I could rot in hell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I understand not allowing other non-members to raid with your guild perfectly.  For one, if you do it for one person, you'll be expected to do it for others.  It goes against the competative nature of the raiding game to flag raiders who will potentially be raiding with a competing guild.  Simply, alot of people don't want people they don't know and trust on a raid with them, and quite understandably so considering what one person can do to a raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Mystereon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Understandable in lots of ways. But if a guild is backflagging from time and doing say RZ is it really any threat to them if I (with say at least 2 members vouching for me) tag along? If they really want to keep that tight a lock on things let them do the work of back flagging. I do understand about having everyone and their brother wanting to drag their &quot;Hawt cybering&quot; g/f who is lvl 50 along or bringing a bunch of morons who may cause a wipe (hell 1 real moron can be enough). <br />
<br />
But it kind of comes back to why should it be easy for them to back flag? If higher guilds drop below raiding capable force then that is also a function of competition to me.<br />
<br />
Still when it comes down to it I support a backflagging alternative of some sort to keep really high end guilds from monopolizing (spelling?) Flag mobs. It does seem kind of dumb to me for the competition to be who can sit around waiting for a mob to spawn to be a deciding factor in some/many cases vice actual skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Naraz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Okay here my fav solution <br />
<br />
PoP<br />
EP need to be just a little easier to get to becuase they are exp zones and really take to long to flag for them.<br />
make it so you just need sayran,  RZ, mm anger and bert.<br />
 or make it if you have a higher tier god you dont need that lower tier crap like no grumfat or hedge if you have tt. fact is Guilds wont backflag for the little stuff and you end up having to exp in bot and ldon while rest of your guild is in EP exp heaven. heck tz been up here fo rlike over a months lol.<br />
<br />
time okay how it is though except maybe add guidl flag system for that<br />
<br />
GoD<br />
rando = kt. <br />
uqua and ikk up it 72 raid size, maybe put a little regen mod for every boss for if you go over 54 ifya want. you know lot of people liek to bot alts and people hate to sit out of raids, this smaller raid sizes sucks ya knwo hehe<br />
quiv+-not there yet but from what it sound slike they need to add way to raid people over. hear lot of peeps are having # problems past KT hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Mystereon - Guilds can decide to allow you to tag along if they want to, but you being bitter that they don't want someone (you) around is simply fucking pathetic.  <br />
<br />
Naraz - The point is not to make it easier to get access to the flag zones - if you want to discuss how easy it should be to access flagged zones, start a new thread, that's not a backflagging issue, that's back to the whole casuals vs. ubers debate.  As far as being able to XP in the EP's with your guild or whatever, what I've suggested (which is very much along the lines of what has been beeing discussed) would accomplish exactly that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Zero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">The % of the guilds member base having the flag idea would cause problems. Many many guilds allow alts to be guilded.<br />
<br />
Am I the only one that thinks the amount of work it takes to get to &quot;Ep exp heaven&quot; is fine? Why the hell would you join an EP guild if you still needed all lower tier pop flags? Skipping content = suck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">&quot;Naturalized&quot; flags would count toward the total flags or whatever, so I don't see it being a major issue.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Naraz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">i dont think the guild system would work unless you get to keep the flags when you move on and stuff. maybe make it so when you kill a god, you get like 72 flags banked in the guilld system that you can pass out later or make eles start giving tradable shields like in the ep. but you need to be able to keep the flags and not be based off a % guild thing, otherwise it make people that got alts vary pissed they cant be guilded and people do move on and stuff  ya know, wouldn't be fair to remove their status jsut beause of that.<br />

dont think they'll go for the guild thing anyways, just thinking best next solution is to fix the huge # of flags ya need to do in teh 1st place. how would just needing to kill the hard gods be any different from what ya need now except without mindless stuff you need that people wont do hehe. fact is lot of servers have no flag sharing and guild wise if it takes more then a group, like epics/quest like bic, you can pretty much forget it:).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well the possibility of flagging a guild tag for an event rather than just individual players has already been in consideration/discussion, so I'd say they're more likely to impliment something along those lines than anything else.  As for reducing the number of flags you need, that's only ever an issue on backflagging.  Removing the lower flag requirements would serve only to further fuck up lower guild progression and encourage further attempts at content skipping - that's not a good thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Belyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Could add something to the post quarm dead script like, hail the egg and receive flags and keys(earth b and bertoxx room) for all pop zones.

<br />
Could change earth b to allow slotting in.<br />
<br />
Im not sure i would warm up to the idea of ever allowing the requirements of killing the 4 elemental gods to be circumnavigated to get into time.  Though i do have a problem with the lack of availability of fro due to the gimpness of that god/encounter.  I would suggest making him spawn more and give less loot, or make him like the earth a rings, where the event is always triggerable and will always give flags, but only drops loot every 72 hours(think thats its current timer).  That being said, i would not change the corinav ring.</div></div><hr />

Just about all of them will say they like needing less people to accomplish stuff, while it does suck to tell someone they have to sit out it's an either/or situation you aren't going to get both and I would rather bench the non playing people or poor players than be forced to recruit 200 bodys to handle mobs, many others agree with that thinking.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Culdahl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Flags serve the purpose of slowing down the best guilds from raping an expantion before most have even purchased it...this shouldn't change.  What should change though is flagging for newer raiders or smaller guild raiders.  The purpose of flagging changes when further expansions come out and most of the big guilds have moved on....the target is no longer lewt and fun, rather it becomes purely for the purpose of moving on to the next level, which is tedious at best.  Flagging is solely responsable for driving a wedge between the haves and have-nots IMO...the number of peeps willing and/or capable of doing planar progression seems to be dwindling by the day, which leaves newer peeps like me waiting patiently outside looking in hoping someone will allow me to tag along (I'm a pre-EP SK, it's not like I have any use on a raid aside for taking up space and the occassional HT).  <br />
<br />
  What I would do is make alternate quests to progress through the various planar mobs.....By this I mean lengthy and somewhat difficult quests that require an equal amount of time and effort, but not the vast amount of peeps needed to drop a planar mob.  This would allow more people to progress to EP and beyond which would give bigger guilds more options when it comes to new recruits.  BTW, these quests should only be put in place when it is clear that the majority of raiding guilds have moved on to other things and that there is little hope of their &quot;back-flagging&quot; anyone else.<br />
<br />
P.S. - Although the loot is decent on some planar progression mobs, it is not nearly as worth it to us as it was to those that did this a long time ago...I have passed on several drops from planar mobs because the tradable equip I have is either as good or close to as good and someone else could benefit more.  Plus, LDoN loot at 65 is typically better if you're willing to put forth the time to get it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Skoggel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Flagging is still a pretty bad idea, and it seems since PoP sony has realized that. I'm not 100% sure on how OoW will turn out, I tend not to follow new expansion info too closely until it gets really close to being out simply because things change a lot, but memory seems to say there will be very little flagging in it.<br />
<br />
Flags serve the purpose of slowing down the best guilds from raping an expantion before most have even purchased it...this shouldn't change.<br />
<br />
Sounds good, but isn't really a true situation. You can still read archives from various guilds' websites as they progressed through PoP - they were naturally having problems with mobs in progression. This is the usual way of things.. takes a few tries, then you get a new mob. Gear tends to improve in your gear as you farm these and equivalent mobs, then you move on.<br />
<br />
People would not have walked into Time when PoP opened up and started cleaning it out. Just look at Velious - there was no artificial stuff blocking guilds from cleaning out NToV, and it took time for guilds to get in there regardless. Progression was intact, just not enforced by a system.<br />
<br />
Flagging does let you do other things, like having rewards in a zone easy to get, intended only for people who have progressed that far (elem one group minis come to mind.) Flexibility in design like this is good, but not at the expense of all the current problems flagging causes that exist in game.</div></div><hr />

The point is to reduce the strains of backflagging - that's what the original topic I was referring to from the post-summit forum discussions was talking about, and that's what this thread is about.  <br />
<br />
The goal is not to make it easier for Casual_Guild_87 to get into the EP's, the goal is to reduce the strain backflagging puts on guilds, particuarly in terms of attrition.  Backflagging causes some noteworthy problems for guilds at times - if a guild needs to recruit a handful of new members to fill a loss, they have to backflag for them.  This backflagging can then drive away some existing members, causing them to recruit more, etc.  It can be a viscious circle contributing to the attrition at the high-end.  The object is to ease this, rather than making access easier to get in the first place.</div></div><hr />

I dont see why back flagging should be easier for a raid force consisting of guild only, as opposed to a competent small guild alliance.  Guild alliances have the same types of back flagging problems as raiding guilds.  If the alliance has the ability to take out the flag mobs then why should they be excluded from the back flagging benefits?  <br />
<br />
The idea is not to allow goobers to skip content, but to allow competent multi-guild raid forces the same benefits.  I agree that the back flagging solution should not allow raid forces to drag large quantities of people through at a time.  If a solution similar to what Rhumba suggested is used, limits and requirements could be placed on the event to prevent mass dragging.  If the event required a very high percentage of people to already have the flag, a very low number of flags given out, a delay after successfully winning the event, and no loot, that would discourage people from farming.  The raid force still needs to be competent enough to win the event and with only a very few flags given out I really dont see this being farmed.<br />
<br />
No matter what method is used for back flagging you will have beggars and exploiters.  As it is now every flagging event we do brings the beggars out of the woodwork.  A multi-guild back flagging event similar to what was brought up in this thread will not make this any worse then it is now.</div></div><hr />

I'll be interested to see what sony comes up with. Backflagging isn't fun for casual raiders (pick ups) because they loose mobs they want, and it's not fun for guilds cause we really have better things to do then kill mobs that don't even drop loot our twinks want &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">This won't be easy to design so that there are no easy ways to exploit the system. But with L 70 on the horizon, access to the elemental zones is going to be a necessity for almost all players. There will most likely be a deconstruction of the entire PoP flag progression checklist. It seems likely that getting an advanced PoP flag like RZ would eventually count for all those flags that would normally be below it. PoP is an aging expansion, and in order for lower end raiders to participate in GoD and OoW, it seems likely that many of the roadblocks to gear placed by PoP will be lessened. I just hope that they instance Time before the floodgates open...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Agarwaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">SOE already long since learnt their errors regarding backflagging.  GoD is nowhere near the flagging mess PoP was.  Rondo was a good example of this.<br />
<br />
SOE are, inevitably, going to expand the options for PoP flagging.  They have to, not due to the whiner uber guilds (who need to move onto god, and fast or they are far from uber), but because the content has to serve a purpose for those that follow, or soe create major headaches for themselves.  Leave it too long and the whole expansion will be practically redundant without having captured a player base.<br />

PoP is an ancient expansion.  There is little, to no, need to protect this content.  In rp terms the 'lore' is out for those who would discover its secrets.  Doing so will just frustrate casual players while doing nothing for uber guilds other than polishing their vanity.</div></div><hr />

I wouldnt count on guilds that can beat time abandoning it any time soon.  Killing quarm is a one day a week thing for many guilds, rotting loot aside it usually yeilds the same amount of meaningful loot in that one day that they get (meaningful god loot) raiding god the other 6 days of the week.<br />
<br />
Changeing the flag system through the elemental planes is fine and needed, but I wouldnt drop the requirements for having to kill the 4 elemental gods to get into time.  The only change i would make to the time requirement is perhaps making the trigger for fro always up and able to spawn the event using the 3 day timer to have the event yeild loot/or not...it would give flags every time.<br />
<br />
Also worth mentioning, is most new people that get backflagged in my guild are time flagged before they are elemental flagged, unless they come in with a healthy amount of flags.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Katollos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">What about this...Once a guild kills (x) flag mob (x) number of times the guild as a whole is flagged.  This would not rule out individual flags however.  Say your guild is EP flagged, but you yourself are missing say Bert.  You leave your guild, you are no longer EP flagged, but retain the flags you were there for while you are flying solo.  This would reward loyality to ones guild while at the same time avoiding selling flags.<br />
<br />
Just a thought, please post critizsm<br />
<br />
Edit: 100% of your raid force, yes 100%, must of your guild during flag mob kills to get a guild flag.  The mob must also be killed multiple times.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">That's basically EXACTLY what I proposed, except without the flag naturalization that would be essential - you have someone join a PoTime guild, raid with them, kill quarm with them, and then one day the guild breaks up or they're forced to move on for whatever reason, and they can no longer do certain things with friends or join another guild in the same place in progression?  No, that's a very bad thing.  Flag naturalization would be essential; it shouldn't be something that happens quickly, else you'll have some of the problems lamented earlier in this thread, but it must happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Katollos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Very, very good idea.  But I agree with you it needs to be a very long process.  The flag progress sucks, but it's rewarding.<br />

Also, we would have to tag all of our new recruits right away so they can raid with us. Which sucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Skaarx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">What would you think about flags affecting the whole account, not just a single char. or maybe all 60-65 chars on that account?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Rhumba_Kween</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">The point is to reduce the strains of backflagging - that's what the original topic I was referring to from the post-summit forum discussions was talking about, and that's what this thread is about.  <br />
<br />
The goal is not to make it easier for Casual_Guild_87 to get into the EP's, the goal is to reduce the strain backflagging puts on guilds, particuarly in terms of attrition.  Backflagging causes some noteworthy problems for guilds at times - if a guild needs to recruit a handful of new members to fill a loss, they have to backflag for them.  This backflagging can then drive away some existing members, causing them to recruit more, etc.  It can be a viscious circle contributing to the attrition at the high-end.  The object is to ease this, rather than making access easier to get in the first place.<br />
<br />
From what you propose, it would not reduce the strains of backflagging, it would entirely eliminate any backflagging for large guilds, and keep in place the strains for the rest. No one is saying the solution should only be for smaller guilds. It's just some of us think this should benefit everyone who can muster enough flagged people to do backflagging.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Rhumba_Kween</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">If it's an alliance of say 3 small guilds, they'd be in exactly the same situation as a large guild for the most part - the only type of groups that wouldn't benefit are public channels and shit... just think about it logically for a second.<br />
<br />
Lets say you have 5 small guilds that raid, and most of the guilds have 6-10 that raid with the group. Think of the ramification of this situation. Do you make it so that any guild that has 6-10 members that are flagged can be backflagged? It seems to me that the much better solution is tie the backflagging to a special event that can only be activated with X number of already flagged people. It would benefit the most people then. Just like you're proposal, flags could still be sold. The only difference being that this method would benefit everyone by relieving the stress of backflagging, while not removing it completely for only the Guilds that meet the requirements.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>scpio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">eh just allow the 85% rule to work in ANY zone that requires a key or flag. it works great for elementals  and covers most of everones concerns. they should make it work in TIME and it should work in GOD as well. those are the areas with the concerns and before it was in the elementals. dont need to reinvent the wheel here.<br />
<br />
really its perfect makes a guild have to progress but doenst stop new players from working with the guild. <br />
<br />
though id like a naturalization system that over say 25 - 30 raids in so and so zone your flaged by attendance. events such as god raids where you can only enter once every 3 days means its harder to be &quot;flaged&quot;. thus the need for guilds to bottom feed is removed slowly.</div></div><hr />
