<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">1) Give us the ability to sell-back our LDoN Equipment to the LDoN merchants at a reduced amount of adventure points...maybe a 10% reduction.<br />
<br />
2) Give us the ability to remove augments from our armor without destroying them. But maybe reduce their value. IE: if you had a +6 Str augment, and you removed it from your armor, it would become +5 str instead.<br />
<br />
3) Give us the ability to combine augments together to make a better one...IE: 2 +5 Poison Resistance Augements = 1 +6 Poison Resistance Augment.<br />
<br />
4) Give us the ability to sell dropped augments from adventures to LDoN Merchants at a reduced rate...IE: if a +5 augment cost 100 points from merchant, and we got one that dropped in an adventure, let us sell it to them for 90 adventure points.<br />
<br />
5) Make treasure chests worth more. Give them better items or more $$. (Rogues would be happy!)<br />

Oh, and happy Monday Morning Everyone. I hope you all had a good weekend. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It will never happen, but yeah, I can pretty much agree with all of those except the selling back of dropped augments.<br />
<br />
Especially the sellback of gear, there are a couple of pieces I wish I could swap out now. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xanathol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">From a player standpoint, giving the *chance* to not lose an aug when removing it, or the ability to sell back gear &amp; augs would be beautiful, but from the SoE point of view, it will never happen. Losing augs and gear means more play time in these zones, meaning keeping you are in these zones longer, playing longer, lower load on other servers vs the ones setup to loadbalance these instances, etc. LDoN was a great cash-cow idea for SoE. For me, it's the bane of my existance and is on the verge of burning me out on EQ yet again...one more &quot;want an LDoN?&quot; request and I may snap!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Stattic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ok from what I understand is that you can sell back the items that you buy with your points. I may be wrong but I know a friend of mine had used his points to buy a spell and actually got the wrong one for his class. He then went and turned it in to an NPC and got his points back(not sure all of them). Like I said I could be wrong..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Belyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">As much as id like to be able to recover a few augs, making that possible would be a detrement to the game.  Ldon is the only place in the game where ya can group with a stranger that completely outclasses you in equipment and sometimes in level too.  It provides opertunities for struggleing people to aquire gear that they normally wouldnt have access too due to lvl, playing skills and outright lack of gear.  I do alot of pick up ldons because im impatient.  Normally weather its an easy or hard mission, half the group doesnt even care about the dropped items, while at least one person there is creaming themselves over it.  Even the common stuff that I and many others wont even bother going in on because its not worth the effort to sell it there is almost always someone that would love to take the time to earn a few kpp.  Unless you are completely indiffernt to improving your toon with augments, the wayfairers brotherhood is something that the end game folks are gonna keep coming back to for awhile as equipment is continiously upgraded.</div></div><hr />

Gasp! I won't ask you again to join our guild group for any more LDON runs.. I'll spare your sufferings.. :D<br />

Croaak, I understand that some of your suggestions are more of Diablo 2 like augmentation combinations. Diablo 2 rocks for this and would be fun to see EQ adopted more of this.. :)</div></div><hr />
