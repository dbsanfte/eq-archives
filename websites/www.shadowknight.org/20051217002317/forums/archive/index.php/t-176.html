<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Soldara</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 11:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some of you may have read this (http://www.avault.com/articles/getarticle.asp?name=mmogsell ) editorial regarding Blacksnow's case against Mythic entertainment. After reading the article I felt like I had to say something.<br />
<br />
First off, I'm not a huge fan of EB players but I also don't think that people should be prohibited from buying or selling characters/items online. The problem I see with allowing the selling of in-game items is the possibility of commercial guilds developing. My fear is that individual players would find themselves competing with 'employees' for in game content.<br />
<br />
I honestly can't say how much this might effect the balance of the game world but I believe it would significant impact on the middle to high level gamer. Don't get me wrong, I don't think any development company should have the right to forbid me to do whatever I want with my character or items. If I did sell my character (which I wouldn't), the person who bought it would still have to pay the monthly fee to play.<br />
<br />
Development companies wouldn't lose money if they allowed the buying and selling of content for real dollars, but I do fear that the legitimate player would be effected.<br />
<br />
If I ran a development company, I would not for bide real world transactions of characters and items, but I would feel the need to limit commercial opportunities.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krazaak</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 02:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I personally dislike the sale of game items or characters for cash.  <br />
<br />
It is bad enough to compete with people farming items to sell for plat, but generally those people don't make a full time business of it, since their goal is usually just better equipment for the character they are playing.<br />
<br />
Individuals farming gear for RL profit go a step beyond that, they're competing with you in game to pay their rent.  Most of these people aren't playing the game, their farming items to sell to you, items that you could probably have gotten on your own if they weren't farming them.<br />
<br />
Companies who make a business out of farming and selling EQ items takes it the extreme.  Now you potentially have groups of dedicated farmers who could totally dominate specific loot drops, pretty much requiring you to buy an item from them.<br />
<br />
The only person these people are helping is themselves, at the expense of everyone else who plays the game.</div></div><hr />

On Verants Hardware, using their copywrited material...<br />
<br />
To add a bit more of my own perspective to it. Verant is offering a service. If you want it, you pay for it, and abide by the rules they outline in their EULA. Quite honestly it is irrelevant what their rules are, though ethically there is a limit to what those rules could be... They aren't telling ya how to spend your time.. They are telling you if you wanna spend your time playin EQ, there are a few rules you to follow...:cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wyrmwood B'Dynn</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 03:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can even take it one step farther. There is someone on my server that runs upto 5 characters at a time and levels people for something like 10 dollars an hour. This person makes a living doing this and dominates certain camp spots to make real life money. Tho this person is a friend of mine I strongly disagree with being able to buy levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bludge</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 04:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Blacksnow didn't legitimitely level characters or acquire items.  In fact, selling characters is a minor part of their &quot;business plan&quot;.  Their actual business revolves around selling duped items and the in game cash that comes from selling those duped items to vendors.  They don't hack the client, but they use errors in the code that allow exploits.  You will notice that they were primarily AO and now DAoC driven, correct?  That's because Verant is a much more solid bit of programming and takes the sanctity of earning your way very seriously.<br />
<br />
Don't let their &quot;Gamer's Bill Of Rights&quot; fool you. It's just a smokescreen Blacksnow created to try to build sympathy amongst the gaming community so that they could continue their rampant exploitation and money laundering scams.  They don't give a rat's ass about the gamer. All they care about is that people continue to pay them for items and cash.<br />
<br />
AVault, in the linked post above,  has couched this argument as strictly an issue from the perspective of Joe Gamer who spends 6 months leveling his character, quits the game and makes a few bucks by ebaying. I don't know why they've chosen to put up such a false presentation of the facts.  Perhaps they know people at Blacksnow.<br />
<br />
The *real* story of what this is all about is here<br />

<br />
The best and most insightful information of all is in the icq logs provided by Blacksnow's Director of Sales, Lee Caldwell to Unknownplayer.  Why they would want to post their own logs which would reveal them as the criminals that they are is beyond me.  All I can think of is that Caldwell must think that Showing Young to be agreeing to work some back room deals makes Funcom look guilty. He must *still* not realize that he was played and played hard.  As soon as Funcom had the info they needed, they shut Caldwell and Blacksnow down fast and pulled back all of the concessions they had made as part of &quot;the deal&quot;.<br />
<br />
The logs between Caldwell and Adam Young, Lead Database Admin for Funcom.  How Young finesses Caldwell into giving up his exploits is pure, undercover genius. <br />
<br />
Here they are.<br />

<br />
It's back alley extortion and con artistry at it's finest.  It's pure, simply, out of control greed and a complete disregard for the property of others OR the MMORPG community.  We are simply sheep for them to fleece.</div></div><hr />

<br />
All of the lore.com sites are owned by the same person who operates Blacksnow.  everlore.com is included.  It was stated that the only reason he uses the everlore.com email address anymor3e is to get into betas.   As all of us know.. beta is where people find all of the exploits and bugs. <br />
<br />
Just thought people should know what type of people they are dealing with when giving those sites hits.</div></div><hr />

I think people buying and selling items and characters contributes to the demise of the gaming worlds we all play it. No matter if it's EQ, daoc, AO, UO, ac, whatever the game...<br />
<br />
I like the idea of Branding the people who have bought their stuff that Mythic was talking about doing. That way everyone knows. One way or another, the job gets done.</div></div><hr />

Yikes! Stop with the Black Helicopters .. Obsidian Technolgies owns all of the *lore.com sites and responded to Unknownplayer.com shortly after that news bit:<br />
<br />
Dear Sir<br />
<br />
We would like to clear up a few issues with your news post. Forrest Parker, one member of black snow last worked for Obsidian Technologies 1/2001. A previous member, Wes, was let go 10/2001. We have in the past allowed ex employees to keep their email as a courtesy, but all emails have now been suspended. We are in no way, shape or form connected to black snow, and have received no compensation of any kind from them or any member of their group, either personally or through Obsidian Technologies. We have already spoken to the people at Mythic, and will be happy to speak with any other interested parties involved in this debacle. Obsidian Technologies and it's partners have absolutely nothing to do with this group. Please feel free to contact me if you need further information. <br />

It would appear likely that some of these scumbag dinkweeds (BlackSnow) had kept their accounts with the gaming news nets to get the &quot;free ticket&quot; or at least a better chance at getting into future closed betas.<br />
<br />
As for the topic at large, it is phenomenal how sick the human condition is. I always felt ripping MP3's off the net (as a musician) was among the most dishonorable things one could do. My stance has liberated on that somewhat ...<br />
<br />
... then later, after becoming an EQ victim, the topic of Ebayed characters always gave me a queasy feeling .. I can almost see the argument that a player is selling his &quot;time&quot; .. but it still doesn't feel right to me.<br />
<br />
This whole scheme of BlackSnow is without a doubt, however, far above and beyond any &quot;casual ebay selling of my old character&quot;. It is a business model based on the outright exploitation of intellectual data, and to further insult the artist's (gamemaker's) work, they turn around and sell it for ridiculous amounts of money. Then they have the frelling nerve to sue the companies that banned thier accounts?!<br />
<br />
If I ever walked past these douchebags on the street I would find myself hard pressed not to show them some &quot;leet exploits&quot;<br />
<br />
Bah. Then they can sue me for something that actually makes sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Attyla</div><div class="date">03-29-2002, 06:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Soldara, gamer's rights are for Guppies.  It's a kitschy phrase bandied about to rouse passion and interest where there should be none.  That banning/dispute was for exploitation and for duping, so it's a very poor choice of example.  But for argument's sake, even if it was for simply selling in game property, it's a very poor argument.<br />
<br />
No better is the argument that I &quot;own&quot; my own emails or documents on my corporation's data storage (of course, I appreciate my companies' efforts to keep such correspondence private).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Moonnyt</div><div class="date">03-30-2002, 03:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bludge,<br />
<br />
Thanks for posting the links. I had a great time reading how Adam was playing &quot;good cop&quot;,  &quot;bad cop&quot;, he played that Lee guy out hard. Could you imagine a &quot;Sweat Shop&quot; of gamers power leveling , gaining pp and gear .. just to sell on e-bay? As a casual player ... it just seems strange to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bludge</div><div class="date">03-30-2002, 10:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, that happens.  I was an indirect acquaintance of a guy who owned a cyber cafe/lan party business.  He had about 30 workstations set up and he would pay kids to come in and level characters and obtain items.   They were paid $10 an hour and were given their own private account that he paid for. Then he would ebay the items and the characters.  Totally lame.  However, there wasn't an exploit or hack involved. These were real people, leveling legitimately. Well, of course they were abusing quests for exp and whatever, but nothing like duping items or leveling to 50 in 12 minutes like Blacksnow did.<br />
<br />
The bottom line here is that people need to understand that if it is profitable for someone to sell in game stuff for real money, then they will do whatever is necessary to maximize their profitability. They don't care a bit about gamers or the game.  Those things/people are just there to serve them.</div></div><hr />
