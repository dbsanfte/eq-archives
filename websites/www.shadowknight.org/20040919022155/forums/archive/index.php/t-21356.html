<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Transfixion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My gear is decent. I was able to solo these mobs with out a problem. Had KEI and Virt at the time, but I seriously doubt that they were needed. I ended up getting about 20% of hp taken and 20% of mana used. I was able to single pull the two standing to the right of the zone in with ease (no adds.) I'm geared about halfway with elemental gear and half storebought. So this isn't that hard.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xecr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hi,<br />
<br />
was yesterday in hate to make some drakes. Can u tell me where these 2spawn are located? Didnt find any fix spawn of drakes.<br />
<br />
Thx :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tescin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The area he is describing is the stairs to the immediate right as soon as you port up.  However, the mobs are random and are not fixed.  He just happenned to get 2 drakes there.  The only static drake spawn I am aware of is the Broodmaster PH.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xecr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ah ok, thx Tescin :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>XebarisTP</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I decided to port up there and try to solo some drakes, cause I didn't get any drake kill with my last group there, because of the group leader's tier4 exp greed. Sigh, when you finally get a group there..<br />
<br />
I would say I'm well equipped for a pre-EP player, with lots of LDoN gear and 5200hp unbuffed. I only had Cloak of Luclin on me, and it was a piece of cake. I easily killed one mob to get him out of the way, dodged another, and pulled and killed a drake. Maybe I got to 65%, or I started lifetapped from there.. You'll hate me for it, but I was lucky enough to get a drop on my first solo kill. 17th kill in a total of 4 trips before this one.<br />
<br />
Then I tried the ratman guard with Virtue. When he was at 80%, I was getting to 30'ish, so I HT'd for 9k, and got him down to 35% before I had to fd. Bummer. 3 unsoloable parts left in the Hole, where everybody hang out all the time.<br />
