<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">They banish you to the jail in the bottom of the arena.  Roughly area 19 on your map, I think.  NOT worth trying to pull them to there.<br />
<br />
Get a mage, put virtue and focus on the mage pet, have mage pet tank and do all your damage from range.  Problem solved.  Alternately, use a necro pet with virtue &amp; focus.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Boltor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Which would be a better pet to have tank, 65 earth pet, 65 beastlord pet, or 62 necro pet?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kormus the Dark Angel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Need Cleric if you want to one pet tank it.<br />
Chanters with Charm = the win there.<br />
<br />
The unslowable praesertum - do not bother to bring less than one chanter charm pet and 2 clerics or you will end up in jail.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>appren hightowerr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you have both a mage and a beastlord there (assuming both 65), have the warder tank, as it's procs have more aggro than the mage pet, although less HP. It WILL get aggro over the mage pet, so be sure its fully buffed, have the mage summon a pair of weapons, a 500hp belt, a haste mask, a bag of Phantom Plate, and focus items, and hand it to the warder.<br />
<br />
If no beastlord, use the 65 earth pet as tank over any necro pet, it tanks better than the gheylord warder, its just a question of aggro.<br />
<br />
Dont waste time with pull strategies, just Joboberize them into the ground.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Makkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">we did it with my nec pet mt cuz the mage kept going ld and no bl on raid. it was fine, clerics on fast heals, virtue on pet. it was never even close and no one got aggro..<br />
<br />
use BL pet if possible though, like it was mentioned they have really nice aggro procs that make the entire encounter safer. also their pet has considerably (close to 1k) more hp<br />
<br />
then mage earth pet, more hp than nec too. plus all the summoned armor and weps mages get..<br />
<br />
make sure everyone else's pet has taunt off<br />
<br />
pretty easy encounter, just annoying having to clear each wing, some of the mobs have a ton of hp, are really resistant to spells and gate out</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Killed one of them with my pet tanking one time... pet was buffed to hell with several healers though... had like 2 clerics, a shammy, a pally, and 2 druids or something similarly far beyond overkill, but no mage, BL, or necro lol.  I did have mage summoned shit though from bazaar.</div></div><hr />
