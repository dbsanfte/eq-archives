<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kowl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Last night I got the last scroll I needed from Mistmore for the Test of the Lord. So far I have been pretty lucky with all the drops for this one. Spent about two hours in Kaesora on the Failed Crypt Raider. About four hours in City of Mist over two nights  getting the scrolls from the Spectral Courier. Yesterday I had about 30 minutes before my guild went on a raid so I ran by Mistmore and when I got there the Assistant  Dark Librarian was up. Tagged him and went on to the raid. After the raid me (a 53 SK) a 51 Ranger and a 55 Druid ran back to Mistmore and as soon as we walked in the Library I was hit by the Dark Librarian, killed him and headed for Frontier Mountains. Cleared the room with the Enslaved Iskar twice and got the Penmaster and Penkeeper at the same time. Killed them and got the bone key and a steel key. My two buddies had to camp but I figured I would hangout here for a while longer. A couple minutes later the Penkeeper spawned again and I got the bone necklace off him.<br />
<br />
From what I have read here I only need one more key, the stone key for the turn in. I just want to make sure that is right. You only have to turn in 3 keys to the Enslaved Iskar and you don't need to turn in the bronze key? Is that right?<br />
<br />
Also have heard not only do you need a shrink potion in Droga but also need levitate. Can anyone elaborate on that?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Darknyss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You need to hand in:<br />
<br />
Stone Key: penkeeper (rare because he can drop many different keys, copper, steel, bronze, iron, and stone)<br />
Bone Key: penmaster<br />
Bone Necklace: penmaster<br />
<br />
to the &quot;enslaved iksar&quot; that responds to &quot;what of Greenmist&quot;<br />
<br />
the hardest part I had was killing the 2 iksars that DIDN'T respond to the &quot;greenmist&quot; hails... and waiting 20-25 minutes to hopefully respawn &quot;Argest&quot;...<br />
<br />
<br />
Once you go into Droga, you need to use shrink because you just handed the keys to get into the jail to Argest... besides, it's much easier to shrink yourself and go in between the jail bars than to keep trying keys in order to open the locked cell doors... and you don't want to get stuck down there since the zone revamp made the mobs much tougher... Levitate will keep you from taking damage on the drops from the trap floors in the zone (which you should use to get to the jail area) and may also help with aggro radius if invis does drop...<br />
<br />
NOTHING sees invis, however be warned, if invis is dropping, find an empty place FAST... these mobs hit for 100-200+ fast and will gang up... and casters make Feigning death VERY difficult...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Argest (enslaved Iksar) is in the Frontier Mountains now, in the Goblin Caves near the SF zone.<br />
<br />
Enter the caves and take the right tunnel, he spawns in the last room at the bottom of the tunnel... The goblins who drop the keys also spawn in this same room.<br />
<br />
I did it all in under 3 hours time.<br />
<br />
I did not have to talk to Argest, I just gave him the keys and he gave me the Needle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kowl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have spent about 8 hours camping trying to get this last key to drop. I have killed the Penkeeper about 20 times and the Penmaster about 6 times and still have not seen the stone key. This is the last thing I need to do the turn and get the damn sword. Does this key only drop from the Penmaster or is it really rare or am I just unlucky?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Took me about 3 days of camping to get all three keys.  Just keep at it, you'll get it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nazgaull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Does this key only drop from the Penmaster or is it really rare or am I just unlucky?<br />
<br />
There is the Penmaster...<br />
<br />
And... there is the Penkeeper...<br />
<br />
I've seen all the keys drop off both of them... <br />
<br />
I have seen them both up at the same time as well as seperately... I have also seen two of one of them up at the same time; ie, two penmasters at same time...<br />
<br />
I have also seen the keys drop off the other more common goblins that spawn in that room, but at much rarer drop rate.<br />
<br />
They all have a chance of dropping some random key, and there are many keys that drop that have nothing to do with our Quest at all...  I have 2 backpacks full of various keys I got there...<br />
<br />
Argest seems to have a chance to spawn at either the left or right prisoner spawn point.  People have posted in this forum seeing him spawning to the right, and I have a screenie posted here showing him spawning to the left, and I have seen him spawned on the right as well.<br />
<br />
The crazed Iksar will also attack on sight if I get too close to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kowl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well another 3 hours of keeping the room clear and still no Stone Key.  Meanwhile I went ahead and turned in the Greenmist Tome and went to OT and killed the Glowing Cliff Golem. I had a 53 SK (Me) 50 SK, 61 Rogue, and two 63 Beastlords. We couldn't get a cleric so we decided to just try it since we were right next to the book. He was easy to pull by himself and no one dropped below 80% the entire fight. As far as I know no one tried any spells so I don't know how MR he is. He was a gimp and died quickly. All I need now is the mirror and the shard which I thought would be the big hold up for me and not this stupid key.<br />
In the caves there is a Iskar wearing a gold outfit that stares at me threatingnly. When I ask him about the Greenmist he tells me I should forget anything I know about the Greenmist. Is this going to be Argest? If so I can I still do the turn in with the hide trick or do I need to go work more on my faction. He is on the left side if that makes a difference.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the help this site has been a great help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Valkyria Grymreaper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Can anyone post an approx loc for this cave in FM? Can't seem to find it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nazgaull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Argest does wear the gold armor... <br />
<br />
It looks like Chain Gear, with gold trimming.<br />
<br />
If he is threatening, KOS in anyway, then yes you need to work on Faction, as I believe he is on Resident's faction which needs to be non-kos to get around in side Cabilis safely unless you want to waste your money on Potions all the time.<br />
<br />
I had &quot;thought&quot; that I had a picture of him, but I guess I was mistaken.  I never uploaded the picture to my Server, so it is still on my hard-drive at home.<br />
<br />
I will try to remember to post it when I get home tonight.<br />
<br />
Can anyone post an approx loc for this cave in FM? Can't seem to find it.<br />
Location B on EQAtlas Map <br />
<br />
http://www.eqatlas.com/kunark/frontiermtnsmap.html<br />
<br />
It used to be a Burynai cave, goblins live there now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kowl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I finally got the stone key today. I am still KOS to Argest so I stood as far back as I could, hit hide, conned to make sure I was indifferent and did turn in. Got the dagger and went and did the combine in Droga and the turn in to Arch Duke Xog in East Cabilis. I am now the proud owner of a Lord of Pain Khurki.<br />
<br />
Valkyria, Argest does wear gold and you wont miss him when he spawns because he stands out from the other slaves. <br />
<br />
All I have left now is the greenish metal shard and the mirror, which I both expect to be a bitch and then I will have my Greenmist. Can't wait.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ashrai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Kowl, I had thought those would be the holdup for me as well but in fact I got both within a day of each other. Couple angles to work:<br />
<br />
Make friends with someone wanting the Urn off Drusella. I was sitting in zone with my Druid and my SK wondering how on earth I was going to duo her when in zoned another Druid who was tracking for a monk friend. They were perfectly happy to let me loot the mirror if it dropped in exchange for some extra help on Drus. Luckily both dropped.<br />
<br />
For the shard- find a Bard doing the halfling mask (or who has just completed one). They usually end up walking out of that Quest with one of those and either may let it go cheap or just give it to you. If your server forums have class forums, keep an eye on the Bard ones, they sometimes discuss the quest there and you can get an idea of who is working on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kowl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Thanks for the advise Ashrai. I will check in my guild and see if there are any monks or bards doing this. Of course it will have to wait a couple of days due to the fact that my guild is raiding POA this weekend and I camped Kowl on the 4th island last night so I am stuck with an alt for now.</div></div><hr />
