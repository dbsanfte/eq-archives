<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Justjoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">at 61, i had SCF1, IHT, and unholy touch1 (also using a war crested ring for ID4).  my max ht was 4507, possibly with a bard, but i dont recall.  since GoD, i haven't landed a HT for over 4200, and the rest have been between 2800 and 3400.  i just hit 62 last night, and my first HT was 4228.<br />
<br />
any one else notice a decline in thier damage?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Justjoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i spoke to a few of my SK friends on zeb, seems others are noticing they aren't critting for high damage as often as before the patch either.<br />
<br />
stealth nerf?<br />
<br />
am i wrong in thinking that IHT/unholy aura/unholy touch combined were suppose to give you 100% ht damage every time all the time?</div></div><hr />
