<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>aress</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">well, I use delta UI, and have a pet window popping up that contains all usual pet commands, except pet hold.  Is there any way I could replace once of those standard commands with /pet hold?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I can't help you with the UI part, but one generally doesn't want to be using /pet hold without /pet back off.  That means that even if it was workable to do as you desire to get the /pet hold command added to your pet window UI, it means pressing 2 buttons.  It would be easier to just create a hotbutton macro I think.<br />
<br />
I was about to press the post button, but thought I should expand a bit on it first...<br />
<br />
/pet hold does NOT clear the pet's hate list, it merely makes the pet stop attacking and return to it's guard spot or to following you around, etc.  This sounds acceptable, but there are often circumstances where that isn't enough.  The mob(s) are still on the pet's hate list.  It can be particularly surprising when you are fighting non-kos mobs but applies to kos mobs too.<br />
<br />
Let's say you are fighting for xp in the Plane of Storms.  You pull a scorpion and a snake adds.  So before you get to the group, you flop.  You see Jabobner start to rocket out to help, so you hit /pet hold and he strolls back.  You flop 'n drop a few times until the scorpion comes single and the snake has forgotten about you.  So you stand and bring back the scorpion to your group, you hit /pet attack since Jabobner is just standing there awaiting your commands, and proceed to dispatch the scorpion.  All is well.<br />
<br />
Now you go out and pull a cactus and bring it back to your group.  You, your pet and your groupmates are fighting the cactus when.... suddenly Jabobner dashes out and starts attacking a snake... a rock storm adds and so does another scorpion.  Jabobner kicks the bucket in seconds, and you now have three adds.<br />
<br />
Why did this happen?  Because /pet hold does not clear the pet's hate list.  Even though you were no longer on the snake's hate list (because you memblurred it via FD), the snake was still on the pet's hate list.  Even while you fought the scorpion and the cactus, the pet still had the snake on it's hate list.  So when the snake happened to stroll by, er... I mean slither by, at a bad time, Jabobner charged out to engage.<br />
<br />
/pet hold -- tells the pet to stop attacking and return to what it was doing, even if it or you are being hit.<br />
<br />
/pet back off -- clears the pet's hate list.  It will stop attacking only if it or you are not being hit.<br />
<br />
Using both commands, in that order (hold, then back off) in a 2 line hotbutton macro prevents most surprises of this sort.<br />
<br />
I also use /pet back off and /pet attack in a single hotbutton macro too.  This ensures the pet's hate list is completely clear before sending the pet at your desired target.  It also prevents a possible unexpected surprise if you got hit after you told the pet to hold and back off (thereby starting a NEW hate list on the pet) and later sent it in to attack, and possibly attacking the wrong one (say on a target switch on an unmezzable).<br />
<br />
Yah yah, too much information.  Klotar should have just read the post, decided he couldn't help, and moved on to the next one.  ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you sure you dont mean. That you dont want to use /pet attack without a /pet back off before it? Seems like you would want to clear aggro before releasing it. At least thats what I do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Actually, you caught me a bit there, Rhumba.  I use 3 lines (/pet hold, /pet back off, and /pet hold again).  Didn't want to admit to spam publically. ;)<br />
<br />
You're right, if one is going to use 2 lines, the /pet hold as last is better... providing you use a 2-line attack one too (I do mention that near the end 'tho).<br />
<br />
Edit: light bulb comes on!  I think I see what you mean now... pet should never attack once held; therefore there is no concern for the hate list until time to attack.  There was a reason for the extra line but now I sure the heck can't see it.  Time to find the old thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Saveaux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The macro I use for pulling:<br />
<br />
/pet hold<br />
/pet back off<br />
/pet follow<br />
/pet follow<br />
/pet follow<br />
<br />
Works great...</div></div><hr />
