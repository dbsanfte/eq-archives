<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Yabyab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am a 5500hp unbuffed SK with all Defensive AAs.. I was told that GoD is hard for SKs, so am asking if its possible for me to tank effectively in GoD with this HP?.. my AC is 1350ish unbuffed.. can reach 1600ish with AoP + buff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That depends where you want to tank. Vxed would be hard, in Tipt the bosses would own you. From what I've seen so far from the sewer trials, you should be able to do most of them; I can't say for trial 4, as I haven't been there yet (yay Smith Rondo!). KT would be a cakewalk for you except for named, because I can tank in KT with only one cleric, and they only need to use CH, at 4.5k hp and 1200 AC unbuffed. Yxxta is slightly harder from what I hear, and the Ikkinz trials would probably eat you alive, but for XP, you should be able to tank quite fine, with a competant group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Oberyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">...most bosses would get pretty nasty.  A competent group is key.  Slows need to be fairly early, and healer(s) need to pay attention.  On the nastier mobs luck plays a part too.   Got a quad the other day from a Barindu mob that procced 620 damage on all 4 hits, in addition to the melee dmg.  Hps drop and climb REAL fast, heheh.<br />
<br />
Most of the early stuff, you can tank.  Once you get upwards of the sewer trials, it starts getting spookier.  Fun though:)<br />
<br />
I'm sitting about at yours and Naelyan's level of HPs and AC as well.  LDoN and bazaar gear, and a few GoD toys now.  All defensives, etc...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Menon Lifeblight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The named at the end of sewer #1 would be tough.  Vxed and Tipt named are out of the question.  You can tank everything in sewer 1 right up until the end, and you can tank everything in sewer 2-4.<br />
<br />
You can be successful in GoD if you put the right group together.  You'll either need to be the puller, and bring a warrior to tank, or you can bring a ranger for WS tanking on named and a chanter to charm pets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Simu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">3 days spent in sewers now and I am sitting at the same HP point you are. All of the sewers are easy if you got a good group settings. <br />
<br />
Have a sleepy cleric on a bad pull and your toasted =)<br />
<br />
I still have to try the trials version of those Sewers things but it looks like doable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Based on recommendations here, we decided to give Vxed and Tipt a try and give a shot at trying to flag ourselves for KT.  Well, we managed to flag for Vxed the night before, so we thought we'd try Tipt last night.<br />
<br />
Well, we made it past the first mini-event thing and then while taking a med break I decided to tab out and read up a bit.  Well, I read that the boss hits for like 2200 and stuff -- a LEETLE beyond our/my capabilities.  Will have to study that a bit and decide how to tackle that (besides the patented dirt nap method).  We do have several WS rangers and TD chanters... looks like I will have to step aside for them this time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Yabyab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">thnks guys that was really helpful<br />
<br />
 anyone know the named girl that drops the +100hp ring, where does she spawn (which zone) and if I am able to tank her in a decent group?</div></div><hr />
