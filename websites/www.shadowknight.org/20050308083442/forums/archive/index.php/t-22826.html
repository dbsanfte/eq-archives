<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kastizi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Sienn said to collect 3 items to make a sheath for the new weapon....<br />
<br />
1. Gather a dark hide of a creature unmatched in its bleakness<br />
<br />
 No idea on that one... my guess, some mob in OoW somewhere.<br />
<br />
2. A holy lock of hair from a fair creature unmatched in happiness<br />
<br />
The chimera in WoS drops hair.... maybe this is what is needed?<br />
<br />
3. A gem possessing the very essence of fear itself, held by a creature more fearsome<br />
<br />
My guess is a new mob is in Plane of Fear.  <br />
<br />
Anyone else have any ideas?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Guglug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">a HOLY lock of hair   not a lock of hair.   chimera not sounds very holy sounds more liek sumden off a  high elf  paladin (or maybe a cleric)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Temet Nosce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">How far up is the new pegasus spawning?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Darkmourn D`Estrellas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">New pegasus in Sky is for shaman epic.<br />
<br />
My guess for the first part would be a nightmare hide, to be honest.  Obviously I could be wrong, but I can't think of much darker than that.<br />
<br />
No idea for 2nd one, but I agree it's got to be something obviously &quot;holy&quot; as in paladin, angel, saint, cleric, etc.<br />
<br />
Maybe similar to the essence of hate, an essence of fear might drop off of various golems or new mobs in Fear?  Not sure about Vermiculated Guardian though, just because vermiculated is druid armor, so it might be related to their epic.<br />
<br />
Just ideas, keep up the good work everyone :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">That sounds right.. pegasus in sky, vermiculated guardian (or cazic thule) in fear....but wait!!!<br />
<br />
Holy Lock of Hair from a creature unmatched in happiness... betcha Xegony drops hair now.  Sun-shiny rainbows, fairy queen... just make sure ya get the hair from the top o' her head an' not from down under.<br />
<br />
Fearsome Creature = Cazic Thule.  These are epic.. that means most likely they will put the drops on godz, no reason not to IMHO.... but... maybe not.<br />
<br />
Creature unmatched in blackness == that shadowman graphic from LDON.  Maybe a named shadowman in LDON hard raid? or LDON raid? or LDON adventure?<br />
<br />
-Bolas</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Neshaden BloodGut</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Oh dear god, if I have to go up into that Plane of Fear again, i'm going to go insane.  Out of every zone in the game, that has to be my least favorite.  Oh, the memories.. *shudders*<br />
<br />
But I have to agree with Darkmourn.  Nightmare's sound like the mob for that piece.<br />
<br />
No idea about number two, but my first thoughts were 'high elf' or Tunare, which I have doubts for.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure about the last piece either, but I think there was a new mob in the Temple of Cazic Thule.  Might want to look into that possibly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Okami</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I find it hard to believe epic 1.5 drops would be on gods though. I thought 1.5 was supposed to be single groupable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Chania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Thing is, Epic 1.5 is supposed to be mostly 1 groupable. Last I checked, Xeg and CT weren't exactly a walk in the park for 1 group. Maybe CT, but certainly not Xegony. I was thinking one of the death touching Golems myself, not CT.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT And Okami beats me to the punch...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lol figured id look it up... maybe its a bad idea considering the Horse and the Rider are kinda 1 mob but... maybe the death horsemen looking things in Plane of Nightemare B? i know they are undead but ... arent the mobs in Plane of Hate undead as well and they still drop a hide /shrug just a thought<br />
<br />
and as for fear ... its pretty much saying you need Essence of Fear... where does Essence of Hate drop from? Hate. Where does Essence of Chardok drop from? Chardok. Essence of Charasis? Charasis... i see a trend ... but in the SK channel someone was saying that was too obvious to be right ... theres no WAY it could drop from plane of Fear.... and yet ... the hint for the murkglider breeder is &quot;a breeding murkglider&quot; thats kinda obvious isnt it? oh well ... just my 2cp gonna try looking at some things... ill let you know what i find<br />
<br />
and had a thought after i posted ... the first definition ... little to no hope... Swamp of no Hope.... arnt there mobs there that are black sperms? maybe a new named spawns in the caves...again just another thought  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>ShadowRaptor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">im not sure if its new or not but ... <br />

also <br />
<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=6206<br />
<br />
highly doubt this one as its level 20<br />
and the people are saying it no longer spawns so /shrug<br />
<br />
and i dont think its a nightmare hide because the same hide drops from a lesser nightmare in lavastorm level 20 mob</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dark hide: since the epic mobs can be mostly anywhere, I'm leaning towards the dark side of Luclin, i.e. UP, AR, ME. Can't think of anything darker then that.<br />
<br />
Holy hair: I'm thinking some sort of unicorn. So, perhaps PoG, WL, or even the Faydarks.<br />
<br />
Fearsome gem: PoF is the obvious answer,maybe too obvious. Can't be CT himself I don't think since he was originally involved in the first epic. Perhaps dracholich. Gonna check out Temple of CT as well.<br />
<br />
Will report back with anything of course.</div></div><hr />

I couldnt pull the nightmares off the platform from below it.  (Used to be able to)  I decided to make a suicide run to the area through the caves...<br />
I make it.<br />
<br />
FD'd for a few, lost aggro, proceeded to kill the nightmares... I noticed something wierd.... they are missing thier little rams horns helmets they always wear.   Thought nothing of it, kept killing.  Eventually, I killed the 4 spawns of them.  Nothing dropped...<br />
<br />
20 mins passed.... no repop.....30 mins... still no repop....<br />
<br />
Can someone else confirm this hide from the nightmares please in pon?  And perhaps a repop time?   <br />

In Torgiran Mines &quot;The Fanatical Dwarf Zealot&quot; sorta fits the bill, (they are a paladin) but &quot;fair creature&quot; might be referring to a woman, or a non-human(oid?)... the happiness part is still tossing me.<br />

I'd like to say the pattern is one of old mobs with new drops, but dunno for sure.<br />

Is the happiness in context of their name, or is it more subtle - religion/deity?<br />
