<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Simu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hmm,<br />
<br />
I am the single FDer in my guild. Would you think some pet pulling is possible to single VZ copies ??<br />
<br />
Will the pet survive ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Makkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I heard the real VZ runs slightly faster than his copies, but I'm not sure from direct knowledge, we just tank them all they don't hit all that hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Simu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">12 to 18 ppl have an hard time tanking all the 5 at once.<br />
<br />
But thanks =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Never tried pet pulling but the best way to pull them is to pretarget one tank on each one and pull them all.<br />
<br />
Make sure each group has a healer and that the raid is in the corner so when respawns occur they don't aggro them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lynxal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You don't even have a necro to FD?<br />
<br />
They don't hit that hard individually....maybe with a fully buffed pet you could do it.  You could eventually get pet pull to work for you even if you lose every other pet I suppose.<br />
<br />
It's a big room though.....I am sure you can come up with a different way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>cames</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I hate to say it but you won't get very far in PoP with 18 folks in a raid.  So, asking how to do the encounter with a raid that small is interesting but not very useful (unless you are in a Time guild and want to see if you can do the encounter that way).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>DConquest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">They are snareable you know....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Simu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I Know they are snarable, even if they tend to campcorpse the FDer. I was just wondering if they were pet pullable ;) I just slapped my head for not having thought to pet pull them and was wondering if our pet does have enough hp to make it or not ?<br />
<br />
We know we won't go far in PoP with 18ppl, that's it, but VZ is definetly doable for us and is a nice source of upgrades =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>DConquest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I never tried the pet pull method on VZ, but if you buff / HoT / mage gear equip the pet before the pull then it should work imo.  I used to pull named out of packed rooms on LDoN Hards using the same method, and they have more DPS than any of the VZs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Duck_72</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have taken VZ down with 12 people and with me pet pulling...with an SK pet pulling you can single group him. He is so easyily 1 groupable its not funny...the`VZs cannot kill my pet when Virtued/Pet weaps, single target shrew, BSS, and shaman buffed...<br />
<br />
So in a one word answer YES he can be pet pulled.</div></div><hr />

heh why thank you, i may have to try this next time ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Maicom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">i read somewhere here that you can use the cleric targetable DA on your pet prior to a pet pull and it will still get agro on the mob you tell it to attack, but cause of DA the mob won't be able to hit back... never tried it myself but might wanna give that a go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Droogan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Pet pull works fine.. from first to pull to loot is 25 minutes for my group of 6-12 people.  Indoor shrew is your friend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Duck_72</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Aye but group shrew will not hit on your pet unless you spend the 20 aa`s...all the rangers and shammys I group with have single target shrew since I begged them to purchase it...make sure someone spends the 20 or so ap`s to get it on your raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Simu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">OK Duck,<br />
<br />
Thanks I'll try that =)</div></div><hr />
