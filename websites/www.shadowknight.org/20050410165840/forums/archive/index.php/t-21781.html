<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mehatesu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, this is a new topic for me and Im a bit confused.  When does riposte effect you the most?  While using 1 hand slash or 2 hand slash?  My main is a shaman and Ive never had to worry about this but my SK is starting to get up there in levels and I was healing a big &quot;to do&quot; about it and thought Id bring it up..Thanks for the help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The faster the weapon, the more you'll get riposted, but it's not as big a deal as people make it out to be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dakkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">People who parse a lot say ripostes are a small proportion of incoming damage from mobs while tanking.<br />
<br />
Basic rule is avoid it anywhere you don't want to give the mob a chance to get the occasional free hit on you.<br />
<br />
So when tanking heavy hitting named you're not sure you can survive, you might turn attack off and use spell aggro only.  And when raiding heavy hitters, avoid the front of the mob so you don't pick up the odd 2K riposte and create a nuisance for your group healer.<br />
<br />
Oh and 1 handers are supposed to be worse for ripostes than 2 handers like Slein says.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There are times I forget to turn off attack when the mob goes into riposte mode, but whether I'm using a one hander or a two hander doesn't seem to matter much since generally our weapons are slow.  However, a dual wielding class (including pets) can be affected greatly and lose hp quickly.<br />
<br />
Side note, when I think my group isn't too alert or are chatting a lot, what I do when the mob enrages is back up.  The mob follows me and the pets end up behind the mob... and the dual wielders go out of melee range.</div></div><hr />

its only going to be an issue where something will riposte for enough damage to kill you. people will want to use 2handers or tank just via spell aggro to avoid one badly timed riposte that kills them before they can get healed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Klotar, the appropriate action to that in that situation is to turn the enraged mob to face the duel wielders</div></div><hr />

I love you and hate you at the same time here. Sometimes I turn around and talk to my wife while playing my mage. If a mob enrages while I'm not paying attention, my pet will be dead in nothing flat (my main is a mage). If a mob is drug away right before it enrages and it's back is to my pet, Jober lives. :)<br />
<br />
When I am paying attention (being the gnomish hypocrite that I am), all those lazy ass dumbshits that still haven't figured out what enrage is (at 65th level with 2 aa's) get sent through a blender. After explaining what enrage is 20 different time, 20 different ways, to a raiding newb - it gets frustrating as all bloody hell. Sometimes death by enrage is the only way to get things through their skull. :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mehatesu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My main is a shaman, and Ive seen mobs get enraged, but never had to deal with the consequences of a mob going postal..Usually if they come my way Ive allready malo'ed them and park em with a quick emobilize..My question is around when do the mobs enrage, and does it mulitply theyre damage that severly?..I have yet to meet one with my sk, being only lvl 43 he is up and comming, I was just currious..thanks..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vengyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Mobs will Enrage when they reach low health (usually around 11% or under). It doesn't multiply the damage they deal, what actually happens is that the mob gets an automatic riposte on all attacks that hit him from the front. Basically, against any mob that Enrages, you should stand behind it, and you will be safe. Be careful though if you choose to continue attacking from behind an Enraged mob, as the main tank will have switched attack off, so you might get aggro (though as SKs are not exactly a high DPS class, that's not something we have to worry about  :rolleyes: ) You'd be surprised how many level 65s still eat Enrage death on raids, even in Elementals....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">mobs that enrage do so when they hit 9% hp, so its not hard to plan accordingly. also, as was stated, enrage = auto riposte, and for those who didn't realize riposte = avoiding frontal hits AND swinging back in response to them. so... attacking a mob frontally when it is enraged is lazy and dumb. the only damage you do by attacking through enrage is with your damage shield, which generally isn't enough to justify the damage intake.</div></div><hr />

<br />
it gets to a point where a class like a rogue etc, can get one rounded if an enraged mob turns. simply because of how many times they strike in a  round vs. what the mob hits for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Mehatesu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Thanks for the input, I will definatly keep that in mind..thanks again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Daemoness</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I know on my Mage my nuke crits have wonderful timing for enrage. On many raids I have been responsible to critting the mobs in to enrage on many occasions, the best one was an AoW raid and the MT was waiting for it so he could flip the AoW. Anyway in the end there was a perfect arch of dead melee, I'll have to dig up the screen shots of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ashrai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I remember back when mobs in Umbral Plains would enrage and it was most players' first experience with it. At that point I played a Druid and it was very possible to &quot;force an enrage&quot; if all the nukers in the group let loose at the wrong time. They removed that and people got lazy again and everyone went back to hitting atk and going AFK.<br />
<br />
On raids you've got a shitload of DPS pumping out, you've got lag, you've got people shoved all around you preventing you from backing up. Good rule of thumb is to turn off attack earlier than 9%. My personal &quot;oh shit enrage&quot; % is usually about 12% or so, sometimes more depending on the mob and the level of DPS. That gives me enough time to turn off attack and back up out of melee range. Doing this a bit early also affords you a wonderful ringside seat from which to laugh at those who got chewed to death in seconds.<br />
<br />
When enrage gets close, you have a lot of people stopping what they are doing and backing off. This raises the chance that you're going to be the one getting a face full of rage, and the chance the mob will turn if the MA loses agro completely. Rogues *really* love when this happens and it's usually a good idea to not laugh at them when it does or you'll never get your corpse dragged again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">the mob does what the 61 or whatever shaman pet does. that help?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gordrach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I had my first experience with enrage very recently (48 Troll SK on Bert) and it wasn't pretty.  I was completely unaware, but luckily I was with my guild (Final Chapter) and our cleric was able to keep me alive.  Enrage and the riposte phenomenon were explained to me on the spot.  I will not be making the same mistake (though I did have the pleasure of watching a ranger get himself in that manner later in the evening).   :D</div></div><hr />
