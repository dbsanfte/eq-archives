<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ahlana DaFosse</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">With the prospect of Augmentations, perhaps the IC will be useable again with the right mods. I know I for one would love to pull it out of the bag simply because I think it is still the best looking sword in the game. Of course, other then the damage/delay ratio the other stats are not to shabby.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>yuggoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Up the damage 5 or 10, add some ac and hp, and it would be pretty competitive I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Auronan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Considering that you deleted your toon Ahlana, what &quot;bag&quot; do you plan on pulling it out of...?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lejina Bloodbath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Why would you augment IC instead of your better weapon?<br />
<br />
Lets say, you currently use a 52/46 weapon instead of you 40/45 IC.<br />
<br />
You get a 5dam augmentation regent.<br />
<br />
So you can now have either a 57/46 or a 45/45.<br />
<br />
Relatively, IC wouldnt be any better than it currently is.<br />
<br />
If you currently dont use your IC, to have these augmentation regents wont make it any more appealing with LDoN. Your other weapon will still remain a better option.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ahlana DaFosse</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well Auronan is right lol but it's the concept hun :p ...  and as far as why you would do it to IC .. well I always liked it better then anyother sword.. If you could make it better and use it day to day I think that quite a few would.. just my opinion.. also as far as I have seen you won't be able to augment alot of the luclin and PoP weapons.. these augements are to bring back some oldies</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ueuelr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I guess we'll have to wait and see what we can and can't augument, and by how much. <br />
<br />
EG if epic weapons and truly epic they would have something like 5 or 10 augument slots as opposed to other weapoms which might only have 1 to 3 slots. Also there are different type of augument slots, so epic weapons may be able to use augument types not available to other weapons.<br />
<br />
We'll just ahev to wait and see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Elkar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">From the new screenshots on Alla's, it looks like only items that allow augmentation (i.e. new items from LDoN?) can be improved.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>yuggoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">To augment a better weapon than IC presumes that you *have* a better weapon than IC.... but then I am gimp, have always been gimp, and likely always will be gimp :b</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ahlana DaFosse</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Aye, will just have to wait and see. I know Alla shows some of the LDoN augments but on the LDoN site it mentions being able to Augment older equipment. But as I don't play anymore someone will have to tell me, just because I'm nosey like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Morgrist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Older gear will indeed get augment slots.<br />
 <br />
I'm hoping the Curse (and Greenmist,and other epic gear) get an exceptional number of slots compared to other things.<br />
 <br />
I want my IC to kick butt as long as I do,wouldn't you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Apokx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">What's cool for me is that the IC is currently my best weapon.<br />
So augmenting it will be fun.<br />
<br />
<br />
Unless like Elkar posted,that only LDoN items can have augs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">According to the LDoN sight, &quot;everyone has a favorite trinket sitting in the bank they'd love to be able to use again &amp; with LDoN augments, this will be possible!&quot; or some shit along those lines.  <br />
<br />
I also seem to remember seeing somethign from a player in LDoN beta (likely breaking the NDA) stating that epics had like 6 augment slots, where as most other stuff had 3 (or something like that - epics had an advantage there though... don't remember the details, I was tired &amp; depressed IRL).  <br />
<br />
Would certainly be nice, IC has always had a certain mystique about it, but some of that may be lost if everyone brings them out of retirement... have to wait and see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shintou Shinai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Like Apox, IC is my best weapon. I like Questing and I got really lucky in getting it.<br />
<br />
and I hate farming anything, espically pp.. and I probably won't see much of PoP cept for Tier 1 so.. IC .<br />
<br />
So heres for hoping that their are augmentation slots for it.. Up the Damage lower the Delay.. If I could get it reversed.. 45/40...<br />
<br />
That in itself would be great. But I'll take what I can get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Xanon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I`d love to be able to augment my IC, I just recently got it about a month ago and I just use it to show off and such in my off time (when I`m not living in my home aka BoT).  I`d love to be able to use it again as a viable weapon and throw out my green ball stick.  Add more HPs on it, get some sta on the sucker, raise damage or lower the delay, maybe add a lil extra mana onto it, it`ll be one mean mofo, not to mention the proc rate on the sucker is outstanding.<br />
<br />
But one thing is for sure, even now, it`s not sitting in my bank, rotting; it`s always in my inventory where I can see it :)</div></div><hr />
