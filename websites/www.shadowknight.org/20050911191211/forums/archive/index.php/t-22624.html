<br />
We tried with cornering a mite downwater on the left corner when you go in, just to wipe... Casters couldn't land a spell with water issues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oberyn</div><div class="date">09-06-2004, 04:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">...did it on the back ledge, pulling the mites up and fighting them there.<br />
<br />
Its a pain in the ass, and works better if everyone is shrunk.<br />
<br />
But it is nice, not to have to deal with the water, if you have people who are hydro-phobic.<br />
<br />
An Aside:  this is a very annoying place to fight if you have a tank who tends to forget about mob positioning periodically.  If they have their shit together, its fine.  People just need to be on the ball.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Silku</div><div class="date">09-06-2004, 03:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a pillar type support leading up to a drianage pipe on the left hand side of the room.  You can run up this pillar, then jump on to the top of that pipe.  From there, you can run and jump on to a ledge, that leads all the way around the room.  If you position your cleric/support team here, and then position yourself further towards the back of the room you are able to pull the ancients up out of the water on tothe ledge with you.  This should be a ranged only fight unless you have plenty of healing power and your group is able to take an AE rampage fight.   <br />
<br />
Pull with something high aggro like Asystole or a few chain CDs in order to let slow hit early, and you'll be fine.   The funny thing abou this particular encounter is if you are in the water with the mites you will not be able to cast on them.  So you must be out of water to cast on them.  This ledge is the only way weve ever been able to succesfully do it, and seems to be a widely used tactic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eclipsia</div><div class="date">09-06-2004, 08:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just my opinion but have the MT stand in the right hand side niche on the stairs and casters/healers in the left side niche. The MT can tag the mites sequentially. The only issue is the Noc roamer that sometimes spawns and roams the corridor outside. In my experience if you kill 5 aged then wait for him to respawn he wont rain on your parade. Some people prefer to levi climb onto the ledge that rims the room, and even camp casters in the half-pipes. Fighting them in the water is definately a bad idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brael</div><div class="date">09-06-2004, 09:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just lev over the water, who needs a ledge</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Simu</div><div class="date">09-08-2004, 04:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Used the ledge and that was not that messy.<br />
<br />
I was up to levitate over water but the casters complained there spells weren't landing... After few kicks in the balls they admitted being some kind of Ouzbeks genetics wastes and stopped bitching.<br />
<br />
But I tanked on the ledge for the peace of my mind... mobs warped perfectly on me.</div></div><hr />

Dont know if anyones had this before but when we first got there we only counted 8 Aged Mites. It was only when we pulled &quot;one&quot; that we found one was actually 2. That sure did throw a spanner in the works.</div></div><hr />
