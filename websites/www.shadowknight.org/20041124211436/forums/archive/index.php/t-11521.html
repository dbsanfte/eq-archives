<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Been using this quite a bit, playing with it by casting on people besides the tank (wizards, rogues, monks, druids, clerics, etc) and noticed something, this is next to useless, in order to be any help at all your main tank needs to not be generating enough hate to begin with, for VoTerris to be effective at keeping aggro on a tank your tank needs to be doing ~91-104% (slightly over needed to account for melee damage spikes) of the aggro which is needed.  With VoThule your tank needs to be doing ~89-104% of the needed aggro for it to make a difference.<br />
<br />
Lets say a warrior is generating 40 hate/sec through melee, and dual enraging blow weapons is giving him an additional 50 hate/sec, that means 90 hate/sec, throw VoTerris on him and its 100 hate/sec, VoThule and its 102 hate/sec, thats a very small upgrade, this line could be so much better.<br />
<br />
A few ideas I thought of tonight which could improve it:<br />
1. Decrease recycle on VoThule, this would be the least helpful upgrade but currently there is nothing to distinguish it from VoTerris, a 5 minute recycle or so would make it an actual upgrade assuming the spell kept its duration.<br />
<br />
2. Revamp the hate modifier values on the voice line and change them to give 5/10/15/25% hate.  This change on its own would also be fairly ineffective only helping on intial aggro a bit (see above for me explaining the current problem) however combined with change #3 I think it would be a good change.<br />
<br />
3. Make the voice line give a bonus to taunts chance of success equal to the amount of extra hate it gives (5/10/15/25%), perhaps also increasing the recycle on taunt to balance it out some, this wouldnt be a huge increase to sustaining aggro but that isnt where the problem is, this would help with getting aggro initially</div></div><hr />

<br />
I thought the same thing about recast time on VoThule last night too.  Only just got the spell and I didnt really feel like it was doing anything better than VoTerris...<br />
<br />
Would be good to see the taunt bonus too.  Wouldnt mind seeing a small stat or atk boost or something on it too, but not enough to get monks and rogues asking for it.</div></div><hr />
