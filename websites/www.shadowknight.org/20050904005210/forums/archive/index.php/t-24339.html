I tanked there for the first time yesterday at lv 55 for several hours (ww shammy was pullin with slow) when it came time to leave I found a lv 61 warrior to replace me in group.  In about 10 min I got a tell from the shammy beggin me to come back because the warrior couldn't hold aggro!  Nice since he was six levels higher.<br />
<br />
I was using clinging on inc, then terror line, then fear, every few sec would recast terror and fear.  Didn't lose aggro for several hours.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the &quot;How-to's&quot; from all the previous posters :D</div></div><hr />

I personally would just de-mem your hate spell, it's useless.  Fear creates more aggro.  Secondly, instead of chaining fear every so often; just use clinging darkness.  20 less mana, and has a much faster casting time and is by far superior in aggro; adds aggro even if a more potent snare is on a mob.  If you want the extra umph of aggro, chain both since Clinging has a recast, otherwise I have never had a problem just casting clinging darkness threwout the fight.  I only use the 67 hate spell, which is by far superior to any aggro based spell, on incoming mobs.  Clinging is superior in mana vs hate added.</div></div><hr />

I've always held agro with fear far better then CD.  Also, I still use fear over the 67 terror spell.  Fear seems to generate more agro overall, but the 67 terror spell generates better &quot;snap&quot; agro (on raid mobs and in groups with agro whores I'll mem both).</div></div><hr />

This is just a self study based on having, like I said, a shaman use slow in Wall of Slaughter and run past me and I would use each spell, (67 hate, Clinging darkness, 61 festering darkness, 59 terror of terris (510 hate), Fear.)<br />
Of the experience, and Only using her slow<br />
<br />
67 hate would rip the mob off her and run right at me.<br />
     -60mana 1.5 casting time<br />
<br />
Clinging Darkness would make the mob turn to me as she passed<br />
     -20mana 1.75 casting time<br />
<br />
Festering darkness, same as clinging<br />
<br />
59 terror of terris made me cast twice before the mob would run turn his attention to me<br />
     -51mana 1.5 casting time<br />
<br />
Fear made me cast twice to get noticed<br />
    -40mana 3.5 casting time<br />
<br />
that took two hours of just testing to check.  Tried other ways, like having her use two slows.  than would use only one of those spells that I mentioned to see how long it would take to get the mob to get off her and run at me.  I just found that discord is the single greatest spell for initial aggro.  Darkness has been the top second for creating the highest amount of aggro, along with it is the cheapest as well.  Fear and any other hate is obsolete to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">window</div><div class="date">02-26-2005, 07:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">terror of discord is definitely the most hate.<br />
<br />
personally i've stuck with clinging for agro generation, but i keep dread gaze memmed for situational use, or ToD if there's no chance of adds.<br />
<br />
i prefer clinging because:<br />
1.2 sec cast time with affliction haste 1<br />
no fizzles ever<br />
more agro/mana<br />
the minor snare is useful</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Culdahl1</div><div class="date">02-26-2005, 10:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Time festering so it lands just as the mob gets to you and you will pull agro from anyone, period....after that, cast your AC tap and bite then cast fear.  I may cast fear one or two more times during a given fight depending on how long it lasts, but that combination will hold agro from anyone (even retarded BL's that like to slow, DoT and debuff all whilst meleeing &lt;sigh&gt;)<br />
<br />
It's snap aggro because it greates that much more aggro. <br />
<br />
It puts you at the top of the hate list (top + 1 or something like that), but when you're already at the top of the list it doesn't seem to &quot;build&quot; further agro like fear does...the terror spell is also great for breaking mezz, so I tend to keep it mem'd if there's a chanter in group.<br />
<br />
I guess it's a personal preference really...I've heard some say CD &gt; fear and vice-versa but, in my experience, fear has been far superior in maintaining agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KlowdKill</div><div class="date">02-26-2005, 11:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You have a lot of facts to work out culd.  Hate spells add x amount of hate.  For instance, the 57's adds 600 + 500, on two seperate accounts.  Giving you a Solid 1100 increase in hate.<br />

What you just explained in the first line of puts you on top + 1 was the Taunt button.  To school on this, if a enchanter is playing with an add he's going to be gaining alot of aggro.  I would never cast a spell on a mez'd mob until my taunt works, but THAN I will be on top of aggro+1, than cast my terror of discord to be on top of aggro+1 + 1,100 more additional hate.  Nifty indeed.<br />
<br />
But Klowd, why not cast before taunt?  Well, ToDiscord &gt; a single mez.  But, if the enchanters been slowing &amp; crippling etc. you're wasting mana.<br />
<br />
Let's say player enchanter01 creates 15,000 pts of aggro, you would have to cast Terror of Discord approximitly 15 times just to break the mez.  Where as, you could wait first where taunt works, be at the 15,001 aggro Than do ToDiscord to be at 16,101!  You are teh win!<br />
<br />
If you want to be fancier, I actually stop attacking my current mob, and cast terror of discord on the additional mezed mob about 3 times during the course of the current fight, which case soon as first mob is dead, I can instantly wake the next w/ complete aggro.  Go me!<br />
<br />
Fear and Clinging darkness are very close in the amount of aggro they produce, i'm staying firm that CD is still superior due to self testing, and the snare portion surpases the purpose of having fear memed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">window</div><div class="date">02-26-2005, 11:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">terror of discord is 1800 hate. the hate it produces isn't subject to caps which is why it is in the unknown161 field of lucy, rather than the expected base1 that lucy reads on its description of the effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KlowdKill</div><div class="date">02-26-2005, 11:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">About two months ago Allakahzam had it listed as <br />
1: Increase Hate by 500<br />
2: Increase hate by 600 <br />
where as lucy still included its description as increase hate by 1.  Was changed on alla, but the thread states it as being a total of 1200, but since alla's forums are by far the worst place to gather exact information I won't argue your 1800 using them as a fact.<br />
<br />
But, it being 1800 would help my theory that Clinging Darkness adds roughly 800 hate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slein Jinn</div><div class="date">02-27-2005, 01:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One Terror of Discord is roughly 1.7 or 1.8 Clinging Darknesses.  It is the most potent aggro spell we have, and also the most consistent (nothing else, from mob type to SCS AA's affects it).  Clinging darkness is slightly more mana effecient, however.  Fear's aggro depends somewhat on the target, but it is a less potent spell than either ToD or CD; the reason it was attractive in the past was aggro without a DoT component for tank mezzing.  It is no longer needed in this role, however, due to the superiority of ToD.  <br />
<br />
With ToD, you don't ever really need another aggro spell (Dread Gaze aside, but that's another monster entirely.) - ToD is the most potent and is usable in all situations.  CD is more efficient, and can be further improved by AA's and affliction haste, however, though neither spell is exactly taxing on mana, so the added efficiency isn't a big deal.  <br />
<br />
What nobody has mentioned are spear spells.  They're obviously all but worthless for sustained aggro, but spears are certainly useful for snap aggro.  They produce a decent amount of hate and with only a 0.5 second cast time can be quite useful when a mob turns on someone.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KlowdKill</div><div class="date">02-27-2005, 01:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Discussion was mostly referring to his sustating the aggro, I wasn't diving into how to get it back asap.  I personally don't have my spear spells up, granted I do not have the 900 pt spear either, but no FT, and using 64's lich I usually only stay 90's comfortably using CD over Discord.<br />
<br />
My circumstance is that we chain pull wos, we will always have 2 mobs in the camp without a bard or enchanter, so I tank two at a time consistanly without any form of break.  But i'm not there for dps, so i'm comfortable only dealing with keeping aggro.<br />
<br />
Was doing a raid on an AE dragon, used 350dd lifetap at the time.  Stole aggro after 4 casts.  Warrior was a gimp, but still seemed odd how much aggro it made, I never seen TotC or Shroud of Discord create aggro for being equal to the lifetap spell at the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Culdahl1</div><div class="date">02-27-2005, 02:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Say what you will, but if I cast fear 2-3 times I do not loose agro...if I cast ToD or CD 2-3 times I do &lt;shrug&gt;.  ToD seems to give me more snap agro when pulling a mob off of someone, but fear seems to build agro better over the course of the fight...no numbers to back this up or anything other then I've tried all three on countless occassions and fear is always the best option (had to use CD in LDoN's a lot and my agro sucked when compared to agro in BoT using fears).<br />
<br />
P.S. - I assumed ToD was top + 1 'cause it was described that way and seems to work that way, but if you have proof that it is a set amount of hate then I gues I'm wrong.....doesn't make sense that fear is generating more agro for me then ToD though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Bluff? WTF are you talking about?  I love when people tell me how my agro works....If CD works better for you then by all means use it, but CD doesn't come close to fear when I've used it.  Tanked tonight in WoS with a cleric pulling and shaman slowing on incoming and no one EVER got hit....not ONCE.  I FD'd on incoming (just as mob got to me so I was within melee range), cast AoP, inru bite, fear and maybe one other fear + spear towards end of fight.  If your way works better then a complete agro lock then more power to you.<br />
<br />
In regards to ToD - I'm not saying the spell isn't great...it can pull a mob off of anyone instantly with a single cast, but the spell allows me to loose agro during a fight more often then fear.  Both lucy and Alla still have the spell listed as increase hate by 1, which seems to be how the spell works...apparently you guys have parsed it or something to have a set number of +hate... I can't argue that 'cause I haven't parsed it (have no clue how one would actually), but 2x ToD = lost agro and 2X fear doesnt....fear wins IMO.<br />

I have only used ToD as my primary agro spell 4 times or so though, so perhaps I was just grouping with a bunch of retards that had no concept of agro management.....I will try it a few more times to give yall the benefit of the doubt, but my initial impression of the spell is that it's best for getting agro, but not keeping it.</div></div><hr />

I was never much for spears myself but another SK I know has pretty much the same playstyle as I do but he keeps a spear up. I never appreciated just how effective they can be until I was playing my twink chanter in WoS caves with him. I was sitting when a mob popped and before I could even say OW his spear had turned the mob to him faster than I could have done if I were on my SK.

With festering on incoming, terror and Ibite/ToP I don't loose aggro even from an end game necro in melee range (which to me is a BIG test of aggro)....with fear I had to cast more often when there was a good necro in the group or overzealous BL chain casting while doing melee.<br />

<br />
I've always kept my biggest spear mem'd for just that reason....with the slow recast time you can usually only get one shot off per fight, so I typically wait 'till the mob is under 50% to keep aggro or fire it off if the mob turns (which usually get it right back)....it's also good for when you break mezz (9 times out of 10 A mezz'd mob stays on me, but in the event that it doesn't a quick spear + terror/fear will do the trick).</div></div><hr />

The refresh time on ToD can be a pita in some places when you need to be quicker than usual. I keep up another agro spell on raids, and in groups I'll keep up ToD, Fear, and CD. Sometimes there's just something about the mobs where you get a feel they're reacting differently to certain spells, or you just notice one spell working better than the other so it's nice to switch around. Most times it's a combo of ToD and CD/Fest.</div></div><hr />

Aggro parsing is quite trivial actually.  Once you've figured out what various abilities add you get more and more skills to figure out more stuff easier.  If you want to read about how aggro parsing has progressed here (http://www.shadowknight.org/forums/showthread.php?t=18154)  Bit of a warning though it's a fairly long read including the theads linked in that one which are a good idea to read first for some background info.  13 total pages there with some others which you can find in the Arena forum here I believe, would just take a bit of searching through my posts to find them.  All together about 20 pages worth of info on how to find it out, with the end result being among other things such info as what you see in my post just above this.</div></div><hr />

My drog is only the 65k one not the 100k one so it is 55% speed vs 65% for the 100k vs 95% for the aa horse that you're going to help me figure out how to get at level 55.  I paid more for the hat than the horse why no comment there??<br />

Brael thanks a ton for that aggro post good info to know as I pick up those higher level spells.</div></div><hr />

Once you've figured out what various abilities add you get more and more skills to figure out more stuff easier.  If you want to read about how aggro parsing has progressed here (http://www.shadowknight.org/forums/showthread.php?t=18154)  Bit of a warning though it's a fairly long read including the theads linked in that one which are a good idea to read first for some background info.  13 total pages there with some others which you can find in the Arena forum here I believe, would just take a bit of searching through my posts to find them.  All together about 20 pages worth of info on how to find it out, with the end result being among other things such info as what you see in my post just above this.<br />

I think my initial impression of ToD was off because of a handful of bad groups and my impression that it was better for snap aggro was probably due to the initial aggro cap that you mentioned.  All in all, ToD does maintain aggro better, but a group full of retards can make any aggro spell feel gimped.<br />
<br />
As for fear vs. CD - I would still choose fear over CD if ToD didn't exist....even if both spells generated the exact same amount of hate on every mob (which is debateable), fear does not do damage and is better for situational CC in groups with chanters/bards  +  I cast festering on incoming for the hate over time effect and snare.<br />
<br />
P.S. - if the snare portion of the spell is resisted how much aggro is generated?  Seems there are a lot of mobs that resist snare often or are completely immune.</div></div><hr />

I've always assumed the same amount of agro was generated.<br />
Not had agro issues even if CD was resisted, immune, or did not take hold.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fear vs CD however is pretty debateable, theres benefits and drawbacks to each, espically once you consider Twinge of Pain 1.  CD is extremly fast and only a 4 second recycle (5.2 sec/1200 hate) resulting in about 13846 hate/min plus whatever the dot gives, lets say an extra 80 from that (70 crits/focus/damage rest for that bonus dot hate) so 13926/min for ~231 mana prior to mana pres or 60:1 ratio.  Pretty good isn't it?  Of course then you have Fear which is less aggro over time and twice the mana but is entirely non damage.  Basically which is better between them comes down to personal preference 95% of the time, though in some cases one is clearly better than the other depending on if you want to mez or if the mobs immune and you need more hate or whatever.</div></div><hr />
