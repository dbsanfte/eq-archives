<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Warmonster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I use my pet alot for LDoN and he does well on Normal LDoN, but he gets eaten up perty quickly on Hard LDoNs.  I might spend the points just to increase the pets life span some what on the hards.<br />
<br />
Other AA I am considering at this point are Intense Harted and Deaths Fury.<br />
<br />
I never really bought into Pet Hold, because I usually take him along on the pulls.  He has saved my butt many times keeping mobs busy until I could get successful FD off in the event of a over pull.<br />
<br />
My Magelo is up to date, so if you feel there is a AA I am missing that is an absolute must I am all ears.  But, please explain why I should be getting them over the above mentioned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You don't have to use that hold command if ypu have it, is the one thing I'd point out. Otherwise, I know that my guildmate who bought Pet Affinity likes how it added to the pet's overall durability-- NPCs have 30ish buff slots, so making more use of them if you have the pet up alot makes sense.<br />
<br />
Also, we'll get a new pet with the OoW expansion, and perhaps the Suspend Minion AA. It would end up being even more useful at that point to have the Pet Affinity AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">pet hold &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; pet affinity, considering the cost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>kassdax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">One thing to keep in mind about pet affinity and ldon's is most buffing classes get pissy if you ask them to rebuff when actually inside the dungeon. or at least it seems that way on Saryrn. After all, it's only a pet and not an actual player - right? If it were possible to make a pet outside the dungeon, have all the buffs hit Jobober, suspend him when you zone in then unsuspend it when you're inside that would be great - but the game doesn't work like that.<br />
<br />
How often do you get all your buffs just before entering the ldon? How often does your group get buffed after being in the ldon?<br />
<br />
From a raiding standpoint, pet affinity is HUGE!!! However, a lot of raiding guilds don't necessarily appreciate pets unless the owner has /pet hold.<br />
<br />
Something being tossed around on the mage boards would be a pet affinity 3 aa. Some people have asked that when a pet is made that the mage should be able to take all the buffs on them and give them to their pet. However, this is nothing more than a wish from the mages.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bashtaado</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I use my pet in hard ldons. Adds a little dps and is good for pulling busy rooms, but he does die very easily. I wouldnt consider pet affinity would be a help to me for ldon - as all the group buffing happens before I enter the dungeon and pet is created only when I have entered. <br />
Might be nice for raids/xp groups however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have Deaths Fury 5 and it essentially takes Jabobers max hit from 55 to 92. He was doing about 20'sh dps in PoEarth exp groups for example and a groupmate parsed him doing 27.5 dps the other day in the same typical scenario. <br />
<br />
5 AA levels for 15 pts spent is relatively cheap when you look at how most other AA abilities scale. I am glad I spent it and have my pet out in all my exp groups whenever possible. He adds free dps for only the cost of the occasional haste buff (now if only we got a pet buff that lasted longer then 17 min).<br />
<br />
I dont know the percentage scaling on pet crits with DF or what percent of hits he crits (I dont parse that much) but I dont regret buying it at all. It all adds up and since he is my main form of damage when soloing it helps out there as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Having /pet hold is one of those AA's that a lot of people underestimate, but it's extremely useful, from pet pulling to simply keeping your pet from getting killed/fucking something up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually I have all the GoD aa's and the only ones I have found to have much use have been Run 5, WA 5 ( pros and cons here), intense hatred and pet affinity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Warmonster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thank You, for all your comments, I think I will go with Deaths Fury first.  Then possibly Pet Affinity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Kassdax summed it up pretty good.<br />
<br />
I use the pet on LDoN's a lot; and although for those, Jabobner isn't likely to have Hand of Virtue or Fo7 on for the reasons stated above, he will still likely have some shorter duration buffs on that sometimes need to be refreshed partway, such as group DS's, Blessing of Replenishment, CoP, SoV, etc. plus whatever auras or torrents I might be using plus benefits from the ZB recourse heals.<br />
<br />
It's 20 points I don't regret spending, but whether it's a good buy for you or not depends I think on what other skills might be better for the points spent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rhumba_Kween</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'd be curious if others have seen a 7dps increase from Death's Fury. I don't have it yet, but that seems very, very high to me.<br />
<br />
I'd make a better assumption that the pet just had Haste when he was parsed at 27dps. My pet always parsed at 27-30dps with just Chanter haste. So does deaths Fury really add almost 40 percent dps to the pet?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Pet Affinity is one of my favorite AA's. Just the fact that Zevfeer's heals the pet and Aura of Hate boots it's attack makes it worth it. Go with that first, you won't be disappointed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Thank You, for all your comments, I think I will go with Deaths Fury first.  Then possibly Pet Affinity.<br />
<br />
Very, very shitty decision.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Excessium</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Thank You, for all your comments, I think I will go with Deaths Fury first.  Then possibly Pet Affinity.<br />
 <br />
Way to ask for advice then go with what you were going to &quot;go&quot; with anyway. <br />
<br />
Mostly everyone told you to go: Pet hold, Pet Affinty. Oh well. What SJ said.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">On the other hand, Pet Affinity just got a lot better than it was before.  Check the latest patch notes and see if you don't agree.  I think I'd put Pet Affinity before Death's Fury at this point, if you're dead set against getting Pet Discipline.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Zoning with pets just upped the value of pet affinity if you use your pet a lot</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Warmonster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">LOL!!!  I am sorry that a couple of you feel slighted that I decided to follow someone else's advice.  Cheer up though, maybe next time I will pick you.<br />
<br />
I may decide on Pet Affinity because zoning makes it more valueable now.  Prolly go PA then DF.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Rhumba_Kween</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">You should maybe look at the other thread on Death's Fury. It does not add 7dps as was said by Syfon, it adds about 1.6dps...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Yeah, we feel slighted when someone else does something dumb... good call.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Warmonster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">That is your opinion and you are most certainly entitled to it.  Just as I am entitled to ignore it and feel sorry for you.  However, look at the bright side, you seem to enjoy posting here and giving your opinion, so in the end I prolly made your day.<br />
<br />
You are welcome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I couldn't care less whether you want to make a good decision or a bad one - I simply pity your inability to make logical choices.  Deaths fury is one of the absolute worst AA's in the SK lineup, and you're putting it above one of the best, and another that's very valuable.  Even going by the clearly false &quot;test&quot; indicating it yields 7DPS, Death's Fury is inferior to Pet Discipline and Pet Affinity - your pet does no DPS if you can't use it and if it isn't alive... /pet hold is infinitely useful for pulling too, especially casters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Warmonster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">If you took the time to read these threads, you would see I am going with Pet Affinity first.  I saw the post on 7 DPS and understand Deaths Fury may not be all it was tooted.<br />
<br />
Also, on the subject of Pet Hold, I never said it was a bad choice, but due to my style of play it has very little value to me.<br />
<br />
You need to consider that not everyone on this board plays an SK the way you do.  So instead of saying someone is stupid or dumb for not following your advice, you might accept your advice is not universal for all SK's and move to another thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I do not have long arduous logs of data to show that DF added any dps whatsoever, I was just stating what my groupmate said he parsed my pet at. I have parsed my pet before and he never got more then 22 dps in extended duration fights and was usually closer to 20 (not sure of where others were parsing such high dps for him before). <br />
<br />
I simply wrote that I bought DF and that I was happy with the decision and did not regret it. Pet Affinity jus became a ton more valuable (i think) due to being able to zone with the pets now since those buffs will not be as &quot;wasted&quot; and need to be recast all the time.<br />
<br />
I got /Pet Hold long before ever considering DF and only bought the first few levels cause it was cheap to do so. If I were the average SK I would most likely take SJ's, Brael's, or Siilver's advice long before mine. The only intent of my post was to state what I had done since he asked what others opinions were. Of course it also depends on how valuable you feel min / maxing is and how hard AA's are to come by. 20 AA might only be a weekend of grinding for some while it might take weeks for others.<br />
<br />
The most important thing is choosing AA or anything else in EQ is to do what makes you happy and enjoy your time. If you spend your points where you want to and feel you are getting the returns you expected for those points spent then you cant go wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Ravenar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Perhaps I got lost at one point, but when did/will Pet affinity change to be able to zone with Goner?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Apparently the latest (or perhaps next?) patch is changing it so that all summoned pets can zone with their owner, including any gear or buffs that the pet has.  They even specifically mentioned height, which I thought was sort of strange.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Also, on the subject of Pet Hold, I never said it was a bad choice, but due to my style of play it has very little value to me. <br />
<br />
The only style of play for which &quot;it has very little value&quot; is not using your pet.  If you didn't use your pet, you wouldn't be starting this thread.  <br />
<br />
If you can't see the value of /pet hold, I pitty you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">They even specifically mentioned height, which I thought was sort of strange.<br />
<br />
probably because shrink isn't a buff, and most people shrink their pets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Warmonster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I use my pet all the time in EXP Groups and LDoN Groups, but apparently I use it differently than you.  Again, that is my choice so deal with it or let it go.  <br />
<br />
You will prolly post something witty after this, but I am not going to humor you with a reply.  <br />
<br />
You bore me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Toothfairy_TP</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">So much H8 in the air  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Excessium</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Didn't think it was possible for someone with 550+AA to be so fucking clueless about the benefits of /pethold.<br />
<br />
If you took the time to read these threads, you would see I am going with Pet Affinity first. I saw the post on 7 DPS and understand Deaths Fury may not be all it was tooted.<br />
<br />
You said you MIGHT or &quot;PROLLY&quot; go with Pet Affinity. Never said you were &quot;GOING&quot; with it. <br />
<br />
I may decide on Pet Affinity because zoning makes it more valueable now. Prolly go PA then DF.<br />
<br />
See that quote above? That looks like indecision to me. <br />
Fucking Liar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Oagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I would have preferred suspended minion over some of the other POS stuff they gave us.  I use it all the time with my shaman.  Sorry we lost that one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>frotty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Can anyone with Pet Affinity report what the new DPS of the pet is after an ideal buffing situation?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Rhumba_Kween</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I remember Brael reporting around 50dps with best of the best geared bards in the group. I've parsed at 36dps frequently with a Pre-elemental bard and Mage fully equipping the pet in the group. Along with Shammy and Chanter buffs. This also included Aura of Hate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I would be very suprised if the pet could do anywhere close to 50 dps. Its max hit without the crits is 55 I think.<br />
<br />
I would think if its doing 30 dps thats pretty darn good for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>kharan_zechts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">PA is a little pricey compared to other aa but if your at the 500 mark with nothing else to buy its worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Rhumba_Kween</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I would think if its doing 30 dps thats pretty darn good for it<br />
<br />
Our pet does 30dps with just Chanter Haste. No need to have PA to get 30dps. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Housedown</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Pet Hold is the nuts.  Any tool that you can consider using in weird situations is good.  If you need buffs on boney in hard LDONs, just make the casters single cast stuff.  Pet hold can not be simulated as well as that.  Yeah, you can make a /pet back off key and crank it but it's only like half as good.  Making casters buff your pet separately is at least 80% as good as affinity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Chania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Look at it this way: Pet Affiny allows you to:<br />
<br />
1) Heal your pet for 500+ hp<br />
2) Buff your pet with 100+ ATK (Pet Ferocity!)<br />
3) Steal group buffs for your pet that otherwise you'd have to beg to get cast for him, giving him over 1K hp more, or almost a 50% boost in HP, thus his survivability<br />
4) Take advantage of bard buffs, further healing/ATK buffing/Hasting Jabober.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's great for 6 man groups, its great for soloing, but it is a little lacking on raids, as he still dies far too easily. Still, I don't regret the purchase one bit.<br />
<br />
Bottom line: This AA's value is directly proportional to how much you use your pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Gash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Bottom line: This AA's value is directly proportional to how much you use your pet.<br />
Conversely, if you get this AA, you may end up using your pet more.</div></div><hr />
