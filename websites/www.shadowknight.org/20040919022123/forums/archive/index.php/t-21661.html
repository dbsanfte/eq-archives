<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>gaeanin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Simple question:<br />
<br />
Which one should I go for first? Lighting Reflexes or Inate Defence or should I do a bit of both?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
they both reduce damage similar amounts.  LR helps reduce interrupts due to being hit less.  Most seem to go LR first, but I'm not sure it matters much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mathas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I would say LR first, just because less hits  = less portential for interrupts.<br />
<br />
Do ID right after, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Oberyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Personally, I did LR first, and am currently working on polishing off ID.  <br />
<br />
I wish I had done it in the other order.  <br />
<br />
I notice less spell interrupts with LR against the mobs I solo for XP during the week.  Definite difference there when I tank them,  which is what I wanted.<br />
<br />
When I group and tank in GoD sewers, which is about the top end stuff I can manage to tank (over 1K hits, unslowables) I wish I had done the mitigation discipline first, to smooth out the damage spikes somewhat.  Makes it easier for the healer to predict and see whats going on, which makes me live longer, in general:P<br />
<br />
I didn't think I'd be doing as much in GoD as I am, and playtime has mainly been limited to soloing and grouping on weekends the last while, so I did LR, thinking about the soloing.<br />
<br />
Now, tanking the harder stuff, I should have done ID first.<br />
<br />
Your mileage may vary, but think about what it is you do in game and choose accordingly.<br />
<br />
And get both:)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dakkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">LR is marginally better than ID, because ID can only work on the 70% or so of attacks that aren't already completely avoided with LR5.  i.e. it's 30% less effective than LR.<br />
<br />
Having said which, although overall improvement from ALL tanking AAs stacked is huge, LR5 is only a 5% increase in avoidance and ID5 a 5% increase in mitigation in the first place so neither will produce a perceptible improvement and you'd need a parser to tell the difference.<br />
<br />
But if you're looking for maximum theoretical efficiency, go for LR first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm not sure that ID will reduce the damage spike problem all that much.  Probability of taking a massive spike is a bit less but it will still happen, and not that infrequently depending on the mob.  By the time you're tanking much in GoD, you should probably have both already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>gaeanin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thank you to all who have responded. I believe I will go with ID first so that I may iron out some of the damage spikes, so that it is easier on the healer :)</div></div><hr />
