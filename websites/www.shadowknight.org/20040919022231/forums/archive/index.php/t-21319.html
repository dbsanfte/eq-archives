<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Moonslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What in the hell are they doing with all our spells lately? If you look on lucy probably 50% of our spells have had some modification, but the changes listed are modified values for unknown 178 or something. Anyone know what exactly they are doing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Please don't let it be a Hate modifier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Moonslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">http://lucy.allakhazam.com/newspells.html?source=Live&amp;date=2004-05-05%2011:15:35<br />
<br />
Don't think it's a hate modifier because a lot of NPC only spells had the same modification made.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Lots of non SK spells changed to.  Wizard, Enchanter, etc...  Actually that looks like a majority of the detremintal spells in the game if not all of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Moonslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">They're up to no good.<br />
<br />
-.-</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Khat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The only thing I've noticed from that is that they are categorizing the spells for whatever reason.  I.E.  This is a DoT, this is a Lifetap, etc.<br />
<br />
Never did try to correlate what the Unknown fields were for, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Arkis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">not all detrimental are affected (terrors line are not, but maybe it's because hate is already done in spell himself...).<br />
Categorizing tho is maybe for when you right click the gem ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Morgian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The reason for the new entries is only this: they changed the format of spells to be able to be better able to modify effects and control stacking issues. The current read program for the spell data file just has not been brought up to current standard, so the values shown dont mean anything has changed, only that they now could tweak another aspect of spells.<br />

Morgian</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Androsulach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Any clues on Unknown 180 and Unknown 179?<br />
<br />
On the few spells, including Harm Touch, that I looked at, both 180 and 179 had positive numbers and both went up.</div></div><hr />

No idea what you are talking about. Care to clarify what was changed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>DConquest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Think of it like what they did with the Flowing Thought / Vengence items, but with the spell effects.  Just organizing it better so specific spell effects or parts can be modified / classified easier.</div></div><hr />
