<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chova</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is there a specific camp for these or are they just spread around the zone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Stugein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Spread out.  &quot;Trap&quot; based I believe (hidden until you come close to them) in a lot of cases.  There is no one specfic camp with a concentration of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>jyaik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The dryads spawn from little fires on the forest floor. They are grey and orange, grey ones spawn rangers and orange ones druids. Fight them where they spawn, if you try to pull they will often buff up before following making them tougher to kill. If you head straight out from the cave with the gnoll banker/basilisks and a tiny bit towards hippie village you will come upon some in the woods. The three closest to the basilisk cave are in an area where there are NO roamers. There are other spawns but bears and snakes or whatever roam through there. You can kill these three repeatedly, forget the spawn time but the down time in between kills isn't terrible. They rarely drop barkleather armor which apparently is pretty decent for beastlords. They also drop leaves and other stuff so the plat isn't so terrible. I never feared them but when they run on low health they head towards the hippie village, which is a good bit away, and not out into the middle of the zone. This is an extremely safe and boring camp but the dryads make nice eye candy. Exp is pretty good in the low 50s. Interrupt the druid chicks and they are cake but they hit hard when they start meleeing after they blow their mana. This three spawn camp was usually free a year ago or so and is probably even more empty now. If you can do these babes you can prolly handle the gnolls which are easy single pulls once you get to the back caverns, pretty much no chance of an add in the back caverns unlike the tunnels heading in there. Only did the poachers once, think you need some kind of harmony/pacify for them unless you want to try to pet pull, fd pull which can be time consuming. Forgot to mention that the dryads spawn when you walk within melee range of the flames on the ground. If you have spell effects or somesuch turned off in your options you will NOT see the flames on teh ground!! They are not kos I dont think until you trash your faction with them, they are on their own faction and none of the other tree huggers are on dryad faction apparently. Good luck.</div></div><hr />
