I'm trying to roll up an SK and I want the best of everything. I'd like to describe my play style and I'd like some feedback on how to proceed with race selection and also point allocation. <br />
<br />
This character is going to be my solo character. I have a rogue and he obviously is very group intensive. When I want a break from searching for a good group, I want to have Mr. SK here to bang around the mobs for a bit.<br />
<br />
Also, I dont have alot of time at any one time to play. I play in little bites. So I'm trying to find a decent balance overall.<br />
<br />
From what I've read, Trolls seem to be the kings of solo. Is this true? Can someone compare relative difficulties between Troll and Iksar?<br />
<br />
I'll even consider a gnome if it is the right choice. Just looking for guidence.<br />
<br />
Thanks in Advance my dark-hearted bretheren!<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
<br />
GAH! I just found Dark Beginnings on the front page. Anyway, I'll read that but if anyone cares to comment either way, I'll check back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ghob Owar</div><div class="date">03-29-2002, 02:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Welcome!<br />
<br />
Before we begin... ask yourself one question. What race do YOU want to be?<br />
<br />
Each race has it's own merits... the skinny fellas will tell you that they're the best, the fat guys will tell you the same. I haven't met a Gnome yet that I couldn't compliment with a nice Oatmeal Stout. YUMMAE!<br />
<br />
Personally, I'm an Ogre. Originally I chose him because he's got the best melee stats going. High STR and STA... now I play him because he's fun. I like RPing and /grunting and telling the little Elfies that I'll eat them if they 'dun gimmae happy feets'.<br />
<br />
My second choice was Troll because I really like their looks.<br />
<br />
I played a Gnome for a bit... but they're just too goofy in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Never played a Tier'dal to high enough levels... but they're a dime-a-dozen too... The Dead really seems to breed SKs like they're going to take over the world or something.<br />
<br />
I never wanted to play an Iksar. Again, just my own opinion... but the inability to wear plate bothered me.<br />
<br />
I also never wanted to play a human. Just my POV, but if I wanted to be a human, I'd just strap on a sword and rob a bank IRL (shouting stuff like &quot;BACK VARMINT LEST YE BE HARM TOUCHED!&quot; just to freak people out).<br />
<br />
Basically, as I'm sure you'll see and hear. Don't play for the numbers (even though I admit that's how I started). Being with this versitile class means that you can succeed with any of the races given. It's all a matter of taste... (brb... got another Gnome on the barbie-q) ;).<br />
<br />
Have fun, and ask lots of questions. Also in terms of where to put your points, IMO unless you're a fatty... put 'em into STA.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neq</div><div class="date">03-29-2002, 02:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you are going to be soloing a lot regen becomes more important IMO thus I would think troll or iksar would be best for what you want. As for which of the 2 is better, I'd say go with whichever one you think looks cooler as they both have improved regen :D<br />
<br />
When faced with basically the same decision I chose iksar because ...<br />
<br />
1) I like the look<br />
2) Not many around (I like unique!)<br />
3) Improved regen + Natural AC<br />
<br />
And I've never regretted it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krazaak</div><div class="date">03-29-2002, 03:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hard call as to which is better solo.  I'd probably go with the Troll, since I prefer 2H weapons for soloing for added damage output and the Troll can still bash with a 2H weapon.<br />
<br />
If you plan to go with 1H primarily, then I'd go with Iksar, since the extra AC will help lower the damage you take in the later levels.  In the earlier levels, the AC bonus will help offset the AC lost due to your inability to wear plate and a lack of commonly available iksar armor.<br />
<br />
Some people will say that regen doesn't make much difference at higher levels, but I strongly disagree.  The difference between a Troll and Darkelf regen at higher levels is about equal to the regen added by a fungi tunic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some questions:<br />
<br />
1. Seems I can only train in Grobb... Where else can I train initially?<br />
<br />
2. How do I get up my faction with the Dead? Will I ever be able to get faction up with them? Seems I've read there is a long drawn-out way to do this. <br />
<br />
<br />
3. I worship Inny... Is this better from a &quot;can use&quot; equipment point of view? Or is Cazic Better over all? does it matter?<br />
<br />
4. What cities am I KOS? <br />
<br />
5. What armor should I look for after bronze? I had someone give me a bunch from Najena, so I'm set for now, but looking ahead.<br />
<br />
Ok that's about all I have for now. Thanks for all the input!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lord Vedar</div><div class="date">04-02-2002, 04:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing to consider. First off I'm Human. Trolls have what? 1 or 2 points more Regen and more of a xp penalty. So its going to take a troll or Iksar longer to level. Also Trolls and Ogres have low int, Low Int = not as much mana. If your soloing you need mana, hp is not as important. And my personal beef with Large races is they get in the way and stuck in small hallways. I not saying Big races arn't good, just Regen 1 hp more does not a soloer make.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kwell</div><div class="date">04-02-2002, 04:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its quite simple really.  Iksars have more of an advantage.<br />
<br />
1.  AC bonus<br />
2.  Excellent vision<br />
3.  Great swimmers<br />
4.  Regen<br />
5.  More intelligent than Ogres/Trolls<br />
6.  We are not as wide as we are tall, so moving through dungeons is not a task.  (such is the case w/ Ogres/Trolls.<br />
7.  And most importantly, Iksars get all the women!<br />
<br />
Now some would say that Iksars cant wear plate.  DO NOT worry about this.  We can wear all Velious quest armors and all higher end BP's such as Vindicator.  There are exceptions, such as Blood Ember and Darkforge, but the best stuff we can wear.<br />
<br />
Most importantly of all though:  Play what you want to play.  Whatever class you think is the coolest, for whatever reason..play it.<br />

(Cept the part about the chics!  guys that are named after cartoon characters get all the chics dude :eek: )   But he conveniently neglected to mention the <br />
<br />
1.  xp penalty (on top of the hybrid penalty for being SK)<br />
2.  The fact you are KOS in every city other than cabilis<br />
3.  You cannot wear plate armor (DO worry about this)<br />
4.  Have mediocre base str/int (Being smarter than an ogre or troll is nothing to be proud of :D )<br />

Just thought I would bring those to light.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KaeruWak</div><div class="date">04-02-2002, 05:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">you have chosen...wisely<br />
<br />
For training, you can TRAIN in Oggok, East Freeport, and Neriak SK guilds (some of those take some hunting around to find, if you dont know where they are).  You can only buy spells in Grobb and maybe Oggok though.<br />
<br />
In that area, you're KoS in all of Freeport except Rogue and SK guilds, some parts of Oggok (shaman and warrior guilds).  As a Innoruuk worshipper you shouldnt be KoS anywhere in Neriak, but you are dubious in a few.<br />
<br />
As for Innoruuk v. Cazic...both have minor benefits but It's not going to affect you much either way.  You might be *less* KoS in some spots depending on which way you go.<br />
<br />
If there are so few Lizards, why is there 2 times the pro-lizard propaganda then any other race (save maybe smurfs)!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rubicaant</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 12:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, whoever said taht the regen difference is what? 1-2 pts of difference, no, it's always double whatever others regen for, at 51 it is 12 per tick, a lot better than 6 per tick, especially if  your faced with soloing every once and a while</div></div><hr />

I thought they took out the &quot;hybrid&quot; XP penalty like a year ago... am I mistaken? <br />
<br />
No, you am'nt mistaken. It was removed quite a while ago. Not sure if it's been a year or not though.<br />
Personally, I would have gone with Iksar. The newbie areas are *much* better than Innothule. Lots of newbie quests, and the khukri/Greenmist quests are way cool.<br />
<br />
There is a new, improved way to raise faction with The Dead. Around the pyramid in Nektulos are a bunch of very low level (4-6 or so) high elves that give +The Dead, and -High Elf Factions. I'm assuming you're not planning on shopping in Felewithe or Riverdale. Kill them, kill the Halflings, Kill the Dorkbags of Rodcet, and you'll raise faction The Dead, Dread Guard Inner &amp; Outer, and Bloodsabres. Just do the red wine quest to raise faction with Dark Bargainers, and you're all set for Neriak and Qeynos (evil side).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smiiley</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 09:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I chose troll for a couple of reasons:<br />
<br />
1. I like the look of big, nasty weapons. So partly, it was for vanity's sake. Also, I like the look of plate and (please no offense) the new models for iksar look... well just too pudgy for what I envision a lizard to be. /shrug Just not me.  Same reason I didn't go with Ogre... the buckethead look was transfered to Hummies to Ogres /frown<br />
<br />
2. Regen does hold some consideration for me. True it's not the end all, but I will almost exclusively solo. Now... let me ask... will regen outweigh the EXP and mana deficiency? I have an int (buffed with some items) of 87, so I'm not really low, but I'm not a brainiac either... Oppinions welcomed.<br />
<br />
3. I like to roleplay big and stoopid. True we are smart, but who says I have to have good language skillz ;-)<br />
<br />
Also, just to note, someone up top said I could train in Neriak... You cannot train in Neriak as a TSK without faction work. I've tried and they refuse to deal with Trolls... At least not at the Lodge. Is there another place?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the input!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ghob Owar</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 04:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Freeport sewers is probably ythe closest to Nektulos to train.<br />
<br />
I'd started Ghob before the new models came out, but I totally agree... I personally don't like 75% of the new models... Ogres included. I think they look meaner (and yet a bit more dopey too) in the old models.<br />
<br />
I really hate the new troll model myself... they look &quot;pudgy&quot; to say the least... the old models were SO much cooler (if I had to remake Ghob and couldn't be an Ogre... he'd be a Troll (old model)).<br />
<br />
I think you'll like your Troll. We fatties have to stick together... Ghob's INT isn't the greatest... I think with all my INT equipment on (Including a bunch of Sentinel and a MoSS) it's still only at around 118. Usual gear, I stand right around 100 (but he's drunk about 95% of the time... so INT is usually lower *hehe*). I barely ever loot because I have a backpack of booze / bandages / food &amp; water / &quot;bag of tricks&quot;... I just don't have the room ;). <br />
<br />
But the point I was making is that I rarely have a problem going OOM, most of our spells last quite a while (like the Screams and Grim Aura) or don't cost all that much (Like DC).<br />
<br />
What server are you on anyway?....</div></div><hr />

If you are unable to train at the Neriak SK guild it is because you killed something that lowerd faction.  Stone guardians?  Dorn maybe?  Neriak is definitely one of the cities you can start out training and buying/banking at as a troll SK.  Thats a faction you should fix ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Droyt</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 07:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a level 53 human shadowknight and absolutely love how the world looks, as opposed to when viewed with the infravision or ultravision races.  Seeing Neriak through the eyes of a human shadowknight (follower of Innoruuk, starting in Freeport) is a must, and I tell all my friends to start one on a different server just to see it.  But I've also started an ogre shadowknight.<br />
<br />
My human SK has decent stats, but always had trouble carrying his gear around; he's always encumbered.  His stamina is also low.  Intelligence is ok however, but I tend to melee more than cast (taunt spells and FD).<br />
<br />
My new ogre SK should have significantly more HPs.  His higher strength coupled with the fact that he cannot be stunned from the front should increase his damage output (how much I do not know).  But the major downside of the ogre is his girth.  Dungeons are not ogre friendly since they often have narrow corridors.  And getting many tanks around a mob (raid situation) is sometimes problematic (shrink or wolf form helps).  My halfling rogue on the other hand moves around easily even when there are tons of people around (10-20 tanks attacking a target).<br />
<br />
My advice is to choose a race that appeals to you, and to have fun.</div></div><hr />

~Happened to me today, leaving SolB. There was a mass of people outside... I seriously doubt even a Skinny would be able to fit. But I had to shout to get them to clear the passage way for me... everyone filed out onto the the cliff-face and out popped this chubby spear wielding Ogre. I felt like the mountain was giving birth to me... all sides of the thing were touching some part of my body.  <br />
<br />
Thanks for bearing with me but these in particular put a smile on my face :)~ Had to edit to add one that was too cute to not add :-)~<br />

<br />
Anyhow I play an erudite female SK and enjoy the constant PvP on Vallon Zek and the occasional &quot;gooseing&quot; that I receive from all my &quot;fatty&quot; admirers.  I do enjoy having the highest inteligence and all the man...err mana I have to play with. I am definatley not saying that the erudite SK is the best because I truly adore Inky's and Fatties and admire how well they play and PvP (Iksars too for jumpkicking my Arse when I least expected it)  Hats off to you all :)<br />

<br />
Nope I'm only lvl 11 and I've only done one quest: bonehcips to hukulk. and that was one time. I am dubious to DE SKs and tehy refuse to train me... For the record I have killed:<br />
<br />
snakes<br />
skeletons<br />
lesser kobolds<br />
some halflings in Nektulos<br />
Guk froggies<br />
Befallen baddies<br />
One named Skeleton in Nektulos- Ann or something like that. <br />
Puntar- the Barbarian (faction hit= Karana)<br />
Scarabs<br />
wolves<br />
bears<br />
<br />
And that is it ;-)<br />
<br />
<br />
Can anyone make a newbie troll and confirm this for me? If I did something it was a doozy, because I am dubious and I was before I hit lvl 5.<br />
<br />
Again for the record, I worhip Inny and I've only hunted 5 zones:<br />
EC, Befallen, Nektulos, Innithule and NRO<br />
<br />
<br />
I intend to whack these Wizard Spire mobs I heard about, so hopefully that will fix me up. BTW, is there any issue with us Inny TSKs getting faction in Cabalis? I read the great article at the old site, so I know about bones and tehn the rest, but will all races of SK be ok to get GM?<br />
<br />
Oh and I'm on Quellious =)</div></div><hr />
