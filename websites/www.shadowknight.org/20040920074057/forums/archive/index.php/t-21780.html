<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gargar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">WOOHOO!  Had some help from some great folks. Had everything for 4 months, just hadnt gone to get him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aoninie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">GRATZ from another SK on Zeb!!!! I have only the Soul Leech left to finish mine. As I'm currently deployed in Iraq it will be awhile though. So how many did you have for Lhanac and how hard did you think he was? I should be able to put together 3 groups average lvl 62 fairly easy. Think that will be enough?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gargar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">SHOULD be cake. The tank i had tho was pretty tweaked out. 65 war buddy of mine with a bazillion aa's and whatnot. Seems like he went down in under minute. <br />
<br />
I had 3 groups. avg level 62.  <br />
<br />
My hands were shaking and sweating...   but they were shaking and sweating with my IC in them.  <br />
<br />
<br />
:-D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Enrikk Xei'Maxximus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">WOOT and GRATZ!<br />
<br />
Three groups, average level 62, this is the kind of information I needed.<br />
<br />
I too only need Soul Leech, after having taken care of Glohnor earlier this day. <br />
<br />
I look forward to holding my own Curse, and laughing at those who do not.<br />
<br />
Someone wiser than I once stated, &quot;There are two types of Shadow Knights, those WITH IC, and those without.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amen.</div></div><hr />
