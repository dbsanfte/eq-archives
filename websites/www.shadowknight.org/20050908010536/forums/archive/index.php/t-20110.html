<br />
I play a moderately equiped shadowknight, and have been putting all my aa's into hp, mitigation, and avoidance.  However, when i look at leech curse, and improved harm touch both say uses existing harm touch timers.<br />
<br />
Does leechcurse replace the harm touch, or do you get a choice with it (more damage or health)?<br />
<br />
Oh, and does unholy aura stack with both or either.<br />
<br />
Thanks :D<br />

<br />
You can either Heal youself and do like 1500 Damage <br />
<br />
OR<br />
<br />
Do 8k+ with Unholy Aura and Imp.HT + UT3<br />
<br />
Not Both.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kazadeth</div><div class="date">02-19-2004, 05:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can do the UA HT and Leechcurse now.<br />
<br />
To get it to work, do your UA HT then open your combat window (ctrl+c).  There will be an icon showing that UA is curently activated.  Click it to turn it off.<br />
<br />
You can now activate Leechcurse.<br />
<br />
They are no longer on the same timer but you can only have one of them activated at a time which is why you click off UA in the combat window.  If you don't, you have to wait the 20 mins or whatever it is until the UA effect fades, then you can use LC.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The first reply was correct, you can activate either the big bang improved HT (the 8K one) or the Leech one (the life tap).  <br />
<br />
Each ability will have its own button, but pressing one will darken both until your HT timer refreshes.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yaz</div><div class="date">04-05-2004, 03:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I bought all the HT AA including the timer decrease.  I went ahead and bought Leech Touch as well.  Since my HT timer is now half it really isn't a big deal if I need to blow that Leech Touch in an emergency situation as my HT will refresh in 36 minutes now.  If I blow the HT on soemthing with the Disc it's okay as  well since the UA disc won't refresh for like 55 minutes HT will pop back if for some rerason I need to pop Leech Touch.  Then when UA finally does pop again my HT will follow behind shortly.  Mostly I abuse the HT timer to land crit HT's every 36 minutes but I have also been happy that I decreased the timer and bought Leech Touch because it has saved my life in tight places.  It's worth it.  Now if I ever buy those damndable Leech Touch increases, It will be better, unless of course some bastage decides to resist it like those stupid highborns in Veksar.  Too bad it's not unresistable.</div></div><hr />
