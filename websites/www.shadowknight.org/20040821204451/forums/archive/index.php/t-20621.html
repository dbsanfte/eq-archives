Right. So, the Spanish have elected the Socialists. Hoo-fucking-ra for Communism.<br />
<br />
Anyway, because we can't actually do it in real life, enjoy the kill everyone project (http://homokaasu.org/killeveryone/)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jobrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">To be fair, Communism is one small subset of Socialism. There are other types. <br />
<br />
However, Socialism still sucks.<br />
<br />
To be fair, I think Spain would have pretty much voted for any opposing party, they just wanted to get the current ruling party out of power.<br />
<br />
Still, you know what message this has sent...<br />
<br />
&quot;Dear Terrorists,<br />
<br />
Congratulations, you win. All you have to do is continue killing people and destroying lives, and we'll continue to roll over and appease you, and ostracize and reject those of us who actually have a backbone and are willing to strike back.<br />
<br />
Keep planning those massive attacks, and we'll keep cowering in fear!<br />

The Voters of Spain.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Many westeuropean countries are ruled by socialist and thats not a bit communism much less like the facist the rule america tody! Jobrill is right the socialist in spain won cuz auf the bombing but the spain govermet was just to dumb to sell the bombing like G.W. <br />
Bush sold 9.11 to the american's. If they had said from the begining the i could have been islam terrorist the spainsh ppl would have been HAPPY to send their troops to iraq tryin to find some oh so dangerous Bio or Chemical Weapons that were appenrently never there.<br />
So now the new goverment does the only really good: Pull their guys out of Iraq and let the US troops and their dumb sheepish supporters like Poland or the UK experienxe their Desert-Vietnam!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grobobos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">the spanish socialist are as far from communism as the democrats are from the christian coalition if that gives you are better clue of what happens outside your farm hole in Nebraska..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Paynreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just FYI, i was poking fun at the Spanish. I know the difference between Communism and Socialism. Its called an exaggeration.<br />
<br />
As for Desert Vietnam, give me one shred of proof that you have one fucking idea what you're talking about.<br />
<br />
President Bush isnt perfect - he is really goddamn far from it - but you know what he has that way too many people don't? A fucking spine. The man has guts and the will to do whats needed even if its unpleasant, and even if pussies like you tell him not to.<br />
<br />
President Bush refuses to bend over and get fucked by the terrorists, and thats why he sure as hell has my vote.<br />
<br />
As for Britain and our other supporters? Good for them.<br />
<br />

As far as Spain goes 90% of the people were against the war yet the president took a stand and sent people in anyway, he had a spine.  The new government knee jerked into pulling people out of iraq cause thats what won them the election.<br />
<br />
And to everyone who opposed war in Iraq, I take it you condone mass supression, torture, genocide, murder, religious persecution, no freedom of speech and a leader with several palacial buildings who lives as a king while a majority of his people live in deplorable conditions and die from lack of the basics.<br />

Wether we were right or wrong to goto Iraq on the reasons of WMD's, a deplorable excuse for a human being has been removed from his seat of power and hopefully the country will have a new start.</div></div><hr />

Ya, we attacked Iraq over its sovereign boundarys, omg, boohoo.<br />
<br />
Fucking Saddam was basically a mafia boss who had taken control of a country full of idiots who evidently don't know how to stage a revolution.  We did them a favor they didn't deserve in kicking him the fuck out, and yet they still can't show any gratitude because Hate for us is all they've been fed since they were born.<br />
<br />
I agree with the scorched earth scenario.  If a country doesn't want to face annihilation, maybe they'll get off of their asses and catch/kill these nutbags instead of supporting them under the table.<br />
<br />
My main gripe is the Iraqi's who say they were &quot;humiliated&quot; by how quickly and easily America took over their country.  Wtf did they expect?  Weren't they around for the gulf war?  Jesus.<br />

Grim please pull your head out of your ass for 1 second to realize that Saddam had ties to Al Queda and Saddam had a huge military with weapons that he was not supposed to have (missles that shot beyond the boundrys specified by earlier treaties). Not to mention Afghanistan and the fact we cleared out the all of the Al queda training camps and caught some of the major players of that group. Also with Pakistan helping us get into the lawless northern part of pakistan/afghanistan where they believe Osama is currently hiding do you ohnestly think we have done nothing to fight this problem? Also has there been another attack on our homeland? How many have been stopped?</div></div><hr />

By your logic, we should allow a certian percentage of terrorist murders of our people without retaliation to keep it at that low percentage. Yeah, that makes sense, you fucking retard. My countrymen are not cattle who are subject to random terrorist murder to keep the world fucking happy.<br />
When they crash some civilian planes into the most prominant financial institution in YOUR country, what the fuck are you gonna do, say those civilians were acceptable losses to keeping peace, sit down adn have tea with the fuckers and figure out just what you did to piss them off?<br />
Not very likely, my friend.<br />
As a civilian of the USA, I'd rather die to terrorist attacks because we WERE taking action, not because we WERENT taking action.<br />
Think about it.<br />
When you grow up a little a realise that  they want to kill me and everyone like me, maybe you'll realise why I dont have a problem with erradicating them.</div></div><hr />

 This is the war on TERRORISM. Not the War on Osama Bin Laden. And like it or not, There is ample Evidence that Saddam Hussein is a terrorist, and pretty much EVERYONE Democrat and Republican was convinced he had WMDs ever since the Gulf War. It was only when Bush got the guts to do something about it that the Democrats suddenly turned against him to strengthen thier own position. Before that, they were all gung-ho on the clear and present danger Saddam Hussein threatened to freedom and democracy.<br />
<br />
I don't paticularly like Bush. I voted for someone else (Not Gore or Nader, btw) the last election, and I'm not completely sure he'll get my vote this time either. But I will give him credit where credit is due.<br />
<br />
Hell, considering that a couple rogue nations have openly admited to selling Nukes to other rogue nations, a missle defense system MIGHT not be a bad idea. Any serious student of Terrorism will tell you it's only a matter of time before some Terror group gets the cahones to try ICBMs. <br />
<br />
Besides, Were you paying attention in the aftermath of 9/11? Afghanistan was the headquarters of Al Qaeda. We took out Al Qaeda's powerbase. And just because the media is not reporting on it 24/7, do you not think we still have troops in there scouring the country for Bin Laden? There is a lot going behind the scenes that is either classified, or that the mainstream press doesn't report on. <br />
<br />
4. Even if the Spanish Government was a bit too eager to blame ETA (And it's still possible this could have been a joint raid between Al Qaeda and an especially militant faction of ETA, the Investigation into this incident is FAR from over), the fact remains that the Spanish people KNOWINGLY voted in a government whose main platform is that they will be soft on terrorism, that they will appease whenever possible. Like it or not, This WILL Hearten Terrorists, and this WILL convince them that thier acts of massive destruction are EFFECTIVE. <br />
<br />
Here's another question...Let's assume it was Al'Qaeda or another group of Islamic Terrorists who attacked Spain (And this hasn't been proven who did it yet, remember). Why do you think they attacked Spain instead of America?<br />
<br />
Maybe because, say... They couldn't get into America to set up an attack because of our security measures?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>:asylumbound:</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">All good uneducated points.<br />
<br />
Our government since its insurrection to power has been the biggest, most advanced, and well maintained terrorist and breader of terrorist that exists.  If our fellow countrymen were brave enouph to read and listen to the proof instead of brushing it aside and labeling it liberal propaganda &quot; a most destructive label&quot; we are probably to far gone to do anything about it.  <br />
<br />
Ill give you some homework.  Are the following statements true or false.<br />
<br />
A. Our government was directly responsible for the Oklahoma City Bombing. <br />
<br />
B. Our government was directly responsible for the events on September 11. (see Northwoods Document)<br />
<br />
On give you a little push.  If you look at pictures of the Oklahoma City building after the bombing you will see a little more than half the building with a large half circle blown out of it.  Supposedly, Tim Mcveigh &quot;and the unidentified man&quot; packed a Ryder truck full of high powered explosives and remotely detonated it killing and wounding many men women and children.  This open air detonation blew off the entire face and halfway through this structure?  I dont fucking think so.  Accounts of the people that were at or near the building that day have something important in common.  They all heard multiple explosions.  Most of them heard two explosions.  So it was more than one bomb that brought the building down?  Yes there were several.  The bomb in the ryder truck and three others that did not explode.  Plus the demolition charges that were placed throughout the building meant to destroy the support structure.  The demolition charges were set off at precisely the same time but a little after the truck explosion which is why people heard two explosions one right after the other.  This is properly documented by sizmograph readings.  The one that really got me thinking was when the ATF agents that were stationed at the building were tipped off before work on their pagers not to come into work that day.  They could have warned the children in the day care.<br />
<br />
All of this stuff was reported and ignored dismissed and swept under the rug.  Why?  Because it is fucking terrifying.<br />
<br />
You can find all of this information at www.infowars.com<br />
Anothergood source of info is freedomtv on the winamp tv channels if you have a decent connection.  If you can get through the unsubstantiated conspiracy theories and to the actual factually supported information you will be disturbed.<br />
<br />
My standing on this is hopefully we will all be dead and burried before whatever end game they have in mind comes to pass.  And because of all this I will never have kids.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>shadowfox98</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">the majority of people in spain were agianst the war, but the government sent troops anyway.  So if the government is no longer acknowledging the people then it needs to change.  HOWEVER giving terror tactics a victory means eventually your government will be run by terror.  People will use these tactics to get what they want.   The most unsettling thing about terrorists is that they DONT have to do anything to get thier results.  One 9-11 or 3-11 and all they have to do is threaten to do it agian and that country will be tossed into turmol.  We have to do something about terrorism, but we can't just bomb it or attack it.<br />
<br />
The &quot;War on Terror&quot; means nothing because in order to have a war you have to have a way to end it.  terrorism will never go away.  We can have a war to capture Osama, or some other person, but not &quot;on terrorism&quot;  A defined objective.<br />
<br />
Bush at least doesn't roll over.  I think he used the wrong reason to oust Saddam.  Had he just said, &quot;the UN resolution that they pressured us to sign (took four months and alot of arguement to get a one vote majority)  Legally obligates us to do something.  So let's do it.&quot;  NO ONE can argue that Saddam was good for Iraq or the middle east.  He needed to be removed.</div></div><hr />

They killed our civilians in the World Trade Center and the passenger jets they flew into teh World Trade Center. If that isn't clear and present enough for you, nothing is. The fact that they hide in and behind countries means fuck all. Get out of the way or get run over. Period.  Let me ask you again,  What about the innocent Americans killed? <br />
<br />

quote of me by Howler:<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
War is an ugly business, i can imagine at times collateral damage is unavoidable. But it is the resposibility of a civilized military (yes, i'm aware of the contradiction here) is to stick to military targets, avoid collateral damage and <br />
<br />
protect innocent life. <br />
Play out your scorched earth scenario . . . it is over and done, the sand's nothing but smoldering nuclear glass . . . what are you going to say when me and millions of other people are in your face calling you a murderer??<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
Howler:<br />
I'd be asking you what the fuck you were doing when they were plotting to kill, and did kill, your countrymen and allies in their homelands. You can get together with your buddies and raise enough stink to keep your countrymen from killing innocents in foriegn lands, but you sure as hell can't raise a big enough stink to keep our enemies from killing us. So which is it? Which one do you want?<br />
<br />
My soldiering days are done, i was at work.  Like i've been saying, pat attention here this is important, the problem is identifying, and locating legitamate military targets got it?  Bottom line, we fight back the best way possible.  And I'll still be callin you a murderer.<br />
And I'll not be giving a rats ass WHAT you call me.<br />
Let me ask you again : How many innocent American deaths is OK to keep the peace, to keep from possibly killing innocents in another country? How many is ok for you? I'm not the one with comprehension problems here, little buddy. <br />
How about how many of your OWN countries  civilians is it alright for to be murdered to keep the peace? 10? 1000? 10,000?<br />
A legitimate military target, in my eyes, is wherever a threat to my nation and my countrymen is located.<br />
<br />
Howler:<br />

Neat, so all terrorists have to do to avoid retribution is hide in the middle of civilians, they got off scott-free. It's thinking like yours that allows these groups to thrive.<br />

No, not a tribalist, your bloodlust, your power-centric inflated ego, and your simple mind make you something far, far worse.<br />
You don't know me. Don't ever, ever pretend to know things about  me, or the ways I think, or accuse me of having bloodlust or an inflated ego. I hate the thought of people dying needlessly. I don't think, in this case, that it fits the requirements for 'needless', however.<br />
<br />
/edit : just reread the 'simple mind' part. Man, you are a card. Don't assume anything,  it makes you look like an ass. Don't talk about what you don't know. Makes life easier for you.<br />
<br />
Busch lied to you, try to be a man and face it.  <br />
Thats it man. I'm facing facts. Fact is, a bunch of people want to kill me and my country men. And I don't want them to, and anything we as Americans do to prevent deaths of American cvilians and her allies, I'm up for.<br />
<br />
It is so easy for you fucking American hating europeans to say &quot;Do this and do that, and you shouldnt do that&quot; when it ISN'T fucking happeneing to you.<br />
When it does happen to you, guess who will be standing behind your country? Thats right, us. And then you can bitch about us helping you too.<br />
Young age, innocence, naivete and an idealistic outlook are all very cute and endearing, but they sure won't get you very far in the real world. Lemme know when your idealism is worn down enough by brutal reality to start seeing things the way they are. Until then, keep floating along, my friend.<br />

The war on terror has nothing to do with your religion. Saddam had many ties with terrorist organizations. He supported them as they supported him. They had a common goal, to destroy the USA. When common goals are shared between people with different opinions (i.e. saddam and osama had different religious opinions and people on these boards have many different opinions but we help each other with EQ stuff) they tend to help each other out to achive this common goal. <br />
<br />
As for nuking the middle east i cant say i agree with this. If we were to do that then we would be just as bad as the terrorists and be using the same tactics -Yeah lets kill 10s of thousands of people to scare the shit out of them from attacking us again- Umm that dosnt work. We need to take the moral high ground as we have to prove to the world and the clear thinking muslims that we are not the bad guy, the terrorists are. <br />
<br />
I do agree that bush dosnt communicate to the american people as well as he should about these issues but i also understand that after the CIA giving out bad information (yes the CIA not bush is gathering info on the terrorist threat) bush may want to be a bit more cautious about what he is telling the american public. The american people as well as the UN were never lied to, they were given the information that was available at the time. Iraq didnt need to have WMD's for us to take Saddam out they gave us enough reason form the past 12 years of thumbing their nose at the international community. Also it would be fair to speculate that the WMD's do exist and were moved to a bordering country (possibly syria). Saddam had enought bio-chem suits for his military to lead one to believe that he was planning to do somthing with these WMD's that are yet to be found. As for countrys like France and Germany there is evidence that Saddam sent large sums of money to the govronments before the UN vote (Gee... i wonder why - for those that are slow it was probably a bribe to swing their UN vote). Considering all these factors how can you say bush made a bad decision goin into Iraq. EVERY person that had access to the CIA &quot;evidence&quot; agreed that Saddam had these weapons and posed a serious threat to the well being of the US and europe.</div></div><hr />

Im not advocating the use of nukes in the middle east. I am advocating whatever is necessary to eradicate the larger threats to my fellow Americans.<br />
Fact: Terrorist attacks have been made against Americans on American soil.<br />
Fact: Terrorist attacks have been made against Americans off of American soil.<br />
Fact: These terrorists are often funded by Middle Eastern countries.<br />
Fact: Some Middle Eastern countries shelter these terrorists.<br />
Fact: American soldiers have been a billion times more humane in our wars against these terrorists than the terrorists have been against us.<br />
Opinion: I personally want the threat of attacks against my countrymen minimised to the greatest possible degree.<br />
Opinion: If a country shelters, aids and/or funds terrorist cells that attack and kill American civilians, they get what the terrorists get: Namely, death.<br />

And fascist, please, get a fucking clue.<br />

My countrymen and my country are more important to me than someone elses. Simple as that. Don't care if you don't like it.<br />

And by the way, we are entitled to, no, obligated to, do whatever is necessary to protect our people. Make of that what you will. <br />

Would you mind explaining the economic stradegy behind spending billions and billions of dollars on a war just for a morsel of oil that could have been gotten without the war?  I mean hell, even France (France!) was getting oil illegally from Saddam for years, why couldn't we?  Hell, we were the ones who were making it illegal!  Why not just drop the sanctions in exchange for a juicy oil deal?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>Crot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">i found this  list of interventions  (http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/Blum/US_Interventions_WBlumZ.html) . Maybe the comments are to Harsh but the list alone makes me think may the should have done a bit less of interventing and a bit more of helping. <br />
America did a very good job of stopin the Nazi aggression in Europe (honestly, not the least bit of Sarcasm on this one), but after that America did a lot of decision that range from not-so-good to disaterous in their forign politics. Most of these decision didnt affect the US public at all neither were they shown on the news. But they DID affect the people in other countries and these people couldnt understand why a communist goverment that suppressed them, was far worse to America than the facist Dictator-puppet that the US installed after they chased the Commi's away. Most of times these new goverments were a lot more brutal, but at least they werent Communistic.<br />
<br />
<br />
It really doesnt matter why the US invaded Iraq but it seems really good bet that, after the coallition troops, left we will have another fundamentalistic Sharia State, like Iran.</div></div><hr />

If the Internet existed in the early 1940's, there would be discussions just like this between average German citizens and citizens of other countries around the world.  This isn't comparing Bush to Hitler, or WW2 to Iraq.  It is simply comparing how the citizens of a country can be convinced they are right, while everyone else in the world looks at them in disbelief.<br />
<br />
The Branch Davidians were conviced David Koresh was Jesus Christ, The Peoples Temple were convinced Jim Jones was Jesus Christ, and members of the Solar Temple were convinced that death would help them on their journey to the star Sirius.  Who knows, maybe some or all of them were right.  But you certainly couldn't convince any of them that they were wrong.</div></div><hr />

WTF? You gonna nuke America too you dipshit?  (Oh, except all the people you know and care about)  The whole point is that we are somehow blaming a &quot;COUNTRY&quot; (and some of us a whole section of the continent) for the actions of a few extremely stupid ass-fuckers that happen to hide there.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, the people who say that Saddam is a sick twisted fuck don't realize that Bush happens to be doing to the same type of things... Ignoring UN decisions, taking actions that up his own political power at the cost of his own people.  Saddam is still a much sicker individual and I'm glad he's out of power.  But there are plenty of other problematic leaders/countries out there as well, and war is the worst possible case for both sides.  Do you really want to send our troops out again?  You're interested in protecting Americans, but obviously those American's doing all the fighting don't count...<br />
<br />
Looking at the situation, taking action, and trying to take a stand without backing down is important.  But blindly following and only listening to the propaganda set out before us is no way to do it.  Bush went from terrorism (9-11), to weapons of mass destruction (UN meetings), to humanitarianism (Operation free Iraq), and God only knows what his next reasoning is going to be... all so he could keep the support of his population.<br />
<br />
I was beginning to think that the Electoral College was an outdated system; that the &quot;uneducated masses&quot; would not need to be checked on in such a high information age.  I've realized that real problem is the corruption within the system, because the uneducated mass seems to be getting bigger... and louder...<br />

That is just stupid. If you are too stubborn or too dumb to understand the difference, nothing is going to make you see logic.<br />

I can agree with you to some degree on this. Politics, and politicians, are corrupt by nature. As far as sending our troops, well no, I don't want them hurt or killed. But that's what happens in wars. That's why there are soldiers and civilians. Soldiers fight wars. That's what they are there for. I tried to join the armed forces, but could not get the job I wanted as I am colour-blind. If war started while I were enlisted, I would not balk at my duties.<br />

Again, that's what politicians do.<br />
While I may not agree with Bushs political reasons for doing what he has done, I cant say I disagree with what we are actually doing, however. I'm not blind. I make these decisions for myself after much thought. You have every right to disagree with me. It isn't something we will come to terms with, I am sure.<br />

You shouldn't make assumptions that I or people like me, are uneducated. I do agree that Americans, as a whole, are woefully uneducated and un- or misinformed. Lumping me in with them would be a mistake, however.<br />
I guess it comes down to ethics, for people like me. Do the ends justify the means? In some cases, I think they do. Is this 'unethical'? Possibly it is.<br />
Thats something I'll have to deal with on my own, if my conscience bugs me about feeling this way.<br />
Do I feel bad for civilians in the middle east, hurt, killed or inconvenienced by our actions there? I sure do. But that doesn't mean I think we should stop.</div></div><hr />

Why not just drop the sanctions in exchange for a juicy oil deal?  <br />
<br />
NO WHEY SIR~~~~~!<br />
<br />
War was not specifically about oil but oil played a major part. Specifically, Saddam had decided to price oil in Euros, not Dollars. <br />
<br />
Our entire way of life is supported by the massive investment of forigen powers - $5 billion a day invested in the US. Thanks guys btw. :P<br />
<br />
You'll have to go to econonomic sites or crazy tinfoil hat sites for what would happen if the world Oil Market switched from a US-backed $ standard to a euro/pound/pp standard. But it would be VERY not good for us. <br />
<br />
By removing the need for people to have to buy dollars to buy his oil, Saddam gave us one hell of a gut shot. Thus he got his ass kicked. That war is only one of the reasons Bush is a traitor. <br />
<br />
I'm pissed bush is running anti-eduication, anti-environment, anti-freedom, anti-abortion, pro-religous government. *EVERY*body knows that 9/11 was just an excuse to smack down iraq. GO read the crap rummy, perle, and those other fucks have been saying for years. Neo-con fantasy land. Shit, even WSJ is *finally* sayin &quot;Hmmm.. they lied to us after 9/11.&quot; http://online.wsj.com/article_email/0,,SB107991342102561383-IJjgoNjlaF3oJ2rZnuIaKeBm4,00.html<br />
<br />
So the war in iraq was started using lies. Not &quot;I never touched the bitch&quot; lies, like serious anti-american anti-democratic lies. Bombing innocent people in iraq for 9/11 is a FUCKING WAR CRIME. &quot;but.. grim.. duh.. i gotts ta po-tect mah familie from them terrorists! blows them all up reeeel gud&quot; Fuck you. Just fuck you. You want to talk like war crimes are a viable means of policy, then we have nothing to discuss. <br />
<br />
And that shits bad but worse is that bush still isn't &quot;FIGHTING TERRORISM!&quot; They never were. Not even before the ruins stopped smokeing. <br />
<br />
WaPo:<br />
In the early days after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, the Bush White House cut by nearly two-thirds an emergency request for counterterrorism funds by the FBI, an internal administration budget document shows. <br />
<br />
The document, dated Oct. 12, 2001, shows that the FBI requested $1.5 billion in additional funds to enhance its counterterrorism efforts with the creation of 2,024 positions. But the White House Office of Management and Budget cut that request to $531 million. Attorney General John D. Ashcroft, working within the White House limits, cut the FBI's request for items such as computer networking and foreign language intercepts by half, cut a cyber-security request by three quarters and eliminated entirely a request for &quot;collaborative capabilities.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Way to fight terrorism buddy. :rolleyes: You know what's more fucked up? This bullshit with crap like the missle defence shield is diverting money and attention away from the real security issues. You know that they think the bombers in Spain got their stuff through the port there? And we aren't spending shit on port security.</div></div><hr />

No, it's the same reasoning that all the war hungry &quot;terrorism fighters&quot; are using.  Someone from the middle east bombed us... let's go to war with the middle east...<br />
<br />
Look, I wasn't talking directly about you, saying you were uneducated, or even blindly following, yourself.  But you have to admit as an American, that we are being shielded from lots of information, and not just confidential war information. <br />
<br />
You said it yourself... America as a whole is woefully mis-informed... and spouting off about us being in there for ONLY the right reasons (especially those bubblegum media reasons) are simply making us out to be the Euro-hating, Middle-east hating American stereotype that's going to make us an even more desirable target.<br />
<br />
If you want to make an ethical decision on this subject, I understand... and I can even understand if your ethical decision is different than mine.  But what bothers me most is that some (not necessarily yours) ethical decisions are based on all the reasons that our corrupt government and propaganda-ridden media tells us.<br />
<br />
&quot;We need to go in there for terrorism!&quot;  yet more and more information is coming out that shows Iraq has had little if any ties to Al Queda or Bin Laden.<br />
<br />
&quot;But he has Weapons of Mass Destruction!&quot; and Bush is going to be looking on Mars for them next.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we're freeing the poor Iraquis!&quot; and killing them too... but we don't see that on the media... in fact... when was the last time you saw ANY negative war images?</div></div><hr />
