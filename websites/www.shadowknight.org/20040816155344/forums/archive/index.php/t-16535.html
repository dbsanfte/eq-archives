<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Beasty1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wondered what the bare minimum was required for<br />
<br />
a) Taking the nameds in HoT<br />
b) Taking Dozekar himself<br />
<br />
Would like some firsthand knowledge, thanks much for info posted :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shaedii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Depends on who is doing it, but my guild regularly one groups the nameds as well as Doze.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Beasty1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Shae thats the kind of info I'm looking for, thanks.<br />
<br />
What kind of gear does your group use?  <br />
<br />
I checked out your magelo, so I assume the same kinda gear as that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shaedii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Pretty much. I'm probably the worst equippped of the group.<br />
<br />
It's all about just knowing the fight, just like everything else. I think when we first started doing Doze we had 2 groups, 8-9 people total. Now we do it with as few as 4-5 people.<br />
<br />
Although, when we first started none of us except the main tank even had VT keys, much less VT level gear. It's doable with a single group in SS/ornate armor if people know what they're doing.</div></div><hr />
