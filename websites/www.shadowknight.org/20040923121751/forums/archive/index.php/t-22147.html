<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Maicom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">was a recent change anyways, we lived before it was introduced, im sure we'll manage just fine now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Feriin Cydovu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">um just use it the instant you stand up ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>velourea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">how is this a &quot;CoS&quot; nerf? this is exactly how it used to be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I really liked casting casting to get up from FD.  It saved time when something bad happened like getting hit with a spell.  Did enough spell gem spammers cry about it that they changed it back?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Powa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i actually full time &quot;stand&quot; from FD before i cast any spell, so this doesn't affect me entirely~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zakton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">THis isn't just a CoS nerf, I am not able to cast anything while down from FD.  I liked being able to cast Death Peace from the ground but now it gives some message about I must be standing first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i prefer it this way. this way in situations where i'm blind or whatever i can just spam my hotkey and not repeatedly stand back up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Lynxal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">One thing that seemed to have changed recently....I couldn't use it with a pet up to lose the pet.  I used it the 5 minutes prior getting to where I wanted to be...then tried to use it after getting a pet up and it would not take hold until I dismissed the pet.  Anyone else see this or was this an odd bug?  I was going to try it with a post nerf CoS to see if the casting time made a difference but forgot to do so at the end of the night.  Haven't been on to try it again yet with the pre-nerf either.</div></div><hr />

<br />
so its good for CoM and Dragon Necropolis and...?   I would rather have the old way back because it saved half to a full sec when getting run down by sow speed mobs when I am trying to FD split them.  The ones I would like to see removed are the get up from sitting and autoduck when I hit a object.<br />
