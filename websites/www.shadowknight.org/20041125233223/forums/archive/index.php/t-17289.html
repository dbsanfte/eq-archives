<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Loneshadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">How would it be to implement a rage bar or something like that for pure melee classes. It would fill slowly while the character gets hit and will allow for some special attacks or abilities to be used at the cost of some or all of that bar. It could be used like mana is for spells but this would be melee based abillities with maybe some of the higher lvl ones having some magic component.<br />
<br />
For warriors some abillitie that would give them a 4xnormal weapon dmg attack, or something like a stuning blow or an abillitie that reduces dmg a little bit for a few ticks or gives them an aoe aggro. they would be able to train these abillities at certain lvls, getting stronger and more potent ones as they lvl up.<br />
<br />
This might just be a silly not well thought out idea, but the duscussion that ensued after that Steel Warriors post did get me thinking. such a ragebar idea with special abillities including extra aggro abillities would bring, for example warriors, closer to us without breaking the game and wel...make the warrior class more fun. It would also fill the roleplay aspect as the skills still depend on melee abillities and the weapons weilded. And since pure melee classes depend on their weapons so much let them be able to use special techniques with them.<br />
<br />
This idea is not original tho, its just something i remembered from an RPG :)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Darkreapyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">actually i like that idea, perhaps monks could get a 100% memwipe when full rage on fd or whatever  bringing them up to par with bards Fading memories. Warriors something like increased dmg/procs/aggro. Rogs i have no idea besides more dmg/procs</div></div><hr />

<br />
All of which will mean jack shit if the warrior can't get and/or hold agro to GET hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Loneshadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah. but thats just because people are to lazy now a days to keep their finger of the nuke button for two seconds and the difference in endurence between warriors and knights is not that big that a warrior tank is able to take that much more punishment that they are the preferred tank...<br />
<br />
Thats why i thought that would be a nice adjustment to warriors to make the advantages of warrior-tanks more visable...but then again...its other people that need adjustments in attitude.<br />
<br />
This game doesnt work as intended anymore...sk are finally usefull but many other classes are just to overpowered. Lot of nuking=lot of aggro, people dont want to hold back for one second anymore so they just get an sk tank..Im almost thinkin that sk aggro should be nerfed to hell same with pally aggro just so people will be forced once again to think about what they do../sigh<br />
<br />
bah gettin off topic, this was about the special abillities for melees :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The thing is, it's not trigger happy wizards and mages that are the problem. It's shaman and enchanters just trying to do their job. In many of the planes with lesser gear(read: what you can buy in the bazaar for less than a million plat), the group with a warrior has three choices.<br />
<br />
A: They can let the warrior die/suck up cleric mana waiting the 8-10 seconds needed to establish enough aggro to tash/malo and then slow, praying for him to proc.<br />
<br />
B: They can slow on inc, pray for the 50/50 success rate of taunt on blue mobs, and if it fails, the slower dies/sucks up cleric mana. Let's not even think about slow resists right now.<br />
<br />
C: Boot the warrior, find a knight. This shouldn't be the preferred option. Any one of the three plate tanks should be able to stand at the front of a mob in a exp grind group and perform adequately, and have thier own unique advantages.<br />
<br />
We are seeing the other side of mudflation here: to make things a challenge for the folks who are coming in with the last wave of gear, mobs must hit harder and faster. Beginning in Valor/Storms, mobs start to toe the line where the innate durability warriors have over knights is completely overshadowed by knight snap aggro. In BoT, nameds and their placeholders, the kriegers, are probably capable of one rounding a non-raiding enchanter. I haven't been to elementals, but the one hard mode dungeon I attempted was pushing the utter limits of what I can tank as a NToV/early Ssra level SK. Our first pull was four mobs, I was only able to lock down 2, and our cleric literally died in less than the cast time of Divine Barrier when she eventually drew aggro from chain remedying the enchanter. It was incredibly frustrating, and I can only begin to imagine how much it must piss a warrior off to see this happen time and time again on single pulls.</div></div><hr />

Make everybody take an IQ test, and if you can't get higher than a 50, you don't get to play EQ anymore. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Loneshadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">hehe, yeah i know Arath, just got a bit frustrated cause of another LDoN group a few secs earlier.. :P<br />
<br />
But as i said there is already something broken in this game, the NEED for slow on every mob is somewhat stupid..they should have tought of other ways to make encounters more challenging then needing a shm or enc to slow a damn mob wich in turn needs an sk tank or the slower dies on every mob../sigh...dilemmas dilemmas...<br />
<br />
Hehe, but that ragebar idea is what this thread is about and was tought up as more of a way of how id like to see warriors and other pure melees become more fun.<br />
<br />
Hehe, and thumbs up bout that IQ test, tho that would flood the game with shadowknights :P ...<br />

btw, that absor quote: Classes are not that out of balance..well its not that untrue..its the rest of the game thats broken hehe :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Silence</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">that is actually a pretty good idea for pure melees, and it wouldnt be that hard to implement...  make it a class AA for pure melees,  and  then put some of the abilities in the PoP aa's unlockable after getting  &quot;rage bar&quot; have it cost like 6aa's  and make each ability   ( lets say 3 for each)  <br />
<br />
the rage bar would ' fill'  by each successful hit (1-2 pts building up to 500 pts or so with a 5-10 minute reuse time)  or each time a mob hits you (3-5 pts )  <br />
<br />
warrior -  <br />
<br />
Vengeful Fury ( 3 aa's per lvl)  Creates an aura around the warrior powering his attacks with a vengeful fury ( each hit gives 200 pts of aggro for lets say 3-5-8 seconds )    might have to change the aggro number around but something like that<br />
<br />
Bolstered Defense (3 aas per lvl)  Hardens the warriors armor ( for 10-15-20 seconds allows the warrior to mitigate more damage) <br />
<br />
Chaos Blade ( 3 aa's per lvl)  Turns the warriors blades into Chaos Blades allowing him to do double damage with his weapons  ( 10 15 20 seconds) <br />
<br />
Monks- <br />
<br />
Inner Peace ( 3 aa's per level)  allows the monk to slow his heart rate to the point of near death ( 10 -15 -25% chance of  losing aggro completely)  <br />
<br />
Dragon Kick (3 aas per lvl)  gives the monk a chance to perform a Dragon kick  ( flying kick x 3 dmg  or something  10-15 -25% chance that next kick will be Dragon Kick)<br />
<br />
Whirlwind Fists ( 3 aa's per lvl) with complete focus the monk can make his / her fists move with the speed of a whirlwind ( haste like the ranger guardian of the forest aa that stacks with their epic for 10-15-25 seconds) <br />
<br />
Rogue- <br />
<br />
Assassins Blade (3 aa's per lvl) allows the assassin to pinpoint  weak points in his / her enemy for maximum damage  ( 5-10-15% increase in BS dmg for 20 seconds {bout 2 BSes} ) <br />
<br />
Blinding Speed ( 3 aa's per lvl ) makes the bandits hands move with blinding speed ( haste like GoF aa stacks with hastes  10-15-25 seconds) <br />
<br />
Twin Stabs ( 6 aa's ) allows the rogue to backstab  with both hands for 20 seconds  ( technically giving them a chance for a quad BS this one might be reaching  but i ran out of ideas ) <br />
<br />
<br />
i think something like this ( and this is just a general idea ) would be good for the said classes, it'd give them special skills no other classes could have and keep them in line without completely over powering them</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Drakonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Anything that makes meleeing more fun than /autoattack on, and the occasional /bash = good plan...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Darkreapyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Those are very nice although i would like to see more than 25% on monk fd cause 2 classes already have 100% rog/bard<br />
<br />
Hopefully the warriors &quot;rage&quot; bar or whatever would refresh enough where it makes it reliable in exp groups but still just a tad under sk/pally aggro<br />
<br />
but i doubt any of this will make it to the ear of a dev or will they actually use it</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Morgrist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Stamina draining special attacks/effects.<br />
 <br />
And have mana increasers on gear = stamina point increases as well. Warriors now benefit from the LDoN and other gear that is made for all plate classes.<br />
 <br />
Nerf stamina recovery spells accordingly.<br />
 <br />
Problem solved. Warrior special tricks can have delay bars(Furor winds up for a mighty blow!) recovery neg buff effects(crap, move stun wear off please, gawdammit exhaustion agi loss...!), etc, limiting weapon factors, whatever.<br />
 <br />
And yes, cool graphics. Monks get em. Why not warriors?<br />
<br />
It's literally that fucking simple. Warriors could build snap aggro with some sort of &quot;rapid-fire attack barrage with a low-delay weapon skill&quot; (and promptly burn out STA and exhaust neg buff into a slower attack speed if they overdid it) and all sorts of other melee tricks. <br />
 <br />
It's weird- all the funky stuff knights get and warriors get jack diddly for unique techinques and the like the entire time. All it'd have taken was using the Useless Yellow Bar.<br />
<br />
No new &quot;rage&quot; bar. No funky AA's. Just a little reworking of the spell/mana coding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Silence</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">sure that does sound easy... but then they' d have to put a lvl requirement / skill setting  on each thing and add those to the tables and add all of that into the coding so that the skill takes away from stamina bar.  <br />
<br />
do you really think itd be easier for them to do all the things you said or add  a few aa's?  using the aa's to add the rage bar would save soe from having to go back into the old code and change a buncha things... its easier to add new than to change old.  but it is another way they can do it... if they actually see this they'll have 2 ways to fix it  we'll see if that happens heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Morgrist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Um...not nearly as hard as it'd seem.<br />
 <br />
A lot of it would be real simple. Use the spell coding, having it cost stamina instead of mana, make it difficult if damn near impossible to interrupt. Tweaking the stamina boosts is child's play. The only potentially tough part would be making mana boosts on equipment = stamina boosts for a warrior.<br />
 <br />
Level requirements? No problem. You're just using a coding set in the game and bending it so it uses a new bar and generates effects according to whatever you like.  There's coding to get crits, AE effects/rampage, increased haste, whatever. Limiters on weapons choices and the like are doable too- after all, the game has proven quite able to code abilities based on requirements of that sort. It's a workable and potentially revolutionary change to the warrior,and one that's been needed for a while. Hybrids can do pretty much anything BUT /disc defensive. Warriors by comparison get jack shit.<br />
<br />
Shit,I'm oldschool MMORPG warrior, as in Diku MUDs and Gemstone III. I took a hybrid because EQ warriors are LAME by comparison to GS III ones...I was so used to having useful options and tricks that I tried a warrior here and couldn't stomach it. <br />
 <br />
It's like watching your younger brother with an IQ of 35 and knowing you could perform a surgery that would let him go to Harvard instead, but didn't. <br />
<br />
All for the use of the Useless Yellow Bar. Which even a level 1 Warrior gets.<br />
 <br />
Fuck,we get class defining abilities at 9th or 15th as hybrids (depending on if you're a pallie or SK) with our spells. For a warrior, it's... /disc defensive. And maybe /shield occasionally. That's about it.<br />
<br />
It's a change that would give the warriors options. Options mean better play for the class. <br />
 <br />
Could you imagine a warrior that could solo even somewhat as effectively as we do? Or do stuff that went beyond one-dimensional play?<br />
 <br />
I can and it doesn't involve level 50+ warriors pumping AA's. It starts at the same point the other plate meleers get up and start running...down at the lower levels.</div></div><hr />

do you really think itd be easier for them to do all the things you said or add  a few aa's? <br />
You don't fix classes with AA's or items.<br />
<br />
Class balance is in innate skills and spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Silence</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">the problem with warriors doesnt start at lvl 1, hell you barely notice it until they start getting to a raiding lvl... 46+ ish why the hell not make it an AA?   the problem the warriors are concerned with is groups at the high lvl range...  not the low lvl range giving them  the fixes  i proposed or something near em  would be retarded at lvl 1....   they dont need a boost  before that... <br />
<br />
as for AAs not being class defining...  what part of alternate abilities... makes it non class defining? if anything... it boosts the pre defined class roles...  <br />
<br />
rogues with SoS  monks with rapid feign warriors with  flurries and ae taunt ...   those dont help define the class?  what kind of retarded logic is that?  <br />
<br />
i can see not making the Rage bar an AA... just giving it to them at 51,  i can see coding it to where + mana items benefit  the pure melee in some way  but changing it to use the stamina bar and converting mana to stamina is just stupid  it'll create more problems because  if you havent noticed...  stamina drops when you fight...  why change the stamina bar JUST for them? and  what are the odds they dont fuck it up and all of us lose the + mana to our stamina bar without the effects  the pure melees get cuz i can see that happening <br />
<br />
making it an AA is the easiest way to do it without having to go back and change a shitload of old coding  and risking breaking every class...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Morgrist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Actually, the problems with warriors start around 9th and go rapidly downhill soon enough.<br />
 <br />
We get better at doing more and more from there.<br />
 <br />
Warriors become worse. It's a disparity that grows over time. By 35-40, most warriors are getting in serious trouble doing more than tank for group.<br />
 <br />
By 40+ they're stuck in it. Look at what you as an SK can do by that point. Compare to warriors.<br />
 <br />
Leveling up should give more things you can do as a class-not less. By 30th, we're able to all manner of useful things in a party.<br />
 <br />
By 30th, most warriors are dependant on one and can do only one thing. Tank. And not as well as a paladin/SK of the same level due to aggro issues.<br />
 <br />
We stopped looking at knights as warrior + necro a long time ago and became something unique. Paladins did the same. We're plate melee classes now, both of us. So are warriors- only they don't get to do a quarter of what we do for the trade of marginal attack and AC advantages.<br />
 <br />
They're the weak brother of the three plate melee classes. From the bottom down, something needs to be done to make them able to serve in a unique way so that people stop scorning them as second-rate plate.</div></div><hr />
