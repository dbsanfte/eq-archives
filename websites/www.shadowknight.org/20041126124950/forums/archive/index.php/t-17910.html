<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mahb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Good day my Dark Hearted Brethern,<br />
<br />
  I'm a pre kunark age Shadow Knight born on Karrana and now walking the lands of maelin. I have traveled in strong guilds since the age of 45th lvl and now find myself roaming new lands in the company of one. I benifit from a strong spell book, powerful equipment, and the knowlege of many battles past.<br />
 Brothers and sisters my question to you is this ,what's a Shadow Knight to do now that she finds herself lusting for blood with no guild to call home ? <br />
 Is soloing a viable option considering time vs xp reward ? Are the dungeons the answer ?<br />
<br />
  Entering a guild again does not enthrall this seasoned adventure, as many a gods blood has been spilt, and all thats left would be group politics and it's frivolous distractions from battle and conquest.<br />
 There is still much to build up on this old dark hearted bag of bones. Grim armor has yet to be attained, as well as AA's , but can one go about doing that alone,and at a pace that can out race a crippled slugg ?<br />
  May Hate seeth in your Darkest of hearts and coarce your veins! Keep your enemies on your sword tip's,and may the gods bow befor you.<br />

Reread what you posted, if I understand you're asking if going without a guild is a viable way to play.  If so I will give you and answer, if not sorry for wasting your time.  From all the years that I've played this game, you've always needed a group or friends to depend on.  This game is after all social.  I have a lot of high level friends that are unguilded, but they still play in pickup groups or with a group that they've been playing with since they started.  Basically, what draws you to the game?  Do you mind pickup groups or have a bunch of regulars you play with?  Soloing seems to be boring and not as worth it as finding a group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Taeluuan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have to agree with itchy. I have a 53 druid i avoid playing like the plague because groups are hard to find. You need to define your goals for EQ ie do you want to be elemental or stop at tier3. Guilds can be frustrating at times, but after a while you learn to ignore the trash they /guildremove fast enough anyway. My suggestion to you would be take some time away from guilds. Group with people get to know them and ask what their guild is like. If by chance they say its a high end raiding guild stay away from it. Get into a not so uber guild, it may sound strange but they are the closest knit. Uber guilds have to much politics and way to much drama. I personally like my guild a good bit. only 100 or so people mid to almost high lol and very social. The smiles are why i play EQ and it seems i get more form my friends then from a mob. Take what you want from this if it helps glad to help if not good luck to ya anywho</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Judithe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This might sound a bit weird but if I were you I would delevel to 60 and then solo away at your AA.  Soloing is still slower than grouping overall but if you include all the time you spend getting a group and all of those times that you end up in a bad group(the kind that get you killed or waste your time) it is not that much worse.  I spend about 10 minutes every 3-4 hours getting another KEI and the rest of my time is spent solo-killing.<br />
<br />
I do nothing but solo and am dreading the day I decide to ding 61.  I've tried guilds and I've tried pick up groups and neither one are any fun for me.<br />
<br />
If however, you are more than just slightly into 61 this might not be an option you would like.  In that case you are basically stuck with pickup groups for the rest of your career.  Either that or start pet kiting which to me seems like the exact opposite of fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aoninie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I agree with Tael. Find a nice, small, casual play guild. I amin one with around 150 members (to include alts). We are very tight and group all the time. Average lvl is in the mid 50's of the people that regularly group. We do LDON together, the plains, and epic mobs. The epic mobs can be a bit of a problem in a small guild but we have allied with other small guilds to accomplish these tasks. If you are on the Zeb server you sound like you would fit right into our guild. A friend of mine is in an uber guild and it just sounds aweful to me. She has manadory farming and mandatory raids. Last I remember this is a game and ment to be fun. Do some research and find a guild that will suit you. But most of all have fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bonebreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Maelins Guild Scene is way different than the other servers.<br />
<br />
I moved from Prexus and it is like night and day.<br />
<br />
On Maelin ya have 5 or 6 Uber guilds and a couple mid range Guilds and then the rest.<br />
<br />
Uber Guilds-Have to be VT Keyed and mostly Time able and even then they aren't really recruiting.<br />
<br />
Mid Guilds- Want to become uber so if ya can't raid 5 times a week minimum forget it.<br />
<br />
The Others-1 or 2 ok Guilds but I never see them doing much Raid wise. Maybe they group but if they don't, then you back where ya started.<br />
<br />
Here is what I do. Aggro Kite in PoJ, Gaolers, and some Sentries if bored. Use best pet, you will NOT get ANY Adds. You can do this until 65 (I did with Necro altho I added HG's). Just Fester and load up all your dots, sick pet (taunt off) and med in corners until mob dead, rinse,repeat.<br />
<br />
Also can Fear Kite Flies in PoD but can be pain if a Bard or Wizzie pops in.<br />
<br />
Velks can be good if ya have desent gear and can toe to toe Spiders.<br />
<br />
See ya around Mahb.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mahb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Wellp I'm pritty transparent =) You guys understood my problem better than I did !!  I was in one of those uber guilds on mae for over 2 years &lt;moved to mae from karanna with them&gt; but as you said they went turbo on pot and I had to work, so basicly I went thud like a spud ;) <br />
 I spent some time in one of those up starts, rigid, but they went belly up faster than a gold fish in amonia , oh and did I tell you all they disbanded the day I was up for ara and the st key. The humanity !!<br />
  I will take that advice and stroll between Velks, DN, and Poj. Most of my freinds are all guilded and unfortunatly keep the air they breath in a zip lock baggy, so they can stay on the go hehe.<br />
 I geuss the only reason I want to go elemental is for grim armor. Wepon wise I'm ok( defiler, blade of honar,and nirandi's), armor is pritty much ok as well &lt; I'm close to 5k+ hp and 1400+ ac&gt; but being a dark hearted wench it's hard too stop untill my inventory slut says tilt !! I dont want you to infer I'm a loot hore, I'm just as happy seeing good stuff go to good people other than me ;) It's just I beleave you show me an SK that doesn't care about up grades, and I'll show you an SK with no heart. This has been my main since my 1st birthday, and I just could never picture careing and enjoying a class as much as I do this bast*rd child of Inny :D <br />
    Pardon the diatribe, May the Gods shine upon all of thee, and may your coffers over flow with bounty. Great advice and I'll take it !!  Be cool BoneBreak, and you pritty much sumed up Mae for me, it is really just a 2 horce town lol. Hope to see you in game, and fair thee well where ever yhe fair dark brother !! Keep'em at a swords tip !!<br />
