<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>VengerMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">does anyone have any advice on the 3rd sewer?  so far we have continually wiped when exiting the water.  we clear our way to the water every time with little trouble, then invis and swim past all of the turtles and slimes.  on the other end of the swim there is a stair rising out of the water, with a spirit at the top who sees invis.<br />
<br />
every time we make it to this point we get swarmed with adds on those steps.  hoping someone can offer some input on how to get past this point, as it seems to be a bottleneck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Daerkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This is pretty easy actually. Invis through the water and then exit the water to the right of the stairs. There is a static mob on each side of the stairs. As you face the stairs back up one mob from the static mob to the right of stairs, you are on a narrow platform just under the water. If you basically stand on top of that mob before you break invis and engage you wont get any adds. Kill that mob and the one behind you, then pull the stair mobs and the wanderers one by one until you have them all. This takes a little time, but there is no risk as respawn is very long. I have done this multiple times on my own boxxing a group of 4 while farming the Blistering Larvae. After the wandering mobs are removed all of the remaining mobs are easily dispatched.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Treznor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">you could also just fight your way thru the pool, so you dont get swamped when you come up to the see invis mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>cauchy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Haha, I know the exact spot you're talking about.  Break from the top sort of circle ledge thing.  Your feet will still be underwater, which is a problem for mosquitos if there are any since you'll have that whole stupid water/land spell casting problem.  Anyway, breaking from the top is pretty easy, just single the turtles around the wall then work your magic on the stairs.  You'll have to fight mosquitos on the stairs, but by the time you're pulling them, it should be semi-safe to do so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>VengerMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i went with Daerkon's suggestion, worked absolutely great.  lol, once you are on that ledge and can look around it is obvious that it is a good spot to work from.  when you are underwater, and everything is dark and gloomy, it is not quite so easy to spot that safe area, heh.<br />
<br />
still no luck with the Pockmarked Aegis dropping, but now that we have the strat down for the trial i'll get my hands on one sooner or later.</div></div><hr />
