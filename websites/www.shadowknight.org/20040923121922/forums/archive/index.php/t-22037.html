<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vholj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was going to bow to experience here, and ask you all a question in regards to a Mob inside of Chardok, a creature named Battle Master Ska`Tu.<br />
<br />
I have heard rumors that he no longer spawns, that he was taken out of the game.  Not sure if this was true, and cannot see any documentation of it, but I was wondering if you knew anything of this.  He had a cool toy, the Shai`Din Revenant Bauble, and a rare spell, Shroud of Undeath, I believe.  Screw the spell, as I do not plan on getting it, and care not about it.  However, the Bauble, if this Mob was removed from EQ&lt; has it then raised in price?   I remember it going for 2-3k in Bazaar about 6 months ago, when I used to play, but since I came back to EQ, I have seen very few for sale at all.  One seller claimed that it was quite rare now, as the Mov\b that drops it no longer spawns.  Mainly, I am asking if that fellow was trying to scam me, or is it actually a rare item now, and is it worth more than it used to?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any info you might have.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>tearsin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">well, i was not able to absolutely confirm by a positive yes or no...<br />
but my investigation led me to discover that, at the very least, the guy still spawned as of january of this year. and i don't recall there being any chardok patches since then, or having heard anything about spawn adjustments.<br />
<br />
the bauble is rare now mostly because chardok doesn't get farmed very often anymore... the items that necros/druids would farm from chardok (hence their high availability) have scaled down in value so much most people just don't bother going anymore.<br />
<br />
so, it's likely going to be rarer to find then you may have seen before, but it should still be dropping</div></div><hr />

I always thought it was kinda crappy so never bothered to confirm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nastard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">As of about 4 weeks ago, the bauble still drops. Got one screwing around during a royals &quot;raid.&quot; As for the spell, I'm not sure if it still drops. I bought a copy in the bazaar for 500pp a few weeks before they changed skeleton graphics. For several weeks after the change, shroud of undeath was still showing the old graphic, which I thought was cool if for nothing else then getting people to ask how I was using the old models. They eventually remembered the spell existed and updated the graphic =[</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vholj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the info all.  It seems then, that I was approached by a scammer.  Ah well, what are you gonna do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Oagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">He was there a couple weeks ago.  Make sure you clear around him if possible, otherwise he'll bring friends.</div></div><hr />

The spell hes referring to has 2 versions. The vendor purchased version has the usual proc nonsense, but is rather mundane. The dropped version has a skeletal form illusion tacked on, and makes the spell rather worthwhile, its one of the few ways that a young Sk can make himself a skeleton (barring an AoN).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Feriin Cydovu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I wasn't talking about the spell.<br />
<br />
Also Skeleton Illusion is lame, wish I never scribed that spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Greylin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Bauble is also a random drop in Chardok2 (as are most of the Chardok 1 drops).  My guild does Korocust about once a week - we probably get a Bauble every other week (clearing only to Koro).</div></div><hr />
