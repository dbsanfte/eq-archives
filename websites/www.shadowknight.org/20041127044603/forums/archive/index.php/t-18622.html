<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ganaith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Alright, if i am correct capt bvellos is the one to deliver coldain heads to for pos KT hits. I am allied now with kromriff due to giving the recruiter at entrance dozens of heads, and my apocalypse upon the lands of the coldain lately. However, i am still scowling to the kromzek, making me turning the heads in to bvellos a sheer impossible task.<br />
<br />
questions:<br />
<br />
1) can bvellos be charmed, and if so, can i give him the coldain hits for faction hits?<br />
<br />
2) do mobs in skyshrine indeed give more facton hits to kromzek? I am nearly positive they should, but Soe is never truly logical. <br />
<br />
3) if the mobs in SS give more zek faction, is it wise to massacre SS? or better keep killing coldain to stack on the heads and hopefully hit dubious?<br />
<br />
4) how large are the zek hits for killing WW dragons? interesting or not?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sithanator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes the mob mobs in SS give kromzek hits, however since revamp those hits are now unbelievely small. For getting non kos to zek your best bet is to solo coldain in gd/ew or getting acouple friends to hit icewall or WW with you. Another thing you can try is walk over to bvellos invis hit hide as your opening the trade window, but this is slow and often resualt in some fun trains. However between vendor food and coin it's fairly decent loot in SS, better then off coldain(excluding heads).<br />

<br />
You get a lot of velium in SS.  I make so much there compared to farming heads<br />
<br />
/hijack off<br />
<br />
I still get to min non kos to zek by killing in SS, then switch back to dorf killing to get heads and turnin into capt bvelious.  Tormax faction is a pain to get compared to zek =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sabazios</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">just turn in heads to bvellos, the easy way to do it is this:<br />
1. Have a bard or druid harmony the mob<br />
2. Go up to Bvellos, open up a trade window w. him<br />
3. Have bard cast the invis song, or druid cast invis on you<br />
4. Check con. (should be indifferent) and then hit trade.<br />
5. Go to step 1</div></div><hr />
