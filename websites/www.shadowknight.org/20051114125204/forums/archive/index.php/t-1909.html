<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Agoni</div><div class="date">05-24-2002, 09:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do I think the Chardok faction and subsequent quests are worth the hard work needed to reap the rewards...Yes!  I began in a round about way by hunting in Droga at 33rd level with a full group.  My motivation was simple...exp and nice loot.  I wanted an Idol of the Thorned, Earring of Essence and Stone of Morrid (I have all three).  Well shortly after I started hunting here i found the quests and quickly reached ally.  In fact I was ally before I was high enough level to get the reward for the first quest.  Being able to bank in chardok, buy and sell in chardok, receive the quest rewards and on occassion help out friends with nasty CR's deep inside or on Royals raids has made the many guelling hours in Droga very much worth it.  Unfortunately I am back down to amiably due to my Greenmist quest (funny ya slaughter the royal family just once and whammo no more ally ;p).  I will be getting my faction back to ally for Warlord Skargus.  However he is constantly killed on my server as soon as the angry goblin pops.  I watched a group take him down once with a Wizzy, Warrior and a Rogue all 55+ hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

Would be kinda tough to solo since you can't fear kite.  He is slowable and was a pretty easy kill duo with a shaman friend.</div></div><hr />

skargus is a pushover, I duo'd him with a druid partner (both 60).</div></div><hr />
