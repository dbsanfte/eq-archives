<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>BludrainHalovex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Got bored yesterday and figured &quot;why not knock off a few goody goody guards from the good side of lavastorm&quot;... and wouldn't you know it, they're easily killed, and give positive dark reign faction along with a few others.  I'm not sure how big the faction hit is because when I was done clearing the guards I was still apprehensive but its still an alternate way of getting faction none the less.<br />
<br />
The reason I posted this in the combat/tactics forums though is this... as I'm sure many of you noticed if you got aggro on them, their pathing is to say the least odd.  Run them far enough away from their standing point and they'll warp back to their starting point... aggro cleared... and fully cured of whatever you landed on them when they were hauling ass after you.  But the trick is so simple its almost dimwitted.  Just snare one and wait outside their running range.  When the unsnared guards warp back, the snared one will still be on its way and you can engage it before it warps back.  No need to worry about the other guards as they'll have forgotten you.<br />
<br />
They hit in the max range of 450-500 so this isn't a trick for everybody obviously, just thought it was kind of interesting that they did this when faction seems so important.</div></div><hr />
