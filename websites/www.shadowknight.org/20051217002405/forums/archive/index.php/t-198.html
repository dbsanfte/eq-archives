<br />
Until tonight...<br />
<br />
So I petitioned again, and a GM gave me a theory that he had and I'll pass it on to my Dark Reaver breatheren...<br />
<br />
His theory was that when you've been logged into EQ for over 3 hours (give or take) that the bugs start happening again. His advice was for me to log to the desktop, and come back in. When I did, I had no more problems...<br />
<br />
Hopefully this isn't an indication of what we'll have to do (3 hours! MARK... SKs / Necros and Monks log out now please). But at least it means that the people in charge are aware of problems...<br />
<br />
Just thought I'd share...<br />
<br />
-- Mr. Ghob Johnson<br />
<br />
PS.<br />
The theory covered both FD and Mend, but that's a skill that the skinny FDers get. (No offense to you non-fatties...) ;)</div></div><hr />
