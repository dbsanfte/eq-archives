Does a successfull 'taunt' check lower aggro (or position in hate list) of others? <br />
Lower other's aggro; no.  Lower their position on hate list; sometimes, but it's relative.<br />
<br />
A successful taunt puts you on top of the hate list by one point of aggro.<br />
<br />
Say there's a warrior and sk in the same group, with 2dps and 2 support people.  SK grabs initial aggro, hate list could look like this:<br />
<br />
1. SK<br />
2. Shaman<br />
3. Ranger<br />
4. Warrior<br />
5. Wizard<br />
6. Cleric<br />
<br />
Warrior taunts:<br />
<br />
1. Warrior<br />
2. SK<br />
3. Shaman<br />
4. Ranger<br />
5. Wizard<br />
6. Cleric<br />
<br />
So in that scenario, a successful taunt did lower relative positions on the hate list, but it didn't actually lower anyone's aggro.  Make sense?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SkTyger</div><div class="date">02-13-2004, 01:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Correct, that part I understood...<br />
<br />
However, I thought I remember a post/thread a LONG time ago, that taunt actually did two things:<br />
- If successful, put you at x+(small amount) of aggro to put you at head of hate list<br />
- Reduce everybody else on the aggro by some amount<br />
<br />
Was an old post, and now that I think about it, I guess it couldn't really do the 'reduce everybody'  (i.e. on raids, could get insane that way)<br />
<br />
Anyways, the thread this came from had stated that this was one of the reasons you didn't want to have more then 1 tank taunting at the same time (in that every successful check while make the gap between the ones holding the aggro and everybody else more narrow, i.e. such that there isn't that much of a difference anymore between the aggro on the MT and everybody else, ending up with the mob going for the Cleric healing, or the Wizard nuking, more easily).<br />
<br />
(Post even talked about the message from taunt in that it says something to the effect of you have taunted the monster to focus on you AND ignore everybody else, something like that)<br />
<br />
But this was a very very old post/thread I am trying to find, and this might have just been one of the EQ miss-truths (i.e. drop your Charisma to make Fear work better)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oagan</div><div class="date">02-13-2004, 03:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, Mathas is correct on effects of taunt.  It can instantly put you at the top if it is successful, hence it's usefullness.  However, other high dps classes can quickly take it back if they don't control their aggro.<br />
<br />
That's why CD and Fear work so well.  It takes a shitload of dps to overcome the aggro generation of those.  When we tank, we use the taunt button just like a warrior does when it pops up.  However, keeping CD/Fear tossed in allows the real damage dealers to go full bore, and that means a mob is dead real quick, and the healers only have to worry about healing one person.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Talonmare</div><div class="date">02-20-2004, 09:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also keep in mind that when the warrior taunts, he now has your exact hate +1... meaning if you smack the mob again before he does, you will now once again have more hate and he will come back to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pazuzu</div><div class="date">05-23-2004, 01:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you have tons of aggro on a mob...and you taunt sucessfully...do you actually reduce the amount of agrro you have to be 1 higher than the next lowest guy.   If you keep on taunting can you actually be hurting yourself?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khat</div><div class="date">05-23-2004, 01:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Successful Taunt = highest Hate +1.<br />
Supposing you are highest on the hate list throughout the fight, all you are doing when mashing Taunt is adding 1 point to the Hate list; effectively just bringing yourself up one point each time.<br />
<br />
While doing this, everyone else would potentially be generating more hate based on what they are doing, closing the gap.  As an example, they may be gaining 700 hate each time they cast a spell but you are only gaining 1 every time you Taunt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pazuzu</div><div class="date">05-27-2004, 04:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If I have 700 hate and the next lowest guy is 300.<br />
<br />
I make a successfyl taunt do i go to 701 hate or 301 hate?</div></div><hr />

Khat said, &quot;Successful Taunt = highest Hate +1.&quot;<br />
<br />
If you have 700 and successfully taunt, how could you go to 301 when the highest hate is 700?<br />
