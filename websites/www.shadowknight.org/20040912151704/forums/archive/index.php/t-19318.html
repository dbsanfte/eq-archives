<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've learned here (and used faitfully) tips for controlling agro depending on the situation.<br />
<br />
Of course the one thing I use most often is CD, and to great effect.<br />
<br />
About a month ago I was lowest level member of a CD group, and they wanted me to MA while a bard pulled.<br />
<br />
The Bard pulled with a slow/snare song.  When I cast CD I got the &quot;You're spell would not take hold&quot; message.<br />
<br />
The weird thing is that the Mobs never blinked at me, even as I'm beating on him.<br />
<br />
After a little experimentation I find a heat blood/terror combo works great if I get close when I cast the terror.<br />
<br />
I know CD generates nice agro even if resisted, does it generate the same agro if it does not take hold?<br />
<br />
Will it gernerate the same agro if I get the  - this MOB cannot be effected by spells that effect it's movement rate message?<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />

Just to make sure I'm not an idiot.....<br />
<br />
What I got out of that thread was that when you get the &quot;Your spell does not take hold&quot; message you still get agro.  <br />
In fact almost as much as if it did hold, but the agro is much more proximity sensitive than if the spell had taken hold.  <br />
So if I know my spell will not take hold, but I still want to be mana efficient, still cast clinging just use the same rules as when casting the terror line as far as proximity.<br />
<br />
I'll assume I undestood it properly, but correct me if I am wrong or unclear.</div></div><hr />
