<br />
From the posts I read while lurking I started at -1000 (of the -2000 to +2000 value range for faction) and currently made it up to Glaring with the Troopers via the Bandit lake area for almost 3 levels.  I have approximately 425 positive hits (almost 400 are from exiled Iksar) with the Legion.<br />
<br />
What I'm looking for is a scale or an index of the numerical values for faction.  Ie. -2000 to -700 is scowling, -699 to -? is glaring, etc...<br />
<br />
Any help?<br />

So far only 4 backpacks or bonechips stashed though. =\  Still need almost 5.6k more of 'em.  Thank for the link and I (hopefully) will be in Cabilis in another 3 weeks or so.<br />

Thanks again and best of luck to everyone!!<br />

Come back later if you must.  The explorers give Legion faction while killing em, and the knives are worth it by a long shot.<br />
<br />
If you can convince an evil race in LOIO to help you, settle down for a decent camp.  Spawn is fast, and mobs drop ringmail/rare locket and fair coin for level.  The knives are gold though :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binnib</div><div class="date">05-23-2002, 03:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Attyla, that's partially why I'm in Upper Guk right now.  Decent to good exp solo'ing and a few camps there.  I'm going to need to kill the exiled iksar to get my Necro Faction up anyway, so why not use them to raise Legion faction.<br />
<br />
Anyone got an accurate level on the explorers?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Attyla</div><div class="date">05-24-2002, 12:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Illia's says they are 29, but that's WAY off.  My lvl 39 (lvl 20 necro) pet can nearly solo one unbuffed.  They have around 5-600 hps or so.  They hit for mid 30s maximum.   Given that, I'd expect them to be around lvl 19-22.  The Lead Explorers are a bit higher -- around 700 hps, so probably closer to 24 and are paladins, so they will LoH.<br />
<br />
I'd say by 25, you should be able to solo them, if you can break them up.  They've been reported as pretty easy for their /con.  Were I you, I'd set up shop in Lake of Ill Omen and do pick up groups there till then, and if you happen to see a higher level evil in zone, maybe they'll break the spawn for you.  I think at 25, you'd have a hard time keeping up with the spawn solo but could probably keep half the area cleared.  If you can get a partner to help out you should have little problems with clearing it.<br />
<br />
Also, the explorers are KoS to cats/skeletons/goblins.  Often one will roam into aggro range and when they run, pull explorers away from the tower.  If you have a hard time pulling singles, you can often find some of them standing outside for a while after killing a hostile mob.<br />
<br />
There are quite a few wandering high teens around the explorer tower (undead/Iksar/goblins/cats).  So plenty of mobs to keep you and a mate occupied at that level.  They are easily avoided if you are remotely aware of your surroundings.<br />
<br />
Can't speak to the xp rendered when turning  in the sets of 4 knives.  At 48, I didn't even notice it.<br />
<br />
In addition, killing the explorers/gobs and Iksar will give you Legions faction.  In the course of obtaining 5-6 stacks of knives, you should become Dubious to Trooper Vaurk without needing to work over no xp green mobs.  Once dubious, you can turn the knives in.<br />
<br />
If getting Cab faction is a high priority for you, you can fix it in the course of xping in your mid 20s.  And if you do the LoIO thing (which I don't typically advise, but in this case I would), you can power thru your 20s and if opportunity presents, have your cab faction completed save BroodofKotiz.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binnib</div><div class="date">05-25-2002, 10:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I never liked the Loio concept of leveling in ~4 hours.  Gets old fast usually (maybe it's just I tried to keep my Rogue on Mainland until 34).  Odds are I will end up being 24 or 25 when I head back to Kunark.  <br />
<br />
I almost have my faction with The Legion and BoK up to dubious so I'm planning to finish that and then try the Explorer Knifes.<br />
<br />
What faction is needed for the Khukri series anyway?  I thought it was Amiable but the Monk Guild only needs indifferent.<br />
