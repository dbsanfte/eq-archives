<br />
Problem I'm having now is I've just hit 51 and I'm looking for a spot to solo in for decent exp.  It doesn't have to be the 'best' place by any means, I'd prefer a spot with minimal risk, as when I'm soloing I may have to go afk for short stints.  Loot doesn't matter much to me at this point, just hoping to find a decent spot to get a buffer into 51 and pound out a few AAs.<br />
<br />
I'm by no means 'uber' (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=621657), and after five long years finally reaching the 50+ game is a bit overwhelming!<br />
<br />
Well, thanks in advance!<br />
<br />
Stay safe, <br />

I hunted bloodgills in LOIO at 51, but that was pre-Velious.   Best xp is probably gonna be getting a group in PoP, maybe PoI, PoJ or PoD.</div></div><hr />

Then wtf are you posting for! Christ, look up LoY zones. Echo Caverns and shit is old news and boring, not to mention LONG ass respawn times. <br />
<br />
<br />
Here are solo zones there.<br />
<br />
Gunthak - Initiates, level 48-52<br />
Dulak Harbor - whatever, level 45-50<br />
Crypt of Nadox - Shrine Bruisers 52-55<br />
Torgiran Mines - Hallway or Firepit, level 55+<br />
<br />
And don't ever post again! At least for 5 more years and another 5 or so levels :P</div></div><hr />

LGuk or Twilight Sea<br />
<br />
Things you didn't ask for: <br />
Your BP will need to be upgraded soon - pleanty of suggestions around here<br />
Earring of Solstice would be a nice upgrade to DarkFaith<br />
Crystal Spider eyes could upgrade your Face<br />
<br />
this very helpful thread will give you suggestions as you progress, though if you do go to LoY there is a good chance you can find some upgrades there too (http://www.shadowknight.org/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=19752)</div></div><hr />

Kunark dungeon in Frontier mountains, took me from 46 to 51 in about 4 days and most everything is still DB and killer xp.  Suggestion though, grab a KEI and have a mage summon some toys for your pet first.  Tap is your friend there to be sure.  Second note, casters can suck and there are also gobbo SKs down there so the HT can be painful, but it is doable.</div></div><hr />

Rats no longer help everyone and guards don't agro from rats anymore so pulling is easier. Just DoT, Snare and Spear and when they get low fear and kill em. I never used my pet but then again I'm alittle better equiped. Try it should be interesting.<br />
