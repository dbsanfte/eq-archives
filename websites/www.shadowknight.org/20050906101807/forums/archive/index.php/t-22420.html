<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Defftommius</div><div class="date">08-17-2004, 12:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey there, I've been duoing with my bard friend for the past 2 years or so, unfortunately he got a PS2 and well the rest is history. Anyway the last time I soloed I used to fear kite, typically in places in the 40-ish level range like OT,BW,etc. Now that I'm 61 (bout 28% left to 62,) fearing anything is clearly out of the question (that I know of anyway) <br />
<br />
Just wondering what other Soloing tactics us SK's can do that are successful. Also wondering what zones anyone can recommend for said soloing technique. Flies in PoD aren't really doing anything for me anymore. And shouting for Ldon pickup groups is time consuming in itself. Anyway i've got run speed 3 if that changes anything.  Any help is greatly appreciated, thanks for reading. <br />

None of them are particularily good options, but you can at least aggro kite anywhere with a decent amount of open space.  Just in case you don't know, aggro kiting is where you snare a mob and run from it while your pet (with taunt off) runs behind the mob hitting it.  If you find your pet stealing aggro from you (it shouldn't), you can throw other DoTs into the mix like Boil Blood, which is our most efficient DoT besides the pet, to do damage faster and generate a little bit more aggro.<br />
<br />
Some places that you can aggro kite in include Plane of Nightmare, Plane of Disease, Plane of Storms and Plane of Valor.  Once you get access to Halls of Honor you can do it there, too.</div></div><hr />

Not all them where fearable (think dators where not) but where all DB still to me. Loot not bad either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Culdahl</div><div class="date">08-18-2004, 02:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can still fear kite in PoD if you just follow the left wall around by where the spiders spawn (they can't be feared BTW).  Just pull the rats and goos back to said wall and fear it using your shortest duration fear, but be careful as some of the rats will be 55+ and can't be feared either.  The XP is about half of what you'll get in a PoV or better XP group.  Also, if you're completely against group XP then duoing with a shaman (you can tank tier 1 with a slow and light heals easy) or aggro kiting with a good ranja (i know it's an oxymoron) can be decent XP as well, but the best XP post 59 is always group XP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dejet</div><div class="date">08-18-2004, 05:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've spent alot of time soloing in both Pod (ratz and goos) and in Pon (werewolves). At your level the Ratz and goos were decent exp, but don't compare to a PoV or BoT group. My Pod solo fear spots are near the bone wall or along the north wall, west of the Malarians. With Proper placement I used highest level fear, with snare always on fear runs out before they can aggro others (experiment and find where to stand). The PoN spot is along the zone wall, and it can also be done with highest level fear spell, but adds sometimes occur. <br />
     At 65 While /lfg I can get an AA in about 3 hours in Pod, and Pon is a little better, but almost always camped.  Still the best thing would be only use these spots while /lfg, exp will be 2-3 times better with a decent group.<br />

Good Hunting,<br />

<br />
Soloing for levels is really slow going for SKs, you want to reserve it for capping off an unfinished AA point while you are stuck /lfg or just feel like taking it easy and running around in circles for an hour or so...</div></div><hr />
