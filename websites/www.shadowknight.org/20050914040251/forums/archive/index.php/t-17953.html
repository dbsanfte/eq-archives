<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stasus Drutt</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 01:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Right now i am a gnome sk (they are bad ass believe it or not).<br />
<br />
I just created him today and got him to level 6.  So far i am obsessed, he is really fun.  Even more fun now that i got a *something* protector (call me a newb, i forgot the first name), found it on bazaar for 3.3k (a friend bought it for me, for a birthday gift :p, ok back on subject).<br />
<br />
It is a 2 hs weapon, and right now i am owning whites, and i can get yellows to about 10%.<br />
<br />
Now from what i see, all the great sk weapons: Epic (isnt to good, oh well), windblade, ect. are all two hand.  <br />
<br />
Now my question is, should continue with 2hs, or should i spend some more time and accumulate 1 hand?<br />
<br />
Thanks (first post, dont know etiquette of the board yet.)<br />
<br />
P.S. I am not a newb, i used to have a 46 wizard, just he got boring (stand, click, sit, stand, click, sit, stand, click, sit, on and on, hehe.):p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bloodmere</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 07:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">At level 63 i use 2 sets of items, one set for when i am main tank, with a 1hs (longblade of vitality) and a shield (Ashenbone shield), and when i am in a group i use a War Marshall bladed staff to get as much DPS as possible. So i think its a good idea to constantly keep all melee skills as high as possible. Try and get them up to 150 or so. Then you are not completly useless on a weapon if you should find a bargain in Bazaar or a nice drop. There are some 2handers with some decent ac on them, like the Windblade or the Black Bastardsword, but in my opinion a weapon+shield is a better way to get ac/hp up when you take on the role as main tank</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taeluuan</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 07:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the protector if its argent protector should carry you for a while. At low levels grab a Mace of shadowed souls or jaded mace the low delay is most important till the damage cap comes off i believe at 20. Shadow knights are a ton of fun i think they really come into their own around 45 but others may disagree</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solan</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 09:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You were on the wrong track from the second you created him as a gnome though. Re roll him as a different race, then you might actually get on the right track.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stasus Drutt</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 11:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah! thats the name, argent protector.<br />
<br />
So far gnome isnt to bad actually, they have especially high int, so i know that i will have a high mana pool, and i put all beggining pnts in stamina, so he has only a few hps less than an ogre. (started with 32, i believe ogres have 37 or 39 or something.<br />
<br />
Hmm ok, ill try to pick one of those maces up.<br />
<br />
Also, i saw on our AAs, that we get 2hnd bash, will that change so 2nd weapons will be the all time owner in the high end?  Since i will get the same advantage of a shield, plus the uber damage of a 2hnd.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
As a gnome, you can't Slam (= bash with 2 hander equipped) till you get that AA.<br />
<br />
Once you do, you're on a par with large race SKs and can get the greater damage output of 2 handers without losing your bash.<br />
<br />
Till then I'd be inclined to use a good one hander and shield by default, while keeping 2Hs up if you can.<br />
<br />
Bash is handy for interrupting caster mobs, and spamming it on non-casters adds significant extra hate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Putrid</div><div class="date">10-31-2003, 08:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am glad you are having fun.  Any race is fine.  SK's can be tough to play in stretches, dont get discouraged.  Wait till you hit 30 and 49.  Those are exciting times to be an SK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ramgar SK</div><div class="date">10-31-2003, 04:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honestly you'd get better damage output from a moss, than a 2h at low levels.  Until 20th the damage cap criples big weapons.  Even at 20th the damage reduction is significant.<br />
<br />
Look into a reaver as a good twink weapon (no level requirement).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stasus Drutt</div><div class="date">10-31-2003, 10:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually i do have a good 2hs, Argent Protector.  42/49, 10 ac, 10 str, 10 sta, 10 int, 25hp, or something like that, All i would need is a good haste item.<br />
<br />
I also have a moss, found one on bazaar for 15pp :D <br />
<br />
Thanks for your input guys.</div></div><hr />
