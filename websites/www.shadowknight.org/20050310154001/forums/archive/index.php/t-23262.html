<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fedarov</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just a FYI on something that happeneed to me while soloing the PoG drop.<br />
<br />
You can pretty much kill a horse in the time it takes the PoGs to aggro you, Which is what i was doing successfully for the first 6 steeds,<br />
<br />
But i got impatient and loged my lil cleric on and took her to PoG sat her in corner and used snare to keep mobs still while i FD for heals (i didnt want to trash tunare faction on cleric) when the PoGs aggroed i decided to take em, so i blew h touch on first one and then meleed him down then snared 2nd one and FD.<br />
<br />
My ds + reposte had taken the second one to about 75% before i had snared him and Feigned, I did not notice he had warped while i was FD (they dont camp corpse long at all and often warp if snared) as soon as i stood up &quot;You have been summoned&quot; I was at the tunare tree, taking a beating, If it hadent been for CoS and FD it would have been dead fed.<br />
<br />
In Short my advice to anyone soloing the PoG drop is either kill the PoGs or ignore em but dont do anything inbetween as it will result in a royal summons to the tunare tree :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>raker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">This is interesting...I have a druid that i box with so I noticed a couple things in here perhaps you can clarify for me.<br />
<br />
1st...(sounds noob) if you get healed when FD the healer will be ok on aggro and possible faction hits? ( I haven;t been boxin for long)<br />
<br />
2nd,  If after killing one PoG then FD'ing after then 2nd = 75%... can u wait for &quot;your emeninies have forgotten you&quot; then stand back up to avoid the summon and then just wait for the PoG to come running back over?  Or will he perma remember you hit him and just summon?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>grinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">the PoGs have a zone wide agro range, so unless u have been invised while FD, when u get up the PoG will agro on you and summon if it has gone below 96% hp.<br />
<br />
when you kill the first one and FD target the 2nd one, and dont stand util its regened if it has warped away.<br />
thats if you cant kill both without a heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Elhrairah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Heres the lowdown on PoGs/faction/fd; although this is all info posted in other threads.<br />
<br />
When u zone in, the PoGs start runnin. You have less than 3 minutes from zone in till first PoG gets to u.They come in pairs. You kill your horse, then FD.<br />
<br />
If a healer heals you while you are FD, but before you get your &quot;enemies has forgotten you&quot; message, that healer has just aggrod the PoGs. They will, repeat will, be on thier way towards your healer to eat them. If for some reason u still want to have your healer do this, than use a druid who can egress themselves. Egress will allow them to heal you and prevent faction/aggro from becoming an issue if they eggress b4 mob dies. PoGs regen very quickly when they arent aggrod, so no, you will never be summoned after hurting a PoG if u wait the full 2 minutes and get the message. It should be at 100% by then, hence wont summon.<br />
<br />
Personally, I dont see why you would want to kill the PoGs. There are never that many horses up, and it only takes 45 mins to clear em all anyway; PoGs are a waste of mana and just a way to get yourself killed in this zone. Treat them as a distraction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>nytemyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">if you can dual box a cleric or shammy just kill those pogs doesnt take that long and it'll save you time in the long run.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nasiir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I did this with a cleric and just killed the PoGs at the L1 safe spot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Talkatan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Getting healed while FD'd and before the 'forgotten you' message does not cause the healer to get agro, least it didn't for my cleric who successfully healed me several times with the PoG's stood over me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Darkmourn D`Estrellas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yeah, healing a FD target transfers no aggro, no matter how long the person has been down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Oskuro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">. PoGs regen very quickly when they arent aggrod, so no, you will never be summoned after hurting a PoG if u wait the full 2 minutes and get the message. It should be at 100% by then, hence wont summon.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have been summoned after got the message 2 mintues after fd, so they dont regen so fast.<br />
<br />

Salud.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Belyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I didnt bother to try this because of gear, but fear may work on these.  Some PoG's were light blue.  If so just snare em both and keep one feared while ya kill the other.  I would use the short duration fear for this, and if it starts summoning just keep running for the wall till it gets close...though the one your fighting will most likely keep summoning you back...and re fear it.<br />
<br />
However you do it, make sure you take your time killing the second one so there is a nice gap inbetween their next spawning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Drahkanis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">One more thing is... don't bother using a pet in PoG. The pets get aggro from PoGs (which I didn't know) so even if you're FD, the PoGs will still come and kill your pet.<br />
<br />
Drahkanis</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Elhrairah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hmm well if other people are having different experiences with FD and healing, I dont know what to say. I did PoG with me and a druid, and if the druid ever landed a heal while I was FD but not &quot;forgotten&quot; they would aggro her;she wouldnt get a faction hit I dont believe, but she surely did draw the PoG aggro. I got my hair a week ago, and I doubt such a thing has been changed since then, but others obviously have had different experiences. Since I already have my hair, Im not gonna go experiment to see how things have changed.<br />
<br />
As for the PoGs and summoning, I guess If u beat one down to 5% or something and then waited your 2 minutes it might not regen enough, but you would only do something like that to prove me wrong. The original question was someone worried about DS and riposte damage bein an issue. Anyway, if my intel is wrong, I apologize, but its all gathered first hand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Iosif_McCloud</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I Box my druid 90% of time im playing even if thay are not in my group thay are doing things for me...<br />
<br />
I have not had any agro from healing wile FD.. in every zone from Kith to MPG and every expanchen inbtween...  So if your gettin Agro wile FD there is another issues there...<br />
<br />
As for the PoG... I only had to do them once took no time to mow them down.. i got my pice from first kill...  Thay arnt really any harder then the steeds IMO.. But if you cant efftively kill them i would kill 1 since thay only respawns as Sets of 1-3 .. So you can kill them down to 1 then FD let him reset and you will only have one in zone chaseing your down.. if you have a Druid smack it with Snare then Egress it will be out of your hair for a good long time (10Mins or so) as long as you FD for a min or 2 after every kill to make it warp back to the tree</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jouen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Two boxed this with my sk and a necro w/pet(necro pet fd negates the pog aggro). Would always pull to the area behind zone in. Fd'd both toons. Spot a steed alone, tagged and killed before pogs came. And if for some reason i wasn't paying attention i would drop a fresh snare on the horse while pogs ran back. Jump up and finished it off. <br />
<br />
Monk friend came next time and said just kill the bitches. Other then a few nukes, necro/monk/sk killed both pogs fast and no one was in any real danger. Made camping the hair a lot easier.</div></div><hr />
