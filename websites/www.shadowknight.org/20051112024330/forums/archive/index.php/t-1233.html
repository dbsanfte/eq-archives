I've been doing a little research into the advantages I might get by allying with giants and it seems that very few people take that route.  <br />
<br />
I already have a &quot;good&quot; toon that kills lots of giants and I don't want to take the same path with my SK - I mean I'm evil c'mon :mad: .  Anyway can someone who has aligned themselves to the giants over the coldain enlighten me as to the advantages this brings?  Will killing Coldain cause me more headache in the long run than is necessary?<br />

Also there is the series of ring and shawl quests, and the town has lots of supplies for trade skills.  That being said there are some nice things about siding with giants.  There are some nice quests to be done in Kael.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarkWyld</div><div class="date">04-30-2002, 11:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Seriously, there are some nice things to be said for all 3 of the factions, so it primarily depends on what you want out of the game.  If you want to go for the High AC armor with minor stats and the Collar of the Storm, then Giant Faction is the way to go.  If you want decent armor with stats or you plan to quest for the Coldain Rings/Shawls, then work on Coldain Faction.  If you want moderately high AC armor with stats and resists, then you will need Dragon Faction - which means you have to kill giants, especially Storm Giants.  And if you are killing giants for the Skyshrine (Dragon) armor, then you will probably want to maintain your Dwarf Faction.  But all of this assumes you plan to work on the uber high-end game.<br />
<br />
If you are a casual player and plan to hunt alot in Velious, I would recommend you stay on Coldain Faction for the access to the Thurgadin Merchants.  I personally would not trash my Coldain faction just because it seems like the way to go for the sake of Roleplay - after all, for RP, the Giants already HATE you.  Just my opinion!!  Do the research and determine your goals, then curry the favor of the faction you need to achieve it.</div></div><hr />
