<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Pavil Gravebringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">No one needs us to FD pull anymore?! Pallys - Clerics - Enchanters got pacify so why do they need us to pull.  I find myself using FD to drop aggro to the main tank now instead of using it as a pull tactic.  Does anyone else feel that we should get a pacify type ability or spell? Or is it just me? Monks are getting it as a type of learned disipilne.  Maybe I missed something but I think it sucks. Pulling was part of the fun of being a SK.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hatre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Much agreement Kizzestra, 45 is too low for calm undead to stop affecting mobs.  I was very dissapointed when after 3-4 levels of being puller/tank in MM dungeons I passed that limit and had to relinquish my pulling role to the clerics chanters bards and pallis.<br />
I vote for the level cap on our Calm undead to be raised to 55.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Makkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd be happy if they just gave us an improved undead pacify. I don't need one that works against everything. Neither do necros it's BS<br />
<br />
It's pretty lame how FD pulling has been obsoleted. It's not that you can't do it in LDoN and XP groups - it just takes too much time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Drakonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well, they stated that they never intended FD to be a pulling device... I can understand that...<br />
<br />
What I can't understand is why they left it as the MAIN pulling instrument for 5 (i think) expansions, then suddenly changed it before the next one!  No one would have thought twice about it if they're &quot;fixed&quot; it with Kunark or Velious for example.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>synnoira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Undead lull upgrade for us and necro's would make sense, but it wouldn't be something i'd be too fussed about personally. <br />
<br />
Paladins ability to lull mobs is capped on mobs at 55. So beyond a certain point in game they cease to be lull-pullers (it is great for them at lower levels mind you).<br />
<br />
Clerics have the most boring gameplay in the whole of EQ. Giving them a reason to doing somethingelse seems quite benign to me.<br />
<br />
If you have a competent chanter single pulling is generally far too slow. Better to pull 4 or so at a time. Most enchanters i know like that kind of crowd control approach anyway. <br />
<br />
It's really bard lull combined with FM which is a big deal for pulling.</div></div><hr />

Well not intended for pulling when the game started, they made adjustment to FD when they saw how it was being used. Also they knew Death Peace would be used for pulling when they gave it to us.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Moghedred</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">best puller in LDoN groups so far was a cleric for me. he chain pulled mobs - single. I am kind of happy they can do that, though most refuse to (slackers).<br />
<br />
anyhow, try have a bard single pull say the Earth Tower boss and his cronies... bye, bye bard. not that you need to single pull them, but still, you can.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Our bard can single pull Hailstorm to the tower entrance,  we only have to kill 2 mobs.<br />
<br />
upgrade in undead lull would be cool</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Fedarov</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I would just be happy if they actualy gave the knights a role in the game that wasent directly linked to how well warriors can tank, and how well monks can pull.<br />
<br />
Every clas in EQ &quot;should&quot; have a &quot;defined&quot; role to play in, a group, a reason for the group to say yeh get that Sk/Pally cause they can ............(fill in the blanks here). <br />
<br />
With the new melle changes I am afraid Sk and palladin will be returned to beeing thought of as the 2nd rate tanks we were a year ago. I have nothing against warriors getting reinstated as number 1 tank but if that is the way VI want to play it then they have to give the knights something to do. Bigger debuffs, Higher DPS or .......i duno anything.<br />
<br />
I have played my sk since june 2001 (on and off) and i am yet to see a role in a group that i wasent in at the expense of a warrior or a monk.  Give Sk there THANG !! please</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>MasterVicker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Once again.<br />
<br />
I dont know where you guys are getting this from.  This is nothing like the kunark era.  <br />
<br />
We are simply ~a different kind of tank~.  Thats why i chose an sk anyway.  I wanted an al pacino tank.  Not a lou ferigno(spelling) tank.<br />
<br />
I dont know about you end of the world seers but I am getting what I wanted.<br />
<br />
The FIRST part of the patch was nothing overpowering and nothing mind blowing to everyone.  So sit back and enjoy the new perks we got.<br />
<br />
...undead lull to 55 would be cool...</div></div><hr />

So who else is Jacked Off about Pulling?<br />

*Ahem* excuse me been apretty boring day at work today.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Where are you going to hunt at higher levels where this will even be needed? LDoN? Deep inside CoD? CharB?<br />
<br />
We can already pull fine here with the skills we have. I'd rather get a new spell I could use in ANY situation then just CERTAIN situations.</div></div><hr />

1) Don't forget Hate's Fury<br />
2) Genrally this board is about wanting,  not needing, (which is no fun) or having (which wouldn't be what we thought we wanted anyway)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sabazios</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">at the end game of eq, no sks didn't get jacked at pulling due to the level limit pacify works on.  <br />
<br />
however, if you are referring to groups then i guess you can look at it that way...i guess.<br />
<br />
But then since i'm generally lazy in exp groups i enjoy when rangers, clerics, or enchanters use their powers to single.  It helps me to afk better.  So really you should be happy like me!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">With recent changes to Pacify/Lull lines, it's not that big a deal anymore anyway.  42 second duration makes for some difficult single pulls, but as someone said here earlier, pulling single is much slower than pulling three or four mobs and mezzing them in camp anyway, and if you ask your friendly neighborhood chanter, they'll tell you it takes less of their mana to do so as well.<br />
<br />
All in all, I've been in LDoN groups who used Paci pull, I've FD pulled there, and we've just pulled trains and mezzed, and by far the fastest and best solution in that situation is the third.  But situations differ, and I can still FD pull fine when it's called for.</div></div><hr />

?! Pallys -got pacify [/URL]  <br />
<br />
Which pacifies only up to 55. its crap and totally useless at 60+<br />
<br />
I rarely use FD pulling tactics, mainly because in my typical LDoN group it doesnt matter if we get 1 or 5 mobs.<br />

Have you ever been there? That zone is a total waste of resources. Mobs that are not shy in hitpoints of PoV golems, yet only give half their experience. Nameds that drop so utter trash, the time it takes to move to HF and to them can be used to skill up a tradeskiller and from 0 and create something yourself. <br />
Oh, and undead ratio is at most 25% there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Nugaruk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I vote for the upgrade to undead lull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Vdaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I dont know about you, but warriors still cannot hold agro as well as I can, As soon as my shammy hits slow and a warrior is MT I gain agro, I usually have to wait until mob is like 75% to slow, which is making the cleric use mana needlessly, Now with Pally or SK as MT I slow instantly, Cripple, Malo, DoT and dont get agro. <br />
<br />
As for my SK, I hardly ever loose agro, hardly meaning less than 1% of the time, regardless of the situation. <br />
<br />
Warriors may have more AC, HP, DPS than us SK's, but we are number 1 with Keeping agro IMO. So with my Shammy I will continue to insist on an SK and secondly a Pally as MT, just use the warrior for DPS. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Blackeagle Dwimmerlaik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">you're also level 58.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Sabazios</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">so what if he is 58? is he incorrect that you can't hold agro well? unless you are commenting on using wars for dps!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Dkhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I vote for undead lull up to level 65. Let's face it, if you try to lull a 65 undead you're probably going to get resisted and have it after you anyway. It would be more of a luck factor than anything. But under 60 it would be very useful in certain circumstances. I think the level should be this high because of the fact that it is only targeted at a small percentage of mobs in the game. It will not be used to lull normal mobs like half of every other class in EQ can do. At least let us be the masters of undead.<br />
<br />
I love the undead nukes we've gotten in LDoN. I was going to complain about how pathetic our normal ones were but now I can't. Damn you Sony.<br />
<br />
I think an undead charm would rock as well. Paladins slay undead, we charm them :D Damn that's a good idea. Joboner... meet Jonober.</div></div><hr />
