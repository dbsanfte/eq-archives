<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shainaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just considering that the weapon has bane damage to it, seems sorta worth while to camp this charm:  Chipped Lion Fang (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=19992) <br />
<br />
I had posted about slightly in the &quot;Arena Section&quot; but considering the function of it... it also seemed worthwhile to note here as well.<br />
<br />
It drops off dastardly scoundral fort area.  scoundral is a gnome seems he can pop anywhere around the fort in Gulf of Gunthark.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zenobie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I camped this guy several hours, PL guilides. Never seen this bastard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Orthogonon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I was killing stuff around fort for a while to get troll heads.  Saw this guy once...popped as a gnome, not sure if he is always a gnome.   Didn't drop the charm.  Never saw him again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Skaarx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">He dropped a dull metallic cloak for me while camping the Troll HEads, only seen him once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zzketza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">This little spud pops in one location, at the back of a hut directly south of the &quot;main gate&quot; of the fort in the first pirate cave.  Location is neg2300, neg300 roguhly.  Just keep on killing that mob and he will pop.  I've killed him 4 times so far, and every time he has dropped the cloak (which made a couple friends really happy for their lowbie chanters).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ghismonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Okay, does anyone actually HAVE this piece of shit charm?  This camp is becoming a real nightmare.<br />
<br />
I've camped him for five days so far, every time spending at least one KEI there.  (Sometimes it's 2.5 hrs, othertimes it's 4hrs).  I kill the placeholder and all the mobs surrounding it that hut, the fort entrance, and all the warriors in the fort.  The long ass twenty minute spawn doesn't help, but...<br />
<br />
In all this time, I've only see the asshole once.  And obviously, he dropped the cloak, not the charm.  Does anyone actually HAVE this charm and can confirm that he does, in fact, drop it?<br />
<br />
I got no problem with camps.  I got my Greenmist, I got my Eyepatch of Plunder.  But can anyone, in fact, confirm that this is the mob that drops the charm?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zenobie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Camped it... too much time. IMHO, it is worst than camping Dalnir or CoM for Greenmist. Saw the guy once, got the cloak. I'll be back.</div></div><hr />
