<br />
1) He's gonna get gay married<br />
2) I wonder if he'll like any of their politicians<br />
3) I didn't know grim played hockey...ass-hockey and is moving to Canada to get gay-married</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>brian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">lol <br />

I think you can get gay married in Assachusetts now too.  but they have no Ass-hockey?  I dunno...</div></div><hr />

Hey, fuck you! We have at least 4 of them....<br />
<br />
Anyway, no, Grim won't like any of our politicians, because they're all just as stupid as yours are.</div></div><hr />

For (almost) legal weed and that hottie, i'd learn to love hockey. <br />
<br />
But I doubt it's that bad because when you really look, it becomes very clear that the US is far to the right of every other major, industrialized nation. We have the least progressive tax structure. We offer the least support to underclasses. We have the harshest system of handling certain disruptions in the status quo (crime). And we have politics more geared toward maintaining class structures than any other (and, in fact, less class mobility). Clinton's welfare &quot;reform&quot; would have been considered loony-right anywhere else. Hell, that Clinton is even considered &quot;left&quot; is quite telling.</div></div><hr />

I pretty much sucks having to scrape shit off my car windows in the morning 3 months a year here, I can't imagine wanting to extend that</div></div><hr />

Well, rarely.<br />
<br />
Only slight drawback is......<br />
<br />
...no summer either:P<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Come to Saskatchewan (or &quot;Asskatchewan&quot;, if you're Keevel), and you'll learn what winter really is. May is supposed to be spring/summer, right? Meaning no snow? WRONG. We had snow just last week. I saw snow fly in July up north (not even that far north, probably only about 10 hours from the U.S. border), for an entire weekend. Scraping your car for 3 months? Shit, we're lucky if we get 3 months off.<br />

Besides, it sucks losing younger siblings that don't know how to swim when your igloo melts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>dzenith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">In less than a month Canada's government very well may be further right than America's.  There are 3 main parties running for this election: one left, one right, and one central.  The central party is the current government, which has been ridden with scandal lately related to the giving away of billions of dollars to fake companies.  That and the fact that they haven't appeared to do much of anything nor keep much of their previous election promises (just like every government, but we only remember the present one) have made them lose much popularity.  The left party doesn't have a chance of gaining a majority just as they never have, because they are seen as not being able to handle economic policies reliably, and there just aren't enough leftists in the country.  Since the central party is more likely to get a majority than the left party, many people who are leftists will vote for the central party just to keep the right party from getting in.  So it comes down to voting for a far right party or voting for the same fucked up government that we've had for the past 3 terms(or if you are a leftist, deciding whether it is better to try to get your favoured party in or preventing the far right party from getting in).   <br />
<br />
The right party wants us to put a vast sum of money into our military, will probably revoke gay marriages(even though they say they will hold a free vote I doubt they would keep to this if they get into power), and it is very doubtful the decriminalisation of pot would go through with them either.  So in summation: moving to Canada may very well just be like moving to a colder USA.  Except there still will be that one hot blonde.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Lejina Bloodbath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">In less than a month Canada's government will be much likely led by a minority party.<br />
<br />
Best thing that could happen at this point if you ask me, regardless if the Liberal or the Conservative party wins.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>dzenith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">If the conservatives get a minority, they would have to get support from bq in order to pass bills, which would only happen at great costs.  If the liberal government gets a minority, then they would have to make a pact with ndp, which would be a lot less painful.  Either that or an election will be called again right away, then who knows who will win.  I personally am not sure who I am going to vote for.  When I look at the new conservative party I see a bunch of previous alliance trying to look more mainstream to win the election and then go fascist after they win.  The NDP looks like a good platform if they could show some proof of fiscal responsibility.  And the liberals...   Bunch of bad choices if you ask me.  I think a liberal minority would be the best possibility.</div></div><hr />
