<br />
Didn't take any damage and didn't use HT.  I am trying to work on resist gear and have a little bag that gets me to 116 in MR and near that in FR.  Not much but on a blue server that seems to be ok so far.  <br />
<br />
Not one snare or root landed except on my pet and I resisted 2 nukes before I finally speared him down and bashed him to interupt his heals.  Then a quick cast of the lvl 49 life leech and he was gone.<br />
<br />
I guess he didn't put up damage shield because he said and I quote..&quot; You know that I am just going to root and dot you.  So expect to lose exp.&quot;  I replied to him.  &quot;I'm no Hill Giant.&quot;<br />
<br />
Afterwords I was told that I was cheating because I had outside buffs to raise my resists.  If I was mean I should have stopped and dropped a dot on him and made him lose exp.  <br />
<br />
So far its 2 pallies and 1 druid down.  The most annoying classes there are.  Though I think the one pally I beat is looking to do me in.  Everytime he goes by me he inspects me looking to see what I have on.  I guess he will never get over the embarrasment of losing to me and only living because I stopped beating on his sorry ass.  He /q out of group.  He also said I was a cheater because I didn't stand in front of him and just melee while he cast stuns and roots on me.  Nine levels to go before the super ht.  Should be to 65 within a year woot.</div></div><hr />
