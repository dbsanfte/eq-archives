<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ainya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yes it's MQable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Someone should probably sticky a description of the faction involved.  You never change from apprehensive.  But each step gives a faction boost, within the apprehensive range, that is *required* to do the next step.  If you choose to do it out of order or MQ with someone who has not also done the same steps, expect to lose your MQ pieces.  Theres two ways around it.  First, invis during the hand in.  Put the pieces in the trade window, get invis, hit trade.  It will put you up to indif.  Second is running seals, but that doesnt do anything about the MQ person unless they want to do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kindredwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Here is my delema, I have the spine, and enchanted Platinum bar, a friend got me the hide by luck before the hate revamp. She is a High Elf Cleric, and isn't even apprehensive, infact they hate her very much near Teydar. We are trying to figure out how to MQ it. She is willing to faction hunt and quest to help. But I am afraid that will kill some of her good faction....Any ideas as to what we should do?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dester</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">its simple as long as your friend isn't KoS to True spirit faction.<br />
<br />
simply pull Teydar out of the sk/ necro guild. (zone is close or you can /q out)<br />
<br />
at zone or where you FD, simply have the cleric or who ever you got to invis her hail Teydar untill you are ready to do the turn in (ie clear agro from your pull)  BTW the necros/ sks won't assist Teydar so no worries there.<br />
<br />
when ready have your friend give the hide, get invis and hit trade.  You then give the bar and spine and you get the sheath.<br />
<br />
Did this about 2 weeks ago, Though it was a ranger so she just used hide instead of invis<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zurdaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Is Plane of Hate soloable by a 65 sk? i know i know it's probly a stupid question, but it's worth knowing :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dester</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Depends on your gear and AA<br />
<br />
If you had a ton of FT and massive hps/ AC/ Resists you would be ok.<br />
<br />
bout 3 in 5 mobs there are casters covering all types.<br />
<br />
A couple unresisted ice comets from the litchs up there would take a nice chunk out of your self buffed hps quite fast.<br />
<br />
The cleric mobs would be a total pain as they heal for ever, and the pure melee mobs hit quite fast for up to 280s.<br />
<br />
while i CAN duo with a cleric up there at 62, its way to in-efficent to even try.<br />
<br />
I honestly dont' think it would be worth your time or effort if you can't find a healing partner to go with.  Unless you have very good gear/ resists that is.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Saruton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">65 Sk with a 56 Wiz Bot and i have absolutely no problems at all. Only Clerics with their §$/§%( CHeal are quite annoying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jinsei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Zurdaan! Hey! Yes, as far as I know it is possible to solo there, though I do think I saw little increase in the DPS of the mobs since the revamp...Oh well, if your bored just get a shaman to come with ya. They always help :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sabrosia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Had a ranger friend MQ mine - but he had to use sneak ...  He also had an insta clicky invis (not sure if it was potions or what)<br />
<br />
Not sure if he could have done it without sneak tho...</div></div><hr />
