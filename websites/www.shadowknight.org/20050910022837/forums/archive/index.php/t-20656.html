<br />
Shadow Knight’s are the second most powerful Tanks in the Game, and the DPS masters of the Plate classes. They employ a wide array of tactics to slaughter the masses. They are the hybrid of a warrior / necromancer, and as such are at the forefront of the battle. A wise Shadow Knight will be aware of his surroundings at all times. He is often chose to be either puller or tank, and is aware if the feces hits the fan he may need to resort to desperate measures. A well-placed spear of Disease, D.O.T, or Harm Touch may be just what the party needs. However, if party members start dying you may need to Feign Death quick. Always be able to accurately assess the situation. <br />
<br />
First, we will start with character creation. When I first created Shadowrage I had several races to choose. At the high end of the game race does not matter, but in the lower levels (1- 50), it most certainly will. Gnomes level the fastest; although in my honest opinion as well as many others are the laughing stocks of the Shadow Knight community. Let us be honest, how fearsome can these cute little creatures be (LOL)? Dark Elf’s are second for leveling speed, and have the second highest INT score behind Erudite’s. They also start with the ability to hide to start out with, which comes in very handy. Humans are next, although they are blind as a bat, this is easily overcome and should matter none. I laugh at the people who think this matters. There are all too many really good items out there for humans to see just as well as the other races. Not to mention the spells we get at the higher levels that negate this disability. Humans also have decent starting statistics. Erudites are next, although they should stick with spell casting and leave the Shadow Knight business to us. This is just my opinion, if however my words do not sway you, feel proud that you have the highest starting INT of all the races. Ogres take an EXP hit although they start with ungodly strength and can not be stunned from the front. They are dumb as a rock though, and lets face it if you wanted to be a hack then you should have chosen a warrior. Ogres, in my honest opinion, never get the ability to cast as well as the other races, and until the higher levels face this problem continuously. Trolls and Iksar level the absolute slowest. Beware, if you choose either one be prepared to spend twice the time leveling as your other Shadow Knight counterparts. They do get regen though (useful when Feign Death’d, lying on the ground, you will actually be able to recover HP’s). Also at the higher levels, through AA’s, you can also add more regeneration power. You will no doubt be thankfull for this. Also one more note, Iksar have the ability to obtain the alternate EPIC “Greenmist, the Unholy Kukri of Rile” far easier than the other races, and can skip the long painstaking faction work involved to enter the city of Cabalis. With that being said Race truly only matters in your starting life, I recommend choosing the race you think looks cool and has a history you enjoy. <br />
<br />
Choosing where to place your starting statistics should be easy. Put all of them into Stamina. This is the hardest stat to raise, and because you are going to need every ounce of HP’s that you can muster, I recommend putting them all into this. All of the other stats are easy to raise either through equipment or buffs.  You will be spending your life in the forefront of the battle though, and Stamina will have a great impact on you survival. You have been warned.<br />
	<br />
Harm Touch(HT). Throughout my life as a Shadow Knight I have found limited resources containing how I should employ this spectacular ability and when. I have therefore several tips that may help anyone who is at that place where I once was. Harm Touch is an ability granted to the Shadow Knight from our Dark God. If I am soloing I keep Harm Touch reserved and ready. If, the enemy is all too hard (and is spankin my bottom like I was a redheaded stepchild) I will HT. Then often more than not they think twice before messing with me. Now in a group it becomes tricky. I will use HT every chance I can, if I get in one of those great groups where we are killing yellow and red mobs one after the other. I simply cast it just to help that much more. If however, I am grouped in an area that is dangerous for my level, or I am unsure of the abilities of the people I am playing with, I save it. I cannot count the times people have complimented how handy that skill must be to have, simply because I needed it to save the group from getting into trouble. More often than not though I look at it like this, If I have to rely on HT to save my behind that bad, then I must assess the situation to make sure that it don’t get too out of hand for the group. All in all, it is a great ability to have, but if you do not use it you might as well not have it. Let others see what you came to be a Shadow Knight for, and what you are.<br />
	<br />
PETS. Always cast a pet (unless, you are in a dungeon where if your pet wanders too far he may just bring back the entire dungeon) your pet is always useful to you. The Shadow Knight pet is only meant to provide that little bit of extra damage. Give him a weapon and a shield though, and his damage output increases extremely. I always carry several weapons and shields on me to give to my pet. Initially, I cast my pet, give him a weapon, and tell it to no taunt. Second, make sure that you instruct it to guard whatever place you have designated as camp. This is because our pet dies easily, even though he may put out decent damage. Therefore, if you have your pet guarding a particular spot, you have more of a choice as to what he attacks and when. Your pet will hit for maximum damage more often than not if you place him behind the enemy you are fighting also. This also, is accomplished very easily if you have already had your pet guarding. For the added damage he gives, you simply cannot afford not to cast him. Not to mention he will gladly sacrifice his life for yours in a pinch, while you make your strategic escape. =) <br />
	<br />
LVL’S 1-9. First, you must see the Shadow Knight guild master. This is easy since upon creation you start several feet from him. Secondly, we must earn our armor. Unless you already had good armor given to you by a friend, you will need to start questing for your armor. Every young Shadow Knight should make this quest his or her first goal, this is because despite what others may tell you it really is not difficult. NOTE: The calcified bones needed are rather rare. While you hunt, make sure you frequently let other players in the zone know you are looking for them. This will make finding them that much easier. I found that the skeleton camp by the East Commonlands zone had dropped them more often than any other place. If you get into trouble you can run back to the bridge (where several guards are just for your safety) or just zone out. If that was not convenient enough, there is a merchant by the bridge also. You could very easily stay here until all the bones are gathered. Another good place is by the Lavastorm zone line. To the left as you are about to enter the zone there is an area where you may find skele’s that drop calcified bones also. Watch out for this area though, as you will quickly be overrun by mobs. Make sure you hunt here in a group, before you take on this place solo. At level nine, you will have enough cash to buy your spells, and if you saved bone chips as I did, you will have enough bone chips to last you for 10-20 levels. <br />
	<br />
LVL’S 10-15.  By now you probably have either all or most of you armor, and are ready for more. Head to the Planes of Knowledge (This can be done through the book in Nectulos Forest), and once there you will need only two buffs. I say this because with these two buffs alone you can level very fast. The first buff is Temperance(given by clerics), and often can be given free if you explain that you are a newbie. It does however sell for around 9 platinum usually due to the peridot that is consumed upon spellcasting. For the second buff, Regeneration, you will have to find a druid. Simply shout this, and more often than not, you will find one quickly. Regeneration wares off quicker than Temperance (which lasts for about 2 hours), so you may have to come back more than once. Now that you are buffed, head to the Field of Bone by using the Cabalis Stone. Once you are there start making your way to Kurn’s Tower. This zone yields awesome experience simply because of the added experience bonus. You can easily stay here until level 15 or 16. After that experience will start to slow down. Here you will have access to undead, an area in which we shine, as well as easy and quick access to the PoK.  <br />
	<br />
LVL’S 16-25. Now that you have skyrocketed in levels you will need a good place to go next. Start making your way to the Nexus, by using the Nexus stone in the PoK, then head to the Shadow Haven zone. Once you are in Shadow Haven use your map to find the Paludal Caverns Zone. This will be your new home. You will find this is the best experience and loot in the game for this level. Everyone knows it too. The average drop here will easily sell for one to three Plat. on the average. Make sure you don’t try this zone solo though, your best bet is find a group and watch the levels fly by. There is however a mushroom in the passage as you first enter which is easily solo’d. Also beware as you look for a group here to watch for trains that players will pull by occasionally. <br />
	<br />
LVL’S 26-35. Now you may be ready to start your Darkforge Armor quests. Darkforge armor is definitely worth earning. Head to Cazic-Thule and start the quest. I will not go into detail about doing the armor here. If you find that you need information head to one of the numerous sites on the internet. After you have your armor and you need somewhere to hunt head to Overthere through the stone in PoK. Here you will have no trouble finding a group. Another good place is Marus Seru. First, go to the Nexus Zone and head to Netherbian Lair. Once in Netherbian Lair, head straight down the passage and make the first right at the Giant Pillar. You will run right into the zone. You will get decent experience, though you will not get rich to say the very least.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Darkforge Armor drops are found in Feerrott, outside the Lost Temple of Cazic Thule, not inside it.  There are several walk throughs for this quest on this board with the correct information.<br />
<br />
Positioning your mob so that your pet is attacking from behind, while beneficial, doesn't guarantee maximum hits.  The hits will be bigger from behind, and average hit values may go up, but maximum hits aren't determined simply by mob positioning.<br />
<br />
Calcified bones are not needed for every racial newbie armor set.  The required components will vary based on race and starting city.<br />
<br />
All things considered, Darkforge is very difficult to quest at any level below 30, unless you are twinked.  Personally, I spent 7 levels questing this armor, and finished at level 36.  Additionally, The Overthere is more deserted now than it used to be, and groups are not always easy to be found.<br />
<br />
In general, your information is gap-filled at best, utterly worthless and poorly written at worst.  Perhaps you should spend some of the immeasurable time you have on your hands not only reading this board and learning the class, but also working on your writing skills.</div></div><hr />

I don't think you need to tell people how to get to Paludal. Just follow the trail of drool left there by the lobotomised mutants who went before.<br />
<br />
<br />
What happens at level 36 and beyond? Is that where the young Paludal Graduates discover that using the possesive instead of the plural for every noun they see is guaranteed to cause some of us to want to rip their fingernails out?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stattic</div><div class="date">03-17-2004, 07:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess I would agree with some of it but as far as the pet , IT BLOWS!! Yes its extrsa dps but come on if your in a group then do what you want but I have found it just gets in my way unless im SOLOING/KITING and i NEED some DPS. <br />
<br />
Not to go to deep into tactics but here are a few pointers that I know WORK!!<br />
<br />
AC AC AC and HP hP HP is a must. Stats will not make that much  of a diffrence until later in the game. Dont go for the BIG STR and stuff and forget about your protection. <br />
Look, its just like jumping off a wall wrapped ina sheet. YOU WILL GET HURT!!<br />
<br />
Now jump off the same wall wrapped in a matris. The worst that will happen is you will have a headache. See what I am getting at?<br />
<br />
All through your SK life PERMA MEM your lvl 15 darkness spell and use this spell to gain agro with any lvl mob. TRUST ME IT WORKS!<br />
It casts faster then the upgrades and uses less mana when you need to regain teh agro in a fight. Now im not saying to NOT use your upgrades but always have this loaded.<br />
<br />
Also this may be obviouse but stack your SPEAR nukes. Im 56 now and can NUKE for 790 DD with my 3 spells. This saves time on the spell reload time.<br />
<br />
When you get your ENDURE COLD spell CAst the piss out of this spell because your FD spell rides on the same SPell Skill!<br />
<br />
<br />
OK LVLING!<br />
Now where to go at lvl 1, Thats easy! FIELD OF BONE is best for your class. Kill in the newbie areas like in and a round the dead lake. At lvl 9-10 go into the tower and reep the benefits of the 150 xp adjustment. In there you will have nothing but fun and loot STACKS upon STACKS of bones for that SISSY pet of ours.<br />
Now around 15-16 jam over to PC and reep that 160 xp adjustment (The highest xp zone in the game).<br />
<br />
Look, after you get to understand what a SK can and cant do you will really start to love this class. SK are so addicting becasue of the power!!<br />
<br />
A good SK knows how to Gain agro and keep his/her group alive, even if it costs you your life in doing so. There is no better feeling then when you are thowing down with a mob and you look at your group window and see that they are all full HP.=)<br />
<br />
Now a  great SK knows how NOT to gain agro in a fight if they are grouping with a better tank. Look if there is a WARR with the same gear or better LET HIM TANK!!!!!! dont be a bad ass and show every one that you can gain and hold agro over anyone. WE all know we can and so does every one else. Just ask your pissed off cleric when he has to heal 2 tanks in a battle.<br />
Its so easy to gain agro being a SK. Learn your spells and know how to use them WELL!!<br />
<br />
I can go on and on about having control over your power and not letting the power of your character get you and your group killed!!!<br />

<br />
In any situation where you can use it, its extra DPS.  Usually around 20, which for us is significant.<br />
<br />
It may not compare to Mage, BST and Necro pets, but throwing away extra damage is really stupid.  I'm not even going to touch on pet uses for pulling.<br />
<br />
Learn pet control, get your pet /disc as soon as you can, if you have a hard time with pet control, and keep the little bugger up as much as you can.  <br />
<br />
Your groups will appreciate it when the mobs die quicker:P<br />

<br />
Well I think for me, someone who does play a BST and a MAGE I have compaired the pets and it does blow. I did say that when you really need the extra dps to use it. Untill I was lvl 52 I had no need for it because it isnt a pet that I need like a MAGE ,BST,Necro NEEDS. Now for the 52 pet it seems to work better and matter a bit more in respects to the DPS. When in small groups it is extra DPS and has saved me down time.  When I start working on AAs maybe the pet will be more effective. <br />
I never said that it didnt have a purpose but rather that you can function just fine without it is all..<br />

Thanks for your reply.  I posted my opinion, and besides the fact that I called it a &quot;Complete Guide&quot;, which could have been much more complet, maybe a &quot;Quick Guide&quot;. I wanted to help other future EQers with what I still believe to be a helpful message.<br />
The paper as you stated was how I learned to play a SKand as such is a opinionated paper.  All opinionated replies are much appreciated and accepted for the good and betterment of the SK community. <br />
<br />
Your reply unlike most other replies to my posting was a very fair and professional reply to my opinion.  Other know-it-alls (because they have a higher SK than mine) feel they have the right to bash me, without ever having the courtesy to post their own guide or helpful tactics prior to mine.  They feel they could just sit back and not only scorn this paper but also take personal shots at me (my writing skills).  <br />
<br />
What was important was the paper I wrote and not the skill in which I typed it (they missed the point). Some people should worry less about my writing skill and worry more about their attitude towards other people and maybe the world would be a better place.  If he wants to take the real life role of a characters attitude in a game maybe he should delete his SK and start a new character as a druid (nature lover). <br />
<br />
Thanks for your reply</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">quickling1</div><div class="date">03-19-2004, 07:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well said Hatebrood.  Groff Gorespiller may think he is the moderator for this site, but he tends to be VERY harsh on people.  Maybe he just needs some ass so he won't be so uptight all the time.   Sheesh Groff, give the guy a break.  =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Groff Gorespiller</div><div class="date">03-19-2004, 10:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Quick, Stattic, Hatebrood:<br />
<br />
I'm going to say this once and only once, since you folks are all new here and seemingly haven't a clue.<br />
<br />
I'm not trying to bash any of you, I'm not trying to make you feel bad or piss in your wheaties.  I don't think I'm a mod of anything, nor do I wish to be.  I don't think I'm the god of the class or the most informed person ever to walk the earth.  What I do think is that I have played this game and this class for some time now, and I've been a member of this community for a while and I've discovered a few things from my experience which none of you seem to understand.<br />
<br />
First things first, kudos for being gung ho and trying to help newbs out, but each of you, as you stand at this moment, is a newb to the class and to the community.  There's nothing wrong with that, I was a newb at one point too, and there are still a great many things I don't know.  However, I don't write guides to &quot;explain the great wonders of the class&quot; to all the other uninformed out there when I don't know the answers myself.  <br />
<br />
Second, again I'm not bashing, but all three of you seem to be a little new to message boards, and all of you seem a little young.  Leetspeak, phone text messaging and the like may seem a fun, quick way to communicate, but it's not acceptable in a forum that is persistant.  It's hard to read, and most importantly, it makes the poster look like they're stupid.  To Hatebrood in particular, I will apologize for jumping down your shit about your writing skills, after reading a couple of your posts, it seems that English may not be your first language.  Hell, I don't understand Jupke half the time, but I get by.<br />
<br />
Third, and this is a big one:<br />
Each of you needs to quickly disabuse yourself from the idea that everyone should be politically correct, kind, considerate, patient and giving.  It's a stupid, unrealistic happy-hippy-fuck idea that some of the more rabid liberals and (gasp) the religious right like to throw around in an attempt to cover up the fact that they're out to screw everyone else just as much as the next guy.  We live in a real, harsh, unfriendly, unfair world where there are no happy polite excuses for the crap that happens.  If you can't call it like it is, if you can't handle someone being a little rude or a little blunt, then you're not going to last long, on this message board or in the real world.  People are, for the most part, unhappy, ignorant, greedy, maliscious assholes who find pleasure in grabbing what they can for themselves while stepping on the necks of others who are trying to do the same thing.  It's in our nature, it's what we are, and if you don't get used to it, you're going to be miserable.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for the rest,<br />
<br />
Stattic, <br />
Opinions are like assholes; everyone has one and they all stink.  If Hate had meant it as an exposition on his experiences as a young shadowknight, or if he'd claimed it was opinion only, it would have been mildly flamed and left for dead at the bottom of page 8.  Instead, he got excited and called it &quot;The Complete Shadowknight Guide&quot;.  When I read this the first time, I thought he was posting some excerpt from one of those stupid Power Leveler's websites.  If you want a real &quot;Complete Guide&quot;, read every thread on this site outside of the Flame forum.  Otherwise, just chill out and try and learn something, there's a lot left that you don't know.<br />
<br />
Hate,<br />
I'm glad that you like the class, and that you want to share your experiences and help those who haven't come up to your experience level yet.  It means that at some point, those of us who are &quot;know-it-alls (because they have a higher SK than mine)&quot; won't have to answer as many tired old newb questions, and that the ratio of &quot;SKs suck now because they nerf'd xxyyzz&quot; posts to those that have value will decrease ever so slightly.  Just remember that humility is your friend, and you have a lot to learn, just like I did, and you'll be fine.<br />

Well said Hatebrood.  Groff Gorespiller may think he is the moderator for this site, but he tends to be VERY harsh on people.  Maybe he just needs some ass so he won't be so uptight all the time.   Sheesh Groff, give the guy a break.  =)  <br />
<br />
Groff is harsh on those who come across as arrogant and brash.  Like he was when you bragged about your chars and twinking ideas.  Groff if very helpful if one just asks questions without presumptions.<br />
<br />
Hate:  The guide idea is a good intention.  It may not get as much discussion as you like because all that information is already on this site, and can be found by digging.  If you want to fill out your guide use the search function then if you don't find it ask in the appropriate thread, you may get some heat for asking a question that &quot;everyone&quot; thinks they know the answer to or that has been asked 1000 time before, but it's worth it when you get the proper advice (and usually a bonus piece of advice too).</div></div><hr />

Gnomes and Humans have the same penalty, 0%, and elves have a -10%.  Damned if I can't find that source right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Groff Gorespiller</div><div class="date">03-22-2004, 01:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You're saying that elves have a 10% bonus then?<br />
<br />
I very seriously doubt it.<br />
<br />
I think all elves used to have a slight bonus, but this was removed a while back in favor of &quot;balance&quot; along with the class penalties.<br />
<br />
Halflings have a bonus (don't ask me why), warriors have a bonus (which is why a halfling warrior is the fastest leveling combination of class and race currently in the game, though you rarely see it because of their initial weaknesses).<br />
<br />
Trolls have a 20% penalty, as do Iksar.<br />
<br />
Ogres have a 15% penalty.<br />
<br />
Barbarians have a 5% penalty.<br />
<br />
Those are the only bonuses/penalties left in the game, according to numerous sources.  If you can find a source to verify that elves (DE in particular or elves in general) still benefit from an experience bonus, please do tell.<br />
<br />

 Well you pegged me from the get go didnt ya?<br />
No im not a kid nore am I a newbie. Maybe in your eyes and from YOUR experience I am. I will deal with that as I DONT know everything in the game and havnt been to most/all the zones and Raided my ass off. So from that stand point ya I am a NEWBIE.<br />
Big deal, I have a Freakin Life outside EQ that prevents me from staying at home all fucken day in my stanky sweats playing EQ. <br />
Now if that isnt you then whatever. Im not trying to play GOD or throw my knowlage around. I dont know the facts on the inner workings of the game itself nore do I take it that far. I am spaeking from  MY experience in the game wich may be on a short list vs. some others who have gobbs of time invested in EQ.<br />
<br />
SO be a DICK or dont be a DICK, I really dont care because I think its funny.<br />
<br />
I thinks it's funny that your first reaction to &quot; NOT so correct info&quot; was to just attack them. You know you are a Dick who needs to freakin relax and try to have a bit more tact. I see after other people spoke out that you came back calm and collected. Whatever!<br />
<br />
Feel free to rip on me all you want. I really can give a shit. I like to play EQ in my free time and just have fun with it. This site is great for info and different ideas.<br />
<br />
People ask advise on this site from other players.<br />
If you really want to rip on other peoples opinions rather then  adding to them then go start your own fucking site!!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And yes I like to start shit hehehe.. Dont take me to seriouse =)<br />
THIS IS JUST AN OPINION!!!!!!!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Groff Gorespiller</div><div class="date">03-22-2004, 03:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, I did have you pegged, Stattic.  You're just one in a long string of folks who come around on a fairly consistant basis, throw around the same insults, make the same claims and decry the same tired points, then eventually get tired of people flaming over their heads and go away.<br />
<br />
You see, you're nothing new, you're nothing special, and your &quot;I don't care, I'm not a pathetic loser who spends all his time on EQ&quot; excuses don't hold water.  You see, you came here for information.  You're spending time outside the game trying to find answers to your questions, so you do spend some time on the game.  You may play more than I do.<br />
<br />
Obviously, I've struck a nerve in this post.  You DO care that I've &quot;[been] a DICK&quot;.  It bothers you.  It hurt your feelings and deflated your ego a bit.  Now you're trying to play it back like it doesn't matter, like I have an attitude problem but you're well adjusted enough to let that slide.   Come on, chief.  You'll feel better if you let it all out.  Really.  Have a good cry, rant a little, call me a goat-fucking, mung slurping son of a gutter whore.  That's what you folks usually do when you're backed into this logical corner, and apparently it's very cathartic.<br />
<br />
As for advice, and the difference between advice and opinion, I'll direct you to Mirriam Webster for a definition.  Suffice it to say, opinions are worthless unless they have experience and knowledge to back them up.  I could hold the opinion that you're a flamingly gay retard, but unless someone can provide a photo of you sucking a mongoloid cock on a short bus, it doesn't really mean anything.  And Keveel could add to my opinion that he's fairly certain your mother was part donkey, and that the very fact was what drew your father to her, but again, that wouldn't prove a thing.  See the difference?<br />
<br />
If you want advice, ask for it, but don't expect every asinine opinion offered up to be the best answer.  We have a lot of tards running around on this board, most of whom hold the opinion that they are the smartest human being ever to stumble out of the trailer park and onto a library computer.  Proof not withstanding, I'm pretty sure most of those folks are going to be staring disappointment directly in the face someday soon.<br />
<br />
Have a nice day, neighbor.</div></div><hr />

 I like the way you think. <br />
EGO, no I dont have one of those. As far as striking a nerve.................HMMMMMMMM.........Nope you didnt. <br />
<br />
Did I strike one with you? <br />
<br />
I actually play EQ on a regular basis during the week and maybe I do play more then you, hell I dont know. I only get to post and look around this site when I have free time at work. Anyway you have your way of thinking as do I.<br />
<br />
Im sure if we were on a PvP server together you would come out and kick my ass just to say you did =). <br />

<br />
Hate, though your intentions were of good-nature, what you fail to realize is that the exact information you have provided us(although rather limited and gaped) is widely recognized and is in countless amounts of forums and guide sites..not to mention widely shouted out by experienced players to newbies asking where to level every few minutes. Now I dont pretend to be an experienced player, My main character is a 35 druid( enough said right?) and my newly made sk is only in his third season. But in my spare time I read...alot on everquest and on what I'd like to do next. You wouldnt believe how many times I have seen exactly what you have posted on countless other sites. It gives people the impression that you just copied it from another site to make yourself a hero to the newbies( not accusing you of anything). I dont even need to mention its not a &quot;complete guide&quot; because you have already admited to your error and it no longer matters, but the next time You want to help a newbie, Please save yourself the time, and the flaming and refer them to a more reliable, detailed-filled site. Or possibly even give advice concerning your own personaly experiences.<br />
<br />
Static, I have to completely agree with the others. I know a newb when I see one( no pun intended, being a newb myself I can sense these things =P) and you come across as a rash person, needing desperatly to get that last word in, just as a warning... newbie to newbie... that will get you into a whole lot of trouble.<br />
You may be thinking....what are they going to do about it? this is jus a game... well yes it is.. but surely in whatever server you play in theres always an ever-growing list of people that everyone seems to know and no one likes...think about it<br />
<br />
<br />

**fixed** short term memory loss.. im sorry quick, i was referring to Static.. the error is fixed, sorry for the error</div></div><hr />

 Ive been playing EQ for over a year now. I have a 53 Monk, 45 BST, 56 SK, 40 Mage,30 SHaman......I really wont go to far into the NEWBIE area with me although lots of people have been playing for many years and have more time then I do ...<br />
At that stage I would agree with me being a Newb..<br />
<br />
And your just like the rest of the (COME IN AFTER THE ARGUMENT IS OVER) guys who comes in way late for a sucker punch only to claim the knock out. Give me a fucking break... &quot; your just a NEWBI&quot; is getting old and the joke is fucking over. Many sites share the same info and many people Do ask the same old questions over and over but WHO CARES.  Sorry that it has turned your day upside down. Is funny that I see so many people like Groff going off on everyone. For the most part He only has a negative remark towards people. WHY.?<br />

Each of you needs to quickly disabuse yourself from the idea that everyone should be politically correct, kind, considerate, patient and giving.  It's a stupid, unrealistic happy-hippy-fuck idea that some of the more rabid liberals and (gasp) the religious right like to throw around in an attempt to cover up the fact that they're out to screw everyone else just as much as the next guy.  We live in a real, harsh, unfriendly, unfair world where there are no happy polite excuses for the crap that happens.  If you can't call it like it is, if you can't handle someone being a little rude or a little blunt, then you're not going to last long, on this message board or in the real world.  People are, for the most part, unhappy, ignorant, greedy, maliscious assholes who find pleasure in grabbing what they can for themselves while stepping on the necks of others who are trying to do the same thing.  It's in our nature, it's what we are, and if you don't get used to it, you're going to be miserable.  <br />
