<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nighteyes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">for SKs as most thread i read most people say that toward high lvls STA is the best thing to have stared out with. Not going to say End Game since that is a weird term to me. So so for Iskars balance the STA and INT or go straight STA for the higher life?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rhowne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Depends.  If you want your character to spend more time in the high levels raiding, etc. where your HP count is crucial, then by all means go with maxed out STA.  If you're going to play the character casually and will take longer than 2 months to grind out into the upper 50's, mix and match.  More INT if you solo, more STA if you tank, more STR if you're just in it for dps.<br />
<br />
Just remember that STA over 100 negates the penalties for an empty stamina bar (except for jumping).  Not that it's a huge issue, but it can make a difference if you have a heavy weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lunaticfringesk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">STA all the way and twice on Sunday.  At the end of the day, its one of the hardest stats to increase, to say nothing about maxing it out.<br />
<br />
Iksar have an adequate starting INT to justify not putting any points into it at inception.  The argument that you need more INT to solo doesnt really hold water.  As long as you have enough INT to make it through an encounter with reasonable safety, which IKS do, all a bigger mana pool really means is more downtime medding up to full.<br />
<br />
One could make the arguement, however, that with a bigger HP base, it will take longer to regen that to full.  That would be a true statement.  I have two comments to that effect though.<br />
<br />
Firstly, HP, at any stage of the game, is the single most important factor in the game.  If that hits zero, you lose.  If you run oom, you dont die.  You do, however, if you HP hits zero.  <br />
<br />
Additionally, Ive heard the argument before that one cap &quot;tap HP back&quot; with a larger mana pool, hence put starting points into INT.  That doesnt make a lot of sense though.  Having to tap to get that back has to be more risky than having it in the first place and you then have to sit and regen your mana pool anyways.<br />
<br />
Based on the starting stats of an IKS, put all 20 into STA, no question.  If you plan on &quot;end game&quot; or not.  Its probably the best way to go.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brainbiter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">As a troll I put all my points into INT, as he was my first real toon back in the day.<br />
<br />
Reading up on melee characters, most players say go with STA, I solo a lot and I find I spend more time sitting waiting on my mana bar to refill than my HP bar.<br />
<br />
I understand that at the end game every last HP counts, but have you tried the HP calculator in the archive section of the baords, you are talking about 150hp difference between a Gnome/DE with maxed sta and my troll with maxed int... Let me clarify my Troll still has 150hp more than a Gnome/DE.<br />
<br />
Getting of track here, Stamina is hard to raise but for Large races, who's sta is already far and above small races sta maxed with start points, I would opt for INT over sta. or agi int in the case of an ogre!<br />
<br />
I also use HP and Mana gear over stat gear I founf sta on items does not measure up to raw hp on gear!</div></div><hr />

I chose +15sta because a lot of HP is really needed for iksar SK since we start with such low HP. I found 90sta rather comfortable and havn't havea  problem with a lack of HP.<br />
<br />
I chose +5int because I wanted to get my mana pool up just a bit. I solo most of the time so mana is always a good thing to have. However, since now  a days you can pop into the nexus 24/7 for speed and crack it makes keeping mana up a pretty easy task. Although there have been times that I am glad I have that little extra mana.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Manslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It depends on the level of raiding you plan on doing.  If you are in a high end raiding guild then maxxing sta is a ton easier to max than INT, even for a less physical race such as iksar.  245 sta is far easier to achieve than 277 int.  At least in a high level raiding environment.  That being said, if you don't expect to be in the situation of doing these sorts of raids with the char, but still will be raiding, then STA is a safe bet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Akeikyl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think for smaller race SK's you should focus on getting your STA above 100. Then from there concentrate on raw hp and raw mana balanced with AC till around lvl 50. Of course all SK's should concentrate on raw hp and mana  balanced with AC between lvl's 1 to 50. The sta to hp ratio at this lvl range just isn't enough to warrant all the high STA. One would be better served by Raw HP's. As a previous poster said when you run out of HP's you lose. All that Str and Dex you got will not save you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rhowne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">When I made this character, it was my first melee and I wasn't aware of the benefits to STA over 100 (or how crucial hp's are).  I enjoy a high INT as a Dark Elf and I don't regret it.  In group situations where I tank or pull, the extra 20pts of stamina would have only made the difference... once.  More often, I've found the need for that extra mana to cast a tap, aggro spell, fear, re-snare, or death peace instead.<br />
<br />
Again, it all boils down to personal preference and how you play your character.  :)</div></div><hr />

Sta is a lot easier to max out than int.  If I were able to reroll what I put my starting points into I would put them all into int, and I'm a dark elf.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Manslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Completely agree with Dzenith.  If I could start over all my Starting pts would be in INT.</div></div><hr />

Only change I would have made is to put 5 points into agi...but its easy to get that in gear.  I have spent the last couple of weeks increasing my mana pool and have found it to be a huge help.  Just the increase of 400 mana is has really helped me solo mobs that were just a tad to hard before the increase.  I would go with the 20 points of intelligence.  At 55 20 intelligence = 220 mana while 20 stamina = 88 hit points.  Do the math and take the intelligence.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you two were trying to max out your INT, at the expense of most everything else, you probably would with considerable ease.  I think what you are trying to say is that it is difficult to max out INT, while also maxing out STA/HP (and to a certain degree) AC.  SKs, however, are tanks far more than they are casters.  <br />
<br />
More power to you if you still choose INT.  I will stick with STA every day of the week.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Manslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Actually, I say I would go all INT because atm I am well over max STA buffed.  And am nowhere near max INT.  272 unbuffed STA atm, and have been trying to get rid of STA for raw hp/int/mana/resists etc.  You only need 245 STA to max it with shaman sta buff, you need 277int to max it with C5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>dzenith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Of course if you sacrificed hp, mana and ac gear you could max int.  But you could do the same for any stat.  It's hard to max int while getting good ac and hp/mana items.  Almost all high end melee gear comes with sta on it.  This isn't the case with int.  Also like manslayer mentioned, tali of boar gives you a lot more sta than tranq gives you int, so you need a higher int to max it buffed than you do sta.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Lunaticfringesk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Ive read this thread over and I think that some clarification needs to take place.<br />
<br />
Firstly, the original poster was asking about a IKS SK, not another race.  Clearly, an argument can be made for a orge or a troll SK to change their point allocation and put some into INT.  I wont argue either way, but a case can be made for INT.  For an IKS though?  I'd say, with confidence, STA is the way to go in all but the most extreme cases.<br />
<br />
Additionally, STA is not easy to max out, especially for a smaller race.  Im sorry, but it isnt.  For every one you find that has it maxed out buffed, to say nothing about unbuffed, I'll show you 20 that dont.  As a matter of fact, I (somewhat) like to follow Manslayer's profile (probably because Im /drooling over some of his items) and I can tell you that it wasnt until recently that he achieved even 255 STA unbuffed, and he is an a very strong, &quot;end-game,&quot; guild.  Dont tell me, however, that it is easy to max out, because that wouldnt be a true statement.<br />
<br />
Further, while I can appreciate that point about boar giving you more STA then C5 gives INT, that can be viewed as irrelevant.  What if no SHM or chanter is around?  Then what?  You are SOL??  <br />
<br />
I'm not saying that that fact shouldnt play a role, just dont make it out to be bigger one than it is.<br />
<br />
Im also not certain that it is a true statement that &quot;almost all high end gear comes with STA on it [and that] isnt the case with INT.&quot;  There are quite a few &quot;end-game&quot; items that most SKs would drool over that give either equal to / more INT than STA or give INT and no STA at all.<br />
<br />
For instance, Belt of Dwarf Slaying?  Ring of Destruction?  Belt of Virility?  Petrified Heartwood Flamberge?  Norge'Tal?  As a matter of fact, look at your own gear even!!  There are a number of items giving lots of INT equal to or greater than STA!<br />
<br />
This is just off the top of my head, but I am fairly certain that a detailed review of items would easily prove that INT is definitely not rare amongst high level SK gear.  Perhaps we choose to pick STA items over INT items, therefore there is a perception that it is harder to raise INT than STA.  <br />
<br />
For instance, when you get into a group and group members are deciding who is going to be MT/MA, they dont ask you what your mana pool is.  They typically ask what is your HP and what is your AC.  Play a role perhaps?  Im not certain.  What I am certain of is that there are quite a few items out there that crank up INT that most SKs would be very pleased in wearing.<br />
<br />
It is difficult to argue that one stat is inheritly better than another.  I do believe, however, that STA is the way to go because it is very difficult to max out, but also because I honestly do believe that it is more important than INT (granted, by a very small margin).  I want to crank up my HP far more than I want to crank up my mana.  If someone wants to crank up their mana pool at the expense of HP, go right ahead.  I disagree with that approach, but its all about what makes you happy.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Skek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I was a little different and had the following starting stats....<br />
<br />
Str: 80 + 20 <br />
Sta: 75 <br />
Agi: 90 <br />
Dex: 85 <br />
Wis: 80 <br />
Int: 85 <br />
Cha: 60<br />
<br />
Why did I pick strength... well I basically figured my roll in life was to be an additional damage dealer rather than tank, so figured that more str = more attack.<br />
<br />
Int is way easy to get.  Really your target is still 200 int... anything over that is really grants minimal mana and is a waste unless you are a pure caster.  With other stats in pop now having the potential to reach 305, I don't regret sticking points in str, as even with focus I'm not maxed, so i know the points arn't wasted.  Now imo its darn sight easier to get your int to 200, than it is getting other stats to 305 so therefore points in int are really wasted.<br />
<br />
What I will say on the stamina front is that with AA skills it's possible to raise your stamina by 30 points.  Add in Combat durability and you suddenly have heaps more hp.<br />
<br />
At the end of the day, these points are all pretty meaningless.   A gnome SK is not going to be much more radically different at level 65 to a troll sk.  Really stats are meaningless twaddle which give minimal gains in areas.  Heck ikky's only get 20 points so it ain't really gonna make too much difference where you put them.  20 Int will give you extra mana at low level, but will be meaningless at 65.  20 stamina will give you maybe 100hp which is meaningless to the mob that's quad hitting  you for 700 at 65.<br />
<br />
Add it to whatever you like it doesn't really matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Lizarde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">When I made my Iksar SK, I went the +10 STR, +5 STA, +5 INT route.<br />
<br />
If I could do it over, I'd go +20 STA, or perhaps +15 STA +5 INT.<br />
<br />
Of those three stats, I've found STR to be relatively easy to increase, with STA second easiest and INT third.  But I find that even with 'only' 105 INT, I rarely have problems running LOM or OOM.  With my INT at 120 or better, mana is not a problem.  Hit points are one of those 'more is always better' deals though, IMO.<br />
<br />
Also, with a starting STA of 95, I'd only need +5 STA to get to 100, at which point stamina loss would no longer be a concern.  With my starting STA of 80, I needed to get +20 STA before I got around that small problem.<br />
<br />
So, while you can usually fix any glaring deficiencies in your starting stats over time, I'd rather have to worry less about STA than about the others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Manslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">High INT comes in handy on raids when single mob fights last a fairly long time.  When mana usage excedes your mana regen, mana pool actually matters.  And to adress the fact that I just recently hit 255+ sta was because I chose to just try and stay over 205 pre PoP since I could max it at that point buffed.  245 STA is much easier to attain than 277 INT even as a small race.  And yes there is a handfull of items with high INT, but there are more that have STA, and some of the high INT stuff is ALL/ALL and has like 100+ mana or whatever and pure casters also want it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Int is ignored on most melee gear, whereas sta is on almost all of it.  Many of the items that I have with high int/mana could said to be &quot;caster&quot; gear.   There is a lot more melee gear than caster gear that has shad on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Grimbad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">It'd be a lot easier if you were a Troll, definitely INT there.<br />

Iksar have a harder road to travel than do Trolls though, as Stamina gear on chain items is hard to come by.  Of course, plugging it all into Int, and bragging about being as smart as a dark elf, tougher, and stronger, also has it's appeal...<br />
<br />
If you really are having a hard time deciding, then split it, 10 and 10, that way you were only off by 10 points, which you can get in 5AA if it comes out to be that big of a deal, and we can all agree, I'm sure, that as long as you go Sta, Int, or mix, that you're better off than using it for anything else.<br />
<br />
In the end, though, it's not THAT big of a deal, since we only get 20 to play with in the first place.,</div></div><hr />

My starting int is 109, my starting sta is 70.  I have tried to get items with int/mana on it as opposed to just sta/hp.  The result is that I have 219 sta and 214 int.  <br />
<br />
For every piece of high end equipment you can show me with decent int on it that a shad can wear, I can show you 3 pieces that has much higher sta than int.  <br />
<br />
Let's do a high end BP comparison:<br />
<br />
BP of Eradication: 15sta 100hp no int/mana<br />
Vindi BP: 15sta 100hp no int/mana<br />
BP of Void: 25sta 8int 115hp 75mana<br />
BP of Speed: 15sta 8int 125hp 75mana<br />
Great Shadow BP: 25sta 15int 125hp/125mana<br />
<br />
Every bp has much higher sta than int and hp than mana (except the GSBP which is even hp/mana).  I could do a similar comparison on almost every piece of our armor.  Please, show me the good armor that is easier to get int than sta on, I would like to know as I am kind of a mana junky.</div></div><hr />

Wrongo Dongo on both accounts.  <br />
Stamina items are easier to get than intelligence items.  I am not talking lower end items. I am talking items with at least 10 stamina or 10 intelligence.  It is easier to raise stamina than it is intelligence while keeping your ac and hp at a respectable level.<br />
<br />
At 50 level the mana pool equation is: (this is the equation that I have worked out and seems pretty close)<br />
(.2 * int)50 = base mana pool.<br />
<br />
At level 55 its<br />
(.22 * int)55 = base mana pool<br />
<br />
That means without an intelligence increase I gain 132 mana from level 50-55.  It also means at level 55 I will receive 12 mana every point of intelligence increase. <br />
<br />
You can see that int will give you an ever expanding mana pool (er till 65 level) while a mana item is a set amount.  I beleive that having mana items is nice but with the increases given to the mana pool from the int stat makes it more important than mana items until your intelligence is maxed.  Note that pre 50 the opposite is true and mana &gt; int but levels 1-49 are just training anyway.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway those are my thoughts.</div></div><hr />

Now, you want to tell me where in that comment is states that STA is harder / easier to increase over INT?  As a matter of fact, I dont believe I have made any conclusion as to such.  I have merely stated that STA is one of the hardest stats to max out, especially for a smaller race.  Lets try and read and interpret what is stated, not what you want it to say, especially you &quot;dongo&quot;.<br />
<br />
If you want to discuss what is actually typed above, I will do so every day of the week, because that is NOT a fact.  INT is not ignored on most melee gear.<br />
<br />
In regards to the mana ratio, I have not seen that formula before, which probably makes sense, as &quot;dongo&quot; developed it (at least, based on what he typed).  The formula that I once saw, and interpreted, may in fact be outdated.  Any reference to your formula?  That comment, however, is just icing on the cake.  I still wouldnt trade out STA for INT.  If someone wants to go the INT route, go for it.  It doesnt effect me in the slightest.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Manslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Well it seems to me every time i get an upgrade it seems to have STA on it even though I generally look for stuff with raw hp/mana/int/etc.  Out of every inventory slot I have I have 3 items with equal INT and STA and 2 Items with more INT than STA, and I have actively been trying to get more FT/INT/Mana/Resists etc while directly willing to sacrifice STA to do so.  The list of items you listed are either ALL/ALL so somewhat difficult to get, or outdated weapons in the high end game.  And that was my whole point.  INT is much harder to max than STA for the upper end of raiding people, the more casual player probably won't max either.  As it stands now, I have 37 STA that is essentially wasted, while needing 78 INT to max.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Lunaticfringesk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Ya crack me up bro  =P<br />
<br />
You are in such an enviable position.  Not only can you max out STA rather easily, you get to pick and choose how you increase your INT going forward in an effort to max it out.  I guess I view it that if you put all 20 points into STA, you would be in this position a lot sooner and, therefore, could channel your efforts sooner.<br />
<br />
I also suppose that I live by the adage that levels and HP (and AC, to a certain degree, as it has a direct impact on HP) are &quot;everything.&quot;  I want to be in the position you are in as quick as possible.  I believe that there would be little argument that you get there quickest by putting all points into STA.<br />
<br />
I never stated that STA is harder to max than INT.  I merely stated that STA is not easy to max out, especially for a small race.  How one defines &quot;easy,&quot; however, is subject to a lot of interpretation.  What some may view as &quot;easy,&quot; others may not.<br />

Also, mana pool just isnt super high on my priority list.  Mana regen is far more important to me.  The only (significant) argument that I have heard in favor of a large mana pool is during a raid with lots of down time (to med to full).  It borders on worthless in a xp situation, however, as the bigger the mana pool, the longer the downtime to regen it.  Hence, mana regen just takes the cake for me when it comes to mana.<br />

Also, I believe that you (and the group) will reap more benefits of increased HP (over increased mana) in a xp situation.  The CLR can consistently start his CH just a little bit later ( in theory) every time.  A few extra seconds can and do make a big difference sometimes.  Over time, it just seems that it would add up.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>dzenith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Mana pool isn't as important of a factor as mana regen in exp groups or pre-pop raids where boss mobs took 15+ mins to kill.  However, when the fights shorten to be between 1-10 mins like are common in PoP and you want to dump all of your mana into damage, the size of the pool becomes increasingly more important than the regen, since the amount you burn is much greater than the rate you can get it back.  I'm not saying that mana regen becomes useless, but as fights shorten you get much less of a return from having it, whereas a mana pool is static despite what you fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Pimedus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">ok darnit now you're making me question myself... i made a troll and went all STA :/, should i REALLY restart and go all INT? i'm only 30 but still... as for highend game, i might reach it, i might not, who knows...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Gorrum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I play an ogre and went all points in int. I solo quite a bit and the int makes it easier. One thought : If I'am fear kiting I need mana to keep snare, fear, taps and spears going. As well I'am not being hit as much. IE: in that example mana is more important than hps. Sadly, we can't fear kite 55+ mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Manslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">For soloing mana regen is more important than total mana since everyone meds at the same rate etc.  High Int is very good on raids where your mana usage is greater than your mana regen and fight lasts awhile.  More mana = more dots/nukes etc.</div></div><hr />
