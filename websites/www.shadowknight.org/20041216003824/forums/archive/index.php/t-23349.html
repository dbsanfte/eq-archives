<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vothoz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I had a druid friend (who has never killed vampires in TM) help me start the MQ for the shield.  Quest started normally with Phenic with Druid doing the quest....  went to Shadowhaven, came back to Katta.  Here's a summary of what happened:<br />
<br />
---Phenic started the quest.. went to Shadowhaven...<br />
<br />
---Got a list of names back from Record Keeper--- You gain experience!! <br />
<br />
---Got back to Phenic and gave him the list of names, druid got a Badge of Service--- <br />
<br />
---Went to Nathyn to turn in Badge.. Nathyn said &quot;i do not need this at this time&quot;...<br />
<br />
<br />
THAT was where the problem is.  Woodelf Druid conned Dubious for some reason and I also conned Dubious (Iksar Shadowknight).  When Nathyn was hailed by me and the druid, he did not respond.  Does this part of the quest require faction work?<br />
<br />
We gated back to PoK and picked up an Inviser to try the invis-during-hand-in trick but by the time we came back, Nathyn had depoped.  The druid ran the quest all over again by hailing Phenic to see if Nathyn will respawn, but he did not respawn for over 30 mins.. so we left.<br />
<br />
I'm hoping someone can shed some light on this situation.  I would hate for my friend who's helping me MQ this kill vampires in TM just to raise her faction for MY quest.  <br />
<br />
Lastly, when and how long is Nathyn's respawn?  I was disappointed I couldn't do the quest last night... I was hoping I could spend 2 hours and get my shield like most of the posts said.  Anyhow, thanks for any help I can get.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kelv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don´t think Nathyn despawns, but people do kill him for a 100 charisma enchanter robe.<br />
<br />
You can get faction up killing somewhere else in Katta, just watch for the &quot;You gain faction with Nathyn Iluminous&quot; message.<br />
<br />
And why on earth did you go get an inviser if you had a druid with you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vothoz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hey thanks for the reply.  To answer your question, I'm pretty sure Nathyn was not killed because we left Katta for only about 5 minutes, and the time we were there and came back, no one was in the zone.  We got another inviser because druid conned Dubious as did I.  <br />
<br />
I was under the assumptions that good race/class can do this quest without additional faction work because none of the write up says anything about improving on this faction.  Appearantly there's something missing about this step.  <br />
<br />
I got the additional inviser because the Druid had the NO DROP badge, and she's suppose to hand it into Nathyn - who wouldn't acknowledge her or take the badge to continue the quest.  So I thought if she was doing the turn-in and someone else invised her prior to the turn-in (thus making her indifferent), she can continue the quest.  That is why i got another inviser.  <br />
<br />
Any other help?  Can i somehow use any tricks to skip factioning for Nathyn?  BTW what is the respawn time on Nathyn?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help there is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shaithiss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Worst part I've noticed about the quest, is I've been turning in teeth / ashes / blood to raise Magus Conlegium faction.... which is also lowering Nathyn faction. Luckily mass slaughtering the vamps raises Nathyn faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The only thing I can think of is that the first Nathyn encountered was actually the '2nd Nathyn&quot;.  When someone hands in the badge to Nathyn, a 2nd one insta-pops.  This 2nd one might not accept the badge 'again' in this state.  If the turn in doesn't work the next time you try, I'd possibly suggest starting over at this point (not much to lose)... I've heard stories of the badge not being the right one [somehow], but personally I never ran into anything similar and I did this quest via MQ several times.</div></div><hr />
