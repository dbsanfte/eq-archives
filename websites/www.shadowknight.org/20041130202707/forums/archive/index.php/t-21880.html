<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">There are currently two tanking gaps between the three tank classes that must be addressed. One gap between Shadowknights and Paladins, and another between Warriors and Knights in general. These issues cannot be treated entirely independently from one another.<br />
<br />
- Link the paladin Force of XXX line of stuns so that only one can be used at a time.  This would give high-level Paladins a single line of stuns progressively upgraded to keep up with level increases.  Upgrades should not increase in power, as the effects of stun spells scale to mob DPS.  <br />
<br />
- Replace the paladin Quellious' Word line (10.0 sec stuns) with a 0.0 sec stun with a high resist mod and low cast/recast time and a moderate mana drain.  Approximate mana drain could range from the level 54 Quellious' Word of Tranquility at 65 mana to the level 69 Quellious' Word of Tranquility at 115 mana, with possible tweaking needed to the numbers depending on the final cast and recast times.  These spells would fill paladin role of interrupting casters.<br />
<br />
- Add a “Recourse Box” – a buff window specifically for recourse effects.  <br />
<br />
- Give Shadowknights a 20% accuracy debuff with high aggro.  18 sec duration, 12 sec recast, 1 sec cast, -55 resist check to magic, equivalent restrictions to paladin stuns. The high aggro is essential to prevent it from becoming a support spell – furthermore, it would be a welcome boost to aggro generation for Shadowknights.  <br />
<br />
This should be a new spell line rather than a single spell.  Its max level should increase progressively along with paladin stuns, but its power should remain constant, as its effect scales with mob damage output.  <br />
<br />
Note that a Paladin chain casting the remaining line of stuns would avoid 31% of melee damage, barring interrupts, fizzles, and resists.  Shadowknight’s lower percentage of avoidance would be balanced by its greater reliability (duration exceeds recast by 4*cast time) and the spell Aura of Pain.<br />
<br />
- Give knights two disciplines to return them to their offtanking role.  <br />
--- Melee immunity discipline: shield block (thus shield must be equipped), 18 second duration, 40 minute reuse.  <br />
--- DI-mitigation discipline: 30-35% DI-mitigation, 72-second duration, 4.5-minute reuse, shield required.  <br />
<br />
They should be on separate reuse timers, but the mitigation discipline may share the reuse timer of the current defensively oriented knight disciplines.<br />
<br />
Note that the mitigation discipline would have a lower total active time than defensive, in addition to mitigating notably less.  If used whenever available, Defensive is active 28.57% of the time; the knight discipline would be active 26.66% of the time.<br />
<br />
- Allow Shadowknights access to the Stonewall AA ability. <br />
<br />
- Change the Malo lines of spells to debuff disease.  It is the one resist that is not debuffed by the spell line and there is no justification for this.  Disease is behind every other resist in the extent to which it is debuffed on raids, and it is the resist on which Shadowknights rely most heavily.  <br />
<br />
- Put Spell Casting Subtlety on a toggle; as it stands, purchasing the AA is detrimental.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Paladin stuns are at the root of a lot of the current class balance problems for the tank classes.  The number of usable stuns varies by mob level and they are extremely powerful against blue trash mobs and the like, are entirely useless against immune mobs, and address only part of the problem with others (incoming DPS vs. being one-rounded).  The above changes would reduce paladin reliance on stuns and make their impact more consistent.  Currently, the impact of stuns varies greatly from mob to mob depending on level, immunity, resistance, etc.   Paladins would be compensated for the lost stun power with the much-needed tanking disciplines.  <br />
<br />
Shadowknights would be brought into line with paladins through the accuracy debuff, which would effectively parallel paladin stuns.  These abilities, together with the rapid-fire mitigation discipline, would cement knights in their traditional offtanking roles while having little impact on the traditional warrior role of raid main tanking.  All three tank classes would be viable for single group content.  <br />
<br />
Note that this would actually be an improvement for warriors in a group setting in terms of power relative to Paladins, as stuns in their current state are potentially very overpowered against common XP mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The Accuracy debuff is a really interesting concept, but are you certain that mobs even have an accuracy variable to debuff in a way that would work as this is intended?<br />
<br />
Also, if it did, it is likely that we would end up just debuffing this for a Warrior tank and then FDing aggro over to them in many or most cases...no?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Skvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">- Give knights two disciplines to return them to their offtanking role.  <br />

<br />
Again SJ , as i posted on the last thread discs that require a shield will do nothing to help narrow the gap in tanking between warriors, Paladins and SKs. The 1hander + shield options are amazingly poor until some fairly high level raid content. The problem is not so much the shields (Tae Ew Shield for example is easily obtainable or can be purchased in the bazaar fairly cheaply) but the 1handers that are available pretty much suck ass (Longblade of Vitality is argueably one of the best dropable 1handers :( )when compared to two handers.<br />
<br />
The DI-mitigation disc should not be restricted to having a shield equiped IMHO</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you're buying your 1 handers and shields in the bazaar, then you lack the experience and progression thus far to really understand the tanking issues that are the concern here. Nobody is really worried about retuning Bastion of Thunder nameds or LDoN hard adventures here. Making that content even easier would be a by-product of fixes to knight tanking/offtanking in the higher end GoD content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Skvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Arr I see, thought this was about class balance for a wide spectrum of SKs to close the gap in tanking between the 3 plate tanking class's. Did not realise that this was all about closing the tanking gap of the 3 tanking class's only in high end raiding.<br />
<br />
Failure to make it accross the board basically is saying. 'tough shit, your an SK and as such you can remain at the bottom of the tanking power list until you are in a raiding guild that can equip you.' <br />
<br />
Its somewhere around cursed cycle before a decent 1 hander drops along the progression path so until a guild can do that your saying Sks should be the worst of the tanking class's...thanks for nothing for the little guy that also wants to offtank mobs in content they are doing without the healers groaning in the background that its an SK doing that job and not a warrior or Paladin.<br />
<br />
Sure the content I am talking about there is WAY less need than at the higher levels, the tanking class disparity created by the over balancing of warriors does not start in GoD. GoD merely made it obvious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There really isn't any content that demands more than is doable by a SK playing at your level with the impressive collection of LDoN gear that you have. You are doing better than older SKs were facing the content that you are, there is no crisis in the older content. If the SK changes needed don't seem tailored to your situation, it is probably because you aren't really at a place where the class is experiencing sizable problems. We all made our way through early progression back when the gear was not as generous-- you're having it easier already, do you understand?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Skvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Bah edited my reply as you were posting..sorry !<br />
<br />
Sure I understand. I also understand that that while it may not be needed where I am in the game and the tanking differences are not as obvious they still exist. I honestly thought this was about balancing the differences accross a much wider spectrum of players. You know accross the same spectrum that warrior overbalancing took place. Do you understand that ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Casual SKs will get the improvements (or access to improvements through AA or Disciplines) the same as higher progression SKs will...the game doesnt make those sort of distinctions aside from the availibility of spells and gear.<br />
<br />
I'm mainly an advocate of reworking our innate mitigation tables before trying to incorporate bonuses from shields or whatever.<br />
<br />
If a shield bonus of some sort is introduced (the original point of disagreement we have here), then the basic disadvantage this poses to casual/early progression SKs is the quality of 1h/shield combos. This is not a big loss really-- the content that such players are facing doesn't necessitate tanking improvements to a large degree. However, as content scales up, the utillity of such a bonus and the gear that would facilitate it both improve. Basically, it would become more viable as you progress.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Skvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Arr I see more clearly what you are saying now. It still does not address the balance of tanking power at a lower level of progression. Warriors are still supreme (and should be) Paladins have less issues as almost everything at this level of progression can be stunned and SKs ...well SKs while more than capable of offtanking / pinch hitting tanking come in a distant 3rd with no means of mitigating damage.<br />
<br />
I dont think there is a good case for a DI mitigation disc being restricted to 1hander + shield combinations regardless of content</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Synapticus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I agree with certain aspects of your proposals SJ.<br />
1)  giving intermediate-acting melee mitigation and quick-acting melee immunity type disc to Knights, to enhance the role as an off-tanking class is a welcome addition.   <br />
However i dont see the point of requiring them to hold a shield.  Shields should have other benefits outside of any defensive Disc.<br />
I think any shield bonuses should be accessible to all tanking classes, including warriors.<br />
2)  In addition to close up the SK/Pally tanking gap, a high-aggro accuracy debuff that parallels Pally stuns in level limits would be very fair and balanced.  Currently, there are no classes with the ability to reduces a mob's accuracy via spell  (haha watch them give it to an already over-powered class in the next expansion).  Heck, why not make it an accuracy TAP.  That alone would be enough. However, there really isnt a need to reduce pally stun power if an accuracy tap/debuff was implemented.<br />
3)  stonewall AA to SK's - i agree 150%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The fact that the 1h options available at the low end isn't really relivant.  As has been stated, the issues are worst at the high end for a number of reasons, and it's not a content issue - 1) low end SK's &amp; warriors share itemization (both wear the same suit of LDoN gear, for example) - High-end do not.  2) Low end SK's spells are much more powerful for the content than high-end SK's because they do not scale.  Furthermore, the discs aren't something to be used constantly - if you're in a situation that warrents one, you can switch it out.  The part of the change that's most important to the lower-end SK's is the stun &quot;nerf&quot; and the accuracy debuff.<br />
<br />
Oh, and for the record, Cudgel of the Oppressor + Pockmarked Aegis is fairly equivilant to the elemental level 1h/shield combos and available to the higher-end non-raiding knights; the bar would be lowered a bit in terms of gear for their acquisition were these changes to go into effect also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well I have been thinking about this and I am wondering if our festering upgrade could have something like this added.<br />
<br />
Since I usually tag with festering if it had some type of short acting pre-slow to it maybe like 35% to 45 % slow it sure would take the edge of these hard hitting GoD mobs until they get slowed.<br />
<br />
Since it would be short duration I dont think it would be that much of an unbalance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">That would leave us inferior to pallys against stunnables... there are a few implimentation problems with it too.<br />
<br />
There really needs to be a reworking of knight tanking to reduce paladins' reliance on stuns.  Stuns are a huge albatross around the necks of both of the knight classes.  Their unparalleled potential for power against blue XP mobs is the major roadblock for meaningful tanking upgrades.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I don't think any other class would really feel the same way on that...<br />
<br />
Plus, bunching a snare and slow into one spell like that would make sort of a mess of the resist and immunity issues, wouldn't it?<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, it sounds great. But usually that means that it will never happen...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">i don't like the idea of shield requiring discs.<br />
<br />
no other classes that i know of require a certain piece of equipment or set up to use their discs, and it removes the ability to use it in &quot;oh shit&quot; situations when you're wielding a 2her.<br />
<br />
also, i can't think of any valid reason to require a shield. the block disc may seem like it should require a shield, but we don't even get to block with a shield as it is so that's not really any more valid than blocking with a 2her or your fists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kalendrox Grimblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I think the point SJ is trying to make is that if there isn't some kind of restriction (even a little one like having to have a shield equipped) there is very little chance of us getting 1 of these discs, much less both.<br />
<br />
It still does not address the balance of tanking power at a lower level of progression. Warriors are still supreme (and should be) Paladins have less issues as almost everything at this level of progression can be stunned and SKs ...well SKs while more than capable of offtanking / pinch hitting tanking come in a distant 3rd with no means of mitigating damage. <br />
<br />
Damage mitigation really dosen't play a large role in lower end content.  Do you see warriors hitting defensive as soon as it pops in PoD?  Or pallys chain stunning?  No, because its really not needed.  When a mob hits for 200, even in bazaar gear, its not a huge issue.  When a mob hits for 2000, even with time gear, its a huge issue.  The changes would make GoD content doable by shadowknights without totally gimping pallys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Shizzythugmasta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Actually, if u think about it, a pally could tank semi naked for a group in cloth armor if he had VoQ/Pot9/Spiritual Radiance in PoD, especially if the mob was pulled with malo/tash.  That is in and of it self unfair. <br />
I guess I could fear kite naked with a sword with those buffs, except I don't think that would work in many exp places i would take a group or be able to go to and find a group.  Oh i guess i could solo then or agro kite, though since the mobs are fearable its hard to hold agro.  Pally stuns are unfair to any other exp tank, especially at that level.  I guess my killer 75dmg life tap will save me when it casts so slow i can get hit 4 times for 200+ when i cast.  Oh and i guess a life leech to take a bubble of mana every couple mins too.  Oh and since lifetap agro sucks i'd lose agro on teh group and they'd either leave cuz i sucked or invite a pally.   I love being a shadowknight but thats just not balanced at all.  Not at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The accuracy doesn't work well in my mind but giving it a shot. <br />
<br />
I've been grouping with a guild paladin + other members for last 3 days getting him from lvl 63 to 65 and others lvls too in random tier 2-3 zones. The paladin stun is intresting, in theory it doesn't make them tank better like our AoP makes us tank better, but it does by them time to do other things like save a slower/caster/priest who gets agro. I was teaching the paladin for instance to assist the chanter when i brought in multiple mobs and stun the one the chanter would mez incase mez was resisted or such, told the pal to quick heal chanter if chanter took damage (pal didn't do this to well actually but that was i think the player not the class). The Paladin would also use his stun (only used non damage 4 sec stun really cuz other has knockback and damage) help me tank, what i was thinking he could do is say im getting low on life and a heal seems to be coming late he can try to stun and by me 4 secs to get that heal off. The paladin stun wasn't such insane agro that he couldn't use it for utility but it also wasn't a fire and forget type of thing like slow is. Okay so this is what i experienced with the paladin stun.<br />
<br />
So what do we need? High agro spell relative to stun agro ie not super agro but enough agro that casting it will result in tanking if desired or using it in a utility sitution may result in accidental tanking by stealing agro. It needs to be short duration with like 2x recast to make it so its only used on one mob and that we have to be there for that mob, typically in tanking or offtanking role but with some minor utility for another tank if we want to. We dont want to be beastlords casting slow on inc on every single mob and off tanking the occasional agro. Im not sure what im thinking of yet that an sk could use to do this besides fear2 (which i love the idea of that one *and make our terror line the fear2 line*)<br />
<br />
Using the accuracy debuff idea though im gonna try and make what i think would do what im thinking.<br />
<br />
1-2 sec cast time or 3sec cast time, prefer 3 sec (so spell haste works sorta).<br />
decrease accuracry by 50% (not sure on this number, when a pally mob is stunned its not hitting them at all so kinda want something balanced to that, when its not hitting the cleric, chanter a pal stun is doing Alot more good then a mob hitting a cleric, chanter 50% less.)<br />
6 sec duration  12-18 sec recast (not sure on these numbers in my head im playing around with low duration faster recast = more agro less likey to be used as a debuff for a war tank, but who wants to be casting teh same spell every 2dur/6re-4dur/8re secs?) <br />
<br />
Of course their is the issue of them being chained on a raid to make the mob gimp the whole fight so first make it when chained they are more agro then a war should be able to steal...(doesnt really fix the gimping issue) and make it so that all important raid mobs, and even very very important *planned singel group event mobs* are immune to it like stun is balanced now heh. <br />
<br />
Oh well this is just my 2cp after grouping with a paladin. Im starting to enjoy what my sk can do for my guild atm (though this is more me as a person and me as a cleric) but at the same time im starting to like the paladins abilities more and more... to the point kinda where if a guildie was quitting and offered account i'd probably pay for it heh to learn what i could possible do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Go exp in KT and tell us it dosen't make them tank better~<br />
<br />
I think the main complaint here is that while the benefits in early PoP and earlier expansions arent insane, they are in GoD.  Imagine taking an unslowable mob that quads for 1200+ and stunning it for 5 seconds.  Thats an assload of damage you're avoiding with 1 simple spell.  Add that to the 4 or 5 stuns that pallys have at their disposal and its reaching the level of game-altering and overpowered.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  ok, I just finished reading the above post and... damn, i don't even know where to start.<br />
<br />
So what do we need? High agro spell relative to stun agro ie not super agro but enough agro that casting it will result in tanking if desired or using it in a utility sitution may result in accidental tanking by stealing agro. <br />
You want to balance pally stun mitigation by giving us an aggro spell?  We have assloads of aggro spells, and they work fine (cept terrors of course, but everyone knows that).<br />
It needs to be short duration with like 2x recast to make it so its only used on one mob and that we have to be there for that mob, typically in tanking or offtanking role but with some minor utility for another tank if we want to. <br />
What does duration have to do with an aggro spell?<br />
 We dont want to be beastlords casting slow on inc on every single mob and off tanking the occasional agro. Im not sure what im thinking of yet that an sk could use to do this besides fear2 (which i love the idea of that one *and make our terror line the fear2 line* <br />
Umm... I really like it when people slow the mobs before they start pounding on me~  And there is no Fear2 line, fear2 is a single spell.  I would classify us getting Fear2 as being a quick, patch fix, not anything close to a real solution (you could just add a spinstun to terrors and boom, youve got fear2, plus the aggro from the terrors).<br />
1-2 sec cast time or 3sec cast time, prefer 3 sec (so spell haste works sorta). <br />
Logic~ You would prefer a 3 second cast (minus haste) to a 1 second cast?<br />
decrease accuracry by 50% (not sure on this number, when a pally mob is stunned its not hitting them  <br />
50 is way too much.  most mobs miss 50% of the time anyways.<br />
(not sure on this number, when a pally mob is stunned its not hitting them at all so kinda want something balanced to that, when its not hitting the cleric, chanter a pal stun is doing Alot more good then a mob hitting a cleric, chanter 50% less.) <br />
Thank you, Captain Obvious.<br />
less likey to be used as a debuff for a war tank <br />
However much aggro it generates, guilds will use this on major mobs.  I forsee guilds recruiting SKs solely for the purpose of chaining this.  Even if its insanely ultimate aggro and the SK dies everytime they cast.  SoE would have to add immunity checks for every mob, like they do with snare and slow.<br />
I don't mean to sound like more of an asshole than I already am, but if you're nightly group exp spot is PoV or lower, you really aren't seeing this the way that everyone else is.  I'm not saying that your ideas will be bad, you just don't have the same perspective of the problem that the higher tiered tanks have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Elkar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I believe the high agro is there in the proposal to prevent it from being overpowering when using in conjunction with a warrior, i.e. you will pull the mob off a warrior if you tried to use it to diminish the DPS on him.<br />
<br />
If it wasn't high agro, you could have a knight and a warrior in a group tackle content much higher that current design allows by mitigating too much damage to the tank.</div></div><hr />

<br />
why? because SKs shouldn't be using 1h + shield generally? you think anyone gives a fuck about this and is going to say &quot;oh, well they have to equip a shield, sure they can have the discs&quot;. seriously, just think about it. while WE know and view it as a restriction, i bet it wouldn't change the opinion of 95+% of nonknights regarding us getting a melee disc.<br />
<br />
anyway, we're well overdue for an ungimped mitigation or avoidance disc. and i still can't think of a logical reason to have it come pregimped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Klang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">&gt;- Give knights two disciplines to return them to their offtanking role. <br />

<br />
   I really don't want to be &quot;required&quot; to use a shield to use any particular<br />

I said i'd prefer they just make terrors to fear2 but all i said in my other post was in regards of how i think the accurcary debuff option should be made. Not a long lasting debuff a short high agro debuff so that as elkar understood couldn't be used to allow a warrior to take advantage of to tank really. I also wanted it to have same restrictions as a stun (not be level based/since we only have one spell) but make important mobs immune to it like raid mobs or even single group content that is supposed to be challenging.<br />
<br />
The paladin i was grouped with was a worse tank then me he was newly 65 where as im 65 with 260aa and better gear. He was off tanking when we had multiple mobs (often) and mez tanking for chanter (when we had a chanter) via stun. Also he would contribute to stunning the mob i was on while he dps'd but he couldn't go balls out with doing that cuz if he did he would steal agro.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Other tanking discs have some sort of penalty - requiring a shield for our tanking disc is logical.  Warriors are forced to carry multiple weapon setups, it's fair and balanced that we would be too.  It's also fair in that its a bit less beneficial in the level of the game where we have the least trouble - the low end.  This isn't a matter of content or anything either, it's a product of our non-scaling lifetaps and other abilities; low end SK's, while still suffering a bit, don't have the same level of imbalance as higher end SK's who are competing with scaling abilities using the same non-scaling abilities the low-enders are.  <br />
<br />
Regarding giving it a 3min duration/10min reuse, that's exactly the wrong way of going about it.  Then you have the exact &quot;light defensive&quot; we've been trying to get away from.  We don't want a watered down warrior discipline, we need something tuned to our role.  Warriors tank the big mobs; they need the long lasting disc.  Knights are offtanks, we need something that can be used rapid-fire as new waves of mobs come into the camp.  As I described in the original post, our discipline would have slightly less active time than Defensive/Stonewall, not to mention its lower mitigation percentage.  <br />
<br />
As for fear2, I thought alot about it and even supported a fear2 type spell for awhile, but if you look at the bigger picture, it just isn't the right way to go about it.  Fear2 would just be propagating the problem - fear2 is essentially a stun, and stuns are why knights are such a mess.  We need to reduce the impact of stuns, not expand it.  <br />
<br />
As for the accuracy debuff, I spent a decent amount of time trying to balance the numbers and I'm confident that that's the best percentage/duration/cast/recast from a balance standpoint.  The cast and recast are the same as the line of pally stuns that would remain; the duration is sufficient to make it reliable, and the debuff percentage is just right to make it balanced factoring in Aura of Pain and it's slight reliability advantage over pally stuns.  As long as equivilant restrictions were placed on it as pally stuns (could probably even tie it to a 0.0 sec stun, but that's taking the easy way out) it would be a very well balanced spell.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The main thing I'm still debating is whether the discs (particularly the mitigation disc, the other it's rather a moot point) should run off endurance or mana, and how high the cost should be.  There are distinct advantages either way, and I havn't really determined which is the better route - I'm certainly open to commentary on this, as I need to have it squared away by the time I hit 3.0 (the final version, theoretically at least).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Vindarius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Not sure I can offer much to the mana versus endurance question other than I have far more issues with mana (i.e. LOM) than endurance and therefore just for pure convenience sake, would prefer to see it be tied to endurance.<br />
<br />
As to the rest, SJ, I think you're gettin close to nailin' it - nice job.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I guess I'll expand on the mana vs endurance...<br />
<br />
1) Endurance is sorta the &quot;mana of the pure melee's&quot; - well, we have mana, so it seems logical/fair that ours would use mana.<br />
<br />
2) There are a fuckton of ways to regen mana, and none for endurance.  I havn't decided which option this makes a case for, once I do, I'll probably have my answer.<br />
<br />
3) SK-specific gear generally has mana, but not endurance... be nice to draw from the larger pool.  <br />
<br />
4) Endurance is basically useless to us... again, I havn't decided which option this makes a case for, and the answer to that question will be a big factor in which I decide is best.<br />
<br />
Of course, after I determine which they should draw from, I have to figure out how much it'll cost (approximately at least)...<br />
<br />
Note that I'm currently leaning in favor of Mana, but I'm not decided on that yet - like I said, commentary on that is encouraged.</div></div><hr />

That's about the worst justification for that decision possible.  Endurance is to pure melee's as mana is to knights.  They have endurance on their gear, we have mana on ours; they have endurance regen AA's, we have mana regen.  Making it &quot;in line&quot; with pure melees' discs would probably mean to make it mana based.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>velourea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">The Accuracy debuff is a really interesting concept, but are you certain that mobs even have an accuracy variable to debuff in a way that would work as this is intended?<br />
<br />
Also, if it did, it is likely that we would end up just debuffing this for a Warrior tank and then FDing aggro over to them in many or most cases...no?<br />
this point needs to be addressed. even with the &quot;high agro&quot;, FD is a short cast away. a possible solution, altough i dont think eq programming has any accuracy variable to debuff at all, is to have the accuracy debuff only work when the mob is swinging at the SK. either way, the coding required for such a feat is something i dont think the dev´s are going to want to do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for whether or not you can have an accuracy debuff, I expect they can, and when I talked to Brael about it he figured they probably can too.  If not, there is the possibility of doing it via an avoidance recourse, but it's alot more complex and would have some implimentation problems...<br />
<br />
Note that an avoidance buff (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5390&amp;source=Test) will go live with OoW; there are avoidance and accuracy mods on Time+ gear, etc.  I would be surprised if they didn't have the means to code it.</div></div><hr />

Actually slein do you think an accuracy debuff needs to have level restrictions like stuns do at this time?

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">It's not like you can use these spells on raid mobs anyway; you can't be dedicating multiple offtanks to a single mob - the fact that shadowknights offtank at all is a testiment to the fact that tanks aren't in an overabundance.  Besides, I don't think it's a bad thing if multiple tanks can work hard on the same mob.  It won't be a factor in XP groups, it won't be a factor on raid named, it will only stand to effect raid trash.  <br />
<br />
The problem with stuns isn't that multiple pallys can stun the same mob, the problem is that one pally can stun some mobs into complete submission and be completely useless against others.  <br />
<br />
I'd rather they fixed terrors than changing them to a spell line I'd rather not have.  We do not need stuns; we need something to compete with them yes, but we don't need to have what would be a pally stun with a different name.  We will need better aggro spells soon, however.  With the mudflation of aggro, CD/fear will only hold up for so long before they're no longer sufficient to do the job - terrors need to be tuned to do the job.<br />

<br />

I can understand wanting an invul melee ability, and hell even with my suggestions it could still be warranted possibly (but making it shield only is gay)<br />

Your mitigation disc would give an enhancement to offtanking only and be of less usefulness while pulling than my disc.  While yours would be of higher usefulness in raids on trash mobs thats not where a Paladins stun advantage is at its highest, that advantage is in exp groups which is where mine would be providing more of an impact (although still giving a very good/noticeable impact in raids) as well by greatly reducing unslowed mob dps, not to mention its pulling benefit in raids.<br />
<br />
The Stonewall AA isn't something we need, any good SK puller can easily work around it, and even if they can't we need a new FD spell anyways so why not push to have that AA incorporated into the spell?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm aware - it doesn't change anything.  I referred to them as 10sec stuns because that's how they're labled on lucy and it's a distinguishing feature.  <br />
<br />
Recourses that effect the group should goto the short duration buff box (Aura of Hate/Darkness for us), you could make the argument that we shouldn't be sacrificing yet another buff slot on AoP but if the extra buff slot aa rumor is true for OoW then that argument won't carry much weight. <br />
<br />
As you've said yourself, there's a limit to how many things you can put in the short buff box; there's due cause for a dedicated recourse box unless the increase in buff slots is fairly dramatic, which I can't imagine it will be.  <br />
<br />
An accuracy debuff has a variable effect, while it's true that mitigation does as well my suggestion is instant, has the benefit of not being a spell (thus no spell gem), also an aggro fix should be done with our existing spells not by giving us additional spells. <br />
<br />
I'm not sure where you're going with this other than pointing out the obvious.  <br />
<br />
Stuns, mitigation discs, accuracy debuffs, etc. all have variable/scalable effects.  That's why they're powerful.  <br />
<br />
The accuracy debuff would be an equivilant to pally stuns, which are spells and are not instant - it's logical that our equivilant is equal in this (note that both cast and recast times are the same).  The debuff is not intended as a pulling fix.  <br />
<br />
I'm not proposing this as an aggro fix - I want to see terrors fixed to scale properly; this would help, however, that's a a side-effect.  The aggro is needed for reasons already discussed.  <br />
<br />
I can understand wanting an invul melee ability, and hell even with my suggestions it could still be warranted possibly (but making it shield only is gay) <br />
<br />
Invlun disc is certainly warrented - knights are the only melee's without one, and we have more use for it than most of them.  As for shield-only being &quot;gay&quot; - so is the dmg reduction on defensive and the snare on stonewall.  I can sorta see arguments against the shield req on the invlun disc and am not entirely decided on that, but you'll have a hell of a time convincing me otherwise on the mitigation disc.<br />
<br />
Your mitigation disc would give an enhancement to offtanking only and be of less usefulness while pulling than my disc. While yours would be of higher usefulness in raids on trash mobs thats not where a Paladins stun advantage is at its highest, that advantage is in exp groups which is where mine would be providing more of an impact (although still giving a very good/noticeable impact in raids) as well by greatly reducing unslowed mob dps, not to mention its pulling benefit in raids. <br />
<br />
It's providing less impact in exp groups is 100% intentional.  Pally stuns would be of less value and we'd have the accuracy debuff for that.  Any more than that and you end up putting warriors out of the job - you don't to do that any more than I do.  <br />
<br />
It's not intended as a pulling fix either.  The invlun disc would have uses for pulling without a doubt, but I think an upgrade to deathpeace is more in order than a pulling disc, as a pulling disc cannot be created to not impact tanking.  I'm open to suggestions on that matter. <br />
<br />
The mitigation disc is aimed at raid offtanking - it is the tool we need to excell at our role.  <br />
<br />
The Stonewall AA isn't something we need, any good SK puller can easily work around it, and even if they can't we need a new FD spell anyways so why not push to have that AA incorporated into the spell? <br />
<br />
I added it because it's something many, many SK's have asked for and I couldn't come up with a reason it'd be unbalanced, especially with the monk community's majority stance that their primary role is DPS, not pulling.  As for the new spell... see above - havn't included anything yet because I'm undecided on what to do with it.  Silviir had promised us some pulling suggestions, but hasn't delivered yet.  :mad:  :mad:  :mad: *shakes fist*  I was waiting for her response to do anything on that matter.</div></div><hr />

  I appreciate your comments, and effort you are making here - however,<br />
I'll have to continue to disagree with a few of your points. <br />
<br />
&gt;Other tanking discs have some sort of penalty - requiring a shield for our <br />
&gt;tanking disc is logical. Warriors are forced to carry multiple weapon setups, <br />

&gt;competing with scaling abilities using the same non-scaling abilities the low-<br />
&gt;enders are. <br />
<br />
<br />
  I don't see the logic in requiring a certain weapon configuration to use<br />
a discipline.   No other discipline works that way, not even the warrior /shield<br />
ability requires a shield.    Making this discipline work this way seems short<br />
sighted in the sense that although at the moment 1handers and shields are<br />
the best setup for tanking, in the future this may not continue to work this<br />
way.   If our epic 2.0 is another 2 hander, are we going to stuck swapping<br />
it out to use disciplines?   I'd rather not tie the weapons types we fight<br />
with to any restrictions on disciplines - there hasn't been any reason for<br />
any other class to have this penalty, can we avoid digging ourselves into<br />
that particluar hole?<br />
<br />
&gt;Regarding giving it a 3min duration/10min reuse, that's exactly the wrong <br />

anything that can be used that fast.  From my own experience as a warrior,<br />
I would have loved something like that.   They are either going to whine<br />
loud enough that they *also* get it (in which case what's class defining about<br />
it for us?) -or- they'll get it nerfed to 10 mins reuse - in which case I'd have<br />
wanted the longer duration of 3 minutes.<br />
<br />
&gt; From another thread about mana vs endurance bar:<br />
&gt;That's about the worst justification for that decision possible. Endurance is <br />
&gt;to pure melee's as mana is to knights. They have endurance on their gear, <br />
&gt;we have mana on ours; they have endurance regen AA's, we have mana <br />
&gt;regen. Making it &quot;in line&quot; with pure melees' discs would probably mean to <br />
&gt;make it mana based.<br />
<br />
  Not quite.  Endurance has a pretty slow recharge rate and is pain to build<br />
back up during combat.   It's very difficult for warriors to chain incite and<br />
run defensive and have much left over for anything else, and there is no<br />
good way to recharge endurance other than not using the ability.   Mana<br />
is way too easy to recharge and manipulate with buffs, mod rods, hell even<br />
mana pumping.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
  It seems to me your trying to sell something unique, that has some<br />
disadvantages to offset some hidden advantages - namely to build a unique<br />
role for our class.   Although that seems to me to be a noble cause, I thought<br />
we already had a role for our class as a sometimes raid off tank and good<br />
utility / group tank.    The game mechanics and Sony's inability to deal with<br />
the impact of defensive on classes after this many expansions is the key<br />
problem.<br />
<br />
  I'd rather say to Sony, here - you screwed up by not thinking about the<br />
impact of defensive as the game has grown.   The knight class tanks<br />
have been squeezed out of there role - by the sheer mathematics of the<br />
way the game works now.   Please deal with the problem by giving those<br />
classes a scaled back version of defensive.   This discipline will have no<br />
advantages other than providing a bridge between full defensive and <br />
non defensive melee types.  You can make it work like other disciplines so it's <br />
easy to code and implement, etc.<br />
<br />
  I think this approach would be an easier sell, as it's easy to implement and<br />
straight foward approach to the general problem.   The risk we run by making<br />
it complicated is not getting what we asked for, and having to thrash with<br />
Sony to get it right.<br />

Because of the way it may end up being used, I can understand not limiting the invuln disc - the idea there, however, is that we already have readily available &quot;oh shit&quot; tools.  While other classes' invuln discs can be used to get them out of an overaggro or similar jam, knigts have harmshield/DA for that already.  That said, I've already said I'm still debating it regarding the invuln disc.  For the mitigation disc, it is a fair restriction - it would mirror the damage reduction on defensive to an extent, and bear in mind that warriors are essentially required to carry multiple weapon configurations; nothing wrong with being in the same boat.  <br />

We don't need to be gimped warriors.  You give us a watered down defensive with the same duration/reuse and we're still inferior tanks with the oh so cherished &quot;utility&quot; at the high end.  We need something tailored to OUR role, not to warriors role.  3mins/10mins is for tanking big mobs; 72secs/4.5mins is perfect for tanking trash mobs.  We don't want to be competing with warriors for raid MT spots, we want the tools needed to excell at our role of offtanking.  With your suggestion, we're not excelling, we're just a little close to warriors.  <br />

<br />
From talking to warriors, there'll be less oposition to something that does not put us into competition (real or perceived) for their raid role than something that returns us to our role, but there'll be heavy warrior opposition to ANY knight tanking upgrades - they want us to have more utility and DPS and think that'll fix everything.  Warriors don't have or need anything that &quot;can be used that fast&quot; because offtanking is not their (your?) role; for us to have a role, we have to do something better than them (you?).  <br />

Warrior defensive is actually better in XP groups - you're not going to pull a mob every 4.5 minutes any more than you're going to pull a mob every 10 minutes - it's the total active time that counts, and warriors have a slight advantage in that, not to mention their innate advantage and the fact that their disc would mitigate more.  <br />
<br />
Oh, and wanting a weaker ability because someone might bitch and SOE might nerf it?  Yeah, that's a great way to achieve balance.  <br />
<br />
  Not quite. Endurance has a pretty slow recharge rate and is pain to build<br />
back up during combat. It's very difficult for warriors to chain incite and<br />
run defensive and have much left over for anything else, and there is no<br />
good way to recharge endurance other than not using the ability. Mana<br />
is way too easy to recharge and manipulate with buffs, mod rods, hell even<br />
mana pumping.<br />
 <br />
<br />
Pretty sure I covered this in detail already.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Klang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">For the mitigation disc, it is a fair restriction - it would mirror the damage reduction on defensive to an extent, and bear in mind that warriors are essentially required to carry multiple weapon configurations; nothing wrong with being in the same boat.  <br />
<br />
  Sure, warriors carry around multiple weapon configurations, some of which<br />
are used to achieve the utility we have with spells.   But there is nothing<br />
that requires them to use certain configurations to use disciplines.  In fact,<br />
I can think of no other class that would have a similar restriction.   I still<br />
don't buy your reasoning here.   I really think complicating this issue is not<br />
in our best interest for the following reasons:<br />
<br />
  1) Reduces our flexibility to use what would be our (potentially) best<br />
      discipline.  We have no idea what 2handers or other things may be<br />
      in future expansions.<br />
<br />
  2) Adds effort to get SOE to get it coded right (nothing else works like this)<br />
<br />
  3) Having this restriction isn't required to get SOE to do something here.  <br />
<br />
  I can agree with you that shields SHOULD have some impact on mitigation<br />
and evasion etc, but so far SOE has declined to do anything about it.   For<br />
good or bad, shields just aren't that big a deal.   I'd rather help you argue<br />
a case for making shields actually do *something* meaningful, rather than<br />
wire it in to this discipline.<br />
<br />
We don't need to be gimped warriors.  You give us a watered down defensive with the same duration/reuse and we're still inferior tanks with the oh so cherished &quot;utility&quot; at the high end.  We need something tailored to OUR role, not to warriors role.  3mins/10mins is for tanking big mobs; 72secs/4.5mins is perfect for tanking trash mobs.  We don't want to be competing with warriors for raid MT spots, we want the tools needed to excell at our role of offtanking.  With your suggestion, we're not excelling, we're just a little close to warriors.  <br />
<br />
We don't want to just &quot;get a little closer&quot; to warriors - warriors and knights have different niches on raids.  Warriors have the tools to excell in theirs, but we do not have the tools to excell in ours.  <br />
<br />
From talking to warriors, there'll be less oposition to something that does not put us into competition (real or perceived) for their raid role than something that returns us to our role, but there'll be heavy warrior opposition to ANY knight tanking upgrades - they want us to have more utility and DPS and think that'll fix everything.  Warriors don't have or need anything that &quot;can be used that fast&quot; because offtanking is not their (your?) role; for us to have a role, we have to do something better than them (you?).  <br />
<br />
Warrior defensive is actually better in XP groups - you're not going to pull a mob every 4.5 minutes any more than you're going to pull a mob every 10 minutes - it's the total active time that counts, and warriors have a slight advantage in that, not to mention their innate advantage and the fact that their disc would mitigate more.  <br />
<br />
Oh, and wanting a weaker ability because someone might bitch and SOE might nerf it?  Yeah, that's a great way to achieve balance.  <br />
 <br />
 <br />
   Ok, before we go any further - I played a SK long before I played a warrior,<br />
and I've come back.   I've always had a deeper love for playing a SK than<br />
my warrior, mostly for the utility I get when not involved with raiding.   I have<br />
always been supportive of some kind of SK discipline, even when I played a<br />
warrior - and that has never changed.   I really wish people would stop being<br />
so selfish as to think that the game is better if all the other classes (except<br />
the ones they are playing) are gimped - but that's a whole other discussion.<br />
<br />
   I think you have a misconception on the way defensive gets used by a<br />
warrior, and how we'll use it.   For XP groups, it's one of 2 options a warrior<br />
has for survival on pre-slowing a mob (defensive/fortitude).   If a warrior<br />
starts getting hammered hard (gotta love that RNG), you can pop one of the<br />
2 and buy some time for a CH to land.   Or if you are fighting a semi named,<br />
you can pop defensive until the mob is slowed and turn it off to conserve<br />
endurance - total time is not the key factor in these situations.<br />
<br />
   As for the discipline you propose, if you could get it along the timing<br />
parameters you listed (72/4.5), then more power to you.   I'm just trying<br />
to explain it's not something a warrior gets, nor is he going to be happy<br />
about it.   Would I like it for us, a SK?  You damn betcha.   I just think<br />
that giving us something &quot;special&quot; is a tougher sell, that's all.<br />
<br />
  Anyways, I just wanted to be clear on those 2 points.    I dislike having<br />
any weapon setup tied to this discipline - but the timing parameters are more<br />
than fine - just what you have outlined is going to be harder to get SOE<br />
to do than a watered down disc.<br />
<br />

So you're saying you expect/accept knights being the red-headed step children of warriors, unable to have unique abilities that might actually challenge warrior dominance.  Good call.  <br />
<br />
 1) Reduces our flexibility to use what would be our (potentially) best<br />
discipline. We have no idea what 2handers or other things may be<br />
in future expansions. <br />
<br />
That's the whole point - to reduce its flexibility.  <br />
<br />
As for future weapons, they need to keep both types balanced for their uses - 2h should remain better DPS 1h should remain better defensively.  If they deviate from that, that's an itemization issue that would have to be addressed.  Regarding epic 2.0 (assuming it remains a 2h), they could code it to qualify as a shield, just as epic 1.0 was for bashing.<br />
<br />
 2) Adds effort to get SOE to get it coded right (nothing else works like this) <br />
<br />
It wouldn't be hard to code - they should be able to put in the little bit of extra effort to get something right.  <br />
<br />
 3) Having this restriction isn't required to get SOE to do something here.  <br />
<br />
You're in no position to make such an assertation, but so what if it isn't?  I'm not looking to simply improve my class - I'm looking for a way to the tank classes to be brought in line with eachother.  Whether or not you consider it a balance factor is another issue, but at this point nothing anyone has said has done anything to suggest to me that such a restriction is out of place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Synapticus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Might sound stupid, but if Knights get a defensive, warriors are going to need a lot more to justify their existence; they themselves will need more utility and usefulness especially in a small raid or single group encounter (not so much a raid environment)</div></div><hr />

There is no in-game justification for such a restriction, and the same effect could be achieved by simply making the damage reduction modifier on the discipline much worse than it is for warriors.

I raid time once a week, and the best sheilds and 1 handers ill get are dkp drops, as are the 2 handers.  so ill in turn be forced to buy 3 items with my points where a warrior only needs to buy 2 items in time.  virtually putting me further behind them on future upgrade by almost 100 points... not that i really get anything the very first time it drops anyway, or care that i do,  but thats the only real problem i have with it... i think the fuctionality of it as a whole sounds good to me.<br />
<br />
edit: when i mention warriors only need to buy 2 items, thats bypassing any other potential upgrades in the zone and focusing on the prim/sec slots only..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Pyrthin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">This isn't going to reduce flexibility, it's just going to funnel all knights into using 1h all the time.  No knight is going to risk not being ready to use this discipline by wielding a 2h for a minimal difference in DPS.  In an &quot;oh shit&quot; situation, you will not have enough time to switch your weapons out and hit the discipline before you are already dead.  The 2h weapons will only come out when the content is trivial and knights want to feel good about doing a few extra points of melee damage.<br />
<br />
You've emphasized yourself that as tanks first and foremost, our DPS is far less of a concern than our survival.  How often do you really see yourself pulling out the 2h on raids when there's any chance you might need to use this discipline?  Certainly not when you might need to offtank.  Maybe on long, single mob boss fights?  Even in that case, the minimal additional DPS you could contribute is negligible when weighed against the potential of the MT dying and you being able to step up and keep the fight going that much longer because you were ready to hit your discipline.<br />
<br />
All this would really accomplish is lowering our already suffering DPS all the time, not only when we're using our discipline.  Warriors in GoD are already outdamaging knights in addition to outtanking them.  Our DPS should be increased, not reduced even further.  Not every knight is going to be able to get epic 1.5, much less 2.0, and those that don't will be left even further behind if epics are the only &quot;shield enabled&quot; 2hers.<br />
<br />
Assuming the devs are even open to the idea of some kind of discipline like this for us, I'm pretty certain whether it is &quot;balanced&quot; by requiring us to use a shield or by making the damage reduction much larger than the warrior version isn't going to make much difference.  The key is proving to them that such a discipline is needed in the first place, rather than applying an unnecessary restriction to make it palatable.  Getting them to even acknowledge the major balance issue this addresses will be a major victory in itself, and will not be won this way.</div></div><hr />

  I haven't looked at their code, but my guess would be it's not going to be trivial because no disciplines require any sort of equipment checks.   (20 years programming large projects might give me a clue here, but who knows I can be wrong)<br />

<br />
It would in no way prevent knights from using 2h altogether.  For the most part, you know when you're going to have to offtank something.  When you know you're going to be tanking, you're generally using 1h/shield anyway.  When you're not going to be tanking or pulling, you'll still use a 2h over a 1h.  Having to offtank a surprise mob constitutes an &quot;oh shit&quot; situation; those sorts of situation warrent an invuln disc, which I've already observed may be better off without the shield req.  If you're going to follow that with mitigation disc, you've got 18 secs - ample time to switch weapons.  <br />
<br />
Oh, and note that never once have I mentioned a damage penalty.  <br />
<br />
Sure I can. I assert SOE HAS to do something. The mere mathematics of these encounters IS broken for us. What's wrong with me trying to suggest that you adjust your proposal?

<br />
They don't have to do anything they don't want to do.  They can go about trying to mask the issue with content changes or hell, it's their game, they can do nothing at all.  Regardless, my inclusion of the shield requirement had nothing to do with making it more palpable to SOE or anything.  It's a logical restriction, with a number of beneficial side effects.  The only arguments being raised against it are that it would be inconvenient or cumbersom or whatnot and I don't see that as being so unfair; it's inconvenient and cumbersom for a warrior to have to switch weapons to not overaggro when not tanking or what-not.  Most knights at the high-end already use a shield in the applicable situations; the ones at the low end need it less because of non-scaling universally available spells, thus the poorer 1h/shield itemizatoin at that level of play is a valid counter to this.  <br />
<br />
Come up with a valid argument against it - something more than the &quot;inconvenience&quot; of having to have both weapon sets - and I'll reconsider, but I see nothing to warrent it at this point, and it's not like its me against the masses on this either; alot of others have agreed on the matter.  Someone came up with a logical reason to remove the requirement on the immunity disc, and I agreed, but inconvenience doesn't constitute ample justification in my mind.  <br />
<br />
BTW, I don't take anything personally, and for the record, requiring a shield wasn't even my idea originally.</div></div><hr />

The same could be asked the other way around. Come up with a valid arguement for the restriction. Ive read all the threads and not seen anything that makes me believe that restriction is a good thing and seen plenty of half arguements for no restiction<br />

I think that's the problem.<br />
Warriors will actually gain ground in XP groups with this change - pallys are currently very overpowered on blue XP mobs; this will take the edge off of that  <br />
Yes, its true that reducing power of pally stuns will increase relative power of warriors and SKs, but since when did nerfing one class actually make another class better or desirable?  Did nerfing Cleric's complete heal make Druids and SHamans a better healer?  Maybe i dont have enough experience in this game, but please give me an example where this is so.<br />
I am not a hardcore raider but rather a casual 4-5 hour a week player, so this is the aspect that i care more about.  In an XP group, aggro is the #1 commodity.  Reducing power of stun does jack shit for warrior aggro in an XP group.  These changes only benefit knights in a GoD type single group or raid environment, and this would really make Warriors much less desirable in more than one aspect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">If the people you're competing with for a job get worse (less overpowered) at something, that makes you more desirable.

Pallys wouldn't be getting nerfed overall, though.  Their power would be more evenly distributed across content, as they would be less reliant upon one ability which is not evenely applicable.  This is a good thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Pretecf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">I find this discussion informative and extremely interesting.<br />
<br />
I must be added to the list that does not want a discipline linked to a shield requirement.  Foremost for me is the argument that I would always have to be a 1H plus shield knight.  Why?  Well, it is simple for me.  The 'oh shit' can happen at any time.  A poorly placed LD or two dynamically changes a situation.  My current role in a group or a raid is to handle the unexpected, in our minds, the definition of utility.  My personal belief is that using the 2H in this situation is like the druid who does not use one of their spell slots for an evac because they did not expect it to be necessary.  Then, of course, it is too late when necessary happens.<br />
<br />
I understand the purpose behind 72/4.5, but would it be an easier sell at 72/5?  Is there that large of a benefit in the other half minute?  We, as a group, do need warriors on our side.  Why not make the math obvious?</div></div><hr />

<br />
A couple of the coments saying how this would be less than ideal for 'all' SKs cought my attention. My first SK only made it to 55 befor I decided that I was tired of getting stunned so much and remade an ogre, so I was, and am far away from seeing any of the &quot;good&quot; 1-hander/shield combo's.<br />
<br />
That being said, I have to agree with SJ on the shield requirement. Even while in an EXP group, and especially at lower levels your DPS is (or should be) insignifigant to that of your group. I have lost track of the number of times I was called to join a group of friends while in PoK and forgot to remove my stiens. The mobs did not die noticably slower, people were not running oom after each fight. As I have my hits tucked away off to the side as my hit/miss rate gets depressing, I would usually only notice if I realized that my proc's were not going off at all, or if I was having to cast my agro spells more than usual. (or my friends started laughing at me)<br />
<br />
So far all of the mitigation disciplines that are in game do have a drawback of some sort, tieing ours to a shield is relatively minor to those already in existance, and near nonexistant as compared to some that have been sugested in the past - agro reducer, mana drain/silence, spell based etc.<br />
<br />
As far as mana or endurance based, I would prefer endurance.<br />
a) because mana replenishment is far superior to endurance, it would give knight more staying power over warriors even if their active time is better than ours - think necro vs wiz dps over a long fight.<br />
b) for an off tanking position we need our mana to get and maintain agro and/or to aid our survivability during the fight. As good as top-end mana regen may be, would our mana be able to hold up under those conditions and the disc running? For someone at my level, definatly not, but I do not have any experience at the high end.<br />
If these discs do go live, I do not see why +end could not be added to SK/PAL only gear the same way it was added to the plate/all when it was introduced.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for the shield, in &quot;oh shit&quot; situations, you'd be using the invuln disc, but fuck it - I'll just put a damage reduction on the mitigation disc... it's probably slightly worse for us in the end, but it's not going to have much impact either way &amp; I'm tired of arguing about it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because the pure melee's would have another monumental bitchfest (like the one that went on for years) about how we benefit more from armor than they do - we get to use the HP, the mana, and the endurance - they can't use mana!!!<br />
<br />
Now of course, this is fundamentally flawed IMO because yes, we can use the mana and the HP and the enduracne, but we use them less effectively than the &quot;pure&quot; classes.  We don't get the same effectiveness out of our mana that a wizzy or a necro does, etc.  I'm not saying we shouldn't ask for the best solution because of other classes' bitching, but be warned that that would be a likely result - it was a multi-year bitchfest before endurance was added.  <br />
<br />
a) because mana replenishment is far superior to endurance, it would give knight more staying power over warriors even if their active time is better than ours - think necro vs wiz dps over a long fight. <br />
<br />
I'm aware, and whether or not this is an argument for mana or for endurance is what I need to determine.  It is arguably a benefit that it would give our disc more staying power - that's the point of offtanking, but it would have the *theoretical* unneeded advantage in XP groups of making ours sustainable longer.  Now, everyone with a brain knows that neither our disc or warriors' is going to be chained in XP groups, so it shoudln't really be a factor, but theoretical possibilities always need to be accounted for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Xanathol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">First off, I do NOT believe we need warriors on our side; changes in this game have been made in the past with total disrespect to the opinions of other classes involved...and it should be that way.

Also, we will never get the majority of warriors to back a push for us that is in any way meaningful, by virtue of the countless threads on the matter.<br />
<br />
My opinion on the shield bit? It's a pointless point. If anything like the proposed discipline was granted to us, whether it requires a shield or not will not determine if we get it, or if it will help us. What I am saying is, is that SoE won't base their decision on the matter, and if we get a disc at all, on this requirement or not, and if we do get it, we'll be viable and far better off than we are now. Therefore, its a point not worth mentioning in such a proposal, since it only adds more words to skip when reading the post to get to the juicy parts. Reposting and reposting of novels are not going to get us fixed - clear, to the point post on the matter *that devs actually read and act upon* will get us fixed. Seeing a novel doesn't make someone say &quot;oh, that must be important!&quot; but rather tends to make one decide they do not have time to read it.</div></div><hr />

Regardless, my inclusion of the shield requirement had nothing to do with making it more palpable to SOE or anything.  It's a logical restriction, with a number of beneficial side effects.  The only arguments being raised against it are that it would be inconvenient or cumbersom or whatnot and I don't see that as being so unfair; it's inconvenient and cumbersom for a warrior to have to switch weapons to not overaggro when not tanking or what-not.  Most knights at the high-end already use a shield in the applicable situations; the ones at the low end need it less because of non-scaling universally available spells, thus the poorer 1h/shield itemizatoin at that level of play is a valid counter to this.  <br />
<br />
Come up with a valid argument against it - something more than the &quot;inconvenience&quot; of having to have both weapon sets - and I'll reconsider, but I see nothing to warrent it at this point, and it's not like its me against the masses on this either; alot of others have agreed on the matter.  Someone came up with a logical reason to remove the requirement on the immunity disc, and I agreed, but inconvenience doesn't constitute ample justification in my mind.  <br />
<br />
   Ok, if the only reason to have shields required for these disciplines is for &quot;a logical restriction&quot;, then I submit you are arguing for an aesthetic reason and not a logical one.   Shields have never provided extra defense, mitigation, blocking other than the amount of ac/hp extra they provided versus your 2 handed weapon setup.   Sure, it would make sense for shields to do something extra, but even upon constant pestering SOE has not done anything significant to shields via an extra block ability.   I can see why people would aesthetically want shields to do something &quot;extra&quot;, but wiring them to our discipline is the wrong approach.   The desire to use to shield should be a geniuine one based on some serious mitigation benefits, not because we wanted to invent an aesthetic reason by tying them to our disciplines. <br />
<br />
   As to the reasons I've elaborated for not doing this, here's my list:<br />
<br />
1)  The SK class is already restricted to 2 handed and 1 hand/ shield combinations.   We are talking about the addition of huge major disciplines to our class, yet this suggestion would restrict our limited fight styles further into one fight style.   We are already restricted enough, further restrictions are NOT needed.<br />
<br />
2)  1 handed / shield fight styles are currently popular on the upper end, yet there was a time not long ago when those weapons were completely shunned and hated by the community.   I can remember those posts vividly when any number of prominent SKs would say how they shunned their one handers for 2 handers.   While it might fit in *currently* with the way people play the class, it might not continue to do so!   If Epic 1.5 and 2.0 are going to be implemented as 2-handers again, we are going to hate ourselves for asking for this restriction!<br />
<br />
3)  Sure, warriors carry multiple weapons, and use many of them for various tanking situations and for utility effects.   I've never suggested that we not also do the same, and I myself keep a bag full of weapons / shields for various reasons.   However, no class has a restriction on a particular weapon setup and using a discipline.   There should never be a suprise factor of not being about to use a discipline, because a particular weapon setup wasn't equipped.<br />
<br />
4)  Ease of implementation.   Having a flat 30 percent mitigation discipline 72 sec duration / 4.5 re-use that ran off the endurance bar with no other restrictions is easy for them to implement.   It works like all the disciplines, copy something from the warrior templates, change some numbers, add the books into game - bang all done.    Having to code &quot;special&quot; stuff like running off the mana bar and having certain weapons equipped isn't trivial, and it's also not risk free.    Wouldn't everyone here like to have this discipline sooner than later?   I'd rather have this sitting at the top of some engineer's easy-to-do-why-haven't-I done-this-yesterday's list than his medium-risk-I'll-do-this-after-the-easy-stuff list.<br />
<br />
   In summary, I think it's short-sighted to make this kind of restriction for aesthetic reasons.   Using a shield should be important on it's own merits not because we tied it to our discipline.   Furthermore, it complicates getting this done immediately.  I really believe the longer this hangs over us, the worse our class reputation becomes - and the more likely we suffer more people quitting.  <br />

As for &quot;making it easy so we get it fast&quot; - fuck that.  I'd rather have something that's done right.  &quot;If something's worth doing, it's worth doing right.&quot; -proverb<br />
<br />
Coding it to run off mana wouldn't be any more difficult than coding it to run off endurance by my understanding - discs and spells use the same engine, it would simply be a matter of changing one value or line of code or whatever.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Tornicade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">Why not an absorption reflection disc thats directly proportional to what your fighting. Or any discpline thats involes a  drain of some sort which would be more suited to the Sk Class. Taking away from a mob and using it against him is what this class is all about so why not incorporate that in a new discipline. if a sk is getting hot for 2k and uses the absorption disc  a ercentage of it would get  shot back. probably wouldnt even have to do anything about aggro which seems would be built in<br />
This would make it a defensive disc and leave it to up to the sk to  aggro the first hit</div></div><hr />
