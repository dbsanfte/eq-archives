<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nekrosis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After trying many types of SKs (Iksar, Human, Ogre, Troll, etc.) I have decided to go with Dark Elf.  I just wanted comments from other Dark Elves out there on how effective a SK they are in combat.  Can you hold your own in battle?  Have you ever been the MT on raids?  Do you have problems with low STR and STA in the late game?  Thx for all the comments I receive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Paradox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I totally love my DE SK.  I haven't been MT on raids because my guild has a few Warriors that are much higher level than I am.  In groups I am mainly puller.  I'll pull and dump aggro on to the MT, then go pull another with some taking as needed.  I can be MT in single groups, but I don't like it.  I'd rather be doing something more involved.<br />
<br />
I can solo quite well.  Pets help with this even though they seem second rate at times.  Think of them as an extra DoT.  Some may say that larger races are better at soloing because of more HP and regen, others say that having more mana for fear and spells are better.  It all depends on you're type of game play style.  Later on, the stats can be all balanced out with gear, so in the long run, it may not matter - again, you're game play style.<br />
<br />
A group of my guildmates went to SkyFire the other day killing wyverns, mature wurms, soul defilers, etc.  Most of the people who went were casters or casters with pets.  There was one other melee with me and after the pull came in, it came down to me calling the shots on actually battling the mobs (basically fearkiting, knowing the pathing and taking as needed to keep aggro off the nukers.  Knowing when fear would break, when to tell casters to back pets off and standing toe to toe with the mobs were my main duties.)<br />
<br />
I split my starting points into STR and STA bringing them up to 80 each from 70.  As a DE SK, CHA and WIS mean nothing.  INT level is fine where at 109 starting.  I didn't think DEX was needed at first, but I have found that items with a plus to DEX are easier to come by than STA - at least ones you would want anyway.<br />
<br />
I am in no-way uber and I there is a lot more I have to learn, but I hope this little bit I could share helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Azieru Xionhart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">....bAH DE SK, if you want a more well balance stat SK char, it'd be Iksars :D Plus it add a challenge too like being KOS everwhere xcept Cabilis, Thrug, some Luclin towns but hey SK's suppose to be KOS. So DE looks nice but Iksar's are the true image of evil plus Trolls too. And DE SK's are too common these days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Pheargore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">One of the most Ubber Warriors in a Top 3 Guild on TM is a Wood Elf...<br />
<br />
BAH! makes me sick, but it's true...<br />
<br />
- Peace</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Azieru Xionhart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">WTF an wood elf u say? dang, he must really be uber or the others just suck ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>psicore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think the DE race is a good one to chose. You can get strength from alot of different types of armor. The troll regen is something hard to beat, but with the new AA levels and a chestplate with regen its not that much of a difference. IVe played a DE since january of 2000. For the most part id say they are fun to pk ppl with. I also hated the fact that i had to duck with a troll in soem places. thats my 2 cp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Manslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Race is more or less irrelevant in the endgame.  Most profiles end up looking very similar.  I have no issues tanking XP stuff or offtanking mobs on raids.  Warriors get to tank the big stuff.<br />
<br />
With VoG, Focus, Talisman of the Brute, Avatar, and C3, you need 88str, 70dex, 115agi, 205sta, and 230int to get them all to 255 with these buffs.  Of course this requires you to have primal, which isn't something you will get for some time as a new character so discounting Avatar add 100 to str, dex, and agi.  As a dark elf even I would gladly trade a ton of physical stats atm for 20int, since that seems to me to be the hardest stat to max while keeping my hps as high as possible.<br />
<br />
And none of this really applies to the getting to 60 part, just the once you get to a raiding environment, though honestly getting to 60 is alot easier in general now than it used to be due to more zones to xp in, easier to get better gear etc.</div></div><hr />
