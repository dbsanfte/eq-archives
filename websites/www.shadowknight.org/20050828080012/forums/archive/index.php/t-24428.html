<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mikazu</div><div class="date">03-11-2005, 04:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I'm back in EQ1 after half a year off. I stopped play just after OoW came out, but for whatever reason, WoW and EQ2 didn't hold my interest for very long. If I keep playing EQ1 (and I might just cancel and go mmog free for a while), it would be very low key. Like 1 or 2 hours a night, 2 or 3 times a week.<br />
<br />
Anyhoo, I currently have my girlfriends level 58 shadowknight (5500 hp / 1500 AC buffed with Virtue), and my level 58 shaman. XP is already chopped on them because of the whole iksar/troll race thing, so I guess I'm looking for a decent place to duo them with noticable xp gain every session.<br />
<br />
When I left last year, I had parked them in Grieg's End. It was a hot zone at the time, and the xp was just huge there. Giving it a try last night, the xp was ... not so good. 4 or so kills per % xp for each character. And the kills themselves took a long time. (maybe 2 minutes per kill?) Using a knight's mace means lesser dps then the OoW sword thingie that procs stun (it's currently a 38/30 weapon at level 58), but the healing proc (180 point heal) means I finish every fight at 90% or more HP with my shaman near full mana as well, after tossing on a malo, slow, and 2 dots. So I can kill literally non stop, with only the sloooooow assed kill rate limiting me.<br />
<br />
The point of this drawn out post is to ask if there is a particular place where a 58 sk/shaman combo could churn out a high rate of xp per hour. Because I'll only be playing for 60 or 90 minutes at a time, and relatively infrequently, the boredom factor hopefully won't play much of a factor. :)<br />
<br />
So any suggestions? How is the new expansion for upper 50 level characters? Again, I'm hoping to get good xp per hour as opposed to xp per fight. So if I can kill 10 things in 10 minutes with 0 downtime and make only .5% per kill, I'd take it over 1 kill that takes 10 minutes and gives me 4% for the kill. Obviously everybody's mmv, but any advice would be greatly appreciated.<br />

<br />
Dulak boats are surprisingly good exp (fairly quick kills)  and DoN is very good as well if you get it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oagan</div><div class="date">03-14-2005, 11:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First or second boat in Dulak would be good, as would be the cave.  Lot of gem drops there.  Names will pop on the boats as well, but drops from them are so so.  You could probably give Droga a try, too.  First few named areas wouldn't be too tough.  You'd be fighting up to even con mobs that hit for the 150's.  Just watch out for the roamers in Droga.  If one of them gets loose, they bring friends.  Bind your shaman just outside, so he can gate if that occurs.  You can flop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mikazu</div><div class="date">03-14-2005, 12:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I gave it a couple hours over the weekend, and sadly I think the best place I've found for convenience (short run - able to sit the shaman on a lizard - single pulls) is PoN. It's easy as sin and completely risk free. I've done some parsing though, and I'm starting to realize the pain that is the shadowknight ... namely - low dps.<br />
<br />
Just in regular grind mode (ie. not over nuking, keeping my mana at a steady level, continual pulls) I parse at about 45 to 50 dps with a Knight's Mace (which also isn't the best damage weapon, but the proc is spectacular). Hell, the shaman outdps' the sk between a BoN - EBolt - alpha dog.<br />
<br />
But I guess that's the tradeoff - excellent tankability, decent aggro generation (although the shaman can still steal it if I get lazy), and some nice utility. Just low damage. C'est la vie.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DrayMay</div><div class="date">03-21-2005, 09:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A nice spot to duo the shaman and shadow knight would be in Draniks Scar at the Bloodfields zone line.  I spent a couple levels there with my SK Shaman duo.  Park the shaman on a mount at the bend in the tunnel and pull into the tunnel with the SK.  Lots of single pulls and go nonstop, if things go sour the zone is right behind you.  When things start to turn Lt Blue/Green you can move over to the Nobles Causeway zone line in Draniks Scar, mobs are a bit tougher and you will have to split some of them.<br />
<br />
All in all Draniks is a fun spot with a chance at the odd named spawn.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I actually tried that exact spot last week. :) I set up by the wall (not in the tunnel, because I figured that someone would bring a train at some point). It was incredibly safe, all the mobs were DB, and some named klv spawned in the middle of a hut there. I would pet pull without a problem, or just snare split when the pet got toasted by some lucky big hits.<br />
<br />
It seemed a decent enough spot, but not enough xp for me. ;) Damn iksar / troll xp penalty!!!<br />
<br />
Do you think I could straight on duo with the shaman / sk at level 58 in the bloodfields, or do the floating octopii hit too hard?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DrayMay</div><div class="date">03-23-2005, 07:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can give the Bloodfields a shot,  the spot I am using is just at the zone in.  There is a little alcove to the left of your zone in spot, directly across from the setup alcove is the zone out line to Draniks Scar.  I started here with with my SK at 61 and the shaman at 57.  You will need to split the mobs in the first room, 4 spawns come 2 at a time.  Once they are all dead start working through the various wings of the tunnel until the 1st room starts to repop.  Just be careful of the High Priest that can spawn in one of the side tunnels.  He can be a handful, mitigates slow, 500-600 hitter, 675 nukes, C heals, summons.<br />
<br />
The best I could get was about 3 kills = 1% reg exp for the shaman (Iksar).  The 50s are brutal for exp especially level 59 and unless you are in a solid exp group the best you can hope for is steady exp.  My SK is currently 63 and the shaman is 58 I see myself staying here for a bit, it is steady exp, a quiet zone, and ok coin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mikazu</div><div class="date">03-23-2005, 08:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the insight DrayMay. I haven't been playing much recently, but I think I'm going to spend some time tonight or tomorrow trying out some new areas for shits and giggles. I might try Chardok (drop down the bridge and pull to the safe room) even though I hate fighting casters. Plus my shaman is on Chardok faction, so it probably isn't the best idea on my part. :) Hmmmm, maybe I'll give Droga / Nurga a try again. Problem is I'm friggin' lazy, and like outdoor zones so I can plop the shaman on a lizard and not have to worry about medding.<br />
<br />
But yeah, can't wait to get out of the 50s. I'll probably just suck it up one day and play 3 hours and finish up 58. Don't have a lot of time to play these days, though, and when I do I tend to hop on to my cleric or enchanterand group play instead. Bleh, I guess when I'm finally in my 60s the pain will be worth it. Or something. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fallgore</div><div class="date">03-23-2005, 12:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe Velkators can be cool, can get $ at the same time while leveling.<br />
<br />
Also, you can try PoV, but I don't know how well duoing there; seen a 59 Necro solo there though.<br />
<br />
Umm,,,<br />
Drakin Scar is alright if takin on Murkgliders and stuff, try to hunt Nocs and try not to kill Dragorns; you want there  faction since there are sooo damn many of'em; you might want to just stick on their good list heh.<br />
<br />
- ALso makes it easier running through some nice zones...<br />
<br />
And maybe Dragon Necropolis Phase Spiders can be cool hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mikazu</div><div class="date">03-23-2005, 11:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tried a couple places tonight. Did the katta guards - I'd say 70% were still DB at level 58. Despite it being a 'hot zone', the xp there was sub par. Took many many many kills to get a single % on both characters. I ended up pulling the 4 summoning guards from the bank, and the xp for them was a bit better, I guess. Still nothing to write home about.<br />
<br />
Anyway, then I decided to try the Bloodfields. Pet pulled the first 4 mobs and took them down without much of a problem. As way of comparison, they seemed to have a bit more hp then trees in PoN, and they were more resistant. Might be a level thing though. XP was probably similar per kill.<br />
<br />
At that point I decided to head deeper into the zone. Saw The Heavy Burdened Golem up, which was red to me at 58. Cleared around him, then thought what the fuck. Loaded Gate on my shaman, pulled with Dooming, malo by shaman, got him slowed before engaging. Was a long ass fight, and a couple times I got the snot beat out of me before a heal could land. Ended with the shaman at 40% hp and the sk at 60% hp, but I beat him down. Looking at eqcompanion, I did 56 dps (13.5k total) over the course of the 4 minute, 3 second fight, Boney did 20.5 dps (5k total), and the shaman dog did 24 dps (5.7k). Shaman was mostly healing, but managed to land a few banes. The golem did 17k damage total to me (OUCH!) for 69.26 dps. Was hit for the max (544) three times, and the min (124) nineteen times.<br />
<br />
I imagine nobody really cares about the parse, but hey, I'm tired and this is my post, so there you have it. :)<br />
<br />
Still, it was pretty exciting to duo a red con, 544 point hitting mob, even if it was an OoW gimpy named.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mikazu</div><div class="date">03-24-2005, 04:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Had some time this morning, so I went to a couple new zones in my contining hunt for the perfect spot. :) To be honest, moving around to all these different zones / areas is quite enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Anyhoo, hit the Plane of Storms and took on the trash in the first area. Emboldened by my success against a red con mob in the Bloodfields, I figured &quot;How hard could even con mobs in PoP be?&quot; And you know what ... they were pretty damn easy. :) Even the casters weren't that tough, and with substandard resists (most between 110 - 130), I still resisted a fair amount. The fights themselves were fairly basic - get mob slowed, pet attack, beat it down, one or two heals later all done. But after 25 or 30 minutes, I moved on because of the incredibly funky aggro there. For some reason I had a frog grow a hard on for me - probably when I pulled a mob beside it but *outside* of its aggro range. So I got on its hate list, but didn't get aggro because it was too far away. So he wandered off adding me to the hate list of other mobs. I had just finished off a grizzly bear when I looked up and saw 4 mobs bearing down on me from nowhere. Feign failed (of course), and the SK got beat down while my shaman gated away. Bleh, annoying.<br />
<br />
After that I rezzed (one of the beauties of having a cleric on the shaman account :)) and decided to give PoN gobbies a try. Easy easy easy. Unfortunately the xp still wasn't amazing. I dinged 59, and after 3 kills of the gobs (well, 2 gobs and one big croc), I was still at 0%. *sigh*<br />
<br />
But this definitely opens up my options. I now know I can take on a level 58 mob (as long as its solo) without it being close or particularly dangerous. Figure now that the SK is 59, you can raise that by one level.<br />
<br />
So where's a good spot with a lot of high 50s mobs that's easy to get to, can be pulled and fought solo without adds? That's my next goal to find! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DrayMay</div><div class="date">03-24-2005, 05:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the updates Mikazu and congrats on the named in Bloodfields.  You have explored more options then I in the quest for a new spot, 59 is going to be one of the hardest levels to get through but things get a lot easier for a while after that.  I don't know how well it wold work but if you had eithe access to another 50plus account or even have someone join you for 5 minutes you could get a Draniks Scar expedition.  Once you get it, drop the 3rd and then go into it.  You have a low lag zone all to yourself.  Dont know how well it will work, but something to look into.</div></div><hr />
