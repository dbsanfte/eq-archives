<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimskayle</div><div class="date">06-19-2002, 07:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tonight I was in EC sellling, when I noticed 4-5 guards surrounding a building near FP zone line, they were green to me at 51 and I killed them easily. They all dropped nodrop bracers that were like &quot;soandso's bracer&quot;. They never spawned again, andinside the building they were surrounding was Pardor the Blessed. Tried hailing him, no avail, was only a merchant that suprisingly sold to a iksar like me. Anyone have any idea what these bracers are for????? No one seems to know</div></div><hr />

<br />
Each guard drops a bracer which bares his name which are surrendered as part of the final test for the fledgling gimps of North Freeport (Paladins) gives them a sword or something.<br />
