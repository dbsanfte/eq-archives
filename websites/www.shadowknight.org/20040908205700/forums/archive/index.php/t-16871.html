<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kelefane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I currently have a DE SK whos lvl 48....Didnt play with him for awhile.....Decided to start him back up recently and im wondering if a Bazaar equipped DE SK can be a good tank in PoP zones? BoT/PoV/HoH ect.....Im just kinda worried about his HP's....At level 48 he has 2k unbuffed....But he also has alot of equip where he wont get the full benefits of them until lvl 56ish...Wind-Worn BP/Windblade and some others of note......Do SK's in general get more HP per stamina then Rogues/Rangers? My main is a level 65 Rogue and was just curious about these things before I spend the time to lvl my SK....I basically wanna try and get 4k HP unbuffed with my DE SK....Any ideas? Thoughts on certain gear pieces? And a goal?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">the only thing youll be tanking is PoJ, DL and KC at 48 sry.  After a while no those items prolly wont have sufficent hp to tank outside of PoS, with some defensive aa you may be able to tank PoV but thats with aa of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kelefane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I was meaning later down the road (lvl 60+)....Not at level 48 where I am now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>greenbucket</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">you'll do fine I'm sure. So long, of course, as you have some. Saw a 65 pally tanking in BoT with a weighty polearm and 5ac bracers.<br />

Check my magelo.  W/ that gear and the aa's i spent i am at 4600ish self buffed at 65.  It took my getting PE/sta5/nd3 before I broke 4k unbuffed and that was at level 65.  It's a nice goal to shot for but as a DE it isnt all that easy.</div></div><hr />

what a load of crap.  you might be able to tank pov with that gear AND aa?  i have worse gear (stonewoodmail bp, 30ac 10str 50hps) and mostly noctivigant in the major slots.  no aa other than run3 regen3 and i can tank anything in pov.  your miles may vary i guess /shrug</div></div><hr />

Yea so basically the only thing making you a bad tank in those zones is your level. Level 60+ you should be good. I'm sure on your way you will find some upgrades as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Oberyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I very rarely raid, and when I do, its usually just to help a guilded friend out.  Gear is all Quest/bought/One groupable.  65 DE SK.<br />

Only HP AA I currently have is ND3.  3 levels mitigation AAs, Only one in avoidance atm.  Highly recommend the mitigation for PoP tanking.<br />
<br />
   Totally unbuffed Sitting over 4K now (4059 rings a bell?)  Don't neglect the AC side of the equation though either.  There's plenty of fine gear with a nice mix of AC and HPs available now, commonly.   <br />
<br />
   I haven't been anywhere in PooP where I can't be a viable tank yet, for an XP hunt.  Only have up to Tactics atm though.<br />
<br />
Pick the highest AC stuff you can find, but get the highest hps in EVERY SLOT you can find.  So many people have a few very high HP/AC pieces they have won on raids,  but neglect the small slots.  It adds up.  Also, pack as much stamina onto your gear as you can, as third priority. Anything else IMHO is secondary to an xp group tank.<br />
<br />
 Farm cash like a maniac to juggle gear, and sooner or later your SK will be one of the (if not THE) most desired tanks in the game for xp groups in PoP.  Always with the caveat that the person behind him isn't an idiot, of course:)<br />
