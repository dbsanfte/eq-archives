<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Oagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Most shamans don't see end game levels.  Those that do, which I'm not, appear to have some legitimate gripes.  GoD brought out some healing issues that makes them feel fairly useless.  End game players don't need stat buffs (other than focus).  GoD mobs die before a slow can land (if you malo/slow).  GoD mobs die before a DoT runs it course.  Their nukes are about as pathetic as ours (ice based).  In GoD, they're reduced to a tag a long class (kinda like us?).  They want a better heal to make them a viable alternative if a cleric isn't available.  Pre-GoD, they do well.  Decent equipped shaman are soloing in Fire.  That's not bad.<br />
<br />
The majority of shaman that are not Time or better level...nope, they're still a viable class, and really don't have a lot to gripe about.  Although they could be given a better heal that doesn't drop as a rare in some place most can't go.<br />
<br />
With the game going to lvl 70, it will be interesting to see where this class and Shamans go.</div></div><hr />
