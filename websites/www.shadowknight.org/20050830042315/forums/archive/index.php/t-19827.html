<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigher</div><div class="date">02-04-2004, 10:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm currently 80% into level 57 and trying to grind out to 60 as fast as possible.  LDoN groups are producing horrible exp, due to the fact that I'm usually the highest level in the group (for tanking purposes).<br />
<br />
Lately, I have had a rough time finding groups other than LDoN, so I'm looking for a zone and more specifically a camp spot that a SK could solo to pull in some serious exp.....dont care about loot or pp dropping just want the exp!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rus</div><div class="date">02-04-2004, 12:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ditto on the whole thing. Even the level. I need a specific camp - Some undead would be great. Out of all the zones and places their has to be at least 1.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Best xp you're going to find at your level.  Even lt blues in PoJ are going to give blue xp of some other zones, because of xp modifier.<br />
<br />
You may be able to be add'l melee in PoV/PoS.  You might have problems gettting a group as MA there, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ashrai</div><div class="date">02-04-2004, 01:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Give tanking in PoV a try, I started MA'ing there at 57 and had no problems as long as mob was slowed on incoming- and I had very substandard gear. Just try to get some friends together and go make a group at LCY or RCY- it will be hard to get a group as MA from strangers at 57.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigher</div><div class="date">02-05-2004, 10:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the info on spots to camp, however this raises another question for me.  I've seen in this thread and a few others that PoJ jail cells is a good place to solo.<br />
<br />
Most of the time when I'm exp hunting while solo, I use the fear kite method.  I can't imagine that this would go over too well with the mutiple roamers that pace the hallways.  Without the use of fear kite it would have to be a toe to toe battle and at my level dont believe that is going to be too efficient, or am I just that badly equipped which I dont believe is the case.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stugein</div><div class="date">02-05-2004, 10:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm 55 and can solo the jail cell area.  I usually stick to melee mobs (most prisoners and the guardians).  If you can't toe-to-toe them just dark em with your highest dark then load them up with your other DoTs.  Stay out of their melee range and spear/tap them every once and awhile.  Takes a minute or two, but at 55 most mobs are dead or close to it after just a lap or two around the cell block.  Once they get low melee them to finish them off and to preserve mana.<br />
<br />
As for the roamers, it really isn't a problem.  The rats do not assist the prisoners, however the Guardians will and the rats will assist the guardians.  So long as you keep the hall cleared of guardians, roamers should not be an issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Putrid</div><div class="date">02-05-2004, 12:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fear does not work in POJ.  So fear kiting is out.  Pulling toward the zoneline is the safe way, unfortunately groups are often there.  The guards and rats dont go down the hallway to the zone line, so this is safe from adds.  Make sure you have them snared late in the battle, so they dont walk back to the cell area.  That is a good way to get adds.  This is a good place to use your pet.<br />
POD and Nadox are a good place to fear kite if you like doing that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dexk</div><div class="date">02-10-2004, 11:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A few tips for soloing in PoJ at 57:<br />
<br />
1)  If you stay in the first cell block area, then you wont have any adds.  Below level 57, you will have adds.<br />
<br />
2)  As long as your resists are decent, the easiest prisoners are Zenok, Thrakk, and the shortie near Sslarm(sp?).  They are casters.  <br />
<br />
3)  Avoid Sslarm(sp?), sentrys, and the chealer prisoners.<br />
<br />
4)  Some of the prisoners HT, so send in Jobaro first.<br />
<br />
5)  Dont waste your time on the rats, they give very little xp.<br />
<br />
6)  Agro kiting takes too long, just tank them.  Get Virtue and or KEI if needed.  Bandaids and regen bp will help with downtime.<br />
<br />
7)  Fight in the jail cells against a wall, so that you can channel lifetaps if needed.<br />
<br />
Good luck,<br />

Same story here. Had a few great groups in lcy and pon exit. Pretty quick xp. Just tough to get a group together.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiester Smellybottom</div><div class="date">02-20-2004, 12:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You also might consider Veksar.  Good exp and chance for some loot.  Plus lots of undead.</div></div><hr />

I can do them at 55</div></div><hr />

PoD Right castle or left castle is good till 60<br />
Crypt of Decay Gy mostly heh<br />
PoV is great xp even passed 65 and aa imo<br />
<br />
those are the zones i went from 55-65 in...</div></div><hr />

At 57 my shaman can solo 1/2 the ent mobs with no huge issues.  Specific camps are prolly requiring a duo (church, etc.)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dyrkk</div><div class="date">02-27-2004, 04:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">At 57 you're nearly at the end of your least efficient period for soloing...Unfortunately, no matter how much more efficient you get, soloing for normal exp still won't really be a great idea at any level from 58 to 65. At best, it can be a decent option later on to do AA exp at odd hours.<br />
<br />
All the same, your aggro kiting isn't going to come to fruition until you get better DoT and snare spells. Aggro kiting a mob around with Dooming Darkness, Boil Blood, and the 52/58 pet chasing it = something a Necro can do at L 39-44.<br />
<br />
Fear kiting in a few select spots might still be decent, especially certain indoor zones where 'advantageous' fear pathing and good zem% are both availible. Finding the line between being clever and blatantly using an exploit is a good skill to learn. Even though the GMs aren't sneaking around spying on everyone like the old days, you don't want to be that guy getting ahead in EQ by hitting &quot;Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A, Start&quot;...although all weapons and 30 extra lives sounds pretty nice for this GoD stuff...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Me and a bunch of guildies are well know in The zone of Velketors Labyrinth... I suggest this zone from 45 up, as we have a SK in our guild that Train pulls 8-12 mobs all at once, and our healer keeps him alive easily.  Also they have some uber drops in this zone. xp is great also, I just started grouping here at level 51, and our Cleric has zipped from level 52-62 in no time at all. Our SK went from 48-60 in no time as well, and they recommend this zone over tier 1 planes anyday.<br />
Also if you are higher level, AA xp is very easy to get here also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ashigaru</div><div class="date">03-02-2004, 11:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I solo'd 55 to 61 in Velks when my gear was fairly suck-tastic (Much like it is now lol). However, I did this on VS, where the zone is exceptionally quiet... it may be the same on US servers, it may not.<br />
<br />
Pull Spider / Statue to Zone Line, darken, fear, kite. Depending on your DPS fear will drop once or twice, and darken may drop once. Get KEI if you can, as its not too long a run to PoK to rebuff. <br />
<br />
Cash is OK as velium sells well.<br />
<br />
Compares fairly well vs. tier one planar exp.<br />
<br />
After level 61 most mobs go LB. However, by that time you should be well able to tank PoV, and have got some upgrades, from bazaar if necessary<br />
<br />
Edit... Aaaaand looked at your magelo, you're 61 now, and likely tanking in PoV.<br />

<br />
SSra comm 1 or 2 is decent<br />
<br />
Temple of Droga is good too, and has nice exp bonus. I hate the nasty caster goblins though<br />
<br />
High Diff LDON with group average lvl greater than 58 gives around 1 yellow per adv.<br />
<br />
Basically, I don't solo unless there is absolutely nothin else going on. Solo exp is a grind, and besides its more fun to group up and kick some shyt</div></div><hr />
