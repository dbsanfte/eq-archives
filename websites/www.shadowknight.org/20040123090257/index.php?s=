December 19, 2003 <br />
------------------------------ <br />
<br />
** Shadowhaven Casino goes on vacation ** <br />
<br />
We're sorry to have to say this, but the new casino has become too popular. The huge number of players gambling at the casino is causing issues with the servers, and has been responsible for a few zone crashes. Unfortunately, this means that we have had to remove the casino NPCs until after the New Year arrives. <br />
<br />
<br />
* Other Changes * <br />
<br />
- Cancel magic will no longer remove disciplines or melee abilities. <br />
<br />
- Fixed a bug that was causing the party to be unable to see hit point updates for the last person to join their group. <br />
<br />
- Healing Will and Focused Will now stack with most other hit point regeneration effects. <br />
<br />
- Corrected a bug that was causing AAs to increase the duration of combat abilities. <br />
<br />
- We have reorganized the context menu for Disciplines to make it a bit more logical.

December 18, 2003 <br />
------------------------------ <br />
<br />
Headlines! <br />
<br />
Melee Enhancements Part 1 <br />
New Spell Effects Live <br />
Casino Now Open In Shadowhaven <br />
HEAR YE! HEAR YE! Check with your Town Crier for new editions of your hometown paper! <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
*** AA REFUND *** <br />
<br />
- Extended Notes 3 and Sionachie's Cresendo have been refunded (More details below). If you had these bard AAs and were close to 30 AA points stored, make certain that you spend enough points to have 30 or less unspent AA points before you zone. All AA points over 30 are removed when you zone. <br />
<br />
- Improved Reclaim Energy has been refunded to magicians due to changes with the amount of energy received when cannibalizing their pets. If you have this Magician AA and were close to 30 AA points stored, make certain that you spend enough points to have 30 or less unspent AA points before you zone. All AA points over 30 are removed when you zone. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
** Melee enhancements ** <br />
<br />
We have been building an enhancement to the melee system, and the first part of it is now Live. <br />
<br />
The yellow bar now represents endurance rather than stamina. <br />
<br />
All Disciplines now require an expenditure of endurance to use. They still have a re-use timer, and they can't be used more often than the timer allows. <br />
<br />
Disciplines have now been divided into a few different timers. <br />
<br />
We have also added a few of the new melee skills to the game. These are the skills that do not use the new "opening" system, but can be used without an opening present. The "reactionary" skills and the opening system will remain on Test for further tuning. <br />
<br />
Warriors have been given a mitigation boost. This affects all warriors at all levels. <br />
<br />
Monks have been given the ability to dodge blows from attackers behind them. This affects all monks with the Dodge ability. <br />
<br />
All existing disciplines can be purchased as tomes in either East Commons or the Plane of Knowledge. To learn a discipline, the Tome must be turned into your guildmaster. <br />
<br />
Several new disciplines have been added for warriors, monks and rogues who are above level 60. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
** Play King's Court in Shadowhaven! ** <br />
<br />
Shandeling's Roost in Shadowhaven now houses a game of chance. To play you will need to buy a King's Court Token. You then take this token and turn it in to any of the dealers. Based on what your hand turns out to be, you will be awarded a prize. The highest hands will return a gold ticket as the prize. This Ticket can be turned in to win prizes such as a Guise of the Deceiver, Fungus Covered Great Staff, or Holgresh Elder Beads. Good luck to all that play! <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
** Items ** <br />
<br />
- Purchased augments, that have not been bound to an item yet, can be sold back to Dible Hedledrap in South Ro. <br />
<br />
- Caerlyna in the Bazaar will trade your containers for tokens and will trade tokens for containers. This will allow player characters to sell those tokens in the Bazaar. Folks that buy the tokens can then take them to the Caerlyna and trade them in for the appropriate container. You can exchange most weight reducing tradeable containers for a token. <br />
<br />
- We've changed the +12 Wis on the Copper Medal of Rapture to +12 Int. Really, we have! <br />
<br />
- We have lowered the minimum duration to 5 ticks on Affliction Efficiency I-IV and Affliction Haste I-IV foci. <br />
<br />
- Timeless Coral Greatsword will no longer claim to be out of charges when it procs. If you own one of these swords, you will need to petition a GM and ask them to replace your current Coral Greatsword with a new one. <br />
<br />
- Phylactery is no longer useable by all classes, only MAG NEC ENC WIZ CLR SHA DRU. <br />
<br />
- The Delightful Orb of Forgotten Magic now only procs for characters level 35 and above. <br />
<br />
- The following items that had the Invigor effect now have Serpent Sight or Ultravision: Orb of the Crimson Bull, Abram's Axe of the Stoic, Tolan's Darkwood Boots, Mrylokar's Greaves, Singing Steel Vambraces, Crown of Rile, 5 Dose Potion of Wolves Blood, 5 Dose Potion of Fleeting Languor, 10 Dose Potion of Wolves Blood, 10 Dose Potion of Fleeting Languor, Potion of Wolves Blood, Potion of Fleeting Languor, Spiroc Wingblade, Spirit Caller's Boots, Spirit Weaver's Boots, Frozen Efreeti Boots, Ring of the Crimson Bull, Rune Crafter's Boots, Wolf Caller's Boots and Camii's Bracer of Vigor. <br />
<br />
- The effects on Abram's Axe of the Stoic and Spiroc Wingblade are now Worn to activate, not procs. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
** Spells/Songs ** <br />
<br />
- New spell effects! Just about every spell in the game has been given a new spell effect. If you have your spell effects turned off, you may want to turn them back on. <br />
<br />
- Fixed the bard AA Channeling Focus. It was allowing 100% recovery from missed notes in most instances. We have restored it to the 5%/10%/15% values as documented in the AA window. <br />
<br />
- Fixed a problem with short-duration pets (Rage of Zomm, cleric hammers, wizard flaming swords and such) so that they will no longer dissipate before engaging the target NPC. <br />
<br />
- Reclaim Energy will now return 75 percent of the mana used to summon the pet, 95 percent if the caster has Improved Reclaim Energy. <br />
<br />
- Lull spells with duration less than 5 should no longer be lasting as if they had duration 5. This will reduce the duration of some lull-type spells to their proper duration. <br />
<br />
- Fixed a problem that caused Protection of the Nine to block Blessing of the Nine. <br />
<br />
- We corrected an issue where the same druid damage over-time spell cast on an NPC by two different druids would not stack. <br />
<br />
- Bulwark of Vie was reducing spell damage as well as melee damage. It now only reduces melee damage. <br />
<br />
- Eye of Zomm will no longer cause players summoned pets to suicide if commanded to kill the eye. <br />
<br />
- Improved the melee damage on pets focused by Ritual Summoning. <br />
<br />
- The magician epic pet can now Enrage when focused by Minion of Darkness. <br />
<br />
- Increased the offensive capabilities of most pets when focused by Summoner's Boon. <br />
<br />
- We have removed the Stamina effects from many spells. <br />
<br />
- Fixed a bug that would cause issues with pet hit points, and could cause them to be unable to move if their hit points got too low. This may also address other issues with pets using hit-point boosting items. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
** Alternate Advancement ** <br />
<br />
- Extended Notes 3 and Sionachie's Cresendo have been refunded. If you had these bard AAs and were close to 30 AA points stored, make certain that you spend enough points to have 30 or less unspent AA points before you zone. All AA points over 30 are removed when you zone. You may, of course, repurchase these AAs. <br />
<br />
- Extended Notes and Sionachie's Cresendo no longer affects harmful area-of-effect spells. <br />
<br />
- Jamfest has been fixed. It will now affect the bard's group, not just the bard. <br />
<br />
- The Archetype AA ability Spell Casting Deftness was not reducing the casting time for the wizard spell Harvest. It does now. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
** Tradeskills ** <br />
<br />
- Merchants will not pay more for a tradeskill product than the cost of the components needed to make it. However, they will still sell those products for the same amount. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
** Zones and Quests ** <br />
<br />
- Maelin will now respond as though you have the Quintessence, as long as you are flagged for time. It is also now possible to receive any of the earlier progression flags, even if you have already earned access to the Plane of Time. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
** User Interface ** <br />
<br />
- Tell windows now log the name of the person sending tells in the chat log. <br />
<br />
- Tell windows now blink when a tell is received, even when the window is not minimized. <br />
<br />
- Fixed a problem that caused users some ATI cards to be unable to see the /find path or the targeting ring. <br />
<br />
- We have added a new combat ability windown which allows you to make up to eight hot keys for disciplines and other new melee abilities and displays any current melee effects. The window can be opened by pressing Alt+C. The keys are accessible using either the mouse or Ctrl+1-8. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
** Miscellaneous ** <br />
<br />
- Added some explanation text to the targetindicator.ini file that help explain how to modify the targeting ring. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

Over the last few days there has been a growing community concern about possible cheating, exploiting and platinum duplication.  Rumors and speculation have begun to run rampant, and I've received a lot of concerned email on the topic.<br />
<br />
First of all, I want to thank you for your concern.  The fact that you worry about this stuff as much as we do makes me feel good about the community that I work for.  I want to especially thank those that have sent in detailed information about what they thought might be dupe or exploit situations.  That information has been very helpful.<br />
<br />
With your help, we have been able to discover and eliminate some unusual ways of cheating.  Obviously I can't go into detail about exactly how this cheating was done.  I can tell you that several of our programmers and designers took lengthy breaks from working on their current tasks to define, investigate and smash those exploits.  Most of these methods for cheating have been removed.  The few that remain will be fixed shortly.  We will be watching, and anyone using them will be banned.<br />
<br />
At the same time, our Customer Service folks have been diligently tracking down the cheaters.  We have banned accounts and deleted characters in the hundreds.  It's never a good thing to be forced to remove so many accounts, and we're not happy that such cheating was possible.  We are pleased, however, to let you know that we are confident that we have located the majority of those that exploited the game and have removed their characters or accounts.<br />
<br />
Obviously we won't be able to prevent all of the possible ways to cheat.  The folks that insist on trying to cheat have proven to be persistent and clever (and here is where I wonder why they don't apply that energy and skill to something beneficial...).  We need your help to locate these issues.  The multitude of eyes and ears of our players is always the best source of information for us.  If you ever suspect that you have discovered something that seems like an exploit, please send that information to us through the Developer's Corner AND through /bug.  Please don't assume we have heard the information already.  We'd rather have ten reports about something like this than none.<br />
<br />
I'd also like to address a rumor about the nature of some of the cheating that people have been talking about.  There has been speculation in the community that in order to pull off some of the rumored exploits someone had to be working on the "inside".<br />
<br />
We take such possibilities very seriously.  And we have investigated this very thoroughly.  We keep track of all special EverQuest commands issued.  We have looked into the possibility that someone working here had a hand in helping others cheat, and we have discovered no evidence that indicates that to be the case.  Also, the nature of the cheat did not require such inside help.  I can't describe the cheat method in any detail, but there was an experience cheat that allowed extremely fast leveling.  This required some rather sophisticated cheating, but was being done without inside help.  Obviously we have removed that exploit and banned any accounts that used it.<br />
<br />
Thank you for playing EverQuest.  And thank you for you help making the game fun.<br />
<br />
Have a great holiday season.<br />
<br />
<br />

EverQuest Chat on November 24th at 6:00pm - 7:00pm pacific time. Melee System Enhancements!<br />
<br />
<a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/chat.jsp" target="_blank">CHAT LINK</a><br />
<br />
You've been asking for them and now we're ready to discuss them. We're taking a big departure from what many of you are used to when it comes to combat. With that in mind, here is a brief summary of these exciting enhancements to better help you target your questions to us during the live chat. Don't worry if you miss the chat, we'll post the logs on EverQuestLive.com<br />
<br />
    * Increase the contributions melee classes provide in a group setting<br />
    * Address the current deficit between the pure melee classes and other classes<br />
    * Add more depth and potential for skilled play to melee combat<br />
    * Provide a system that encourages attentiveness and decision-making skills, without focusing heavily on twitch gameplay<br />
<br />
<br />
Take advantage of an opponent's weakness. See an opening, strike home for the kill!<br />
<br />
Monks, Rogues and Warriors will gain the ability to recognize certain weaknesses in an opponent's defense. These "Openings" will be a variety of types and can occur based on several different situations during combat. Be quick though, an opening will not present itself for long. Strike quick with a new combat skill once your character recognizes an opening. These new combat skills are being designed just for this combat system revision. Using and maintaining these skills expends the character's Endurance (a new statistic, calculated from the character's basic stats).<br />
<br />
<br />
Here's a combat example:<br />
<br />
A warrior is serving as the tank for his group, standing in front of a goblin. While battling the goblin, the warrior makes an exceptional parry and is presented with an opening. An indicator appears with the "opening icon" and the word "Parry" next to it (this information also appears in the chat window).<br />
<br />
Now is his opportunity to strike back after the exceptional parry! Only certain combat skills can be used to react to a parry opening. Other types of openings will allow the use of other skills. Some skills may be usable in response to more than one type of opening. Also, your position in relation to the target can change the effectiveness of certain skills.<br />
<br />
In this case, our warrior knows that he can use one of three combat skills, each having some merit. One might stun the target, one might increase the hate generated by the warrior for a few rounds, and one might make it easier for everyone to hit the NPC.<br />
<br />
In this case, our warrior elects to try to stun the goblin. He presses the appropriate button and luck smiles upon him as he successfully executes the strike, leaving the goblin standing dumbly for a combat round.<br />
<br />
Increasing Your Endurance and Learning New Skills<br />
<br />
    * Increase Endurance by increasing attributes or by acquiring special items that directly increase your Endurance pool<br />
    * Find tomes or instructions manuals and take them to specific trainers to learn new skills<br />
    * Choose your skills from skill categories (such as Tactical) containing skills focused to a purpose<br />
    * Most openings are available only to a single character, but some are available to all nearby characters<br />
    * Disciplines will be transferred to this new system<br />
    * Existing Discipline timers will be reviewed, and several will probably be set to their own timer<br />
    * Disciplines will require an Endurance cost<br />
    * Hybrids will receive a limited Endurance pool for their disciplines<br />
<br />
There will be other changes as well. Keep your eyes on the Test server and our update messages for more details as we move forward.<br />
<br />
This new system is much more flexible than the existing disciplines. It will be relatively easy to add new combat skills, as well as new skills that are not limited to openings. This system creates the possibility for tremendous enhancement in the future, allowing groups a large number of options when it comes to melee combat.<br />
<br />
Talk to you in the Live Chat!<br />
