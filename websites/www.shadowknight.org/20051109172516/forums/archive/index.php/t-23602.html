first quest is for nice pair of gloves, have to kill 18 or so falleng uardians, real easy they are in commons out west. then you have to kill a named guy, cant exactlly remember his name, i think its somethin blackblade or something, he is in the outpost between the two merchants with piggies and live stock, he was white with 2 up arrows to me at 20<br />
<br />
killed him with a cleric, a guardian and a chanter of similar levels, not so bad.<br />
<br />
second part is for bracer, ahven't finished it yet cause its a pain to find a group that wants to go deep into fallen gate.</div></div><hr />

If I remember correctly its:<br />
Hands<br />
Forearms<br />
Feet<br />
Shoulders<br />
Legs<br />
Chest<br />
<br />
So you'll get sleeves from the second part.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't have a map, but I can direct you do the mobs, which are you looking for?  <br />
<br />
It's been a couple days, and I'm way over-tired, but here's where I think the mobs are...<br />
<br />
for AQ1, the Fallen Crusaders are in the Ruins of Varmarr in the Commonlands.  The named you need to &quot;talk&quot; to is at the crossroads, he'll be white ++ to you at 20.  <br />
<br />
for AQ2, go into the pool room, follow the waterfall up into the cave, keep veering left, you'll get to what ppl have been calling Market2.  You may need rats for this?  If so, read the AQ3 directions... <br />
<br />
for AQ3, from the pool room, go through the small cavern and down... you'll find constructs, rats, corpses, etc. here.  <br />
<br />
There are safe pull spots for all of these, go charging in and you'll surely get wiped.<br />
<br />
EDIT: I knew I should have just left this alone today... in a fog.</div></div><hr />

What's the name of the armor pieces?  I've been doing searches looking for stats etc. and can't find anything.

Good luck, it's not hard with a good group.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the info man, it's just the fact that the map system in EQ2 blows hard core, the maps in EQ1 where just so much better.  I just finished AQ2 yesterday and I am going to work on AQ3 today I hope and get it done.  Thanks again.</div></div><hr />

My toon is level 21, and I am done with AQ1 - 3.  Next one is in Edgewater.  So what level do I need to be to be able to tank those mobs?  Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiester Smellybottom</div><div class="date">12-07-2004, 01:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Edgewater is the suck but the loot is incredible.   Chests dropped just about every encounter and the weapons are nice.  I got plenty of 25+ adepts, a feysteel sai, steel vanguard and other stuff.    It sucks because without a chanter you will probably die and the problem is that you can't retrieve your shard by right clicking on the zone entrance.  Our group was 23-25.  Get a good chanter, and the exp/loot is awesome.  We were the only group in the zone so I don't know if that affected the drop rate of the chests and also we killed a couple of nameds in there too.   It is a high risk zone, we died several times but we usually made up the debt by the time we got to our shards.   Selling the loot that I got from there, I've made over 10gold so far.   Please note that the zone is a bit buggy, sometimes when we revived we ended up in different instances.</div></div><hr />

I noticed the same thing that Kiester did. <br />
Edgewater had some GREAT drops. The group I was with was really good, but some of the battles tested us pretty hard. <br />
And, there's at least one quest that starts (and ends) inside there as well, so if you plan to spend time there, you can even do at least one quest. :)<br />
<br />
Best part is, the place seemed to be empty the entire day we were there. No over-crowding (at least yet). ;)<br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />

Oh yah if you guys want a bp to hold you for a little while till you get the coldhammered bp, get the Heavy Elephant Hide Vanguard (http://eq2players.station.sony.com/en/item.vm?itemId=6393) its really nice and should keep me nice and cosey till I get the bp at 25 or so. It also looks cool.</div></div><hr />

Yarana in Longhsadow gives it out.  That what I've been using until I can get the AQ one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm to the point where Yarana wants me to go to FG to kill slime sacs.  Worse, the quest is tagged as green already.</div></div><hr />
