<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Arangar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">been searching for this...can anyone confirm if he is in fact moved to FM, or if he still spawns in his old spot?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Talonmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">He has been moved to the cave with the rest of the named droga spawns in the FM.  Saw him there myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tantrissa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I can also confirm this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vezax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">He is in the same cave as gobby traitor.  I got my 2nd ring last week.<br />
<br />
Edit: He was in cave in FM, south of droga.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Smyrt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Be careful you don't aggro the Traitor. We did, somehow, and I took a BIG faction hit from max Ally down to whatever is just below Ally. I know I didn't hit him but I think he hit me and my pet smacked him.<br />
<br />
I had to slaughter all the goblins in the caves for about 90 minutes before I got back to Ally. I saved all the skins/salts that dropped and they got be back to max Ally.<br />
<br />
Traitor respawns almost immediately, and you can use him to /con if necessary since he's on Di'Zok faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>chardrok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Aye, singled this guy at 62.  Best to take him outside of the cave for some running room.  I got tired of running in tight circles in the little cave.  Clear all the gobby's in the room before you tackle him.  You can clear the gobby's down the hall to the door if you want to be able to pull him out.  (not necessary if you want to invis and run past them)  He does cast fear, but it didn't  stick for long on me.</div></div><hr />
