<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would think you would need alot of AA to pull this off and be level 65 with good gear.<br />
<br />
I am 65 with probably sub par gear as I have only just started to raid. There is no way I could solo hiim given my gear set up. He hits for a max of 170 and is pretty fast, adds would be a HUGE problem down there if you were the slightest bit out of position.<br />
<br />
Also his PH can be caster types, wizards, shaman, clerics.. all are trouble and lord forbid you get a runner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valkyria Grymreaper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Been killing this guy for a couple days, still no shard. Trying to buy one but in the meantime will keep trying.<br />
<br />
He can be done solo this is what I do:<br />
<br />
Pull from near CharB ent. Using a bow and...something else...I tag him once roamer is away from hut. Only the spawn and one dog comes - I guess they are linked. Once they are close to CharB zone, snare him. Zone into CharB.<br />
<br />
Zone back out and he will be alone. Beat him down, keep snared DON'T let him run. I used lifetap and Bond of Death in the fight.<br />
<br />
I am ally to Chardok, so tried a couple times to dot him heavy when at 2-3% - Festering, Asystole and Blood of Hate -  and zone into CharB to not take a faction hit. No dice. Both times when I came out he was trying to swim back to spawn point and was about 50% health. Thinking dots where off when I zoned maybe? Not sure, but won't work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Theemop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Where exactly is the Chardok B zone in from where the shack is?  I've checked maps of the zone but no one seems to have that marked on them.  Here is a link with some maps can you give me an idea where on the map it is?  Maybe tell me the closest numbered item it is by?<br />
