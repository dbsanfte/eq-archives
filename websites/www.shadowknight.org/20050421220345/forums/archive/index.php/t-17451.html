<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bradven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Sorry to ask folks, just curious what typical prices ranges were on this item.  I've seen it range from 250pp to 20k and nothing consistantly.<br />
<br />
Is there a general consensus on what it runs?  I play on TT if anyone on that server has any insight, but all server info welcome :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">On Zeb, I paid 2k for it.  Well worth the price for someone who can't manage to get in on a raid down to the Herb Shack.  Hell, I even went on a couple that were held for a Necro friend, but she got her herb long before I ever saw the shard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rashakra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I paid 18k last night on Tribunal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Jeebus, does Tribunal suffer from ridiculous price inflation or something?<br />
<br />
The guy that sold me the shard also MQ'd the Mirror for me, as he had a necro that wanted epic and the urn from drusella, and he was going to do the Mirror for free.  I felt like I couldn't take that, since he was helping me out so much and I wanted to make some sacrifice for not having been able to get the items on my own, so I paid him for both, but it still only came out to 4k total.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i paid 100pp for mine on fennin lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>MasterVicker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I got mine for freem the guy wanted 10k for it and I haggled him so bad he just screw it and gave it to me.  People try and sell those things for ungodly amounts for months lol.  Its absolutly rediculous.  On a small scale most sks have only heard whispers of the greenmist and when they see it they are in aw.  I would not have payed more than 2k for it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>xorrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">around 3k on TM</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rathbern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I found the shard in the Bazaar for 5k.  So i looked in my bank, saw only 1.2k.. SO trader mode for a week.  Logged on this morning, had 14k, sold a Bracer of Fortitude and Shrunken Goblin Skull.  SO I thought cool. <br />
<br />
The guy who had the shard was on, but told me he sold it last night.:mad: <br />
<br />
That is my kind of timing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rathbern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">So  I spend some of my plat get a ring and an earring, save 5k in the bank (you never know when another will show).  Poof today Greenish Metal shard... 8k...  AHHHHHHH<br />
<br />
<br />
...sigh....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Never hurts to send a tell and see if the guy will come down on it.  I have a friend who makes haggling into an art.  Consequently, he has paid up to 5k under asking price for items that he wanted, just by being patient and persistant.  Figure out what you want to spend and then send the guy a tell and ask if he'll accept it.  Most of the people that have these quest items up are really just looking to make a quick profit off of someone who is desperate, but they realize that there isn't much of a demand for the item, and when you come right down to it, the thing is taking up bank space that could be used for more profitable (and better marketable) items.<br />
<br />
Here in the US, we have been beaten down by the notion that what someone wants for something is what they'll take for it.  We're not used to haggling, since most everyone buys their goods at large chain stores.  The price tag says what the price tag means.  However, in some other countries, haggling is a way of life, and EQ is not just a US game.   Give it a shot, the worst that can happen (presuming you're polite about it) is that the guy will say &quot;no deal&quot; and you'll have to raise the rest of the cash or wait for another to come up at the price you want.<br />
<br />
If you really can't afford to pay that much for it, another option is to become the newest close personal friend of a Necro who is working on his/her epic.  Check your server boards for posts asking for Necro Epic help, then hop in on some raids.  They'll eventually have to go get the Mansi Herb, and the GMS drops near the herbshack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kowl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I payed 1K tonight on Kane Bayle for the Mirror. The GMS is all I have left but I have never seen one in the bazaar or on the market channel on Kayne Bayle. I have no problem fighting my way through Chardok to get it but no one ever wants to go. My guild is raiding Chardok this weekend but it is such a rare drop I really am not expecting to get it while we are there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>RazbkukBB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Got luck last night. Logged in someone 2 people selling Histiry of Greenmist (one for 3500, one for 250pp ) I got the cheap one :)<br />
<br />
The saw Greenish Metal Shard for sale for 500pp :)<br />
<br />
You're looking at one happy Troll :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Raghoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Has anyone heard of the greeish shard dropping in chardox B?  I have killed there a little bit and have pick up some nice items that drop off named in chardox.  If this is true it would work out well for keeping my chardox faction for my AoB bracer that I want so bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Greenish Metal Shard drops off of one mob only (though IIRC, there can be more than one of this particular mob up at any given time) in Chardok.  He hangs around the Herb Shack.  And if what I've seen is any indication, the GMS is NOT his common drop.<br />
<br />
So, no, nothing in Chardok B will drop it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Area</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">After approximately 75 hours of camping the Alchemist Alcolyte, I ended up with 9 Di'Zok escape staffs, 4 Vile Sarnak Brews, 2 Staves of Shielding, 1 Burnished Wooden Stave, 5 Sandwiches of Foul Smelling Herbs, 7 pairs of some crappy arms, 1 Iksar Hide Cloak, and 0 Greenish Metal Shards. 13 Alch spawns and no shard.<br />
<br />
Logged on this morning and found it in Bazaar for 6k. Overpriced but 75 hours in that camp will make you do strange things, so I bought it and didn't think twice. Had been checking Bazaar for about 5 months and never saw it before so I probably would have gone to 10k just to get the damned quest over with hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sikasila</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Saw three in the bazaar last night on Quellious, 3k, 10k, and 20k. 3k well spent as I have been looking for the shard for 4 months.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Odiumar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">It was 1k on Tarrew Marr.  However, I've seen it for 10k as well.  /shrug     Timing is everything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Theemop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Bought one on Luclin last night for 5k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Rathbern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">10K<br />
<br />
BUT FINALLY CLOSE TO BEING NEAR DONE!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>XebarisTP</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Saw it for 10k yesterday.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Naaklum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Paid 10k after NEVER seeing one for sale for months, and several trips to Herbalist camp.  Couldn't get anyone to go after several attempts.  Saw it for 6k 3 days later /shrug.  Oh well I have my friggin quest done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Heavenzsin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I can't find any on Lany's</div></div><hr />
