<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Draven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, i hear tons of people saying, &quot;Shadowknights always get stiffed on abilities and spells, blah blah&quot;.  Well personally i think its pretty fair, we can tank and dot we are the only ones who can do that. So wat we can't gate and junk. But hey since i'm a fair sport i have come up with a plan(a plan, not a great plan) to increase the abilities and skills, (and maybe the races) of shadowknights. Its very simple. Just...<br />
<br />
Every who wishes to help send an email to, doyle@rpglore.com<br />
He (or she not 100% sure, but i think its a he) and in that email jsut complain and say something along the lines of, &quot;Its unfair sk's  dont get even abilities land skills like other classes, blah blah blah, please make a patch to change this, blah blah blah, whine whine whine.&quot; And presto chango IF ENOUGH people whine and complain it SHOULD be changed. But it jsut cant be a couple of people im talking alot. And since Doyle is the Administrator / Active Server Page Programmer then he has power to make changes. So send in those emails. Like i said before i tihnk shadowknights have it pretty good, but hey if we can whine and get a little more of an edge, I'm all for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>legoluss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">you know.....you gotta point there,we sk's should have a lot of things that we dont have,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mordin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">We are a mix between a Warrior and a Necro,  I think we should get a mix of spell's, skill's and abilities that they have.<br />
<br />
We are not part of any other class and I believe that if it dosen't pertain to those two classes we should not have a requirement of it.<br />
<br />
Yes it would be nice to Heal, Slow, Root.....ect.  That is not our role in the game though, and what purpose would it serve to spam someone who could help us out with other problems we SK's have or are gonna have with the new expansions.<br />
<br />
That's just my 2cp's, but I think that is not the way to go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sepcieulus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well to be honest ... I'm pretty happy with SK's as a whole.<br />
<br />
1. Our class is fun to play.<br />
2. Our class is one of the most survivable classes.<br />
3. Our class is pretty self sufficiant.<br />
<br />
Now just out of the box (disregarding equiptment) <br />
<br />
(in no real order ... just as they came to me ... and I'm sure I left somthing out ... and only speaking of the things I know I can do at my lvl.)<br />
<br />
Out of Sk's, Pallies, Rangers, and Bst .... <br />
<br />
<br />
1. FD<br />
2. Invis<br />
3. Enduring breath<br />
4. Lev<br />
5. A pet<br />
6. Atk buff<br />
7. Ac buff<br />
8. Snare<br />
9. DoT<br />
10. Inzone Telaport<br />
11. Invulnarability<br />
12. Damage shield.<br />
13. Fear<br />
14. IVU<br />
15. Str buff<br />
16. Summon Corpse<br />
17. Lifetap<br />
18. atk debuff<br />
19. ac debuff<br />
20. str debuff<br />
21. Casted melee proc<br />
22. HT<br />
23. Hate increase buff.<br />
24. Self Illusion<br />
25. Mana Regen<br />
26. AoE DD<br />
27. DD<br />
28. Fear undead<br />
29. Wear Plate armor<br />
<br />
<br />
How many do all that? How many can do half.<br />
<br />
Now can the others beat us in some of the listed things? Yes ... some can in some things.<br />
<br />
I feel we are a pretty well well rounded class.<br />
<br />
Do I think some of our equiptment choices compared to those are under par ... yes a little.<br />
<br />
Do I think some of the abilities they have are cool and would be nice to have ... yes some but they wouldn't fit with a necro/war combo.<br />
<br />
Do I think some of our spell choices compared to those are under par ... yes a little.<br />
<br />
Do I think it would be cool to have the option to dual wield ... yes a little but we like Pallies are Knights and I don't think it would fit.<br />
<br />
The others decend from buffers and healers (cleric, druid,shaman) we don't. Think about it.<br />
<br />
Overall we have a great class. We can do the damage, hold the aggro, and survive. Now there may be a few things that need tweeking just a bit but I don't think spamming a guy asking for the moon and stars is the best way to go about it. <br />
<br />
Get a serious thread going with a indepth logical look at our abilities at various lvls compared to those listed above while keeping a strict adhearance to our class and the necromatic arts. Draft a petition haveing the consensus of the general SK populus with the things and reasons they should be changed. Post this petition once it has been drawn up and have all willing SK's to copy and send it. For a large cordinated effort should yeild more results than a ton of random belly acheing bitching and moaning.<br />
<br />
If there is such a serious logical thread or effort on going ... please direct me there (I searched for &quot;Serious Logical SK tweeking thread&quot; and came up empty ... maybe I used the wrong search words ... lol).<br />
<br />
Take care guys ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Spylmann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Obligatory sarcastic &quot;hay gusy sks shoudl get gaet and rez rofflez&quot; response.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Valkyria Grymreaper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Bad thing here is I wasted 3 minutes of my life on this worthless thread I can never get back...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">1) Real SKs don't whine! We leave that to the rangers and druids<br />
2) With some AA's, we become nasty boys!<br />
<br />
<br />
My only sugggestions would be<br />
<br />
1) Up our 2HS skill to about 240, make us an expert in one weapon<br />
2) Increase the cap on fear and lower the resistance on our spears</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rykor Bloodscream</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ok, i hear tons of people saying, &quot;Shadowknights always get stiffed on abilities and spells, blah blah&quot;. <br />
<br />
You might have heard that back before PoP, yes.  The greatest spell ever was Death Peace at lvl 60, made us alot more powerful and made us a good a puller as monks, but that was it, IMHO.<br />
<br />
So wat we can't gate and junk. <br />
<br />
Alot of items with a gate on them, I carry: Worker's Sledgemallet for OT ---&gt; PoK Book ---&gt; other books.  Velium Vapors.  Potion of Frost (Halas port.)  I hope to win the Nexus Gate gloves soon.<br />
<br />

Sonnuvabitch...I KNEW it, I KNEW you were a druid !!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>legoluss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i agree with sepcieulus....we are a great class,we pull we slash we kill and survive we are up there with the worriors and i think we are one of the best classes of the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>legoluss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">we proly just need a few spells and armor pieces and we are fit</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>nnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">When the casters in my group can med without getting hit by monsters, I know then that we SKs have enough to do our jobs. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Puurrdy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The only thing I would really like to see are more SK only items instead of the majority of things being SK/Paladin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Romuluas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well what i would like too see is 2h abilities raised, Bash cap raised (we are knights WTF does a warrior have better bashing skills then a knight????) our 1h caps raised as well, and for those dambed cursed raids it would be nice to have archery around 150, but is neither here nor there. <br />
<br />
That IMHO is what sk's /pally's need to have raised , but as stated, with AA's we become even stronger then we were pre PoP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Darknyss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">they're upping Shield abilities soon, we already have weapons that create better damage, we don't 'need' our skill caps increased...<br />
<br />
perhaps a few upgrades to some spells, *cough* Zev's Bite *cough* and especially some expensive quest spells increased.. *double cough* Life Leech *cough*... would be nice.... but as previously stated... we don't whine... we silently suffer as real ShadowKnights would do...<br />
<br />
besides, bring too much attention to us and they'll start to rain the nerf bats down on us... look what happened to monks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Aoninie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">My wife has a mage 1 lvl below me. When we group I am always amazed at her ability to do damage with her spells and pet. We were both in Rathe today soloing. I would kick ass on one Hg, get an add, fear him, continue to fear kite the first, drop him as the adds fear wore off then drop him and still have 90% hps. She has one get by her pet and she's running for her life untill her pet roots again and is down to 30%. Made me relize we are some bad ass mo fo's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Calamity_Daemon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I love my SK. I love being the only one who comes out of the battle with more HPs than I started without the help of a retarded cleric of Tunare on my back every 24 secs. I like my wonderful abilities to solo and I solo quite nicely i believe. I like just puttin on my Darkforge and looking cool without and excuse. Maybe pimp around Freeport for awhile and kill some crappy guards and watch the newbies say &quot;Hey nice armor where did you get your sword. thats cool. hey do you have any items in the bank...blahblah&quot; At which point I lay the axe down into the guard and turn to them and say &quot;Jooz wanna stuf jooz gutta kill mez!!!&quot; then they go away...<br />
<br />
   But if SKs were to get anything I wouldnt mind gate. I dont mean like I WANT it but I mean sometimes i find it would be nice. Just for when like your in KC and like your bind is in Oggok or something like that. I am proud to be the best class in EQ. Paladins think they are all tough but when they LoH I just HT their @$$ back to hell. When a warrior is all like &quot;you are teh suc!!!11&quot; I just shadow step and DoT em and sick pet and watch them go crazy.<br />
<br />
<br />
Tip: when killing a warrior just use disease cloud after 1pct hp and watch them WANT you to kill them</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jobrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">So what is it about the Race Discussion forum that draws all the godmodding idiotic script-kiddy retards anyway?</div></div><hr />
