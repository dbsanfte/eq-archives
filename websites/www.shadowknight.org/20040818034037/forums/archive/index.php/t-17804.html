<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>zullean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">could someone tell me how to do the penance quest to get my pawns khukri back so i can work on other quest. at the moment i cant get any response from a guild master......Please help.<br />
<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Paynreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Please check out the Greenmist forum (do a search) i am SURE you can get an answer there. Also, if you have a friend who wants to make a throw-away newbie iksar SK, im sure he or she would be willing to MQ the Khukri to you. Its MUCH easier - again, details in the Greenmist forum =)<br />
<br />
(Also, if you're below level 10 or so, you might just want to remake the character if you are not attatched to him yet).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jexdawg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">This quest lets you get back your newbie robe/weapon in case you lost it so that you can do the quests that require it. Hail your Guild Master to start the quest. Each class starts a little different, but the phrases are pretty obvious. Once you get to the toilmaster, the path is the same. <br />
<br />
As an example, here is the necromancer version: <br />
<br />
You say, 'Hail Nihilist Zeegarn' <br />
<br />
Nihilist Zeegarn says 'Mind yourself within Cabilis. We will not tolerate any mischief. If you don't heed my warnings, you may be sentenced to the pit of the Crusaders of Greenmist. You don't want that! Also, you should always wear your robe when entering these walls. You do have your Drape of the Brood, correct? <br />
<br />
You say, 'I do not have my drape of the brood' <br />
<br />
Nihilist Zeegarn says 'What is this?' the Nihilist barks in disbelief. 'You have lost your drape? This is unacceptable! Take this note and report to the Toilmaster at once. Read it on the way and praise Cazic-Thule for any mercy that you may be granted!' <br />
<br />
Toilmaster Path. This part is the same for everyone. <br />
<br />
Then you get a book. Read it (it is quite interesting). Then go to East Cabilis and find the Toilmaster. Give him the book and... <br />
<br />
The Toilmaster looks at the tome and speaks to you, scowling, 'Very well Broodling, I have a task for you. I should make you work at the feet of my Froglok Slaves, crushing granite, but the lore of the Brood has a specific rite for this situation. Take this book and learn the will of Cazic-Thule. Read it and ask me any questions that you may have before you start your penance. It would be a shame for you to fail at this task as well... though I wouldn't mind destroying you.' <br />
<br />
Read the book, it tells you to ask him for the hammer and a bag. <br />
<br />
You say, 'Hail The Toilmaster' <br />
<br />
The Toilmaster says 'Do not bother me unless you wish to join the chain gang. Now go away or I shall have my slaves chop you as they chop this granite!' <br />
<br />
You say, 'I need the Hammer of Exoneration' <br />
<br />
The Toilmaster hands you a massive hammer and says, 'So, you can read. Good for you. Don't think that you're going to make an impression on me with that rubbish. Let's see if you can handle this hammer like you can that book, whelp.' <br />
<br />
(The Toilmaster hands you the Hammer of Exoneration, 4/60, effect: Bone Shatter, wt. 25.0. You have to make this thing proc 54 times.) <br />
<br />
You say, 'I need the bag' <br />
<br />
The Toilmaster turns his head to focus on you and hands you a dusty bag. He then returns to looking into the distance, just over your left shoulder. <br />
<br />
(Hands you an 8 slot bag, that you will put 7 Bone dusts in, and 1 bloodwater.) <br />
<br />
Next you go back to West Cabilis, in the building near the necro guild on the wall, there's a Mortician. He's a skelly, but he won't hurt you. <br />
<br />
You say, 'Hail a mortician' <br />
<br />
a mortician stares at you with hollow eye sockets. As he opens his jaw to speak, you are overcome by the foul smell of a thousand rotted corpses. 'What is your desire, master?' <br />
<br />
You say, 'I desire a mortar and pestle' <br />
<br />
a mortician moves with a mixture of creaks and clicks and produces a grotesque looking mortar and pestle set. He places the items in your hands and motions indicating you dismissal. You can feel the vile power of your god moving throughout the material that makes up the two items. <br />
<br />
This is what you combine the bone fragments in that you get. It's an 8 slot container. Here's the part where it gets BORING. I went to LoIO, there's lots of mobs there that you can fight for a long time without causing too much harm. If you get low on life, cast leach or something. <br />
<br />
When you do get 8 Bone Fragments, you combine them in the mortar and pestle and you get a white Powdered Bone. Put that in the bag. You need 7 of them. When you have 7 Powdered Bones, put one bloodwater in there and hit combine. Then turn that bag and the book you have into your guild master.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>cft2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">To start the quest as a SK, just walk up to each of the SK guild leaders, target them, and /say yes then /say no.<br />
<br />
That will answer the question &quot;Have you lost your Khurki like an idjit lizzard?&quot;  <br />
<br />
He will be ashamed of you and give you a book so you can redeem yourself.  Will take a couple hours unless you can get a nice dex buff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>XebarisTP</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">In the old days, you mq'd it yourself.<br />
<br />
Start a new SK, and hand in the newbie khukri.<br />
Log on to your real SK and hand in the other quest components.<br />
