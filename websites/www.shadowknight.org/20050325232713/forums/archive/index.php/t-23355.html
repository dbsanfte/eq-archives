<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jobrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Told myself I'd never make one of these threads, but hey, why not. <br />
<br />
Anyhow, my computer pretty much broke down back in June. Kaput, dead, done for. No chance of recovery. I managed to get a stopgap replacement computer thanks to a friend, but it pretty much works for web browsing, email, and IRC, and that's about it. And you can forget about EQ. <br />
<br />
So as a result, I haven't played in months, and It'll be several months more before I can afford a comp capable of playing EQ (At least without shirking on important stuff like, say, food, and tuition). <br />
<br />
If all goes well, I'll have my degree by next summer, and hopefully have a job that actually pays a decent amount, and I'll have a decent computer again, but when I get it, I don't think I'm gonna reactivate my EQ account. I still like EQ, and there was still some stuff I might have liked to do, but, meh. Roleplaying was always my favorite part of the game anyway, and I'm doing a lot more Pen and Paper stuff these days and having a blast. Hell, I'm thinking of LARPing. <br />
<br />
When I once again have A, a gaming rig, B, Money, and C, Free Time, I'll probably hop on WoW and/or EQ2. Maybe I'll see some of you there. <br />
<br />
Anyway, Gonna miss chatting with a lot of you in game, but hell, you've all forgotten me by now anyway, so it's all good. <br />
<br />
Drop me a line anytime at Jobrill@gmail.com , and I'll see you next game. Or hell, maybe even back in EQ, I've quit before.</div></div><hr />

P.S. As an FYI, you can get a computer from Dell on one of their sales that will run EQ perfectly fine very cheap. Recently they had a 2.8ghz P4, 800 FSB, CDRW, 256 ram, 40gb HD, for only $349 after rebate. Yeah, I know it's not an amazing machine, but it's dirt cheap.</div></div><hr />

Depend what you've been studying. I never had any problem to get a good job personally.<br />
<br />
If the guy is trying to get a degree in some soft science such as anthropology, psychology, history, philosophy or something else like that, well, yeah, he's basicly fucked.<br />
<br />
But anything engineering or applied sciences related is a good ticket for a decent job if you dont flat out suck when doing interviews.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Seku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I am a university professor (Marketing), teach at a top 50 school and speak 2 languages other than English. I spent 5 years teaching overseas in Asia and the students there work about 3 times as hard as American students and are interested in learning instead of mainly interested in getting a degree so they can apply for a job. Too many American students only want the paper so they have an entry certificate that allows them enough money to live the life of conspicuous consumption.<br />
<br />
It isn't really about the kind of degree you get but what you actually are able to do. Companies come to we professors all the time and discuss what they are looking for. Their biggest complaint by far is that students with degrees can not write intelligently. A university degree tells a prospective employee only 3 things: 1. You are educatable, 2. You are able to forgive current pleasures for a long period of time to achieve a goal (4 years to a degree), 3. You know the basic vocabulary of whatever the degree you have. There isn't much else and while it doesn't seem like much it is a lot compared to others.<br />
<br />
For those who may think I am an 'Ivory Tower' academic I started and grew 4 different businesses before going back to get my Ph.D. Three of them were quite successful, the other wasn't for various reasons. I sold 2 of them and gave the other away to my employees. My BS degree is in Engineering and while many jobs are headed overseas the US still rules the roost on design and innovation. American students that actually do learn are a lot better on understanding than foreign students.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Banuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">was wondering where you been, good job on getting Rl ahead of EQ.<br />
<br />
Cya round dude.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>kuulaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">A university degree tells a prospective employee only 3 things: 1. You are educatable, 2.

<br />
<br />
Something else to keep in mind is that a degree is not required to be successful.  If your able to solve problems, intelligent, and a quick study you will be much more successful than someone who lacks those characteristics yet has a degree.<br />
<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, college is good, and getting a degree shows a level of dedication to accomplishing a goal.  It is however not the end all and be all of being successful.  I know several people I went to college with that all have degrees and none of them have a career in their field of study, and many of them work the same or similar jobs they did before college.<br />
<br />
<br />
I never finished my degree.  I was studying a double major in Math and Computer Science, and had finished all but my general Education requirements in the first 2 years.  I went to school late and had a family that I needed to support.  Anyhow, I was offered several positions after my fall semester of my 3rd year in college.  I took a job as a network design engineer.  I have since left that job and currently work as a structural design engineer for a company that designs and builds concrete batch plants. <br />
<br />
<br />
By far the question I get asked the most, &quot;how do you get such good jobs without a degree?&quot;  and the answer is always the same, I have the ability to learn fast, a high IQ, and I solve problems.  It means far more to a company to have someone with those traits on their staff than to worry about what piece of paper they bring with them.<br />
<br />
A degree gets you in the door, the rest is up to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>derakolwtf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">so this got changed from a good bye thread to a pat yourself on the back thread?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Culdahl1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">so this got changed from a good bye thread to a pat yourself on the back thread?<br />
<br />
Sure looks that way.<br />
<br />
For the pat yourself on the backers - Education does mean everthing in this world, unless you happen to know someone within the company you are applying to.  Most companies have minimum requirements for education and won't even interview those that don't meet said requirement.  Also, I.Q. means little in the average job world.  What matters most in the professional world is one's ability to kiss ass, to put it bluntly.  In other words, you need to do what you're told when you're told in order to make it in a capitalistic society.  This is evident in the educational process and most evident in higher education...95% of what you learn in college is useless short of a chance appearance on jeopardy.  The other 5% is only marginally usefull and would be far better learned via OJT.  Education is merely a test of one's servitude (we can educate a monkey but it doesn't make him any more intelligent).<br />
<br />
I.Q. coupled with a &quot;follower&quot; mentallity can help you advance quicker in life, but one who truly possesses a high I.Q. would inherently not follow in the first place.  The only place I.Q. really helps is in self-employment/business ownership.  The exception to this would be those with very high I.Q.'s (top 1% of the top 1%).....these I.Q.'s typify scientists/inventors and those in the arts (great actors, writers, painters, etc.).  Side note - I dropped out of highschool my senior year and had less then a 1.5 GPA when I did so.  I went to work for a factory making about 10/hr soon after (this was about 10 years ago).  My above avg. I.Q. didn't help much on the assembly line. In fact, it made things worse because I was actually smart enough to realize how meaningless the work was and how fucked my future would be (made working hell compared to the mindless drones who were 100% content with their respective lives).  It wasn't until I decided to get my GED and, subsequently, my BSN that I actually began to enjoy what I was doing and get payed a respectable amount.  BTW, I graduated with a 4.0 and it wasn't because I worked harder or anything it was because college grades you on what you know and not what you do like highschool (drugs + hate for authority + laziness = not so good grades).<br />
<br />
P.S. - If it's money and employment you seek from college then no other major can match the medical field.  You can make 20+/hr to start from a ONE year nursing degree and you are guaranteed a job upon graduation.  There are dozens of similar degrees that pay just as well and have an equal demand (so long as the US has a positive population growth the med field will always be hiring).</div></div><hr />
