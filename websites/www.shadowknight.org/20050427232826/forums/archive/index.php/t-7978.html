<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grimy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Shadowbane got delayed another like 6 months so back to eq I came lol. When I initally left (prior to luclin release) I was hoarding gear to begin a Shadowknight, a class Ive loved forever, but never played. Now I plan on retireing all other characters and making this SK my one and only main, so I'm serious about this not just making some alt for the hell of it.    <br />
<br />
   Heres my delema, I like these three races equally, I know the pros and cons of each, Ogre, Iksar and Gnome, I'm just looking for advice on where to allocate beginning attribute points on the Ogre, I'm assuming all into sta for the other two.    Also, which God for Ogre? Is Greenmist worth the free Kael Faction from worshiping Rallos? How Hard is it to gain Kael Faction? <br />
<br />
   How useful is regen to a hybrid post 51, no fungi, just the bare bones regen the gods endowed you with, I know its not gunna save you from an_uber_mob01 but in your day to day existance.<br />
<br />
   Gnome tinkered armor that gives you effects like &quot;grease injection&quot; ... wtf do these do, how many charges if any, is it rechargeable? Useful or just toys to lug around?<br />
<br />
Thx in advance for all advice, answers and opinions! - G</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Akeikyl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I chose and stuck with Iksar after having a Ogre and Gnome SK. The  AC bonus, Regen and Forage are nice and I spent all my starting points in Sta. Also with Velious onward 99.9% of armor has no racial restriction. With Velious, Luclin and PoP the amount of non kos city's has grown ten fold. I will be able to aquire Velious quest armor shortly so being limited on kunark and prior era armor doesnt bother me at all. The only thing I wish I had was Ogre's ability to be unstunnable from the front but for me the extra AC, Regen and post Kunark era armor not being restricted made Iksar was the best choice for me. <br />
