<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Naubi</div><div class="date">01-01-2005, 07:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looking at some parses I've taken (for exp groups) it seems like the deciding factor in DPS now is other factors than the class they play. Unless they're a rogue of course.<br />
<br />
For example... I usually come top (for total damage done, not incudling DS) in my groups. I'm guessing this is because being the tank means being the first on the mob etc. Doesn't matter what the other classes are unless they are rogues.<br />
<br />
This is just for regular exp groups btw.<br />
<br />
Anyway just posting this as I find it strange.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DConquest</div><div class="date">01-01-2005, 11:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That has true for SKs for a long time, and the fact that only Rogues outdmg you is a hint as to why it is.  On paper you can draw out how every DPS caster will own you in DPS ... but Real Game Experiences &gt; Paper.  No caster is going to go for maximum efficiency 100% of your group.  On the other hand, SKs are pretty much forced to... and we regen our mana back nicely via our tap spells to keep it up. Rogues just have to make sure to be behind the mob with auto attack on and hit BS fairly consistantly to keep up good dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Josahd</div><div class="date">01-01-2005, 12:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's a few factors at work.<br />
<br />
First, a parse taken by yourself is never 100% accurate for those around you.  It's closer in an exp group (people are less likely to be out of range of your parse), but the parse can still miss things from other people.  For example, dot damage from other people is never factored in.<br />
<br />
Gear gap.  I've parsed myself at about the same damage output as a rogue appy before.... because he was using BoT daggers or something similar, and I had epic 1.5 and max worn atk.<br />
<br />
AA gap.... things like touch of the cursed, soul abrasion, etc add a lot to our sustained dps.<br />
<br />
A bit of effort in gear and aa's can make up a sizable gap in the difference between a 'dps' class and us.<br />
<br />
And finally, SK's straight up are not all that bad of dps.  We'll usually edge out warriors, always outdps paladins... depending on if we have decent mana regen, and the mob's resists, we can often knock on the door of other classes, too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sosk</div><div class="date">01-02-2005, 09:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I parse in the top five with my 2h on raids.  We do a shit load of damage now.  When tanking it gets even crazier cause we fight first and ripostle etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">window</div><div class="date">01-02-2005, 01:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">DS damage is also usually included as your damage when you're parsing yourself... and that can be pretty high. but yeah, SKs with lots of AAs can own at DPS. we have pet (40+ DPS), innate procs (25ish DPS), and 28 pts more DS than other tanks, added to our other melee/spell damage.<br />
<br />
casters are always limited by their mana regen, wizards tend to suck for exping, especially in chain pulling exp groups. if they're regenning 100 per tick, and nuking with an 8:1 efficiency, if there's no downtime they can only maintain 130ish DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Naubi</div><div class="date">01-02-2005, 02:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Defintiely right about wizards... they sorely need some boosts for exp group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Siilvir</div><div class="date">01-03-2005, 02:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Depending on what program you are using to parse, DoT's and pets are likely not included in your parses. Sounds like you might have some slackers in your group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Josahd</div><div class="date">01-03-2005, 05:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I pissed off more than one ranger in my guild by talking about my parses, lol.  Epic click adds a pretty good chunk of damage, and if you go full burn with dots and taps/spears, feigning now and then to keep aggro low, you will do quite a lot of burst damage.  Won't be able to sustain it like a real dps melee (rogue, monk, etc), but we can crank out high dps for 2-3 minute bursts pretty well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Naubi</div><div class="date">01-03-2005, 06:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We definitely outdps warriors now I would say.</div></div><hr />

Having like 1500 aa prolly helps him :P.</div></div><hr />

Well those numbers are a sample for a small EP guild (usually raid are 30ppl). I tend to believe that low numbers in raid suppose high performance for everyone as we do not have much firepower with that low number. That's why I love to parse to bother the slackers which I hate (parasites - Beastie Boys).<br />
We have a vast disparity in equipment as the guild is not homogenous. Warr1 (wasn't MT) is a 11Khp unbuffed tank with a VDD as 2hand and for someone not supposed to DPS... He does DPS quite honorably. <br />
Monks Epic 1.5 does a shitload of sustained DPS. Monkey hadn't any FA or bard with them... <br />
The rogues are vastly slacking and one already hates me when I point it out p<br />
Berzie do have a nice DPS for his old Emp Sword, he still lack some AAXP.<br />
I am pretty happy with my sustained dps on 3minutes+ long fight, my old Goldenboy though totally outdated perform well.<br />
<br />
Groups makeup and buffs have a HUGE impact on DPS but it's hard make understand to group bards with the right classes. With a low ATK toon like me, a bard singing Warsong is like 20%/30% more DPS. In a full Melee group this will cut down the time to kill mobs, increasing pace kill saves time, mana and risk etc...<br />
<br />
I dream about epic 1.5 and what my DPS score would be with it oO</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Naubi</div><div class="date">01-04-2005, 08:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess it depends what you parse on and for how long.<br />
<br />
One something ideal for a sk... like a M'Sha where we can dump our mana aggressively I out dps our warrior with aliins mace.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mriu</div><div class="date">01-08-2005, 03:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am nowhere near the best equipped SK out there.  On straight melee from behind, I put out about 190dps.  On raid mobs (where dots stick) I put out a bti more for the duration of the fight, at which time I am oom.  If I use HT it goes up a little as well, but I'm regularly on top of the food chain when it comes to damage put out, as are the rest of the SK's in guild (unless they forget to fd every now and then and get whomped of course).<br />
<br />
Kinda nice.<br />
<br />
Then there's the time I hurried to the raid, and didn't realize I had my OT hammer equipped.  Wondered where I got that 2HB skillup from...  Needless to say I wasn't at the top of that parse...<br />

<br />
Your parser is wrong no way you could do that with a GR.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mriu</div><div class="date">01-08-2005, 10:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dunno wasn't me parsing it, was a shaman in my group.<br />
<br />
Warrior we were with was averaging about 220, and the monk around 150.  <br />
<br />
I thought it was a little high, but it has been consistent.  Maybe his parser is adding damage for me?<br />
<br />
Ah ok haven't updated magelo in a while either, not using GR anymore.  Whatever that wep is from WoS, shield, and a 125 dd aug, as well as Shroud hits with SA3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Josahd</div><div class="date">01-08-2005, 11:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Straight melee I only do about 130 dps with cvoh, 165 or so with epic 1.5 on your average exp mob with maxed worn atk... 190 straight melee sounds rather high.  Throw in procs and any other DD's, maybe, parser was probably counting these as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mriu</div><div class="date">01-09-2005, 06:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I talked to the guy who wrote the parser...he had it calculating all damage from me, not just melee.  I thought it seemed a little high...<br />
<br />
Either way though, with the exception of rogues and rangers, we're up there as far as damage goes, and it's nice to be able to point that out.  Give ol boner a couple mag toys and he still can't out dps me anymore.<br />
