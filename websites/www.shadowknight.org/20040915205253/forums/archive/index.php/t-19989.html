<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>belize</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">run 3, regen 3, then it depends on how you play. <br />
<br />
if you tank for groups, get natural durability 3, combat agility 3 and combat stability 3. by this time class AA has been open for quite a while. get physical enhancement. it give extra ND, CA and CS. <br />
<br />
that is of course if you are talking about what AA do you get from zero.<br />
<br />
if you are reffering to GOD AA's then i dont know yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Pretecf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If I had it to do over again, I would surely skip run3.  Yes, I know this is counter to every post on every site I have ever seen.  But it is also the only thing that we spend points on that is not stackable.  SoW, SoE and even Jboots are readily available and all outperform run3, and overwrite it.<br />
<br />
Dex, HP and Int are the areas where I seek buffs today.  I would likely put the first level of AA points into regen and into one of these areas, if I could choose again.<br />
<br />
Since I am not normally called upon to be a main tank, my next selections were in the Fury's to increase my DPS.  Using a 2HS, my melee crits are substantial and my magic crits have proven to be quite helpful as I LDoN my way to better gear and additional AAs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I still contend that regen is effectively worthless and metabolism is the winner in General.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dester</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Skip run 3? Are you high on something? Sow or SOE is the first thing I click off when my buff bar is getting full.<br />
<br />
Run 3 doesn't stack with sow, sure, but its fast enough w/ pulling and doesn't use up a precious buff slot.<br />
<br />
With that one buff slot that I save I can buff str, dex or what ever by way more then the 6 pts I could get in any stat by spending AA to raise it.<br />
<br />
anyway...<br />
Run 3, Regen3, ToL (at least one if you are 62+) then ND, CS, CA PE, SCF3<br />
<br />
Those are the best ive found so far /shrug<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Pheyt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think i'd put my starting 6 into run 3 and metabolism 3.<br />
<br />
in fact, i did. <br />
<br />
I got run 3 for the same reason as one of the above posters, SoE/etc is the first thing to go when i run low on buff slots.<br />
<br />
Metabolism 3 is great for the cost imho.  hard to complain about saving money/inventory slots (cause you carry less) on food.  Without metabolism 3, I doubt I would be able to use fairly expensive stat food...and I am too lazy to forcefeed myself garbage all the time and swap.  At that point, one begins to view food as another &quot;inventory slot&quot; and who doesn't want another slot to gather hps/mana/stats/whatever in?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>belize</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">nod. metabolism 3 is a great AA. but stat food wasnt really any good when luclin came out. there wasnt much choice or availability. nowadays you could be right.<br />
<br />
however regen3 and even the first lvl of arch type regen are nice to counter the dot of our liche spells, or help you heal while FD. does regen save you while fighting? no, but it can help with downtimes of you solo or get dotted while soloing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Talonmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">And while its effect was negligible, I was happy for every bit of regen I had while I was kiting raid mobs around and my healer and I could not get together for a heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>lorddaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Run 3, metab 3</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>aress</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">at your level run 3, stamina 3</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Daikoku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Run/metabolism, at the time regen was good, but no sence dealing with expensive food as much.  <br />
<br />
Dai<br />
<br />
(Yes I am that lazy, I not want to force feed for anything but bbpps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>NorrynNoir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">i say run3 , regen 3 so that way pact of hate is essentially a wash because you regen back nearly what it dots you for anyway. if you're an iksar/troll maybe this doesn't matter i don't know.<br />
<br />
despite the fact that movement buffs are ubiquitous, buff slots are not. i stopped for run3 at lvl 51 and never regretted it.</div></div><hr />
