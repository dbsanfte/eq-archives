<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Therakys</div><div class="date">06-10-2002, 01:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In just got my last 2 scrolls from CoM yeeehhhaaa !!!<br />
<br />
I soloed CoM quite well being 52 with SCHW w/ AP and almost full Dreadscale except BP which is a Worked Dragonhide BP.<br />
<br />
I wondered if I could solo the jails to free Argest ( got a SoP/SBS to bash those Legates and a nerfed CoS to get there with RUN 1 ) ???<br />
<br />
I am pretty sure its doable maybe by setting camp in the small room by the Penmaster's campfire where there is one static spawn.<br />
<br />
Any ideas ?</div></div><hr />

Just  be sure to pull them far enough away to prevent any casters healing them during fight and bash any casters.  In fact using CoS you should be able to single pull the casters to the room next to pen keepers and kill them first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vistol</div><div class="date">06-10-2002, 01:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its going to be tough, real tough.<br />
<br />
I was there last night with a 60 druid and we got beat up pretty good from adds.  The mob AI casting changes makes it really deadly.<br />
<br />
However, once you have the keys from the Penmaster, the Penkeeper's spawn can be held solo.  You just have to fight at the back of the cage where he spawns so you dont get any adds, and make sure you snare him.  He spawns in the cage next to the one with the iksars.<br />
<br />
Back to the penmaster, I'd say that you should probably take a friend with you for this step.  Fighting in the hallway area to the jail seemed to work pretty well, but there are a lot of roamers when trying to break into the jail that would be tough solo.<br />
<br />
If you feel up to it, give it a shot though.  Watch out for the casters, they're a lot deadlier than they appear.  Got nuked for 341 repeatedly with 100+ magic, fire and cold resists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Therakys</div><div class="date">06-10-2002, 02:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah I forgot about the changes they made to casters. I often organised mid level raids in here but It was sometime ago.<br />
<br />
Something I just don't understand is: how comes you were nuked that much ? 341 looks a lot and even more with high resist and being 52 with greenies in here.<br />
<br />
Anyway I guess you are right, I'll bring one or 2 mates and see how things go first before attepmting any soloing.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the advices.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vistol</div><div class="date">06-10-2002, 03:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wish I knew why I got hit so bad =/  Both me and my friend were like WTF, she even got snapped for 200 a couple times too.<br />
<br />
Average nukes on me were 140-200 with the less-than-occasional 300+.. I was very ticked about this, just glad I brought her along :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Agoni</div><div class="date">06-10-2002, 04:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I spent the last weekend repairing my faction in Droga all solo.  I managed to go from amiable to high warmly again...go figure kill the royal family a time or two for the history of greenmist and they get cranky.  Anyhoo only time i get hit for 331 damage is the HT and you wont be resisting any of those.  Stalagknights, Mosstroopers and maybe one of the others Deprecators? are all SKs with HT.  As for the caster balancing it just means that they are casting spells more intelligently and still have melee level hp's ac and atk.  I do get nuked by them mostly i resist or minimize the damage the most I recall getting tagged for at one whack was bout 200pts or so and they are using nukes that I dont recall them using before.  They tash, snare, dot, nuke, fear etc.<br />
At 50+ you should have no problem getting single pulls and most of Droga is roomy enough to pull em away and whack em individually, however, if you are pulling a big train to slaughter to speed up the faction process you will perhaps encounter increased difficulty do to the caster balancing.  I just solo the way I've always done in here...that is i pull with my bow, hit my hotkey for CoS run to spot snare whack mob rinse and repeat adnauseum ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vistol</div><div class="date">06-10-2002, 04:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I didn't mention the HT's because those were the only thing that seemed normal about those greens ;)<br />
<br />
But I'm sure they weren't HTs.  I've slept since then so I'm not sure what cast them, however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Therakys</div><div class="date">06-11-2002, 06:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tested it yesterday night with a couple mates.<br />
<br />
The penmaster spot is a bit more difficult since spells seems to land hard on me. But, it is still possible to single pull in here. Just take care of Flamedrowsers and Legates cause they did full damage often with their spells. Nice to have Iksar regen and bandages in here or a shammy partner ( I don't have a fungi hehe ).<br />
<br />
The 341 DDs are HT. Yes those are HT not spells. It comes from the depredators and such.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the penkeeper spot can surely be done solo if you don't mind waiting in his jail and not puling the other mobs in the inner jails. Might be quite boring but since he doesn't drop the stone key yesterday I guess I am in for more pen killing.<br />
<br />
Thanks all for yer advices !!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darkbaine</div><div class="date">06-11-2002, 09:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I lucked out...got a full group of guildies to go with me (Thanks guys!) and the whole thing took about 2 1/2 hours. Droga solo? WHY? If yer friends won't come to help you do something cool, then who is gonna help you with the tougher stuff? Why risk nasty solo non rezzed CRs when you can have friends who show you that they are glad to help you. I'll help any one of all the people who got me as far as I have. So I say...find your friends, bring them with you, and even if there is no xp or loot...have an adventure....Its worth it.<br />
<br />
Thats just my opinion. I could be wrong.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vistol</div><div class="date">06-11-2002, 12:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, here are my main solo reasons:<br />
<br />
My friends are more casual players than I am.  They are also level 60 and busy doing other stuff, and I hate to bother then to camp small green crap like this.  Especially when it takes so long for the items you need.<br />
<br />
I camped the penkeeper a total of 13 hours before I got my key (5 sunday night, 8 yesterday) and it took that long to get the stupid stone key.  I'd hate to bring a friend along and waste their time in a boring single camp like that.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the dalnir forge eats all nodrop items if you have to hit Done because say, your invis just fell and the greens in the room are hitting you with spells.  I lost all of my items last night because of this, and waiting for a GM to even get back to me about reimbursement :\<br />
<br />
Anyway, about the nukes, it was the flamedowsers that were nuking me for the 300+ and they were NOT HTs.  Yes, there were mobs in there that HT'd for 341 but that wasn't the nukes I was talking about.  Got my but reamed by a flamedowser PH, had to HT the damn thing because it nuked so hard and fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarkWyld</div><div class="date">06-12-2002, 07:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, with the changes of NPC casters, this area has become more hazardous.  If you insist on doing this solo, you are probably better off taking time to kill the casters and healers until melees spawn in their places.  If the melees then aggro on you, FD to get them to return to their spots and/or routine.  I always hated the flamedrowsers here and in Nurga and the recent change has just made them all even more nasty.  Personally, I would definitely suggest bringing a group in to do this now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wasson</div><div class="date">06-12-2002, 09:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Taken from Casters realm as of 6-12-02<br />
<br />
NPCs that are much lower level than their target have had their potential casting damage reduced using a similar mechanic to the one that player characters' level differences use <br />
<br />
NPC Wizards no longer have an inherent bonus to their fire and cold based spells <br />
<br />
Most NPCs that had previously had their spellcasting level inflated to make up for poor spell selection have been brought back into line with their actual level <br />
<br />
If this targets Droga mobs also, this might mean it is easier to solo since the casters were revamped last time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Therakys</div><div class="date">06-13-2002, 03:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Seen the patch too and I will be trying soon and report if its doable for those who care ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Penkeeper is soloable quite easy at 52.<br />
<br />
Stay in his jail, Doom Dark and kill. Before killing him, check if there are no Legate in sight cause they will heal him and this can be anoying.<br />
<br />
His repop time is 20 min and a PH can spawn in his place.<br />
<br />
This left me sometime to get a few other mobs but those were greenies so no great xp. Take a book coz this can be a boring camp.<br />
<br />
I did not check the penmaster camp to see if it was soloable as easily I was so excited to begin the Greenmist.<br />
<br />
Have fun !</div></div><hr />
