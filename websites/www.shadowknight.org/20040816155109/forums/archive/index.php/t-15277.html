<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Caktis1981</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okie today I was working on the 9th coldain ring quest, the portion of the quest where you turn in &quot;Tainted Mountain Ale&quot; or something like that too Captain Berradin. I had a friend do combine and turn-in for me. Took a while but Berradin convulsed and dropped like was supposed too. But I thought I read that he despawns, then re-pops, then falls down. I figured I musta read wrong an told ranger too start harmonying the mobs. He got too about the 3rd harmony and Berradin despawned. I thought maybe this is part where he respawns... but he didnt. So little while later after killing all bodyguards twice over I figured I was screwed, but he spawned again.. but musta just been normal mob respawn timer because he was standing and did not drop any loot. My question is this... Did I mess up the quest somehow? Is the MQ of the &quot;Tainted Ale&quot; not possible? Since this was a MQ would re-imbersement of the Ale be denyed? Havnt been able to get hold of GM but if anyone knows that I did something wrong here I wont waist the time of a GM. Any and all info much appreciated, thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Saruton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">He does despawn and respawn in the splitsecond he drops to the ground. You should have attacked him when he was on the ground. Go and get another Ale a GM wont do shit to help you here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Warmaster Xsavuung Llaahh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just pull him. I don't think the others add anyway. Even if they do, just FD them off or have your ranger friend aggro them and you kill the choking dorf.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Talonmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">MQ is possible.  I did it myself 2 weeks ago.  Once you do the turn in he will choke... then some time later he will choke again and fall to the ground.  Entire process took about 2 min or so.  As soon as he hits the ground, wack and pull.  Nothing will assist.</div></div><hr />
