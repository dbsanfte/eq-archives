<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Reign</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just started with my Dark Elf SK and I'm looking forward to the challenge. I know you guys are probably tired of SK newbies asking for advice but any tips that you may have would be greatly appreciated. Most specificaly concerning the &quot;Hide&quot; skill.<br />
<br />
      My main is a lvl44 Bst which has a sneak ability but I never saw any use for it so I never trained at it and so far my SK is now lvl7 and still have no used the hide ability.<br />
<br />
      How important is the hide ability and how do you use it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>dragoon of darkness</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">hide really isnt animportant skill but it has it's uses.<br />
<br />
the downside is that if you hide, your pet automaticaly dies. I use it forifim in a zone and have to go afk for about a min ill just sit and hide, just to be on the safe side. basically hide is just an instant invis that is brken when you move, cast a spell, or anything like that. you dont need to train it...just useit when it serves a purpose...i have it on a hot button but i rarely use it<br />
<br />
DoD</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Requiam O'Souls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The thing wih Hide is it's not an automatic success, which throws alot of people off. Find a mob you know does not see invis, or beginning indifferent faction, keep it targetted. <br />
<br />
Next use your hide skill, con it. If you went from anything to indifferent, then it worked. If not, click skill off and try again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nyrvel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I use Hide to keep 'Greens' from whacking me when I'm memorizing spells or I'm in an unknown zone and I want to check things out first. On one adventure I succesfully hid when someone zoned with a train, they hung around (me sweating) and then wandered away. Personally (of course), I think Hide rules (at least until the day comes when I can serve steaming hot platters of 'Here's your ass' instead of receiving them :) ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jupke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hide is a great skill to have when medding in dangerous spots when the mobs dont see invis.<br />
<br />
I used hide all the time when medding in Kata between the guards, the advantage is it doesn't break untill you move.<br />
<br />
Just be sure to con a mob to see if you are invis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Loravna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hide can also be used to complete some quests with faction lower than was originally intended. If indifferent is sufficient faction for the quest then Hide will let you do the quest with faction as low as dubious. Simply give the item(s) in question to the NPC, but don't finish the transaction. While the trade window is open use the Hide skill. Be sure to con the NPC to make sure the Hide was successful; if it was finish the transaction. I used this trick in Paineel to do the Kobold Molar quest at dubious faction even though you normally need apprehensive for the quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>GenoReaper999</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i maxed out my hide at 75, so i was a little dissappointed it didnt go higher.  i usually invis and hide to med.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zakton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hide is a great skill to keep from getting attacked while you are medding out in the middle of a zone.  Also its great fun to use hide with a noob player.  Freaks them out to have you disappear and if you do it right you can make them think you are moving around like a rogue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Reign</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanx for your suggestions and any other tips would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />
