<br />
I mean, I worship Innoruuk, as a Human I'd like to think that I'm slightly less... fanatical than a Dark Elf. Still, in a guild with about 30% paladins, I'd rather not RP if its going to effect in-game friendships. Thinking about it from a RPing standpoint, I'm more of a Paladin anyhoo. <br />
<br />
Any ideas? Let me know if you need clarification and I'll try to explain myself better. *sighs* That'll involve sleeping for more than 5 hours I think...</div></div><hr />

You don't need friends.  Or better yet, act like a friend, then get them all killed while you FD and laugh at them from deep down inside.<br />
<br />
Seriously, over the course of 2 years of playing, my attitude has changed a bit.  I think now that it's best to act mature, aloof, and with honor.  Show that SKs have class.  Be slightly mysterious, and let your blade do the talking.  Just my 2cp.</div></div><hr />

The kind of guy that makes you feel you have judged the intentions of the Teir'dal wrong..   kind of guy that is reserved, respectful if not warm..    the kind of guy who will have you dead the first time you prove yourself to not be of use to his goals and that of his order..  and would sacrifice a &quot;friend&quot; if it placed him in a better position.<br />

It's just a different type of honor than those of wimpy paladins or clerics.  :)<br />
<br />
By no means are we scoundrels (leave that to the rogues); our trust and respect is earned by that which is evil, cold, and calculating.  We are merciless, and have no pity for the weak or the feeble (much like Rallos Zek worshippers).  We realize that for evil to truly prosper, there must be order, and our society reflects that.  Iksar, Erudites, and Dark Elves should especially adhere to the structure.<br />
<br />
We are supposed to be the most lethal of all kinds of evil : sadistic, organized, unforgiving.   A method to all of our madness.  And I love it.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Moonnyt</div><div class="date">04-02-2002, 06:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I first started my SK almost One year and a half ago I picked a human for Roleplaying reasons. I had a blast  , I would send young Paladin's and Ranger's on bogus Quests into the Bloodsaber guild below Qeynos. &quot;follow the trail of bones , and hand this patch of gnoll fur to  Sragg Bloodheart . I have a great reward for you if you do this&quot;  Well, a RL friend of mine who got me into EQ told me I could get in trouble for this ... so I stopped. Now when I roleplay, it's more of a quite and proud dark knight. Not spreading evil ... because of a &quot;play nice&quot; policy :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jobrill</div><div class="date">04-02-2002, 06:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm definitely a fan of Shadowknights as Orderly Evil, Chivalrous as any Lancelot, just with a different code of chivalry. Dedication in the extreme to the chosen God, with a bit of a missionary tint, and a self-assured belief in the innate superiority of said God and the cause of &quot;Evil&quot; in general. With an Erudite, it might be adherence to the Dark truth and the belief that no stone must go unturned in the search for knowledge, even into the realms of pain and death and necromancy. With an Ogre (Rallos Zek Worshipper), it might be the belief in the purifying power of conflict and war, and that the only people who deserve to draw breath are those who can fight for it, and reclaim it. If you are worthy, you will be able to fight off any challenger, and so on and so forth with the other races. <br />
<br />
EQ isn't always open to RP, ESPECIALLY the evil kind, but with a bit of tact and some smart turns of phrase, except for someone who's incredibly uptight, you should be able to coexist peacefully with non-RPers.</div></div><hr />

Im from a city with a huge background to be evil on. I just RP that since Old Paineel was destroyed and both my Necro parents were slaughtered, I never finished learning all the spells from my parents. (Thats why I dont have spells etc at same time as my necro counterparts.) I learnt the way of the sword from the skeleton guards (whom are actually dead Barbarians, Trolls and Ogre Warriors that died) As I summoned pets I made them teach me how to defend myself..now I control these same piles of bones as pets..and am part Necro (but not as good, cause I didnt learn everything) ..and part warrior(but not as good cause I actually learnt from warriors that died in combat). And since Eruds are more intelligent ..Im more necro, as were my parents.<br />

Just play with what Verant gave you.You can work something out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zemi</div><div class="date">04-02-2002, 07:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You are a knight of your realm.  You're supposed to be one of the elite of your kind, be it troll, dark elf or *shudders* gnome.<br />
<br />
From there you can take on a few ways.  Be like Dragoon Xytl in West Commons, and kill everything in your path.  Or take a more thoughtly approach like Lharac, and wait for someone dumb enough to do your bidding :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anarcia</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 10:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, maybe there is another way to look at the roleplaying aspect of this.  Who in the entertainment world (fiction) would be a shadow knight?  I am not talking about actual spells and abilities, but whom do you think would portray the &quot;ESSENCE&quot; of being Shadow Knight?<br />
<br />
I nominate the villian from the movie THE CROW, whose name escapes me at the moment.<br />
<br />
Reasons:  He is evil through and through with little regard to human life, but loyal to those that he befriends...as long as they don't cross him.  He seeks power, control and wealth, but is not running around just killing anyone.  If you stand in his way - well then, hey, you are fair game.  He is not a coward - sending others to do his bidding.  He just send others to do his fighting when the adversary is beneath him.<br />
<br />
In EQ - I think a Shadow Knight would be an underworld figure.  He would befriend, even help good races, in an effort to convince them that he is actually quite the nice fellow.  Behind that friendly smile is a heart of ice however.  By underworld, I mean that to the general public, he is a pillar of the community, nice to dogs, kisses babies, and donates to the church.  But under the shroud of secrecy, a cloak of darkness - he works his evil ways.  He is the chess master - and all else - even his closest allies are just pawns.<br />
<br />
He would group in EQ with anyone, as they too are just pawns to further his wealth.  He would be friendly, cordial even to them.  Hatred does not mean stupidity.  Hatred is not cutting off your nose to spite your face.  It is working with others and twisting them to your own evil designs.<br />
<br />
A Paladin would see someone in trouble and run to their aid.  A Shadowknight would see someone in trouble and decide if that person was of any use to them.  If not, he would sit and watch him die, just because watching him die would be well - for lack of better words - WAY COOL!<br />
<br />
A Shadow Knight knows that he cannot make it in the world alone, but forming a bevy of Lackies would help his cause.<br />
<br />
Morgana La Fay would be a Shadow Knight.  Creating an entire army just to further her evil designs.  Even to the point of mothering a child from her own enemy.  Her desire for wealth, revenge and power would be all-encompassing.  REVENGE is surpreme here.  <br />
<br />
In EQ Terms - no death to the shadow knight would be left unpunished.  If a young SK accidently took on a guard, and died, (a blunder we have all done) a SK would not be stupid enough to kill the guard herself.  She would however, hire someone to do the deed, and stand by and watch her revenge be extracted.<br />
<br />
In EQ Terms - you have to live by Terms of Service.  You can't train things to zone, etc.  But a Shadow Knight would never do that.  That is petty and small.  Being Evil does not mean you are an idiot.  Being evil means you know how to manipulate, and control others.  They are, after all, only worthy as boot-lickers.<br />
<br />
That to me is the goal of my Shadow Knight.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nephtu</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 01:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's a big difference between beong evil and being a jerk.  One complication is that there are so few ..ahem... role models of anything very shadowknightish for us in the works of fantasy.  Ask yourself what motivates your character?  Religious zeal?  Racial hatred?  An obsession with real or imagined wrongs or slights?  Plain old wickedness?  They all provide different flavours.<br />
<br />
Of course, the difference between us and Paladins (other than their sucky assortment of mid-level weapons and general dweebishness - poor shmucks) is the color of hat - we're black hats, they're white hats.  We all go out,  hit monsters over the head and take their stuff for a living.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zobek</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 01:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The way I see it is not unlike in &quot;The Paladin of the Night&quot; by Weis and Hickman.  We, all evils, are a society of our own in which we thrive in happy communion.  Our goal?  To please our god and in the process, ourselves.  <br />
<br />
All outsiders are not to be trusted unless our god tells us otherwise.  We defend our own to the death.  Shadow Knights are the Hand of the god on earth, and we live by a code.  We enforce his will, but do not betray our own.  We spawn hate and fear where we tread, which makes our god stronger.<br />
<br />
I do not RP in EQ simplely because it is too easy to say or do something that is taken the wrong way or out of context (cannot &quot;read&quot; inflections, stresses, or sarcasim) by those around you, resulting in a GM slapping you with a warning or worse.<br />
<br />
I have been in RP guilds before, but those didn't work because you couldn't do anything without being &quot;summoned&quot; by your superiors for a chat.  The last one I was in they demoted me to trial member because I told my superior I was in the middle of dungeon in a group and couldn't come chat.  It was too restrictive for my play style, so I left.<br />
<br />
For me, I do my own thing.  I RP vs the environment because to do it with players causes too much crap to happen.  <br />

<br />
Shadow Knight = asshole<br />
<br />
to RP an SK you have to be just that.. and most of us don't have to try hard. hehe<br />
<br />
In game, the SK is a bully for starters. Should be very self centered and short tempered. The rude factor is your discretion, the better you are at PvP the more rude you can be I guess since a typical RP SK will always be dueling alot.  If your looking for a mind set to draw from when roleplaying think: bully,ego,temper... that should about do it.<br />
<br />
Also:<br />
<br />
1) When dueling if the player says &quot;no HT ok?&quot;  always agree to that then do it anyway!  Your an SK for christ sakes, we play by our own set of rules.<br />
<br />
2) SKs do not /hug /dance /cheer none of that momma's boy crap.. your a harbinger of death not a faeire prince. emotes you use are /stare /snarl /duel /rude /bye  thats it.</div></div><hr />

Like all Easter I talked about going to East wastes and butchering snow bunnies . . . my groups wouldnt stop laughing but I was serious . . . and make fun of Paladins whenever you get the chance . . . like in an Army of Darkness kinda way &quot;goody little TWO shoes, goody little TWO shoes&quot; . . . its really alot of fun pretending (or being) as demented as you can possibly imagine . . . and people really just think you are being goofy alot of the time and love you for it . . . . I like to make sure I say 2 &quot;wrong&quot; things for every &quot;right&quot; thing I say . . . but that is just me ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dreorg</div><div class="date">04-04-2002, 02:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it depends partially on what race/religion combo you are, as well.<br />
<br />
For example, an Iksar could choose to portray himself as a last bastion of honour in a decaying society, trying to live up to the ideals of the past.  As such, everyone else non-Iksar is beneath notice and anyone else Iksar is to be judged harshly as to whether they uphold the ideals of the past.<br />
<br />
I enjoy roleplaying - a lot.  I do LARPs and play D&amp;D, Werewolf, etc., frequently.  But I don't usually RP in EQ in such a way that could make the game not be fun for people who choose not to RP, and I try to interact with other PCs as players, not as characters.  When I do choose to RP, I try to keep it personal, or to only RP with others who enjoy it, or don't mind if I do.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hrendra An'ei</div><div class="date">04-04-2002, 03:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oooh, roleplaying..<br />
<br />
Although I'm too chatty to be *too* focused on roleplaying, I always envisioned Hrendra as more of a bitter loner than anything else. <br />
<br />
To me, it's more a matter of what one values. Hrendra values strength over weakness; she admires strength, independence, and order. She is contemptuous of the weak, the sniveling, and those who cannot defend themselves *or* lack the impetus to try.  Who are those that deserve to live? Those who earn it--and that garners her respect.  <br />
<br />
She's loyal to those who have proven their strength in battle with her; regardless of philosophical beliefs, they've earned their existence, she feels. <br />
<br />
Yet, at the same time, one of my favorite moments was when I was helping a friend (hey, Taelnia!) with her Soulfiend Lance quest, as much as I could, in Stonebrunt.  The spirit of Ridossan the Unliving manifested, and ran towards the Kejekan city--only to run into myself and a handful of my guildmates there, a motley collection of rangers and druids. Well, Ridossan apparently didn't want vengeance on the Kejekans as much as he wanted to punish my guildmates, and proceeded to drop one of them like a fly and chase the others to the zone line. <br />
<br />
I'd warned them to clear out of the area..and they didn't..and there was no way Hrendra was going to interfere with the decision of one of her Shadow Knight idols. :)  Instead, she merely watched them die...<br />
<br />
My guildmates understood, and we all had a good laugh about it afterwards, but at that moment, I was possibly closer to being evil than I'd ever been :)<br />
<br />
Paineel isn't based on chaotic &quot;kill everything and be an ass&quot;..to me, it's based on law and communal desire to explore knowledge at any cost--and over the centuries, it's become a subtle current throughout the society that those who are unwilling to embrace the darker side are fooling themselves, and are indeed lesser..<br />
<br />
and weak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Efugia</div><div class="date">04-04-2002, 06:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I play my shadowknight as a pretty typical individual who was drawn to bertoxxulous through fate.  Bertoxx has a hold on efugia's soul, and amplifies all of the more base aspects of her personality.  He instills a bloodlust in her, and shows her the beauty of pain, decay, and suffering.<br />
<br />
She has a strong sense of duty and honor;  will not lie, steal, or cheat.  She simply has a twisted view of reality.  Through disease and death, redemption is found.  Spreading them arouses a dark-thrill she is ashamed of, but cannot squelch.<br />
<br />
She is not a lost soul, but a kept one.  If the opportunity and freedom arose, she would destroy bertoxxulous - and all of her own powers in the process.<br />

<br />
edit:  I guess what I'm trying to say here is, figure out how you want to play your character, and then go from there.  There is no recipe, make the story your own &amp; screw the standards.  Be creative, and realise there could be a reason behind everything.</div></div><hr />
