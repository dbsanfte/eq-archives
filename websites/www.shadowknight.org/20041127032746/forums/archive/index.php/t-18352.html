<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Slithern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi folks!  New SK here looking for advice on where I might go to solo my 22 Iksar.  Any advice you can offer would be most appreciated!!  <br />
<br />
Have a good day :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Maranthus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Padula Caverns is generally a good choice :)<br />
<br />
Tslannesta</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>yuggoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Why do people have so much trouble with that name<br />
<br />
<br />
Say it with me... Paludal Caverns<br />
<br />
Dunno how many times I have been asked to lend a hand and its taken 10 minutes to figure out which zone they were talking about :b</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ramgar SK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Just say PC.  :)<br />
<br />
Other options are Kurn's Tower (basement), Upper Guk, SolA, Unrest, Runny eye.<br />
<br />
Also, Check out the sticky at the top of this forum.  The ones I listed have a good exp bonus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Slithern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the help and I apologize for not seeing the &quot;sticky&quot; thread at the top.<br />
<br />
Have a good day!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>yuggoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">As an old school Iksar SK, I hunted at 22 at the giant fort in Warsliks Woods, as well as in Lake of Ill Omen near rhe windmill.  South Karanas is good too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>kassdax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I was in East Karana at these levels. Spiders will be tough but doable. XP isn't that fantastic but you can sell the silks for a pretty penny as well making this a decent place to hunt.  <br />
<br />
You will get adds from the eyes and some of the animals so be careful to not get too many mobs at once. The evil eyes will clean your clock unless you have good magic resistance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gaklaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Highkeep guards are good fearkite..in a few lvls try lizzies in feerott they have crap hp. mow em down on my bstlord and if you can get some sort of good pathing goin you could do fear kiting. adds are kinda hard to avoid tho.</div></div><hr />
