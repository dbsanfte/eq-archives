<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello everyone. I'm taking a small break from my 56 shaman to work on a melee alt. I decided on an SK for tankability and utility and also for the evil aspect of it. I've been impressed with some SK tanks in PoP zones and prefer them over warriors -- they can hold aggro very well after a turgurs. I choose iksar for the regen and looks(I love the non-luclin models) but I'm really alarmed at how often I get stunned. So far my SK is 10th lvl and in the FoB pit I'd estimate I get stunned every 1 in 5 hits. Get two mobs on me and I'm constantly getting stunned. <br />
<br />
Well I must say this has me worried. Does it get any better as I level? I've so far avoided grouping but will start doing so soon and I dread the thought of being stunned so often. Hehe no turgurs to slow mobs down to a crawl at this level.<br />
<br />
Please tell me the amount of stunning gets less as I level up. It really makes me tempted to start over as an Ogre :)<br />
<br />
Thanks much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Skurrge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I noticed this too and it seems to even out considerably as you level and your dodge and parry goes up.    You're not going to get to a point to where you never get stunned or anything like that, but you'll get it about once per fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Akeikyl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Max your spell skills out too. I maxxed all my spells skills out and I can channel through some pretty heavy attacks easily and fizzle less. Evocation will be a real bitch, I went and dumped 30 points in it when i got it. As the other poster said as your other skills come up in lvl things will get considerably better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lizarde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You get stunned more often at lower levels, I find.  Plus, if you're fighting a lot of skeletons, they seem to bash and stun a lot more than other mobs.<br />
<br />
At level 52, I don't get stunned often when tanking, certainly not enough to keep me from doing damage and holding aggro.<br />
<br />
Heck, my level 28 alt Iksar SK doesn't seem to get stunned much anymore either, even though he tanks most of the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lunaticfringesk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The timing of this post is almost scary, as I was going to post a comment along these same lines.<br />
<br />
One of the aa options I wish that VI would put on their radar screen is for non-ogre races to obtain the ability to not be stunned from the front.  I have gotten so frustrated over being stunned (yes, from the front) while fighting, pulling, etc. so many times I literally wish I started an orge for almost that reason alone.  I will immediately challenge anyone who discounts this ability.  It is a very nice ability to have, no question about it.<br />
<br />
Also, I am highly skeptical of the idea that being stunned is reduced as you level.  While I havent performed a statistical analysis, I can assure you that my experience has been that the rate at which you get stunned at higher levels does not significantly differ from lower levels.<br />
<br />
In any case, I honestly think the rate of getting stunned is way too high.  If that is VI's way of making an encounter harder, they really should look into changing it.  Reduce the rate of being stunned and add something else to make it harder, because the rate is just way too high at the moment, it annoys me to no end and reduces my enjoyment from the game.<br />

Im not sure I understand this comment.  As a matter of fact, most of the entire comment is confusing to me.<br />
<br />
Why would you be fighting more mobs at a lower level than at a higher level?  Couldnt extras be mezzed at a lower level too?  Fights last significantly longer at a lower level than a higher level?  Sorry, but none of that makes any sense to me.<br />
<br />
In any case, however, I do not believe in the slightest that getting stunned is significantly reduced at a higher level.  As a matter of fact, I think I get stunned more now and I did before.  Perhaps this is VI's way of making encounters harder?  Hmmm...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Aaoogaa Soulhunter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Here let me make it a little clearer for you.  My quote Any mob that bashes has a certain chance to stun you. Its true you usually get stunned less at higher levels because you are fighting fewer mobs at once or the extras are mezzed.

<br />
The gear avaliable to twinks/alts allow a lower level character (1-40) to stay in the fight longer against multiple opponents.  Pull 3 blue mobs alone when your level 60 and see how long the fight lasts.  Pull three blue mobs when your level 20 and see how long the fight lasts.  Crowd control is a waste of time when the mobs are not a threat to you.  It only means something when those adds kick the shit out of you.<br />
<br />
Any mob that bashes has a certain chance to stun you. <br />
Got that.<br />
<br />
Its true you usually get stunned less at higher levels because you are fighting fewer mobs at once or the extras are mezzed.  <br />
I generally am only able to fight one blue mob at a time solo because more would kill me pretty damn quick (multiple blue mobs solo 50+ is a fast fight)...guess I am not as skilled as you.  In a group we still usually single pull and the fight is over pretty damn quick (average fight is 45 seconds on my parser).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
At lower levels, with the equipment that people have access to, the fights last longer, and the more foes you have the more chances of being stunned <br />
At lower levels I had no problem soloing 3 blue foes at once.  The fights generally lasted longer but the gear I had made it very easy to stay in the fight.<br />
<br />
Now...<br />
<br />
Why would you be fighting more mobs at a lower level than at a higher level?  Because you can.<br />
<br />
Couldnt extras be mezzed at a lower level too?  Yes but usually an ALT is twinked (maybe even buffed) and soloing.  While soloing I bet he is fighting multiple mobs...this is why he is getting stunned so much.  (Lower level crowd control (1-40) is really not that important when grouped.)<br />
<br />
Fights last significantly longer at a lower level than a higher level?  Yes (barring boss mob areas) they do.  I have yet to live very long against 3 blue mobs while solo at level 56 (being FD does not count towards fight time and neither does running to the zone).  I had no problem fighting solo against 3 blue mobs at levels 20-40.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry--this makes little sense.  If an SK could do nice damage via an AoE or something, like a druid or a wizard (i.e. quad kiting), then yeah, pulling multiples might make sense.  Since SKs cant do that, I fail to think of a single reason why anyone playing an SK would intentionally want to pull &gt; 1 solo (mob shortage perhaps?  hell--I dont know), as it wouldnt nearly be the most efficient way to xp at all.  I guess if that is an ego stroke for you, you go right ahead...<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;While soloing I bet he is fighting multiple mobs...this is why he is getting stunned so much. &quot;<br />
<br />
I can assure you that at 65 in PoV or PoS, you get to fighting / tanking multiple mobs at once, you will get stunned quite consistently as an IKS SK.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Fights last significantly longer at a lower level than a higher level? Yes (barring boss mob areas) they do. I have yet to live very long against 3 blue mobs while solo at level 56 (being FD does not count towards fight time and neither does running to the zone). I had no problem fighting solo against 3 blue mobs at levels 20-40.&quot;<br />
<br />
On a per mob basis, &quot;fights&quot; (not sure how you are defining fight, but...) do not last significantly shorter or longer at 30 then they do at 65, all things being equal.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Lunatik, Just make a fucking Ogre already. &quot;<br />
<br />
If it was easy to make a Sir, level 65 ogre SK, and equip him with the gear I presently have (or Manslayer's gear will work just fine too), I wouldve already done it by now wise ass.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Me? I get stunned every once in a while. You know what? I deal with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Come back when you are 65, playing MT in PoV, and see if you are singing the same tune.  The game is vastly different at 45 than at 65.  I have been keenly observing just how many times I get stunned in PoV lately.  I average anywhere between 3 to 5 stuns PER MOB that I am tanking.  Sorry, but that is wholly unreasonable to me and frustrating to no end.<br />
<br />
VI needs to do something about it.  Its a problem.  Im not sure if the other small races experience the same stun woes that I do, but I can assure you that my IKS SK get stunned far too often for what I would call reasonable.  For the sake of comparison, these observations are with maxed out AGI, DEX, all of our skills (i.e. dodge) and an ac of 1400+.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Aaoogaa Soulhunter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">So your talking about level 65 play and I am talking about a level 10 character.  You want to compare the two?  I was replying to the original poster not you.  I stated a low level twink can mow through mobs so its a waste of time to only pull one.  As I stated and then you argued against me with the same point that at high levels stuns are more apt to happen with multiple mobs and those mobs will kick the shit out of you really fast if your solo (making for one fucking short fight compared to soloing multiple mobs at low level).  Solo people get stunned less at high level BECAUSE they are usually only fighting one mob while at low level you are usually fighting multiple mobs ( Once again IF YOUR A TWINK).<br />
<br />
Point one - at low levels you can fight more mobs than one at a time SOLO with ease.<br />
<br />
Point two - You cannot fight multiple blue mobs at high level with ease if you are solo.  (As a matter of fact they kick the shit out of you in about 5 seconds.)<br />
<br />
Point three - A low level fight versus 3 mobs solo last longer than 5 seconds.<br />
<br />
Point four - Multiple high level mobs when you solo will kill you REALLY fast.<br />
<br />
Point five - Multiple mobs on you at any level increase the frequency of you being stunned.<br />
<br />
Point six - I was replying to the original low level poster not you.<br />
<br />
Point seven - At level 65 stun immunity is &gt; than iksar regen.  Considering you can get the ogre with almost like regen through AA use and items without the increased exp penelty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Lunaticfringesk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">&quot;Point one - at low levels you can fight more mobs than one at a time SOLO with ease&quot;<br />
<br />
Reply one:  You can also mow them down one by one with ease too.  The original poster asked if getting stunned gets &quot;any better as I level,&quot; makes reference to getting stunned with one or more mobs on him, and expressed concern over it.  That sure as hell sounds like he wants to know in general if you get the crap stunned out of you at higher levels too, which is exactly what I am referring too.  The fact that you can pull multiple mobs at low level with ease is irrelevant.  Of course fighting more mobs increases the chance of getting stunned.  That would be a true statement at any level, 65 included.  The fact that you can survive one fight and probably not the other has absolutely nothing to do with it. <br />
<br />
Im not sure how you play a twinked alt, but I can tell you that I sure as hell wouldnt recommend pulling multiples at once, even for a twink.  Even if it is low risk, why would you do that anyways?  Why not run and kill the first mob you see and move on?  Less stuns, less risk, and, most importantly, more efficient.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Point two - You cannot fight multiple blue mobs at high level with ease if you are solo. (As a matter of fact they kick the shit out of you in about 5 seconds.)&quot;<br />
<br />
Reply two:  See comment above.  This is irrelevant.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Point three - A low level fight versus 3 mobs solo last longer than 5 seconds.&quot;<br />
<br />
Reply 3:  A high level fight versus 1 mob solo lasts longer than 5 seconds...  So what...<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Point four - Multiple high level mobs when you solo will kill you REALLY fast.&quot;<br />
<br />
Reply 4:  Multiple low level mobs when you solo will not give you good xp....so what again...<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Point five - Multiple mobs on you at any level increase the frequency of you being stunned.&quot;<br />
<br />
Reply 5:  Yes.  Agree.  See comment above.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Point six - I was replying to the original low level poster not you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Reply 6:  Yeah, I suppose when you said, &quot;Here let me make it a little clearer for you,&quot; you were obviously talking to Solariis, the original poster.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Point seven - At level 65 stun immunity is &gt; than iksar regen&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Not sure.  Im sure that many would argue that point.  I dont know if I will though, as getting stunned is getting really old, really fast.<br />
<br />
<br />
Several people on this thread have laid claim to the fact that you get stunned less at higher levels, which I highly question.  As a matter of fact, I think I get stunned now moreso that I did at level 20, 30, 40 or whatever.  I am merely rebutting these claims, because I doubt the veracity of such conclusions.<br />
<br />
Why so people insist on being jerks / being rude on these boards is beyond me......  /boggle<br />

Even at my level I cant run through the pit without picking up a million scorps and skeles.<br />
<br />
Lots of mobs beating and bashing you from all directions will make for a lot of stuns.</div></div><hr />

With lower lvl alts you just buff up with druid toss the fungi on a pull the whole damn camp. As long as you have attacked and done some damage to all the mobs you'll get exp on all of them even if they die from DS. You pull multiple mobs because there is no need to split them you can and will survive the fight do to your gear. I like having multiple mobs attack me at lower lvl's because it's more chances for skill increases when you have a bunch of mobs hitting you instead of just one. So what if I'm getting stunned right and left defense, offense, dodge, parry, etc are all coming up and staying up with my levels. Thats what's most important keepings your skills at or close to your lvl max.</div></div><hr />

Stop being an idiot.<br />
<br />
Of course you get stunned less at higher levels.  Your gear is better, adding to stats, which in turn affects your AC and usually your Agi/other stats.  I'm pretty convinced that AGI has something to do with how often a mob misses you completely, as we all know that AC is only useful for damage MITIGATION (IE: taking less damage on a successful hit).  <br />
<br />
What is more, your dodge, parry and repost skills are higher.<br />
<br />
Most RPG battle calculations go something like the following:<br />
<br />
(Enemy ATK rating + Random chance to hit at base avoidance) - (Any and All increases from base avoidance of player character) = Did they hit you or not?<br />
<br />
After the game knows whether or not you've been hit, it calculates the damage based on the power of the weapon, the type of attack, the proficiency of the enemy at that type of attack and your armor and other mitigation.<br />
<br />
In addition to this calculation, in EQ there is a seperate roll on whether or not a bash/slam/kick type attack will stun you.  But essentially, the mob has to HIT you with a bash/slam/kick in order to stun you.<br />
<br />
If it isn't obvious to you by now that the higher you level the less often you will get stunned, not including those mobs who flurry/frenzy/have an inordinately fast attack, then you can just take MY word for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Lizarde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Originally posted by Lunaticfringesk <br />
I will immediately challenge anyone who discounts this ability.  It is a very nice ability to have, no question about it. <br />
I would never 'discount' the ability, any extra ability you have is something good to have.  I just think it is overrated, I think people give it too much weight when considering a race to play.<br />
<br />
I never parsed it, but I am pretty sure that you get stunned less as you level up.  I definitely noticed it with my alt SK, who got stunned pretty frequently at lower levels, but seems to get stunned a lot less at level 30, unless I'm facing two or three mobs at once.  And my 52 SK gets stunned very infrequently when he is tanking.  Maybe once or twice per fight, if that.<br />
<br />
It is a nice ability to have, no doubt about it.  But it just doesn't amount to a whole lot as you level up.  Much like the Iksar/Troll regen advantage.  It is huge at low levels, but the significance decreases as you level up.  Then again, while I would not make regen my only consideration in choosing an SK race, I would consider it to be of more use than the ability to avoid stuns from the front.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">/agree, Lizarde<br />
<br />
At lvl 20 and below, Troll regen was a definite life saver for me when fighting in an area with disease attack mobs (think Phlargs in PC, zombies and mummies everywhere).  Spreading Crud would kill other players who couldn't get it healed, but all it did was knock out my regen as a Troll.  Now, Regen doesn't even significantly reduce downtime, as I simply have so many more hp to get back.  Immunity to stun from the front would have been nice when I was running around befallen getting the shit litterally kicked out of me by interupting skellies, but now it would be almost useless.  I just almost never get stunned.  <br />
<br />
Actually, I went to PL a shammy friend the other night at the Grimling mines in Tenebrous.  I was SHOCKED when those stupid greenie/light blue Geomancers actually stunned me.  Granted it was with a spell, and spell stuns go through regardless of immunity or not, but I simply haven't fought against that many mobs that cast a stun spell, especially not in the last 15-20 lvls.<br />
<br />
IMO, race selection is 90% asthetics, 5% starting stats/abilities, and 5% equipment availability.<br />
<br />
It may make your life hell at lower levels when you get stunned every 2 hits, but you'll grow out of it, and it is such a quick path to higher levels that you'll have forgotten about getting stunned within a month or two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Lunaticfringesk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">&quot;You pull multiple mobs because there is no need to split them you can and will survive the fight do to your gear&quot;<br />
<br />
If you see 5 mobs and you could take them one by one, why would you pull all 5 at once?  Why not stomp them one at a time?  Because of DS?  Yeah, perhaps, I might be able to see that point.  You are still going to suffer some inefficiencies regardless though.  SKs dont ae well at all.  You pretty much are going to have to focus your attention on one mob at a time.  That means that the damage that you are taking from all the other mobs goes uncontested (save for the DS) and you are going to have to sit to get your health back to full (or whereever you feel comfortable) longer.  So, while you gain the advantage of doing damage to multiple mobs at once, your HP, in theory, is decreasing at 5 times the rate.<br />
<br />
So the question remains--why go out and pull 5 back to your pull spot?  If you are that dominate in a zone, why not just run around destroying everything you see?  That is exactly what myself and many of my friends do and did.  Not saying that it is the only way to do it, but that it is quite effective.  Now, why would I say this?  Because the poster who originally posted this sentiment suggested that if you are a low level twink, that was the strategy to do.  My point, I dont think so.<br />
<br />

<br />
Oh really?  Then please explain to me why is it that myself, and several other friends (non-ogre of course) now included, are getting stunned anywhere from 2 to 5 times PER MOB at level 65?  Boy, it sure does seem that many on this thread arent getting stunned at levels much lower than 65...<br />
<br />
Oh, could it be that the mobs have gotten better as has our gear?  <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;If it isn't obvious to you by now that the higher you level the less often you will get stunned, not including those mobs who flurry/frenzy/have an inordinately fast attack, then you can just take MY word for it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your arrogance is about as alarming as your ignorance.  Take MY word for it.  You can easily get stunned far more often at high levels, 65 included, than you can at lower levels.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I would never 'discount' the ability [to not get stunned from the front], any extra ability you have is something good to have. I just think it is overrated, I think people give it too much weight when considering a race to play.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
I cant form any conclusion as to if people put too much weight into that ability or not.  I can tell you, however, that I believe that it is an underrated ability, probably due to all the downplay it gets from all the races that dont have it.  I cant tell you how many times that being stunned from the front and not being able to cast FD has cost me, &quot;LOADING...PLEASE WAIT&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
And in regards to regen, I can tell you that many in my guild are heavily debating the rewards of regen say versus increases your HP via STA or something similar.  Many will argue regen at high levels, especially for those encounters that last over a certain time interval (i.e. 30 seconds), it is better to have regen than HP.  I dont feel like posting the entire arguement, as I dont have the time at the moment, nor is it the topic of this thread, but if you do a little math, one can quickly see their point.  It overlooks certain other factors, but that is another discussion....<br />

Well thats not completley true, I mean it takes a long time, but you're still regening twice as fast as you would be without the troll/iksar regen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm starting to wonder if mobs can be coded to stun more frequently with their bashes.  It could explain why stuns don't seem to be a problem at level 40 or 50, but suddenly occurs more often at level 65 vs PoP mobs.<br />
<br />
I cant form any conclusion as to if people put too much weight into that ability or not. <br />
I just see it offered almost any time that someone points out the advantages of an Ogre.  If it was listed as one of the upsides, I wouldn't think of it as overrated.  But many times I've seen people gushing over the ability, as if it is a make-or-break ability.  Until now I haven't seen it as such.</div></div><hr />
