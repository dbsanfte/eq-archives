<br />
I say this by if you got DoN and OoW gear, you can probably do this, but is this possible?<br />
<br />
What about Bsts, doubt Sks since they have to tank and die, so not a good idea heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A monk soloed Naggy (granted, before they changed healing potions, but still, much worse gear), so I'd think that it might be possible for an SK with the right stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>velveetaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd say you probably could on an SK. Granted you have the augments, the armor, the regen and the saves. I think regeneration would be the biggest factor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>BludrainHalovex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This is actually something I've always itched to do back when I was level 50-52 but couldn't because people kept nagging me to do exp grinding, but I'd imagine they aren't that much tougher than the average PoN mob.  I'd suggest doing a few trial runs with yard trash around GY there first before you try to take either vox or naggy solo.  I'd the PoN mob's atk is much higher than either dragon though so if you get one down to at least 10% I'd say your good to go.</div></div><hr />

No TWO of any class are able to SOLO anything.</div></div><hr />

I know a guy who soloed Vulak ring with his necro friend boxing 4 other chars!!!!11!1on!!!e</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">hopefully he doesn't notice that.<br />
<br />
anyway, if you really want to solo naggy/vox without relying on healing potions, get an SK to 70 with 100+ aa including all of the SA/ToTC lines, delevel to 52 after getting those, have a breastplate of emblazoned souls to click, and that should be enough healing to keep you alive.<br />
and everyone will be amazed that you deleveled a level 70 to level 52.</div></div><hr />

You can still use the healing potions too, they're just drinks now and you're limited to the amount you can drink over time.  They can't be your only source of healing though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kelv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">According to a very knowledgeable SK who does not visit these forums anymore, a fungi tunic is all the regen you need for the job.<br />

<br />
So get yourself one of them and go to town!</div></div><hr />

thats awesome, and I &quot;know&quot; a pathetic little prick puffer whos penis is evidentally so small that they need to make a fake magelo. <br />

/salute Kelverz<br />
you go working girl</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>zarzac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Do aa's work if you are not of required level on poe servers ??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Fallgore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well one of my friends said that a lvl 51 Necro almost solo'd Vox with not so good gear, but I really don't see how that is possible when there is like a raid force of like 3 Necros, 5 Clrs, 5 Wars, etc.<br />
<br />
The only reason I doubt if a SK could solo Vox is because if she is hitting like 200's continuosly with no heal then you're screwed, and your pet can't really help that much at 51.<br />
<br />
Necros can dot and root (?) then FD while Pet tanks and they can heal Boner over there up *grin*<br />
<br />
I guess if you got like a-lot of AAs from being in Velks or something I guess that'd help alot heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Dohn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">No, AAs dont work even on blue servers if you arent the required level any more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
/wink</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>zarzac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Without the aa trick i really cant see it.  I was equipped bout the same now as i was at 52.  I tried it and failed.  I had a 70 clr and 70 rougue help me clear way to naggy then b4 pull had clr cast her best hot that would stick at 52.  With my magelo think I got him to like 92% b4 death.  Although you could get some slightly better equipment than what I have at 52 I don't see you solo'ing him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Deccado</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I don't think you can solo as an sk, due to the whole healing thing.  However, if you wanted to try it, make sure you have high resists.  FR over 300 if possible for Naggy, and MR too.  Vox is CR and MR if I recall correctly.  Anyway, it's possible to group them.  If a character over lvl 52 heals you, he or she will still be kicked from the zone.  However, the will only get kicked after the heal lands.  So if you have them bind near wherever you're going to be fighting, you can have them heal you, get kicked, gate back, and heal you again.  The amount of people you need to heal you varies on your hps and ac.<br />
<br />
I read similar strategies a few places and decided to try it.  It wasn't successful for me, but I only had one 70 clr healing - and it was on a slow-zoning computer.  With a second healer I think it would have been no problem to kill Naggy.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Elkar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">You can't bind in those zones, you'd have to run back, and it's not solo'ing if someone else is healing you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Fallgore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Well today my friend said his 51 Necro almost solo'd vox, he said his alt was uberly twinked though, but he accidently got aggro and got smashed because he wasn't able to heal his pet in time.<br />
<br />
That seems pretty cool, I feel that Necors are best, next comes Mages, but that's because of their pets doing all the work heh, just pet toy them, buff them with HoV, kei, etc. then let'em loose.<br />
<br />
I guess that seems pretty accurate, the Necro was an Ikky one (God, I don't see many DEFs on my server, there are more Ikky then DEFs,,  :confused:  lol,,,).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">You can't bind in those zones, you'd have to run back, and it's not solo'ing if someone else is healing you.<br />
Yes, you can (or could), my shaman had no issues.<br />
<br />
Class who can bind can bind themselves in places non binding classes can't.<br />
<br />
But you're right that it's not soloing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Shizzythugmasta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I know you can bind in sol b because i've seen clerics bind at the ragefire spawn to check him while doing their epics.  Also i'd think if you collected enuf Prayers of Life (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=11631)  you could probably do this.  Vox would be terrible though cuz of complete heal I'd think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Elkar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Guess I was thinking of the banish for &gt;52 that pops you outside of zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Fallgore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Out of curiosity, how much Hps does Vox have?<br />
At about level 51 soloing her must be pretty hard so you need Healing Potions and well Necros can get Pet toys (right?) and like HoV, etc. to buff up there point giving there pet about like another 2-3k Hps  :eek:  lol,,,<br />
<br />
Would the pet be pretty much gtg if you did that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Croix VorAbaddon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I wonder, would it possible for a high level necro to bind right before Naggy... DoT, banish, Gate, DoT, banish, Gate. Given how fast/slow Naggy banishes ((Haven't played with Naggy in awhile)) might be possible to just keep enough DoT's on the fuck to drop him. Any thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Dohn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">He's tethered - which means when he's entirely de-agroed, he wipes clean of any debuffs/dots/negative spells, and his hp reset at 100%.  As soon as the necro was banished, Nag'd be cleaned.<br />
<br />
Plus, I'm fairly certain even with extended range 5, you wouldnt be able to get close enough to Nag to hit.</div></div><hr />
