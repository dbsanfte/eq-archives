<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Warglory</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I had the raid and everything there in CoM for Kilidna kill, however, Kilidna just wouldnt change to the evil one and start beating on me, When I completed my epic 1.5 i guess I rushed it a little bit, any clue on how I fix this? Any help would be great, if you cant reach me, you can ;tell rodcet.warglory, thx!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>LocostrangeTF</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Did you continue the script with NPC after getting your 1.5?  She says she has a [vision].  <br />
<br />
Go back to her and talk to her.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hayniss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I know I did not continue the text when I got 1.5, went to her yesterday and she only responses with Huh?  /bugged it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Arangar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">did you try and say 'vision'?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hayniss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">yes, I did - even tried handing her 1.5, she just returned it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hayniss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I went to CoM to see if I could trigger the event and I was able to.  Only question I have is, does a chest drop when you kill Kilinda?  I'd like to be able to tempt my guild into working this into thier raid schedule and would be able to if a chest drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mordosskul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">No chest when I did it, and no chest the other two times I have helped with it. If you bring a couple groups with you, he drops very fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Chania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You can tell your guild a chest drops, and if it doesn't, blame it on SoE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Hayniss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well, we went there with 6 groups - for a mob that can hit for 4k+ it was overkill. he was dead in 30 secs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bamkan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">30 people was way overkill....  1 monk died...  He has low HP.  No chest after kill.</div></div><hr />
