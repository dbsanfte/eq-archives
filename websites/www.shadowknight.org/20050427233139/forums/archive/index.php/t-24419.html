<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lizmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Howdies new user here looking for some good info!<br />
Please, Im seeking pertient, educated responses, SO all the folks with the &quot; gome SK is the rock!&quot; and the &quot; De sk's chick look hot, HOLLA&quot; advice pass this thread up plz.<br />
<br />
I'm wondering of there is a Race linked HP penalty or bonus in game?<br />
<br />
For instance ( hypothetical situation, dont get bogged down by imposibility of this. )<br />
<br />
Would a :<br />
<br />
60SK, orge, base sta=100, no hp aa's.<br />
<br />
have teh same base ( naked ) hp as :<br />
<br />
60SK, Gnome, base sta=100, no hp aa's<br />
<br />
?<br />
<br />
Reason I ask is that it seems when i compare myself ( unbuffed hp wise ) to many SK's of my same &quot;tier&quot; ( gear, lvl , aa, sta ) im coming up 300-500 hp less that most other SK's. ( im a 68 IKS SK BTW ) Only thing that i could think of that woudl do this woudl be some type of HP penalty that IKS got to account for our regen.<br />
<br />
And it seems that Human, and Orge SK's always seem to have more HP than I.. even with lower gear and less sta.. go figure.<br />
<br />
posed this question a few times in serverwide channel but got fuzzy answers.. or no answers.. so thought id give the boards a try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KlowdKill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">HP is only determined by the raw hp, and your Stamina based on level.  Those two would have the same HP, yes.  An ogre, if he puts all his points into STA, has like 50 sta more than me.  That's 50 sta he doesn't have to consider while looking for gear, because he can easily sacrafice sta items for just the raw hp, and that might be where they're beating you.<br />
<br />
Also, you gain about 200-250hp for dinging 70, if you're comparing with people close to your level, person *Only!* two levels above you gains almost 300hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KlowdKill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What HP aa's do you actually have.  A magelo would be pretty keen too.<br />
<br />
Since I don't know your &quot;tier&quot; ...  My Stuff (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1160914) assuming you're not big time raider, I have basicly all non-raid gear as a dark elf you can compare HP's if you're not beyond me to begin with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Culdahl1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If an ogre started with 140sta and you started with 90sta then the ogre will have more HP while nekked given AA and lvls are equal.  Oh, and a lot of people lie about their actual HP's...I usually figure that if someone says they have 9000HP they probably have 8700.</div></div><hr />

Yes<br />
<br />
Also, the big Iksar advantage is the AC bonus not regen</div></div><hr />
