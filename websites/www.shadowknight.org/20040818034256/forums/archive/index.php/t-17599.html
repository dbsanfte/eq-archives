<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sadyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been told there is a quest in Sol Ro temple to reset your beta neutral faction.  I cannot find it on Alla's.  Does it still exist?  Any info would be apreciated.  I'm wondering cause I ran into a bug that appeared to trash my beta neutral (got a 'could not possibly get any worse' message after killing a shadowed man).  The guide i talked to didn't seem to think this is a big deal, but i've read about this faction a few times and am told it can affect the epic NPCs.  Kuron Ni in OT still cons apprehensive to me so /shrug.  Thoughts, suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Moghedred</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Don't know what you're talking about, but it's normal to receive a faction hit when you kill shadowed men. The hit is to the &quot;Shadowed Men Faction&quot; (that faction is opposed to Temple of Sol Ro). <br />
<br />
What makes you think you've actually trashed your beta neutral faction? I didn't even know you could take hits to it, let alone have one. You're possibly referring to the Truespirit faction (which is the faction needed for epics)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sadyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I went after the shadowed men for the essence, killed about a dozen when a necro (holding book) poped.  When I killed him, rather than the regular shadowed men and solsek ro faction messages, I got 'Your faction with Beta Neutral could not possibly get any worse'.  Hence my worry :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Drakonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The guy in Sol Ro Temple is only to reset &quot;True Spirit&quot; faction, which SKs ruin by doing Innoruuk's Curse (all faction dropped to zero when you do the final turn in, so 90% of epic npcs in the game will become kos).<br />
<br />
I forgot his name, but he isnt hard to find... if your Kos to True Spirit, I remember seeing 1 NPC on that faction... I killed him and it made no difference... after hunting around a while I found another NPC in a bedroom somewhere, killed him, and the True Spirit NPC became indifferent again.<br />
<br />
As for Beta Neutral, not sure on that... I didn't think you could actually lower it.  (Maybe at its lowest it's still indifferent?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Moghedred</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ok. My guess is that was just a bug. this is how you can easily check your Beta Neutral faction. When you zone in to Lavastorm, immediately to your left you 'll see an NPC called Ruathey. She's on Beta Neutral. Con her see what it says. If she scowls you have a problem. If she doesn't you're fine. <br />
<br />
The reason I think it's a bug, is that you don't get faction hits from Beta Neutral mobs even when you kill them. At least that's always been my impression/experience of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">No, no, no Mog.<br />
<br />
What you need to go to test BetaNuetral is go to Dragon Necropolis and then head back towards the rat area.  If the shade of Jaled'Dar deathtouches you you're porbably KoS. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Moghedred</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Lol you are right of course, Gnar!! Much better way to check it!! :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>shadowblayd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I also got this faction message after killing the necro shadowman in Lavastorm a few months ago.  I petitioned it and a guide said they consulted a GM and they said it is just a script error.</div></div><hr />
