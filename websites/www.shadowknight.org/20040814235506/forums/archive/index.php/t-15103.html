<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zogglebokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wondering something. Ive read through some of the walk throughs and went through the deep some last night. Was just wondering if its an particular thought horror that can drop them or any? Was wondering because before you get to bridge area there are a group of thought horror's. Was different ones from a thought horror and the young and the casters. Just want to make sure i'm not wasting my time in this spot. Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
before anyone asks, it is soloable, but harder since they made mobs able to get down cliffs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zogglebokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thank you Krushum. Knowing any but young helps alot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Darklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">spot were i found that it will all ways drop is cross invis bridge and go left and go all the way to end. There is 2 spawns in front of tunnel, kill them and sooner or later a shard will drop.</div></div><hr />
