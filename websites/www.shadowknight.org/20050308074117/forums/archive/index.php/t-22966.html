<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>nightjackal77</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok For the Muckglider Breeder here are a bit more information<br />
<br />
I tryed to times tonight to kill him..on the second time we dropped him easy.<br />
<br />
First Try we learned this: 6 Spawns are Comfirmed agian and can be pulled torwards zone and left there. (Corpse campers)  Way we got them out (died 4 times doing this)  I aggro'd by standing torwards the ent of the room form zone in side (I was on the stairs) I used a quick spear to get aggro and then instant invis and ran for the zone in. as I ran had a mage do a coh (12 sec of running) and FDed once Coh landed. did this about 4-5 times to get all six out then trained them all down the hall and away from her.<br />
<br />
Next we got her to 7% on the first try...would have won but first 45 secs we learned the resist of the mob which are as follows.<br />
<br />
Disease and Posion is basically Nerfed...never got any to land with shaman or SK after doing Malos and Decay.<br />
<br />
Has a really high fire resist....it was resisting about 60% of everything spell.<br />
<br />
Has almost no Magic resist (unsnarable though) Bane, Black Steel, and Aura of Pain landed all the time. <br />
<br />
Also has no Cold resist either<br />
<br />
Hope this helps....btw the tank I had was a warrior with about 9.8k buffed and about 1600 ac had no real healing problems.<br />
<br />
Murkglider also has a AE called Tendrial Strike (I think that's the name) has like 32 disease counters and does 500dd and 200 per tick dot that lasts a long time. Large range too<br />
<br />
<br />
Last thing...I am not a supper powerful SK and nor was our crew most where not even EP and had no VT gear on casters. I buff to 9.1k and have 1700+ AC  (mostly VT gear and mix of quest and other times)<br />
<br />
And on to the farming!!<br />
 <br />
Later,<br />
