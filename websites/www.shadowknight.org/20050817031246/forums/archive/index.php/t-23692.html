I'm fully geared and have pp for spells and to pay druids to PL me.  I'm just shy of 30 and would appreciate suggestions on where to get PL'd up to 40. (at 40 i'm going to CoM,  that place gives my 51 iksar warrior 2% exp per kill)  I'm tired of The Overthere and I hate DL.  Is there a  Paludal Caverns of the 30's?</div></div><hr />

DSP until you go to CoM - Zelniaks are good, just watch out for wolves and lightcrawlers (they will agro)</div></div><hr />

If you got druid go to Xygoz area in Kaesora and rake in Exp.  Also want to add I hope your on Firiona Vie cause what the hell did you spend 800k on a regular server hehe.  My SK twink broke 1k HP at lvl 1 and had Vindi BP, Fungi, full Ornate, Eyepatch of Plunder and a Ornate Greatblade and I didnt even break 500k.</div></div><hr />

*EDIT* Magelo please, I'm curious what 880k can buy you.</div></div><hr />

I spent the cash on these 2 characters as follows:<br />
<br />
The cowl was the haste item on my warrior, however i wanted the helmet of zek so i gave the cowl to my sk, bought the runed bolster belt and helmet of zek.<br />
<br />
Scepter of Destruction:  Awesome proc, got nerfed recently.  Used to proc at lvl 0.  Still not lore ;-)<br />
<br />
BoC:  Any warrior's dream pre-elemental.<br />
<br />
Everything else my sk is wearing is bazaar bought.<br />
<br />
After 10 days of looking, there were no fungi tunics for sale.  I still have 120k in bank on top of the 20kish i've spent on PL's.</div></div><hr />

Where's a list of the hotzones, complete preferably?<br />
<br />
I've the opposite task ahead of me; thinking about PLing my wife's 46 shammy with my 65 SK.  At what points can they group for XP or not; starting at hers 46 mine 65 (since I need to level my SK soon as well)?</div></div><hr />

Hotzone lists are in the patch messages.<br />
<br />
The rule of thumb for when you can group is 1.5*level of lowest person, meaning at 46 you can group with 46*1.5=69.</div></div><hr />

Take her to PoJ and just solo around the first loop of jail cells. Hell, you can even pull them through the bars in the GY area if you'd like...but yeah, to do a friend a favor, i put his 46 ranger on box#2, and had him autofollow on me, and then i just ran around the jail cells, and in about 5 hours total of this, he was 51. Worked like butter, and the ranger didn't attack a darn thing.<br />

Not sure where to take the wiz at 52 for pleveling or if I should just start quad-kiting wyverns in cobalt scar.  Any recommendations?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daegul Mistweaver</div><div class="date">02-08-2005, 09:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Was thinking of Guk myself since it's listed as a hotzone (as Silvershadow pointed out) till 55 and I still am working faction there (I must have been at -20k faction to start; but GMs can't be bothered to look into that, I asked, they guy was a moron and didn't get the point).  I may move on to Katta after that since it's a hotzone thru 60 (try that next Bolas, plenty of kiting room, better than wyverns, and you can soften them up -&gt; FD to PL the wiz) or PoJ since wouldn't hurt to at least get the alt flag pieces outta there while I'm at it.</div></div><hr />
