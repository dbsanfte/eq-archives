Ok I hope that was an attempt at internet sarcasm. Cause you got too be fucking kidding!<br />
<br />
No way does this improve your chances, If someone wants to buy your item, you bet your life they are going to send you a damn tell. For once I aggree with the gnome here.<br />
<br />
Shut the fuck up with the PST bulshit =P all it does is prove how desperate you are to get rid of the item, get a gate, ect</div></div><hr />

Of course there's always the other possibility - that they do it to irk the silly, petty little people who must constantly find fault with everyone else in this game who doesn't follow their silly, petty little rules. Hmm, if that's the case they must be reading this and laughing, because it worked.<br />

I use it quite often actually!!  For one main reason, I can't stand when you /ooc or /auction for something and somebody replies in /ooc and /auction.  When I put the &quot;pst&quot; on the end, it is so I can walk across the room and do something else because I know I'll be able to recognize the purple tell I get out of the hundreds of green blah blah blah crap on the screen.  <br />

It is 3 little letters pal, and if it really affects you so much, to the point where you can't enjoy &quot;the GAME!!!!!&quot;, then you are the twit, not I.  As for getting a clue,  don't need one.  I figured out the answer already...  It is a game!!!  Just a game and nothing more!!! People like you should not play online games, due to the fact you are socially intolerant and are incapable of understanding the fact that the little world Mommy and Daddy created for you is not the same for everyone else.  I would suggest you go back to playing Donkey Kong, but you would probably start a rant about how it is impossible for Monkeys to roll 3 barrels in a row that fast!!!  In case you do, here is another clue.  Donkey Kong is just a game too!!!<br />

<br />
I Thessalonians 5:21: &quot;Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.'' <br />
<br />
In these last days, there is so much dishonesty, lying and deception, it becomes difficult at times to know who is telling the truth and who is not. Even when people are sincere and truthful, they can still be sincerely deceived. Telling the truth and knowing the truth are two different things. People who sincerely believe something to be the truth and repeat it as such, are truthful people. However, knowing the truth involves knowing the One who is Truth, Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ and His Words found in the Bible are the only real source of truth. That is why the Bible verse in 1 Thess. 5:21 warns us to &quot;Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jesus also warned his disciples in Matt. 24:3-4, &quot;And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world? And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you.&quot; The very first thing Jesus warned about in this scripture is deception.<br />
<br />
The news media of our day is continuously reporting a myriad of deceptive schemes, scams and plots that are masterminded by dishonest people. Unsuspecting people are caught in these fraudulent webs spun by evil people who prey on the ignorant and gullible. Many of God's own people are destroyed because they lack the knowledge of the Word of God to be able to discern truth from error. Hosea 4:6a says, &quot;My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.&quot; We have all been deceived at times, however the Bible tells us who is at the root of deception and how we can overcome it. <br />
<br />
Rev. 12:9 &quot;And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him. 10 And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night. 11 And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death.&quot;<br />
<br />
If we are to live the overcoming life and escape the deception of our age we must seek Jesus with a total commitment and give Bible study priority in our lives. One does not arrive at being an overcomer until he first learns the all important lesson of &quot;testing&quot; or &quot;proving&quot; the issues of this life. In the hour that we live there are so many things that are false and evil. We must be constantly on guard and &quot;prove&quot; things, lest we become ensnared by something that is wicked.<br />
<br />
Cults are spreading. Eastern idolatrous religions are creeping into our country in very subtle forms, and many people are being deceived and have accepted their practices, without even being aware of their evil. Some religious groups have existed for years under the guise of Christianity, and yet are far from the teachings of Jesus Christ. The Lord warns us of these false teachers and tells us to beware of them.<br />
<br />
Looking at Matthew 7:15-23, we find Jesus gives us the guideline for determining false prophets:<br />
<br />
&quot;Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves. Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit. A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire. Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them. Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven. Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.''<br />
<br />
Certainly, we are admonished to be on guard. However, some go to such extremes as to become narrow-minded and closed to some beautiful truths in the name of being careful. What should our role as Christians be in regard to acceptance of a new thought, idea or doctrine? We are told to &quot;prove all things&quot;, not to reject them because they might be strange or new to us. However, we should not receive them either, until we first prove them. How do we prove things? All true Christians are in agreement that our standard is the Word of God, the Bible. God gave us this Book as a reference, standard, or gauge so we could know whether something is good or evil, truth or error, right or wrong. II Timothy 3:16-17: &quot;All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.''<br />
<br />
One of our major faults as Christians is that we tend to quote men on certain subjects instead of referring to the Book God gave us. We recognize that God gave us men to lead us into the truths of God, but our problem becomes: who are the true men of God and who are the false ones that Christ warned us about? Sometimes we tend to evaluate men according to the size of their ministries, their popularity with men, or their endowment of certain gifts, etc.<br />
<br />
The Lord said in verse 20 of Matthew 7 that we would know them by their fruits. What are these fruits? Galatians 5:22-24 defines them as being the fruit of the Spirit. &quot;But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance: against such there is no law. And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.'' We are told to look at their lives and see if these fruits are predominant in them and examine if they are living the crucified life. Of course, we must allow for imperfections that have not been overcome yet; but we should readily see the fruit of the Spirit in more abundance than the imperfections. One way we can check this is to notice the words that a man speaks. The Scripture says in Matthew 12:33-35, &quot;Either make the tree good, and his fruit good; or else make the tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by his fruit. O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh. A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things.''<br />
<br />
Many people have been led astray when they could have recognized the wrong spirit simply by the braggadocios and prideful words of men who exalted themselves instead of Christ. Others would have been spared if they had examined the lifestyles of certain men who claim to be God's anointed. Their lifestyles are far from temperate, reflecting the most expensive and extravagant clothes, diamonds, homes, cars, etc. This is not referring to well-dressed men and women, and nice homes, but the extremes which reveal anything but the nature of Christ. Of course, neither is the other extreme of poverty the nature of Christ. Men of God should live temperate, moderate lives, overcoming poverty and avoiding extreme wealth. Jesus always went about giving to the poor. He never stored up His wealth even though He apparently handled a lot of money, thus the need for a treasurer, Judas (John 12:4-6). He gave away the things He could have used on Himself, yet He never lacked as He went about ministering. He should be our example today. The affection and lust for the things of this world do not portray the Spirit of Christ.<br />
<br />
Examining the conversation of these leaders can quickly reveal the God they serve. Do they speak of God's kingdom, His righteousness, and His love; or does their conversation center on the things of this world and life? Are they peacemakers, sowing mercy and love? Are they gentle and patient, or do they lose their temper easily? Do they walk in faith, or are they continually looking to other men for their needs to be supplied? Are they always pressuring people for money, or do they simply receive those gifts of money as unto the Lord? Do they have the joy of the Lord, or do they minister out of duty? Are they truly joyous with that joy spilling over to others, or do they continually complain and gripe over all the things that are not pleasing to them? Is goodness evident in their lives instead of evil? Do they put people in bondage by always threatening them with the wrath of God, or is freedom of choice extended with the warning of the penalties of sin? Jesus came to set us free, not to bring us under the bondage of men.<br />
<br />
Let us prove all leaders and see if their fruit is good fruit. Do they love and not hate, have joy instead of depression, and promote peace instead of strife? Are they longsuffering (patient) or impatient, gentle or harsh? Do they walk in faith, or doubt and unbelief? Are they meek, giving God the glory for their talents and gifts or do they pridefully talk of all they are doing or their group is doing? Does temperance prevail not only in their lifestyle, but in their personal habits as well or do extremes exist that do not glorify God? In essence they will not live for themselves, but for others as Jesus did. They will live a crucified life that glorifies God! Proverbs 20:11 says, &quot;Even a child is known by his doings, whether his work be pure, and whether it be right.''<br />
<br />
As we examine lives by this standard we must be careful not to go to extremes ourselves and expect total perfection of all ministers. There are many godly men and women who are called of God and have overcome in many areas, although they still have some weak areas. They are believing as they walk with the Lord that these too will be perfected. <br />
<br />
One of the greatest ills in the church today is the mixture of the church and the world. The church is no longer separated from the world, but looks just like the world. The world does not recognize Christians because they do the same thing the world does. They eat and drink the same things, go to the same places, etc. In Exodus 12:38 we find an account of a people called the &quot;mixed multitude.'' The background of this account tells about Israel being led out of Egyptian bondage by Moses. When they left, some of the Egyptians who had married the Israelites left with them. Also there were those that were half-Egyptian and half-Israelite. The Old Testament has many accounts of &quot;types'' that are lessons for us today. I Corinthians 10:5-6 says, &quot;But with many of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness. Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted.'' The example we are to see here is a lesson of what happens to those who are not true Israelites at heart. We see in Numbers 11 that after the Israelites had wandered in the wilderness awhile, they began to gripe and complain. This spirit was spawned from those that were of the mixed multitude, who stayed in the outermost part of the camp. They didn't come to the center of the camp where the tabernacle was pitched, as they didn't want to be exposed by the glory of the Lord. Their allegiance soon waned under trial and persecution, and they longed to go back to Egypt where the fish, cucumbers, melons, garlic, leeks, and onions were. Soon their lust for these things overcame them, and they were destroyed by the fire of God and the wrath of the Lord.<br />
<br />
Today we find the same problem in the church. The lust for the things of this world, plus uncommitted hearts that contain a mixture of this world and the Lord's kingdom, will ultimately bring the judgment of God. It was not God's intention for Israel to wander in the wilderness for 40 years, as He wanted to bring them to the promised land that was flowing with milk and honey. It is the same today; He wants to bless His children, but their rebellion and lack of commitment does not allow Him to do so. The Word of God proves we have a loving and just God. As we seek Him and grow in His word, we will not suffer His judgment on sin. The judgment of the wrath of God comes only upon sin and this world. If we have Jesus in our hearts and have been forgiven of our sins and have renounced the things of this world, then we have no need to fear the wrathful judgment of God. It will not fall on God's children who are striving to follow Him. Praise God!<br />
<br />
In conclusion, let us look to God to prove all things. &quot;Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord'' (Ephesians 5:10). Only by coming before Him with a teachable spirit can we be taught the truth and recognize error. As we become more acquainted with the real, we will be able to better discern the counterfeit. The devil has a counterfeit for every truth of God. However, we need not fear being deceived if we are in fellowship with the Lord, for He will deliver us from every evil as we continue to follow Him.<br />
<br />
Our daily prayer should be &quot;Lord, cleanse me from all error and renew my mind. Lord, I desire to know the truth even if it means correction and discomfort for me. Change my thoughts and heart to be your thoughts and heart. Father, give me a teachable spirit. Take my desires, dreams and visions and give me yours. Cleanse me from all that offends you. Create within me a clean heart, O Lord. Amen.''<br />
<br />
Better?   <br />
<br />
 May the Lord have mercy on your soul.</div></div><hr />

BRICKLAYING MADE EASY<br />
<br />
]The process of building in brick begins with the arrival of bricks on site. Nowadays lorries that can cope with ten thousand bricks, and which are equipped with hoists, pick up loads from the brickyard, where they are stacked in piles each containing several packets of bricks. The stacks have been built up by the use of forklift trucks, that modern blessing. Simple to learn to use, and nimble and easily manoeuvrable, the forklift truck makes short work of what was once heavy manual labour. <br />
<br />
At the site, the hoist on the lorry is used to lift off the blocks of bricks and put them down just where they are to be stored. The whole process is simple rapid and cheap. <br />
<br />
The bricklayer can have the bricks delivered to him by forklift truck or hoist. For small jobs a labourer can carry the bricks to him in a hod, a beautifully simple wooden holder which rests on the shoulder, with a pole that hangs down near the hand. There are fewer hods to be seen now, and lightweight electric hoists do the job very well; but the hod is one of those tools that superficially are so simple, and are actually a delightful demonstration of man's ingenuity. They can be a source of danger if some careless handling should cause the bricks to slide off and tumble earthwards. <br />
<br />
You may come across other types of hod in various countries around the world, though they are fast disappearing except in the more remote areas. One cunningly simple arrangement is a flat board that is cut out to fit round the neck of the labourer, the bricks being so disposed on this surface as to achieve a balance while the load is being carried from one place to another. <br />
<br />
Mortar is needed in quantity, and as the work proceeds both bricks and mortar travel further and further upwards. In the old days a &quot;brickie&quot; and his mate often worked together for much of their lives, and knew one another's characteristics so well that the work went smoothly, much as the driver and stoker of a steam engine learned to work closely together. The mortar was prepared as and when required, just the right amount at the right time, so that the bricklayer was never kept waiting, yet the mortar didn't lay around, going off before it could be used. <br />
<br />
It can be instructive to watch a brick structure in the making, even quite a small one, to see how the materials arrive as required. <br />
<br />
Just as a good labourer keeps his shovel smooth, clean and free from material that makes it hard to use, so does a good bricklayer keep his trowel in a high state of cleanliness, and his line, plumb and level in good condition. In the world of building, as in other spheres, you can judge a craftsman by the condition of his tools. Half a century ago, an employer would ask to see the tools of an applicant for a job, and on that basis judge the skill of the man. <br />
<br />
Once you understand the reasons for laying bricks in a certain pattern you will more easily appreciate the brick structures you see. You might also spot the differences between good and poor quality work, though you should not necessarily condemn the latter. For some odd jobs it isn't worth employing an expert. If you want some odd length of low wall for creepers to climb, or to have a rude appearance, then the rougher the better, within limits. <br />
<br />
We shall look first at what we can consider to be the most elementary, the least complicated bricklaying job, the erection of a short length of straight vertical wall. <br />
<br />
We shall assume that a suitable foundation or footing has been prepared, a level run of concrete wide enough to provide a sound base on which to erect the wall. Such foundations are designed to spread the load of the wall to minimise subsidence when the load is applied. <br />
<br />
If you push a pointed stick into some damp soil or sand it may not take much force to penetrate; but if you try to do the same thing with a thick blunt stick it is harder. This is because the pointed stick is concentrating your force over a small area, producing a high penetrating stress. The blunt stick is spreading the load over a larger area, and the stress is therefore smaller. Thus, we can so design our foundations that the stress applied is well within the safe limits. <br />
<br />
The strength of a sample of soil can be measured in the laboratory with precision, and from this the safe working stress can be calculated. Knowing the load to be applied by the building, we can arrive at the necessary area of the footings. Usually these calculations are based on unit length of a wall, when a wall is being considered. <br />
<br />
So the width of the foundation is found, and the requirements met by spreading the load over a mass of concrete, stone or brick. <br />
<br />
If you like equations, then you may care to note that the width of the foundations, W, is given by the simple equation <br />
<br />
<br />
W = Load/f <br />
, where L is the imposed load per unit length of wall, and f is the safe working stress on the soil. So the higher the safe compressive stress on the soil, the narrower the footings can be. <br />
<br />
There are limits in the use of such equations, of course, since a very narrow foundation might be unstable. Generally, for small buildings, there are &quot;rules of thumb&quot; for such things. <br />
<br />
The next task is the &quot;setting-out&quot;, and for our purposes we shall look at what is wanted for a straight length of walling. <br />
<br />
Having decided on where the wall is to be built we put a peg in at each end of a line, fixing the line of the wall, and dig away the top soil, to make a trench suitable to receive the concrete for the foundations. Nowadays there are nippy little digging machines to excavate a trench of the desired width rapidly, and even small building contractors often hire them to save money on labour. The range of equipment for hire has been greatly extended over the past few decades. <br />
<br />
A builder will set up &quot;profiles&quot;, three pieces of wood nailed together like miniature goalposts, and use lengths of suitable line to connect them, providing a series of straight lines to which the digger can operate. The bricklayer will work to these as he lays bricks on the bed of mortar that has been applied to the foundations. <br />
<br />
By working from each end, whole bricks can be used until they nearly meet. The remaining gap is filled by a &quot;closer&quot;, a brick that has been cut to the right length. At one time a closer was struck from a whole brick by a suitable clout with the trowel. Now there are simple machines that will cut a closer, or shape a brick at any angle, with ease. They demonstrate the purchase one can get with a long lever. Power cutters are used too. <br />
<br />
It is unlikely that the first course will have open ends. It will usually have a &quot;return&quot; or corner at each end, for stability, or perhaps a pillar, or adjacent wall. The courses will key into such features. <br />
<br />
This first course demands accuracy, for if it wanders, or is not level, length-wise and across, the rest of the wall cannot run true. So great care is taken to lay each brick level, and align it accurately. <br />
<br />
It all looks so easy at the hands of a skilled craftsman, but proves very awkward when essayed by someone without the skill and experience that comes from long training and practice. <br />
<br />
When the second course is begun, the decision is taken as to the type of &quot;bond&quot; or pattern, and how the joints are to be made, that is the kind of &quot;pointing&quot;, both very important. <br />
<br />
Looking first at the bond, there is a choice of several, but in practice the predominant ones are the &quot;English bond&quot; and the &quot;Flemish bond&quot;. <br />
<br />
The reason for these &quot;bonds&quot; is to ensure that there is no straight line of mortar running up through the wall, that is, the perpends are not in line, as this would be a line of weakness. <br />
<br />
At this stage it could be instructive to experiment with a number of bricks. However, it is much better if you try the following indoors, with a pile of suitable wood blocks, say a three or four dozen, each of the same proportions as a standard brick, though not necessarily the same size. A child's blocks will be admirable. <br />
<br />
First lay a block on its largest face. Then on top of it place another, and another, and so build a little tower of blocks, as far as you can. See how the stability decreases as the height of the tower increases. At first, with just two or three blocks, all is firm; but as more and more blocks are laid, however carefully, the pile starts to get wobbly. Eventually, the whole thing is so unstable that the slightest shake will cause it to collapse. <br />
<br />
The controlling factor for this instability is the ratio of the height to the cross-sectional area of the pile. Actually it is not just the area, but the shape of the cross-section too. In all columns this ratio, known as the l/k ratio, governs its stability. The letter &quot;k&quot; is a measure of the spread of the material in a section, and is called the &quot;radius of gyration&quot;. <br />
<br />
You can increase this &quot;radius of gyration&quot; by building the column with a larger cross-section say starting on a square base formed by four blocks. You will find that such a pillar can be carried to a much greater height without disaster. If you have enough blocks you can start from a larger base, so that the cross-section is bigger, more spread out. You will soon be convinced of the value of a large value of &quot;k&quot;. <br />
<br />
Now lay a row of blocks, say half a dozen, along a straight line on the floor, touching one another, and lay another row on these, face upon face. <br />
<br />
When laying this second row, if you keep the joins vertically above one another so the perpends are in one straight vertical line, you will soon appreciate that the wall is as unstable as the first pile of blocks that you built. <br />
<br />
However, if the joins are offset, so that the gaps are not in line, you see an immediate increase in stability. The blocks are locked into one another; they form a bond. Herein lies the simple secret of building in brick. <br />
<br />
Experiment with different ways of building with the wooden blocks, and in particular notice how stable a wall is when a proper bond is used. Try the effect of &quot;stretcher&quot; bond and &quot;header&quot; bond, and alternate courses of these. <br />
<br />
See how a weakness occurs when vertical joins are aligned with one another. A few hours playing on the floor can teach you much about brick structures. To a certain extent a child learns the principles of stability during play with a box of wooden blocks. <br />
<br />
When you look at a plain brick wall, see how the vertical joins are arranged, running up in a kind of zigzag pattern. <br />
<br />
In good bricklaying the lines of mortar are clearly seen, straight and level, best seen by looking along them from one end. <br />
<br />
If you place your eye suitably, you can look upwards along the line of the vertical lines of mortar, and see how they too are carefully aligned. A well-built plain wall is a delight to those who know how to look at it. <br />
<br />
Returning now to the idea of the &quot;bond&quot;, we have a wide choice of patterns, and some of these are illustrated. You will soon be able to recognise the different kinds, and notice that they all avoid positioning any vertical joins in line with one another. <br />
<br />
When the mortar is laid and the brick positioned, the excess mortar escapes from between the bricks, and the bricklayer removes the surplus with the trowel. How he does this is a matter of some interest, for this determines the type of &quot;pointing&quot;. <br />
<br />
The simplest approach is to scrape the surplus mortar flush with the brick surface, so that the line of mortar is level with the wall throughout. The advantage of this pointing is that it is the cheapest, requiring no further treatment. You will see plenty of this about, everywhere. However, there are other kinds of finish that add to the beauty of the finished brickwork. <br />
<br />
Some of the ways of dealing with the joints between bricks are illustrated.Good pointing is a matter of pride with the skilled bricklayer. However, it must be realised that time spent on anything other than the strictly utilitarian aspects does incur extra expense. So the inner faces of walls usually have nothing more than flush pointing at best. <br />
<br />
Deviation from flush pointing is carried out before the mortar has set, so that when all has dried out and finished the beautifying effect of the different types of pointing can be seen and appreciated. <br />
<br />
A cavity wall is one in which there are effectively two separate and parallel walls with a space between, to provide insulation and stability. Sometime the inner wall uses building blocks instead of bricks. The pointing for theses is flush. <br />
<br />
When a cavity wall is erected metal strips called &quot;wall ties&quot; are laid across the gap at intervals, in the soft mortar, so that they tie together those two separate walls. These are of wire or strip, twisted so that they cannot carry moisture across the gap. You will not normally see these except during construction or demolition. Look out for them. They are examples of simple ingenuity at its best. Any water attempting to travel along them is unable to climb the slope of the fixtures. They are protected against rust of course, usually galvanised, i.e. coated in zinc. <br />
<br />
The ascent of moisture from the ground through the bricks is prevented by a damp proof course, usually referred to as the &quot;d.p.c.&quot;, an impermeable layer placed between the lower courses. The choice is wide, including slate, asphalt, glazed stoneware slabs, lead sheet, or PVC. Any material that prevents the passage of water may be used, though not those that might be affected by the mortar. You can see the edges of these dpc's from the outside, a few inches above ground level. <br />
<br />
There are occasions when a bricklayer is required to incorporate a vertical dpc, and in such cases impermeable material is taken up the inside of the wall to protect the inner wall against the transfer of water from the outside. <br />
<br />
Tops of walls which do not support roofing work are vulnerable to rainwater, and are usually protected by coping courses, consisting of bricks which are sloped to shed the water, or by special coping bricks, often flat underneath and curved on top. These bridge the upper course, and rainwater drips clear of the face of the wall itself. <br />
<br />
Specially shaped bricks are often to be seen in pillars where the cross-section changes. They are usually arranged so that water running down the pillar is deflected outwards at the change of section. Not only does this help to protect the lower part of the pillar, but also the gradual change of section avoids the stress raiser occasioned by a sudden change. <br />
<br />
The craft of a tiler differs from that of a bricklayer; but clay tiles are made in the same way as bricks, from the same materials. They are not usually laid in mortar, except when used for floors, but hung on battens, lengths of timber nailed in place to receive them, on walls and roofs. Roofing tiles look delightful when newly laid; but when old roofs reach the stage where they begin to sag artists find them particularly picturesque. <br />
<br />
The bricklayer himself will sometimes make use of tiles here and there, and you may spot them, for example in fireplace surrounds, and other places where they are used for decorative effect. A coping course of sloping tiles is attractive and effective. <br />
<br />
Sills are frequently tiled, too, and are laid with a fall to shed rain. <br />
<br />
Specially shaped and moulded bricks are often built into structures, beneath window ledges, at the tops of pillars, and wherever a little fancywork adds to the attraction. Brick stockists publish catalogues showing the choices available for the benefit of architects and builders. Look out for these, especially in buildings put up in the Victorian era. You can find these in humble cottages as well as in mansions. <br />
<br />
It is well worth looking upward towards the roof in some of the older gracious homes. Fine decorative brickwork can be seen in the chimneys. The chimney is fast disappearing as an architectural feature; but in their day some magnificent examples were built. In many houses, where fireplaces were put into most of the rooms, the chimneystacks were wonders of craftsmanship, each chimney being different in appearance. <br />
<br />
You may sometimes see tall narrow chimney stacks which over the years have bent over like bananas. It isn't really the fault of the bricklayer. A chimneystack is a stationary object, and there it stands while the sun rises, and slowly bakes one face, the southern one in the northern hemisphere, for hours at a time. Then comes the cool of the night, sometimes below zero. <br />
<br />
So the pointing on the southern face undergoes a daily cycle of heating and cooling, day after day and year after year. If any moisture gets into the joints the changes can impose serious stresses in the exposed structure, and the mortar will deteriorate. As a result, on an old cottage the single chimneystack may bend over like an obsequious servant, and some are braced with steel rods. <br />
<br />
Although the brick is a simple lump of baked clay a man of imagination could produce amazing variations in form by cunning changes in the arrangement of each succeeding course. Old chimneys are a brick-watcher's delight. <br />
<br />
One more item should be mentioned here, the requirements for retaining walls. Water falling on the soil behind a wall percolates downwards, and eventually the material is soaked. This then imposes a hydrostatic pressure on the wall. For a low wall this is not very great, but for high walls the force can be considerable. The resultant force from this pressure is exerted about a third of the way up, where it has a significant leverage over the base. The overturning effect can push over the wall, and steps are taken to prevent this. <br />
<br />
You may sometimes see holes in the wall, low down, containing short lengths of pipe, which drain away any water which might otherwise accumulate behind. Further, the bricklayer will sometimes be required to build a wall with a &quot;batter&quot;, or backward slope, to improve stability, or buttresses to take the horizontal load. <br />
<br />
Buttresses are sometimes used to prop up a wall which is beginning to tilt, from subsidence, or the powerful action of the roots of trees planted unwisely too near. A buttress need not be ugly, and can add charm to an old wall. Look out for them. They are of great variety, and usually incorporate sloping courses. All these points are to be noted when brick-watching. <br />
<br />
Further, you may sometimes come across fine examples of the bricklayer's art in the form of arches, circular openings, decorative features of all kinds. Modern methods using concrete blocks and slabs have not killed off the need for skilled bricklayers. <br />
<br />
There are courses at many colleges to teach the art and the craft, and plenty of young people anxious to learn. <br />
<br />
Bricklaying has always had an appeal for the amateur, particularly for those in retirement. It is an occupation with a special attraction for those who enjoy the open air and the creativity associated with seeing a structure grow beneath one's hands from a pile of bricks. You may well be attracted yourself. If so, get a good pair of gloves, for bricks are hard on one's hands ....</div></div><hr />

Why do you even have Shout/Auction on??  Any one too lazy to use trader mode in the bazaar is not worh my time!  And /shout is the forum for all the lesser lifeforms on the server.  <br />
<br />
A) If you want to barter with someone who isn't AFK or a bot, it's nice to be able to auction your items for TRADE.<br />
<br />
B) If I have to train (not often) I will use /shout over /occ as the RED text isn't used as much and people will know that they might get run over.<br />
<br />
So, I could assume two things off your statement.<br />
<br />
1) You have all the pp in the world and you buy your high-end items from the scalpers. (Or maybe you pay with $$, i guess that works too)<br />
<br />
2) You might miss an important shout like a train, or some item is rotting. Maybe youre really uber and never die and you can eat any train in the game with your fine steel.</div></div><hr />

To answer your ridiculous assumptions about myself...<br />
<br />
1.  No I do not &quot;have all the pp in the world&quot;, however I am able to equip my alts and myself adequately enough via the Bazaar feature or Server Market forums.  My /auc is never on since the inception of the Bazaar.  I find absolutely no need for it, and thus far have not suffered because of it.<br />
<br />
Paying real $ for pixels in a game is something I have and will never do.  What I would pay money for is to subscribe to an idiot free Server however I am sure that no matter how well monitored people such as you would inevitably slip through the cracks.<br />
<br />
2. I could care less about a rotting item, particularly I am most likey too busy to go out of my way to loot some item that is unwanted by the group/person who killed the mob that dropped it.<br />
<br />
Perhaps you have a point with the trains.  I generally try to stay out of zones or area in zones which are commonly trained.  I dont believe I have died to many trains called or not ( I wouldnt know as my /shout is turned off.)  Death from trains usually occur when people are not paying attention or are AFK, this being the case /shout is not going to make much of a difference.  If I cant get FD off or zone when I see a train headed my way its my own fault.</div></div><hr />

Do you realize just the idiots would pay for such a server?:rolleyes:<br />

<br />
Look at it this way. The &quot;idiots&quot; would think they were not such and thus think the server was a better place for them. However, the term &quot;idiot&quot; in this case is relative to what your standards of social edict are. So, I would assume you would have an entire server of yourself, and maybe a few close friends. Anyone else may not meet your social edict standards.</div></div><hr />

No I have never paid real $ for equipment, and I will never pay real $ in the future.  I have much more important things to spend my hard earned cash on.<br />

What I realize is only an idiot would fail to see the sarcasm in my original statement.  Anyone can pay to play this game, and to be perfectly honest anyone can level thier Character to 60 or 65, so inevitably I am bound to run across those with less than the normal intelligence level of say a 12 year old.<br />
<br />
I know SoE will never find a way to create a server which is idiot free, so I can confidently keep my hard earned money in the bank and not have to worry about shelling out more $ for this game than the $12.95 that I already do.</div></div><hr />

Actually, I was rather confused. To me it sounded like you paid for gear with real $$ once before and then decided you would never pay for gear with real $$ again.<br />

Seeing how sarcasm is based of the tone of your writing, it is sometimes hard to know whether someone is being sarcastic. Ones intelligence does not mean they will always recognize sarcasm when the tone was of a work is of a generally serious nature.<br />

<br />
 Some of my best deals are people wanting pp fast and run to the bazaar and auction a few times over /ooc or /auc, or /shout.<br />
<br />
So keep it off if you like, better chance at deals for others.<br />

Shai Din Bauble 2k<br />
Vengeful Diamond Blade 4.5k<br />
FBSS 1k<br />
BD's at 200pp each<br />

All kinds of deals and even if I dont need them, I can make a few k just wathcing impatient people in /auc trying to dump loot.</div></div><hr />
