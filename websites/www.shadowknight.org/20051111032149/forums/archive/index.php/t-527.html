<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trysbrina67</div><div class="date">04-08-2002, 03:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">simple<br />
train all your skills, shadowknights have GOOD weapons in all weapon types, unlike some other classes.<br />
plus u never know what you are going to get in the future weapon wise and it sucks to start training a skill at lvl 51.<br />
some examples<br />
1hs - noc blade and sword of pain<br />
2hs - epic, various DN weapons<br />
1hb - moss, ebon mace, stave of shielding<br />
2hb - deathbringers rod<br />
piercing - DN piecers, Narandi's Lance, Shard of Night</div></div><hr />

I recently was awarded a Shard of Night, but my piercing was a lowly 43.  It sure does suck trying to get it maxed out when you are level 52.  The good side is, piercing goes up a lot faster than the 2h skills, due to the low delay.<br />
<br />
I would suggest at the least, getting your 2h skills maxed, as the longer delays on 2h weapons causes them to go up very slowly.</div></div><hr />
