<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nukobbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Subject pretty much sums it up. I have a 58 sk, 54 Dru, 52 Ench and would like some ideas on places that could be decent exp.<br />
<br />
Currently we can clear the SD Plateau, and also keep the Entrance Guards inside Katta from Twilight cleared with time to spare.<br />
<br />
I am wondering if anyone has ideas on places in the planes that this trio could hold.<br />
<br />
I recently came back from a 1 year break (left just before PoP) so alot of the stuff is new to me still. I know from reading the boards that PoP has the best EXP, but from what I have done there with my SK in PoI I think the mobs hit too hard for my druid to keep up with heals till 58 (even with enchanter slowing).<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />
<br />
TIA,<br />

Mobs hit too hard, even when slowed, for the druid to keep up with heals.  Velks would be a good place for that group.</div></div><hr />

I tried POI ent a few times and I can't solo there but that is with SK snare.  With Druid snare and sk fear and all three doing damage you may be able to fear kite their.  Not sure if all mobs under 55 though.<br />
<br />
With SK fear and Druid snare you should be able to take mobs with fear kite that are much too uber for you to take head to head even with slow.  If you do it right when fear runs out the shaman will have agro so mob won't even atk you will slowly walk to shaman while you re-fear.  Not sure exp will be enough to make up for added rish through</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sithanator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would strongly recommend to going to Inner AC, very nice exp and loot at your level. Some other ideas, most of these are better for the chanter and druid then the SK given the current level.<br />

Because I am 3 boxing, dungeon crawls can get  tricky until camp gets setup. Moving all chars can be a little difficult sometimes. Both Dru and Ench have Improved Invis/Camo and I have a Pre-Nerf, so moving places with invis isn't a problem. The fight-move-fight-move is where it gets difficult.<br />
<br />
I am not familiar with &quot;Inner AC&quot; I assume that is refering to Acrylia Caverns. If so I will do a search and see what I can find on that camp.<br />
<br />
I am going to try a few places out tonight and will let you know how it goes.<br />

Yes. Once you zone into AC, take a right, take your second left, go through the gate, follow of left wall. This will leave in front of stair guarded by skeletons that see invis. Kill all skellys in the way, go back invis. follow the hall on top of the stairs until it opens to a large room. Follow right wall and door, up stairs, you see a statue in this room, click on this statue and you be ported to Inner AC.<br />
<br />
Zone out of Inner is the picture on the wall in the balancy room.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>nabolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I two box with my sk 55, and my dad's shaman 54 in pon at the 3tree camps. Pulls are easy. Shaman just slows, cripples and heals. Sk does the rest.<br />
Works very well. Both toons getting 2% per 3 kills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ramgar SK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Set up camp at the safe rock in Plane of Disease.  Invis and lev out to the first island from zone in.  Pull the tetsi flies.  You can fear kite them if you want.  Pretty safe, and good exp up to level 61.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nukobbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Just wanted to post an update on a couple of place I have tried.<br />
<br />
We went and did the flies in PoD and the camp was definatley doable. There were alot of people in and out of the zone, but it seemed that there were always mobs to pull.  <br />
<br />
Also, on a wild hair, I realized that I had not gone to Dragon Necropolis for a while. I figured we would head over and kill the Phase Spiders and see if we could get a PSC for my BL. This camp was very easy, not to mention safe. Setup camp right by zone out and pull spiders as far in as you can go until repop. Even 3 boxing, I would commonly run and tag 2-3 spiders to bring back. The magic resistance was a bit high on the spiders, but with Tash it was not a problem for a 53 enchanter to keep 2 mez'd and everything slowed.<br />
<br />
On a side note, we did get the PSC, and it was refreshing to get some loot from a camp for a change.<br />
<br />
I still haven't gone to Acrylia yet, but plan to try there soon.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>wetwurx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Go into Nurga and set up shop, by sleeping ogre you should have enough mobs till steadly, pull from rooms around if you run out of mobs. Great xp and decent pp ocassional gems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>NorrynNoir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">easiest mobs in pop are in PoJ. there may be a problem of adds with toons below lvl 56 but that 3 box could easily take them assuming you can get them solo, if you get adds, move to poi.<br />
<br />
if you are slowing the mobs in poi you can tank them easy at lvl 58. i was tanking that stuff as early as lvl 52 i believe. PoD flies would also be no problem for you, the rats / goos would also be possible.<br />
<br />
i wouldn't go anywhere but the planes with that trio, get mana regen on everyone and your xp will move nicely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Nukobbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Ok, quick update on Acryllia Caverns:<br />
<br />
We when there and invised up and headed to the skellies towards Inner AC. Along way some of the Grimlings could see invis.  Invis dropped and the Ench and Druid died. They were in the middle of all the mobs.<br />
<br />
So next try we just started clearing our way in. Respawn was slow enough that we could clear pretty large rooms without fear of respawn. 58 SK could pull singles everytime.<br />
<br />
A ton of the mobs are necro casters so instead of hitting the enchanter or druid, they ended up dot'd, but nothing too serious.<br />
<br />
In any case, we never made it to Inner AC. Ended up logging before we got there, but we will go back and try it again later.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>jyaik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Won a three-boxed 51 slaughter this morning in MMC with a 41pally 34 clr and 34 rng. Had ten mins left in regulation. Also took out the two named in there and got a sacrificers grimmoire ac 20 int+8 and a hooded cloak of dark rites or somesuch, damn good loot. These are WAY more fun than reg grind. Your chanter can lull and sk can pull. At your level you may well not win but who cares? Druid can track to named etc.. well worth a try imho I dont have a high enough luller to play with my 61 sk :  (   I would also recommend the furious/vehement room in Nadox, easy single pulls which will, slowly, get you through 59. PoN zone in too is good, druid might possibly keep you alive chaining chloroplast or blast or whichever is the fast 400 heal. If you get an add or cant slow it just zone. Mobs will reset after you zone and not agro your other toons if they have not yet healed you : )</div></div><hr />
