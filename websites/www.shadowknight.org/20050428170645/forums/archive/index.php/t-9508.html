<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aliron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I started the game a little while before kunark, but left a little after sov came out, and thinking of returning<br />
<br />
do you guys know if SOE has purged accounts?<br />
<br />
have a 35 de sk and a 22 halfling war, is it worth grabbing sol or pop yet?  I've been reading up and there's talk about this bazaar in sol...EC's no longer available?<br />
<br />
What's aaxp?<br />
<br />
is the reaver still a viable weapon?  I have one but with all the new toys out there now...<br />
<br />
anythin else I need to know?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aliron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">wait crap wrong forum, lol<br />
<br />
sorry about that one guys</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gwenix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Not sure if you're gonna check back but a reaver is still a nice weapon at the level there are better but since you just came back it's nice. <br />
PoP and Luclin are both very nice to have Luclin has the bazaar so yes EC is pretty much dead and gone and with PoP you can travel almost anywhere in a few minutes.<br />
As for Aaxp it's part of Luclin and if you check the info in game it's fairly self explanitory. Basically tho at 51+ and higher forgot Pop levels you can put a percent of experience towards getting abilities/attribute raises/resists.</div></div><hr />
