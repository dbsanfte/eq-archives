<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Saenayil Shadowraith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ok, im level 60 atm, and have all my spells up to 62.<br />
<br />
I was going to go straight to 62/65 as I got the spells for each level. The other day I was discussing AA's with a friend and was told you get a new table for AA xp post 60 (starting at level 61). Now i wanna know... should I get my defensive AA's at level 60 while it is supposedly easier, or should i stick to my old plan of just going to level 62/65?<br />
<br />
Please keep in mind I'm on a server with expansions only up to PoP, so the places i XP in are PoS, PoV, and PoJ. Xp at PoJ has weakened a lot so im only there when in line for groups.<br />
<br />
thanks in advance for information on this. I hope i posted this in the right forum.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Other classes I might tell so stop to pick up different class altering AA's, but SK's have none of those.<br />
<br />
also, your level and it's relation to the level of the MOb is involved in so many in game calculations like whether you hit and how much you hit for, whether a MOb resists your spell, whether you resist a MOb's spell, whether a MOb hits you and for how much.<br />
<br />
No single AA effects all that + opens up recommended/required gear, give you more HP, etc.<br />
<br />
In general levels first then AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Saenayil Shadowraith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">k, thanks, was just wondering if i should get my defensive AA's before going back to leveling, i guess right now i will just do regular levels in tier2, and AA xp in PoJ for however long it lasts. If anyone else has input would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Saenayil Shadowraith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">currently we have been receiving some support, and there is word spreading around about a possible LoY coming out for us. I will be very happy if this is true as I remember my shared banks, and I miss them. Anyways, we are finally receiving attention and some members are sending in apps for the new guide program they just set up for the server. Things are looking up for al'kabor.</div></div><hr />

If you don't have LDoN where you lose substantial points by not being 65 I would say it depends on what your play time, zone availability, and gear is like.<br />
<br />
Levels are &gt; AA for the fastest gain.  However, if you have good gear, you are a non raider, and have a regular group I would stay 62 (if you only do pick up groups, not sure how much they would pass you over in those early zones based on level) since nothing in BoT, HoH, and tactics will give you a problem with good gear and all your defensive AAs once you get there.  Then you can level up in there as you gain your 63-64 spells. <br />
<br />
Is BoT, HoH, and Torment open to you or is that still key only as a function of being opened during LoY I think it was.  I would work on the alt entry quests if they are closed....even if they are only 1/person, because I don't think that change was made until LoY either, they are not that bad.  I would suggest starting with the Tactics key since that is the easiest to get for a number of people since you hunt in the same place, and offers you a way to camp for ornate and 63/64 spells.<br />
<br />
How far along are they in PoP changes? Did they nerf enchanter charm?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Arikash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm gonna go ahead and disagree with you Lynxal, there is NO reason for a SK to stay at lvl 62.<br />
<br />
Also, you make BoT/HoH sound like the things quad for 800, with decent gear, and no AA's, he could prolly tank BoT at 62, I did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">With a decent cleric and slower, anyone can tank in BoT. A 62 SK would have no problems at all, though if your server is anything like mine, trying to get into BoT or HoH at 62 with a group was a joke, because everyone was all about the &quot;OMG ur not 65 laff ur not leet im leet OMGZ go away im better then you!&quot;. Do what you feel is best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Arikash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ha, I got lucky, I was in a tight-knit guild, and they were sick and tired of shitty ass tanks that couldn't hold aggro!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Fallgore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Okay, here is what I plan to do:<br />
First thought:<br />
Hit 63, get all spells for 60-63 as well as up to 65.<br />
Go to BoT for aa, get ALL Defensive Aa's first  IMO cause that helps more in the long run incase you're not uber w/hp heh.<br />
After Defensive Aa's, go for Offensive.<br />
<br />
From Offensive, while going for those, get Class Aa's, first would go for the leech one, Imroved HT, then the horse; like a free sow + sow lol,,,, <br />
<br />
OR<br />
<br />
Hit 65, have all spells, etc.<br />
Go to WoS and get aa exp until you get all the defensive first, offensive w/class, and then pop stuff heh.<br />
<br />
That is my plan atm, and Defensive is THE Best way to go, and I got 4 lvl 70 (others close to 70) Sks I have known for a loooong time and they say Defensive first cause while getting the offensive first, that doesn't help as much because their reason is that you cannot getting better at melee like them, and you need all the protection you can get, so I am ganna go w/what they say, and 2 of'em who made Warrios liked Defensive first as well *grin* cause they got more dmg avoidence and stuff.<br />
<br />
Just what I would advise, but anyone can flame me  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Croix VorAbaddon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'd say, get to a point where you can tank the Stormriders in BoT decently, level and gear-wise. Then stop, and pick up CA3, CS3, PE, ND3, in that order. Then, continue leveling. Class changing AA's? No, but they make things easier. If you use a two hander, 2H Bash is a decent pick up as well. Doesn't land often, and the damage is puny, but when it does land, it could be the one that interrupts that annoying CHeal on a nasty mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Saenayil Shadowraith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I already know what AA's i want, thats not the issue. I know I will probably get the defensives first, the SCF3, ToL, anything that will help with spell crits and self healing. I also want good AA's for PVP, 2hb being one of them, Uber HT being the other :). I Think i will go to 62 then get all my defensives, and after i get the defensives go straight to 65 where I will gain more of the class ability's and esspecially the HT for 1 on 1 PVP :D<br />
<br />
thanks for all the help, I have made up my mind, for those of you wondering why I am picking 62, tis because 62 gives me the new LT and Zef which are both great, along with  61 having festering darkness making PoV soloing that much easier :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>makaky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Get to 65 before anything else then work on the fun stuff<br />
<br />
<br />
you: /ooc 62 SK lfg<br />
<br />
not you: /ooc 65 sk lfg<br />
<br />
who do you think they gonna pick ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Saenayil Shadowraith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">not gonna happen, theres 3 SK's above 60 on server, and your lucky to see them LFG, one is in the big raiding guild, his only time playing is mostly during raids, so yeah there is almost no SK competition :) not much to worry about, Im sure i have what I want figured out, thanks again for all the info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>onurknees</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">63-65 warrior, pallie, sk &gt; 62 <br />
<br />
sks arent ur only competition ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Arikash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">And in BoT(on windows servers atleast) some people will prefer a 63 ber vs a 62 sk, cuz they're all retards.</div></div><hr />
