<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Laronx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a question about illusion potions. Has anyone used them to do GM yet? If so how did it work out? Do they make your faction good enough to turn in knives and bone chips, or can you do the whole quest by using them? I don't know very much about illusions, if you give an item to raise faction while you have an illusion on, do you actually get that faction?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jabbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">From the way I understand it, the potion only helps slightly.  Iksar illusions will certainly increase your faction over what you'd have as a non-iksar, but you'll still need to do a little bit of faction work.  Mainly I believe they're used so people don't have to raise the necromancer faction to non-kos.  The necro's aren't directly involved in the quest, but they are right next to a few of the folks who are.  The Ikky potions just reduce the amount of faction you have to do.<br />
<br />
Personally, i just went ahead and did all the factioning.  It doesn't really take all that long.  Just go to places like OT and kill sarnaks while you're xp'ing up.  That'll raise your Iksar Warrior faction high enough to do Knives and Bone Chips (although you have to keep an eye on the Crusaders wandering around while handing in chips).</div></div><hr />

My Ogre (Rallos) had &quot;cannot possibly get better&quot; faction, but was only indifferent, so no greenmist for me.    But now with illusion potions, I go from high indifferent to low amiable, and I did all the turnins up to the Lord of Pain</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sepcieulus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I used them on every turn in.<br />
<br />
As stated above ... I was max faction(indifferent) with everything cept for necros ... which I was still KoS to.<br />
<br />
Potion took me to amiable with all and dubious to necros ... enough to do the quest.</div></div><hr />

Actually, you have to do turn ins to the Librarian, who is in fact on Necro faction.  <br />
<br />
Personally, I'm with you though, Jabbuk, I did the faction and am glad I did.  I can bank and sell in Cab, I can walk anywhere unmolested, and best of all, I now have a replacement city in kunark for when I get around to waxing my VS faction.<br />
<br />
Not to mention that Cab is just damned convenient as a &quot;pass through zone.&quot;<br />
<br />
There are a couple threads here on easy necro faction, as well, so don't skimp on it.  They may not be the most.... ethical of methods, but they get the job done with a minimum of actual boredom.</div></div><hr />

Make sure you are in a spot where you can aggro all 3 iksar, and go AFK.  Easy necro faction while you sleep etc...</div></div><hr />
