<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Katollos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys, I was wondering if anyone had a good plan on how to do 25-65.  I haven't done it in like 2 years so I'm sorta out of the loop.  Both the SK and the shaman have fungis, and besides the fungis they are moderately equiped.  I am not 2 boxing, I'm leveling with my brother, if that makes any difference.  We've tried Netherbian and HHK but NL seems slow and HK is over camped.  Any ideas would be greatly appreciated, thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kromglon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Probably could do Sola pretty soon, if not now then in a few levels. Maybe 29 when the shaman gets invis or clear past the stupid goblins at the start. I hear you can stay there till 44 or so. Check out unrest too good xp bonus not sure about duoing it been awhile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>nabolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">from 30 to about 45  I did the guards in HHK, using shaman for buffs. Bad faction is the only problem with killing the guards there tho. Great money for that level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bloodmere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">25-30 Paw, good exp modifier, empty zone, lots of mobs<br />
<br />
30-39 Gulf of Gunthak, the beach, lots of undeads, non-stop pulling as long as you want to.<br />
<br />
39-44 Gulf of Gunthak at the fort, closely spawned mobs, just work your way round the fort killing as fast as you can. <br />
<br />
44- 49 Dulak entrance and the first boats (and get the Shaman his Stoicism)<br />
<br />
49-55 Plane of Justice, Jail area and beoynd<br />
<br />
55-60 Plane of Disease, Plane Of Nightmare. Or Nadox, or Torgiran Mines<br />
<br />
60-65 PoV undeads or Torgiran mines, 60-61 Fungus grove</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Katollos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've heard that the LoY mobs have a ton of hp, does their xp make up for it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bloodmere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have been switching between PoD/PoN and Nadox/Torgiran while  levelling up my shaman slave. The time it takes me to take down a Broken skull guard in Torgiran is about the same time in above mentioned PoP zones so if you are ok in PoP, LoY wont dissapoint you. Only hassle is that the LoY mobs are a  bit harder to get too, but I am usually alone or close to that in the zone, so non-stop pulling is standard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ketamina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Just wanted to say thanks for the tips, Bloodmere. I have not leveled up a character in over a year, and recently started playing again, and have come up short trying to think of different places to go besides the overcrowded areas like HK. It's funny how you can play for so long and forget the good areas if you take a long break. I use MacroQuest too though, which will give the bonuses for each zone when there is one.<br />
<br />
One area I look forward xp'ing in when I reach the late 40's is the furie islands in Ocean of Tears (I think that's the right zone...my memory isn't what it used to be). Decent xp, I can't remember if there's an actual bonus, but very good plat/loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've done the leveling sk/sham thing as well.<br />
The best place to go is overthere at your level for two reasons, one the xp is good (there is better though) but the most important reason is you can save up all of them sarnak war braids so you can get your sk to abiable and get a GATE OVERTHERE HAMMER!<br />
<br />
The gate overthere hammer is the prime requirement when duoin with a sham because it makes short work to return to you bind point.<br />
<br />
Its a must have, its great, get it now dont wait, make sure the moment you hit 50 you can use it!<br />
<br />
From that point your adventuring times are not limited by you having to make sure you have enough time to get back.<br />
<br />
Shaman loads up gate, you pull a mob, sham sends in ruppy puppy then just waits till the hammer goes off, then he easily gates out whilst ruppie puppie is tanking the mob.<br />
<br />
After that it gets hard, 30 - 47 is a pain, but LoY is great for that level range, specially if you can get to dulaks, the cash is good enough to fit out any slots you may be missing.<br />
<br />
at 47 you can go to pop, probably need to group a bit first, then watch the xp fly.<br />
<br />
*Tip! Get a j-stick (proc tash) for the SK when you get to POP. those suckers allow you to lower MR enough for a shaman to malxxxxx and land slow, will allow you to slow at lower levels and get more groups.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Syltan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Grarg has good point regarding Gate/OT hammer.  It is very useful.  I would highly recommend it for DC'ing to curb travel times after hunting.  <br />
<br />
One small note, in order to use it though, you do not have to pull/fight a mob.  You can 'duel' your shammy until the gate proc goes off.  <br />
<br />
The reason I mention it is b/c if you are in safe area, it is an alternative low risk way of using Hammer if you are deep in a zone or nearby other grps that you don't want to leave mob near.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>wetwurx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Head over to CC around 30 r so once you can invis and start on orc and work your way up to geos. Great xp and loot down there as well as merchants and a bank in house. Gunthak is okay but Dulak is much better, would guess late 40's maybe, have never 2-boxed.  Go there and set up shop on a boat, wavecrasher i think is easiest. God loot  and xp again. You will also need a few drops for shaman HoT. Lizard blood and something fom the bar i forget.  Need drops from luggald caves for SK spells but wouldnt recomend that till later as its a pain.   Nadox zone inside temple is also a nice place to set up for a duo.  Nurga and AC fun too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Lizarde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If you're after fast-track exp, I'd head to Sol A at 25 or so, especially since you've both got fungis.  The exp there is lightning fast until your low-40s if you decide to go from killing goblins to killing gnomes.  You'll ruin your Ak'anon faction, for what it's worth, but the exp is extremely fast.<br />
<br />
From your low 40s to level 50 or 51, head to the City of Mist.  The mobs will be dark blue until 49 or 50, and they have both low DPS (max hit ~120 for entrance mobs, often less) and low HPs (around 1200 to 1600 for the entrance mobs, a joke).  With your pet and the SK pet and haste for everyone, you'll be killing very fast.  Plus, your shaman gets his pages for his epic quest.  You can get a decent wrist and waist items for your SK from the Ravenous War Boned Skeleton, and a MoSS from the Mighty Golem, both rare-ish spawns that are only slightly tougher than the average entrance mob.<br />
<br />
After that, get LDoN groups, the adventure points aren't so bad at 51 (11 to 13 per win I think) and the exp and coin are okay.  You have a good start for a group with the SK/shaman combo.  Build up your points and you can start looking for armor upgrades from the merchants, along with any augments or items that you manage to get in the dungeons themselves.</div></div><hr />
