<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Braellar</div><div class="date">10-30-2002, 04:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1.) pets are now indifferent to NPC.<br />
     Meaning that when you run around a zone only you will gain agro not the pet, usefull for all pet owners... makes the air pet kinda useless with it's invis though.<br />
<br />
2.) if you and a pet are up at same time - only you will generate agro<br />
     This means if you FD nothing will agro your or your pet.<br />
<br />
So this leads to some nice situations.<br />
<br />
Ok i was playing around with velk's castle the other night and we didnt have a rogue so i was unbuffed due to those annoying traps.<br />
<br />
What i would do and have seemed to work out now is:<br />
 /pet guard here<br />
 Go pull a bunch of sentinals with bad pathing 5-6<br />
 FD, pet would attack the one that hit me and would engage just before the door.<br />
 All the other sentinals would walk back to spawn - ignoreing my pet... they let my pet beat on one sentinal and walked past it and back to there spawn point allowing somone to tag and even allowing me to stand and lure back to group on ones that had reset.<br />
<br />
Even better is my pet was holding agro so they could slow, tash, debuff and lure it into group while my pet holds it.<br />
<br />
Sure now some of you are saying &quot;what use is this to me&quot; but it lets you do some easyer splits are lower lvs where you cannot get snare to land, splitting things in kael for lower lvs can be a lot easyer now..... and even a necromancer can do this with his suped up pet.<br />
<br />
Now i might add think of pain in ass mobs like...... Queen/King in chardok...... YES this does work and i have done it, though they went through two necro pets, one sk and one shaman first.<br />
 Basically we guarded pets sat in aoe range, somone taged the sarnack aoe his us they backed out of range (mob not in range to agro) pets attacked mob - mob chewed through all pets until all the other mobs had reset - mob runs to us single... no adds.<br />
<br />
So it can be of use in a few situations if you are aware of it, this went in when they made pets indifferent... i have noticed some odd activities with aoe and pet agro and went through variouse simulations last night with pets and agro and FD and splitting/pulling etc, this all works.<br />
<br />
Enjoy<br />

Pets are indiff, but Only if they arent fighting one of the mob's friends.<br />
The velks situation above would result in all mobs turning on the pet.<br />
<br />
also, if you are agrod the pet helps. Once you FD, the pet still fights and has mobs attention.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A while ago that statement is true - but that is not what happens anymore.<br />
<br />
In ever single situation my pet is attacking a mob and it's friends just walk by (i am FD by the way) and do not assist and attack my pet, once the mobs get back to there spawn somone tags from my pet etc...... same as snare splitting in essence.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why would you post something like this. If ya like this skill you will delete this post.<br />
<br />
Does not mean that much to me personally. If you dont like it - dont use it, quite frankly i can land a snare on anything i need to split - and anything that resists the snare is extreemly capable of takeing my 58 pet down before the others are out of add range anyway.<br />

This is the case for all the pet classes I play (SK, BST, Shaman, Mage, Enchanter).<br />

If you have found a location that does otherwise, then you have likely found a bug in the program (be prepared for warning, suspension or banning).</div></div><hr />

<br />
On top of that, any mob that hits slightly hard will tear through your pet in under 2 s econds, which only makes it useful in situations where pulling is already not a challenge.</div></div><hr />

Not to mention that the pet will poof after a very short sustained fd, even if it's not fighting.</div></div><hr />

I did the exact same tests yesterday and yes mobs do not assist the pet once engaged.  However, you must be FD first before the pet engages the mob.  This worked in PoN, PoI, PoJ.  This  post by no means replaces Dark splitting but its still a viable alternative for advanced pulling techniques.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not exactly clear what you're saying.<br />
<br />
Pull, make sure I don't get hit/make sure pet doesn't attack, fd, then send pet after one?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Braellar</div><div class="date">10-30-2002, 11:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">mobs do not assist the pet once engaged.<br />
<br />
Thats what i am saying.....<br />
<br />
You dont even have to Feign..... try it on greens, works a treat.<br />
<br />
As i said in my 2nd post, any time you can use this Snare splitting is going to be better and faster, safer and a ton easyer... but this is something to keep in mind even if you are just lazy on mana.<br />
<br />
On a side note my 58 pet was tanking a velk sentinal for a good 20 odd seconds, thought the cleric threw a heal on my pet and suprising the sentinal would not go for the cleric /cheer pet.<br />
<br />
when the other mobs got past the door, they started nukeing it and it refused to move from pet, so sent the warrior in to smack it around, /pet back off and pulled it over. <br />
<br />
The only thing this really works a treat on is Chardok queen, park a few pets up the ramp get hit by aoe and charge her, she will melee pet after pet after pet and once all pets dead will run up ramp single /shrug.<br />
<br />
Not like a bunch of 65's would trival her so bad anyway.<br />

<br />
However, I just recall last few times i was lvlin at hole before I quit that my pet did have only one on him while I was fd... <br />

Didn't care much about it, but now it all makes sense now . :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Warmaster Xsavuung Llaahh</div><div class="date">10-30-2002, 01:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I first read this, I though it was total BS. But thinking back to what I've been doing lately, it's true. I haven't used it in the same way, but this shown me other uses of the &quot;non-aggro&quot; pets.<br />
<br />
What I've been doing is soloing the entrance mobs to Chardok. These are easily fear-kitable from the entrance down just past the second corner. My problem was aggroing the next spawned mobs on the initial break-up. What I would do is pull my pet off and turn and go back to the zone in and let the sarnak come back to me /rinse-repeat. WHat I discovered is that if I didn't get to close to the static spawns, I would not get aggro, but my pet could continue to beat on it (aggroed still on me from damage/fear/snare) and would never get touched.<br />
<br />
As long as the mob has not hit you, the pet will NOT aggro any friends of the mob.</div></div><hr />

<br />
this has worked like this since the pet changes a while ago to make them more raid/crowd control friendly<br />
<br />
and what is the point of having a message board if you can't share tips and tricks of the trade such as this, without having a bunch of people crying &quot;soe is gunna nerf it since you posted it, please delete it&quot;  I dont know why you care ttoth, you already have claimed to have quit your 53 sk in favor of your warrior<br />
<br />
some people read message boards for exactly this kind of help, we all arent here to read your pissy cry baby whine fests.  if thats all you want posted on a message board, you might as well reach up for the big delete key.</div></div><hr />

It's kind of neat, good vs casters...only ok vs other mobs....this skill is about as nerfable as using levitate  to lower aggro radiuses of mobs (because the z-axis adds to the radius total....) ....i.e. very skill based, and anything but guaranteed.<br />
<br />
It a neat skill....just like reaggroing mobs  that didn't forget you when you feigned  by moving back into &quot;kunark aggro&quot; radius while invis.  Also a nifty trick, but not awesome.  It's not &quot;abusable&quot;.  What it IS is yet another nifty method of pulling available to sks.<br />
<br />
Oh, and add siren's grotto to the list of tested areas...;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goola</div><div class="date">10-30-2002, 03:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's something I noticed a few weeks ago with my necro while in ME. I was pulling gatherers and I know for a fact that the gorangas help each other, mean little freaks !<br />
Well anyway, someone tried pulling a scout from the rock camp near the fort with the 4-arms and ended up training to DS zone. There was a group near the zone and the gorangas aggroed them as well, so I decided to snag one of the scouts. I cast dot, snared it, sent pet and as I started to cast fear I noticed the other group had zoned and the rest of the gorangas were coming at me, so I immediately FD and they were almost to melee range. I figured they would jump on my pet and destroy it, but instead they started walking back to their miserable little camp... then I thought &quot;oh cool&quot; so as long as the mob I was killing was feared it would not &quot;call on his friends for help&quot;. So I decided to stand up and sure enough the gorangas start coming at me again, so I quickly re-feared the one I was killing and immediately FD. Same result, they just turned around and started walking back. This time I waited until they were at their camp and stood up right when fear broke, goranga was near death and all was ok.<br />
I guess I just like it when things go ok.<br />

<br />
It's about as &quot;exploit&quot; as feign pulling.   I mean, come on, feigning over and over and over again?  Isn't that just taking advantage of the poor ai????? Exploit? No.  Not as defined in the eula.<br />
<br />
Oh wait, perhaps it's as exploitable as using pathing....no, not the actual &quot;mob can't get there&quot; use, which IS an exploit, but the &quot;mob is sure taking the long way to get there&quot; use of pathing.  Exploit? No.  Not as defined in the eula.<br />
<br />
Mobs not aggroing a pet when you are feigned?  Well the mob that the pet aggros is certainly aggroed.  Since this tactic doesn't actually cause a player to a)get experience quicker, or b) get experience safer, or c) have a no risk method of exp gain......<br />
Exploit? No.  Not as defined in the eula.</div></div><hr />
