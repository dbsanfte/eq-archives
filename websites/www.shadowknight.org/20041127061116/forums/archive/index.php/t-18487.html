<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>BrikBludgaard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">-Endurance pool for hybrids is lower than melee pools, but not so miniscule as to be worthless.<br />
-Hybrids get one &quot;opportunity&quot; ability to use endurance with, while melee have many.<br />
(for instance, Shadowknight opportunity should be a melee damage or perhaps a mini-harmtouch.. paladin opportunity should be in line with their protective nature, and perhaps the ranger one is a &quot;point-blank-shot&quot;.. beastlord should be a savage swipe fo soime sort)<br />
-Hybrids disciplines are not only brought to the endurance pool for cost and recast, but they are retuned to actually be worth using. (Knight disciplines especially)<br />
<br />
<br />
Considerations:<br />
-Warriors will undoubtedly be doing more damage overall due to the newabilties.  Shadowknights currently outdamage Warriors by about 10% overall sustainable due to spells...  if the warriors close that gap, what advantage do Shadowknights hold?  Especially since warriors are also being given &quot;utility&quot; and &quot;taunt&quot; with their opportunity attacks.<br />
-Looks like warriors are getting a 5% bonus to mitigation off the top.  Not a bad plan really... but perhaps the knights should get the 5% and the warriors 10%?<br />
-Shields STILL need a looksee...  warriors and knights should have more use for shields than they currently hold... many ideas for improving them have been discussed... pick one?<br />
<br />
<br />
Now don't get me wrong, I am happy about the possible changes...  as melee in general has needed a looksee for awhile.<br />
However, the last time such a &quot;balancing&quot; was done, the spellcasters not only lost ground, but became useless except for buff pure melee, and the hybrids got double whammied into &quot;log your knight so you can play this warrior&quot; status.<br />
<br />
Here's hopin...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Inquestion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A shield block skill would be nice, as well as a furious bash-ish AA.<br />
Maybe they could top it off by a putting nice aggro proc like enraging blow on a common drop or quested one hander for Pallies and SK's so we all don't have to go out and buy BoC's... That would be nice, heh.</div></div><hr />

It sucks channeling through a 1.8 second or 1.9 second cast on incoming, before a mob is slowed.<br />
It's gotten to the point where I spear twice instead of trusting my channeling abilities on a Fear on inc.<br />
<br />
Just saying it'd be cool to have a decent weapon with a strong aggro proc if they ever do make shields worth using.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Deadalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Why would you want to rely on the RNG for agro with all the agro spells sks have? Having to wait sometimes 5-6 sec for a proc is ten times worse than getting your 1.8 sec spell interrupted. Though I can see how a sk wouldn't realize this, always having agro spells and never relying on procs in their life. The grass probably seems greener as ya watch a warrior proc EB on incoming on a bunch of mobs, but don't forget that on most mobs, the EB will NOT proc on incoming and that warrior's stuck there praying for the RNG to smile on them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Synapticus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The past rationale for SK to have lower weapon and offensive skills as compared to warriors was that we traded off some of that for our spells/utility/versatility.  Now that warriors will have an increase in utility and versatility, I hope that they bump up our weapon skills to at least 240 and offense to 252.</div></div><hr />
