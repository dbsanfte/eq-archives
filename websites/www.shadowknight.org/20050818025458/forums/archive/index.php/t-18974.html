I have soloed at lot in Lower Guk but it becomeing much slower now.  If I push the envelope I risk death.<br />
<br />
I have hunted in Kaesora, Lower Guk, Dawnshroud, Overthere, Stonebrunt and Jaggedpine Forest but I have not found a zone I really like.  <br />
<br />
Overthere and Stonebrunt seem slow and are not much of a challange (i like dungean crawling) but I really don't want to die much more right now.  I have been doing well in Jaggedpine with a bard but when she's not arround what can I solo there?  or what zones and more to the point MoBs should I be shooting for?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You have to slaughter greens as they will all aggro, and the Shammy/Wizzie types see invis.  So do the gnome robots, but they are good to kill for exp and loot anyway.  Make your way to the hallway where the Charred Guardian shield drops (eqatlas has a good map). <br />
<br />
 The mobs are split by distance, drop good plat and FS loot, and you can quickly and painlessly work your way back and forth up and down this hallway.  Sol A has a HUGE experience bonus, and I found that blues and even light blues were still giving good experience.<br />
<br />
It was a safe and easy solo 40, with the only hassles being all the heavy FS loot, and the annoying goblin slaughter to get in and out.<br />
<br />
 (and I gave away 4 Charred Guardian Shields and 1 Charred Guardian Breastplate to Nektulos noobs, which was satisfying in itself, although watching the lore bp's rot was not).<br />
