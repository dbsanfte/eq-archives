I was hunting yesterday with my shaman at the king tree I think it was called. We got a ton of idols, hammers, and even some spells off the 4 arms but nothing grodanish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alontier</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 03:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've had Grodan's Idol drop from<br />
Cotarie Centurion and Cotarie Legionnaire (Vampires)<br />
and Strength of Grodan from<br />
Umbrous Toilers pretty often. (Black small aliens)<br />
<br />
I guess you were hunting at the Chief tree but I don't think<br />
those Gorangas drop anything useful for a SK. You should go<br />
after Toilers, Cotarie, Xi, Vi and Xin.<br />
<br />
Good luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Walil</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 03:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually for my first time in the zone I did really well. The goranga idol dropped enough that my shaman and my sk got one. It was a nice upgrade for her to replace the runed bone fork for when resists aren't important. My shaman also scored plague of insects (which I can't use quite yet). <br />
<br />
Thanks for the tip on the aliens though. I'll have to check them out. After I get the axe I think I'll bail on the zone. It feels too much like DL part 2 and the exp isnt that great at level 52.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For good Xp in 52 you could do bats and beetles in SolB or Scarlet desert.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On a sidenote:  where/what does Grodan's Flowing Cloak drop off of?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Walil</div><div class="date">04-04-2002, 02:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ack that sucks if the axe has been moved. I did get the idol from a group doing vamps last night so that still drops. Guess I'll have to save up for a weapon upgrade then.</div></div><hr />

that spawns at the top of the building in the lake at the northwest corner.<br />
<br />
He's pretty easy but the trouble is splitting him from the rest of the mobs in that building.<br />
I usually use a DA pally to train them all out and tag the Xi Thall off him.<br />
It's a train of 20 mobs or so and most are Clerics or SK's.</div></div><hr />

Verant changed the drop on the Strength of Grodan...it doesn't drop in ME anymore. only drops in Akheva now. :( <br />
<br />
SoG does still drop in ME, seen 2 on the Battlemaster in the past 2 weeks or so.  <br />
