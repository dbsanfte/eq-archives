<br />
Female Human Shadowknight follower of Bertox.<br />
<br />
So, what id like to ask is any advice from other Human SK bertox followers? Is Cult armor harder to get because we are rare? how about faction to train in Overthere? Neriak? I noticed at least one guy in Neriak Foriegn Quarter was Threatneing to me at the start.<br />
<br />
How about the Innoruks Curse? Darkforge armor? Any other quest related pitfalls I need to know about? General info? <br />
<br />
Thanks for the information and guidence many of you gave to me up to this point and thanks to those that will continue.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kahntun Derstand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Heya Glin.  I thought I'd point you to the Search button in the upper right corner before some meany does it in a much harsher way.  It's a great source of information.<br />
<br />
Welcome to the class!  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ostracized</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thank you for the advice but I did :) Found little to no info about the Bertox follower SK. maybe thats a good thing and means it plays exactly like any other Human SK but i figured i would ask.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Moonnyt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">For the cultural armor , the only bump in the road may be to find a Bertox Cleric to imbue. I would check EQtraders.com and look for a smith on your server. If all else fails you can always level up your own Bertox Cleric to level 29 ( I think that's the level) to supply the GM Smith. Oh , and Welcome :)<br />
<br />
edit: don't train in Neriak till you have invis to Undead. I think the ghouls will attack you. once you Invis vs Undead then just run past them and train. You can also train in the SK guild in East Freeport, The overthere , Ak'anon , and Echo Caverns. (others will add if I forgot anything)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cerena Gloomheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">HELLO FELLOW ENTHROPIST!!<br />
<br />
To answer some of your questions as a fresh Shadowknight serving Bertoxx:<br />
<br />
--The difficulty getting the armor is as hard as getting any other newbie armor.  Except there might be a little difficulty getting whatever bits and pieces you need from Qeynos Hills.  Holly's going to be stalking you (but come lvl 35 and you can go back there and fear kite her for every time she's killed you ^_^)<br />
<br />
--Factionwise, you're about equal KOS in the world as any &quot;good&quot; character is.  We can go in Neriak just fine, but don't bother with Oggok and Grobb:  They just want you in a pot of stew.  You'll be surprised at the places you can travel (You're probably going to be dubious, but it's still safe travel.  Con everything just in case).  You will be fine in OT as well.<br />
<br />
--As for quest related mishaps:  There is nothing different about you that other Shadowknights have to go through for your quests (When you go hunt Darkforge, though, watch out for the ogre guard by the CZ isle entrance!)<br />
<br />
Anyways:  Best of luck to you, fellow enthropist~!  Follow the path of bertoxxulous and let all those who oppose you decay and rot!  ^.^  Send a PM if you have any further questions!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was dubious as human innoruuk to kelethin and felwithe. Not sure about Gnome faction beforehand since I was getting -GemChoppers in sol a for metalite for darkforge pieces.<br />
Dwarfs I'm pretty sure I was KoS the whole time, don't quite remeber.<br />
/shrug maybe I'm just sexier :cool:<br />
<br />
Of course 3 kills into my first PoG raid ever buh bye.<br />
<br />
<br />
And yah synn our armor is pretty fugly(inny).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Maelmordha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Congratulations, you have taken one of the roads less traveled. Your early life will be quite hard, the folk surrounding Qeynos hate us with good reason.<br />
<br />
The gnolls of Blackburrow our &quot;allies&quot; are your enemies.<br />
The Barbarians of Halas and Everfrost and West Karana will kill you on sight.<br />
The Erudites of Paineel will kill you on site as well.<br />
Even in our home town we must be careful not to get too close to the paladin and cleric guild.<br />
<br />
You will be able to enter Neriak but dont expect to be much liked at first.<br />
<br />
Grobb and Oggok are KOS to you.<br />
Faydwer is KOS to you, including most of Akanon I think.<br />
<br />
Bertox is the most hated god in the game as far as faction goes.<br />
Freeport is not KOS.<br />
<br />
I would quest your newbie armor in the Qhills area and be glad that you have such a fine quest to do. Once you reach your 15th season I would consider heading to Paludal Caverns for excellent experience. If you cannot head to the moon, I would travel to either the Warrens or to the Freeport area.<br />
<br />
The posters above were right about the low numbers of Priests of the Plague lord as well, when the time comes you will have to seek one out for the special armor.<br />
<br />
I play a 48th season Shadow Knight on the FV server. It has been a lot of fun and is a great change of pace from the Hate, Fear, or Glory seeking fanatics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Rhone Darkarrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">&quot;course the wholesale slaughter of those fucks is fun at high lvl now&quot;<br />
<br />
I dont know why, but this line just slew me, guess it just hits close to home :)<br />
<br />
Bertox as an sk would be tough in the old world, but really, once you get up to lv 20 or so, you can ditch the old world and hit luclin, velious, and pop locations...damn the faction.  <br />
<br />
As far as cultural armor difficulty goes, you shouldnt have any problems with it, tons of humans making the heraldic stuff.  Now, I play a rallos zek ogre sk, and you wanna talk about some hard armor to find....yeesh  Crimson Darkscale is about as rare as it gets, but for my money it cant be beat.  And besides, its that wonderful dark red color that the firce heraldic stuff is, people think im a warrior :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ostracized</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Great info all.<br />
<br />
About the armor. it is called Fetid right? Is it no drop? Just incase i cannot find anyone at the WAY WAY long time away level to get Cultural (looked at EQtraders, nice armor for the Bertox follower!) id be nice o be able to buy it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Klax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Bertoxx owns, humans own, i've never had many faction problems besides grobb/oggok/kaladim/rivervale/Halas (and let me tell you, with NO sarcasm what-so-ever *ha* that these zones are MEGA IMPORTANT)<br />
<br />
im dubious pretty much everywhere that could be considered a problem (kelethin and felwithe, till i slaughtered in PoG and lost all that faction in felwithe, im still ok in kelethin-- like it matters), grow up in qeynos and you will be non-kos to every druid and ranger in the karanas and westward thanks to gnolls, (cept holly windstalkhoe and the rangers outside the WC ring-- like they matter) Also you are fine in ak'anon, as their SKs and necros must worship bertoxx so they will be nonkos-- and i WOULD be non-kos in halfer-town, but i kinda... killed... the injured halfling back in the day cuz i thought he had a key out of that damned cell in najena...oh and even though freeport sucks, you are quite nonkos there, dubious at the very worst (paladins/clerics/casters)<br />
<br />
Things to Remember--<br />
-Innoruuk is a gimp<br />
-freeport is for wussies,<br />
-qeynos rules<br />
-bertoxx rules<br />
-bloodsabres rule<br />
-factions that are kos to you basically do not know how much ass you are capable of kicking, so ignore them (except iksars, iksars are cool--greenmist is a signature blade even if you arent one of those scaled CT worshippers imo)<br />
<br />
That is about it, above all qeynos rules, even paladins from qeynos are cool, it's pretty much default<br />
<br />
sadly the qeynos badge quest to show your elite qeynos heritage will lower your faction with the bloodsabres and corrupt guards, so stay away from that</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>neferaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I'm curious, what did you put points in as a human SK? I did 20 in agi but I wish I put them all in int :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Dohn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Most people regret putting points in anything save for Stamina, in the late game.<br />
<br />
And yes, I am one of the few remaining Qeynos devotes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kaotik Von'Damon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Think its great when folks try race/class combos they like and not what everyone else is doing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Minta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I am also a human, bertoxx SK.  Starting points I put a bunch in stamina and then put maybe 5 in some other random stat, like AGI for some reason.  The key is you want all your melee stats above 75 and the rest in Stamina. <br />
<br />
Anyway, as for being KoS... this shouldn't really be a problem. Like other people have posted, it's the REALLY good aligned places that hate you, and of course... druids hate you.  Surprisingly, I found I was only dubious in Felwithe at the start.  <br />
<br />
I skipped out on the whole blackburrow train-station fun and went straight to the warrens for those middle years. That gets your faction up with Paineel and the GUARDS in Erudin. The clerics and paladins in Erudin will still hate your guts, obviously... <br />
<br />
I don't think I was KoS to Neriak ever. There is that one guard at the bar in the foreign quarter who is threatening for some reason, but he's pretty low level.  The ghouls in the necro section were KoS too.<br />
<br />
Freeport was not a problem. I didn't ever go searching out the dwarf guy or that drunk high elf paladin chick, but... they're in one building in West Freeport that's easily avoided.<br />
<br />
The temple of Solusek Ro which is where you do DF armor quests is indifferent to everyone at the start, even Iksar, for all the good it does them.<br />
<br />
I think you start at dubious with the outpost in OT. It is on VS faction, and so are those ogres on the stop-over island for the boat in Timorous Deep.<br />
<br />
That having been said... you are now free to ruin your faction as you see fit. Personally I found no use for being non-KoS in feydwer, so I killed a few elves here and there, hunted in PoG eventually, etc.  I would NOT suggest killing orcs in CB or gfay as it ruins your faction with the Dark Elf warrior guild, which could cause you problems if you ever want to go there.<br />
<br />
I trashed my faction with VS, so now I'm KoS in the OT outpost, but I figured it was a good tradeoff for being able to hunt in KC and HS. Plus I did a ton of faction work so I could do the Greenmist quest in Cabilis which eventually requires killing Drusella Sathir.<br />
<br />
In general, I would say you have very little faction trouble with a bertoxx human SK. Especially now when you can just go up to PoK from just about anywhere to buy, sell, train skills, etc.  And you will have the advantage of being loved by the SK guild in Qeynos, where you have to do the turn-in for the decrepid sheath. .... of course, if you want to do that stupid Qeynos badge quest, you might be out of luck, but....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Septus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Dif faction problems/not problems off the top of my head:<br />
<br />
You shouldn't really have any probs with being killed in qeynos, I don't recall any npcs there being kos, been a while tho.<br />
<br />
Kos pretty much to all in surefall. Be careful of that bitch Holly Windstalker in qeynos hills, she'll be a thorn in your side for a while prolly.<br />
<br />
I wasn't kos to any of the druids at the druid rings, tho killing in bb might've changed that, if you do get kos to them and want to get unkos, just go slaughter a bunch of gnolls.<br />
<br />
The 2 druids/rangers at the rings in wc are kos.<br />
<br />
In freeport be careful about straying into the buildings by the docks, there's a ogre pally (go figure) who will beat you to a pulp. <br />
<br />
Halflings will hate you, tho it's easily fixed by killing the gobs in misty or runnyeye, i'm ally to them now from farming. =P This will only up the guard faction tho, not the merchants =/ Oh and BEWARE the cleric trainer by the kith zone, she hits for 300 and doesn't like you at all.<br />
<br />
If you go to bb via the fp boat, watch out for the dorfs by the docks they'll hate you initially. First time I went there as a noob, i got aggro from one, and proceeded to run my ass off, then tried to run the gauntlet thru the guards at the kaladim zone. Needless to say I didn't make it. lol<br />
<br />
All in all, it's fairly easy to screw up your Blood Sabers faction, and a huge pain to get it back. I'm scowls with them now from killing Pyzjin in qh and various other naughty things. But I can still buy spells in fp if need be. The guild there is on Opal Darkbriar faction (there are 2 one for the mage guild and the evil guild), which I think is on most if not all Blood Saber hits also but doesn't appear to be as harsh.<br />
<br />
But anywho, human sks are just as viable as any other race. The vision thing IMO is a dumbass arguement, just turn your gamma up =P, besides you get deadeye (infravis) at 22 and shadow sight at 49 (ultravis), so no biggy. And besides our women look the best. =P Good Luck.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Xonthar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Human SK here, a couple things.  Qeynos is a great starting city, had about 30pp by the time i hit lvl 9.  Our Newbie armor is fairly easy to get cept for the breastplate i had troubles with.  We're KoS to the druids, rangers, barbarians in QH, and to farmers and to most of the town's folk in east karana.  Once you hit 12 or so, hit North Karana, its a great place, the guards are dubious, but they'll still save ur life.  You just gotta watch out for Griffs and HGs, Griffawns are big undercons BTW.  After some lvling, you can hit the scene and go off on ur own.  Good Luck to you, and may the Plauge Lord bring misfortune to your enemies.</div></div><hr />
