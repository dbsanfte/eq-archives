<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">There are plenty of threads on ranking the aa's for the existing ones... but what about the new ones?<br />
<br />
I'm thinking that I really like the Intense Hatred aa and that this one is worth the points.  Not sure what I think of the rest.  Advanced Innate Run Speed looks promising, especially for pulling or for pvp.<br />
<br />
I'm wondering if &quot;packrat&quot; is an intensify damage shield aa that's available to all classes, and &quot;intense hatred&quot; is an intensify damage shield aa that's only available to shadowknights... if those stack to allow for double strength damage shields, that could be a HUGE increase in shd power. :)<br />
<br />
DOT crits and pet crits I'm not sure about at the moment... seems like too little dps per aa spent.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts on a ranking of the new aa's?  Which are worth it and which are in the &quot;maybe once I've got 300 aa's I'll consider it&quot; category?<br />
<br />
-Bolas</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Actually, I've heard that packrat is weight reduction.  This would make more sense considering the name.<br />
<br />
Personally, I'm still not convinced about Intense Hatred...it really depends by what factor damage shields are increased for us.  I'll definitely get the innate run speeds.<br />
<br />
Rakk</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Packrat sounds useless then.  Bummer. :(<br />
<br />
I've heard it's +10% ds per level... that sounds really good to me... +20% would be better of course *grin*.<br />
<br />
-Bolas</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Advanced Innate Run Speed = A+ :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yes, Packrat is 10% weight reduction per level, so worthless to us tank types with high str and weight reducing bags.<br />
<br />
The damage shield increaser is more than 10% though (unless it changed in the last week and a half).  Harmshield and Cloak of Akheva is normally 17 points of damage shield, but with the first level of this, I was getting about 20 points of DS<br />
<br />
If you are a pet puller, like myself, the new AA that lets you tuck pet away while you are in zone is nice.  That way when you have a nice pet with buffs and gear you can invis without losing it<br />
<br />
The runspeed AAs will be nice, but it's also 5 points for the first level, and unknown for the 2nd level, and I'm not sure how much difference it makes.  I think that these AAs will be nice, although the price is a bit high.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Runspeed could make a HUGE difference in pvp though... so would be worth the 5 points on a pvp server.<br />
<br />
Forget packrat.<br />
<br />
I'm glad to hear that it's more like 20% per level... that's gonna give me an insane damage shield, muahahahaha.  I'm saving my aa's soon for the new damage shield aa, no doubt about it.<br />
<br />
-Bolas</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">In one of the other threads in the arena, someone mentions that the DS is 30 points fully maxed.  There is no mention of a percentage, nor mention of scaling (benefit per points).<br />
<br />
First level cost is 3, so guessing subsequent cost is 6/9/12/15 = 45 pts for 30 DS.  If it scales 6 DS per aa lvl for 5 levels, then I will likely spend 18 pts to level 3 immediately for 18 DS -- the rest to get later.  Way later.  If it scales, or uses percentages -- I may rethink that.  But on GoD release day, I'll probably buy lvl 1 right away and just check to make sure.<br />
<br />
Providing not much changes from what's already been mentioned, I will prolly get run 1 and innate hatred 3 on the first day and maybe one other thing, not sure what yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wyrdlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The two bash AA's have potential, but I haven't heard what they actually DO so it's hard to tell how nice they may be.<br />
<br />
One is supposed to make shields do more damage, whatever that parses to.  The other is something about stuns.  I haven't seen anything more specific though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I heard that the intense hatred makes the damage shields that others cast upon you do more damage -- in other words, you get an additional percentage for their shields.  I was hoping that you'd get +20%, +40%, +60%, +80%, +100% to your existing damage shields per level.  Or even +10%, +20%, +30%, +40%, +50%.<br />
<br />
But if it's +3 ds, +6 ds, +9 ds +12 ds, +15 ds, that's not near as fun as a +% to your existing.  Still good tho.<br />
<br />
Good shield aa's make sense, that way you can have a legit choice between 1h + shield with corresponding aa's, or 2h with corresponding aa's.<br />
<br />
-Bolas</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Either way for the DS, by percentage or set amount per level would suit me fine; as long as the percentage wasn't too low or damage per level wasn't too low -- i.e. too low that's it's not worth investing any points in at all.  I think 5 pts of DS per level or 10% per level (assuming linear non-scaling levels) would be the least where I'd think &quot;Hey cool, I want that ability&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Lets all hope the game content is better than the AA's or we'll all be looking forward to EQ 2 or the next expansion.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Thack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Actually, if they got rid of suspend minion, I'm going to be pissed.  That's the first one I was wanting to get today.  I had AAs all saved up for it an everything.  I'm an avid pet puller and that AA was going to help a lot with not having to cast as many pets and buff them and such.<br />
<br />
But yeah, I'm not very impressed with the rest of them.  oh well, I guess I'll just skip getting most of them until I have 250 or so AAs</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well i have 250, and as it is many of the super weak pre GoD aa's look better than the GoD ones. Increased resists here I come...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Thack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">ROTFL<br />

Yeah, I think I'd kinda agree there.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Knight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">As sad as this may seem...the AA I was most looking forward to was Suspend Minion~</div></div><hr />

Suspended Minion sounds like a helluva fun AA .. keeping out 2 pets ( 1 suspended of course ) would be kinda nifty .. but I just cant' see myself spending all that AA on it even if it stayed live ( which it didnt ).<br />
<br />
Although after some more research I am however taking a little more shine to the new bash aa's.  I might have to re-examine my grading on at least 1 of these.<br />
<br />
<br />
*** LONG PAUSE ***<br />
<br />
Ok I have re-evaluated and have determined I am going to give:<br />
<br />
Visious Smash = B -<br />
Immobilizing Bash = B -<br />
Weapon Affinity = B -<br />
<br />
but I have to change my grade for:<br />
<br />
Pet Affinity = F<br />
<br />
for costing 20 FREAKING AA's ?!?!?!?!:eek: <br />

<br />
<br />
Uhh? B- for something that fucks up your self-buffs further? right.<br />
<br />
Vicious Smash B-? Immobilizing Bash? You have to be kidding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Thack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Actually the pet affinity would be nice, but 20 AAs is a bit stupid.  The main thing that I would like about it is that as an avid pet puller, I always have my cleric virtue my pet when I'm pulling.  It would save me a dot if pet could get virtue when cleric does group virtue.  Some day I may get it, but for that cost it's going to be quite a while.<br />
<br />
I still miss the suspend minion though.  I had my AAs all saved up for that one.  *sniff*.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">they good for pvp like i suspect camby? i only got the first lvl of stun one so far so dont know heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Kruggan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Simply put, I'm pretty disgruntled with our SK specific (not the ones other classes get) AA's from GoD.  I doubt I'll spend any AA in any of them for a long time.  20 AA so that my pet (which I rarely use) can be group or raid buffed?  20 AA?  I'd like some of that weed the developers are smoking.  15 AA or more so that my pet can have a *chance* to perform crits?  Again, I rarely use the pet.  It might have some useful applicant when pet-kiting or in a LDoN group maybe.  And then there's Intense Hatred...which of course most of us initially thought was an agro related skill.  No thanks.  Yes, a dmg shield enhancement is nice, but not that nice.  <br />
<br />
I'm pretty happy about the Tribute system, but there are times when I actually wonder if anyone on the development team has the slightest idea what's involved in playing a high lvl SK.  I would have payed 50 AA for an ability that would have allowed FD to be hotkeyd or for an AA ability that gives us a once-per-day no-exp resurrection (as far fetched as it is).  But this other SK specific crap is a slap in the face.<br />
<br />
Just my 2cp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Yoggi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Fellow VZ SK... Splorge spend his banked 30aa<br />
<br />
Run 5 (5+10aa) is ok... even if its expensive... but for pvp a must<br />
<br />
Immo bash 1:<br />
No idea,  have to see result  or &quot;stun&quot; msg <br />
<br />
Intense Hatre 1:<br />
 (3aa-45aa) =3DS-15DS (if any DS up)  not really usefull vs mobs hitting for 1200-1400 in GoD ... for pvp well also hardly noticable - but still better then innate wisdom..<br />
<br />
No on any Pet related GoD stuff<br />
worst crap.... even if I do regularly use my pet ...<br />
<br />
Weapon Affinity 2<br />
I dont parse but hopefully it works, but guess its faster and more effective DPS vise just to stick a LDoN type8 Proc augement (150dmg/Guard iv/Mirror III/Tap75) proc on my Dreamers Despair.<br />
<br />
<br />
 Persisant Casting 1<br />
Should be PvE wise very usefull, but also hard to jugde...<br />
...<br />
<br />
I got my first 6 GL AA points (20%less regular/AA xp) today<br />
and for 4GL AA of them I got HP enchancement I = + 30hp for all groupmembers -&gt; if they trust my lead...!!!<br />
<br />
I guess I will go for the other more funky GL AA like Mark Target/Offensive and Spell awarness next as they might have a bigger impact PVE/PVP related then 30HP (well 3-6 times 30hp= 180HP)<br />
<br />
I agree with the above poster ... I easily would spend all my 30 aa for  FD to be hotkeyd or for an AA ability that gives my a once-per-day no-exp resurrection (as far fetched as it is) or something in the lines of a Necro Ress, (which I always carry a few around incase my fellow nerco is out of them)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>aress</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I bought all of weapon affinity.  Lot's of AA, but what other option is there?<br />
<br />
Now what is next?  I wish they had given us a new pet, then I would go for the pet stuff next.  Otherwise, not worth a cent.<br />
<br />
DS?  come on, not worth the number of AA.<br />
<br />
Persistant casting?  I do not need to cast while stunned.  It happens very rarely anyways.  Our problem is that melee hits interupt our spells.  The ability does nothing for that.<br />
<br />
shield stuff? whatever...<br />
<br />
Consumption of soul?  It remains the joke it is.  Unless SOE puts it on a different timer than HT or LC, we will never use it.<br />
<br />
So, I guess I will get runspeed next, then continue spending points on PoP AAs to max out my resistance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Daikoku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Weapon Affinity = B<br />
Bad for MC,  2hdr is a sews, so main proc is good no matter what,  Elemental 1hander for now,  soon time,  lifetap proc there too, so that is not horrid<br />
<br />
Persistant Casting = B<br />
Pet Affinity = F<br />
Improved innate cha  wtfpwns this<br />
Critical Affliction = C<br />
A little too little, but anything that makes aggro kitting more doable will have some pay off<br />
Death's Fury = F<br />
Immobilizing Bash = B<br />
Viscious Smash = D<br />
I am tending to agree that with what I have seen from GoD that when we are going to be tankinganything high end we are going to be wanting all the AC/HP we can get, the over all bonus of Smash seems minimal, I've not seen any <br />
<br />
Improved Consumption of the Soul = F<br />
Intense Hatred = D<br />
Improved Innate Run Speed = A<br />
Less wastedtime running around<br />
Improved Innate Regen = D<br />
I do not get that low on HP farming<br />
Improved Lung Capacity = F<br />
Packrat = D<br />
would be nice for farming really would want toee  what it does in nuber form before going beyond 1 level.<br />
<br />
Pretty much what I did was get both levels of run and then spent 11 aa in level 1's of stuff<br />
<br />
Unless a lot of stuff looks alot better then it does now, thatis all I will spend, Brings back memories of mental clarity, level one was ok, had to have like 150+ AA to make the other 2 levels of it worth buying.<br />
<br />
Dai</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Camby_VZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Well, That's what im hoping for Dhantes .. I cannot say for sure how they will work in PvP but I am assuming they will help some in the ' caster interrupt ' department .. be nice to interrupt them damn chanters and that chain rune casting ... which we all know is very annoying.<br />
<br />
Im also interested a bit more in the weapon affinity .. hense my weapon has a 100 pt heal proc so more proc = more heals for me but we'll have to wait and see how they go.<br />
<br />
Uhh? B- for something that fucks up your self-buffs further? right. <br />
<br />
I dont see anywhere in the description of those 3 Abilities the words &quot; Will mess up your self buffs &quot; Enlighten us further Frotty ( if that is your real name ) so we can share in this secret knowledge you are keeping from us all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">there is a parse i think in the main section arena or whatever its called (late dont remeber) that shows WA5 with a procing weapon+aug+ buff will lower the amount your buff proc goes off but you should get more dps and if you say have 100 lifetap 75 lifetap proc more heals though from what i understand then not having WA5, if i ever get a GSH my first step will be to get a vampire kiss aug in it then get WA5 though thats for sure (guild has a long way to go to getting me that GSH though hehe :) sucessful raid last night were only my 65 cleric and a 56 cleric were in the ch chain hehe)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Lynxal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Does immobilizing bash only increase your chance of stunning/interrupting mobs that were previously stunnable/interruptable?<br />
<br />
Or does it further increase the level at which you are allowed to stun/interrupt as well?<br />
<br />
And/Or have I always been able to interrupt a level 60-65 caster but the chance was so freaking low that it seemed like it was impossible and now with this AA you can noticably interrupt?<br />
<br />
Are the gates mobs all lower level than PoP and LDoN so that you can actually interrupt mobs again?  IF it does not increase the level I can effect with the bash, or all gates mobs are low level, I am not sure what use it is...the last time I actually interrupted with efficiency was Cazic.</div></div><hr />
