<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Raksis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am trying to decide between races for a pvp server -iksar and troll i enjoy playing both races. 2hnders are pretty nice and am wondering if i should go fat for the slam? Ive gotten used to regen but may even go ogre.<br />
  Main question is how effective slam is for pvp encounters(not dueling) when you are using a 2hnder compared to what you know or think its like using a 2hnder without slam. <br />
  I have a few untwinked sk's on a pvp server ,all under 10, and have died and survived some encounters but wouldnt mind some advice from more experienced peaple.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Polite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Slam is extremely effective against pure casters if you time your slams correctly. At higher levels most casters can channel through your regular hits rather easy making slams/bash more useful.<br />
<br />
 You will be happy you can slam every time you prevent a caster from gating to safety or blasting you for 700 points of damage.<br />
<br />
If you are planning to go high lvl there is always the option of 2h bashing AA points though it is a lvl 59 ability and rather costly :)</div></div><hr />
