<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Inevub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I haven't done too many LDoN's and was wondering if fear is safe to use there for aggro?  Some of the mobs are pretty wimpy and wasnt sure on the levels.  Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">From personal experience, if your group's average level is 64 or greater, fear is safe.  This may dip down even further, but I know for a fact that three 65's, a 64 and two 63's in a group was enough to bump the mob level on a normal adventure in to the range at which fear was safe on all mobs.<br />
<br />
It seems like I had a group with average level 63 or so that was fear safe as well, but I didn't check the actual average level, so I'm not sure on that one.<br />
<br />
I've never tried this, but do mobs run if you fear them while they're mez'd?  If not, there's an easy way to find out what the precise minimum average level is.  I'll do some testing at some point when I finish my last three Tak adventures and the points aren't so important to me anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mdiyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I usually fear mobs on INC and grab aggro quickly, they don't run when mezzed and as has been stated here several times it is often the best way to get aggro before breaking mez.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Originally posted by Mdiyan <br />
they don't run when mezzed  <br />
<br />
Even when below the fear cap?<br />
<br />
I don't doubt or dispute fear's effectiveness at breaking mez.  I'm just saying that if we know one way or another whether mobs below fear cap will run when mez'd (and this is probably known and discussed ad nauseum, I've just never seen it and never cared enough to look), then it's easy to determine what the average group level in an adventure would have to be to ensure viability of fear for aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Inevub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">thx guys, /wave mdiyan</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Halfwarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">as a lv 65 sk i always use fear as my agro..... never have yet to seen a mob run being to low and i had some pretty low LDON groups ..... just don't try to pull a lesser elemental mob in BOT with fear .... whoops</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>cames</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">At 65 the lowest level person you can group with is 58, so you are likely to have a level 60 adventure at minimum.  In those adventures, I have not seen any running on fear.<br />
<br />
In level 55 and below adventures, there will be an issue as the mobs are blue to a 55.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kazral Shadowthirst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Fear sticks on mobs in LDoN under level 55. If you are 55 and the mob is white or greater con, then you are safe. Use it in an upper 50s group for agro and use it sparingly if there is a chance that a blue mob is under 55.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Culdahl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I've always used engulfing to grab aggro from puller, and used my highest 1 second cast terror spell to keep aggro.  When breaking mezz I just taunt, cast terror, taunt again, and engulf....works for me everytime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>scaledge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If you arent sure on the mob's lv, use CD, not fear.<br />
<br />
Better to not have as complete of an aggro lock than bring a train on top of your group's heads and TPW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Wienaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">WARNING: If you break open a trap in an LDoN, even a level 65 one, the trap mobs ARE below level 55...I found out the hard way when my grp had to evac after I feared two away before realizing what I was doing, haha</div></div><hr />
