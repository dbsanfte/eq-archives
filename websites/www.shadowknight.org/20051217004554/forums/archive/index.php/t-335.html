<br />
Stats:<br />
<br />
SoG 41/52 STR +25 STA +10 WT 1.5<br />
<br />
AP 42/49 STR +10 WIZ +10 INT +10 HP +25 MANA +25 WT 10.<br />
<br />
The AP has slightly better ratio, but at the cost of 15 STR, which much effect damage output some.  Any thoughts on which is better?</div></div><hr />

<br />
It doesnt affect you at all, in raids your STR should be just fine :)<br />
<br />
Go for AP.<br />
<br />
Oh and if you are really worried about STR, and do not have this spell already, go look for the super nice strength tap that Luclin gave us, &quot;Abduction of strength&quot;. It can be bought in Echo caverns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brael</div><div class="date">04-02-2002, 02:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its my feeling that the damage/dealy on the weapon are more important than any other various stats, what you lose from that is minor compared to how the weapon helps you... I would suggest using the AP (and yes at one time at level 60 I had 113 str, so im speaking from expierence when I say go by the damage/delay on the weapon, or by the hp/ac/resists on the armor)</div></div><hr />

I use grodan because of the Stamina bonus as well as the str. I dont really run out of mana often, so the wint and mana dont matter to me much.<br />
<br />
For raids though, I would pull out an Axe of Lost Souls because of the saves.</div></div><hr />

Does anyone know if the SoG does more damage overall then the SoP combo and if so does anyone think its worth giving up the AC for??<br />

Remember:<br />
<br />
SoP 10ac = 15ac<br />
SBS 25ac = 37ac<br />
<br />
total ac    = 52 with this combo equipped.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fluxurak</div><div class="date">04-02-2002, 11:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That is way too funny... I had the exact same thing happen to me about a month ago in our last chardok raid.  I was using SoG, and since no monks were on, I pulled whole raid.  Our GL gave me the AP that dropped and I was like, gah, what too use... I have been using the AP though and love it.  Big str loss, but in grps usually get buffs, if not, over 200 anyway, and can always tap 25. <br />
<br />
Got a SoP few weeks ago too.. being an Ogre, went almost 50+ levels not using 1H ('cept for moss).  SoP ratio not quite as good as AP, but I use it as recommened by some many other SK'z on here, when MA too keep agro.  Fast lil SoaB.  Prob is, I have a sucky arse shield since I never used 1H much b4.  &quot;Runed&quot; Something or Other.  From a named giant in GD (dr00d buddy of mine was hunting there one day a long time ago and said, come loot this thing, lol)  Nice for the resists on raids.. 15ac +10 vs M/C/F if I remember.<br />
<br />
Oh, well, way off track.  USE the AP!  I luv mine (damn u drake hide and soul leech!!! only thing keeping me from epic)</div></div><hr />

Without hesitation, the AP is clearly a superior weapon. And yes, I've used both ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Argent Protector all the way.<br />
<br />
You'll hit a little faster, just as hard (the 15 str loss is not as big of a deal as you might think, especially since you should always have a trusty shaman at your side), but, most importantly, you will get 10 more AC!!.  And we all know that AC is king for a shadow knight.<br />
<br />
This is particularly valuable since we lose a shield when wielding 2-handed weapons, and it gives us some compensation when we have to trade out a high-ac piece of armor for a haste item.</div></div><hr />

How often is an sk really the Main tank in need of AC?<br />
<br />
3/10's of a second really isnt s speed difference, but it does put grodan into a higher dmg bonus bracket.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Malikith</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 05:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I MT a lot.  I have MTed most mobs that do not require defensive (HoT mobs, Dlammaz Stormslayer, Lord Dojo even Kunark dragons as I can hold aggro.)  I have both the AP and the SoG and I only use the AP.  I do not see it being replaced in the near future, until I get my epic.  I miss the Sta of the SoG but not enough to give up the damage of the AP.  I have 204 unbuffed Str so that is not an issue for me. <br />
<br />
I actually parsed SoG, SoP and AP a while back and the AP consistantly had the highest damage.  I will try and scrounge up the logs (or make new ones) but if I recall I was doing around 38dps with AP + CoCW + Eyepatch of Plunder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SpurniaVZ</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 06:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I havent used the AP soo I cant quite speak of the weapon or how much better it is, but I did find that seeing as the SoG was soo low in WT , I found that highly usefull seeing as when I was using my Aged Velium Claidhmoore it was like around WT 5.4 or soo and I had some stamina issues. What are the views on the WT factor seeing as it does weigh  10.0 as opposed to the SoG? Just curious for those lucky individuals who had the opportunity to chose between the two.<br />

I have no clue in hell what they go for but all i can think is WHAT A GREAT SOLO WEAPON. If you get the chance i suggest you buy buy buy if you have the money of course it is amazing how much damage you can do i mean i using a tantors tusk and even im surprized how 9 lvls and 1 damage can do so much more... anyway im done<br />
<br />
Back to the question Hands down AP the ac is great and the int is awsome for soloing + you got the delay thing again allowing maximum damage output so no more whining about how slow it is. SoG is a good weapon and slower i will admit but not by much and the str and sta as said before can be remidied with a local shaman or a few taps (dunno bout the sta tho just try your best to keep it above 100 and your fine the stats you loose if your out of sta hurt)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drakang</div><div class="date">04-23-2002, 09:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Would also be interested in how those with AP do on stamina.<br />
With my Stamina at 102 unbuffed using SoG I have never even seen my stamina bar move off full.  I also find that with Speed of the Shissar(No I still don't have any haste items) it drops the delay on the SoG to just the point where I can slip in a quick lifetap (the 75point one) between every other attack without slowing my attack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neq</div><div class="date">04-23-2002, 10:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a note ... as long as your stamina is over 100 the only thing the yellow bar running empty does to you is not let you jump, you don't get the slowdown and stat penalties. So as long as your stam is 100+ it really doesn't matter that much how heavy the weapons are I wouldn't think</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CanizMortem</div><div class="date">04-23-2002, 10:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as the weight is concerned, if your stamina is 100 or above, an empty stamina bar is irrelevant.  I use Iceflame (35/44) and its weight is 15.0.  I never miss a swing because I make sure my STA is always over 100.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimmtooth</div><div class="date">04-23-2002, 11:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">a Decrease of 2 Delay on a 51 Delay weapon is alomost a 4% change, Okami.<br />
<br />
That's almost 4% more damage in and of itself, even if you assume that the SoG is going to have the same damage as the AP after you add in the extra +1 damage bonus for the &gt;50 delay on the SoG.<br />
<br />
I dunno about you, but I consider 4% pretty significant when we are talkign about damage output.<br />
<br />
The weight (10 on the AP) shouldn't be an issue for most people.  If your STA is over 100 you won't see any ill effects of running your yellow STA bar down to nothing - except that you wont be able to jump.<br />
<br />
I have a question for the higher level SKs that have been MAing on big game hunts:  do you feel that you HAVE to resort to a 1 Handed weapon to keep agro?<br />
<br />
I've been using a Reaver (40/40) almost all the time since I got it, and a Weighted Velium Battle Axe (32/38) when I run across things I cannot hit with the Reaver.  I'm an Ogre, and I, too, have neglected my 1HS ability somewhat - I just don't have any 1 handers that can compare to the damage I can do with my 2 handers.<br />

<br />
The AP or an Etched Velium War Lance (30/35).<br />
<br />
Both the AP and the Etched Velium War Lance have exactly the same ratio from what I can tell 30/35 = 42/49. Also with the faster weapon, the damage bonus would apply more often thus causing more damage over time? It seems the Warriors believe this is the case.<br />
<br />
What are your thoughts</div></div><hr />

We are the supreme masters of aggro when we want to be.  The only thing that I think rivals us is when a necromancer goes all out  LOL.  :)<br />
<br />
When I can score an even better weapon than my AP, WATCH OUT!<br />
<br />
And yes, AP &gt; SoG</div></div><hr />

I allready have he Edge of honor, 20/24 and some other stats form Umbral plains. I must say that it seems I still kill the mob faster with the E.O.H. I had the dizok Imperial cantana before I got the E.O.H and found out early on that the E.O.H out damaged the D.I.C time wise. I would always normally kill the mob a little quicker. Sure you get the big hits with the two hand slashers but it sure seems to me that I cant to better then the E.O.H. for now. Can anyone add to this? I would love some opinions.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hunga</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 03:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Between AP and SoG, AP is a far superior weapon in my opinion.  As everyone else has mentioned, 4% increase in damage output is not trivial.<br />
<br />
Regarding the question of AP (42/49) vs Etched Velium Lance (30/35), this gets pretty interesting.  They both have identical dmg/delay ratio, so which ever has a relatively higher damage bonus at your level would be a better choice for pure melee damage.  By relative damage bonus, I mean the one that gives a higher bonus/delay.  For example, say at your level, the AP gives 10 dmg bonus and the Lance gives 8.  In this case, the Lance (with a relative bonus damage of 8/35 = .229) will give you higher damage than the AP (10/49 = .204).  Of course, the damage output difference between two identical ratio weapons should be minimal unless one has an insanely high delay (like Weighted Axe).  <br />
<br />
With 2 weapons of identical dmg/delay, there are a couple other things to consider, however.  <br />
1) The faster one will perform more consistently over every fight.  For example, missing 10 times in a row with a 150 delay weapon is not going to hurt as much as missing 10 times in a row with a 50 delay weapon.  (winner - Lance)<br />
2) Reposte would do much more damage with a slower weapon.(winner - AP)<br />
3) Casting in between swings would be more difficult and most likely lower your damage output more with a fast weapon. (winner - probably AP)<br />
<br />
Of course there's stats to consider when all else is equal.  I personally would prefer the lance over AP at level 52 because of #1 and because none of my offensive spells take over 3.5 seconds to cast.</div></div><hr />
