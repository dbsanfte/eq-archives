Two of the trials in particular have been giving our groups some great frustration lately.<br />
<br />
1. Trial of Power. Easy enough trial - kill ~21 mobs in 15 minutes and the MoD is targetable. Kill him, win. The problem has been in the spawn rate. We'll knock off the first 4 mobs then end up waiting 1-2 minutes for the next wave. By the time the 1 minute to 30 second warning has fired, we've only killed 17-18 mobs bc that's all that have spawned! Sometimes, at the 30 second warning, we finally get 2-3 more mobs, but all at once, therefore failing the trial. When we have not had this 'spawn lag' we have won easily, with plenty of mana, ready for the MoD ( who hits decently but is rather easy tbh ).<br />
<br />
2. Trial of Fear. Same problems as above, but additionally, we get waaaay too many fearless mobs. On one run, from the start, we had 9 fearless in a row, with 13+ fearless total, and only 3-5 fearable mobs. Again, not many mobs spawned, but the number of fearless really wore down our kill rate. On times where we have won, spawn rate was not a problem and we'd get between 1-2 fearable mobs a wave, sometimes 3.<br />
<br />
Has anyone else had problems with 'spawn lag' or just an extremely high number of fearless mobs in these trials? It sucks to line up a good group, fight down to a trial, get all prepared and then to get screwed over by something you can do nothing about ( mob type spawns or no mobs spawning at all ), then to be locked out for 1:45 before we can attempt the /random the trial again. =/</div></div><hr />

I have not ever experienced any downtime more than 15 seconds or so, and I've beaten this one 6 times, once as recently as last week. The groups I'm in usually kill one or two mobs more than is necessary before the boss spawns. Always seemed like it's one of the easier ones to me. Were you just sitting on the east wall and waiting for the spawns to come to you?<br />
<br />
Trial of Fear - I don't know what to tell ya. That's just bad luck. I've done this one where we'll get all fearless on the first wave, and other times where they'll all be the normal variety. I'm sure it's working as intended, it just doesn't work in your favor everytime, which sucks for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xanathol</div><div class="date">02-08-2005, 04:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We normally setup on the back wall ( looking at MoD's back ) and when 'camp is clear', we run around, hoping to find one that 'roamed' away or something - still have experienced the down time. =/ I'll try that though, and have folks running around more regularlly.<br />
<br />
Fear, I think they just need to tally the number of fearless versus fearable mobs that spawn. Atm, it seems that the spawns are not kept track of and its just a crapshoot as to how many of which type you'll get. Ie. poor design.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've never done a destruction trial where we didn't have enough mobs spawn during the 15 minutes, but the long pauses between waves certainly made it closer than it needed to be.  Fear is really hit or miss - I've had long streaks of both fearless and fearable.  You've got to have solid DPS to handle the fearless streaks, and Dread Gaze kicks all sorts of ass for that situation as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Araden</div><div class="date">02-10-2005, 05:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">in trial of destruction, you gotta be on the ball n agro spawned mobs when they pop. if they don't get agrod they go to the ramp and poof.  which means yer group is sittin around waiting on more.   Hence the suggestion of having one person runnin around to catch spawning mobs.</div></div><hr />
