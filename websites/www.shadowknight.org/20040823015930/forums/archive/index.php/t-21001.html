Im willing to see what this throwing skill addition is before i complain about it,  yeah at face it sounds like yet another BAD idea lol... but until we get a peak and can evaluate it,  its all just speculation... <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
I do want to say a big THANK YOU to Brenlo....for taking the time to look into this and address it, i have no idea what your day is like, id wager you've got quite alot going on any given day......... Sincerely , Thank you<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Now rogues are a wonderful class, I love being a rogue!!! but there is defintely need/room for improvements....... that said....99% of us feel we've gotten a little rough around the edges, we lack Utility , and our dps seems to be stalled , the line between us and other classes in regards to DPS is very obscure now... <br />
<br />
1) we still need some additional discs/abilities to upgrade our dps  :  A rogue is Primarily a DPS class, that is our role...and perhaps our greatest asset..... to keep our role as masters of melee dps,  we need additional endurance based special attacks, far to often i find myself with plenty of endurance , yet no disc/ability available to use =/ give us more opportunities to use special attacks as well as additional special attacks =)<br />
<br />
a)..some tuning up of triple backstab AA, for the points it cost us to max it out it happens FAR to infrequently, it needs to be tuned up a few notches , make it worthwhile this is one long anticipated often dreamed about ability that has been extremly disappointing overall =/  bottom line.. it needs some work =)<br />
<br />
2) the class is VERY one dimensional, and lacks Utility : We lack Utility! probably the most one dimensional class in the game, give us some other abilities that are seen as beneficial in a group or Raid setting, the possibilites are endless, class balance should have more to do with Utility then with DPS , i think thats a mistake that has been repeated for far to long....<br />
<br />
a) Rogue Mezz?.. Introduce a skill that will alow us the Utility of crowd control. an attack from behind while hidden to stun a mob for say, 30 seconds, or whatever amount of time is deemed appropriate, OR base it on poison , say a poisoned throwing weapon to render a mob incapacitated until awoken...( IE ..mezzed) now we arent talking foregoing a chanter or bard for CC to get a rogue, im talking a utility mezz, much like a necros ghetto mezz....&lt;3<br />
<br />
b) Rogue snare?..An ability to snare reliably... A Tendon Slice seems appropriate.. an attack from behind that severs the mobs tendon, rendering it &quot;snared&quot; pretty simple..... again, not taking the role of another class, obviously a casting class that can snare will be the prefered method...but allowing us this would again , add utility!<br />
<br />
c) Rogue puller? why not!? Bards were made into pullers with the advent of FM combined with their lull songs and ability to gate mobs..... sure even with escape changed we wouldnt be your first choice to pull but it could be done effectivly, IE not taking away a monks role, or even a bard, rogues are sneaky sob's its a natural fit! make Escape an Endurance based skill and additionaly do away with the silly reuse timer... something similarly as effective as a bards fading memories, but endurance based.. <br />
<br />
d) IF openings based melee are ever continued, and honestly i hope they do!... perhaps rogues could be of use in &quot;setting a mob up&quot; or discovering their weakness... for instance a well placed strike or special attack opening up a mobs weakness that can be exploited by the other melee or tank, or pets...*grin* again a decent Utility for us , something to make us more usefull/desireable in a raid/group setting<br />
<br />
e) Melee Debuffer??  how about adding a line of attacks that allows rogues to incapacitate a mobs melee output , or cripple his attacks/defenses, so and so executes a deep cut reducing the targets dexterity and agility, (melee and defense) or split it up, something along these lines, some Utility a group would desire to cause the targets overall dps or mitigation to be lessened by a rogues special attacks...now obviously we wont be taking the role from shamans and enchanters  , but we can do in a pinch..adding much needed depth to our class<br />
<br />
f) Slower? A special attack that debilitates a mobs attack speed for a time.. now we have poisons that slow, they are costly and the ingredients are hard to come by , it just isnt a reliable ability to rank it as a utility, thats another topic all together poison making is in reality a useless skill.... some will surely disagree but for the purposes of having it contribute ot our Utility as compared to other classes it just doesnt measure up at all....imo<br />
<br />
Now obviously im not suggesting we get ALL or even Most of these and additionaly.... these arent MY ideas, they have been around for quite sometime and are the ideas of much more imaginative individuals then I, anyone who is a regular reader of the safehouse website will immediately recognize these ideas...<br />
<br />
What the above ideas when implemented will do is add MUCH needed depth and desireablity of our beloved rogue class, one of the most disheartening things in this great game is feeling useless... and not having any flexability in your role, there are a few core roles, when making a group you start with a ... Healer, then you need a Slower, then a Tank... the rest is gravy...<br />
<br />
Dps is great! but.... 3/4 of the classes can be decent DPS and they are getting closer to us all the time<br />
<br />
Tanks... Warrior Shadkowknight and Paladins.... are really the primary choices, save for the odd uber Beastlord or Monk or Uber character_01, depending on the situation but generaly , its only 3 classes traditionaly cast in the role of MT<br />
<br />
Healers... Clerics, Druids , Shaman all do fine healing, some better then others,  thats pretty much your healers, 3 classes<br />
<br />
Slower....Enchanters, Shaman, Beastlord (Bard?) heh,  these are your primary Slowers... Shaman and Enchanter being your primary slowing classes, beasts do VERY well against many mobs save for high disease resisty guys... and Necros can slow undead , though how reliably im not real certain, but they have the choice, the option, all were asking for is the same...<br />
<br />
Puller... anyone that does hard ldons knows that a good puller is key...sure any class can aggro a mobs and bring it back to the group , however only certain classes can manage pulls exceedingly well.,Monks and Bards, Monks are once again awsome pullers for group settings with their Lull ability , and i for one am glad my Monk brothers finaly got their Due...bards are fantastic pullers also with the ability to Lull, Gate mobs, and Fading memories .... necros and SK's can Feign pull, but it takes forevah! but at least they have the Option and can do in a pinch<br />
<br />
Crowd Control....IE Mezzing, not talking about root parking/offtanking wich works fine in many instances,, Enchanters, Bards are the primary forms of Mezzing CC, additionaly Necros can Ghetto mezz in a pinch, a nice utility making them more usefull to a group<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Porting/Evacing... Druids and Wizards,  NO i dont want the ability to &quot;kidnapp&quot; my group or some kind of ghetto evac &gt;.&lt;... just s listing the different roles =) this is pretty much it when it comes to Evac/Port<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Snaring... Druids/Rangers/SK's, Bards, Necros, Berzerkers! rogues with poison....../laff ... now in all reality many mobs are immune to changes in movement, IE immune to snare/root but it is an important thing in many instances, mobs are running off like Jesse Owens and can cause alot of probs (ldons are good for this...)<br />
<br />
Buffs! lets not forget how important the role of Buffs are, and many many classes get great buffs to offer... rangers (SoT/Predator/CoTRathe, SoW) ,clerics(Kaz/Virtue/ac/vie/spellhaste/DI etc) chanters(haste/manaregen/GV/Runes),beastlords(manaregen/ferocity!/lesser shaman buffs), druids(nine/thorns/seasons/stat buffs etc), shamans(Fo7th/statbuffs/resists/attack/haste and many more), paladins(Brells/Groupheals, ok so not a buff but still!), even SK's! (&lt;3recourse buffs) <br />
<br />
Other caster Utility... Necros (Mana Twitchin, Group Mana/Hitpoint recourse taps, EE rez,DMF! =p) Mages..(Mod-Rods, DMG shields!, Call of Hero, Summoned focus items/pet weapons and armor) Wizards (The Almighty MASS TELEPORT! as well as spell shields..on a side note i think our Wizzy brethren need some help to =/)<br />
<br />
yeah i dont expect a buff ability!... i dont want to take the role of any other classes, but i DO need some options, some Utility, we arent asking for anything that other classes dont already have as an option, the idea here is to make us more desireable to add some depth to the Rogue class, some Utility role<br />
<br />
now some will say, you made a rogue, you knew what they are all about so why are you asking for more now?<br />
<br />
well to be quite honest, times have changed, class roles have changed and and many class's horizons been broadened, but rogues have stayed the same , in many ways we are obsolete, we need upgrading... this has made us unbalanced in regards to the other classes Utility/Desireablilty , DPS is all i really have to offer a group..yet the gap between myself and other classes DPS output has blured the lines to the point that rogues are no longer considered the first or even second choice, mainly because of our one dimensional role and Utter lack of Utility...corpse recovery was our lone utility, occasionaly scouting, but with GoD expansion and the insane amount of See SOS mobs that run at selos speed, that role has been stripped 9this was a mistake btw, I do hope this is toned down a bit, i dont mind a challenge, in fact i love a challenge, but this is just rediculous....combine that with the fact that other classes, melee and pure caster dps has been greatly improved while we have recieved only miniscule upgrades,and we have a serious balance issue.... not complaining about being a rogue i wouldnt trade classes with you for anything, but Rogues want the same opportunities, reasonable Utility roles and a defining Role (DPS) that allows us the same opportunity as others<br />

Brenlo if there is a better forum for this feel free to move it or delete and redirect me to that place ...I couldnt find a feedback forum or one that deals with these type concerns specificaly..</div></div><hr />

MORE desireable??? A rogue can just THINK about logging on and immediately people are sending them group invites.<br />

Reading that makes me want to stab them all with their own pokers.</div></div><hr />

Rogues are great the way they are, and don't need to be changed. They can make some vicious poisions, and are one of the best DPS classes in the game, what more do you friggin want?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>nezzka is bad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">if they get a utility upgrade then we should get a dps upgrade, about 150 dps increase to, because being a tank i can only like tank and use my utility, but when i watn to dps i cannt do lots like a rogue, so i think we should get dual wield, but like dual wield 2handers, like barbarians from d2, but we have spells + war crys :)  i think this is totally fair guys. but at the same time we dont have any low lvl run speed increase spells, we should get a speed tap, that takes there speed and igves it to us and our group, i mean its logical. an sk could do that irl if he wanted to and tehy existd<br />

Being a wizard and reading this post fascinates me actually.  As rogues generally get groups over me.  Rogues are insane DPS and even more useful on raids than wizards are as you are not restricted by mana.  The only thing I can agree on is your triple backstab % needs to be raised as does the increase on Frenzied Devastation for wizards(increase crit chance, spells cost more mana tho to).  Other than that I think you are just trying to mud the classes even more so than they already are.  I wish Wizards would get something useful to a group besides DPS, maybe an upgraded O'keils? we already have the spell line, but their's only like 3 spells, and one is self only.  What SoE could do is make it a single target cast DS, maybe group, nothing on par with mages or druids as that would be way overpowering wizards.  But, at least that would offer us some use as well as increasing our over-all DPS by also increasing our indirect DPS. <br />
Rogues can do pretty much all the things you wanted, lower AC, snare mobs, etc. if you don't believe me get off your ass and go look at EQtrader.com and check out what your poisons actually DO, instead of asking for new abilities utilize the ones you already have, and I guarantee you groups will love you more and more that you crippled mob_01 or that you snared it and it can't run away anymore.  For snares all you really need is probably the first tier ones which if you are 65, than you could just spend 1 training point and farm/baz camp for everything you need.  Just my 2 cp worth on that whole subject</div></div><hr />
