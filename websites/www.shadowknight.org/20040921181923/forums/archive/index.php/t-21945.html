<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Not an important question, just wondering what others thought.<br />
<br />
I was thinking about starting to stockpile adventure points from LDON (have about 1100 atm) in preparation of expansion, assuming that there may be better LDON &quot;stuff&quot; with the next expansion.<br />
<br />
What do you guys think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Noctix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My gut feeling is that they won't be adding any new LDoN content or upgrades.  I hope I'm wrong though because I like LDoN.<br />

I haven't heard any rumors about this coming out of SOE though, which probably means nothing is coming.</div></div><hr />

Has any information been leaked about a higher tier of LDoN gear (i.e. better than the current 1492 gear)?  Or are you just refering to the &quot;all themes&quot; rage armor that they accidently released a few weeks ago and then retracted?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Onoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">it was leaked that there will be armor that is better than 1492 AP armor that is going to be close to elemental level gear.  Course it will cost more as well</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Khat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I heard a rumour that the costs will be 1800.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Onoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I dont think it will be just the same as ep level gear but close.  Also, even if it was the same as EP level gear, the costs and time spent collecting points would make it so that it would not be easier or better or faster to do LDON instead of raid the EP's.  If that was the case, then all the raiding guilds would lose their members( at least the ones that only cared about loot or that used the amount of loot they got to measure their success in EQ which wouldnt be a bad thing imo) cause they would do Ldon instead or raid.   Another thing to take note of is that raiders use raids to gear up and progress though content while causals use Ldon / gates expeditions / quests to gear up and progress though.  Any upgrade to Ldon gear is most likey due to the causal player complaints that gates was useless to them and in response, SoE just upgraded Ldon gear.  I am sure u remember the whole debate over causal vs raiders thread right here on this MB or the large boycott thread( over 30 pages ) on GU Comics and other EQ fansites.</div></div><hr />

I'm sure OoW will be offering raiders gear that is FAR better than Elemental or LDoN armor.  Once OoW comes out, PoP will be 3 (4 if you count LoY) expansions old.  There's no reason that non-raiding players should have their progression halted just because there are some raiding guilds who are still stuck on 2 year old content.<br />
<br />
Besides, people said the same thing about VT when LDoN first came out.  Yet there are hardly any players running around with a fully auged set of Tak armor and there are plenty of guilds still raiding VT.  If anything, people stopped raiding VT because they moved on to the Elmentals or GoD.  I expect it will be new raid content that kills the Elementals, not new LDoN armor.</div></div><hr />

Its nothing to take down 8 nameds in one 4 hour night of raiding EPs, each dropping 2 items per, not to mention 'mini-named' that pop / get in your way while after a target. So in 5 days, its easy for a raiding guild to collect 80 drops of EP gear, and most of the time you'll have less than a 72 man raid taking place. Even if so, that's 1 upgrade per person, with leftoevers.<br />
<br />
LDoN...4 hours of hards is 420? pts. 1800 / 420 and you'd have to do 5 nights of LDoNs to get one item. Then you have to aug it. With effects. With HP. With stats. Yeah...PoP will be made obsolete...<br />
<br />
In all honesty, I think this could *help* raiding guilds in a way. A bottleneck for raiders comes when folks are almost complete in gear, but lack certain pieces. Now you are hoping for certain drops. By giving an LDoN option to fill those slots out with almost equal gear, your guild can move on without raids that 'hope' for drops.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Um.....<br />
<br />
You mean when you're higher level you should get more points? You do.  That is, more points than when you're a lower level...<br />
<br />
ALSO, Hard adventures are already pretty easy.  I know you'll say &quot;OMFG, yeah, they're easy if you're in time gear&quot;... but I had friends who geared up in LDoN gear and did hard adventures all day long.  They lost very very few of them.  <br />
<br />
Being a competent player will get you a long way</div></div><hr />

<br />
You generally on an average raiding night take down less than 8 named first of all. You only get that if you happen to snag full pop Fire. 3-4 named is more common (Earth, Air, Water).<br />
<br />
Also, in your ldon example, in 5 nights you'd get one item PER PERSON, or 6 items, not just one item total.<br />
<br />
If to make the gear elemental quality requires piece + 3 augs for 1800 plus a bunch of points, thats ok. If for 1800 points the base piece is elemental quality, that is excessive.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i'm just mentioning it because people are using 105 points per hard adventure in their calculations, at level 68 it might be 80 points per easy, or 150 per hard, regardless with OoW the amount of points earnable/time should increase.</div></div><hr />

basically summarized as I remember:<br />

They have no plans of introducing EP type armor at LDoN adventurer camps.<br />
<br />
Shrug, with that in mind, I recently purchased the tak helm. <br />
<br />
Regardless, few people accumualte AP fast enough for this to be an issue,<br />
as hardly anyone has full sets of LDoN armor, ie always other slots to upgrade.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Belyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Well, weather its planned now or not they should do it.  Ldon was healthy for the game, it brought together people from all aspects of the game.  I havent been in bot in ages, but how often does someone that has never seen the elemental planes get to group with a fully time geared player to do anything...ldon was the only place that happend on a regular basis i think.  I have witnessed people become better at playing eq in an hours time by grouping with people that outclassed them in gear and skills, simply by dropping a few helpful hints about how to play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Xanathol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">True, higher levels should make the adventures faster and may gain more points per. Yes, 6 people get an item in LDoN as such, but there won't be effects on them, even if the stats are EP quality ( judging by how all effects are type 3 or 8 and bought, in LDoN thus far ). Regardless, just to add effects they'll have to spend more time in LDoN than those 5 nights, so basically, at best, it would give one a choice. I still do not see it as a 'threat' to raiding; there should always be options.<br />
<br />
As for not getting 8 nameds a night...can think of the birds, spider, magma, generals, arch, Fenin all in Fire, hydro, mighty, turtle, Corn in water,  blood, rock, gator, trium in earth, cheiftans, warlord, council in PoEb, avators etc in air and don't forget you can still be farming nice loot off Sol Ro, RZ, etc. and this totally excludes loot from 'lesser' nameds in the way. Hell, phase 1 alone in Time is nice. There is plenty to loot in PoP. And on off-nights, there is GoD. I don't see raiding hurting for lack of loot options in comparision to such LDoN additions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Yeah that's wonderful, if your guild is getting every single named spawn in the EPs, or at least a large portion of them.

<br />
The fact that the mobs exist doesn't mean you get all of them. Also, some of the elem rings take a fair amount of time. If you get any zone other than full pop Fire, you will likely get 3-4 named, not 8. And even in full pop Fire, Druav/birds stuff rots after a while, and fennin event is long. I'm not saying raiders are hurting, I'm just saying your estimate of 8 named a night is absurd. I dare you to link me to any guild dkp page currently farming elems that averages 8 named a night over the course of a month or two. You won't, because you can't. 3 or 4 is the real average.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Visvires</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Ldon augs need to have a wider variance, paticularly with the release of GoD a 40hp aug for 1150 points is... lacking?<br />
<br />
But thats besides the point.<br />
<br />
Things like better foci, and a wider range.<br />
<br />
Id pay 1500 for a slot 8 burning affliction 4 item<br />
<br />
say 750 for a 1% Shielding mod<br />
or spell shield<br />
or dot shield<br />
<br />
1120 for a 2% Strikethrough<br />
<br />
ETC<br />
<br />
Something besides vengeance regen and flowing thought. <br />
<br />
I think they did nicely with the VT esque stats of the 1492 ldon armor, paticularly with the ability to customize it with augs. Yet, slot 3 augs have a wider variance and cheaper cost then slot 8 or even 7 augs. I understand why this was implemented, but at this point I think to keep people interested in ldon, things need to be opened up a bit augmentation wise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Xanathol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">You're right, I can't, but that has nothing to do with whether or not its there ( is your loot distibution publicly posted? ). Anyhow, last night, one guild hit 1 in PoE, then 2 in PoW, then 5 in PoE again.  Night before, 4 in Fire, 1 under EPs, 1 in PoW. Before that, 5 in PoEb, 1 in PoW, 2? in PoF. Point is, just bc you say you can't do it doesn't mean it can't be done. And those ring events, while boring, don't really take that long - mobs die extremely fast. It almost feels like one spends more time targetting than attacking. I can see issues on a heavily contested server, but at last, I don't *think* most servers are that heavily contested from post made here in the &quot;how many guilds do you have in Time on your server&quot; threads. Just bc you don't do it is no fault of the availability. Either way, times change - how many folks didn't gear in VT, yet are now raiders in EPs / Time? So if LDoN does somehow surpass EPs, so be it; its not like it isn't done each expansion in the past.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Belyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Even if ya have access to oodles of gear ya still need augs.  Even though i have been raiding god and augs are about to become transferable, im not even close to done with ldon augs.  As it stands right now there are 5 - 40 hp augs 5 - 10 ac augs and 2 - ft augs that sks wearing type 8 armor need.  Add into that the cost of spells from ldon, well thats just alot of ldons and there probably is only a small percentage of people that are way done with ldon for lack of need.  Add on to that some more useful augments at higher prices, its something that most lvl 65's will do during off raid times.  For all we know omens armor drops could come with multiple augment slots beyond the standard type 4,7, and 8.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Skvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">If they do raise the bar of what is available from LDON then I sure hope that they also allow people who have spent countless boring hours in LDON to get enough points to buy the best armor LDON has to offer can turn that armor in for a FULL refund on those points.<br />
<br />
I know I have a fair bit of LDON armor. Its the best armor available for me at the level of game I play atm. Would I have bought the 1492 armor if there was something better at 1800 points ? Not a chance I would have saved up and got the best that LDON has to offer even if it took me longer to get it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Belyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">That same arguement could be used for when someone gets a peice of ep armor, thinking that they should get a full refund for an item they received use from, in many cases allowing them to progress in the game is not justified.  A tank with crappy gear upgradeing to a full set of 1492 armor, would make doing hard ldons a hell of alot easier, not to mention tanking anything in pop for xp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Skvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Disagree. I dont mind having spent the points knowing that at some point I will get better as I progress in the game. But if the option were to get better equipment merely by spending more time doing something (and lets face it that is LDON is ...time) then I would have spent more time to get the better pieces. <br />
<br />
Its like the person in a DKP guild that does not take the first BP that drops becuase he knows in a week or two he would be able to get a better one. <br />
<br />
LDON points for the casual player are the same as DKP are for the raider ...DKP can be spent when and how you want to spend them. Some people will go for lots of small upgrades, others will only buy what is the best they are realistically obtain in the nearish future.<br />
<br />
If a new level of LDON armor is added then there should be a full refund on any armor / augments that people have already bought (even if its a limited time deal on full refunds) Personally though I do not think that either the armor or the augments should be upgraded. Upgrades are available elsewhere in the game off harder content for those players that need the better equipment</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Agarwaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Improving the gear available from ldon benefits everyone.  Most raid players use ldon points to boost their gear.  These players can, and do, achieve ldon points far faster than most non raid players.  <br />
<br />
Boosting ldon gear benefits raiders more so than non raiders for that reason - they can be selective on dkp, usually have ready access to a crew that knows what it is doing, and can knock over ldons in 25 mins.<br />
<br />
It is no coincedence that the leaderboards are dominated by players from raid guilds, especially in success percentages.<br />
<br />
Sure would be nice to see them overhaul the current ldon system though, particularly the rewards for assasinates and rescues, and the ridiculous downtime waiting for an adventure the group is comfortable with.<br />
<br />
With regards the hard ldons for non raid players, thats just a bad call.   Even raid tagged players avoid hard ldons at 65 due to the risk/reward balance.  Sure they are doable - I have done them with my non raid geared SK, but the time taken, deaths, and significantly higher risk of failure just makes them inefficient.  At the end of the day ldon is about collecting points, the rest is floss.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">It's my opinion that they should NOT add higher level gear to the current LDoN adventures.  If they are going to add higher level LDoN gear, they need to make it purchasable with points only from harder dungeons.  It comes back to the whole having gear appropriate for the content thing.  Giving even better gear than is currently available in LDoN for cranking out content that a below-average bazaar-geared player is fine in is just screwing up the concept of having gear appropriate for the content.  <br />
<br />
I have nothing against new harder LDoN-style content with better rewards, but I don't feel it appropriate for better gear than is currently available to come from such mind-numbingly easy content.  Beyond screwing up gear:content, it'd hurt the GoD progression currently available to casuals - you can do challenging GoD content for gear, or you can do remarkably easy LDoN adventures for similar (better if it were elemental level) gear.  That would be a big step backwards.</div></div><hr />

Slein, what if they made the point cost more appropriate to the quality of the base piece?  Correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't the 1492pt pieces Ornate quality, roughly?  If so, then EP quality should probably cost closer to 2500 points or more.  It'll have to be priced to make us non-raiders put forth the same kind of effort that raiders put into getting equipment from the Elemental Planes.  For that matter, it would also be nice to see them put a Time quality set of equipment for an appropriately higher point cost.  But if they're going to do that, they also need to add appropriate focus effect augments and weapons and misc. augments for weapons and armor that will make them roughly equal to give non-raiders an opportunity to have gear of roughly equal quality as raiders would have.<br />
<br />
Also, how many casual players actually can get a group or into a raid that can get pieces from GoD content?</div></div><hr />

<br />
So if a nice BP was 2500 points.<br />
Well, I average 5-6 LDON runs a week. <br />
at 5 runs a week = 250 points a week<br />
2500 / 250 = 10 weeks.<br />

This looks like it takes as long to get this (if not longer) then those that raid to get drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">With the level cap rising, it would seem to me that they would almost have to add another level of gear to LDoN.  It would probably have a required level somewhere in the 68-70 range, and come close to being elemental quality.  The reason I say that they would almost have to add another level of gear is that with level 70 coming around, won't the top level of LDoN adventures go up, and therefore be more difficult?  With more risk, I think there should be more reward.<br />
<br />
Also, to whoever it was that said that people don't do hard LDoN's, I was doing hard LDoN's with a group of people that wasn't VT keyed or Elemental flagged, and succeeding nearly every time.  Why did we do this?  Because we felt that it was a challenge for us, as we would come very close to failing if we made mistakes.  It's not always about what is fastest, or easiest, but what is actually fun.  We snoozed our way through normal LDoN's with no risk, and it was dull.  Hard LDoN's kept me playing Everquest for a lot longer than I otherwise would have.</div></div><hr />

But if they're going to do that, they also need to add appropriate focus effect augments and weapons and misc. augments for weapons and armor that will make them roughly equal to give non-raiders an opportunity to have gear of roughly equal quality as raiders would have.<br />
<br />
Also, how many casual players actually can get a group or into a raid that can get pieces from GoD content?<br />
<br />
The problem with this, as Slein already stated, is that the quality of gear you would be getting (elemental/time) is absurdly overpowered as compared to the ease of the content (normal ldon). It's almost as if someone were to say &quot;If I kill 20,000 goblins in Sol A, I should be entitled to elemental gear, because I've put in just as much time as the raiders.&quot; Maybe you've put in time, but you've put in time doing something trivial. You could just as easily say that if you spend 300 hours doing tradeskill combines to skill up to 250, you should be awarded elemental gear. <br />
<br />
The point is that not all effort and time spending is created equal. If you do easy stuff, you should get lesser gear. The next step is to do harder stuff for better gear, NOT to do more easy stuff for better gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>shadowfox98</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Interesting Certianly...the problem is often that casual players arn't normally, or easily, accepted into Elemental raiding guilds.  Most need you to be flagged for EPs (requiring a few raid encounters) have a bunch of specific AAs.  And increasingly they don't want or need SK's.  LDoN is relatively easy, but time consuming.  I enjoy being able to at least strive to get some DECENT gear.  As to the trade skills at 250 getting EP gear, Hell if you have to get EP drops to make EP lvl SKILL made armor or weapons ( and really it's a pain, less now with new trades, to get a skill to lvl 250).....I appreciate raiding guilds, and people who can spend tons more time in Norrath then myself.  But hell I'd like to be able to enjoy myself and have decent gear too.  Perferably gear that doesn't require me to pay for it in PP.</div></div><hr />

Here's another suggestion that I think fits better with the current augment system.  New LDoN armor costs 2500 points, has required level 70, and has stats slightly below elemental (and no effects) unaugmented.<br />
<br />
Now here's the key: 3 augment slots...types 2, 3, and 9.  Type 9 augments are only available as drops in level 70 hard adventures and in high end OoW raids.  Type 9 would be a mixture of focus effects and nice ac/hp augs (say 20ac and 60hp).  This means that in order for LDoN armor to reach the level of augmented elemental armor, a person would need drops from level 70 hard adventures.</div></div><hr />

<br />
GoD trials can turn into xp zones with limited degree of AP earning system and new GoD LDON-like vendors there and can buy higher level of gear from there for example. But SOE didn't.  I hope that OOW will have that for 60+ or whatever.

I would like to see them do both.  They should add new LDoN themes AND add new level 70 hard adventures to the old themes.  New gear should be theme independent (purchaseable at all themes) so that people don't have to be stuck at the theme where their class armor is found.<br />

Even if you go nuts and slap 3 augs in a royal attendant item your looking at close to 4000 points for a single item that still wont be as good.  4000 points at best is 40 hours of nonstop LDON.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you do EP AND do LDON, you are better off than person ONLY doing EP cuz you can get shitload of 40 hp augs off LDON to support EP and you can move up to Time quality gear and just simply move many 40 hp augs from EP gear to time gear. Yes, LDON is more attractive than before.. GoD and beyond drop more augs.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't the 1492pt pieces Ornate quality, roughly?  If so, then EP quality should probably cost closer to 2500 points or more.  It'll have to be priced to make us non-raiders put forth the same kind of effort that raiders put into getting equipment from the Elemental Planes.

<br />
Making it take longer isn't the point - having gear appropriate for the content being faced is.  Making better gear than is already available from the insanely trivial LDoN content would be absurd.  I'm all for furthering LDoN-style content, but for better LDoN gear, you need to be required to face harder content.  <br />
<br />
With the level cap rising, it would seem to me that they would almost have to add another level of gear to LDoN. It would probably have a required level somewhere in the 68-70 range, and come close to being elemental quality. The reason I say that they would almost have to add another level of gear is that with level 70 coming around, won't the top level of LDoN adventures go up, and therefore be more difficult? With more risk, I think there should be more reward. <br />
<br />
It's not going to get any harder relative to player power, so not really.  Level 70 players are more powerful than level 65's you know.  <br />
<br />
I really don't see them making a new tier of LDoN armor that can somehow only be purchased if you've earned your points in hard adventures. The reason for this is that there is no system in place to support this and I'm sure SOE is going to make any LDoN improvements work on the current system. <br />
<br />
Make new adventures then.  It's not like it'd be that hard to introduce a bit more LDoN-style content, either with OoW or something.  There are plenty of ways they could do it, from differentiating the points earned from normals and hards to (better) introducing a new set of adventures from the same camps or introducing new camps altogether.  Hell, assuming they continue with the trend of instanced group content in OoW from GoD, they could simply tie point rewards to beating trials, or even add some sort of AP's to the sewer trials or something.  There are plenty of ways they could do it.  <br />
<br />
Here's another suggestion that I think fits better with the current augment system. New LDoN armor costs 2500 points, has required level 70, and has stats slightly below elemental (and no effects) unaugmented. <br />

Making it req level 70 doesn't change anything - it's not like people are going to be staying at 65 anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Consider, OoW comes out... PoP not only winds up being one more expansion older, but with the level cap going up EP is hardly going to be exclusive.<br />
<br />
Currently on Tholuxe there are some seven guilds that are EP flagged, and this alliance of three or more (not really sure on how it works :p) just got Rallos to 30% recently. This is already pushing the limits of &quot;exclusive&quot;. Level 70 is gonna break down the floodgates to EP. I'm not gonna say everyone will be EP flagged, but a whole lot more will be than are now. Casuals can almost get EP flagged already, it won't require much effort at all to get there once OoW comes out.<br />
<br />
Having OoW have a LDoN (or like Nocifer says, something not LDoN, but works the same) with gear approaching elemental wouldn't be out of place at all.<br />

1-make all non quest gear befor VT should be tradable. right now most tradable gear is not that great past the 50s. casual players get gear though farming plat mostly,this would open some good posibilitys that can put em to par bit better hehe<br />

They can create quests that are linked to named mobs, rescue missions and assassinate dungeons.  THis does two things:<br />
1)  creates more risk in an LDON, currently players keep requesting adv until they get either a slay low or collect which are pretty much trivial.  <br />
2)  gives a reason for people to do assassinates or rescues.  <br />
<br />
Possble set-up:<br />
1)  Adventure merchants can sell molds for plate armour that costs 1800ish<br />
2)  you need item004 - aka folded sheet of LDoN metal<br />
3)  you need to collect item001, 002, 003 and hand into NPC to get item004<br />
4)  items 001, 002 and 003 drops off random named, 6 of them drop off named boss mob in assassinate missions and rescue missions awards one to each party member on completion.<br />
5)  combine item001 with plate mold to make armour.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">How about the LDON running raiders side? I dont raid competively i raid on a pvp server at the same time i need gear to both mass pvp for content and to do said content. LDON has helped alot made it easier for the dedicated player to gain gear which makes him a better raider till his guild catches up. It also has its negatives in that like for instance when we were doing vindi for faction + for the first few times to clear to statue for his st key, all our vindi + statue bps pretty much went to alts or new members, when back in my day a vindi bp was awesome (still think a few of our hybrids should of picked them up just for resists in pvp).<br />
<br />
Anyways right now my guilds about to enter ST for first time after keying up for about a month. As such i dont honestly have the time to do LDON's all that much anymore also its much easier and usually better exp to just take members who need lvl's or aa's to a PoP zone. I definetlly think ldon shouldn't be such a chore to acquire points. To fully aug out one item takes alot of time, that could be better spent raiding for my guild or helping my guildmembers lvl. The 50% buy back thing is an awesome and balanced idea in my eyes especially if they release a new version of armor (hopefully just below EP or EP lvl) In about a month we will probably be moving out of ST whole guild primaled and moving into ssra. I've been a dedicated raider in guilds that raid daily for a good 1.5 years i think now. If they released a new set of armor by the time we leave ssra i will probably be walking out of ssra with a ton of upgrades from ssra, and maybe 1 or 2 items from LDON.<br />
<br />
Im not gearing up to join another guild im dedicated to my guild, having an option to provide myself the occasional upgrade from single group content is a good thing though. I think fabled of all things were a bigger hit to lower tier raiding then ldon, during that time no one wanted to raid in my lower guild they all wanted mithril bp's and fbss and mithril 2handers etc. Sitting at one of those camps waiting for a green mob to pop and hoping for assinations and headshots was not earning gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
it seems rather unlikely to me that a roughly 7% increase in lvl is going to net a 60% increase in points per dungeon. at 65 you get 51 for an easy, that going up to 60 seems reasonable to me but 80? i can't imagine that.<br />
<br />
if it were 60 then 30 adventures = one top armor piece. that's the exact ratio you have right now for lvl 65 and the 1500 pt gear. that would seem to make sense.</div></div><hr />

actually, thinking about it, at 68 or so the current &quot;hard&quot; adventures might be the default &quot;normal&quot; adventures, and earn 110+ points. regardless, a group of 67s should be able to complete level 65 hard adventures in less time with greater ease and success ratio.</div></div><hr />

I think there needs to be a way for single-group hunters to acquire elemental level gear in order to get through the single-group trials of GoD.  Right now Kodtaz and beyond is basically only for raiders even though it has single group content.<br />
<br />
One solution I'd love to see is some sort of armor vendor for the sewer and mountain trials.  Every time you complete a sewer or mountain trial, you earn a point.  When you get 10 points you can buy one of seven class specific pieces of armor that are roughly the equivalant of elemental.  This ties a set difficulty (sewers) with the reward (elemental armor).

Mudflation is new &amp; better gear making x encounter easier. Mudflation is not upgrading the loot of x encounter while leaving the difficulty the same. That is stupid.<br />
<br />
If they want to properly itemize sewers/mountains/etc or similar hard zones to allow people to progress, sure. But there is simply no logic to giving out gear which is 10x as good as the content giving it out requires. That is not progression. Progression is fighting progressively harder mobs to get better stuff. Not fighting the same easy mobs for longer to get better stuff.<br />
<br />
I would be all for setting up a new series of dungeons, which are significantly harder than normal ldons, and give out better gear for doing them. But to just give out better gear for the same easy crap is silly and damages the integrity of the game.</div></div><hr />

Once an encounter has been figured out, its over with and becomes a practice in boredom, save the few interesting ones thrown about. There is no logic in comparing the gear rewards based on the 'difficulty' of group farming or raid farming; they are both trivial. There is also no logic in time gear being so much more powerful than non-raid gear; the gap is certainly not needed nor justified.<br />
<br />
&quot;[T]he gap certainly [is] needed [and] justified&quot; by the disparity in the &quot;power&quot; of the content being faced. Someone raiding time is facing content that hits alot harder alot faster and that does alot more mean/nasty shit than someone facing LDoN content.  It's not about &quot;skill&quot; or &quot;time&quot; - it's about having gear appropriate for the content your facing.  You don't need time gear to do the current LDoN's - you need time gear to progress in GoD.  <br />
<br />
I don't mind adding more powerful LDoN gear, but if you're going to do it, it must require facing more powerful LDoN content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">I'm not opposed to the idea of maybe adding a new tier of ldon difficulty at level 70... make it a challenge to do in current Ldon gear, and scale up the points significantly, maybe get 150 for a normal and 300 for a hard, and make elemental level gear and augs for them cost 4000+ per piece.  This makes it darn near impossible to get gobs of elemental level gear with the stupidly easy normal and even hard ldons we're doing currently.  Oh, and a 'normal' at level 70 better be significantly harder than the rediculous current 'normals'.<br />
<br />
I don't have a problem with good single group obtainable gear.  However, you aren't doing anything worth earning the good stuff in current ldons.</div></div><hr />

These stats are meaningless: there's NO REASON TO GO PAST 1,492 points. So why would they?<br />
<br />
Once you hit 1,492 in every camp (which a good group of time folks can max out one camp in a weekend doing Hards) the only thing left to do is max out the charm. That entails generally doing normals in a few dozen minutes or going for hards to fill out the augs and maaaaybe cash/tribute loot. <br />
<br />
In other words, there was no reason to &quot;spend the time&quot; focusing so much on one camp.<br />
<br />
I myself maxed out 3 camps in a week when I finally bothered with LDoN, doing mostly normals with friends, but a lot of hards mixed in. OMG you mean to get 3,000 in three camps I would have had to spend TWO WEEKS?!?!?!?!?!?!?!??!?!?!<br />

<br />
Dead horse is beaten enough i think.<br />
<br />
The point remains that people want to get elemental gear without raiding in a guild and getting to the elementals. IE, apparently LDoN and pre elementals doesn't gear you up enough for any content past LDoN or pre-elems. Well, no shit.<br />
<br />
People want to compare the minutes and hours the actual raid it takes to get a rot loot in Elementals to the minutes and hours the shitty +6 aug dropping in an ldon yields, without acknowleding the 100s and 100s of hours it took gearing everyone up to that point so that some gear IS rotting, never mind the countless backflags, reflags, blown encounters, cockblocks, etc.<br />
<br />
So, to further dummify the game let's cater to hydras by lower the # for an LDoN, and then allow the hydra team to get elemental loots just cuz they do some fucking trivial content OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER. I mean, the first time you win an LDoN handily, it's proven to be trivialized. So the reward here is for utter lack of skill prevalent in today's modern &quot;i don't have enough time to play this video game&quot; lifestyle.<br />
<br />
People act like getting flags is so fucking time consuming UNTIL it comes down to rewarding people for getting them, then it's all about how it's so trivial to be there. Yawn. Sorry, but I can't see allowing someone to do the same fucking content X number of times as being a justification for them being handed ele level loot. <br />
<br />
As Slein and others have pointed out, repeatedly doing Coirnav + minis = getting elemental gear, not repeatedly killing 65 orcs in 35 mins.<br />
<br />
Besides, you could tell SOE right now that laying a cleveland steamer on your chest would encourage casuals to keep their subscriptions, and they'd emergency patch in some MPEG, just for you.</div></div><hr />

Yeah but PoP mudflated the bazaar market like crazy for casual players.  There may not have been much of a content progression for casuals in the original PoP but it certainly offered gear upgrades.</div></div><hr />

The quests took time getting each person their pieces initially.  Once they made it so that only one person needed the pieces to flag 6 people I think it was more than fair and could have been left at that without just opening it up to all levels.  I thought the alt entry quests were well done....The PoD one was especially easy and offered an insta click item.<br />

As far as the whole lack of gear thing goes at release.....there WAS no gear in those zones until they let casuals in just for being level 63 (62?).

It's not an issue of time - I couldn't give two shits how many points the stuff costs to be honest.  It's a matter of having gear appropriate for the content you face.  Nothing encountered by people doing LDoN's warrents EP-level gear.  EP gear is designed for people facing content that is very significantly more powerful than LDoN mobs.

<br />
Speaking as a casual, rather than get a new set of EP-level gear, I'd much prefer them to rescale the cost of the armor so that you could reasonably afford a full set.  I did about a month solid of just doing LDON adventures and I think I have enough points to buy about three pieces of Aggressor's at 48pts a piece.  It's only slightly better than LDON smithed armor, which is easily available in the bazaar.  During a time in my career where I should be looking for Thurg. level upgrades and I can't even afford a set that is the level below it.  <br />
<br />
I think Provender has a valid point.  Casuals don't use LDON for armor set upgrades.  They might get one piece upgraded if they devote all their time to it, but beyond that it's not a valid upgrade path.<br />
<br />
And just to emphasis the point:  I'm not asking for EP gear for doing trivial encounters.  I just think it would be nice if you could upgrade gear sets in LDON in the pre-65 point structure.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And neither do most Elemental raids that EP gear is awarded from. The jump in EP gear was way too big, esp for the effort. If you can get 72 ppl that can only do one thing at a time, put them together with their assingments ( most of them just need to /assist ), then you can organize a group to get EP gear. The only things blocking this are getting that many folks together at once and competition for the spawns. Don't believe bazar geared folks can do it? Look at all the channels and sprouted guilds that never touched Ssra or VT that are in the EPs, and some knocking on the doors of Time. So basically, 'appropriateness' is a pathetic argument. Now throw in the fact that content in GoD is centered around being doable with gear equivilent to EP gear ( some stuff below, some stuff much, much more ) and now its not only makes sense, but is necessary.<br />
<br />
This argument of 'trivializing' content is always presented as if raiders 'only' raid. That couldn't be further from the truth. And now you end up trying to balance content between ppl in EP gear, and ppl in LDoN, ppl setting up a raid for old content 'to play the game through' and ppl one grouping it. Appropriateness...whatever. More like 'I got this from doing X, you should have to do X too..and if you can't, it means I am better than you'. /laugh</div></div><hr />

<br />
Im a 'casual' player (2-3 hours 4 nights a week if im lucky) - Im not elemental (altho im only missing two of the flags now). I use LDON for gear upgrading as it is really the only way I can do it. I see it as a VERY valid upgrade path - infact for me, the only upgrade path.<br />
<br />
Therefore I think they should make elemental type gear available thru LDON - the only question is really how much it should cost.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Third, I dare you to show me a LDoN mob that AEs for 1k or 2k or 3k like some Elem and Elem Flag mobs do which would require the high end gear to live.<br />
<br />
Lastly, the basic concept is you don't get really nice things for doing really easy stuff because it trivializes the game. Progression is progressively getting better rewards for doing harder things, not getting better rewards for doing the same easy thing more. It's just like exp. Mobs go green, ie trivial.</div></div><hr />

In most cases, casual SKs are going to be tanking for their LDoN groups.  A tank in a level 70 LDoN normal (current 65 hard) is going to be taking hits in the 900s that come way faster than AE dmg on a raid.  If they release level 70 hards, I imagine mobs will be hitting for 1200+, more for nameds.  A tank in a level 70 hard LDoN will EASILY need to be geared as well as some random dps toon on an elemental raid who only has to worry about AE damage.<br />
<br />
All of that said, I would rather see a full suit of elemental quality plate armor that drops from level 70 LDoN hard nameds.  This solves the problem of someone stockpiling points doing easy adventures.</div></div><hr />

So your point is?<br />
<br />
Backflagging? /shrug...comes with the ease of the reward. The time and effort is no more, and perhaps less ( once an encounter is learned / figured out ) in raiding. Going from 8-9k buffed to 9-10, better AC, focus, effects, etc is quite a jump, esp considering VT was *the* end zone of luclin, while EPs are not, while EPs can be accessed in less than VT gear, yet KT+ in GoD cannot ( and arguably even KT...when Brael quotes almost being 1 rounded in Tipt, its not really 'doable' by less than EP geared toons...its called luck if you did it, or cheese ( see chanter pets ) ).<br />
<br />
AEs for 1k are a joke...you have more healers there, and some of the mobs you range fight anyhow. AEs, like DT use to, just mean you need more ppl. I get the concept perfectly...you get nice things for really easy raids, and don't want others to get it...waaah. /rolleyes Whether raiding or LDoNing, it all comes down to a simple matter of time investment. If you actually find raiding difficult, I suggest you rethink the way you are going about raiding...</div></div><hr />
