<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Skardd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My cousin and I are getting tired of OT and the beach at Gunthak after leveling 2 sets of toons there.  Where else have people hunted at this level?  I don't need the OT hammer since my cousin has a druid.<br />
<br />
We really like seeing new areas and wanted suggestions of other places to see and hunt.  We raised 2 sets of toons (warrior-shaman and mage-cleric) in the PC&gt;DSP&gt;OT&gt;DL&gt;KC&gt;Dulak route.<br />
<br />
When we got to the Planes, we found the warrior did not have good enough armor or weapons to stay alive and keep agro. We really missed sow on the mage-cleric.  Both duos are at 55.<br />
<br />
We wanted to get this sk-druid duo to 55 then we can experiment with the duo combinations and see we like best.  However we want to try leveling a different route and would welcome any new ideas.<br />
<br />
And before the flaming begins, I have done search and read hours worth of postings but I wanted to see what ideas came up for this particular duo since most of the partnerships I see in the postings are either sk-shaman or sk-cleric.  Why does no one talk about sk-druid duo?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">SolA could take you to 40 and it's fun.  Druid will be mostly healer though.  At 40 you could try the specters in feerot near the PoFear ent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Maelyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm looking for ideas and strategies for a SK/Druid duo myself.  I met my wife on EQ and to keep the sentimental value we'd prefer not to restart our two chars that we met on and got married with.  The outdoors stuff is easy with her snares and me fearing and acting like a necro pet while she DoTs.  But we'd like to have some dungeon fun and haven't found any effective way short of the Tank/lousy excuse for a cleric duo.  Throwing her nukes in to make up the extra DPS so that I don't need so much healing is okay, but does anyone else have any ideas?  Anyone know any good duoable dungeons or other SK/Druid duoable mobs?  We're both mid 40s now and have hunted together since teens so we know exactly how each other thinks and play with comps right next to each other for communication.  Will it be possible to keep this two to planar levels?  I don't want to have to resort to my necro main for the dual kiting unless I have to, and have invested seriously in gear to make our pairing doable.  Her WIS is topped out, 255 with mana uppers and we're working on her resists now.  My gear is probably mid 50 equivalent?  Sword of Bloodsworn and Reaver for main weapons.  1900hps with her buffs, ATK and AC both nearing 1000.  Resists all over 70 unbuffed, and she can raise them all higher.  (I know, this is pathetic compared to most of you all, but I think I'm doing okay :) )  So enough rambling...any ideas or suggestions on zones to try?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Oagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">For Skard, SolA.  Great xp modifier in there.  And get the hammer while you can gain the xp.  You won't always be playing with your cousin.  The reason people pick shaman/sk duos is for the Shaman slow, haste, and melee buffs.  On the Shaman boards, SK's are becoming one of the favorite 2-box choices, because our dot/snare creates more aggro than slow.  You can duo easily to 65 with a shaman, because the shaman can slow the PoP mobs for you.  Druids start having a little harder time in PoP duos, because of the lack of slow.  <br />
<br />
For Maelyn, I would say maybe give the wyverns a try in CS.  You could also try Crystal Caverns.  Good xp modifier in there, as well, plus some velium for selling.  When you get to 50, give Velks a try.  You could also try Solb (Nagafen's Lair).  The higher you get, the deeper you'll be able to go.  I'd say Kaesora, but you're probably wanting to keep your VS faction at this point for spell purchases.  Maybe not, since you have your wife, who can port you, and faction means less and less nowdays.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ramgar SK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Druid-SK duo has little renoun because of the lack of slow.  Everything else is perfect, the DS, the heals, and some good buffs.  This will carry you through level 55, but above that will be considerably more difficult.<br />
<br />
Try Echo Caverns, the non-secret side.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lizarde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Sol A- as mentioned already, great exp modifier and very good cash/sellable loot.  As long as you're not concerned with gnome faction you'll be fine (and why be concerned with gnome faction?  pfft).  There are casters among the bunch and they can nuke for 200 or 300+ as I recall, don't get too confident after you easily kill the warrior types. :)<br />
<br />
Crystal Caverns- decent exp, again very good loot, pretty fun zone once you get used to it.  The orcs are pretty weak but if you're not careful you can create one hell of a swarm of them.<br />
<br />
The Great Divide- may as well start working that Velious faction now.  Frost giant scouts should be pretty easy at 35+ and are dark blue right on through 45 or 47.  They can hit harder than most level 30 mobs, but are easily fear-kited.  Berserkers are tougher, and stay away from Elites, they will ruin your day.<br />
<br />
The Dreadlands- mobs have low HP and low DPS and can be fear-kited.  Can hunt here until your low 50s, assuming you want to go completely crazy.<br />
<br />
Firiona Vie- the valley in the Northeast corner of the zone, that leads to the Swamp of No Hope.  Lots of mobs, easily pulled into an area with no wanderers, decent exp.  Lots of shaman mobs, though, and they can be a real pain in the ass.  But as long as there is no one else there you can pull all day long without a break if you want.  Good exp until 39.<br />
<br />
Dawnshroud Peaks- Yeah, everyone goes there, but with LDoN you might find a nice corner or two to pull to.  Might not be worth it if its crowded, the /ooc and /shout arguments are entertaining for a while though.<br />
<br />
And if you want to be old school, the basement in Unrest could take you to 39 or 40 pretty fast as well.  Fun zone, tons of undead, nice atmosphere, and a very good exp modifier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Maelyn - Grimling Forest grimling camps and work your way into the caves that lead to AC.  Nice exp and the loot is used in tradeskills (windstones and acrylia) and tradeskill useable items seem to be selling for a premium now so you can get some of your investment back.</div></div><hr />
