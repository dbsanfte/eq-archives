<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tropics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Keep it reasonable, no 150dmg 10dly weapons with DT proc and crap. In line with the top end GoD and the assumed slightly better weapons we will see at the top of OOW what would you create as the ultimate weapon for our classes epic 2.0, which proc and such? It seems to be a 2 hander by way of the pics so stick to that. This took place years ago on the first epic and some discussion on this board and the older board and proved quite cool and fun. I shall start  :) <br />

Shielding: 6%<br />
Spell Shielding: 6%<br />
3 Aug slots.<br />
<br />
Proc: Cry of the Ancients<br />
Souls contained in the blade scream out in anguish, terror and pain.<br />
200 DMG lifetap combined with a degrading attack tap of 180 for 6 total ticks. Each tick the attack tap degrades by 30 such that after 6 ticks is has dispersed. Procs while the effect is in place refresh the buff/debuff such that with continual procs we can keep the effect up near the top effectiveness.<br />
<br />
The lore behind the blade would be that ancient paladins of good were hunted down and slaughtered by a particularily nasty Shadowknight who was building the ultimate weapon of power for Bertoxolus. He killed hundreds of paladins and captured their essence in the blade. Before he could finish the most powerful of the paladins who remained were aided by a mysterious warrior of good and in a huge battle they were able to kill the Shadowknight, therefore the weapon was never completed. The quest would then involve collecting the scattered pieces of the blade guarded across the world and hidden in various places, getting the magical power to bring the blade back to its former glory, and then finally to hunt down the remaining ancient paladins and kill them thereby captureing their souls into the blade. The final epic battle would be after killing all of the ancient paladins and getting all their essenses and then having one last epic battle with that mystery paladin guy who turns out to be a immortal paladin who has lived through countless ages. By beating him down and defeating him he is able to be captured into the blade thereby not being killed (as he is immortal) but instead being imprisoned into the blade and his powers being turned to evil.<br />
<br />
I like that, it is nice and evil.</div></div><hr />

Probably either sucks or is overpowered in some way - I don't care, I put about the same amount of thought into it that I put into taking a piss at 6am.  You get the point - in the perfect world, I'd have it be 1h with a sizable stunning lifetap proc, a focus that covered more than one need, and had several useful modifiers... kinda like a soothing earstone of striated clay on crack (I.E. one item that fills several needs).</div></div><hr />

and totally agree with SJ on effect and particularly the proc being a lifetap/stun.  the proc needs to be high aggro in any case, a lifetap/stun would be perfect.  and I like procs that actually matter, not gimpy 125-150 point procs like rangers fire off every 2 seconds of melee.</div></div><hr />

The key here is that it is easily one groupable by a high end group.  However, there are also a half dozen class specific augments to add some killer effects (say a +20dmg aug, end game focii augs, unique class defining proc augs, etc).  Some of the augments might alter the graphic on the weapon too.<br />
<br />
I love the idea of a customizable epic that scales up as you progress.  I hate the idea of doing one ginormous quest for a single item that will be outdated next expansion.</div></div><hr />

I also like the idea of a customizable epic.  Another idea is something like Greenmist, you get a gimpy wep, then do some quests and it becomes a good one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd have to say that the Beastlord epic is even easier than the cleric epic. I've done both all the way through, each in 1 week's time, but I think the entire BST epic can be done by 3 casual 65s in crappy gear easily, while the cleric epic takes about 6 people for some encounters. Both are way easy, however.<br />

That would probably give the sk at least some chance of tanking with being killed.<br />
the dly  also needs to be high enough that reposte damage does make it useless. with the damage high enough that the proc would keep us alive against some of the harder hitting mobs.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Skrull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I like your idea, Tropics.<br />
<br />
I also agree with others who've stated that it'd be nice if the epic grew as you did the quest (kinda like Greenmist did).<br />
<br />
Also really like the Lifesteal idea.<br />
<br />
Read something in a previous thread similar to this about an idea that the epic quest could be something like: Get base weapon, then the rest ofthe quest is getting specific augs to put into it, get all the augs for Epic2.0.<br />
<br />
This also fits into Tropics' story, about collecting the parts of the broken weapon, to resume where the previous SK left off.<br />
<br />
To get epic 1.5:<br />
<br />
You do some raid or whatever to get the base weapon.<br />
<br />
Say...<br />
<br />
45dam 30del 2hs 50ac<br />
<br />
5 saves/stats 60hp/mana.<br />
<br />
5pct lifesteal<br />
<br />
Then, you gotta collect the missing peices. Each peice is an aug that only fits into this weapon. They get harder and harder to get further along into the quest you go, maybe. And you have to do them in order. You can of course only get one of each.<br />
<br />
1st aug: 1dmg 5 saves/stats 60hp/mana 1pct lifesteal<br />
2nd aug: 1dmg 1pct shielding 1pct spellshield 1pct lifesteal<br />
3rd aug: 1dmg 5saves/saves 10ac 1pct lifesteal<br />
4th aug: 1dmg 1pct shielding 1pct spellshield 10ac 1pct lifesteal<br />
5th aug: 1dmg 1pct shielding 1pct spellshield 60hp/mana 1pct lifetseal Focus: Something real useful. :P<br />
<br />
At this point you'd have:<br />
<br />
50dam 30del 2hs 70ac<br />
<br />
15stats/saves 120hp/mana<br />
<br />
10pct lifesteal 3pct shielding, 3pct spellshield<br />
<br />
Focus: Something real useful. :P<br />
<br />
Perhpas at this point, there could be a turning point in the quest, where it starts to get really hard. The above weapon would be Epic 1.5. Now begins the quest to get Epic 2.0, the rest of the augs. Perhaps the weapon itself is complete now, and now you seek to finish entraping the paladins' souls into it to fully power the weapon.<br />
<br />
6th aug: 2dmg 5stats/saves 1pct shielding/spellshield 1pct lifesteal<br />
7th aug: 3dmg 5stats/saves 1pct shielding/spellshield 10ac 1pct lifesteal<br />
8th aug: 4dmg 5stats/saves 1pct shielding/spellsheild 10ac 80hp/mana 1pct lifesteal<br />
9th aug: 5dmg 5stats/saves 1pct shielding/spellshield 10ac 100hp/mana 1pct lifesteal<br />
<br />
And to finsih Epic2.0, the grand finale where you entrap the immortal paladin into the sword:<br />
<br />
10th aug: 6dmg 15stats/saves 1pct shielding/spellshield 10ac 100hp/mana 1pct lifesteal Proc: 450pt lifetap proc with stun and/or instant mana recourse tacked on.<br />
<br />
Epic 2.0 would then be:<br />
<br />
70dmg 30del 2hs 110ac<br />
<br />
50stats/saves 400hp/mana<br />
<br />
15pct Lifesteal 8pct shielding/spellshield<br />
<br />
Proc: 450pt lifetap proc with stun and/or instant mana recourse tacked on<br />
<br />
Focus: Something real useful. :P<br />
<br />
Pulled all numbers/stats out of my hat, just to get the point across. Be nice if the quest was as much fun to do as it was to type up. :P<br />
<br />
This way sub-time non-ubers get what, to them, is a kick-ass weap. Then the buers continue on to get something even MORE kickass, and it all fits into the story.</div></div><hr />

I sort of went crazy and all out with the Epic weapon... but when you define the term Epic, it should be just that..The be all to end all weapon for your character. Nothing should be better than your Epic Weapon. To make a weapon so powerful that you wouldnt need another weapon in your remaining tenure in the game. A weapon that defines everything that you class is about to help them achieve prominence. Of course, I'd expect other classes Epic's to be this insane as well... along with the quest to achieve it... but that's what Epics are meant to be. The culmination of our character forged into a single weapon in which you can destroy any living thing that moves.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Silence</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">this has little to do with the weapon itself... but the aug idea is a very good one... that way its scaleable... making the augments grow in power so the weapon does...  it could stay the epic until eq dies. no need for a 3.0, just  throw another aug in there and a cheesy addin to the quest lore... they're not known for their spectacular lore anyway i doubt anyone would mind.</div></div><hr />

After all Epic 1.0 gave us 2hD Bash for free, so why cant Epic 2 give us Warrior discs and mitigation?<br />
<br />
Oh and inorder to keep this in line the equiv Warrior Epic 2.0 will be a rusty sword swith some gay lightsabre effect to keep them happy...</div></div><hr />

Fuck that, Gandalf is a shitty guild leader, he always gives the phat lewtz to his ranger buddy.  Besides, OOW is going to suck and SOE has no friggin' clue about class balance.  I gave the one ring to control them all to a fire beetle.  See you in WoW.</div></div><hr />

All the signs point to OoW being the best expansion we've seen in a while.</div></div><hr />
