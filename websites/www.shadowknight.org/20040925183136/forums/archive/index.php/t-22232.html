<br />
Necro Rez should be in our spell line at level 65, along with a few more necro spells.... <br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
I would more like to see a way for us to mitigate the amount of damage done to us with the same efficiency as a Palladin does with stuns.<br />
<br />
Maybe a scaleable lifetap AA - dare I say % life tap of some kind based on the SKs Hitpoints?<br />
<br />
Maybe a few AAs to boost all of our lifetaps effectiveness.<br />
<br />
Maybe a few AAs to also improve our casting time with Lifetaps only.<br />
(10%, 25%, and 50% spell haste respectively)  That should help with the channelling problem as well.<br />
<br />
Have healing Focii affect the healing aspect of our Lifetaps as well.<br />
<br />
These are just ideas, troubleshoot them as you will.<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
SCS - Heh, its not our issue - more of an 'all classes' issue.  Any class should be able to toggle it.<br />

if you value your balls i wouldn't dare.<br />
this won't scale with content, it will only scale with hitpoints.<br />
<br />
Maybe a few AAs to also improve our casting time with Lifetaps only.<br />
(10%, 25%, and 50% spell haste respectively) That should help with the channelling problem as well.<br />
<br />
SK detrimental spells already have 45% haste innately, and the spell haste cap is (currently) 50%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Paynreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">How about a % of the mobs max HP<br />
=D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">How about a % of the mobs max HP<br />

<br />
Now you're just being a smartass  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Paynreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Nuh-uh! Just 'cuz we would be able to Cheal ourselves on million-HP mobs doesn't make it unbalanced.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Why, you're RIGHT!<br />
<br />
The answer to this is all obvious! Give us a lifetap that is determined by a % of the mob's hp, but MAKE ALL MOBS HAVE NO MORE THAN 20,000 HP! <br />
<br />
IT'S GENIOUS!!!11!~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Moonslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Maybe a lifetap that scales with the level of the mob?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">A discipline that halves mob attack rate for x seconds.<br />
<br />
ie the mob is paralised in pain from hitting the SK and pauses in shock before its next swing.<br />
<br />
Scales, isnt defensive (multi target) is in charector and will give us enough time to survive till slow lands.<br />
<br />
But im biased cause it was my idea 8)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vengyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If you are looking for an answer to damage mitigation for SKs, i don't think a scaleable lifetap is the answer. Why? Well, try casting a spell when a 3k hitting mob is beating you down. It ain't easy  :rolleyes: <br />
Only way it would work is if the lifetap was a super fast cast spell.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>nytemyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">We could have special aa lifetap that hits for half of whatever max damage the mob does.Gauranteed exceptional heal. 5 min reuse time. This won't be for mitgating damage but it'll be damn cool. Something leech touch should of been like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kanigit007</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">A.  Lets say (Maxed) it goes up to 50% of our health, the refresh is every 6 seconds, and the mana cost is ENOURMOUS. (1000 Mana)  Oh and it can be critted on, of course.<br />
<br />
Imagine that on an 11k Htps SK - just breifly.<br />
<br />
Gives a new meaning to 'standing on our mana'.<br />
<br />
B.  The Spell Haste AA would stack with our Innate Haste, Blessing Spell Haste, and Foci Spell Haste.  Done correctly we could have 1 second LT casts.<br />
<br />
C.  Yes, I can channel through a 3k hit.  But its usually FD.<br />
<br />
-K<br />
<br />
(edit)<br />
<br />
Oh, and this super LT AA doesnt have to have the healing component based upon the damage component - to avoid &quot;Lifeburn&quot; aspects of the arguement.<br />
<br />
Maybe a base DD of 900 then a % heal (like the Druid heal).<br />
<br />
If we fiddle with the concept maybe it will work, don't outright discredit the idea.<br />
<br />
Does it scale?  Yes.  <br />
Does it scale the same way defensive or slow does?  No.<br />
Does it have the possibility of coming in 2nd to a paladin stun? Yes.</div></div><hr />

Wonderful until all new encounters are designed for it (kind of like defensive) and the MOBS have even more insane ATK ratings and no one can do it w/o an SK and then we become part of the holy trinity and...wait maybe I like this idea...No no this just makes us a debuff bitch and I don't want to do that.  Maybe double our mitigation AC for a time....nono there is a point of diminishing returns...ah hell fuck if I know</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Noctix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">How about a discipline that's sort of like a reverse of Divine Arbitration?  So basically, something along the lines of 60 seconds where we take 50% of normal damage and the other 50% is split up evenly among our group members?  I think this would be quite in line with the evil SK vision, causing pain to our entire group.  It would also scale quite well.</div></div><hr />
