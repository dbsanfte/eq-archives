<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As of today (7/06/04), Researcher Kaeon in the PoInnovation factory no longer regens when being beat on. He has approximately 40k HP, so no parse lasts more than 10 minutes on him.<br />
<br />
Is soe cracking down on parse mobs?<br />
<br />
If so, wtf? And why?<br />
<br />
Are my Jboots slower?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Maicom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">this was discussed a while back<br />

<br />
go try the shadowhaven banker, downside is he's green.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Darkmourn D`Estrellas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">After having just helped some rogues get Stanos' head this weekend, I'll mention the chick in the room right next to where Anson is...if you could get her pulled to a zoneline or something, since Anson will probably beat you down.  Her name is Cyrla Shadowstepper.<br />
<br />
With decent AC she wasn't hitting for much at all (although the enchanter got hit for 400's) and she literally has like 5 million hps.  She cons dark blue, supposedly level 61.  I'm not sure you could actually go afk for hours and not expect to die from her, but if you're probably even in high end bazaar gear it's going to take her awhile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xanathol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Anyone recall what the Katta druid bitch NPC cons on the way to Lcea? IIRC, she hits for dick and regens like mad. Been a while though, so may be way off...and she may be green.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Belyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The katta druid is 61 or 66 i believe, just remember her conning yellow back when i was farming lecia.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>bastardlunatic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">begins with a T and last name is honeypot or honeyjar.  Bitch has 5billion hp.  Real pain in the ass when she agros on your little lcea raid.</div></div><hr />

We always trained her away, far away then pulled lcea to the zoneline.</div></div><hr />
