<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ganodoar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey there all. Just wanted to post for two reasons. First off to say that woot got soul leech, dark sword of blood on my 2nd fear raid. Boy oh boy was it a pain. At first the goal was to get the broken golem for a wizzy friend but someone argoed Cazic and he repopped the zone. Here is where things got wierd. Cazic summoned the golems to this side and the golems never ended up returning to their respective temples. Luckily broken repopped strangely and enraged golem died :)<br />
<br />
Now here is the kicker, we went to track the golems but bam out of nowhere Cazic and the demis argoed and wiped out everyone. CR was a pain and we had to get a guild up there to help on the corpse run. Turns out they wanted to do Cazic. At first when I died I did see terror had a sword. Eventually the guild that went up there helped us out and vowed to take out the golems and Cazic. Took long but eventually after many deaths on their part, Terror fell but dropped Bloodfire. <br />
<br />
Next step was to take Dread/Fright out. I was assigned to the Death Touch team. Hehe got death touched by Dread and rezzed back in time to hear someone shout Dread has soul leech. Looted it and said well dying like 5-6 times paid off. By the way, apparently the rogue told me Dread was not wielding it so it could be that the golems may or may not wield it all the time if they have it. Looks like taking 2 death touches from Dread and getting bashed in by Dread was worth it.<br />
<br />
Now for my question. I did search but got no answers. Has anyone here ever seen the decrepit hide drop from hatebone drakes and the ashenbone broodmaster? Reason asking is that lots of guildies want to farm tier 2 for marsinger gem drops and if hides only drop from ashenbones then that will convince them to stay to farm tier 1. So far at 43 ashenbones, 10 hate bones, 1 broodmaster but 0 hides. Hope to hear confirmation on this question :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Moreeta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The hide drops off of Ashenbone drakes ONLY. I'd say it' s possible to get off the named Ashenbone Broodmaster, but can't verify that for sure.<br />
<br />
I got my hide today when a friend in zone sent a tell asking me what it was for.<br />
<br />
Gratz on soul leec and good luck with the hide!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ganodoar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for the reply Moreeta. That is exactly what I thought too. So far up to 63 ashenbone drakes and 1 broodmaster. Broodmaster dropped a crappy necro wand though. The best part about hate is going in and trying to find all the ashenbones on track. I did what most sks did and camped the broodmaster spot since the ph is always a drake. A bright side about this camp is it doesn't take too long to learn how to get to the drake house from the entrance of hate. In fact I led my group to the drake house and it took me a minute to realize that. Also another bright side is at least the broodmaster can drop Shattered Emerald of Corruption. I have 2 ranger guildies who need that still.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Moreeta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">HEHEHE The SEoC drops about as much as the hide. <br />
<br />
Okay, it drops WAY more than the hide.<br />
<br />
I just got my hide the other day. A friend was camping the stairs at the church pulling nameds to get the SEoC for his ranger alt and he sends me a tell asking if i know what a &quot;decrepit hide&quot; is for. About crapped myself and nearly got killed getting to it. :)<br />
<br />
Time from zone in to stairs, in under 3 seconds. :)<br />
<br />
I think I left skid marks I took off so fast.<br />
<br />
Good hunting!! It WILL drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ganodoar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hahah with all these people saying they are getting hides from the drakes on the steps I almost peed myself when I saw a drake on the stairs. Of course no hide. So far, moreeta, up to 85 ashenbones in 4 trips. 0 hides, 1 ashenbone abassi and 3 minor signets of the dark priest. We have seen the ashenbone broodmaster 3 times but he has dropped the wand of souls. That wand with 3 charges of instant cast drain soul. Wish we could use that.<br />
Well at least this beats having to camp Quillmane. I figure either way I will get the hide before the SEOC since we are only camping the broodmaster and the guildies know how rare the hide is. Unlike Quillmane, at least hate is fun and the xp is great up there. Surprisingly hate has made me a few new friends who are willing to help up there. Hard to beleive the decrepit hide camp is forming new friendships :)<br />
<br />
Gratz on the hide. What drake number was that? Do you remember? Or you didn't take count like I am doing LOL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Amphitryon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I got lucky..went up to Hate twice after the revamp, got the hide after maybe an hour up there on the second trip</div></div><hr />
