<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>oukubok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK - Ive got this level 19 SK. Im wearing my newb armor and a few bits of leather to fill in the holes. Im on RZ, and I dont have alot of money so Im not really looking to upgrade my gear much.<br />
<br />
Ive been in PC for the last 6 levels or so, and Im just sick to death of the place. <br />
So and So calls Such and such  a name, such and such tells so and so that he only won because he was buffed, so and so denies being buffed - repeat for hours.<br />
I cant stand it anymore.<br />
<br />
Can anyone recommend a nice spot for a 19 ogre to pick up some levels? Im thinking of heading off to oveethere, but Ive done it before on another server and Id like to see something new</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ramgar SK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hmmm, seems you are the perfect level for bandit camps in PC.  This shouldn't take you more than a few hours to get to 25 and out of PC forever.<br />
<br />
But, if you really want somewhere else to hunt, go to Kurns tower and hunt downstairs.  Or you can head to the Warrens or Befallen.  They all have a great exp bonus.<br />

Get used to ignoring jerks in EQ, they spawn way too often.</div></div><hr />
