Yeah well you forget that people that already hate Bush don't care that Michael Moore isn't a truthful person and will go see this movie simply to reinforce their positions.  People who already hate Bush will not judge this movie on its merits and its truthfullness but on its ability to spin events to make Bush look as bad as possible.

Michael Moore is the best thing the USA currently has to offer on the political stage. The way he communicates things is not perfect, but he catches the people's attention with his style.

 way to go soldier, you tell us citizens how to live our lives. if you did what you did for the absolute freedom of the citizens of america well then you should respect his right to be what he wants to be and say what he wants to say, but i bet you just do it because you get payed too.</div></div><hr />

Americans don't take kindly to Europeans telling them what they should and shouldn't watch.  We have this thing called freedom where we get to decide what we want to watch without people having to tell us.  Michael Moore is a proven liar and taking his &quot;documentary&quot; as fact is ill-advised.  I'm not surprised Europeans are big fans of his.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Moore IS a proven liar, but I'm glad he exists and is making his movies.  I haven't seen this one, but most certainly it is so heavily slanted to his desired point of view that calling it a documentary is stretching the definition a bit.  Regardless, it is still good to have people willing to express opinions that do not coincide with what many would consider the popular view.  It certainly causes controversy and causes people to argue and hopefully think about what is going on.<br />
<br />
Is Moore right?  Probably not completely.  Is Fox News right?  Well, right-wing certainly, but also probably not completely correct and not completely incorrect.  Somewhere inbetween is where the truth can be found, and people just have to make their own decisions.<br />
<br />
For those serving in our military, you're doing an outstanding job, though by my understanding often without the necessary support.  I'm pretty sure that at least 95% of our military serving overseas would much rather be home than be in Iraq or Afghanistan or The Persian Gulf or The Red Sea.  Here's hoping that you all come back safe.<br />
<br />
What's sad is that I think John Kerry might be the one politician the Democrats coudl have chosen who couldn't just stand up in front of America, go &quot;I'm not George W. Bush&quot;, and win.  This is going to be a very tough election for many people to choose a candidate on, at least from what I have seen so far.  We might just set a new record for voter apathy if we're not careful.</div></div><hr />

Don't presume what is best for the United States, you Eurotrash pos.  Rush Limbaugh caught the public's attention with the same flamboyant showman &quot;all about me&quot; style, and he was full of shit too.  I'll bet you wouldn't recommend his show (if you ever even listened to it), just on the principle that he doesn't spew your personal views.  Both are extremeist wackos who abuse the entertainment industry to get the public to accept their fucked-up views.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Nulladar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Moore IS a proven liar <br />
Really? Could you post some of the thing he has lied about or things in his films/books that were lies? I hear conservatives constantly saying this bull shit but they can never back it up.<br />
<br />
And too the person that said &quot;Bush is going to win hands down&quot; no president in US history has had a rating as low as Bush's at this point in the election and went on to win.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Rhumba_Kween</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">My biggest problems with Michael Moore are:<br />
<br />
1) His proven track record of over-editing interviews. Meaning that he heavily edits peoples responses to make them sound like they said that they said something they did not. It was done in Bowling for Columbine and and one example in the new Propumentary was his question to a House Member from Minnesota, where he asked a question to him, and then did not play his response making it look like he did not have a response. If you have to edit peoples responses to make your point, can you really trust the point you are making? Not in my Book.<br />
2) His double sided approach to the Pre-War Iraq. He paints the picture that everything was fine in Iraq prior to the war. Does anyone believe that? Where are the mass graves? Where are the interviews with the family members that lost family members to the Iraq Gulag. Where are the interviews with the family members whose daughters were raped by Saddam's Son because he could? Where is the discussion about the Assasination attempt on George Bush Senior when he was in Kuwait by Sadamms bodyguard? Back to my point, why did Michael Moor feel the need to paint a Rosey picture on the Pre-War Iraq. Do you really believe that was the case? If you don't believe that, how can you believe his point in this Propumentary? Maybe Hitler's Information minister was right, if you repeat lies often enough, the masses will start to believe them?<br />
3) Michael moore has a two sided approach to the War itself. On one had he argues that the War was wrong in the first place, and in the same breath he says that we did not send enough troops and we did not use a strong enough hand in the occupation. How can he have it both ways. It's very easy to attack a President during a War. Lets face it, War's suck.<br />
4) Michael Moore believed that nothing should be done to Osama Bin Laden untill he had a trial... How can you believe anything this guy says, when he's willing to overlook someone who admitted to doing something, simply because he'd not had a trial?<br />
<br />
Let's face it, Michael Moore is in the same boat as many of the Ultra Conservative Entertainers, Ann Koulter, Fred Savage and Rush Limbaugh. The only difference is that the Media tends to be more in love with the Television Arts, and therefore he gets more coverage than the Conservative kooks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
OK, since you asked so nicely.<br />
<br />
Heston Interview (http://www.bowlingfortruth.com/bowlingforcolumbine/scenes/hestoninterview.htm) <br />
<br />
That is an example of what Moore did in one of his films.  Keep in mind that this is a very biased representation of the interview with Heston, but then again that interview is shown in a heavily biased way in the film, so perhaps it evens out.  Anyway, read the article and you can see that there are undoubtedly mistruths at the very least in the way the interview is presented in the movie.</div></div><hr />

Sure, Canada does have its share of diversity, but to the best of my knowledge it isn't anything like the scale to which the USA has.

That's what we do here in the USA and I wouldn't have it any other way. That doesn't mean I have to agree with him. But like the majority of assholes you just skim over the surface and take the meaning you want. I've got 20 years in the military and I don't need snot nosed bitches like you telling me why I do what I do. You type words but do you do anything about your beliefs? I believe I do and have. And how am I telling anyone how to live their lives? I believe my opinion is all I wrote, not a guide for assholes to live their life by. So, when you decide to do a day in a soldiers life you will have room to talk about us and why we serve. Until that time it's all just wasted oxygen coming out of your mouth. <br />

I think by saying &quot;if you did what you did for the absolute freedom of the citizens of america&quot; he meant that you wouldn't be doing it if it wasn't paying, and I doubt you would.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Aoninie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">So who does any job for free? Kind of a stupid thing to say. Doesn't make sence to me.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>derakolwtf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">the point is, I doubt you do what you do because you care about me or my freedom. So dont call me a snot nosed bitch cause i didnt choose to be a soldier. Dont pretend everyone elses life is so easy because they are not a soldier. Being a soldier makes you not a damn bit better than I am. Voice your opinion all you want but why do you need to mention that &quot; your a soldier&quot;. It gives your argument no more credibility than mine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Actually there is some merit to any military member saying they do what they do for reasons of beliefs such as patriotism and the want and desire to defend America's constitution.<br />
<br />
I have been in the military for 10 years, it pays for shit. So you can say we wouldn't do it if it didn't pay and yes that is true (how would anyone pay their bills if they got zero money, duh) but it pays ALOT less then many many comparable jobs in the civilian sector and yet we still choose to do it.<br />
<br />
There is no overtime for working 12 hours a day, 7 days a week during exercises and deployments, there is no compensation for giving up certain freedoms like free speech or the ability to move as you please. There are alot of sacrifices made by the men and women in uniform that only others that have served in uniform can understand. We do these things for love of country, for the idea of defending the Constitution of the United States and the freedoms that it gives to American citizens, and for the noble and honorable tradition that is military service and giving back to a greater cause than ones own personal gain.<br />
<br />
And before someone says &quot;you still have the freedom of speech just the consequences have changed.&quot; Telling your XO or Commander to &quot;fuck off&quot; for example can be punished as a crime in the military as can not coming to work. In the civilian sector you might lose your job but you aren't guilty of breaking a law.</div></div><hr />

Once again you place your foot in your uninformed mouth. How dare you as someone who's probably never served any purpose bigger than himself presume to know why we in the uniformed services do what we do. And in this I include Police officers and Firefighters. Syfon, thanks. Your words ring so very true with the majority of us in uniform. The majority of us in the service don't do it for the amount of pay we get. We do it because we believe in what we do. How dare you, for one moment, belittle us for the service we give you all. Everyday we and our families sacrifice more than you will ever know. Some giving the ultimate sacrifice. What sacrifices have you made for your country and fellow man? Why do I say that I am a soldier...because I am proud of what I do and to let people like you know that I don't just speak out my ass. I have been there, I am still here, I live my beliefs. Am I better than you? I don't presume to be. A snot nose bitch? That means by your posts I feel you are young, or at the very least naive. It apparently doesn't matter how I or anyone else explains things to you as you probably already have your mind made up. You are what some of us refer to as sheeple. You blindly allow the cause of the moment to lead you blindly. Open your eyes and see things for yourself and carve your own path.<br />
<br />
Oskuro, it is easy to talk about killing when you have never seen it for real. The last thing a soldier wants is to have to aim his weapon at another human and pull the trigger. But if neccessary we will and do. Someone has to. And you should thank us that are willing to put it all on the line for you. <br />
<br />
I don't expect you that haven't served to understand why we do what we do. But don't put us down for it.</div></div><hr />

Let's see; We deploy for a year away from our families where we dodge Improvised Explosive Devices, morters, rockets, and small arms fire almost daily. We normally work in excess of 12 hour days. Those of us that are married leave our spouses to become both mother and father for our children, usually in areas where they have no support from family. And we do this for meager pay and dwindling benefits. We put our lives on hold as we are involuntarily extended into service. We miss birthdays, anniverseries, or kids first day at school, Christmas and other Holidays. And no, I don't buy it that everyone does something for their country. When you can stand up and sacrifice what we in the military do on a daily basis then perhaps you have room to talk. Once again I say that I don't feel better than anyone here. But people like you who belittle us in the service for what we do just piss me off to no end. Remember you have the right to speak your mind and spread your music because of people like me and my family who are willing to do what the majority of America can't or won't do. Does that make me better than anyone, no. Just different. Do I always agree with what we do, no. But it is my job to follow the orders of our Commander in Chief as long as they are legal and lawful. But most of all it is my job to ensure America's sons and daughters come home in something other than a flag draped coffin.</div></div><hr />

Let's see; We deploy for a year away from our families where we dodge Improvised Explosive Devices, morters, rockets, and small arms fire almost daily. We normally work in excess of 12 hour days.

 Its your job and its something you signed up to do, so making the argument that it is very hard and dangerous really doesnt matter since it is your choice.Yes i understand you sacrifice your life, I think we all get that. Just because i chose not to do so for a cause I dont believe does not mean i have no room to talk. Believe it or not there are worse situations for the citizens of america then being in a war. And most of these people did not volunteer to be in them. In some way everyone makes this country what it is, it isnt all about the military. It can be good, bad, whatever your opinion is. My point is bringing up the fact that your a soldier and using it in an argument is pointless. Soldiers and citizens have opinions. Neither one is better than the other one.</div></div><hr />

&quot;The Iraqis who have risen up against the occupation are not 'insurgents' or 'terrorists' or 'The Enemy.'  They are the REVOLUTION, the Minutemen, and their numbers will grow, and they will win&quot;.  --Michael Moore, April 2004</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Dignitas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Michael Moore is a proven liar  <br />
<br />
*Yawn*<br />
<br />
Number of people that have sued him: 0 (In words: Zero)<br />
<br />
What he says cant be so untrue, because as far as I remember, slander is not legal in your country.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">You can tell the partial truth and it doesn't count as a lie so to say that Moore is a liar is untrue, but to say that he shows the true view of things or that he tells the complete truth is inaccurate.  See my previous post where I took words from one response of yours and reorganised them, it's a golden example of Moore style story telling (and thats what he twists it into, a story).  Every word thats said is true but not in the correct order and not in the correct context.  This movie of his like everything else he does lacks numerous small pieces of truth that DRAMATICALLY alter the way it looks.  If Bush was as bad as Moore (or many countries in the world) think he is, why does the US allow him to remain in power?  Theres 3 reasons citizens in the US have the right to bear arms and the gun control laws we have exist.<br />
<br />
Reason 1: If any country attempts to invade the US the entire population is instantlly transformed into an armed militia.<br />
Reason 2: If the citizens feel that the president of the country is doing a bad job and needs to be removed and can't be done through political means, he can be removed by force.<br />
Reason 3: Freedom to do what we want as long as it doesn't impact others.  To paraphrase something from Lincoln, I can swing my fist around as much as I want provided I don't hit someone.<br />
<br />
Now tell me, if Bush is doing such a bad job why is he still in office?  Moore must not be telling the complete truth, and he doesn't even have to because he can play it off as artistic freedom if/when (he probally has been by now) he's called on it.  Also, the way the rest of the world views us right now is a GOOD thing, you people in other countries that don't approve can kiss my ass, if we told you how to live you wouldn't like it, the fact that the UN won't do what it says it will is further proof towards the apathy that seems common in other countries right now.  Places like England, France, Russia, these are countries that have always been strong (yes even France... they did have Napoleon and Joan of Arc for example), it's sad to see the way those countries don't stand up for themselves now and let 3rd world countries dictate their policies and ensure they aren't in their best interests.<br />

Wrong, Bill O'Reilly is considering taking legal action for false comments Moore made in a press conference about him.  <br />
<br />
The fact of the matter is that your Messiah Michael Moore just received support and offers from help from a terrorist organization responsible for killing hundreds of innocent women and children.  What a great guy Michael Moore is.</div></div><hr />

I think what you're beginning to see now is a backlash against Michael Moore from people who have seen F9/11 and from people who are tired of the political bomb-throwing by people who hate America.  People are tired of the muckraking and would like to see an honest debate, which is something Michael Moore doesn't want.  <br />
<br />
People who hate Bush and who hate America will still go see this movie, but each day new revelations about Moore and his views are becoming public.  I find it interesting how the European community (and terrorist organizations) are strongly supporting this movie.  Americans are growing very tired of the anti-America sentiment in Europe, and this is not a good thing for Europe.  Eventually the Europeans will come around and see us as an ally and ask for our support, but I fear that by then too much damage will have been done and Americans will not be willing to help those who have worked so hard to undermine them.</div></div><hr />

I'd be convinced if you gave me your source of information.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  To assume that Bush would hold off until then so he would get a boost in the polls is very misguided.  Bin laden is the Al Quaeda spiritual and operational leader, and as long as he is alive he can help conduct terrorist attacks against us in Iraq, Afghanistan, and the US.  As long as those attacks are going on, they hurt Bush in the polls.  If we captured him now, the attacks in general wouldn't stop, but that would be a serious blow to Al Quaeda and the attacks could die down.  Anyway, I could be wrong but that's my opinion on that subject.  If you have a source of info that says otherwise let me know.</div></div><hr />

Not convinced by sources, just a feeling I have.  It is certainly risky politically, but it may not even be politically motivated.  Just seems like the hunt would step up even further this year (for political reasons).</div></div><hr />
