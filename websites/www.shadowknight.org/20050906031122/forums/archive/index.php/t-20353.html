I was wondering if it's better to give our pets a weapon once we summon them?  If it is, then is there a point where you no longer need to do this for the pets?  <br />
<br />
I spent all my time in EQ playing a cleric.  I quit EQ for about a year from the boredom of healing.  My friends kept telling me about how nice the LDON adventures were so now I'm back and playing a SK for a change of pace.  I'm really loving the class and I enjoy all the info I have gathered from this forum so far.  <br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

As far as a fine steel over it just hitting?  Seems to not make much difference.  Only time I give him stuff is when I just want him to look cool.  Unless spells and stuff can put him over it, Mr. Bones is caped at how much dmg he can do depending on the pet.  Can do a search for pet information, somebody had a nice chart of all the stats.</div></div><hr />

<br />
my favorites Defenders Lightblade or Weighty Polearm just for show.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is a damage threshold you need to cross to make your pet do more damage then his punch would.  If I remeber it right, it's not cost effective at all.<br />
<br />
That pet chart needs to be stickied.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dester</div><div class="date">03-02-2004, 10:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">At the lower levels it is good to give skinny a weapon, especially untill he duel wields.<br />
<br />
Untill he duel wields give him a 2h weapons that has a damage of more then 50% of his current max hit.<br />
<br />
Once he starts to duel wield, giveing him weapons besides mage summon weapons for stats is kinda a moot point.<br />

<br />
Searching for pet* yields a lot of info.<br />
<br />
It was mentioned that 49+ pet always dual wields, so you don't need to give him 2 weapons to make him do so.  I've never parced the two out, so I don't know.</div></div><hr />

It would be really nice info to have for sure.  I'm one of those types of people that sits and reads everything he can find on a class so I know once I start getting up in levels I should be doing a pretty good job.   Thanks for the info everyone.<br />
