<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bainin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">With WA not looking like a very good path for GoD AA as an sk, I spent some points on the bash AA's (just 1st level in each)<br />
<br />
<br />
I was wondering-beside the venerable &quot;mob x casting is interrupted&quot;, is there a switch somewhere which would provide an emote telling me that a bash successfully stunned?<br />
<br />
<br />
Furious Bash 1 seems to have a range of 6 to 41 damage for me.<br />
<br />
<br />
that is all !<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grimknot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well I'll say WA is defiantly worth getting but I'm curious to the bash aa's too.  Any details/parsing on these AA's yet?  Worth it or about as useful as the pet buff AA?</div></div><hr />

<br />
At level (1) I was interrupting like 1/5 and at level (3) I am closer to 1/3 for interrupts on the casters in the LDoN Hards.<br />
<br />
I would count the number of times I tried to interrupt a caster and how many times I was successful and keep a little running total.  Thankfully I was counting this in LDoN runs with my normal crew where we had no other classes able to stun so it was fairly easy to identify when a bash was directly responsible for the interrupt.<br />
<br />
I know it works on the mobs up to level 65 very well...after that I am not sure.  Brael mentioned once that he had not noticed any level cap......but that was at the beginning of his GoD hunting days so not sure what level trash he was fighting and if that is still the case.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tumy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Does Immobilising Bash work with large race slam ability?  Since it says bash (Bash normaly requires a sheild) in the name, I didnt want to spend the AA's only to find out that it doesnt work with Slam.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lynxal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It works with 2-hand Bash AA, but since I am Iksar I am not sure about the slam.</div></div><hr />

How so? Also,the face on your sig really bothers me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Cyrielle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Beacause at WA5 you get 14 % less MH procs , not that huge but i prefer more MH procs than Greatblade ones.<br />
I would probably end up getting WA5 too since there is really nothing to spend AA's on but really not in a hurry</div></div><hr />

It's always been the lack of hands in her sig that freaked me out</div></div><hr />
