Hold flames I have looked at other posts but my equipment is not shabby.  Looking for suggestions?<br />
<br />
Plus should I AA split xp or just lvl to 65 and then AA xp?  Pro or con on AA xp split at 59.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nimic</div><div class="date">03-17-2004, 12:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From 58-62 I did the High Justices in Plane of Justice.  They are level 60 mobs and provide reasonably good experience.  AA exp is about 5% per kill at level 60 - which is incredible.  If I could do it all again, I would have sat at the high justices at level 60 and knocked out most of my defensive AA.    Once you get good at killing the High Justices, you can expand into Mav Hall for OK experience but lots of gems while waiting for respawn.<br />

When I hit 62 I went to halls of honor till 65 - its mostly empty on my server and relatively safe and train free (though a dragon did get trained through my camp once, its a relatively rare occurance).</div></div><hr />

It's a toss up what to do with AA's.  It depends a lot on your play style and guild.<br />
<br />
I solo and pull for my guild a lot.  So I decided to get run3 right away.  It really slowed down the already painfully slow leveling.  So I moved my AA percent from 10% to 90% depending on my mood.  By 55 I had run 3.  Then I wanted more regen so I knocked out another AA and bought regen 1 by 58.  Then I heard many many people saying that you must get to 65, and then AA because the exp is so much better.  So I did.  Now it's nice not to consider splitting exp, it all goes to AA's.<br />
<br />
One huge factor is what the AA's give you compared to a level.  At 51, it costs you a whole level to buy one AA!  It gets a little better with each level you get.  At 65 it doesn't cost you any levels.<br />
<br />
Run3 seems to be very worth while IMO.  Very useful when there is no SoW.  It has saved my life many times.  But if you don't solo much, and you are always in a guild group, you can skip it and push to 65.  If I did it all over again, I'd get 58, switch 100% to AA and get run 3, then get 65.</div></div><hr />
