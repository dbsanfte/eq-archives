<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ronoh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was on second floor screwing around trying to spawn lumpy and I got the no drop wire off a coerced dwarf.  I gave the wire to the prisoner and it stated:<br />
<br />
an iksar prisoner takes the wire and quickly saws through the rested shackles.  He hands you an icon and says as he runs off, 'Show that to the Arch Duke in Cabilis! He will reward you. Now I'm off to escape!'<br />
<br />
I got experience from freeing the prisoner.<br />
<br />
I figured I had some time before raiding and head to Cabilis to turn in the Greenmist Icon to Arch Duke Xog.<br />
<br />
So... I hand the icon to Arch Duke and this is what it said:<br />
<br />
Arch Duke Xog takes the icon and stares at it.  His face twists into a look of disdain and he suddenly throws the icon off the balcony. It lands in the water some distance away.  Without even a glance at you he says in disgust, 'You're an idiot, Ronoh. You fit your profession well. Leave me sight.'<br />
<br />
Your faction standing with Crusaders of Greenmist got worse.<br />
Your faction standing with Legion of cabilis got worse.<br />
<br />
/boggle<br />
<br />
anyone know what this is about?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>yuggoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Lots of stuff in Dalnir's was suspected to be part of the *original* greenmist quest that never got finished.  They finally got tired of us complaining and whipped out a quicky version that was prety unrelated.<br />
<br />
I would love to know what the original quest was supposed to be like.. and what the eventual reward would have been.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>QUECHAL</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">that guy is for the iksar warrior 'crafted' bracers quest. the arch duke sends the warior there to find out what happened. when you find him and learn that he was captured, you are supposed to kill him for being weak and turn in his heart with whatever gems are needed for that one. <br />
<br />
he calls you an idiot cause the SK's and the warriors in cabalis don't particularly like eachother ( like the army and the marines)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Darknyss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yah, it's basically what you get for handing in things blindly... if you knew the story behind his actions, you should have killed him and taken his heart.. not freed him...<br />
<br />
kinda cool that they add depth to these quests sometimes... not exactly the shocker of talking to the Djinn in Temple of Ro... but in a way... it does make sense!</div></div><hr />
