<br />
BUUUUUUUUT, my lady begged me to go see his movie this past weekend, and I have to say, as far as movies go, it wasn't half-bad at all.<br />
<br />
Would I go see it again?<br />
Only with duct-tape.<br />
<br />
But seeing it once was decent. There's a few good comical points, and he DOESN'T sit there singing gangsta-rap shit the entire time (like I thought it would be)...<br />
<br />
Oh, and Kim Bassinger being a friggin' hottie might also have had something to do with it, and I think she's funny in this flick, as well.<br />
<br />
Anyway, sorry to de-rail the topic, but hey, it's a flame board, so flame me if ya want! :)<br />

<br />
Kim Basinger as a hottie in that movie???<br />
<br />
Just my opinion here but to me she looked like the broken-down-white-trash-ghetto-assed-drunk-whore-living-in-a-busted-up-rented-trailer that she was playing.<br />
<br />
Sure, she's still got a mildly attractive figure, I suppose, for a woman of close to 50... but she seriously looked strung out in 8mile...  I was more interested in the other whore chick that was in it, forget her name, the one he did in the factory.   Gone are the days of Basinger's Blind Date (or Cool World) hotness...<br />
<br />
/sigh,  it's the end of an age.<br />

I'd take Kim &quot;broken-down-white-trash-ghetto-assed-drunk-whore-living-in-a-busted-up-rented-trailer&quot; Bassinger over that other blonde skank ANY day of the week.<br />
<br />
Of course Groff, that could be because I might be a bit closer to Kim's age than you by a decade or two.  ;)<br />
<br />
Bul</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Groff Gorespiller</div><div class="date">11-13-2002, 04:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That is entirely possible Bul, but she's still not quite old enough to be my mom (at least not without F#@k'd up socio-economic conditions intervening on her behalf), so it's not that she's just old... <br />
<br />
Hell, I think Raquel Welch looks damn good for her age (she has to be 60 something).  It's that Kim looked as if, along with her career, her life has started the long slow slide into the gutter.  I haven't seen her in anything else in quite some time, so sure, she may have just played a part well... <br />
<br />
As for the other skank, yah, her character was dirty and kinda made my stomach turn a bit, and she does almost look a little too young for even my tastes, but I've seen her in other flicks and she can have a really sweet homegrown look to her too...<br />
<br />
And now that I've just hijacked this thread more than it ever needed to be, I think I'll just go fantasize about a nice, safe subject like Liv Tyler...<br />

I dunno... My own mother is 35.  I'd have a hard time dating someone who could have been my own babysitter.  (Well... not like I had a real babysitter... unless you could the rolled up pairs of socks I had to lay next to inside the dresser drawer)</div></div><hr />

I'd give them 3pp and tell them to find a vendor before they log.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bone thugs and Harmony and Eminem. First Eminem never raps with his ganta style crap that most rappers do, other then that rest was all opinion and wont agree or disagree.<br />
<br />
Movie was good, IMO and was well played. Mica Phiffer deffinantly a whore in the movie.</div></div><hr />

Ulrich would be played by Micheal Keaton,  while Lars himself would play James Hetfield, and a large black man would be the guitarist.<br />

God would play Cliff Burton.</div></div><hr />
