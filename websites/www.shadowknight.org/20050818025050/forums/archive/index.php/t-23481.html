I am very well equipted but can't find a good place to solo.  Any info will be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keevel</div><div class="date">11-08-2004, 09:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">49-51 fear kite skellies in DL pyramids (near the port in site)<br />
49-54 fear kite poachers in jagged pine</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saenayil Shadowraith</div><div class="date">11-08-2004, 05:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nobles in HHK, if your well equiped, tank em, if you cant tank em, clear the guards in the area and fear kite them, very easy and fast XP spot 45-55</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Culdahl1</div><div class="date">11-08-2004, 05:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do the gnomes in echo caverns 'till 51 then head to highpass keep and fear-kite the nobles and bards...the loot is nice and the XP is good till 56ish (I was still doing nobles at 58...though they were LB, you could kill them quickly and XP was nice when LFG).<br />
<br />
edit - that was a while ago and current equip. might allow you to straight tank these mobs as saenayil mentioned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fallgore</div><div class="date">11-09-2004, 12:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I liked at lvl 49 the following:<br />
Ldons/Advs<br />
PoJ<br />
PoI<br />
Cobalt Scar (Made some pp w/decent exp)<br />
and<br />
Rock Hoppers in Dsp.<br />
<br />
Thoughs are the places I went, buy PoI was my fav. on just straight exp, but PoJ is great from 46-49 normally, forgot what exp was like at 49, PoI was where I normally was or Ldons/CS heh.<br />
Would occasionally see me at Hoppers if there was NO grps in PoJ or PoI (I know, it seems hard to believe), but Hoppers were good exp and give some nice cash too if you go trader/sell stuff heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marruk</div><div class="date">11-09-2004, 02:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How, exactly, do you do LDoN solo?<br />
<br />
I can't say PoJ or PoI solo at 49 sounds right, either.<br />
<br />
Fallgore, some friendly advice:<br />
stop posting, and just read until you have a better idea of what you are talking about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saenayil Shadowraith</div><div class="date">11-09-2004, 04:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For PoJ soloing at 49, Id reccomend pulling the rats on the far right side of the prisoners cells with a MELEE attack, no spells or the monk will aggro! Once you pull them, drop snare on, keep the thing snared or your dead, use your lowest level fear and keep them kited, thats my info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marruk</div><div class="date">11-09-2004, 04:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had heard fear was nerfed in PoJ a while ago....<br />
<br />
Edit: nm, Saenayil... I forgot you are on the Mac server.  Kript, however, is not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saenayil Shadowraith</div><div class="date">11-10-2004, 08:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">sorry, forgot about that, for some reason i was thinking it was for sentry's only. If your well enough geared you could easily tank em and with KEI keep yourself healed. You can always do /who all shaman 47 52 and see if they want a duo, you can take down almost anything at the exit with a shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fallgore</div><div class="date">11-10-2004, 08:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alright, sorry for that, meant Grouping in Ldon, you all should know what I mean on that one, and same with PoJ, I did occasionally solo there at 49, but it is HARD.<br />
<br />
And PoI, you group there too ;)<br />
<br />
Sorry for the misleading info., but thought most ppl would've known that you have to group in those areas *grin*.<br />
<br />
GL on getting lvls :D<br />
Should be 60 by end of this week....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marruk</div><div class="date">11-10-2004, 08:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, Fallgore, but the whole point of the thread was to find spots to SOLO in, so suggesting spots where you can't, in fact, solo effectively (or at all), adds useless or misleading information to the thread.<br />
<br />
Most people would know that they need groups in these zones.  Just like most people should know that when the title of a thread is &quot;49 Solo&quot;, and the poster is asking specifically for Solo spots, suggesting several areas to group in is an indication that you aren't paying attention.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fallgore</div><div class="date">11-10-2004, 09:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alright then, so at 49:<br />
Hoppers in Dsp<br />
Hill Giants in Rathe Mts.<br />
PoJ<br />
Cobalt Scar (Drakes are best/nameds)<br />
<br />
Marruk, you love to flame ppl don't you?<br />
Just givin additional info too on better exp anyways, but you can always solo in spots, seen a 62 Rng solo in PoI, but that's a rng cause they can root/snare while hittin w/bows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marruk</div><div class="date">11-10-2004, 10:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, its not that I love to flame people.  Its just that when people who don't know what they are talking about give bad advice, I sometimes try to correct it.  I have tried really hard to resist flaming you, since your intentions seem to be to try and help.  But in the past few days, you've posted a lot of nonsense, and very little useful information.  If you don't know wtf you are talking about, don't post.</div></div><hr />
