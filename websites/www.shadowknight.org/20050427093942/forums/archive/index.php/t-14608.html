<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gaklaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">yeah i made one of innoruuk but not sure of one thing..ive asked many many high lvl people that are ogre or troll sks about what to put the 20 pts in..and im not sure. i want to solo a lot, and get groups too, but im a solo guy or at least want to do what makes me most efficient solo. so should i put all 20 pts in int? also if i wanted to be a grouper should i still put em in int or in something else? thanks in advance :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>law696</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">big race take int<br />
<br />
make sure agi like 75 but ull want int for soloing u big race already got phat physical stats</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>artyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">if your planning on using a fungi/lodi you might wanna pump your agi past 75, unless you have extra agi gear, but those two will kill your agi. but yea, otherwise go INT, trolls are stupider than ogres, and thats a hard task to accomplish! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gaklaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">lol yeah, well trolls agi is 83 base so no worries just all int? even for group oriented (even tho i will solo mainly)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>artyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i had that question too. you got good sta, you got good str, your weak point in starting stats is int, boost that bia bia up. gear will do the rest, because hey, if you run out of mana, your just a warrior with an occational ht :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brainbiter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Put the points in Intelligence - Mana is the the only thing I sit waiting on when I am soloing and the only thing I am short of when grouping - and I put the 20 in int hehe!<br />
<br />
Might want to re-think religion though no one seems to make Innoruuk worshiping troll cultural armour on Bristlebane, my only regret was not worshiping Casic thule! :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tumy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">A large mana poll is only as good as the mana regen that you have....<br />
<br />
When you are soloing a person with 100Int will use the same amount of mana casting the same spells as somone with 255Int. <br />
<br />
Its all about the mana regen...<br />
<br />
Only time it pays to have a huge mana pool is when you:<br />
<br />
 - Get a add...but thats why we have FD<br />
<br />
 - Raid<br />
<br />
If you dont plan on doing much raiding in the future dont worry about Int.  My Int is pretty low and I have no problem with mana durring thos long raid fights</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Hekk Fire</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Couldn't tell you if there is a BETTER setup, but I put all my points into INT, and it works great for me.   I used to solo a lot, but lately have been grouping more.  I usually don't have KEI and I don't miss it.  I'm pretty lazy and will usually run around with minimal buffs.  That's fine most of the time, and I have the option of working harder for some tougher fights if I need to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Calamity_Daemon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Alright just pump it into INT thats what I did. I solo quite a bit and DONT FORGET TO PRACTICE 2HB. Man I did and now I have a deathbringers rod and 30/40 and got a skill of 26. Pshew o well at least my 2hs is 180 or something...i got a Velium etched axe and that works great 30/38. But I worship Inny too because I thought that it would let me train with the SKs in Neriak but whatever works I guess...i got some fine armor and it isnt culteral and remember its INNY'S CURSE not CAZIC's.. *grin*grin have fun man GL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gaklaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">wow thank you all very much for your time and help :D have fun everyone</div></div><hr />
