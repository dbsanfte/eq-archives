<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Caktis1981</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">If anyone has had a similier problem please post solution or if ya have any ideas. I havnt played eq for few days then this patch happened. I logged in just fine at first, then when I went to log on my charector on charector select screen, it tried to load but then just stayed black for like 20 minutes w/ that dammed annoying music playing hehe. So only thing I could do was do a inproper shut down. Since then I cant even get to the accept/decline screen. It gives me error message that reads &quot;Everqeust was unable to initialize the file EQMAIN.DLL&quot; I tried rebooting, and I have tried deleting this file, but I always get the same error message when I try an log in. Any suggestions would be great help, I kinda person that tries to put off actually contacting them for tech help til last resort.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lurker99</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I believe EQMAIN.DLL is needed to connect you to the patch server. If it's bad/corrupt/missing you need to get a new one, it will not automatically download one, since it can't connect to the patch server.<br />
<br />
I think that file is on the install cd's, not 100% sure.</div></div><hr />
