<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cirulik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone evaluated whether this pops us on the Rampage hate list the way an early heal would?  I ask because I cast a Terror aggro multilier on MT as soon as he acquired Grummy, and after the Rampage ordering had touched him, I moved it to assist and was nearly immediately Rampaged.<br />
<br />
The next pass, Voice was active, I cast that, and didn't have teh problem.  Right now I am conjecturing that casting terror after MT has targeted mob somehow acts the way a heal would, targets the caster (and it is possible he had fired an arrow - I'm not sure).<br />
<br />
Any info appreciated -- WOW the fat one hits hard!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Greggthegrmreapr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">well, as far as i know, casting a terror line spell on another PC will do shit, as it only makes the mob hate the SK who casts it more.  the only aggro control spell we have that can affect others directly is the voice line.  Unless i am totally mistaken about the whole thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mordeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I believe Ciriluk is talking about the voice line (as he mentions casting it on the MT)<br />
<br />
Casting anything on the mt will put you on the rampage list if you don't have rampage tanks plinking the Mob with arrows. It's also not something specific to the Voice line of spells, pop any buff on and I believe you'll be put on the list.. (assuming you are the first to buff him)<br />
<br />
You may have only noticed now, cuz the voice line is one of 2 (as far as i remember) buffs we can put on someone else</div></div><hr />

Voice=MT or Self(adds modifer to agro gaining formula..i.e. hits/procs/disc's)adds in a %modifier to agro equation<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cirulik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yes it was Voice (typing brain-fart on Terror, I hardly ever even have it memmed).<br />
<br />
All I can conjecture is that the timing of my cast had something to do with it; I was neaking in a refresh during the pull.  I'll play with it a bit and see it I can figure it out.<br />

Thx for the comments.</div></div><hr />
