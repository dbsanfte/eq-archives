<br />

<br />
Call me crazy, but going by the descriptions, these aren't usable by SK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The way i understand it that on test when you alt list or something of that nature you get a list of alt activate commands or something and they change based on class. So people logged on test and did alt list or whatever with each class and this what popped up when you were on an SK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ghismonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Stonewall, plars.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Keyan Aubaine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The edited list is accurate, a friend of mine made it from test data (and therefore not under the NDA).<br />
<br />
The string not found one is DoT crits (just the description isn't there yet).<br />
<br />
Actually looks like we'll have something to spend AAs on this time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Feriin Cydovu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Damn finally some decent AA's and I won't be buying this expansion for a while. oh well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">aa's are decent seem like PoP2.0 which is what i was hoping for... hopefully experience increase from old expansions will also be akin to PoP's increase from luclin heh :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I like the aa's, especially if both FD's stay on the list.  Hotkeyed DP would essentially free up another spell slot (2 extras in one expansion! yay!), and assuming immitate death is longer recast, it still sounds like a nifty tool to have in our pocket.<br />
<br />
Fury of Magic and Soul Thief = about damn time.<br />
<br />
Stun resistance AA = about damn time<br />
<br />
Shield block AA... fuck yeah.<br />
<br />
Soul Abrasion upgrade and innate chance to lifetap proc-  not bad, the innate proc thing sounds like a nifty idea, actual usefulness will depend on how frequently it fires.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kemora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">This list has great promise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">So does this mean we'll be getting regular suspend minion as well?<br />
<br />
Also, I wonder which other classes get the Reflexive Master and Defensive Instincts AAs.  I would imagine that, at the very least, warriors and paladins are in line for these, but hopefully not rangers, beastlords or berserkers, or any of the priests or intelligence casters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ganaith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Why do i get the feeling that this list is promising too much?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ghismonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Also, I wonder which other classes get the Reflexive Master and Defensive Instincts AAs.

<br />
Me too.  Seems like a perfect opportunity to put a little space between the so-called'tank classes' and the non-tank classes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only hybrids and melee get them so bst and rangers will tank better also but least casters and clerics wont...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Silence</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">BAHAHAHAHA &gt;&lt;   the one time we dont get fucked and im shipping to boot camp 5 days after it goes live... <br />
<br />
unfucking believable enjoy em ! maybe they'll fix our mitigation while im gone too...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kemora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I have serious problems with the FT cap being raise to 40 or whatever. Seems like its going to trivialize the game even more then just 70 is going to.<br />
<br />
I hope sony is happy when every mob in pop is single grouped. PoP mobs with AE Mana dots are going to be jokes, because now you'll just med back faster then the AE takes it. OoW better have some great xp/raid zones, heh.<br />
<br />
They might as well add a &quot;Godmode&quot; AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Omg! This list is alot better than GoD one! :) Definitely POP 2.0 list and epic is RoK. Like I said before in other thread is that OOW is basically POP+ROK 2.0. :)<br />
<br />
Previous expansions.. Endure breath was largely useless cuz everyone can simply buy EB, use spells or EB aug. Now, we can get permanent eb via AA! Then we *NEVER* have to worry about wasting 1 spell slot for it or waste valuable aug slot on EB that could be used with better stuff etc.<br />
<br />
Shield block? About damn time! We lost that shield specialization AA to warriors during test phase before GoD hits. I hope we won't lose it again!<br />
<br />
Trade AAs are nice. It's no surprise that we won't get damn JC mastery or it'll tick off chanters. bah. :) They got it last POP and I'm sure they would be pissed off if they gave it away. <br />
<br />
FT cap increase, stat cap increase, stun resist, lifetap proc power increase, more defensive AA! so go on is excellent. I just hope that Imitiate Death is also useable by SK cuz it said monk in description. I'm looking forward to it. ;)  FB itself is interesting cuz it'll be 65 while you are 70. Level gap narrows. POP time.. Max was 59 when you are 65..  Here it comes.. You can FB tactic mobs, hard LDONs, GoD trials etc etc. ;) Fun toy. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">So far I'm liking this AA list quite a lot.  Getting a spell slot back for Death Peace, plus getting at least one more through AA is real nice.  The possibility of getting the FD+Fade ability is cool, and the shield block is hopefully going to be great.  Stun resistance is nice.  Permanent EB is nice.  I think there is one that gives permanent see invis as well?  That is nice, though having to buy permanent infravision and ultravision to get it sucks if you're a Dark Elf already.  Even with the proliferation of Faerune effects (which will probably be going away with the addition of these AAs) it is still nice.  All melee classes getting the avoidance and mitigation AAs is a little disappointing, but not unexpected.<br />
<br />
Here's hoping they don't backtrack from this list, and instead add more to it.  Or at the least leave it like it is, I'd hate to get a whiff of some of these abilities, only to have them yanked away again.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">All melee classes getting the avoidance and mitigation AAs is a little disappointing, but not unexpected.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hehe, its no big deal really cuz of modifier against base. Warrior has highest base mitigation then multiply this with mitigation % over caster with lowest base mitigation then multiply this with same %. Casters pay SAME AA for lowest mitigation return than warriors would.<br />
<br />
For example, (making up numbers for easy math read).. Warriors have 100 mitigation base x 1.20% mitigation (20%) = 120 new base..<br />
<br />
Casters have 50 mitigation base x 1.20% = 60 new base..<br />
<br />
You see?  Casters only earned 10 extra points into base mitigation while warriors got 20 more for same AA price they paid. Same goes to HP % modifier. Warrior gets more hp per % AA they paid over any other classes all cuz they have highest hp to sta ratio and higher base.<br />
<br />
Let them have it. :) The gap will continue to widen with OOW even with SAME % that we all get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">As far as Warriors also getting shield block, is Warrior aggro so ridiculously high than they can easily hold aggro with a shield and a one hander?  I hadn't thought that was the case, but perhaps it is.  If it is, then Warriors might actually use this AA, but if it isn't, I doubt they'll use it and will complain that it's a wasted AA for their class.<br />
<br />
In regards to the new avoidance and mitigation AAs, I was hoping they would use these to increase the tanking gap between the three plate tanks and everybody else.  With ranger and monk tanking the way it is, I wouldn't be surprised if these abilities put them above us in terms of raw tanking.  That's completely disregarding the Shield Block AA at the moment.<br />
<br />
Also, wasn't there some AA that gave 5000 HP instantly, then had a 680 per tick dot for a minute (maybe 1.1 minutes) afterwards?  Who gets that one?  Is that the warrior one that boosts their HP temporarily but then leaves them weaker after it wears off?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh and what i read was the warrior aa thing the warlord tenicity type aa just does a N number of instant heal and leaves a dot on the warrior doesn't raise their hp.<br />
<br />
And last thing for the FTcap i was hearing that may just be a typo and they mean 1 ft per rank increase which sounds more realistic. I was personally hoping for a ft25 cap but whatever.</div></div><hr />

I have already used it a ton and I am glad I made the purchase.. 8AA isn't bad for a useful ability such as this.<br />
<br />
I missed the significance of this on my first read.<br />
<br />
I'm assuming that the Test server is NOT where the OoW beta testing is taking place (I honestly don't know -- never been on Test nor have participated in any betas); so on that assumption, even though these AA strings for OoW are present, the OoW AA's and level cap increases are not generally available to players on Test.  But on Test, SK's have Suspend Minion?<br />
<br />
That almost indicates we'd get Suspend Minion on live before OoW release (doubt it but plausible -- but there is no precedent for adding new AA's except during expansion releases).  I'll be the first to admit I didn't see the uses and significance of Suspend Minion when it was proposed for GoD but I sure do now (as every other group member suspends their pet and I have to wave goodbye to virtued/f07'd/hasted Jabobner  :( ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Tropics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Going through that list and seeing our new AA's they look good. Then going through our list and comparing it with the warrior list I see us loosing alot more ground in the tanking battle. Already SK's are behing in tanking, we get one really good tanking AA and warriors get it as well. Warriors also get more tanking AA's, more hps, more mitigation.  We get tap procs and inate lifesteal (if I read that right, that better be what it is). Unless those procs are made way better by the new AA's and that inate lifetap does really good return (like 15% at least at the top) we are screwd. It can work for us, but we will need to proc like crazy and hit hard and accurately for the inate lifesteal even at 15-20% to make any difference tanking.<br />
<br />
Being as all of those advances are proc and attack based healing stuff I kind of wish we had some AA's that increased our ability to attack. Triple attack AA, 5 levels of 5 weapon skill per a level AA (for 25 more total to 2HD slash or whatever), some things to go along with that inate lifesteal on all melee attacks because we are not gonna heal alot due to our crap attack ratings and our chronic missing. Sure we can get a proc on a miss, but I want high attack for that inate lifesteal on melee attacks. Level 70 and we are still working with Kunark level weapon skills, yipee.  :(</div></div><hr />

yah he's a moron because he's not ready to ballwash soe over a list of AA's that when you really think about it haven't addressed our complaints one iota.<br />
<br />
the defensive &quot;upgrades&quot; you are raving about are going to all melee / hybrid classes. so explain to me how this improves our tanking relative to warriors, or increases the tanking gap between knights and non-plate classes? yes i'll spend AA on these , but will they address the concerns that so many on this board have voiced recently?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Every single one of these AAs is a direct power increase. Every single one of them is better than our GoD AAs. Moron.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Calling me nancy and kicking me in the teeth would be better than our GoD AAs. Double riposte is a &quot;power increase&quot; too. once again shield block can be used by warriors as well, so...... no change relative to warriors. ok this will further separate us from rng / bst as tanks but at the cost of going to 1h weapons. personally i think it's ridiculous that i should also have to use a shield to have significantly better tanking ability than a non-plate class. oh non to mention , no riposte disc type AA , so for offtanking situations , we're still bottom rung on the ladder behind , beastlords, rangers and , comically, bards.<br />
<br />
As for innate proc upgrades, you and i both know they'd have to get exponentially better than they currently are to make any difference in our tanking ability or to seriously affect dps. i'm not even in the elemental planes and the relative dps added by them vs. melee dps is not terribly significant. i can only imagine what a drop in the bucket these are for sk's in time or beyond. they represent what? 1% of their dps. as a percentage of incoming damage the proportion is undoubtedly worse. unless the proc rate or amount healed is dramatically increased, this does not change a whole lot, &quot;power increase&quot; or not.<br />
<br />
personally the AA's that to me look the most interesting are the extra spell slot , imitate death, the alternate death peace and touch of the cursed. that said , everyone is getting an extra spell slot and imitate death has monk in its description, hopefully we keep it. the idea of 2 extra spell slots is exciting and touch of the cursed sounds like it could be great but i don't see that these AA are soom huge boon to sk's. you can put me in your &quot;moron&quot; category as well.</div></div><hr />

SCF is one of our best AA's currently - it affects a wide range of our abilities and is a notable 7% improvement... there's a reason a large segment of the SK population has been bitching about not having Fury of Magic since PoP's release.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Bumraz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">SCF is good for two reasons: <br />

I think you just covered some shit in your statistics summer school class and just wanted to drop some KNAWLEDGE on the peeps. So do me a favor and explain to me the difference between having 5% of my attacks do double damage and 5% of the attacks on me miss. Explain why one is better than the other. <br />
<br />

Just limit your discussion to  Calculating Expected Value of Random Trials (http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=Calculating+Expected+Value+of+Random+Trials)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Eatpeople</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">Poisson <br />
<br />
The Poisson distribution arises from one of those beautiful results that make mathematics so fascinating. The general rule covering the probability of getting a certain result in a number of trials of a random even is the binomial distribution.<br />
<br />
This distribution arises from a theorem of Bernoulli, which states that:<br />
<br />
If the probability of success in each trial is p, and hence the probability of failure is 1-p then the probability of r successes in n trials is<br />
<br />
 .<br />
<br />
This all looks a bit daunting to those unfamiliar with the mathematical notation of combinations, but it is really all quite simple and you can derive it for yourself from first principles by thinking about problems such as successive tossings of coins. You can generate the numbers by a simple device know as Pascals triangle.<br />
<br />
The Poisson distribution is a special case of the binomial, for the condition that p is small and therefore q approaches unity. It is important because most of the cases for which statistical support is needed are necessarily concerned with small probabilities, i.e. relatively rare events. To cut a long story short, if the mean value is m then the probability of 0,1, 2, 3, successes is given by:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Again, this looks daunting to those unfamiliar with the notation, but the important thing to notice (and the beautiful result) is that the distribution has only one parameter, m. And, in fact, the variance (square of the standard deviation) is also m. Thus for any given value of m there is a unique sequence of numbers corresponding to the probability of getting 0, 1, 2, 3,.. in random trials.<br />
<br />
Often, in areas such as epidemiology, we know the value we expect for the mean from observations of the general population or a control group, so we know the rough sort of deviation we would expect from the mean, which is the square root of the mean itself.<br />
<br />
Here is what the numbers look like for expected values of 1, 2, 5 and 10. We can see that, as the expected valued increases, the shape rapidly tends towards the familiar bell of the normal distribution. We also note that the most likely value (mode) is close to the expected value and that the spread is in the region of the square root of this number.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
To take a simplified numerical example: if we know from observations of the general population that the annual probability of catching a certain disease is 0.001 and we have a sample of 10,000 people who have been exposed to a putative cause, then we would expect at random 10 of our sample to get the disease. If 14 actually got it, we would not be surprised, since the standard deviation from the mean would be root ten or just over three. On the other hand, if 20 got the disease, this is about three standard deviations away from the mean and therefore more likely to be significantly different from a random result. This is all clearly shown by fourth graph. Thus we have a useful rule of thumb for judging claims without having to resort to probability calculations.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm assuming that the Test server is NOT where the OoW beta testing is taking place (I honestly don't know -- never been on Test nor have participated in any betas); so on that assumption, even though these AA strings for OoW are present, the OoW AA's and level cap increases are not generally available to players on Test.  But on Test, SK's have Suspend Minion?<br />
<br />
That almost indicates we'd get Suspend Minion on live before OoW release (doubt it but plausible -- but there is no precedent for adding new AA's except during expansion releases).  I'll be the first to admit I didn't see the uses and significance of Suspend Minion when it was proposed for GoD but I sure do now (as every other group member suspends their pet and I have to wave goodbye to virtued/f07'd/hasted Jabobner  :( ).<br />
<br />
You would be correct that the Test server is not currently involved in Beta testing. OOW testing is being held on a completely seperate server from Test (thank god).<br />
<br />
Suspend Minion was stealth added to our PoP AA actually and I was as surpised as anyone to see it there. I bought it immediately when I could. All indications would be that it will go live (I dont see why it wont go live with the next patch) and will be simply an addition to our current AA abilities instead of combined with the Omens AA's.<br />

Partially true...<br />
<br />
Next patch won't be happening until OoW - so SK's won't be able to purchase Suspend Minion until OoW launch day (although it looks like you won't require the Xpac to use them).... Zerkers are in a similar boat for their non-OoW AA currently.<br />
<br />
And assuming the person in question would purchase OoW - Suspend Minion level 3 (which I presume SK's are getting as well) is supposed to allow you to zone with a suspended pet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We'll see how it evolves, but at this point it's definitely worthwhile and by no means sub-par.<br />
It is interesting to note the absence of HP AAs for any class, and the (at last) halt put to pushing HT forward.<br />
<br />
In fine, there is no reason to whine (although feedback to tweak them some is certainly important) that they won't fix class balance, as AAs are a mean to differentiate a player who invests time and effort into improving his character versus the players who won't bother. Class balance has to come from more core game mechanics which do not vary, unlike which AAs are bought and in what order. They certainly fit the bill in their current form, and have the potential to be perfect with little tweaking.</div></div><hr />

yay for shield block, but it does not address the warrior/knight balance if warriors take the AAs to increase their tanking at the cost of their dps (which i believe most warriors would do in a second if their tanking started to show signs of falling behind the content).<br />
<br />
NONE of the SK Specific skills scales.  Sony has not evidenced an iota of thought on the issue of scaling SK skills as this forum has been talking about for years.  The gap between pallies and SKs will inevitably grow larger as their class defining skills scale while our taps stagnate.  If sony makes SK taps powerful to balance us at the end of the expansion, we would be unbalanced at the beginning (and vice versa).<br />
<br />
If these insipid AAs are the example of the parochial thought that characterizes OOW, then I wonder if we can expect spell lines like Fear2 or a Calliav-style spell in OOW to address the pally/SK gap.  I sure hope we do, but don't celebrate these AAs when our top 10 list remains ignored.<br />
<br />
Scaleability... and equality between knight classes... without these we will remain disfavored amongst our peers.  keep your eyes on the prize!</div></div><hr />

What I am wondering about when I see &quot;Improved suspend minion&quot; added to our list, when we don't even have the original, is:<br />
<br />
Who do they have watching over the shadowknight class?  Is anyone? <br />
<br />
It looks (and I could be wrong) like they went through and figured out a bunch of AAs for OoW, gave us Improved version, and then someone went &quot;fuck wait, we didn't give them suspend minion in the first place, lets add it in fast&quot;, thus its on test.<br />
<br />
That level of attention to character abilities doesn't give me a whole lot of hope for balancing.  They don't even seem to know who has what AA.  At least as far as SKs are concerned.  If you don't know what your character classes can do, how can you balance them correctly?<br />

Darkblade of the Warlord + Anger 3 + Symbol of the Planemasters<br />
<br />
Darkblade is a 38/35.<br />
38 damage rating plus 13 DB = 51 hate per swing<br />
Warriors swing an average of 1.71 times per round.<br />
Max hasted (but without bard overhaste)  means 34.3 rounds per minute<br />
34.3 rounds per minute is 58.6 swings on average.<br />
58.6 swings at 51 hate, times 1.15 for Echo of Anger is 3437 aggro per minute in melee.<br />
Anger proc is somewhere in the vicinity of 1200 hate, 550 of which can be boosted via multipliers, which makes it 1282 after Echo of Anger.<br />
Darkblade has a 30 percent procrate mod, for 2.6ppm base, or 3.9ppm with WA5.  Comes out to almost exactly 5k aggro per minute without any Combat Effects.<br />
Anger 3 will proc approx 2.8 times per minute with WA5, for another 1680.<br />
Pestilence Shock is ~475 hate per proc.  WA5 will not affect it, but will interfere a bit, leaving that around 1.8ppm, but boosted by Echo of Anger, for anoter 983 hate.<br />
Ancient Chaos Cry is 1800 hate per minute if they spam it as it refreshes (Lucy)... we're around 12.4k hate per minute here, with no offhander and zero Combat Effects.<br />
<br />
Some of these numbers I pulled out of my ass.  Some are estimates.  Some are not.  We're sitting around 12.8k hate per minute for a warrior that has zero Combat Effects, no Ferocity enhancements, and no spammable clickies for disposable aggro (like snare glands).<br />
<br />
Let's assume Demerix as an offhander.<br />
<br />
32 damage.  No damage bonus.  (Sinister Strikes would give it a DB of 7, but it is not known at this time if it adds hate properly)  1.65 attacks per round, as Flurry doesn't kick in for offhanders, DW kicking in 60 percent of the time.  22.8 attacks per minute, for 730 hate per minute in melee (840 with EoA).  Serpents Bite is laughable aggro, assume 1:1 ratio for the DD part and 1:4 ratio for the 'heal' component, putting it at 125 hate per proc (144 with EoA), and 1.8ppm from offhand direct weapon proc.  We're up to 260 aggro from that.  Anger 3 will go around twice, for another 1300 aggro.  Pestilence Shock should go off ~1.5 times for 820 aggro with EoA.<br />
<br />
So, if the DB from Sinister Strikes doesn't add aggro like a normal DB, then we're looking at around 3200 aggro from offhand, roughly a third of the mainhand aggro.  If it DOES kick in, however, then we're looking at another 184 hate from that or so.  Gasp!  And the biggest portion of the hate from the offhander comes from the Anger augment, with the clicky proc and melee dps coming in neck and neck for second place.<br />
<br />
Are these estimates valid?  Probably not at all!  I'm too bloody tired to open up the windows necessary to find the parses (mostly Brael's) that gave numbers.  I round alot.  Should have been an engineer.<br />
<br />
Losing a quarter of their aggro would hurt, yes... but these estimates were without bard overhaste, Combat Effects, or Ferocity, all of which would raise the numbers significantly.  I'm going to bed, now.  I even forget what conclusion I was trying to make.</div></div><hr />

considering you get hit a shitload more than you hit for, the later is 10000000x better (take that number up your math and smoke it).  unless you spend all your time fighting greens who dont hit you at all and you get to watch all the pretty crit numbers on your screen<br />
<br />
plus there's the small issue of being a fucking tank not a wizard.  and 5 percent damage mitigation is 100000000000x more utility for doing your fucking job<br />
<br />
a couple of notes about aa.  looks like hotkey FD for sk and necros are one usefull thing and one that we've been asking for.  thumbs up on that.  there's other shit like suspend and control minion that's basically a change in design for pets in the game that everyone gets but instead of just being changed costs players AA to get<br />
<br />
not all of these aa will be on the final list, obviously since sony's MO has been to jack up a bunch of aas then pare them down for release<br />
<br />
also MUDflation on AAs for shit like damage avoidance, mitigation, FT etc across all classes does jack shit for SKs unless you're buying GoD to farm older content.  if everyone gets these aas (even shield block) sony will simply tune content with the assumption that end game players will have this level of mitigation, damage, regen and FT.  and in the end all you're doing is running a 200aa treadmill and ending up in the same place<br />
<br />
most of this shit really only represents gains versus old content.  in a way for bottom feeding players and guilds... like those who cant break out of EP or whatever and need the cushion that 5 levels and an additional % of hand holding via more mitigation etc for 2 year old content it's a boon.  for end gamers MUDflation AAs really yield zero.  except the grind for the few weeks it takes for you to lock down the next level of LR or eye-candy crits</div></div><hr />

I wouldn't mind either, but unlike Spell Casting Expertise / Mastery of the Past (of which you made a good point, I didn't know that about RNG/BST), something tells me if we did get the third level without the first two, we would probably find our pets had no buffs after being unsuspended.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>Tukka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">Temuchin, you make a good point.  All higher end OoW content is likely going to be balanced under the assumption that all the tanks have all the tanking and supplementary tanking AAs.  This stuff helps &quot;bottom feeders&quot; probably more than anyone else, but I am a &quot;bottom feeder&quot; (as is most of my server), so this is pretty good stuff for us.  But seriously, how many people play nothing but content added in the latest expansion (and revamps since the last expansion?)  We get upgrades to pretty much every important ability we possess that can be improved upon, that is about all you can really expect.<br />
<br />
Is it a treadmill for the end gamers?  Of course it is, what MMO isn't a treadmill?  If you're in a cutting edge raiding guild, then as much as you may appreciate or hate the AAs added in the expansion, is it really that big a deal?  The actual design of the encounters is what I would think matters most.  Are they appropriately challenging, innovative and fun?  If so, what does it matter if you now have 5 or 20 &quot;mandatory&quot; AAs you have to get to be on par for what the content is balanced for?  You have to want to do something with your exp.<br />
<br />
With a FD hotkey (maybe two--or maybe Imitate Death is something that just modifies all of your existing FD abilities), and an additional mem slot, I have a feeling that gaining those two mem slots is going to feel like gaining a hundred.  I think that's easily what I'm most excited about.<br />
<br />
I also wonder that if the fact that we are now getting Suspend Minion, and the fact that we got other pet enhancing abilities in the last expansion means that they are putting some thought into making SK pets more valuable.  I won't hold my breath there, likely they are just throwing us a bone by giving us what all the other pet classes have, but it would be nice if they were putting some actual thought into giving us a cool pet... the fact that this will be the first pet we get that isn't a lower level necromancer pet is another possible promising sign.<br />
<br />
Overall, I think this is a pretty solid list.  Is it a substitution for game balance?  No.  Am I going to start writing love letters to Sony?  Hell no.  But it's still good stuff.  It gives all knights something to look forward, regardless of their level of progression, which is something GoD AA really did not do at all.  That's pretty cool, in my opinion.</div></div><hr />

Not everyone spends their entire online life bottom-feeding.  If you raid, the mobs will hit harder than you will, unless your guild is a joke and &quot;raiding&quot; things that its members could probably kill with a two-boxer.<br />
<br />
The AA's are good.  Pulling non-tank melee ahead of the casters in tanking is a bit unnecessary, and I still feel that the upgraded CS/CA should be tanks only.  I dont care about the Ranger vs Wizard mitigation issues.  I gave up on Warrior vs Knight mitigation.  However, Knight vs Ranger/Monk mitigation I want to see with a nice, healthy gap.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just a question to people like you....<br />
<br />
Was PoP a good AA line up?<br />
<br />
If you do agree that PoP was (which I personally think it was for most classes) - please compare and contrast the amount of PoP AA that was logical upgrades to lines and the current OoW lists.<br />
<br />
For most classes its 80% logical upgrades, 20% innovative/new stuff approx - about the same ballpark as PoP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u90"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p90">vaclav, i already stated they're good AAs, but the only &quot;innovative&quot; AA we're the only ones getting is really the innate chance leech curse.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u91"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p91">I'm just glad they look likely to put in the AA that we wanted most when we saw the &quot;preliminary&quot; GoD list last winter...<br />

If it's innovative, it's liable to be fucked up, broken, or less than useful.  If it's an upgrade to something we already know and like, you basically can't go wrong.  I'll take &quot;more of the same&quot; tried and true good ones than something &quot;innovative&quot; without thinking twice...  <br />
<br />
Everyone liked our PoP AA's - why would you not want more of the same?  Except, wait, it's not just more of the same, it's also got the stuff we didn't get with PoP (DP on a button), despite pleading for it incessantly.  <br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
And to all the people bitching about class balance - seriously, just STFU and take it to a thread about class balance.  These AA's are not the answer to class balance and thats the way it should be.  When a class imbalance is fixed by AA's, the AA's lose that first &quot;A&quot;... Yeah, we need class balance addressed; we need it addressed by the people in charge of class balance and as a change accross the board, not by the AA people as a change you have to purchase.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What warrior AA help make the tanking gap bigger?<br />
<br />
Shield Block? Mitigation? Avoidance? -510 HP before you die? - Both classes get all of these.<br />
<br />
STA cap raise AA - due to a better HP table, they'll get a slight edge here, but mostly marginal.<br />
<br />
No Ripostes for offhand AA - most warriors already switch to a shield in cases when ripostes cause large spikes, will only really allow them to be more lazy/more DPS.<br />
<br />
Resolute Defiance - I've never seen a warrior purchase it, much less use it, can't imagine it has that large of a swing.<br />
<br />
Most of their unique AA could be compared to SK Lifetap AA in how large of an effect its going to have - and at least Lifetap AA always have constant chances to go off. (and yes, they don't address one rounding - hopefully that is addressed when the discs are added - they do reduce the healing burden on us however)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u97"><b>Blackstone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p97">IMHO the AA list is pretty good.  <br />
<br />
A new wave of LR/ID/ND is a good thing.  I don't care if casters get it as well.  If they really wanted to make things fair they'd do the following:<br />
<br />
Everyone able to get ND extention<br />
Chain and Plate able to get LR extension<br />
Plate able to get ID extention.<br />
<br />
But, as I said its not a bad thing.<br />
<br />
Fury of Magic:  Another good thing.<br />
Soul Theif:  An even better thing.  It would even be better still if we could get a Lifetap equivalent of the Gift of Marr thing (i.e. the skill that adds 3% to all heals).<br />
<br />
Improved Soul Abrasion:  A very good thing.  Soul Abrasion 3 is defintely one of our best AAs ever.  This will be very high on my list.<br />
<br />
Touch of the Cursed:  Now, the innate lifetap chance.  Honestly, I can't figure that out either with the 45 second recast time.  I don't know whether that's a mistake or what.  If it indeed has a 45 second recast, then its really quite a pointless skill.  You'd be far better off investing in Fury of Magic.  If that's just a mistake and there's a 5% chance of this firing, then this would be a really nice skill.  Bottom line, this could go either way, someone is just going to have to buy it and see what's what.<br />
<br />
Sheild Block:  Definitely a good thing.  Whether its knight only or War included matters very little.  This will help close the gap with warriors and help increase the gap between Monk/Ranger.  Why? Firstly, Monk/Ranger obviously don't have access to this.  Second, while warriors can wear shields, they are definitely more situational for Warriors than for Knights.  If Warriors wear shields to tank Raid Mobs (or even more frequently to rampage tank raid mobs) -- I don't care.  They are supposed to tank raid mobs, more power to them.  <br />
<br />
Warriors very very infrequently wear shields in groups and groups are where we are hurting.  Honestly, I am using my shield of strife more than I ever thought that I would when I asked for it.  <br />
<br />
All the pet stuff:  To make our pets even remotely useful to us at high lvls of play, we must have access to suspend minion.  If they truly are giving us this, then we can be sure that our final pet is going to be an improvement.  Its currently coded as sk_pet_68_ and not as previous pets were skeleton_41 (for example).  What this means I don't know.<br />
<br />
Imitate Death:  I refuse to believe that they are going to actually give this or any useful FD upgrades to us.  They've dangled this infront of us several times in beta's and monk whining has always prevented it.  I won't hold my breath.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u98"><b>Vaclav</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p98">Well I am pissed we dont have Tactical Mastery and Fury of Magic Mastery on that list.<br />
<br />
Tactical Mastery? That's a DPS thing mostly, heard rumors that since the revamp ST'ed ripostes don't hit back in retaliation, but not gotten any confirmation from ST'ed up tank.<br />
<br />
As for FoMM - we are getting some sort of Fury of Magic upgrade....<br />

<br />
So we can get a 125 point heal (looks like it can be Crit and/or Thefted) Once every 45 seconds with melee attacks.<br />
<br />
The recast time means nothing vs. its proc rate - I can show you plenty of effects in Lucy where proc rate excedes the listed RC time by a sizable margin.<br />
<br />
The question is will it fuck our weapon and or innate buff proc chances? If so great another fucked up AA for SKs. <br />
<br />
#1 - They're currently coded on test to allow Weapon procs and Innate procs to happen on the same swing (the issue that weapon procs esp. with WA5 was causing us)<br />
<br />
#2 - With the description and the lack of a &quot;buff&quot; effect, I think it will just work like an invisible aug added to whatever weapon you're wielding - probably first in proc priority, since SoE knows most of us would love to have a LT proc as our most common one.</div></div><hr />

Warriors don't mix and overlap/lose effectiveness on their abilities. Every offensive power they have, coupled with defensive, and hotkey clicks are all working together.<br />
<br />
We on the other hand as knights overlap one to the next to do what we need to do. All of these spells, these spell casting upgrades, these melee upgrades. What is the point if it doesn't address a very specific issue within time frames of the game?<br />
<br />
I personally don't care if SoE rattles off 20 more high powered dots and gives them to us because it'll just mean 20 more spells I can't get off on a single mob when its zerg time on yard trash in a raid. <br />
<br />

The shield block aa will narrow the gap between knights and warriors even if they get it to.  Why? Because while we lose some dps our total hate generation changes very little.  If a warrior uses a shield in a group he loses his dps and much of his hate generation, so his whole group loses much of it's dps.<br />
<br />
The current problems with class balance can only be solved with new discs for knights or some innate ability that everyone gets.<br />
Top 3 on my list:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u113"><b>Noctix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p113">There has been a ton of talk about knights getting some sort of avoidance disc.  However, the warrior opinion seems to be that the tanking gap is fine the way it is (or at least that the paly/warrior gap is fine and that maybe SKs need something to compete with paly stuns).  In an effort to compromise and make everyone happy, I have an idea:<br />
<br />
How would you feel about a new avoidance disc for all three tank classes? Something like 18 seconds of auto-parry with a 30 minute reuse (numbers are debateable). However, it would be on a seperate timer from other warrior discs so warriors could add it to their normal disc rotation, increasing their overall tanking power. This would come closer to maintaining the current tanking gap than if knights receive a new disc and warriors get nothing.  Everyone gets a new tanking tool that will eliminate some of the problem knights are facing against current content (especially boss mobs in single group content) and give warriors more flexibility in long crawls and better survival in a long fight.<br />
<br />
I see this as having a lot of potential, especially since they haven't released any info on new discs for OOW yet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't you think warriors having yet another unlocked mitigation/avoidance disc would be over-powering considering the tools warriors already have?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u115"><b>DConquest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p115">Speaking of Discs, something I'd really like to see is Leechcurse changed to 3 min duration and 10 min reuse or something close, and a lvl 70 disc that gives us back 4 times our dmg for 30 secs.  I mean, we're not going to win the tanking class balance battle on Mitigation or Avoidance fronts lets face it... but if we can get something that allows to regen quickly enough to allow us to tank efficiently then that would receive much less opposition from other classes.  <br />
<br />
Think about Shroud of Death when the SA aa 1st came out, how effective Fungi tunics are at low lvls, or if you ever played City of Heroes how the Regen Scrapper class plays out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u116"><b>Jespar Bloodreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p116">The only way to figure out if there is a problem is not to listen to either warriors or shadowknights. Then from there look at things from a bird's eye perspective.<br />
<br />
In any instance of Pre-EP and EP(Earth, Air, Water, Fire) it is VIABLE and often seen that a Paladin or Shadowknight is used as tank. This was the balance of Planes of Power and it was a very viable balance that SHD and PAL could step in place of WAR and still be viable. <br />
<br />
Once you go into GoD however is when disparities start to show up. Honestly anything Tipt+ Hits extremely hard. Warriors imo are the ONLY class than can efficiently tank those areas. This is a MAJOR problem in terms of efficiancy and fun factor.<br />
<br />
Why is this a problem? Well, lets observe some other cockblock class factors that have existed in the past with EQ and have been solved.<br />
<br />
Clerics and healing: In the past with Clerics there was a major cockblock in terms of having a viable healer in the group. Druids and Shamans and Paladins and others who were/are healing classes were FAR behind a Cleric in terms of healing. Sony eventually came to their senses and upped the healing power of these classes. Now there is VIABILTY that a Druid can take a Cleric's place, and a Shaman can act as a secondary healer. It is no longer absolutely neccesary to have a cleric as main healer. Res can also be overlooked in the case of having a Pal/Nec in the group.<br />
<br />
Mana regen: This also used to be a major cockblock along with CC in terms of absolutely needing an Enchanter for areas around Norrath. Today we have SHD mana giving, Necro's twitching as usual and Beastlords offering Paragon and what not. These days you can VIABLY go without an ENC for mana regen and use root/snare combinations to CC.  Lets not forget Bard mez either. Plenty of viabilty here in what used to be a big problem.<br />
<br />
Pulling: In the past when you absolutely needed a split class you had SHD and MNK. If neither of those two were avalible then you had no choice but find good CC or no go. Today you have three FD classes and very good choices about who can pull. Finding a puller for a Tipt++ group is no problem at all. VIABILITY again in Sony offering alternatives.<br />
<br />
Since GoD has been released the disparity in terms of viable tanks has become disgusting. The only way to go about doing anything successfully beyond Tipt is to have a Warrior tanking. This is both a cockblock for knight classes and a cockblock for people who do not have the ear and interest of an 11khp tank with tank disciplines. It causes two problems.<br />
<br />
1) Knights don't get groups for these instances, period.<br />
<br />
2) Groups who CANNOT get an 11khp tank or even a 8-9k hp tank that has tank disciplines will also find themselves crippled to where these instances will be out of reach.<br />
<br />
We are at another stage where EQ was pre-PoP with healing issues. This is again the same place we were with the traditional EQ in that Shamans and Druids had greater healing compared to Clerics complete heal and superior heal. Groups need Warriors in said groups, or it is a no go.<br />
<br />
All we should be asking for is for our viability in the role of a tank is fixed. I don't care what they do. The only way for them to fix our tanking viabilities in GoD is to give us more mitigation in some way shape or form. But lets look at what Sony's answer is thus far to this problem. <br />
<br />
EVERYTHING we have right now is based on chance. Chance is not a good thing when you are tanking such areas. I cannot be a viable tank if my main line of defense is depending on whether or not I pull off a crit/exceptional on one of my lifetaps. I cannot go with that to say I'll be good as a tank. One bad streak of luck and the healer is OOM or I'm dead. <br />
<br />
Whatever the case is if you look from a bird's eye view post-OOW and see that both groups and knights are cockblocked by tank issues then the problem hasn't been fixed, only dragged on.</div></div><hr />

Honestly, I'm not sure.<br />
<br />
On one hand, it would make them far more powerful against boss mobs.  But that's kind of their specialty, right?  As long as raid bosses were tuned towards this disc being in the rotation, I see no problem there.<br />
<br />
As for how it would effect them in normal exp groups, a long reuse timer would mean that it wouldn't have much effect on their long term mitigation.<br />
<br />
Still, if you have specific examples of why it would be overpowering, please bring them up, I have no problem being told that my ideas are stupid  :D <br />
<br />
Plus this would solve some of our woes, but it still doesn't address how we can compete with pally stuns.<br />

<br />
Not calling ideas stupid at all, I just don't agree with your suggestion. Quick google search of warrior disciplines....<br />
<br />
Evasive - This Discipline lets you get hit less but makes you hit target less as well. It last for 3 minutes.The Reuse time is 15 minutes. <br />
<br />
Defensive - This Discipline lets you take less damage. The otherside is that you deal less damage aas well. It lasts for 3 minutes and, has a base reuse time of 15 minutes.  <br />
<br />
Furious - When using this discipline, the warrior will automatically riposte every attack landed on him by the opponent he is facing. This discipline lasts for 9 seconds, and has a base reuse time of 60 minutes. <br />
<br />
Fortitude - When using this discipline, the warrior cannot be hit in melee combat. This discipline lasts for 8 seconds, and has a base reuse time of 60 minutes. The reuse time for this discipline will decrease as the warrior gains additional levels.<br />

I just think another 18 second immunity disc would make them even more powerful. Hell they already have a shitload of tools at their disposal now. If we both get the same thing, it's not balance; it's more or less a wash. Still leaving the knights unbalanced against the warriors.</div></div><hr />

Evasive - This Discipline lets you get hit less but makes you hit target less as well. It last for 3 minutes.The Reuse time is 15 minutes. <br />
<br />
Defensive - This Discipline lets you take less damage. The otherside is that you deal less damage aas well. It lasts for 3 minutes and, has a base reuse time of 15 minutes.  <br />
<br />
Furious - When using this discipline, the warrior will automatically riposte every attack landed on him by the opponent he is facing. This discipline lasts for 9 seconds, and has a base reuse time of 60 minutes. <br />

You missed Stonewall, the level 65 warrior disc.  However, you also didn't mention the warrior disc timers:<br />
Timer 1: Defensive, Evasive, Stonewall<br />
Timer 2: Fortitude, Furious<br />
<br />
So really, while they have flexibility in what discs they use, they currently can only use 2 discs during any given &quot;rotation&quot;.  Then they have to wait for the reuse timers to cycle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u120"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p120">How would you feel about a new avoidance disc for all three tank classes? Something like 18 seconds of auto-parry with a 30 minute reuse (numbers are debateable). However, it would be on a seperate timer from other warrior discs so warriors could add it to their normal disc rotation, increasing their overall tanking power. This would come closer to maintaining the current tanking gap than if knights receive a new disc and warriors get nothing.  Everyone gets a new tanking tool that will eliminate some of the problem knights are facing against current content (especially boss mobs in single group content) and give warriors more flexibility in long crawls and better survival in a long fight.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hmmm... I like that.  It gives knights what (IMO) we need the most, the ability to withstand those first critical seconds while slow lands, debuffs occur, etc. to keep us from being one-rounded at the beginning of the fight -- YET since warriors would also get it, no balance issue since it benefits them just as much.  The more I think of it, the more I like it and can't see many downfalls or issues.</div></div><hr />

DOH, you're right about me missing Stonewall. I posted that real fast (I'm at work). <br />
<br />
Anyway you slice it, IMO they don't need another 18 seconds. I understand how the disc &quot;rotation&quot; works, what you're proposing (at least this is how I read it) that have a 3rd timer (my main reason for disagreeing with you) for yet another disc. Maybe add another 9 seconds to furious, or 10 seconds to fortitude, I'd agree to keep warriors from bitching. Having a 3rd timer for another disc is not balance .</div></div><hr />

I guess this is an issue of whether the current knight/warrior gap is appropriate or not.<br />
<br />
In my view, we are unbalanced because of two things:<br />
<br />
A) There is a gap between SKs and Paladins because Paladin stuns are far more useful for mitigation than fear or lifetaps.  This is a seperate issue.<br />
<br />
B) Neither SKs or Paladins have any tools for dealing with burst damage on boss fights.  This makes warriors required for many single group encounters, given a similar level of gear.  I have no problem with allowing warriors to be better in this area, I would just like some kind of tool to help me deal with this.  I think bumping up all three classes, knights to having a single timer and warriors to having 3 timers, is a reasonable solution here.  Going from 0 discs to 1 disc is a far bigger upgrade than going from 2 to 3 anyway.<br />
<br />
Now, there is debateably a third balance issue of whether the warrior innate mitigation and hp advantage is fair but that's really a seperate issue as well.</div></div><hr />

furious and fortitude serve one very important purpose on raids and at one point its equivalent to DA and one they arnt close.  When starting a battle you need to slow damage for rot/clerics to move within cheal range.  This is the case in many ikkinz fights + time.  There are 2 ways to do this, one of which is either furious/fortitude, or target da/bard da and hope you click off before people get on the aggro list.  Sks have an identical ability here because they have self da, which although identical to bard/target is still nice to not have to worry about someone casting.<br />
<br />
The second main purpose is tank switches.  MT 1 goes down, MT 2 area taunts and hits furious building aggro without taking huge amounts of damage ( flurry rampage spell dd will still hit ).  This gives the rotation time to get on the appropriate tank.  This is one thing that neither paladin or sks can do in current state, and is very very important on raids.</div></div><hr />
