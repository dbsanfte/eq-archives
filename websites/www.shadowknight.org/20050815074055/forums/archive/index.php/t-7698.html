<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Garila</div><div class="date">10-30-2002, 11:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello, I am a monk.<br />
I do the second most damage of any melee class.<br />
                      But I want more.<br />
I was pissed because verant made my epic and weapons obsolete at level 65 by giving me 18 dmg 20 dly bare fists.<br />
                       I wanted my epic changed.<br />
Now I am pissed because verant took away the 18 dmg 20 dly bare fists that I was bitching about yesterday.<br />
                       I DEMAND my damage mitigation un-nerfed<br />
I wear leather armor and I can tank better than all non-plate wearing classes.<br />
                       I want 60 AC arms to match my pants.<br />
I am nerfed now because I can't easilly solo non-stop.<br />
                       It's only fair since rogues do more damage and warriors have more hitpoints that I am the only pure melee class that can solo efficiently.<br />
<br />
&quot;I swear monks are Verants least favorite class, they are trying to just phase us out.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jobrill</div><div class="date">10-31-2002, 01:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, Fuck the other class, I DESERVE to be able to Tank better than a Warrior and do More damage than a Rogue, except that I shouldn't have to try to position myself on the mobs back. Just upgrade flying kick to Backstab damage and like, call it Kidney stab or Vulcan death grip or sumpin.<br />
<br />
Also, you know, like, Kung-fu Masters really never die, cause thier like too cool and powerful, so I think when Monks hit 0 hp they shouldn't die because they've turned themselves into an immortal fighting machine. They should just, like, move real slow until they can be healed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kebsis</div><div class="date">10-31-2002, 01:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ive been grouping in the Dreadlands a lot recently, and every time I'm there I always (always!) hear the same conversation in /ooc...<br />
<br />
Monk shouts, 'Goddamit I h8te this fucking nerF!!!!1&quot;<br />
<br />
Someone shouts, 'lol monks weren't supposed to be tanks.'<br />
<br />
Monk shouts, 'I couldn't tank before the nerf!'<br />
<br />
Someone shouts, 'Then what are you complaining about??'<br />
<br />
<br />
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I was under the impression that monks soloed toe to toe with mobs right (and I'm really not positive about that so if I'm wrong tell me)?  And if this is true, then how come I keep hearing non uber monks complaining about not being able to solo anymore, if they couldn't to begin with since they couldn't tank?<br />
<br />
And if they didnt go toe to toe with the mob, if they used some kind of kiting technique or something, then doesn't that mean that their tanking ability wasn't integral to soloing in the first place?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Keyan, I think you're getting soft and should change your sig from Pinhead to the guy before he became a Cenobite in the movie. You used to be a fine asshole when you had your heart in it but now seem to be easing into the role of merely disdainful elder statesman. Continue at this rate for a few more months and you'll be positively mild. Get ahold of yourself man.</div></div><hr />

Hell, we've been getting the steel bat so often, a simple nerf is nothing.  You're more likely to whine if you aren't used to getting shafted.<br />
<br />
Shadow Knights just quietly hand the lube to verant and assume the position.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1.    Monks are mammals (sometimes).<br />
<br />
2.    Monks fight ALL the time.<br />
<br />
3.    The purpose of the Monk is to flip out and kill people.<br />

<br />
I have had many  of my main abilities that I have relied on for 3 years changed drastically all in 3 weeks without anyone giving acknowledgement to it after they changed it.<br />
<br />
I spend my whole lifetime training my body to be my weapon and my armor, for I am not supposed to own anything. Too bad a druid takes hits better than I do. Oh well.<br />
<br />
Yeah yeah, I know that plate still should be better, but I should not be getting hit harder on average with my monk than my druid friend.<br />
<br />
I am a monk. I am still waiting for my level 65 discipline, /di realultimatepower.<br />
<br />
You think monks are good at whining? You obviously haven't seen what Shadowknights are capable of!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kebsis</div><div class="date">11-04-2002, 03:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Monks think they're ninjas, but they're not.  Ninjas don't go around bitching and moaning all the time, they are quiet and catlike (unless flipping out).  If a monk ever challenged a ninja to a fight the ninja would just be like, 'yeah right' and disembowel (totally kill) the monk.  Then the ninja would pull out an awesome red guitar and wail away into the night.<br />
<br />
Shit I'm sorry, but I love that website.<br />
<br />
And I never found out how nerfing a monks tanking ability crippled their soloing ability if they never could tank to begin with!</div></div><hr />

<br />
ha.</div></div><hr />
