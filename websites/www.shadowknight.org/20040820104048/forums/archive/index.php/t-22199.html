<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ogrukk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As a Cazic worshiping Ogre, what kind of faction work am I looking at in order to do the loyalist shield of honor quest?  How high do I need katta faction, and what would you suggest as the best way to farm it.  Also, do illusions help at all with this?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

These two posts explain it the best.  Neither are in the Dirty Deeds forum so that'd explain why you probably couldn't find much info on it.<br />
<br />
In a nutshell, don't bother trying to faction for this quest.  Factioning up will help with various stages of the quest and some fights that take place in Katta, but will NOT help you for the final turn in.<br />
<br />
So to save time and disappointment, it's recommended that you do the quest via MQ because of the three strikes you have against you: an evil race, evil class and worshipping an evil diety.  Illusions helped me when most of my Katta factions were not yet maxed (and most of them are now) but did not help one iota with the final turn in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ogrukk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">perfect, thank you!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xanathol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Just FYI, since I just so happened to have killed Zeefer last night...bring a slower and some DPS. With me ( no bane weap...yeah I am lame, get over it ), druid, cleric, shammy, wizzy, it took us about 30 minutes to kill the bastard. Grant it, shammy wasn't dotting, just clicky nukes, wizzy was holding off on nukes a bit, and druid stopped dotting midway. Why you ask? Bc whie I am sitting there with a procing weapon swinging at him, I am alternating cast of CD and undead DD, chaining CD *constantly*....at about 70%, druid had not dotted, nuked or healed for sometime, all of a sudden, Z took notice of her. I could *not* get him off her ( guess she was too sexy ) till she was dead. The wizzy had been nuking with SoS ( about 10-20 second pauses btw nukes ), the shammy dotting, slowing, crippling...I have NO clue why or how druid got aggro, but she did, so we scaled it from there.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, fuck what alla says - do NOT try to kite this bitch as an SK...get a slower and get comfortable.<br />
<br />
On another note, anyone have any problems of late doing invis turn ins? I sat at max distance ( I think ), harmonied, cast sup camo with druid, and at ~1 bub on timer clicked to give...either I'd get invised too quick and window never came up, or window just never came up and I got beat on. Am I doing something wrong I forgot about?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You have to drop invis first to open trade window.  You prolly know that but your post didn't specifically say.<br />
<br />
Sequence would roughly be:<br />
<br />
1) Invis self<br />
2) harmony/pac Phenic<br />
3) with ashes in hand, drop invis<br />
4) creep into max trade range and open trade window<br />
5) get invis'd by party member<br />
6) /con and if indiff, hit trade</div></div><hr />
