<br />
I don't. I can understand getting addicted to EQ. I myself quit twice, and came back both times. But getting so uppity over not being able to get PoP that night is just off-balance.<br />
<br />
I don't think the woman would have considered him 'geeky' for playing a video game. Hell, any guy that doesn't play video games is somewhat abnormal. Video games, sports, talking about sex and burping, these are the top 4 expectations it seems women have (it seems, key phrase here).<br />
<br />
Him spazzing at the misnaming of Firiona Vie, that would have warded her off though. And her talking to him meant he was going to get laid how, exactly? If she's that easy, I'd feel sorry for him for being so stupid.<br />
<br />
It was his own fault. So the customer service rep was a bit giddy, so what? I think thats better than acting like their dog just died all the time. Don't jump down her throat for trying to make you grin, asshole.<br />

<br />
And I think if that guy spent less time obsessing over video games then maybe he would get laid more often, I wouldn't blame Walmart.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kamlatir</div><div class="date">11-25-2002, 11:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That was hilarious, ironizing over real life in combination with Everquest at it's finest. Seemed a joke to me but most people appeared to take it seriously. Trying to lecture him about not being embarrassed about the &quot;doll&quot; hehe....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ohisee</div><div class="date">11-25-2002, 02:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is what he could have done. <br />
<br />
1. Waited 2 weeks after POP came out and then bought it. That way the store shelves are restocked and all the gotta have it now people are gone.<br />
<br />
2 If he had kept his cool, all he would have had to say was, Yes my niece or whoever is gonna love this for their birthday. Now he looks like the senstive type instead of a hot head.  He lost big points with his big mouth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jobrill</div><div class="date">11-25-2002, 03:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Or he could have smiled, nodded, and bought the game and realized it is not shameful to play Everquest, and if he thinks it is, he sure as hell better stop playin it :p</div></div><hr />

That's bound to have been written by the mind of Sk8erGanome, or it's at least a good attempt at impersonating him.</div></div><hr />

<br />
tho ya gotta admit,,its not really high on the &quot;how impress hot babes&quot; list by going apeshit over a half-nekkid elf doll in a box. <br />
<br />
prolly got pissed off when he found out he couldnt inflate it.,</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PlatPhoenix</div><div class="date">11-25-2002, 11:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, real men look at their girlfriend, say 'I'm gonna buy this, come with me', and proceed to make them accompany them to the video game store.<br />
<br />
Real men don't care what another woman thinks, beause if she gets freaked over a video game, all she'd be is another piece of ass anyway.<br />
<br />
Real men buy the box without the figure, just because all he'd do with it is rip her to shreds and put her plastic head on a pike at home anyway.<br />
<br />
Real SK's hate High Elves, and last I heard, Firiona Vie is a High Elf.<br />
<br />
I am SK. I am Wizard. I am a god (in my own mind). <br />

Yet have no depth to their personality, and no real sense of self. Goths who are goths because it's cool, not because it's who they are<br />

Either way, we think he looks like this:<br />

<br />
oh, as for looking like crap while out buying the game, my mother always told me to dress like I may run into the girl of my dreams at any given moment. not suit and tie 24/7, but just look decent when you go out. <br />
<br />
anyway, funny story, if a bit tragic.</div></div><hr />
