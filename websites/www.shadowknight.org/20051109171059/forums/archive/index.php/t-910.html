Plus is it pretty much a solo/exp group weapon? I could see maybe getting away with one proc in a place like ToV but if it chain proced I would be lizard pace asap I would guess.<br />
<br />
Those that have it, situational weapon at best? I could see it owning for fear kiting and being great in exp groups but it looks like it would be bagged in most raids.</div></div><hr />

 well, the raw melee damage makes this an excellent weapon. The proc itself is a 300 dam over 15 ticks darkness, like Dooming in how much it slows. It overwrites engulfing, and checks resist every tick, making it unreliable on high MR mobs.<br />
<br />
The aggro actually is not THAT bad. I use it a lot on raids, and rarely get I hit more than with Cudgel of Cowardly death.<br />
<br />
If you tend to have trouble in aggro control, however, this one is not your toy.<br />
<br />
I use it as standard issue atm, cause I cant stand the look on Cudgel, and it has sweet stats too. If you have access to Tunare, Vulak stuff, skip it.</div></div><hr />
