<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Noctix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My group is getting to the end of what we can accomplish with LDoN so we are thinking about taking a crack at the sewer trials in GoD sometime soon.  I have a few questions first:<br />
<br />
1) Take a look at my magelo.  Am I big enough to tank the sewer trials?  I'll be buying CA3 tonight or tomorrow and working on CS2/3 after that so you can factor those in.<br />
2) Where does one go to start a sewer mission?  Who do you talk to, how do you select a trial, etc?<br />
3) Which sewer is the best one to start in?<br />
4) How do the trials compare to LDoN adventures?  Are they collects, rescues, assassinates, slaughters, or some mixture of the above?  Something entirely different?<br />
5) How long does each trial take?  My group has limited playtime and I'm hoping we can finish a trial in around 2 hours.  Is this possible?<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if this will change any of the answers to the above questions but our group consists of my SK plus a rogue, wizard, monk, shaman, and cleric.  All characters are roughly at the same stage of progression as my SK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lynxal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Start with Trial 2....the mobs are easy and the win is easy with a rogue....have him find a spoiler so he knows how to do the hand in.<br />
<br />
The pieces you collect are totally random..I doubt you can finish in 2 hours but at least the turn in pieces are rentable so you can keep doing it until you get the 4 you need.<br />
<br />
Trial 1....I doubt you can win without a healthy bit of luck on the boss, even after his downgrade he is mean and your cleric has his work cut out for him.<br />
<br />
There is very little for gear upgrades in the first 4 trials...especially in comparison to your current gear.  To be honest I think they are a waste of time and you would be better served just sticking with LDoN Hards.<br />
<br />
Depending on your groups gear, if you were dead set on doing GoD, I would think your time would be better spent in Riwii....there are some nice ATK pants for the rogue, nice ATk arms for the monk, a fungi tunic upgrade for the monk (so he can sell his old one), and some misc. odd loots that are not bad.  Anything you don't use you can sell.  <br />
<br />
I don't see the first 4 trials doing anything for you other than flagging you for vxed where you'd get hammered.  All things that will become easier for you with OoW, so why struggle now for no real gain...do what you can do easily and still get great rewards...LDoN.  There are a ton of augments and gear possibilities, I don't think you are at the end of your useful LDoN Life.  Just finishing all your AC augs in the 5 available slots is worth your time in there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Eberan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just did the trials for my fiancee so we could get her kod'taz flagged since she hasnt played since the start of luclin really.<br />
<br />
1. Yeah, you can prolly tank them with a decent cleric and a backup healer, altho its most defenaitly not gonna be a walk in the park. Bossmob in Sewer1 migh cause you a bit of trouble as will the unslowable golems.<br />
<br />
2. You talk to the high priest in barindu.<br />
<br />
3. Easiest trial is sewer 2 IMO, however it can take a bit of time. If your taking the expeditions you will get them in order from highpriest.<br />
<br />
4. They are mixtures (these are from memory) :<br />
<br />
Sewer 1 : you have to kill a boss mob that spawns after killing 9 stonemites in the last room.<br />
<br />
Sewer 2 :you have to collect 4 different remains, depending on luck this can take a long time. After that you use the 4 items to spawn 4 nameds whom when you kill,spawn a willowwisp that starts moving towards a room called the crystal room, after the last wips arrives in the room, you got 30 mins to get to the room and hail and npc.<br />
<br />
Sewer 3 : This ones a pain in the arse, clear all the way to last room, hand in quest peice you get after doing sewer 2 to the npc, this spawns special mobs in 3 different rooms in the other side of the sewers, kill mobs in each room till you get text saying that you found a tool, get all 3 tools and return to the npc in the last room.<br />
<br />
Sewer 4 : Another pain in the arse trial, you need to clear to the last room, kill a named gello thing, that then spawns 6 wisps that disappear off to different parts of the dungeon, you need to collect 4 map peices from the 6 wisps and then turn in to npc near the ZI.<br />
<br />
5. Depends on your group, sewer 3 and 4 was by far the longest for us. You can &quot;cheat&quot; here and there and invis parts of the way, but it still takes ages to clear all those mobs. I doubt your gonna do 3 or 4 in 2 hours tho.<br />
<br />
Trial 1 took us over an hour. (had about 3 tries before succeding, we kept getting a buggy spawn)<br />
Trial 2 took about 3 hours, but we were unlucky on drops. (succeded first try)<br />
Trial 3 took about 4 and a half hour. (tooks us 4 tries)<br />
Trial 4 took about 4 and a half hour. (took us 3 tries)<br />
<br />
Considering, these were mainly RF groups with a few random people stuck in here and there, we are prolly better geared than you guys overall. <br />
<br />
You are defenaitly gonna have a hard time with these trials. However, while doing them we got my fiancee 3 quite nice loot drops so the loot isnt bad.<br />
<br />
Regarding your group makeup, a chanter comes in very handy on some of them especially sewer 3 and 4.<br />
<br />
You can also cut alot of time off sewer 3 if you got a rogue, since he can sneak all the way to the npc room and trigger the 3 rooms near ZI for you, sorta cuts the whole trial down to under an hour.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Noctix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for the advice, I appreciate it.  A few questions/comments:<br />
<br />
Trial 1....I doubt you can win without a healthy bit of luck on the boss, even after his downgrade he is mean and your cleric has his work cut out for him.<br />
My cleric is quite good and well geared/AAed for our stage of progression.  If it's even slightly possible, I'm sure he'll keep me alive.  I've been tanking 2 LDoN hard mobs at once for hard breaks lately and he keeps me alive.<br />
<br />
There is very little for gear upgrades in the first 4 trials...especially in comparison to your current gear.<br />
Is there anything at all?  What about augments?  There's virtually no LDoN gear that would be an upgrade for me anymore (Tak bracer I guess but that's a ton of effort for a tiny upgrade).  I can do LDoN augments forever but if I can get similar augments in GoD, it might be cool to see new zones.<br />
<br />
Depending on your groups gear, if you were dead set on doing GoD, I would think your time would be better spent in Riwii....there are some nice ATK pants for the rogue, nice ATk arms for the monk, a fungi tunic upgrade for the monk (so he can sell his old one), and some misc. odd loots that are not bad.  Anything you don't use you can sell.<br />
How does this stuff compare to bazaar gear?  My group really doesn't need pp, we have the best bazaar gear possible.  I have a retarded amount of pp sitting on my bazaar trader in hopes that OOW has some new droppable stuff I can use.<br />
<br />
There are a ton of augments and gear possibilities, I don't think you are at the end of your useful LDoN Life.  Just finishing all your AC augs in the 5 available slots is worth your time in there.<br />
I already have 3 ac augs and I will have the last 2 shortly.  I was planning on finishing up the ac augs and my luclin defensive AAs before heading to the sewers.  Is there anything from LDoN worth me sticking around for after the ac augs?  I guess the answer to the above question about augments answers this one too...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Noctix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks Eberan, a lot of useful information in there.  I'll pass it on to my group and we'll probably come back with some more detailed questions later.<br />
<br />
You can also cut alot of time off sewer 3 if you got a rogue, since he can sneak all the way to the npc room and trigger the 3 rooms near ZI for you, sorta cuts the whole trial down to under an hour.<br />
I also drive the rogue (I'm 3boxing the SK, rogue, and wizard).  I guess I'll be buying SoS as my next AA :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Honestly, you should be fine, with a good healer. Look at my magelo; you're equipped much better than I am. I've finished trials 1-3 now, none of them having more than a cleric, and I did trial 3 with a druid as main healer. I've done all three trials without a loss now, as well as a few farming expeditions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Xanathol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">And pray tell how you tanked the named in trial #1 at the end? /boggle</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I tanked it with the cleric chaining heals on me, tossing HT right off the bat so I didn't have to worry about agro, popping Leechcurse right after for extra help, then chaining lifetaps to help with heals while the rest of my group DPS'd the fuck out of it. I ended up by dying at about 20% hp left on the mob, the beastlord in my group was on the ball, got agro, and hit a disc to finish tanking it. I'm not saying it was easy, or would work every time; but its possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Oberyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">...he ate through two warriors (granted, cleric was new to the class, and Wars were both drinking I think) and I ended up tanking him down from about 40 percent.  <br />
<br />
Was gratifying to see an SK standing at the end.  Was tense, cause we were down to about 1 minute left on the time.  <br />
<br />
He seems to be like a lot of GoD mobs, if the random number generator gets lucky, you hurt.  If it doesn't, you make out ok.<br />
<br />
You'll find out pretty quick on the golem blue guys how well you tank/heal, Noctix.   If you can handle them fairly easily, you stand a good chance on the Big Mite, with care and attention.   <br />
<br />
Your gear is similar to mine, with better Augs by far.  You should be fine, barring bad RNG strings.<br />
<br />

<br />
HT=0 aggro</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The unslowable golems really aren't bad at all;  1100 max hit but their attack rating isn't all that high.  They'll miss a ton, which is more than you can say for the damned stonemites at the end.  Watch for that AE rampage too, it's wiped us several times.  Noc, make sure your cleric gets the bulwark line if he hasn't already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Noctix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Honestly, you should be fine, with a good healer. Look at my magelo; you're equipped much better than I am.<br />
Yes but you have all your defensive AAs and I don't.  I'd like to think that my having better equipment is enough to make up for the AA difference but I have no parses to back that up.<br />
<br />
Noc, make sure your cleric gets the bulwark line if he hasn't already.<br />
Is there any reason for him to get the Bulwark spells other than Bulwark of Vie?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">HT=0 aggro<br />
<br />
Are you sure? Because I've used HT on the odd occasion to get agro back from a chanter or cleric that was getting beaten on something fierce after taunt failed, and I knew I didn't have enough time to wait for refresh or agro off with CD/fear. I've got nothing to back it up, but just from playing and stuff I've noticed quite a bit of agro from HT. I remember getting eaten by Coirnav when the ugly bastard was at 85% (tanked by the same tank the whole time) and me swimming by and HT'ing. I hadn't done anything else but drop HT, and agro automatically went to me. */shrug* I dunno.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Simu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Practices Sewers trial with asking some Exp version. You'll see what they're like, you'll learn eventually where named spawns. You could even manage to get Holy Light for your cleric (much needed) from a named !<br />
<br />
Snplant should be your home for Exp grinding and Named hunting. As much good exp as in LDON Hard, some nice loot from Named... And you'll know how your group performs there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Lynxal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">HT doesn't generate any significant agro.  You can pop your 9k DMG off on a raid the second the MA engages and it won't give you a glance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not about good, it's about lucky.....I was getting continuously healed and the heals would land at either 80% or 20% (at the time)...so you can't afford to really milk a heal out without just pure luck setting in.<br />
<br />
Is there anything at all?  What about augments?  There's virtually no LDoN gear that would be an upgrade for me anymore (Tak bracer I guess but that's a ton of effort for a tiny upgrade).  I can do LDoN augments forever but if I can get similar augments in GoD, it might be cool to see new zones.<br />
<br />
IDIV and FT2 are the only worthwhile augments....there is nothing worthwhile gearwise except the shield for you.<br />
<br />
How does this stuff compare to bazaar gear?  My group really doesn't need pp, we have the best bazaar gear possible.  I have a retarded amount of pp sitting on my bazaar trader in hopes that OOW has some new droppable stuff I can use.<br />
<br />
The items I mentioned are better than bazaar gear.  The monk arms and rogue legs won't be useful however if you have those slots with fully augmented LDoN pieces....plus riwii would be better exp than you are getting in LDoN runs and you need lots of AA.....so I assume your whole group needs lots of AA<br />
<br />
I already have 3 ac augs and I will have the last 2 shortly.  I was planning on finishing up the ac augs and my luclin defensive AAs before heading to the sewers.  Is there anything from LDoN worth me sticking around for after the ac augs?  I guess the answer to the above question about augments answers this one too....<br />
<br />
Finish AC augs, pick up 1 +40HP type 7 aug.  There are other things you personally might not necessarily need from LDoN, but the other characters would be better served with in the long term by staying.....ATK augs, gear, etc.  Right now I could be done myself with LDoN and not care....but I know our rogue and monk have items that they are still working on so in the meantime I'll pick up a type 7 FT2 aug, weapon proc augment,  and 40Hps on my arms.<br />
<br />
The better gear for you is not in the sewers, it's in Ferubi.  The ATK shoulders for monk, rogue, the earrings, regen 2 augs, 20ATK augs, the mana pres 4 range for priest classes, 25/25 augs, 15AC augs, etc.....that being said, you don't have a chance in hell of going far in Ferubi without an enchanter and/or a second tank.  You could get the shoulders off random roamers and maybe the 25/25 augs...the others will be too far in and the respawn/roamers would make it hard to push through.  Try it though for a challenge and see what you can do, the exp is good and if you make it from Q zone line to Rondos room....you win:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Yes but you have all your defensive AAs and I don't.

<br />

<br />
<br />
No reason that I can see, they don't stack and Vie is the top of the line.  You might want to encourage him to put it on himself as well before you start engaging the 9 stonemites to spawn the boss in the first trial.  I'm serious that AE rampage is a bitch, especially if your casters are at all light in the hp gear.  Corner yourself too, IIRC they have a knockback.<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
<br />
Lynxal, if he's doing LDoN high difficulty adventures regularly, Riwwi experience isn't really going to keep up.  Besides which, he's better geared than I am, and I started duoing Ferubi with a Shaman for heals before I had completed CS3.  In order of experience value, I'd rate the zones like this:  Qinimi, Riwwi, Barindu (zone lines only), Ferubi, Sewers (crematory, lair), Sewers (Pool), Sewers (Plant).<br />
<br />
His full group should be able to handle sewers experience only missions, they can pick up some loot and get the much needed AA.  It's really not all that bad once you figure out how the zones work.<br />
<br />
As for gear, after about 3 months of farming Ferubi random trash every chance I got, I finally got a pair of shoulders to drop.  They're that rare.  I'm talking several dozen trips lasting hours at a time.  Thousands of mobs killed.  We saw 5 Idols while we were there before we ever got a shoulder drop.  I'm imagining that the earring from Barindu trash is probably about the same rarity, but hell, I don't have anything else going on...  Now, there are actually some very nice drops from random mini-named in all of the sewers expeditions. I'm not sure that they'll be an upgrade for Noc or anyone in his group, but they're at least worth a look.  Oh, and if you can make it in from the Riwwi or Barindu zonelines in Ferubi to the first &quot;south turn&quot;, you might be able to snag a named dog there that drops a decent belt.<br />
<br />
Point is, most of this tier 1 GoD shit has been retuned to fit for those of us who aren't elemental or beyond.  It's now doable, very much so.  I'm not saying it's not a little hard, or a lot scary the first time you do it, but if you're at all competent and worth being called a level 65 Knight, you'll do fine tanking this shit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Menon Lifeblight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Naelyan, I have no clue how you tanked that named at the end of trial 1.  You were either very lucky, or I was very unlucky.  With 1k more hp and 200 more AC, I failed miserably.  Haven't tried it again since I upgraded my gear, I just brought a warrior along to gimp me through it.<br />
<br />
Also, I'm pretty sure Brael did some testing a while back that showed HT was equivalent in aggro to a 1k nuke.  So it's worth something, just not a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Lynxal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">LDoN hard is not better exp than Riwii...it's better exp on a per mob kill but not necessarily as an overall camp.  The riwii mobs are so easy, and there are so many you kill extremely fast, with no downtime picking the next adventure, buffing up, etc.....I get more experience than I get in LDoN hards in a night.<br />
<br />
Shoulder drops in Ferubi are luck of the draw......we have also only gotten 1 pair in months and letting idols rot after seeing 8 of them.  However, Rhumba's group goes into Ferubi and they have seen more like 8 shoulders and 1 idol.  It's very random.<br />
<br />
Ferubi is definately a lot easier than it was at release with the retuning, but I still don't think a single pre-Time group has a shot at getting into the harder areas without an enchanter or second tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Noctix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Is there someplace better for us to go than GoD?  I feel like we don't have the gear to do Vxed yet but you're saying that there's almost no gear earlier in GoD that could really be considered an upgrade.  Is there just a huge gaping hole in non-raid progression content?  Or are my missing defensive AAs the only reason we can't do Vxed?<br />
<br />
As for my group's AA needs, the monk in my group has the most AA, he's finished all defensive stuff (including ID/LR) and most of his pulling related monk abilities.  Most of the rest of us are between 30 and 100AAs somewhere.  The wizard has no AAs though (justed dinged 65 last week).  She leveled up almost entirely in LDoN and we've twinked the hell out of her so her gear is up to par (max FT, focus effects, etc.).  Still, I think my missing defensive AAs are our biggest problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Well your group should easily be able to do PoJ trials and the Bastion of Thunder key quest in Plane of Storms, which would each give everybody in the group an AA point as well as giving stats to the charm for progressing through the planes, and since you're on E'ci you could tag along on the public lower tier raids to get even more flags, more AAs and more stats.  The weakest piece of equipment I see on you is your second bracer, which you could replace with a Tak bracer or a Rock Molded Wrist Guard fairly easily.  You won't be getting past Tipt/Vxed with that level of gear I don't think, unless you flesh out all your augment slots with AC and HP augs, and even then you might have to wait for the new level cap.  That said, no harm in trying at least once to see how you fare, because if you can get into Kod'Taz there should be some available upgrades there and in the other immediately available zones.<br />
<br />
In other words, yes there is a limit currently to how far you can go without raiding.  If you want to progress your gear significantly beyond what you have, you will most likely need to get some flags and try for some raid loots, or wait for level 70.<br />
<br />
The above statements are my opinions, and if you can prove me wrong that would be great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Rhumba_Kween</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I disagree about the no upgrades until vxed, but thats just me.

A spell haste IV aug drops in the same zone. Does your group have all its GoD spells? They can drop off named in the sewers also.<br />
<br />
Sewers are lots of fun, and if you figure them out, in my experience the named are more plentiful than LDoN.</div></div><hr />

You're right, the shield and augments would be good for me but are those upgrades enough for me to tank Vxed?<br />
<br />
We have no need of FT2 augs.  Cleric and wizard have FT15, Shaman cannis so much he never runs out of mana, and I never run out of mana between PoH and MC.  I wouldn't equip FT2 augs over hp/ac anyway.  As for focus effects, every caster in my group has every level IV focus effect they want either through gear or tribute.  Atk augs would be worth getting I guess.<br />
<br />
GoD spells are certainly worth getting, especially Holy Light.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've just started doing Vxed in the last week. The problem is the disparity between the named and the regular mobs, with a few upgrades, and your defensive AA's, you could tank the non named in Vxed, and like all GoD zones there are super rare (super nice) items that drop off of any mob in zone. But I certainly cannot tank the named there yet. And from what I can tell (unless 70 changes things drastically) I don't have a chance of tanking the named there for quite awhile. So to answer your question, most likely you wont be able to tank the named until level 70. But you need to know that the Sewers are prerequisite to Vxed, so you will want to get going on them anyway, if you plan to have Vxed opened up to you by the time Oow comes out. Also the XP in Vxed is about 5 Percent of an AA per kill. So its a great xp zone also. <br />
<br />
Thankfully I group with a warrior...<br />
<br />
EDIT: Also. I'll emphasize what Sess said before. Work on the easy alternate keys for PoP or hope into some open raids as much as you hate them, so you can get a real charm. With your group, you easily should be able to get it up to 30hps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Rhumba_Kween</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">GoD spells are certainly worth getting, especially Holy Light.<br />

The shammy slow is more game altering than Holy Light. Although both are very nice.</div></div><hr />

Yes.  <br />
<br />
There is nothing in GoD that will let your group beat the named in Vxed if you can't do it now....you have as good a chance trying it now and using monk and rogue discs as you would if you had all the one group items you wanted from GoD up to Vxed.

<br />
I assume you are farming them, meaning leaving after 20 mins if you do not get a named. It's definitely not common. I think its the only one we've seen and we propably did a total of 25-30 attempts at it. Many of those attempts lasted 20 minutes. If there was a deep named they could take up to an hour and half. I think we actually got the shield near the beginning of our farming.<br />
<br />
Definitely not common, but for the crew I hunt with, we've had much better luck with named in Sewers than we've had in LDoN hards. I'd still guess we average 1 named in 3 Ldon's, and probably the same in the sewers, but the difference is that you can bail on the sewer after 20 minutes.</div></div><hr />

How do you know if there are nameds that are easy to get to within the first 20 minutes?  Is a tracker required or is there another way to find out?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Rhumba_Kween</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">How do you know if there are nameds that are easy to get to within the first 20 minutes? Is a tracker required or is there another way to find out?<br />
<br />
We normally don't have a tracker either, so we use a class with Eye of Zomm. Mages, Wizards have it that I know of. I think a few others have it also. These classes can tell if a named is up fairly close. In lair, there are 8 named spawn points within 35 mobs of zone in.<br />
<br />
And if you don't know the way sewers work, its this. Initally when you zone into a sewer no named or their ph's will be up. So all those spawn points will be empty. After roughly 20 minutes, all of those spawn points that were empty before will now get a mob, with them having a chance of being a named. At that 20 minute mark you can then check for named, and decide whether to keep going or bail and start over. Usually in lair we try to get to the end of the first tunnel by the end of the 20 minute mark and can then scout from there with the eye. And like I said from the end of the first tunnel, someone with the eye can get to about 8 spawn points if you know where they are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Prevost</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">You can see up to two named from the first room. In the first hall there's a roamer that can be the named Sludge-Eating Fly and the third mob in the hall on the right (no spawn to start) can pop the named ghost, Rigara the Lost.<br />
<br />
If you use Eye of Zomm from the first room you can see as far as the 2nd room down the hall and stairs and there's at least two more named PH spots there. In the middle for the Blistering Larva and the back left corner can also spawn Rigara the Lost.<br />
<br />
With Bard (bad) Tracking you can also pickup the Sludge-Eating Fly if it spawns in the back of the SE corner of the map.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Xanathol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I tanked it with the cleric chaining heals on me, tossing HT right off the bat so I didn't have to worry about agro, popping Leechcurse right after for extra help, then chaining lifetaps to help with heals while the rest of my group DPS'd the fuck out of it. I ended up by dying at about 20% hp left on the mob, the beastlord in my group was on the ball, got agro, and hit a disc to finish tanking it. I'm not saying it was easy, or would work every time; but its possible.<br />
<br />
So what you're saying is you got very fucking lucky to last most of the fight, still died and a DPS class disc tanked it till it was dead. And you had to be *very* lucky, or had a ton of burst DPS on the mob, to last that long. My gear isn't on par with Brael's pocket lint, but I am far better geared than you, and 3 healers failed to keep me alive on the fucker last time I tried ( cleric, druid, and shammy in the group ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Darkmourn D`Estrellas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Just to clarify a bit, it's not 20 minutes.  That would lead you to believe you could just start an instance and sit at zone in for 20 minutes waiting to see if named pop.  You have to kill X number of mobs, which is typically around 20.  It is not the same every time from what I can tell.  After you kill the X'th mob, all the blank spots in the spawns fill in, and that is where the named can be.  You'll learn to recognize which spawns are ones that signify the named could be up.  Particularly the first time you pull a room that only has 2 mobs in it, and upon killing one of them suddenly 3 more and a roamer appear.  Once you learn those quirks, it's easy.  Oh, and a named can spawn on a repop of the &quot;normal&quot; mobs as well (the ones that are up when you zone in, before the &quot;trigger&quot; number is hit).  But I can't guarantee that 2 of the same named can be up at the same time (never seen it happen) so you can't just keep killing near zone in and expect an eventual pop, if one is up deeper in zone.<br />
<br />
Just for comparisons, I've done sewers, particularly Lair, a lot of times.  I've seen Rigara like 4 times, compared to probably 15-20 each of the fly and the larva.  Got the shield the first time.  Each mob seems to have a common drop, so get used to a lot of stuff rotting.  Out of all of those flies we've only had 2 spell haste augs, and the larva has only once dropped a FT2 aug, and twice the +15 atk aug.  Oh, and a whopping total of 3 spell runes (6 if you count the 3 that dropped when the actual spell dropped instead of a generic rune).<br />
<br />
The only way to know if a named is up is tracking (which sucks even for rangers in those zones) or have a rogue SoS through the whole thing and just look.  To give an idea of tracking range, if you look at the map of the Lair there is a room directly east of the zone in room.  Physically it is pretty close, but you have to fight around in a big U to get to it.  A druid standing at the zone in spot after succoring was unable to track the named in that eastern room.  So unless you've got a rogue, you just have to hope it spawns close.<br />
<br />
*EDIT* Took too long making my post, so a lot has been already answered.  Forgot about Eye of Zomm.  And yes, our druid was able to track if she went over to the very far east corner of the zone in room.  But I think that's only because the mob spawned in the west side of that other room.  If it were farther away I doubt she'd have been able to.<br />
<br />
*Further Edit*  You could also bind sight/assiduous vision through the sewer I suppose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Prevost</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Darkmourn, how far in do you clear for named? I only go as far as the 2nd room and then zone out. I have only gotten 3 named flies in that area, about 15+ Riagara and 10+ Larva.<br />
It's the Flies I want for spells/cape and augs, but they've been so much rarer for me.<br />
<br />
I concurr that it's a triggered spawning of names in the instance also as I've had named pop at 9 and 19 or so mobs killed and anywhere in-between.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Darkmourn D`Estrellas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">We typically only go after a named if it is in that U I described from the zone in to the eastern room.  If you've ever gone past the water area, you'll know what I'm talking about when I say it simply isn't worth it to go after a named beyond that.  You can invis all the way through the water, but as soon as you come out there is a see invis ghost, with another mob close behind him.  That wouldn't be so bad, but that spot is roamer central, and at one time we've had 6-8 mobs there.  Certainly doable with a bard or chanter, and I can 3 or 4 tank when needed, but it's not worth the hassle.<br />
<br />
I am actually happy we haven't seen Rigara more, because after his shield and I think a chanter bracer (both of which we've gotten), there is absolutely nothing our group wants from him.  But I'm sure it's just all random/luck of the draw.<br />
<br />
Oh, and please let me know if you EVER see one of those Larva-skinned capes (that goes for anyone on the board too).  From reading Alla's people say the fly drops it, but others say it is random.  I've done enough Lair where I think I would have seen at least one random trash mob drop something if that were possible, but I'm starting to think it might only be the first sewer (Plant maybe?) that has the 1100+ hitting mobs that can drop stuff from random mobs.  I've never seen it happen (only done that one a few times) but it might make sense (like anything Sony does makes sense) to have the one with the hardest hitting mobs give random rewards.  We've got a couple of bots that desperately want those cloaks for the extended range focus, but I'm starting to think maybe we'll have to look elsewhere to get it.  Same thing goes for the Earring of the Moondancer and the Turepta Spine Ring (think that's the name).  If anyone has seen those drop, please let me know, and which sewer and mob if you can remember.  And if it was pre sewers nerf or post.  Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you sure about this? Have you ever sat around the zone in and tried? Obviously not a big deal, but we pretty much always make it to the same spot if we start fighting right away. Only one time did they spawn before we got to our normal spot, and on that occasion we'd wasted a good 5+ minutes adding a different person after we'd started. It's obviously not a huge deal, but it sure seems like 20 miutes ish to me, vs. a set number of mobs.<br />
<br />
EDIT: And one time when we did it with only one tank and extra dps, we actually had all the mobs killed into the third room before the spawn happened. From my count that was at least 25 mobs, and usually it happens right at the 20-21 for us. It just seems odd the one time we had super high dps, it took way more mobs than normal before it spawned.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Noctix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Ok, after a few delays, we're going to try the sewers tonight.  Just a couple quick questions:<br />
<br />
1) Where do people usually bind for sewer trials?  Both melee and casters please.  We have a wizard so TL is something to consider.<br />
2) We did a little scouting and found that getting a GoD mission isn't quite as trivial as getting a LDoN mission because there are a lot of hard hitting mobs on the way to the high priest.  Where does the group usually wait while the leader goes.  Also, which of our classes (sk, monk, rogue, cleric, shaman, wizard) can best travel to the high priest?<br />
3) Where is a safe and convenient spot to camp each night if we want to do sewers every time we log in?<br />
4) What is the quickest/easiest way to get to the high priest coming from the old world or PoK?  I'm assuming we start at an adventurer's camp but maybe I'm missing something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Darkmourn D`Estrellas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">1)  Nowhere to bind in GoD that I'm aware of, unless maybe you can bind at the Natimbi adventurer camp.  So bind doesn't really matter at all, particularly if your wizzy has the Natimbi port.  Have him buy it immediately if he doesn't have it.  No matter what you do, you're stuck making that run (unless they add those new ports on Tuesday).<br />
<br />
2)  Group waits at the sewers zone in room.  It's completely safe unless someone trains it.  Rogue or SK would be the best person to go get the trials, and since you want a rogue to be the one that gets the note for one (trial 3 I think?) you should have the rogue do them all.  He can wedge in the corner near the high priest to get the mission without aggro.<br />
<br />
3)  Camp in the same spot, the sewers zone in room, every night.  If anyone has buff bots (like C3 since you guys have no enchanter), camp them there as well.<br />
<br />
4)  You start at any adventurer camp and say &quot;Nedaria&quot; to the magus.  In Nedaria, say &quot;Natimbi.&quot;  Or port there once your wizard has the spell.  In Natimbi, invis and lev and run around the wall of the zone to Qinimi.  In Qinimi, run around the wall to your right (or through the middle once you get familiar) to Barindu.  Careful of see invis ukuns and kyv's in that area.  In Barindu, run through the corridor of invis dropping death, taking the right branch each time (they always rejoin, but the last one will take you out to a safer spot than the left).  If invis drops on someone during that run, run as far as you can but if you see the pyramid in front of you, stop there and die.  Training the zone in room is bad.  If your invis held, everyone go into the temple and the back right room to the zone in room.  I can't count the number of times my shaman bot got slaughtered on that run because of random timed invis :(  If your wiz has exodus (or whatever theirs is called) have him run with the cleric in case invis drops.  Getting the cleric to the safe spot is your highest priority, otherwise the cleric will have to make the run all over again, but naked now too.  From that room, send your rogue out to the High Priest while you all sit nice and safe.<br />
<br />
Good luck :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Thakalas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">1) There's pretty much jack and shit for bind points in GoD.  Considering CR difficulty if you're at all deep in the trial, I usually just bind my cleric at a bank to get invis potions and run him to the sewers entrance then exit the expedition to dump corpses out.  Otherwise I'd think at an adventure camp if you don't need to bank.  Near the wizard might be another good choice, depending on where you can port.  I really have no idea on that.<br />
<br />
2) I always park my group right at the entrance to the sewers, it's safe there so long as some idiot doesn't train the spot.  Can't help on the getting to the high priest part, we've only ever done the ghetto versions to experiment and try for loot.<br />
<br />
3) Same as 2<br />

4) Adventurer's camp I believe, though again I'm not at all familiar with the GoD port spells.  I seem to recall a lot of complaints though, so I'm assuming they aren't deep in at all.<br />

<br />
1) Although it's not the BEST nor CLOSEST place, I bind in EC.  I can still run to PoK in a few mins, or use the Magus' to get back.  Admittedly, this is partially influenced by my having an inactive cleric and inactive SoS rogue parked in Barindu for CR.<br />
<br />
2) Any class that can invis would be fine.  However, the person requesting the expedition (if it's a flagging expedition) will get the lowest sewer trial for which they are NOT yet flagged for.  That doesn't apply to the xp versions of the trials but an invising class would still be good to request the expedition too.<br />
<br />
3) Fairly safe spot is inside the pyramid just outside the entrance to the instance.  It may get trained however.  It's best because generally you don't have to invis there as most peeps are courteous about training there.  The Ferubi zone isn't far away and is usually clear, and also the Qinimi zone which although is farther away from the pyramid, is usually safe.  Myself I generally camp at &quot;the rocks&quot; which is the zone in to Vxed/Tipt and since it's a dead end -- not many trains there but it can happen of course.<br />
<br />
4) Until OoW when druids and wizzies get the [supposedly] easy quest for ports to Barindu, currently it's LDoN Magus -&gt; Nedaria Magus -&gt; Natimbi Magus, then run to Qinimi Court, then to Barindu.  As soon as the Barindu ports go in, I'm going to move most of my characters out of Barindu -- I can't seem to do much else without a big hassle moving them all back every day.<br />
<br />
Since this took me so long to post, the questions have probably already been answered but hope it helps.</div></div><hr />

Question about this...how do you get the &quot;ghetto version&quot; of the instanced zone?  Can we just zone right in if we're camped at the pyramid without talking to an NPC?  I imagine we're going to want to farm the zones a little bit and level up to 67 or so before trying Vxed so there's no reason for us to do the flag versions right away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Thakalas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">It's just the non-trial version for loot/xp.  If you start from the sewers entrance, keep hanging lefts until you're outside the pyramid then circle around to the wall.  There's one of the little GoD elf guys there named Gamesh.  Hail him and he talks some, then you can say one of 4 phrases to trigger any of the sewers zones.  Those versions don't allow you to do the trial parts of any of it, but you can choose which zone and you have the normal chance at named critters and any drops.<br />

My first impression was that it's pretty lame.  The dps of trash mobs was a joke compared to LDoN hard mobs, I easily took like 20% of the damage I would normally take against an LDoN mob (not parsed, just an impression...our cleric was nuking a ton and sitting at near full mana though).  However, the mobs seem to have extremely high ac/hp compared to LDoN mobs, so they take a long time for us to kill.  Long fights against low dps mobs seems pretty dull!<br />
<br />
We did get one named (the Larva).  Dropped monk boots and the Eril spell rune (shaman turned it in for his heal spell).  I would say that the Larva was about on par with an LDoN hard named, nothing to write home about.<br />
<br />
How hard exactly does the boss for trial 1 hit and how fast?  Everyone seems to think he's going to be pretty hard for us but unless he's a LOT harder than the nameds, I'm not gonna worry too much.<br />

Was talking more to Simu who sounded like they did not have a rogue. Yes, rogue definitely better, just wanted to mention that its not the only option though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>senor sperro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">just finished trial 1 last night, plant i think.  after a bit of trouble aka wiping at first we had to get another expedition cuz our corpses were too far in.  after that it was almost but not quite smooth sailing.  group of war, two shammies, cleric, and a necro.  war tanked most of the stuff but he went down once and i tanked that unslowable golems.  yeah they suck.  we invised past most of the zone though, invis for golems etc, and ivu for the ghosts.  we hailed that one quest NPC and after that invised almost the rest of the way.  the hardest part is the time it took, almost 3-4 hours including our first attempt...  but the last mobs is cake if u got the healage and dps.  pull those nine critters to spawn the bigger critter and kill his arse.  with ur magelo u could probly tank there alright noct.  and watch out for those horseshoe crabs cuz sometimes they are hard to see.  yay</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Xanathol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">Folks don't mention sewer 1 being hard bc of the trash; its the named at the end which he'd be hard-pressed to tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Lynxal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">Trial 1 trash mobs are much harder than trial 2 and 3 mobs....and the trial 1 boss is substantially harder than any of the named you are killing.  It's at least like the difference between LDoN Hard named and LDON Hard assasinate mobs which I know you are more familiar with.<br />
<br />
The trash in trial 1 is harder than the trash in LDoN hards because the damage is a lot streakier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Darkmourn D`Estrellas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">Also, sewer 1 has the hardest hitting mobs, one on one, but they are are pretty spread out so you almost always only have one mob, maybe 2, making the trash part of it really easy.  Sewer 3 on the other hand (I think it's 3, it's Lair of the Trapped Ones though is the one I mean) has mobs that hit for a little less, but there are several spots where you're likely to get 4 or more adds.  Coming up out of the water in particular where the see invis ghost stands is one of the more likely spots for adds.  We killed 8 mobs at that one spot because they kept adding.  Definitely the hardest of the 4 sewers in my opinion just because of the vastly higher number of roamers.<br />
<br />
Crematory is by far the easiest, mob and roamer-wise.  I forget how tough the other one was, but I think it was 2nd easiest.  Then Plant, then Lair for the hardest.<br />
<br />
Difficulty of end mob or actually completing the trial isn't considered in this rating, please keep in mind.  I'm talking about general clearing of mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Noctix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">We did sewer 1 last night and ended up wiping on the Ancient because we didn't know where he was going to spawn and he ended up agroing on our casters first.  My SK and the monk feigned when the cleric went down and all our other chars died.<br />
<br />
We did quite well in the zone up until then though.  We cleared the entire way to the stonemite room.  We had a few deaths on the stonemites early on but we figured out some tactics that let us kill the last 5 or 6 easily without any deaths.  For one, we figured out that having levitate on my SK was key to allowing him to stay out of the water and cast to keep agro.  Second, we figured out that we needed to keep our rogue and monk from attacking until after malo, slow, and cripple landed; this cut down on our rampage problems a LOT.<br />
<br />
We're going to try sewer 1 again tonight.  However, I have a few questions:<br />
<br />
1) We haven't rezed from last night yet.  Should our corpses just pop out of the zone and if so, where will they be?  Also, is there a way to force an instant pop (by getting a new expedition or something)?<br />
<br />
2) Can the Ancient be slowed?<br />
<br />
3) Where exactly does the Ancient spawn?  I think it's near the center of the room but I can't say for sure as he runs pretty fast and may have moved before I saw him.<br />
<br />
4) Are there any rules for who the Ancient agros first or does it just depend on who he sees first?<br />
<br />
5) Does the Ancient see invis?<br />
<br />
6) Is there anything between zone in and the stonemite room that we can't invis past?  While we were able to clear to that room, it took a long time and we'd prefer to invis past as much as possible this time.  If there are mobs that see through invis, where are they exactly?<br />
<br />
7) Are there any requirements on number of mobs killed in order to do the hail to spawn the stonemites etc., similar to how you have to kill 20ish to spawn the nameds?<br />
<br />
Any other tips on this trial are welcome as well  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Darkmourn D`Estrellas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">1) They will pop outside at the safe room you enter an expedition at.  I'm not sure how fast you can pop them out, but I know that if you all leave the expedition while inside, it boots you out in like 2 minutes.  Definitely all leave it to speed up corpses popping at least.<br />
<br />
2)  I don't remember, but I think he was unslowable.  I'm sorry I don't have a definite answer for you.<br />
<br />
3)  From my experience he spawns fairly randomly around the room.<br />
<br />
4)  Probably whomever is closest.  It went for our cleric first and I had to peel it off.<br />
<br />
5)  Never checked, but I'm doubtful that invis will work on it.<br />
<br />
6)  As someone stated before, each sewer has different mobs that see invis.  Typically it is either ghosts or poos, but I can't remember from sewer to sewer.  Sewer 1 is one of the ones with fewer roamers, so you should be ok to invis for stretches and charge mobs that see invis, or pacify perhaps, then invis more, etc.  Sewer 3 is virtually impossible to do that on because of the buttload of roamers.<br />
<br />
7)  Sorry, unknown to me also, we killed there in order to get some xp.<br />
<br />
Good luck :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>senor sperro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">what we did on last boss in plant was have all the casters stay up on the ledge above some of the pipes.  it makes it easier for the MT to get agro w/o problems.  the boss mob cannot be slowed from what i hear and we tanked em w/o slow also.  did plant again yesterday but it was so late we just logged off.  just get cleric heals and other heals and u should be ok.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Oberyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">...does not see invis , or I should quantify that by saying &quot;I spent a lot of time in that room invis and he never agro'd and was indifferent&quot;.  <br />
<br />
In my experience, unless you get very lucky, you cannot invis all the way to the mite room as a group.   You are ok past the water well, usually, we never encountered a see invis past that point, but prior to that, there is a mix of undead and living mobs, and see invis mobs.  You have to get pretty lucky, moving as a group, to get past.  The well room usually has a ghost and a golem up close to one another on the rim, and can be tricky.  You CAN cut a lot of time off if your group is competent, by carefully picking off the see invis mobs as you move.  Usually, in my experience, some dummy goes afk 5 seconds too long, or doesnt see the &quot;MOVE now&quot; message, and gets toasted, usually someone critical. You may have better luck/skill.<br />
<br />
<br />
My group was wiped out on our first try, in the mite room, leaving me FDed and barely alive.  Since I was the only one who could summon corpses, and we had time for another try, I flopped and invised my way up to the top, but had quite a while in the mite room regenning to study him, and his pathing.  Why I dont think he sees invis.   There is a safe spot at the rear right past a large low hanging pipe, on the ledge, where he wont agro, for a CR (or was).<br />

<br />
I haven't got great gear, had the shammy helping on spot heals, and nuked it down hard.<br />
<br />
My normal approach in a marginal fight is agro hard, get AoP up then keep rolling with Touch of Innoruuk, fear (for agro), Touch of Volatis. <br />
<br />
Touches crit quiet often - a 900 + heal can make a difference when your ass is on the line.</div></div><hr />
