<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rothund</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering, what exactly would someone w/o the faction that was MQing the BoA from sky see / do to successfully MQ... I already lost some other stuff trying to get that damn sheath from Teydar, was wondiering what i could do to prevent the same thing from happening again.. should they hand in item, hide, then click give when they get an indiff con? i dunno, i know little about MQing stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hide, or have someone invis them once the trade window is up.  Once they've verified they're indiff, turn in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thingiemethong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I did this last week.. <br />
<br />
1 Ogre War ( no hide option ) with a Fear SL to MQ and a guildie SK who provided me with the BoA piece.. <br />
<br />
I used my wife's 54 Druid to invis the War .. She was standing in the paineel newbie field .. and targetted the war thru the window where duriek is standing..  los and no agro from the green guards..  <br />
<br />
War first, Guildie second ( he used hide ) and I turned in the rest of the goodies..  <br />
<br />
10 min later we did Lhranc.. ;-)</div></div><hr />
