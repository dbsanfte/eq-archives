<br />
No, I got tired but I'm going to start looking again soon.  also we are all a little demoralized that this place got bought out.  even if we dont blame SV, its still sad.  Like knowing your mom has to turn tricks to buy her heroin now that she spent all her lottery money.</div></div><hr />

Which is a better guide?<br />
Personally, I think Bonnie Hunt was the better guide, but other people go with Una Damon.<br />
Why do we love? <br />
Really depends on your definition of love.<br />
Do we even know what love is?<br />
I guess you don't.<br />
Why don't people have power over themselves?<br />
I'm very curious...just who do you think has this power if not the individual?<br />
What if there was a third sex? <br />
I'm going to assume that you mean gender, because if you mean position, you are sadly lacking imagination.<br />
What if people saw colors differently?<br />
They do.<br />
Do we all perceive things differently?<br />
Duh!<br />
Are animals capable of intraspecies communication?<br />
Yes.  However, thank whatever celestial being you worship that they just don't get along, otherwise we would be the first one's against the wall when they coordinated a revolt.<br />
WHY ARE WE HERE?<br />
To support SOE.<br />
Why do we wear clothes?<br />
Maybe this will help you: Under our clothes, we are all naked!<br />
Why did ancient civilizations all come up with the same ideas?<br />
I don't recall every civilization coming up with the idea that shrinking heads was a good thing.<br />
Is my cornhole the source of all evil?<br />
No, just a vile stench.<br />
In ancient times how did people know which things, like plants, were good and what they did? <br />
Process of elimination.<br />
Why can't we crack our knuckles right after we crack them?<br />
The gas that was trapped in them has been released.  It will take time for more to build up.<br />
What is DEATH?<br />
A word.<br />
How would our lives be changed by making contact <br />
with an alien species?<br />
Contact has already been made.  You will be given instructions for reporting to your new leaders shortly.</div></div><hr />
