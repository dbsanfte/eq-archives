<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jayson18</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey everybody,<br />
<br />
I recently caught a few ads on Spike TV for their upcoming Video Game Awards (it airs Dec. 14th but I'm not sure what time, check out their website if you want) and thought to start this thread to see who everyone thinks should win the award for game of the year. Maybe we could tally up the replies here and then compare them to which game actually wins that night? It might be cool too to send these results to Spike TV after we're done, especially if our favorites aren't on their list. So I'm going to dig around and try to find a way to contact them too.<br />
<br />
Here's this year's choices from Spike's website (if you don't agree, just put down your favorite):<br />
<br />
Burnout 3: Takedown (Electronic Arts)<br />
Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas (Rockstar Games)<br />
Half-Life 2 (Vivendi Universal Games)<br />
Halo 2 (Microsoft Game Studios)<br />
Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater (Konami)<br />
<br />
Also, what's your all-time favorite? (I'm predicting Super Mario Brothers and CS will top the list here.)<br />
<br />
Thanks everyone and I'll keep you posted on who wins in case you won't catch it.<br />
<br />
Jason</div></div><hr />

As it is right now every TV related video game review, award, or host (with the exception of X-Play hosts... too bad the station still managed to fuck their show up though, too bad Adam/Morgan deserve way better and I'm not just saying that because I'm obsessed with Morgan which you would find is true if you sat in a channel with me or have seen my ICQ conversations with some people) is sucktacular... the guys who run those networks have to be fucking idiots is all I can say.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Daywalka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">All of those games, except Burnout, were released within the past month and a half. That's fucked up. Oh well, GTA will win, because that's what all the mindless kids like to play anyway. I really hate GTA games, and I'm not sure why. Maybe it's because I tend to dislike any new games that don't have online multiplayer support (aka Xbox Live). Online multiplayer can turn a crappy single-player game into a good title with alot of playtime in it. Much like it did with World Championship Poker. It really sucks single player, but playing with 5 other people is kinda fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">With the plethora of online poker readily available - free, micro limit, or reasonable stakes - why in the hell does one need an online poker console game?  Go to absolute poker or something and play to your heart's content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>kharan_zechts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The best game ever is Xenogears.<br />
But if I had to pick from that list I would say MGS3. GTA is starting to get old and boring for me.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Chanaluss Neiton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">welp, of those 5 games, prolly the least painful is snake eater. but the halo/GTA fanboi's will take one or the other to the top. I didnt like any of the games on that list that much EXCEPT snake eater. Since noone likes Nintendo they decided to conveniently ignore Tales of Symphonia, Metroid Prime 2:Echoes, or Baten Kaitos<br />
<br />
As for my favorite game of all time, i have a list of 5.<br />
<br />
Tales of Symphonia (GCN 2004)<br />
Super Metroid (SNES 1994)<br />
Lufia 2 Rise of the Sinistrals (SNES 1996)<br />
Seiken Densetsu 3 (Super Famicom circa 1995)<br />
Front Mission 3 (PSOne Circa 2000)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Leafweir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I tried MGS3 for about 5 minutes and got pissed off. It takes itself too seriously from the get go, and the points of view are completely screwed up. There is no tutorial, they just dump you into the game and let fly.<br />
<br />
Halo 2 I liked alot.<br />
<br />
Haven't played the other 3.<br />
<br />
As far as best game of this year? I'd have to say World of Warcraft by a large margin. (So far KotR 2 isn't bad either)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hehe, I'm obsessed with Morgan too.  They had a nice pictorial of her in Maxim or Stuff a couple months back.  Xplay is/was one of the most honest shows when it comes to game reviews, and Morgan's love of RPGs was a definite plus.<br />
<br />
Favorite games:  Right now my favorite games are Mortal Kombat Deception, Kareoke Revolution 3, and Taiko drummer.  As far as RPG, Everquest really eats all that time.</div></div><hr />

What are you insane? You must of not undestood how stupid the story was cause if you did you would not be saying its a good game. 99% of the people i've talked to who said it was a good had no clue what the game was really about.. the .1% just really like stupid shit.The game had potential. Get rid of the stupid mechs because they sucked in this game and make a story that doesn't have 2 hours of worthless bullshit when you get to the second cd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Covi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">mine was my very first rpg on the Atari 2600 ...think it was called Adventure or some shit...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Krudler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Wow what a terrible list for the top 5 games....those shows usually pick the games that don't require an attention span of more than 5 minutes.  <br />
<br />
My favorite game of all-time was an RPG called Shadowrun (SNES).  FFII and FFIII were pretty classic, as were Fallout 1 &amp; 2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Why is it impossible for parents to buy hot-demand new PlayStation2? Because a month ago, an oil tanker became jammed in the Suez Canal, closing the waterway for the first time in 40 years and blocking several cargo ships bearing containers of electronic toys bound to stores for the holidays. The trade publication EuroGamer calls the situation &quot;grave&quot;. Sony has reacted in globalized terms by chartering Russian-built Antonov cargo planes to fly to China and pick up game consoles from the factory, then ferry them to the United States and European Union. Each plane can hold 40,000 PlayStation2 consoles, but apparently even deliveries of 40,000 consoles per plane will not meet Christmas demand. Meanwhile, Nintendo is also leasing aircraft to fly more of its impossible-to-find DS handheld game from the factory in China to the United States. Imagine trying to explain to Chinese peasants living in shacks whose tin roofs are held in place by stones that children in the United States are crying because a global airlift cannot bring them video games quickly enough. <br />

My friend you have just declared War<br />

The story was fucking amazing. I have never experienced an rpg, an anime, or any kind of science fiction with a story like this game had. It had so many interesting plot twists and some of the best character development I've ever seen. Not only that, but the way they presented the story was excellent. From the end of the first cd onto the second cd the story really takes off. I liked it because all of the characters good and bad were real people. The bad guys werent just some cliche retards out to conquer the world. They had real reasons for doing the things they did. The Music in the game was excellent. The mecha was pretty cool also. Of course, nothing is perfect, there are some parts I didn't like (like that stupid chu-chu part in shevat). But the overall story and the overall feeling you get from the game was awesome. Its much like evangelion(people who worked on eva did the anime scenes in this game). You rant on about other people who liked the game, but do you even know what it was really about?<br />
<br />
I'm sorry if you have a short attention span, lack of intelligence, and/or don't enjoy long cutscenes. Go play contra or mortal kombat or something. (Not bashing these games btw, they are mad fun)<br />
<br />
Anyway, FF6(3e) and Phantasy star 2 and 4 were awesome. Final Fantasy Tactics was the shit too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>nezzka is sexy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">actually my favorite game was shaq-fu for snes</div></div><hr />

<br />
by the time i got to the first major castle town with prince bart i immediately lost interest in it. theres no real likeable characters in it, at least not enough to say its the best game ever made.  Xenosaga was much better, tho the movies were extensive</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Odiumar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">The best game ever is Xenogears.<br />

Was Maxim she also had one in FHM in Novembers issue, but personally I didn't really like either photoshoot she did.  But as I said though, Xplay got fucked up when G4 bought it.  No good station actually talks about video games now, and the whole MTV like feel that G4 has or Spike TV's award show they reran last night makes me sad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Silvershadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">DooM and DooM II. Oh, the hours wasted on those two games slaughtering my friends...<br />
<br />
The Delta Force series of games was wonderful fun also. And Super Mario Kart for the SNES.<br />
<br />
Hell, tons of games were fun, but I guess these stood out in hours played. Until Evercrack took that title, anyway.<br />
<br />
Special cudos to Combat on the Atari 2600, that was pure fun as a kid.</div></div><hr />

Yes Music was awesome, i have the soundtrack. Anime was awesome.Characters was awesome, i loved the furry guy.Mechs were cool in the beginning until you realize theres not much you can do in a mech except waste all your oil doing the same attacks over.My most complaint was the story.When i play the game i want the entire story to be good not just one part. I was into it in the beginning but then there was parts where i was like what the hell am i fighting for again? You thought the second cd is where it kicked off? i think thats where it went straight downhill.I Don't wanna give out spoilers so if you want to talk more in detail send me a pm.This is the one true game i wish i never spent over 70 hours on.PS2 owned i still know the entire game by heart.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Ghismonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Fable was disappointing.  XBOX needs better RPGs.<br />
<br />
My favorite non-EQ video game is still Super Mario Kart for the SNES, although all of the FF series (especially VII) are very entertaining and well done.  I'm likely to try anything Square puts out for that reason alone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>kharan_zechts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">If you really follow the story, the end of the first disk and the second disk is where things really start to get interesting. The problem with the second disk is that the game was rushed. They ran out of time and money so they made the second cd just a bunch of long cutscenes and dongeons because they had so much story they had to get out and not enough time to do it. This is the reason why you only see anime scenes in the beginning and the end of the game. They also omitted 2 anima relics which would have have gone to maria and emerelda.<br />
I agree the battle system could of used a little work.<br />
This game would of been incredible if they fully completed the entire thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Mordosskul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I haven't played any of those new games you posted yet~<br />
<br />
As for best of all time? A toss up between Fallout 2 and FF7 probably. Wizardry 8 might rank up there too, that was a pretty underrated and unknown game.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Velnarin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">Ocarina of Time!  I can't believe no one has said it yet.  I beat that game like 6 times on N64.  Even today it's a great game, but at the time I was totally blown away by nearly every aspect of the game.<br />
<br />
I definately have to give honorable mentions to System Shock 2, Final Fantasy 6, Chrono Trigger, Thief 1&amp;2, Burgertime (you all know that game is the shit) and Fallout.<br />
<br />
Also have to mention Beyond Good and Evil.  The game sold like crap, but the graphics were pretty good, the voice acting and script are better than 99% of the games out there, and it was an all around solid game.  Damn, the music in that game is insanely good too.  Amazing game and yet so easily overlooked it seems.</div></div><hr />

X-2 had several Minigames in it so dont know which one you mean, but it was the one with Yuna, Rikku, Payne. Mission based storyline that plays right after FFX. (well a few years later)</div></div><hr />

yeah im weird.. but between the naked easter egg girls hidden throughout (sailor moon, lara croft, toilet girl, et cetera) the randy rabbits and his commentary it was frickin hillarious<br />

It's the one that the main char is supposed to be really good at in his world.  It's like extreme waterpolo plAYED UNDER WATER, AND YOU COULD SIGN CONTRACTS WITH DIFFERENT people as you progressed through the game.<br />

Everquest is a remarkable game full of glitches, nightmare CS stories, spaghetti programming, among other things.  I think it is a success because of the players rather than the producers...we were hungry for a game of its type at the time, and it was the best there was at the time.  It has gotten better in some ways over time, and worse in others.  I still enjoy it, but there are definitely things about it that can really piss ya off day to day.</div></div><hr />

Yeah sorry i forgot about that one in my list, like so many older console games. And yeah my personal conclusion is that these old Genesis/NES/SNES games pretty much own any newer 3D oriented RPGs like some Sudeki or Fable crap for XBOX.~ :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Papetto Soulrender</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">Hmmm, I think my favorite games would have to be...<br />
<br />
1) The Jak series, Love the gameplay, the cutscenes, the characters, and the games themselves are beautifully made. (can't wait to get Jak 3)<br />
2) Fury, old Windows sci fi where you fly a ship around and blow things up...why ask for more?<br />
3) Tony Hawk Pro Skater Underground 2, skateboard, break things, hurt people, and do grafitti, $$$<br />
4) Diablo. Monsters from hell come and kill people and you get to hack and slash...teh winz man.<br />
and last but not at all the least in its many ways...<br />
5) Everquest, it's a love hate kind of game...sometimes you want it, the people, and the jackass n00bie in you group to die, and sometimes you just like to chill with your hunting crew and kill dragons, gods, and alike and get the lewt, if it weren't for the people and it was a 1 player game it wouldn't be worth playing it.<br />

Unfortunatly, I don't play EQ anymore, and even if I did, I couldn't do that cuz I broke the shit out of my arm in a hockey game.I put 2 bones through my growthplate, fractured another bone in my wrist, and to top it all off, my ligements are really fucked up.  So now I have a plain white cast, way past my elbow, that isn't even waterproof because I have pins in my arm.<br />

My daughter plays this one from time to time.  In fact, the Zelda games were her inspiration to read.  She wanted to learn to read to know what the characters were saying to each other.  She still knows all the songs by heart.<br />
<br />
When she was three years old, she used to play Zelda for the SNES too.  She used hit the creatures with a sword and say &quot;Die, die, die.&quot;  Then when they would die, she would apologize.  &quot;Oops, sorry.&quot;  Then she would happily move on to the next one and kill it in the same fashion.</div></div><hr />

16, they said it was almost closed, and that I should be fine, but I'm like 5'7, my friend is 6'2, my arms are as long as his, so it's not like I'm gonna have a gimpy short arm if it stops.</div></div><hr />

As it is right now every TV related video game review, award, or host (with the exception of X-Play hosts... too bad the station still managed to fuck their show up though, too bad Adam/Morgan deserve way better and I'm not just saying that because I'm obsessed with Morgan which you would find is true if you sat in a channel with me or have seen my ICQ conversations with some people) is sucktacular... the guys who run those networks have to be fucking idiots is all I can say.<br />

Nah but you are right, the bullshit G4 did with tech tv's shows, moving the TechTv studios to los angeles,Switching the Cast of the Screen Savers to a more hip young crowd HAHAHAHA, Leo Laporte and Patrick his last name escapes me atm :o  were the guys that got tech tv watched more, i remember they were so popular over on the east coast they went from a Hour to a Hour and a Half, but they just couldnt fill the whole time slot so it went back to a hour<br />
<br />
Leo was hosting 3 shows(the show went downhill after they took Morgan Webb off TSS imo, and kat, and martin seargent)They even had some blonde haired idiot(ok maybe he's not a idiot,but i dont like him lol) try to fill that comedic role Leo had on there<br />

Dude, what the hell are you smoking? Kingdom Hearts alone just blew your entire statement out of the window. Chrono Cross was a bunch of bullshit that wasn't even a real sequal anyways. Sure, the recent Final Fantasy games (FFX-2 comes to mind) isin't the best it's ever produced, but it sure isin't the WORST set of games ever produced either. Square(-Enix) are still as powerful as they were back in the 80's and 90's with RPGs.</div></div><hr />
