<br />
looks like just about every DD in the game is getting a boost, including our spears and lifetaps. <br />
as of the time of this posting, touch of innoruuk and touch of the devourer have both been upgraded, but touch of inruku has not<br />
all spears have been upgraded<br />
changes seem to be moderate boosts to dmg and mana. touch of inny is up to 510 lifetap, up from 470<br />
<br />
necro lifetaps got a good boost too... and mage nukes got huge boosts across the board, except they also got a lot of cast time increases, 1-2 seconds per spell<br />
<br />
in an interesting side note, it seems many wizard nukes had dmg and mana reduced, as well as cast times. and shock of magic was changed from 1300-3k to 2400-3k<br />
<br />
pretty interesting changes all around. wonder if dots will be tweaked next?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Most lifetaps had damage and mana increased.<br />
<br />
Touch of the Devourer has had damage increased significantly... and mana decreased.  I like.<br />
<br />
Inruku hasn't been touched- don't know if this is an oversight or what.<br />
<br />
Our level 50 quest lifetap was decreased slightly in size- but recast time was cut from 1 minute to 10 seconds, and cast time was reduced.  That's gotta be freakin sick for the level now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mikazu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spellhistory.html?id=659&amp;source=Test<br />
<br />
Conflagration was changed from 600 damage to 900 damage.<br />
<br />
There's a dagger from HS for beastlords and rangers that procs this. I think this will be a VERY nice upgrade for those classes as well. I think I might pick up ... what's it called ... Shard Flint Hilted Dagger - something like that. Anyway, I think I'll pick one up and resell it after that change comes in. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">wonder if they'll be changing some of the things that are weapon procs back specifically afterward.<br />
fabled steel hilted flint dagger would be a good toy for dual wielders to pick up for something like weaponry trial.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Silvershadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Steel Hilted Flint Dagger, and Dedgerox's Flintforged Cudgel from Barindu also procs that for some dual wielding fun. The cudgel has more classes on it also, and better ratio, so that'll be the killer... very interesting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ghismonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I noticed that Life Leech was screwed up.  Seems like devs don't play this game... yes, it's a level 49 spell and was out of sync with the scaling for it's level, but it's also quest spell.  I had Life Leech memmed over several lifetaps that came after it, but I also had to pay 3k for the spell at the time.  Is this available on a merchant now or something?<br />
<br />
Some DD had damage decreased, but recast time significantly decrease as well.  Cleric nukes, specifically.<br />
<br />
Druids had ice nukes decreased, along with mana, but had fire nukes increased.  Confusing change, considering their BPs have ice foci normally.  I wonder if heal 'balancing' is next.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>grinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Drain Soul is the interesting one for us.<br />
<br />
its now a 406pt tap for 248 mana with a 2.5 sec recast.<br />
<br />
its has almost the exact same heal/mana ratio as our lvl 70 tap but has a recast time 4 times shorter.<br />
the cast time is now 0.2 seconds slower, it should be the same when hybridy spell haste is taken into account.<br />
when those changes go live i'd say having drain sould as your main life tap would be the go, as far as healing per second.<br />
<br />
should easly get 1200pts of healing in less time then the refresh on Touch of the Devourer.<br />
<br />
so whack down with TotD then spam Drain Soul 2-3 times and back to TotD.<br />
<br />
forget the lvl 65 version unless you need the -500 resist and forget the lvl 67 version unless you dont have the lvl 70 one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rueeliar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Aye.  There are nerfs here and there hiding in the changes.  Both level 60 Wizard ice nukes were lowered significantly in damage.  Beastlord and Ranger nukes had their recasts dropped to 18s from 30s.  Druid nukes were changed to follow the trend of Wizard nukes to have higher efficiency, lower damage nukes for ice, and higher damage, lower efficiency nukes for fire.</div></div><hr />

Those are AA abilities.  They are not actual spells/songs, so they do not have a class listed.</div></div><hr />

They cut the mana cost/recast time nicely for Life Leech Ghismonda,and with Drain soul looks like low 60ish SK's will be alot better off.</div></div><hr />

<br />
740 hp in 1.5 seconds&lt;896 in 5.45 sec, espically when you consider the focus difference for most people and the fact that the 60 has no recast so as you put it you need hp now, with the 70 you get the hp every 10 sec, not exactly at will.<br />

<br />
Yes, however depending on what you're fighting the higher burst isn't going to be all that good.  Half the burst healing of a Paladin half as often isn't sufficent to make up for the loss of sustained healing, espically when you consider the fact that after 5.45 seconds of needing to tap (such as say a harder mob) Drain Soul is superior to TotD in every way outside of PvP and thats not right for a spell thats 10 levels higher.  It needs to be much higher of a burst if the potential dps/hps of it is going to stay lower than DS.  More like a Paladin heal 1/4-1/3 as often instead or even 1600ish on a 30 sec recast (a bit more healing but 1/5 as often).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>grinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">i have always though we should  get a higher burst healing ability, even if it wasn't mana effiecnt ;)</div></div><hr />

well, most people don't mind keeping two spell slots open for lifetaps, and you do get more healing using the top two than you would just using drain soul.<br />
<br />
740 in 1.5 &gt; 406 in 1.6<br />
740 + 575 (= 1315) in 5.25 &gt; 406+406 (= 812) in 5.45<br />
740 + 575 (= 1315) in 5.25 &gt; 406+406+406 (= 1218) in 9.3<br />
740 + 575 + 740 (= 2055) in 13 &gt; 406+406+406+406 = 1624 in 13.15<br />
<br />
<br />
also in real situations the top two are far better because of shorter casting time for less potential interrupts, less actual casting for less interrupts, and less casting/shorter cast times give more potential procs.<br />
but... discounting those shortcomings, in an ideal situation, drain soul would be more healing per second over a sustained period if you replace inruku with it.<br />
<br />
then you have<br />
<br />
740 in 1.5<br />
740 + 575 (= 1315) in 5.25 &gt; 740 + 406 (= 1146) in 5.35<br />
740 + 575 (= 1315) in 5.25 &lt; 740 + 406 + 406 (= 1552) in 9.2<br />
<br />
and after that ToTD would refresh.. so you'd gain 18% healing per cycle.<br />
<br />
anyway, since they missed upgrading inruku, they probably should since the version on test isn't much an upgrade from innoruuk/drain soul. it should have its dmg boosted to 620, and cut its mana to 380 to be in line.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Elkar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Why do you say a loss in potential procs?  My experience would say that casting has no effect on procs, that you actually are more likely to proc on the swing after a cast, due to pent up time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
that's a myth that has been disproved. chance to proc per round is determined solely by the haste modified delay of your weapon, casting decreases the combat rounds you have per minute, which in turn decreases your chances to proc per minute.</div></div><hr />

And you just proved my point, we need our top 2 lifetaps to beat out our level 60 lifetap for anything other than a quick burst of healing.  It shouldn't take our two best lifetaps to just about equal the strength of our level 60 one should it?</div></div><hr />

yeah. the level 60 one needs its recast increased to 10 secs too =p</div></div><hr />

I would be happy with a higher burst on all the 62+ taps.  If they aren't sufficent to make up for the lower amount of healing/min then theres no point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>grinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">because of shorter casting time for less potential interrupts, <br />
<br />
drain soul had its cast time lowered on test, it will be the same as our other taps once hybrid haste is taken into account, though i guess your sort of right in that i'll have to cast it multiple times.<br />
<br />
your right, i'll still have 2 taps up, but my second one will be drain soul and the other one will be ToD, i can get 2 maybe 3 drain souls cast while ToD refreshes.<br />
<br />
and it wont have the recast raised because its been adjusted as a necro spell.<br />
<br />
really our 62, 65, 67 and 70 taps should all have either their recast removed OR their effect doubled, IMO.<br />
<br />
necro 70 tap is 1300, 598 mana, 3.2 cast, 2.25 recast<br />
<br />
2-3 sec recast is justified for Sk's imo, not like any sk has the mana regen to chain it every fight anyway.</div></div><hr />

nope, drain soul is 3.2 sec on test, our others are 3.0 sec (which will be 1.6 with any spell haste vs 1.5 with any spell haste)<br />
<br />
i can get 2 maybe 3 drain souls cast while ToD refreshes.<br />
if you bother to look at the actual times, you'd see that its 2 at most.<br />
<br />
SKs spells are pretty nice right now, i don't understand why we need to be able to chain cast our best tap all of a sudden.<br />
<br />
why don't we focus on reasonable minor upgrades like:<br />
<br />
a 6 or 7 second recast on taps instead of 10, which would allow us to chain the best two taps basically,<br />
increasing the damage and damage:mana efficiency of inruku to something like 650 damage for 400 mana, since they missed it in the upgrades,<br />
a further minor increase in touch of the devourer's damage to something like 800 damage for 484 mana, to be slightly more in line with paladin heal upgrades,<br />
increasing the max critical heal rate by 3%, to be in line with paladins.</div></div><hr />

Cannibalize 2 used to be a long drawn out quest spell and as of this morning it is still being sold in Abysmal Sea, NPC's name is &quot;Hatem&quot;.  If you want to verify this without running out there again, you can look it up on Alakazam.  There are several posts under the shm canni2 spell that mention how it used to be quested but is now vendor sold in this zone.

the ratio remains the same, but the amount of HP becomes a lot more.  If you crit TotD then you need to crit both Soul drains to be equal, and although since you are casting twice as much you should have twice as many crits, who is to say they are going to be back to back when you need it.<br />
<br />
In a perfect world where dps coming is even and healing is even Soul Drain is better (but when is it ever even)  I think the burst healing of the higher level lifetaps doesnt come out in the base amounts, but in the total aggregate, would you rather have a chance for 3k now or 1500 now and 1500 later?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">your average healing per cast is increased the same for all spells by crits.<br />
it doesn't make any difference in the argument.<br />
<br />
if anything, its more of an argument for using drain soul, because chances of actually getting a crit are greatly increased with each cast.</div></div><hr />

With undead nukes jacked up why would one bother with the spears after patch?  I had just convinced myself to buy the 54 spear with ldon points but no way now.  Any thoughts or ideas on sony's reasoning here??</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>zarzac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">yes I realize that.  My question is that the 62 deny undead spell got a good bump.  All of our disease spears got a good bump.  However out undead syches got nerfed in their damage output.  Just wondering if you had an idea on the reasoning behind upgrading all the dd spells except the undead scythe and then actually nerfing them?  Hope this is more clear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Scythe of Innoruuk should be what scythe of Inruku is now and scythe of Inruku should be around 1200 DD.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Scythe of Innoruuk remains superior to Deny Undead because of cast time.  Recast on Deny Undead was set at the same recast as scythes.<br />
<br />
Scythe of Inruku is clearly superior to both, with a 50% damage increase over its old form and slightly better efficiency.  <br />
<br />
Memming both Scythe of Inruku and Deny Undead gives us 100 DPS against undead, vs. 67 DPS before the change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Medzgaleer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">740 hp in 1.5 seconds&lt;896 in 5.45 sec, espically when you consider the focus difference for most people and the fact that the 60 has no recast so as you put it you need hp now, with the 70 you get the hp every 10 sec, not exactly at will.<br />
<br />
A few questions,<br />
<br />
How do you account for the loss in dps during the approx 4.0 seconds since we give up a combat turn while casting.  Also I'm guessing the 5.45 sec also assumes no interuppts, fizzles, etc.   Also if we assume that sk is using lifetap procs the loss of combat turn also decreases the chances of getting heals from procs etc.<br />
<br />
The point I'm trying to make is that I think there is a bit more going on here than just pure healing power we have to consider.<br />
<br />
thanks,</div></div><hr />

<br />
you must not realize they're on the same timer. you can't cast both regardless, so scythe of innoruuk was made totally obsolete with OoW anyway.<br />
inruku got a healthy boost in its dmg:mana ratio and overall DPS.<br />
<br />
if we complain about anything, it should the downgrade to scythe of death, or unlinking innoruuk &amp; inruku, but overall its just not worth complaining about.</div></div><hr />

lifetap proc=random=not worth pointing out when you're looking at casting taps to give you a boost when you're in trouble.  The lost melee is still made up for by DS's higher dps so again that wouldn't really matter, what does however matter in what I pointed out is that its far far more healing per minute and with the exception of extremly spiky situations can be used in place of totd quite easily for better results.</div></div><hr />
