<br />
4 PvP servers and they are being ruined because of this shit and VI just say its a part of the game.  Sure, griefing and OOR healing really makes for a good gaming experience.<br />
<br />
And the whining exteamers say &quot;why aren't you my friend any more?&quot;.  Simple, I'm here to kill dumb fucks like you not sit next to you in some peaceful co-existance that makes absolutely no sense for an RPG.<br />
<br />
See wood elf.  Kill wood elf.  Things were simple in the beginning.  Now its see wood elf, beat wood elf, then think what the fuck is going on when some dark elf cleric heals the woods elf instead of the dark elf whos on his team.<br />
<br />
Dumb shits, go play blue.</div></div><hr />

Admit it big man, your too scared to go blue because you know that you'll be proved to be a lameass and your not at all l33t like you wanna be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Everyone would stay level 1?  Odd, I'm level 50 and I'm in a dark only guild.  I don't have trouble levelling, I dont have trouble pking.  I just dont understand why you people are intent on trying to do something that the server wasnt meant for when there are lots of other servers to go and do exactly that thing on.  And I'm dumb, fuck.</div></div><hr />

Lejina, I only got my colors fucked up because he did in that line. <br />
<br />
The bottom line nenadar, is that some people, like myself enjoy playing PvP, but also like to enjoy other aspects of the game at times. This can be hard because hardcore PKers like you run around and kill us while we are medding and send us tells like &quot; I just pwned you LOL L&amp;S noob&quot;.  What do we do to help protect us from that? We start Xteam guilds because there is safety in numbers as well as invulnerable healers. I suspect you probably just got your assed handed to you by Xteamers and decided to cry about it. Well guess what? There aint shit you can do about it, and there will never be shit you can do about it, so shut the fuck up and go play quake already you lame ass script kitty.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you want to med in safety, go play on a blue server.  Simple.<br />
<br />
I'm almost as bright as you then eh, claiming to be blue when your playing on a red server.  Your totally lost.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or I can stay on my red server and Xteam. Its even funner now that I can listen to you cry about it.  You can sit here and make nasty posts all day, but Xteamers will still be there when you are done. man, sucks to be you doesnt it? Like I said, go play quake. <br />

The teams just restrict who you can kill.  It doenst mean you cant group or guild with members of other teams. Sorry you want it to be that way, maybe you should try the roleplaying server, or like I said earlier sullon zek. Even better yet you can just keep crying.</div></div><hr />

I tried the other Zeks and have friends on the other Zeks, but the crossteaming bullshit got to be just way too much.  On Sullon Zek you're united by the gods your team worships, which makes good sense.<br />
<br />
Oh, and just FYI, while evil does have a large number of players, there are plenty of high level good and neutral players on the server as well.  Just last night a level 62 Vah Shir Beastlord terrorized Field of Bone for an hour or so and there wasn't much anyone could do against the guy because the evil high levels were all in some PoP zone.  So it's not exactly a cakewalk.</div></div><hr />

Never understood EQ pvp.   <br />
<br />
Never understood EQ pve only.<br />
<br />
PvP for me is a rush of adrenaline I just dont get doing anything PvE. Without it I would have quit EQ long ago.<br />
Dont get me wrong its not that I like pvp 24/7, but having the choice of &quot;what to do today&quot; or the constant alertness you need to have while pve'ing is great. <br />
I dont agree with the above posts saying that random ubr twink pkayers destroy the game or fun of it. If it happens just play smart. Theres many ways to deal with that kind of thing. Pick the right zones to hunt in, learn evasive tricks, leave to other zones (heck see the world) or just practice practice practice so that one day you will beat em.<br />
I see over and over again how one &quot;prepared&quot; pk'er can wipe a minor group that just didnt see it coming. In the name of Rallos Zek they deserved death, weaklings! Be ready for that sort of thing! Whats that, u didn't have resist cold and endure disease on, omg! What kind of SK are you, they should be on 24/7 if your serious about being on this server. Oh I see u went for stats in your gear lineup instead of resists, well death is coming your way, might as well begin to whine now. Hmmmm, why are you using that 1hs/hb/piercing in pvp, didnt you read the excelent posts in the &quot;Combat and tactics&quot; topic about how to pvp (especially by Ciliz Scalebladez)? Holy shit, dont tell me u waste mana on thats useless spell in pvp, and u dont have shadow memmed omg?? <br />
I could go on and on with this list, but I guess what im trying to say that if ur not ready for it dont expect to live. Ive played this sk's fer a long time now (way too long :) ) and almost never have I had any real problems with pk'ers (im a pk'er myself from time to time). Either they beat me because they got the lvls on me, in which case I smile bout it and move on. Or maybe just because they are plain better than me in which case I gratz em on kill well done, we chat, I loot, I move on, case closed.<br />
<br />
Bottom line: YOU DECIDE YOU OWN FAITH. And if your god is Rallos Zek then you decide not to be the weaker.<br />

Could someone explain 'x-teaming'? I only have a vague idea of what it means.  <br />
<br />
On Tallon and Vallon there are 4 teams.  These teams are regular blue to each other (can't stun, AoEs won't hit, can't melee), and other teams are like mobs (can stun, AoE, melee, etc.) - the teams are blind, elf, dark and short.<br />
<br />
Because of teaming rules, if you are a high elf enchanter grouped with a ogre SK (on a different team) and a wood elf ranger (same team), and you stun, the ogre will make a resist check and could be stunned, but the ranger will get &quot;enchanter tries to cast on you but you are immune&quot; message.<br />
<br />
In the same way, if a dark elf SK decides to go to Kelethin and kill everyone, and he has a high elf cleric following him around, that cleric can heal him, but no one who is an elf can do anything about the cleric the cleric since the cleric is on the elf team (a dwarf or gnome could though). That's cross teaming.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thumbs up to PvP and the red servers. The population of annoying l33t d00ds would be so higher on the regular servers without them.<br />
<br />
Now, if they could stick to their servers and forums and never make themselves heard to the other players, that would be even better. Face it zekkers, the bluebies dont give a flying fuck about you, your servers, the PvP balance and your supah l33t PvP sk33ls. If you really want to talk about it, then stick to Sullon's Tavern or whatever is the name of PvP forums, maybe there someone will care about your inputs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I also think PvP in EQ is a waste of time but please tell me you're kidding when you say the PvE game takes years to master. You learn 99% of it when you locate the auto attack key. I feel bad for the zekers because PvP can be a lot of fun when done right. <br />
<br />
If they are going to have 4 PvP servers they should at least dedicate some time to making it work right. Instead they seem content to offer half ass changes that don't really fix any of the key problems. Then they have the nerve to complain that the servers are under populated. <br />
<br />
If they bothered to start from scratch and make the spells/skills/gear balanced they would probably see a lot more people like me interested. As it stands I'm not going to waste my time being frustrated.</div></div><hr />

My RL friend got me into EQ about a year ago, and he played on Tallon Zek. Of course I wanted to be on the same server as him, so I join while I'm a complete fuckin' newb. He was a 40 something monk at the time, and he refused to give me any gear to get me started. I think the only thing he ever got me was a Dwarven ringmail tunic at level 10 (omfg uber.) Anyway I can remember running around on my dwarven warrior (level 10) with a few friends, when all of a sudden some dark elf would pop out and start murdering us. We would flee in terror and try to regroup, and I just remember all the chaos of being a newb was more fun than anything I've since done.<br />

I think if you read my posts you'll know I still pk a lot. Hell, I do it more than I level. It's just nice to not always have to be getting xp, or camping an item, or killing mobs for faction.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jupke</div><div class="date">01-29-2003, 05:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My first char was on the Team-pvp servers when they were still uber with item and coin loot. Teams ment something seeing some human ranger came into nektulos forest PKing newbies for fun and seeing about 10-15 DE's gangbang that ranger for trespassing was the best.<br />
Then itemloot got removed, twinks started, fun stopped.<br />
So i play on blue server now and i dont regret it. Things got fucked on PvP-team and are still fucked with twinks. Unless the diety server has an item loot rule.</div></div><hr />

You learn 99% of it when you locate the auto attack key. I feel bad for the zekers because PvP can be a lot of fun when done right.  <br />
<br />
Walil, you think hitting auto attack is mastering the game?  I didnt say it takes years to learn how to play, I said it takes years to MASTER.  There are lvl 65 players who havent mastered the game yet.</div></div><hr />

You know what started x-teaming?<br />
SOE not hardcoding VZ/TZ. Anything else posted about the team servers and how unfair xteaming is, is just noise.</div></div><hr />
