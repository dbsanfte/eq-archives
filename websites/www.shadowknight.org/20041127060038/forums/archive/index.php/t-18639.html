<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Maujin Buu'jin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I remember fear kitting in OT at about 35 and it was time consuming( a long while back).  At lvl 26 i hunted in SK fear kitting aviaks and the occational gnoll.  Come to think if it with my cleric (poorly equiped) i played in Echo Caverns at lvl 25ish (Fungus grove side).  Dont know how well you could solo one of the Bandit camps in PC, but i believe Ive seen other classes solo there.<br />
<br />
just some random input, hope it helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Satist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i left PC at 26, having solo'd there from 16 on...  at 26, i was taking the 2 spawns on the outside of camp 2, as well as (if you are facing the camp, with the water at your back)  the 2 huts on the right side (you could prolly do the 2 huts on the left side as easily).  I left PC because  the mobs were beginning to go LB, but, it was still pretty good xp.  I stayed there until  was 20% into 26, then left for greener pastures.  I wound up setting up shop in SK.  I tried Neth Lair, but very quickly grew tired of running any adds to the guards ( if you get one add, odds are you'ree getting more).  I also tried  MS, and the xp is about the same as SK, but the mobs in MS hit harder, and have more hp.  In SK (at the spires), I'm getting about 2% per kill on blues, with whites and yellows being    a bit more ( 2.5 and 3% respectively)  and, since I'm a troll, I figure that I'm doing quite well, because of the racial penalty.  I figure that the non penalized races would be getting 3% to 4% per kill at 26.  I fearkite yellows, and I also fearkite the gnolls that have the gnollhide lariat (rather obvious that they have it equiped)  because of the stun proc, which seems to last longer than the normal Bash, you're stunned...  (speaking of which, don't bother giving your pet the lariat, he's not high enough til the level 49 pet to proc the weapon).   The gnolls also drop FS weapons, which is a nice bonus, considering they don't drop much cash .  I just give bonehead the first FS 2hander that drops, and  save a 2hander for the next time i log on,  Another bonus is...  even as a troll of Cazic, or an Iksar (partnered with an Ikky shaman) you can sell at the centaur outpost there, which means not having to lug your  loot  to PoK or  Lake Rathe to sell....Anywho, spawn time is somewhere around 18 minutes, and I usually have 2-3 that I do in a circuit before the next respawn.  You can also suck down any green birds, lions, or elephant calves you see, to shorten the downtime for regening.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ciliss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I just finished hunting in Ferrott at lvl 28.  What I did was go to the bridge where there are 2 tae ew lizards at the other end. I would pull those 2 and then there were 2 standing near there after you cross the bridge.  I hunted the straglers also. Went from 25 to 28 in 2 evenings of playing. They drop up to a couple of pp and also drop fine steel.  Was able to max 2 weapon skills and get a good way into a third while doing this.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gaklaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">solo guards in HK and maybe giants in WW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I also did entrance of SolA at 26, tough but sick exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Darcloakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I like to solo from 25-35 in unrest.  Just dont go in the basement to solo, hags can nuke for 300.  The downside is that if your not carefull you will have a huge train on your ass and if the ghouls root you, your SOL and cant zone.  The xp is good though.</div></div><hr />
