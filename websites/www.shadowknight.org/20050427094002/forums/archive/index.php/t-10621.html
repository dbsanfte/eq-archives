<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jgolob</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have read that large races slam works with bash.  Can someone please explain to me what that means?  <br />
<br />
<br />
My understanding is as follow:<br />
Bash goes up with skill and with the higher skill does more damage.  Slam on the other hand from playing large races before never went up in skill.  It did 1 point of damage and had a chance to stun.  <br />
<br />
But let me see if I am understanding what I have read so far:  With large race SK, their slam goes up with bash meaning that they can bash without a shield.  Therefore, they can increase their bash skill by clicking on slam, thus making the slam do more then 1 point of damage and stunning the mob.  Is this correct or not?<br />
<br />
If this is correct, then why does no one mention it when comparing the races.  To me this would be a huge advantage over the other races.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Stwongbad Soulkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Basically, when ogres/trolls get the Bash ability, your Slam will act as a Bash, as though you had a shield equipped, even if you don't.  I hope that makes sense.  Yes, the dmg will go up, and it still has a chance to stun the mob.  Nice ability to have for that little extra DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>jbullions</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I don't know what has changed since I left 2 years ago but Slam and Bash both have the same function (stun for a second and disrupt spellcasting) but 2 different skill progressions. So if you click on Slam, you don't get points for Bash. Bash is a skill using a Shield. Slam is a separate skill with or without a shield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lejina Bloodbath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Slam act as a 5/60 off hand weapon<br />
<br />
Bash act as a *ac of your shield, up to 25*/60 off hand weapon.<br />
<br />
So, if you use a Sarnak Battle Shield (ac 25) it will act as a 25/60 weapon when you will use bash.<br />
<br />
Bash/Slam also have the ability to interrupt casters up to lvl 55.<br />
<br />
Bash and Slam both use the same skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Edit: Well, Lejina beat me to it, and as usual, did a better job at explaining exactly how it works without muddling the issue.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't know what has changed since I left 2 years ago but Slam and Bash both have the same function (stun for a second and disrupt spellcasting) but 2 different skill progressions. So if you click on Slam, you don't get points for Bash. Bash is a skill using a Shield. Slam is a separate skill with or without a shield. <br />
<br />
Totally and completely incorrect.  Slam is simply a racial version of Bash Skill which does not require a shield to be equipped.  In other words:<br />
<br />
I hit the slam button.  The combat readout is something like, &quot;You bashed MOB_001 for 19 points of damage!&quot;<br />
<br />
I equip a shield, hit the slam button. The combat readout is something like, &quot;You bashed MOB_001 for 29 points of damage!&quot;<br />
<br />
The slam button will activate a &quot;bash&quot; if a large race has a shield equipped.  Due to some of the bash changes with shields, an actual shield bash does more damage than a slam, slightly.  This is not, however, due to the skill progression.  It is simply because they coded it to make shields give a damage modifyer to bash skill.<br />
<br />
When you are using slam, skill in bash goes up, but you have to train a single point in the skill, IIRC.<br />
<br />
I've done some asking around in the past, and I know that large race shamen are not able to increase their slam skill beyond 1 damage.  I'm not sure about warrior class, as the only Troll warrior I know never bought a shield (he also didn't play very far on that toon).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>jbullions</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well I'm not totally and completely wrong. I know Slam is a racial skill for Large races, and I know both can be used to stun mobs and disrupt spellcasting. <br />
<br />
I did not know however that both Slam and Bash are the same skill. Meaning, if you put on a shield, the Slam becomes Bash. The class needs to have a Bash skill in order for them to receive the dmg bonuses, correct? I guess this could explain why Large race Shamans can only do 1 damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dakkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think I see what the confusion is here.<br />
<br />
If you play a large race, you get Slam as a racial ability, but if you're a shaman or rogue it's capped at a very low level and the skill will never go up.<br />
<br />
For tanks it just lets you use your bash skill to stun / interrupt / boost aggro as though you had a shield equipped, but with less damage.</div></div><hr />
