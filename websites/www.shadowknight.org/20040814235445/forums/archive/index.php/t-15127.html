<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zeixxs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was recently advised to look into acquiring some draconic pauldrons, <br />
but i have NEVER hunted in Velious for very long and my faction is at it was when velious was released.<br />
My guild does some kael raids and i want to join (i could definatly use a good BP).<br />
<br />
Ok, my questions:<br />
 how do u raise faction with the dwarfs enough to get the BP ?<br />
<br />
After that, how do u raise the CoV faction to kindly to get the draconic pauldrons ?<br />
<br />
i m sure there is some questing involved and maybe some hunting, just need some clues about it<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The short answer is kill Giants.  Lots of giants.  You'll get a CoV and a Thurgadin faction hit for every giant you kill, if I'm not mistaken (to be honest, I've not payed much attention to the faction hits hunting inside Kael).  I do know that for every giant I've killed in EW and GD, there has been a CoV and Thurg positive hit.<br />
<br />
You can also do some quests that will raise your faction with one or the other.  Mostly they involve turning in giant toes and heads, helms and beards.  Check www.allakhazam.com for more information on the faction quests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zeixxs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I did not think u could raise 2 factions at the same time, well if its THAT simple...<br />
thanks i ll try that</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">For raising Coldain faction: once you get out of KOS, doing the ring quests raises faction pretty fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kizzestra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">IMO, put up Word of Spirit, get a wiz and chanter buddy and run around GD aggroing every giant and drakkel dire wolf (not coldain tracking wolves), lure them to one spot and AE them into oblivion. It will take quite a few hours of this if you are good about it, more if you are lame with AE. This raises your faction with the dwarves and dragons and lowers your faction with frost and storm giants.<br />
<br />
Best O' luck to ye.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Dear god, Word of Spirit would take forever to kill the giants.  The wolves go down pretty easily, but shit, the giants have some hp, even the greenies in GD/EW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think he's saying use Word of Spirit to gain faction, and use the wizard to kill 'em.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think it's just as fast to kill 'em yourself.  I got a pet up and ran up to every giant and wolf I could find...  it took about 20 sec to kill each.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Valkyria Grymreaper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Zeixxs you are lvl 55. This is a no-brainer.<br />
<br />
Go to kael and kill giants. Lots of giants. Keep killing giants.<br />
<br />
Eventually you will be max ally CoV and Thurg, prolly with some good plate armor from the quests to boot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I maxed both CoV and Thurg killing the greenies at the door and over the bridge in kael.   Ive noticed a lot of people DO group there for faction hits and sometimes people will let you tag vindi for that hit also.   Just hit kael as much as you can and watch for weekend raids, i just killed everything in sight and tagged as many mobs as possible while people around me were killing also.  Maxed both in a few days.</div></div><hr />
