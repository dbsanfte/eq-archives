<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nozgoth D'Burzum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm having serious problems with my cable connection, when playing EQ I go link dead every 15 to 20 min so it makes playing really really pointless. I'm running my cable internet through a router then to my PC. EQ will run fine when the cable is connected directly to my PC but the router seems to be what's causing the issue. I would just run the cable strait into my machine more often but I live with 3 other roommates that use the net pretty heavily.<br />
<br />
if anyone has had a similar problem and has the solution I will send you $50 I swear to god, that's how bad I want to fix this shite.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Open up the HTTP config screen.  (Point browser to 192.168.1.1.  username admin, password admin unless you've changed it.)<br />
<br />
Advanced Tab -&gt; Forwarding Tab -&gt; Port Triggering<br />
<br />
Enter...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nozgoth D'Burzum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">if this works i will send you 50 bones im not shiting you!! thank you so much</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Requiam O'Souls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have the same problem using my linksys. Talking to tech support (I'm not  a techie, so take it for what it's worth), they suggested to unplug the router for 30 seconds, then plug it back in.<br />
<br />
Apparently the IP address gets lost, and needs to re-new it. Works fine for me, though what he suggested will probrably have more permanent affects. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nozgoth D'Burzum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">so far iv been logged in for over 30 min which is extreamly unusual, so i think the advice Krazaak gave is truely working! this is like my fucking birthday. im so god damn thrilled thanks again!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Requiam O'Souls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Where's the http config option if I may ask?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Krazaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The router is configured using your browser from any PC behind it.<br />
<br />
With a default installation, if you open Internet Explorer (or whatever) and enter http://192.168.1.1 it will bring you to the configuration tool.<br />
<br />
Username : admin<br />
Password : admin<br />
<br />
There you can configure a great deal of settings.  The port triggering info above should be all you need to play EQ without the constant LDs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nozgoth D'Burzum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">well its working for sure, i stayed logged in the bazaar all night last night. its kinda funny how the people at sony told me there was nothing they could do about this problem, yet i was able to fix it in a matter of seconds.<br />
<br />
thoses lazy fucks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Warmaster Xsavuung Llaahh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ironically, my switch started acting up just after I read this post. I have been able to stay online for as long as 1.5 hours, but inevitably, I go LD.<br />
<br />
I put in the Port triggering you suggested, but it doesn't seem toi change anything. I also looked up the firmware upgrade, but it's corrupted and has known problems, anyway.<br />
<br />
I read on the FAQ part of the linksys webpage that you need to open the port 27960 if you play online games. Is this my problem? I can't figure out how to open the port to find out. <br />
<br />
Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>GenoReaper999</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">will the port trigger config work with dial up too?<br />
:confused: <br />
i have an ethernet modem hooked up on dial up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Requiam O'Souls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It seems to be for linksys, so if you have a linksys it should be workable. At least I would think so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zakton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">No this is not a fix for an external modem using dial up.  Mostly likely if you are getting dropped every 30 mins by your ISP its cause you are staying connected for more than 12 hours at a time.  Once you do that you go on the naughty list and they try to kill your connection every 30 mins in the hope that you aren't actively using it (ie you are away while downloading a big file as opposed to sitting there playing EQ).   You can get off the naughty list by just staying off your connection for a day or at least break up a long playing session with a hour break or something.    Too bad unlimited internet access isn't really unlimited.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>GenoReaper999</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I share my comp with my cousin and roommate. when im asleep, my cous is on, and when im at school my roomate is on.  my comp is almost never off, or offline for that matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zakton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yeah your on the naughty list then. They want to free up that modem for anyone else that might be trying to dial up. I would get cable or DSL but they don't offer in my area at the moment.  I am gonna move next time the lease is up just because of that fact.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Lindyile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Update your firmware.  There have been a few different firmware versions from linksys.  The newest version is fine.  Out of the box my befsr11 had a janky firmware.  Updated it and fixed.  I recieved this router like beginning of april.<br />
<br />
I used the same router at my parents house before I moved out too.  Updated my firmware once and was getting disconnected about every 15min.  That version of firmware resets the router every 15min...donno why anyone would want that.  I had to grab an older firmware version to fix it.<br />
<br />
But yea, the newest firmware version is fine.</div></div><hr />
