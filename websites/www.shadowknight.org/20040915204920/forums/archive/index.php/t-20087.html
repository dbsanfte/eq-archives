<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lagwagon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So im trien to farm both the abrogation blade and the ghoulbane.. spent countless hours trien to farm ghoulbane and then i tried the quest.. The parchment off the crazed goblin apears to be just as rare as the ghoulbane off the shin lord. as for the abrogation blade can that drop off ANYTHING? or are there specific mobs? (i swere this is karma for me getting my decrepit hide the first 30 seconds in hate)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Laymon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Blade of Abrogation can drop off A Thunder Spirit Princess, <br />
An Essence Tamer, Gorgalosk or The Spiroc Lord.<br />
<br />
The Shin Lord will pop with the sword eventually. it's a long camp but better than several long camps doing it the quest way.<br />
<br />
You're not going to win any friends round here by telling people you got your hide within 30 seconds of entering hate<br />
<br />
Grats anyway :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lagwagon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yeah i know but man i was so surprised and happy at the same time.. Meanwhile my whole guild at the time was trien to convince me to delete it lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Uggliey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">For the Ghouldbane, the quest is much much faster than camping the frog.  Just keep asking the noobies hunting in high pass keep to let you loot it if it drops, and maybe help them by taunting mobs for them or saving them from over pulls heh.  They will love it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ravenar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I would have to disagree with saying quest is faster.  Each and every time I help, show them where it is, people camp the shin lord, they have it less than two hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gargar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I beleive i got the shaft then...    Camped that bastard for almost 40 hours total before I got my Ghoulbane.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kenshi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Did the quest for the ghoul bane in about 45 min. Druid friend helped by porting me from place to place. Went to LGuk later to get the scalp off the lord for the wood elf crown. camped him for about 8 hours and have yet to see a ghoulbane drop. would have to agree that the quest is alot faster. your mileage may vary thou.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nafien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I did the quest for the ghoulbane - in HHK there are 3 spawns that can drop the parchment, one in the look out room, another in the left corner of the main room across from the stairway, and one down the ramp towards the higher level pickclaw area.<br />
<br />
It took about 60 mins for me to get the quest drop cycling all 3.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dester</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I did the quest for the ghoul bane in about 5 -6 hrs from start to finish. (This was Pre PoP so I had lots of running to do as well as waiting on luclin spires).  and was mid 30s at the time.<br />
<br />
The HHK piece is easy cuz the gobbos are perma camped.  Najena piece was easy, any skelly that is the 20+ level can drop it... think it took me like 2 cycles and I see it every 2 -3 cycles when I PL twinks though there.<br />
<br />
The BB piece actually took the longest, haveing to clear them for about an hr or so before I got it.<br />
<br />
So the quest can be shorter or longer, Just depends on your luck with the frog of droping it.  But all the quest pieces are much more common.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Covi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The quest is easier than the camp...usually some noobs /ooc'ing about the parts dropped and more than likely willing to let ya loot it.</div></div><hr />
