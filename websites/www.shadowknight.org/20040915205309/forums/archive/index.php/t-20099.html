<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Soltisce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ok i recently got this AA at lvl 62. i wanted some eye candy so i skipped some more useful AA and got ToL. now ive been casting ALOT of lifetaps, chain casted ToV on a Sont raid yesterday with no crit heal, thats about 20 lifetaps alone prolly more. my question is. will ToL alone get you the exeptional heal, or do you have to have SCF as well?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mdiyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">To answer your question no, once you get ZB, you will probably see a lot more exceptional heals when grouping.  SCF is nice for when you do a crit blast with say ToV for 940 and get an 1880 heal.  I don't think it is a static % of the number of cast done by a healing spell.  Just more of a random cast will yield you an exceptional heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Soltisce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i have ZB as well. used that a ton and have yet to see one.</div></div><hr />

Got what level of ToL?  If I remember right, ToL1 wasn't that large of a chance to crit.<br />
<br />
But no, you do not need SCF to crit heal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since when does ToV crit for 940? Your thinking of ToI....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nambkab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I personally bought ToL1 and 2 basically right after another, and for the longest time had ToL2.  To this day, it is still one of the most fun AA I've gotten, and has saved my life on many occassions.  I now have ToL3, and though I still have runs with no or few exceptional heals, I typically roll them in on a regular basis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Soltisce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">last nite i started gettin tons of heals with ZB. i had some shots where it exceptionaly healed twice off one cast. the only thing that ws different was i had NDT, so my DEX was capped. /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>NorrynNoir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">are you sure the exceptional heals you were seeing weren't off shroud of chaos? those would come more frequently with max dexterity. also consider that if NDT was first in your buff line then you could have been getting ToL's off of its lifetap. if you have a lot of spam going to your window sometimes it's hard to see exactly what caused the heal especially since it can happen anytime on the proc stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Awaon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Not sure if it's what you're asking exactly, but you do get exceptional heals from ZB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">ToL 1 is a very low chance to crit.  IIRC it goes to 10% at level 3.  Level 1 is a bit of eye candy with ZB, that's about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Saruton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I cant second Joshad'S opinion. I have ToL 1 only so far and i have constant and lots of crits. Though those are felt crits and not actually parsed crits, but i am fine with the amount of crits i get from ToL 1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tirnan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I too regularly see exceptional heals off zb with just ToL 1.  And yes on an oddball occasion you will see more than one crit heal in the same cast (on different group members).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mdiyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Blah, I stand corrected you are right, it was ToI</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Vaiyo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">(sorry about bumping an old topic up)<br />
<br />
Has anyone gained so much HP from a ToI crit + ToL that they actually got aggro'd from that?  Like, is it possible to be doing good during a raid keeping my aggro down and all of a sudden I kill myself because I overaggro'd with a overly huge crit?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>strag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">no</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>ZilshasisEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">In this day and age your warrior MT has to suck royally to loose aggro on raids. Between decent damage, Anger procs, Enraging Blow and Incite it just doesn't happen all that often.<br />
<br />
So don't worry about it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Soltisce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">nope you dont get any extra aggro from Crits. if that was the case Wizzies would die ALOT more often.</div></div><hr />
