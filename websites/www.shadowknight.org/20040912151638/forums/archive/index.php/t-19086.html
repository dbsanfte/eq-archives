<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>AkumaShreddies</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a 53 SK and normally pull with darkness line. I was told by my guild that it is much better to pull with bow than spells as it causes less agro.<br />
This bringas me to my problem. I have an archery skill of 35ish and have fletching up around 130ish. What is the fastest way to increase archery with least down time. I have been trying to increase it by sitting next to a group and hitting their mobs(well missing most of the time) and they don't care, because they get xp, loot. Is this the best way to do it?<br />
<br />
TIA</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Menon Lifeblight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There is no reason to raise your archery skill.<br />
<br />
It's a pulling tool only, and you can pull with misses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cazite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Archery for SK's caps at 70 I believe so it really doesn't matter.  As for pulling, I prefer using Abduction of Strength for 2 reasons:<br />
<br />
1)  It costs a measly 5 mana <br />
2)  Debuff spells allow you to pull any level mob w/o causing them to summon.  Mobs will only summon if you have done dmg to them, or they have done dmg to you.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't worry about archery.</div></div><hr />

<br />
a) Archery is not a tradeskill, and anything you put in it would be a waste yes.<br />
b) There is no such thing as a &quot;best&quot; tradeskill for a SK, it all depends on what you skill you need for what you want to do. <br />
<br />
That said, smithing can be nice to have sometimes (Seru bane and stuff).</div></div><hr />

MTPs are  cheap for how goothey are and simple too<br />
just 3000 clicks eack, but the components are easy.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>belize</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">if you some day want to get the uber quest tradeskill earring, then no fletching is not a waste, that quest requires you to max out every single tradeskill. <br />
<br />
otherwise, i see baking, and possibly smithing as useful. i am in a large guild and just get others to combine things for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Thingiemethong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">But there is nothing wrong with showing of your nice bow (http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=29597) just for pulling and tell your Ranja's in your guild it hits for shit .. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Goregan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">to actualy raise your archery skill just ask/pay some ranger with tolan bracer to summon you shitloads of arrows then when maxed if you intend to use your bow to pull just make cheapest arrows you can with a half decent range on them.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Your bow will skill up as ya pull.... it doesn't really matter what your skill is anyways, it's not a damage tool, and you can get aggro on a miss for pulling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Khall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Sk cap is 75 I believe, AKA you can't hit a barn at 25 feet. <br />
<br />
If you don't want alot of aggro when pulling with spells, use the low level Spear or abduction of strenght. Any good tank can easily pull aggro off that , especially if its another SK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Vengyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Easiest and quickest way to skill up your archery? At the start of every guild raid, ask one of your mages for a few stacks of arrows. When the named mob is engaged, &quot;blend&quot; into the crowd and try to look like a Gar as you start shooting. Don't try this for more than 2 or 3 stacks, or your guildies will start gettin suspicious why you are doin feck all damage. Maxed my archery skill doin this pretty fast, and my guildies never realised why on some raids my DPS was pretty close to zero.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Nastard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Empty out your bags, go to East Karana, fill them with arrows from the merchants in the area, fear kite Tarbul until he's 5% health, then proceed to fire a thousand arrows up his arse. His natural regen will probably be more than the damage you'd do with arrows, so every once in a while throw a spear to keep him from getting too healthy. He's also good practice for getting any weapon skill up. Sometimes he'll flee up the path leading to High Keep and get stuck against the wall, and with a weapon with the perfect damage (something like a fine steel weapon), you can auto-attack/afk and his regen will match your DPS. One bored afternoon I actually maxed H2H against him heheh. What a delicious waste of time.</div></div><hr />

depends on your race...Keevel is a descent tailor because that's his cultural<br />
<br />
Smithing is good but not cheap (totally worth it if your cultural is smithing though)<br />
<br />
Fletching is cheap and useful, heck might make yerself a bow some far off day<br />
<br />
Both Baking and brewing can get you stat food/stuff, but get metabolism AA's to make the consumption of that cheaper.  Baking is super cheap and so is brewing if you do the skull ale thing.<br />
<br />
I can't think of other tradeskills (besides the damn tinkering gnomes) that an SK will really use much besides just to have neat toys.</div></div><hr />

Since you're a gnome work on tinkering since you're cultural armor is made by tinkering.   It's a huge (as in biblical proportions) money sink, but you get descent stuff, and it has a very unusual look and  effects that no one else gets on thier cultural.    Also if you like it and become a GM tinkerer, you can prolly make money off of it making it for others or impress hot little gnome babes by making them some haste sleeves for valentines day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Dralien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Pulling with a bow is safer,<br />
<br />
You don't have to wait 1 or 2sec for your spells to pop back and can FD right away. However sometimes its a pain when the mob is close to a wall. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Hilde Guaard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">with a Bloody Ancille's Pouch you can summon your own arrows. you just need a Purified Crystal (4,5 gp by magus) to summon 20 arrows. <br />
<br />
that means with 4 stacks Purified Crystals (32 pp) in you inventar, you are able to summon 1600 arrows :D <br />
<br />
Bloody Ancille's Pouch is a 7k item on ay'ro.</div></div><hr />
