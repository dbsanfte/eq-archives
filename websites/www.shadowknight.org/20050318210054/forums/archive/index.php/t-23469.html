Reading through the walkthrough it cuts off at going to talk to lhranc.  I am at the moment in the proccess of finding his items, then I plan on going to visit slayer and find out about lhranc myself.  Have we made more progress then this?

once again , epic 2.0 supposed to be really short , u need  a '' stone of discordant energy'' to  talk with filigno the slayer , and supposely start the lhranc fight.<br />
<br />
Only problem is that stone is dropped in anguish , and prolly from mata'muram itself ( or warden ) , also Anguish been beefed up as it was very easy, slowing down the  progression.<br />
<br />
Dunno how much further epic 2.0 will go ( but i think it will stop there ,as necro just need that same pieces we need to finish theirs as well ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I wouldn't be surprised if epic 2.0 is really short but requires you to get something extremely tough from Anguish.  Basically you've done the long quest to epic yourself by getting 1.5, then to get 2.0 you just need to drop the biggest badasses in Anguish and do a couple other relatively easy things and BAM you're epic'd.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shredler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I suspect it will end in COA but we will end up with ultra tough mobs, it is not that hard to tell. But first things first, noone's getting into COA before doing the trials and collecting the signets :) So we'll have to work hard. I got 2 trials down 4 left. With this progression speed i think it'll take a couple of months before i can get my hands on epic 2.0.</div></div><hr />

I believe Siilver and Brael are already in Anguish. And if they are I would venture a good many other guilds are as well (meaning tops on each server of course).</div></div><hr />
