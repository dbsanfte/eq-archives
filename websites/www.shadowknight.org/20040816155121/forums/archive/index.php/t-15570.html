<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zvaras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So I spent the last two nights running about killing frogs.  I picked up 8 lore pages and 1 non-lore one.  I thought I was done.  Run back to Lord Gizik, hail him and run through the text only to have him give try and give me a lore page which I already had in my possession.<br />
<br />
I identified the 9 I had and I have #1 through 9.  My question is does he always hand out the same number page?  If so which one?  If he hands out the same numbered page why is it that page is dropping of the raiders?  Ugh... I've done both stints late at night and my mind must not be working because I'm missing something here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Saruton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Dont you need a binder from the frogloks too ? Too long ago here. Look it up in the quest section.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zvaras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I did get a binder.  So far from the frogs its 8 lore pages, 1 non lore, and the binder... for some reason the page Lord G wants to give me is the same as one of the ones I have.  <br />
<br />
If I have one left to get from the frogs does that mean all 10 pages are obtainable from the frogs?<br />
<br />
/boggle<br />
<br />
I have read the quest section, what it says and what I'm seeing isn't adding up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zenobie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The page that Lord G gives you is No DROP, the pages you find on the raiders are tradable. You can maybe verify this : do you have similar pages but one NO DROP and one tradable ? <br />
<br />
If he gives you the same as one you already have, it has to be the non lore one... Very weird. I can only see that you arleady hailed Lord G before hunting the raiders, but you don't remember. Keep killing Raiders until you find the last page.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jodgrim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Did you read any of them?<br />
<br />
When you start the quest he gives you the first page and tells you to find the binder and the other 9 pages. He also tells you not ot read the pages as they will fill your mind with madness. I don't know if it has any effect on the useability of the pages, but you can bet that I didn't read them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Saruton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">They aren't readable afair, and as Zenobie said, just go and get that last page from the frogs, should solve your riddle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Note also that the last page seems to take three times as long as any other page you got.  Probably, there isn't a single page that is more rare than any other, but it just feels that way because you've not had to pick up a single specific random page.<br />
<br />
This part of the quest took me four or five days to complete, even with help, so don't get disgusted if it takes you a while.  You'll eventually get it, and it's good practice in patience for the Dalnir and Goblin Jail parts, which can be trying on your sanity as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zvaras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks for the ideas and replies.  I'll double check my bank incase I have the given note there.  I did the first blade some 40+ levels ago and then set it aside.  Its possible I did the trigger to begin the 2nd blade and then put the page aside.  That sure would be nice... rather feel foolish for that then going back to hunt more raiders.  Every time I get one of those &quot;Duplicate Lore&quot; messages I cringe!<br />
<br />
Not sure what's worse, mind numbing camp quest or mind numbing tradeskill quest.</div></div><hr />
