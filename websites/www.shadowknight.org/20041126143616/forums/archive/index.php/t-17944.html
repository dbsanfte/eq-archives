<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Seinharu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've lvled a few toons over 50, so I know pretty well how to get there. And Ldon is pretty nice (wish the grps stayed together longer) but anway this is how ive lvled my Sk so far..<br />
<br />
1-4 Nektulious Forest (Hometown newb area) <br />
4-6 Clan Brushbone (If you Don't wanna ruin ur  De faction because ur a DE Only do 2-4 lvls here so you dont dmg your faction to much)<br />
6-12 Shadeweavers Thicket side of Paulidal Cavrens. (Kill the shrooms the bugs help each other, after lvl 8 look for Juvis and if u are partnering with someone you can stay on this side with phlargs till lvl 15 or so actully)<br />
<br />
12-15 HallowShade moor side or PC ( you can stay here til 17 on pheinds if u really cant get going on bandits) <br />
<br />
15-23 Shadowheaven side of PC (kill the phlargs if you cant get a proper bandit grp, partnering works really well with this, ushally after 20 you can solo)<br />
<br />
23-30 Goblin rooms in Highhold keep (You can stay here till 35 if you wish but this is the fastest lvls i know of pretty much) <br />
<br />
OTHER OPTIONS 23-30 you can do LDON or South Karanna or sometin simple like that you can also do HHK guards.<br />
<br />
30-45 Crystal Cavrens, Its Recommended you bring a healer partner for this it can get very hairy in the vouls of CC. Kill orcs Terrors Spiders till 40 and then u can kill nids for Platz and exp till 45. <br />
<br />
OTHER OPTIONS 30-45 you can kill in LDon of course or HHK it is also possible to go into Gunthak and kill the mobs there Dl is also okay.<br />
<br />
45-50 Plane of Justice At this time you can get kei, you can either Stay in DL, Ldon , As of 46 you can go get a grp in PoJ, where a SK will either be stuck MT or made MT's backup. As you know you cannot enter PoJ until lvl 46, so get 46 asap and then go to PoJ.<br />
<br />
OTHER OPTIONS 45-50 you can Kill Bards and Nobles in HHK, but u will ushally need a partner.<br />
<br />
50-53 Plane of Justice or Plane of Innovation, Planes are good exp, and a SK can prolly tank here at this lvl, but be prepared to get hit a lil harder than 50-100dmg its more like 70-250.<br />
<br />
53-58 Plane of Innovation, Plane of Nightmares, Plane of Disease. Stay in Innovation or PoJ until you can get a PoN or PoD grp these are ushally good exp.<br />
<br />
58-60 Plane of Disease, Plane of Nightmares, these are pretty good exp and you can ushally not get a PoV grp until 60.<br />
<br />
60-62 Plane of Valor, Plane of Disease, PoV is a good exp and you can make 65 here as well as several AA,<br />
<br />
62-65 +AA, Baston of Thunder, Halls of Honor, These are awesome on Exp and Loot, AA also rocks here you always have other options on where you want to lvl.  LDON IS ALSO A OPTION AFTER LVL 20.<br />
<br />
-These are just some good ideas on lvls i belive are decent speed. Tell me if i am mistaken (i know i spelt something wrong)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shirou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Crushbone? &lt;--only DE war faction I think<br />
Nektulous?<br />
Paludal?<br />
Shadowhaven?<br />
<br />
Seems like the &quot;speedy&quot; path to 65. I get tired of people following a layout like this sometimes. :-/ It seems to work though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Taeluuan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Aye I have to agree blind followers of any guide miss so much of EQ. Players need to use them for ideas but not live by them, this one looks good to me, nice to point out about getting groups at certain levels and the hits you will take many guides neglect this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Seinharu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">heeh.. Aye they do i put this guide together with lvling several toons pass 50, SK's are ushally MT in Grps or assistant tank so they need to be able to do their jobs so of course grping is recomended so they learn their jobs.. and that faction thing is for even going into Neriak...<br />
Most the guards are warriors so u need to keep ur faction up enough</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kromglon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Bleh Im doing OT in the low 30's simply because I need the darn braids for the hammer. Id much rather be some place else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>AadinyeDuathiel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm DE and had to solo a lot at early levels because of time constraints.  I did 1-4 in Nek; 5-14 in Commons; 15-19 Lavastorm; 20-25 in OT; 26-30 doing the &quot;Bard run&quot; (Innothule, Feerott, Nek and back again).<br />
<br />
After 30, I went back to OT and started grouping.  I stayed there until 41 and got enough braids to get my hammer.  I went to DL from 41 to 50 and then Plane of Justice.  I am now 55 and have been having fun doing LDoN.  <br />
<br />
For me this wasn't a &quot;fast track&quot; because its taken me 15 months to get to 55 this way.  :)<br />
<br />
Do what ever works for you and have fun doing it.  And most important--All Bards Must Die!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Yabyab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">sounds like a good path, this is what I did..<br />
<br />
 1-6 Nek newbie area<br />
 6-12 Kurns Tower<br />
 13-16 solo bugs from hallowshade zone in, if you cant solo then duo them<br />
 16-20 solo fiends<br />
 20-24 bandits group<br />
 24-34 a group in SOLA (better XP than HHK for my experience and less camp fighting)<br />
 34-42 Kaesora<br />
 or<br />
 34-42 fear kiting Bosec in HHK<br />
 42-55 fear kiting boshinko and nobles<br />
<br />
 I know I spent most of my time soloing but the XP was awesome in HHK killing bosec at 34-42 then boshinko and nobles at 42+<br />
<br />
 55-58 PoD LCY or RCY<br />
 58-62 or even to 65 PoV<br />
<br />
 thats what I did to my toon, LDoN wasnt available at that time</div></div><hr />

I have tried to hunt in most zones in the game - not so thorough with Luclin and PoP, but getting there.  Variety is good, and there are a lot of fun zones out there to enjoy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bradven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm much too lazy to check, but I hope none of the people who post list like this also bitch about how many useless lvl 65's there are.</div></div><hr />
