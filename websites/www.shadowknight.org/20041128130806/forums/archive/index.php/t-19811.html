<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Takka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was wondering if anyone that could not open their skills screen was experiencing other bugs with their characters. I have a 52 SK on Morrell that has 206 in 2HS, 200+ in offense, Dexterity anywhere from 175 unbuffed to 255 buffed and misses constantly. I would say charater misses mobs that con greem about 40 - 50 % of the time and misses DB mobs about 60 - 70%. Anything higher than that is too embarrasing to mention. I have spoken with people in game and GMs who told me to report a bug. 2 weeks and no reply. Does this sound like a normal miss percentage to anyone? I have gone back to Crushbone at 51 and still miss orc centurions with some consistency =(. Thanks for any info into this.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ashrai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I solved this problem by turning off my misses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Oagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Aye, turn off that crap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Takka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It works!! Turned off misses and now I hit 100% of the time. Heh. Oh well. Thanks for the moral support. I did get a GM to escalate the issue to the SOE abyss. Guess I'll never hear from it again.</div></div><hr />
