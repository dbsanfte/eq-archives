Godamn these motherfucking race discussions and the newbie posters that come here and think that they have some deep revelation about the races and decide to post about it.<br />

FOR THE LAST MOTHERFUCKING TIME:<br />
<br />
ALL SHADOWKNIGHT RACES ARE VIABLE.  ALL SHADOWKNIGHT RACES HAVE STRENGTHS.  ALL SHADOWKNIGHT RACES HAVE WEAKNESSES.  SOME PHYSICAL, SOME SOCIAL.<br />
<br />
It ALL depends on your playstyle, and if someone wants to be a Human Shadowknight, so be it.  <br />
<br />
Someone else's choice for a race will never EVER affect you.  If you play an Iksar and someone else plays a gnome, YOU'RE STILL AN IKSAR.<br />
<br />
These threads seem to be more about justifying your choice for a Shadowknight race.  In the end, NO ONE GIVES A FUCK ABOUT YOUR RACE.  In the end, YOU ARE THE ONE THAT HAS TO HAVE FUN WITH IT, NOT EVERYONE ELSE.<br />
<br />
If you play a Shadowknight solely based on racial numbers and stats, you have missed the entire point of the game.  A character with gimped stats in the hands of an expert player is 1000x more desirable than a character with great stats and a fucktard playing him.  In other words, a good player playing a Human Shadowknight, whom is somehow viewed as having mediocre stats, will be 1000x better than a player with an Ogre Shadowknight and maxxed STA who has no clue about how to play the class.</div></div><hr />

Think this sums it all up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>kenshin_ex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">/agree<br />
<br />
look at the DE starting stats, we have shit all str/sta yet can still own a orge SK who naturally has the most str/sta!<br />
<br />
i also must agree that this post should be at the top all times!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Calamity_Daemon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">This is the Race Discussion part of the forum. What the hell are we supposed to do unless we can say &quot;Trollz are SO Uber!&quot; or &quot;Iksars are GODLIKE&quot;. It is these posts that keep us returning. YOu can say that you dont want it and act all big boy about it but really you do think its fun to argue or else you sorry ass wouldnt be here on the forum discussing stupid things like whether or not a gnome can outdamage a troll. SO be true to yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jobrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Didn't you say you were gonna leaving already, Calamity?<br />

I hate when people lie.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Calamity_Daemon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I will leave when I see it fit to do so. Although I do feel that you see my point and agree even if you dont like me.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kirhouk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thats why I dont visit/post on this website all that much. Every thread turns into a gimp flame totally missing the topic originally posted. Its, not just a problem with race discussion topics</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Lunaticfringesk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You are exactly correct Kirhouk. <br />
<br />
I am of a similar attitude now.<br />
<br />
Its very hard to enter into any meaningful discussion here.  Its a joke.<br />
<br />
Some of the frequent posters here have enormous arrogance.  What makes me laugh really hard is how shitty their characters are, yet they still boast as if they are the greatest ever.<br />
<br />
Its truly enjoyable when a meaningful discussion gets going.  Those are so few and far between, however, that the value of the board is hugely diminished.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jobrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">...says someone who's posts mostly consist of &quot;Ogre stun &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;All!!!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
You're more than welcome to never type &quot;shadowknight.org&quot; into your address bar ever again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Lunaticfringesk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Thanks for illustrating the point.<br />
<br />
A completely pointless, asshole-like, untrue comment  from someone with a laughable character.<br />
<br />
On the flip side of my desire to leave is the sheer joy of irritating you.  Even the hint that I frustrate you only makes me stay here even more.<br />
<br />
And the board would be far better served if you never typed in &quot;shadowknight.org&quot; ever again.  You are disrespectful, an asshole, and think you know it all.  I know I don't know it all--to bad you think you do.<br />
<br />
I apoligize to everyone else who reads this.  Its a waste of time to have to go through all of this B.S.  Im just so sick and tired of reading non-stop *insults* by many people on this board, particularily this jerk.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Spylmann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">You've got to admit, that was pretty funny. The irony, that is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jobrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Well, if nothing else Luna, the ignore option should right here next to my name. And as I recall, looking at your post history, you have posted mostly in Race Disscussion, and most of your posts have been unessisarily longwinded diatribes about how Ogres are the only viable race cuz they got stun immunity and you can't get it any other way. Admittedly, in some of your later posts you've gotten a little better, but you're still another one trick pony. <br />
<br />
Hell, you want arrogant asshole, go look at the way you've responded to some of the pillars of the community who dared disagree with your opinions on Stamina and Stun-immunity being the only viable things in determining a good SK back in some of your first posts. <br />
<br />
Posts mostly in one forum on one pet cause? I dunno, sounds Trollish to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Lunaticfringesk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I know not what you read, but I can assure you that I have *NEVER* stated that ogres are the only viable race.  That is totally incorrect.  Furthermore, Im not an ogre, so I would only be insulting myself.<br />
<br />
I used to post quite a bit in the race section about not only ogres, but trolls as well and had a lot of fun doing it.  The reason was because there was this popular school of thought at the time that suggested that INT was seemingly the most important stat. This school of thought was mostly borne from the smaller races defending themselves.  <br />
<br />
Yeah, I had fun attacking that because they completely missed the point--the XP penalty should have been the focus, not higher INT.  It wasnt until Breal came along and we started going back and forth where he pointed out the weakness in my argument, which was 100% correct--it is basically the XP penalty that balances the races--it has little, if anything, to do with higher INT.<br />
<br />
Apparantely, you missed that entire point, so hopefully I have communicated more clearly now.<br />
<br />
As far as acting like an ass, I will say this---they drew first blood, not me.  You will seldom, if ever, find me acting completely disrespecful first.  If you doubt my veracity, look at some of my posts then.  I have, on several occassions, even apologized for coming across as arrogant, but when assholes come along and post things like, &quot;You are fucking clueless...&quot; you are god-damn right I will most likely respond with something disrespectful.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jobrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Sorry Luna. I suppose my problem is just that my character is shitty. You're right. I've leave and not come back until I'm 65 with full Elemental :( That'll fix everything :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Darkbeat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The Thread Trying to Stop Race flames has become a flame ...................................................... the Irony<br />
<br />
                               &quot;Cant we all just get along?&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Calamity_Daemon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">This is what he wanted...of COURSE this would happen...Why would you say &quot;No arguments in the Race forum&quot; Uh...derdoink man! That what you do here! What are you gonna say this &quot;I chose troll because they are green.&quot; No your gonna get into some fist fights and I think that anyone who says NO LETS GET ALONG should just go to a Relativeness board or something and just let the people argue...Although Jobrill is one interesting guy as he always finds something to say back to ya )</div></div><hr />
