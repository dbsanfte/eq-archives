<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shainaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i have both.  IC took me exactly one year, to the day to get.  GM took me about a month.  Now, i was L58 when i finished my epic and it involved lots of guild and group work.  I did my GM completely solo (except the mirrior from chardok, I MQ'd it) but i am also L65.  GM is a fun quest because you get to delve into the iksar history and IMHO, kunark was the best expansion.  A lot of time and effort went into making it and the rest just don't seem to have as much detail.  Depending your level, you could do pretty much completely solo.  Most pieces are easy to obtain, just take a bit of time.  I did the droga part before the revamp so i have no idea what it will take to do it now and as far as i know City of Mist is about to change too BUT i willsay that i did both Droga and CoM parts within about 6 hours total in one day.  <br />

Both are worth doing.  Don't judge which to do by the ease of obtainment.  (that a word?)  Do both because you want to.  Don't let anyone else tell you different.  If you have the means and guild/group/friends backing, then do them both.  <br />
<br />
Nothing feels better then hearing someone say &quot;Wow, you are a dual epic shadowknight!&quot;   Good luck with whatever you decide.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">greenmist can be easy as pie... if you can spare some change and take advantage of all the droppable pieces.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jabbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">But... then they're also both broken.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shainaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">supposed to be fixed in the next up coming patch (i think July 9th)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Greenmist is an EXCELLENT quest, i really enjoyed it.  I did it cause i am really kinda just planning my guild raids for my epic and tired of sitting in CoD or PoD and killing stuff.  If your into the &quot;pride&quot; of having done these quests then nothing about your epic should hold you back from greenmist since realstically you prolly wont be able to work on your epic everyday you play (unless you have friends that really enjoy PoHate).  I say do em both i dont use greenmist very often until they fix it.  But i had a blast with it, especially tracking down the spy's in Firona Vie, that part was to cool :)</div></div><hr />
