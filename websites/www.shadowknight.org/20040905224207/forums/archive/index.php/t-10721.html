<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ribbed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Here's the dilemma, I'm turning my first account over to a freind, on it i have a decent 50 Troll.  The freind has agreed to give me all my euip back (cause he gets my sk and a 52 rogue) and i'm wondering what race to make.  I really enjoy the Trolls ( there the coolest) but I'am wondering if, since the oppertunity arose, should i consider a different race.  I like to tank alot and was considering either a ogre ( no stuns) or a iksar (regen and ac), but I would need some new armor if I decided on an iksar.  My current sk has 2050 hp and 900 ac (with 2 hander) 174 str 114 sta 133 agi 118 dex and 118 int.  If i do make another troll, what stats should i give up, and which ones should i concentrate on?  I was thinking of adding more starting points to dex, seeing as until level 51 i heal my self better with life tap procs than with life taps.  Please let me hear the suggestions, and sorry for no magelo link, dam firewalls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ribbed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I forgot to add something, atm i have 385 extra hp, and 275 extra mana, if that helps in the decision</div></div><hr />

I think ya mean ogre, right?  ;) <br />
<br />
<br />
One thought though...if its uber easy to get gear to increase AGI to over 75, why not dump all bonus points (assuming you are making a ogre sk) into INT?  Generally, we dont like to, nor do I believe it common, that we get into fights when we are naked.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>GenoReaper999</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You should make a human sk. ok we not the strongest, but i looked at your stats, im only lvl 43 atm, and they seem about the same as mine. Humans have a decent mana pool, dont require shrinking for raids, have nice starting faction, and all around even stats with no real weak areas. The only real drawback is the poor vision. But sk get correctional vision spells to compensate for that. Humans also have a natural resistance to poison and disease. Not to mention pretty good charisma as far as evils go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nlaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The bottom line is that you want to play the race that makes you happy.<br />
<br />
I like the new luclin models for Ogres, and I like the way they look in plate (like the World Devorour guy from the comic books) so I play an Ogre.<br />
<br />
Play what you like, min and maxing dont really mean much end game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nozgoth D'Burzum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I agree, choose a race that you think fits your personality. for instance I have a 46 dark elf war. he's not that great of a war and he will never dream of being uber, but god damn he looks cool in his armor and I enjoy playing him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>chardrok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Check that equipment and see how much is not iks wearable before you go that route.  No BE, No DF, No Sentient, etc. etc.<br />
And we get no cultural armor that's worth anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Lunaticfringesk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The IKS armor *ban* really doesnt have that big of an impact anymore, particularily at higher levels.  More and more armor is constantly coming out that IKS can wear.  It really isnt that big an issue at all.<br />

Wez gunna gut it back!<br />

Eh Im a Troll beastlord but my old main was an Ogre SK.  Play whatever you want.  Yeah it is friggin awesome being an Ogre.  No stun plus slam :cool:.   Although now with the fall of Grobb I have confidence there will be some cool Troll quests to fight the froggies.  Play whatever seems cool to you.</div></div><hr />
