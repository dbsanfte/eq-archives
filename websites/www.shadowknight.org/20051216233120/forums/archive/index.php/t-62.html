<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">velourea</div><div class="date">03-25-2002, 04:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hallo,<br />
<br />
i know that laotzu (http://pub38.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showMessage?topicID=291.topic)  wrote a good pulling guide on monkly business (which is bookmarked ;) ) but i was wondering if any more experienced SK pullers had anything to add about dungeon pulling. <br />
<br />
i recently did the Thick Banded Belt camp with another guild (basically like a pickup group b/c i didnt know any of the people) and i was the puller. unfortunately, i dont know my way around lguk very well and i would always bring back 2-4 mobs, which was ok because we had a chanter (and i was being lazy because of her ;)). more unfortunatly, one of my pulls caused the cleric to die in the chaos (but the main tank with the sword of skyfire didnt exactly help the situation /bonk). and i was wondering if you dungeon-savy shadow knights could offer any suggestions to help me in my slow learning of the whole indoor pulling thing (been in outdoor zones much too much).<br />
<br />
too bad most dungeons, esp old world dungeons, now adays are either BYOG or completely empty.</div></div><hr />

Shadow Knights are great at this technique and it is a great way to pull singles out of a group that aggros. You just cast darkness to aggro the group of mobs that you are pulling and then FD so that they will return to their spawn point.  The one that is snared will  take longer to get back or not move depending on what level of darkness you use.  Just stand up once the others have returned to their spawn point and the one that is darkend will come back for you.  You have to play with this way of pulling for a little while to get it down because sometimes the snared mob will still be to close to the group after you stand up and they will all reaggro.  Also sometimes darkness gets resisted on the first try so you have to quickly fd and let them re-set before you give it another try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krazix</div><div class="date">03-25-2002, 05:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't like using darkness to pull in dungeons<br />
<br />
Mainly cause:<br />
1) It's a dot, so if the snared one walks back first (which happens alot) it will remember you<br />
2) It really doesn't help that much in most places I pull as there is not enough room for 1 mob to get ahead of the other<br />
3) outside I just use fear pulling if its only 2 mobs or just regular FD pulling if its more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Naelael Sang'Noir</div><div class="date">03-25-2002, 05:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have never seen the darked mob walk back first..  Maybe with a real low lvl dark spell, but I know with the later ones, that won't happen.<br />
<br />
Fear pulling? Do you mean if you are outside, and 2 mobs there, you fear one and let the other come after your group? <br />
<br />
I don't think that sounds like a great idea, and if your lower lvl, its a good way to get your group slaughtered by adds. <br />
<br />
NOTE: I have never done it, but I do remember pretty well that at low-mid lvl's, if ever fear went off by accident when I was trying to cast another spell, it was a problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pajita</div><div class="date">03-25-2002, 05:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've had the darked mob walk back first before 49.  But once you get dooming darkness, that's no concern.  If even if the mob TRIES to walk back, it's at it's &quot;walking pace&quot; and the snare is enough to hold it there while the others go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">synnoira</div><div class="date">03-25-2002, 06:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">darkness pulling works once you get dooming, so pre-49 not much point really, just try standard FD pulling, still getting the hang of darkness pulling myself, timing dooming is the trick because it takes bloody ages to cast<br />
best thing i've found for dungeon pulling is simply getting to know the zone's pathing, pop times and layout, really the actual mechanics of FD pulling are the same everywhere<br />
fear pulling? hmm did somebody once say that worked on the druids in WC? fear one and while he runs off kill the other or something, did try it the once fearing the female drood but she paths in tiny lines back and forth, should have tried it on the guy as well i suppose<br />
might be worth a try on the rangers in EC too, can't think of too many other spots you'd want to try it, most especially not in a dungeon<br />
 i have fear up all the time for outdoors but indoors it gets taken off first thing, don't want any accidents happening</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Emnity</div><div class="date">03-25-2002, 06:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Best thing i've found so far is chain agro, there's usually a greeny off to the side that if you tap will bring one of his friends but not both. The greeny is easy to deal with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krazix</div><div class="date">03-25-2002, 08:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fear pulling = Fear one.. soon as you see Fear message wears off FD<br />
<br />
Easy way to split a 2 for solo'in (IE: Guards in WC, druids ect)<br />
<br />
Also a good thing to do in OT DL FM LOIO = run them pansy's outta there with yer massive trains!! &gt;=)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Groobash</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 03:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used to debuff casters a lot when pulling. You dispell one, they all come running, you FD, the dispelled one stops and rebuffs itself while the others run home. I still use it sometimes.<br />
<br />
In some places the other ones will stop and buff him too tho. heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mordeth</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 08:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another way to work fear pulling (depending on the level of the mobs you want to split) is to fear one of the mobs. Again depending on the level the only thing that will happen is the feared mob will run away leaving the rest of the mobs at their spawn points... Follow the feared mob a ways out (so that when fear breaks it comes to you instead of going back to spawn point) and then pull it back to your camp spot... This was a successfull tactic at around 47 when I was doing gobos in LOIO, when I could not simply single pull from spawn point..</div></div><hr />
