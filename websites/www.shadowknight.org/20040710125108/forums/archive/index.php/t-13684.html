<br />
Are you saying that you would actually like to group with people so dedicated to roleplaying that they wont group the morally impaired?  <br />
<br />
Its a choice they have the right to make, but I wouldnt want to be caught dead hanging with that bunch of dumbass freaks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmm..your lucky Im tired and want to go to bed..and my wife is helping me type....or I would flame you for being a whining ass loser cause some druid doesnt want to hunt with you..if you want a group so bad then make a cleric...You know its like how it was with my necro at first no one wanted me until they saw what I could do...So maybe you just suck...either way get over it or change classes....<br />
<br />
But Im tired and need to get to bed so I wont flame you tonight maybe tomorrow if Im not busy...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rugs Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I was just making a comment about impatience of responding to your own post after one day.  This site is full of great info, but if you make a response to your own post...chances are a flame is gonna come right after.  Its best to just wait and let a thread die than to feel bad about it.<br />
<br />
Oh, and to Antihero, flame away.  Maybe you can get your wife to give you some great tips.  Ask around the neighborhood and see what all the &quot;youngins&quot; are saying for cuss words too.  I dont get that shit about druids and whatever else you were droning on about either.<br />
<br />
I never said I wanted to quit my class, I never whined cause nobody wants to hunt with me, and I never bothered to dick around with the LFG tool cause Im only either grouped or soloing.<br />
<br />
So, when you crawl out of bed at 1 pm and hit the bottle, lumber on back and write up another random tangent about clerics, wood nymphs, bunny slippers...or whatever the fuck else would really get me good!  <br />
<br />
I just feel so &quot;lucky&quot; you didnt flame me before I went to sleep, that would sting like hell.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Seku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have a /shout I do sometimes just for fun or to harass those who think SK are morally impaired.<br />
<br />
/shout Looking for dorfs, halflings or gnomies. I dip em in tar and put em in torchholders in my home (don't ask where the wick goes) when the fat renders they make an awesome light and the screams of pain and terror add to the ambience of ANY home.<br />
<br />
Well one day I threw that out just for fun and some idiot shouted across the zone (think it wa LGuk) that I needed to find Jesus. I asked if he was lost or needed to find his corpse as I had corpse find. Then he got really frothing over my needing gawd. About that time half the zone dumped on him for  messing with me and to take his Jesus someplace else. The consensus was they liked my role-playing and didn't like his outside the game stuff.<br />
<br />
While I think that SK sometimes don't get groups it isn't because people view us as morally inferior but don't really see the abilities of an SK. They think they need a ranga for pulling and a war for tanking. While other folks I talk to say they would rather have an SK for an XP group than a war. The real problem is that we are perceived as not being as effective as another tank in XP groups.<br />
