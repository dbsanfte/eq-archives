<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Stryph</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Paladins get a 25% self haste spell at 49. I've been thinking, why can't we get something similar? I mean 20% haste with a 50dd or some stupid shit. They've already shown they make spells that create dd effects and have absolutely nothing to do with the recourse of the spell (ZB, AoH and AoP come to mind). So why not a haste spell that does small damage and hastes us at the same time with a duration of like 10 minutes or so (Instead of the 45 minute paladin haste, ours like all our buffs would have to be recasted constantly). Of course the stacking would be it can't stack with chanter/shaman haste but hell, it'd help during soloing...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dkhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yea, suffer you lazy bastard. Paladins need haste cause they suck and would whine like the women that they are if they had to go camp SF.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Stryph</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Bleh fuck that eyepatch, I wouldn't use it for anything other then the effect. Even then it's not worth the time invested in getting it imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>synnoira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">We get mana regen, they get a self-haste. Mana regen is better because more useful in more situations. You can also kill THO for that belt if you're that keen on a haste spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Stryph</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">We get mana regen, they get a self-haste<br />
<br />
How much is our mana regen suppose to account for though. They have much higher heals (470 vs 1170) Self haste, More then double powered self procs (Not counting SA3 since it costs so many aa's). I mean some things just don't add up. I'd like to see SK's with a self haste spell, but I guess that's just me. That or all the people that can't kill THO or don't have the time to camp that accursed griffin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>synnoira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Mana regen counts for a lot because it can still be useful even in PoP. You have Mental Corruption plus the lich spells. At lower levels that helps with fear-kiting and in groups, and in PoP it helps with aggro-kiting or in groups. How does the paladin self-haste help? They aren't tanking too many PoP mobs solo.<br />
<br />
They get powerful proc buffs for the same reason they get Slay Undead, because it's limited to use on only one mob type. Great for them in some zones but otherwise no good. We get abilities are of far more general use giving us a far more varied choice for solo xp.<br />
<br />
What's self-haste going to do for you actually? Help you melee when you fear-kite sure, but how often do you get that opportunity in PoP? Best xp will be in a group, in which case you'll almost always have a slower, chanter/bard/shaman/beastlord, all have haste for you, so self-haste is meaningless. If you want to solo you can go back and get crap xp fear-kiting old wolrd mobs now, but truth is you're better off aggro-kiting in PoP where melee dps is besides the point. What you need then is some mana regen, and that we have even if there is no enchanter around.<br />
<br />
Because haste is a good thing, self-haste spell sounds like a good thing to many folk, but when you actually look at it, it's not all that special these days.</div></div><hr />
