<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>magget</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi All, <br />
<br />
For the last couple of months I have been repeatedly kicked out of The Grey zone while trying to reach SSRA. <br />
<br />
I am able to zone into The Grey with NO issue at all. I am able to move around relatively close to the Zone-in from Letalis (or whatever that ajoining zone is). Once I begin running to SSRA I get kicked completely out and I have to petition to have the GMs move my character. Here is what I tried... <br />
<br />
1. Tried running a different path within the grey on my way to SSRA. <br />
<br />
2. Deleted the Files for The Grey and let it repatch. <br />
<br />
3. Reloaded from disks the Luclin files. <br />
<br />
4. I got an error about authorization so then I loaded from disk the PoP files after step 3 above. <br />
<br />
5. I did /bug /feedback /petition and I don't wish to try tech support. Maybe I have to. GRRRRR <br />
<br />
6. I checked the luclin models and I don't believe I had changed them in ages. <br />
<br />
7.  I use the default UI.<br />
<br />
However, before I try tech support, I would like any feedback from anyone else who has experienced this issue and can help out. <br />
<br />
It is very frustrating not being able to get to a zone I used to. <br />
<br />
Any other suggestions? <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rocraft</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Same happens to me on Veeshan server.  I get kicked out but I find what has worked best for me is just go invis and point myself directly at ssra ent and hit auto run so when I crash I usually end up at wall to zone in of ssra and then can log in without a problems periodically though I overshoot ssra and end up hitting a wall in the grey and have to go about the whole thing all over again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>magget</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My apologies for bumping this but I am still trying to get a resolution to this issue.<br />
<br />
I have since done the following:<br />
<br />
1.  Contacted Tech support but no solution<br />
2.  Upgraded my video card driver (Intel 82845G/GL)<br />
3.  Upgraded to DirectX 9.0b<br />
4.  Changed Refresh rate to 75Hz and back to 60Hz<br />
5.  Deleted and repatched The Grey<br />
6.  Reloaded from disk the Luclin files<br />
7.  Adjusted options in log-in screens<br />
8.  Turned /showgrass off<br />
9.  Turn off and back on the 3D Sky and a few other settings<br />
<br />
I had hunted in The Grey many times before.  I know others have had this issue before as well.  I am just trying to find a solution and any ideas/thoughts are certainly welcomed.  Other than throwing my computer out of the window and buying a whole new one.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />
