<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nurbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After completing Epic 1.5 Gilihna will send you to City of Mist to find Kilidina.  He is FD not for from the zone in on the right.  Upon hailing him he will go live.  Info on him.  He hits for 4700 max but like most OOW mobs its not to hard to tank.  He casts Plasma Decay AE the nastyone from Grummus.  He does the 3 minute mez that Terris Thule's adds in Time do.  And there was another AE.  With 12 Qvic geared folks we managed to burn him down.  He didn't have alot of hps but did bring some pain.  It was close with those 12.  He drops a head which you return to Gilihna.<br />
<br />
Gilina Yilzior takes the head from you and holds it by the hair.  Gilina casts a small spell and the head springs to life.  'Talk, Kilidna.  What has happened to you?'  Kilidna's head begins to sob.  'I am sorry, master.  I was corrupted by evil magic!  Now look at me!  I dare say I will not be able to finish my studies any time soon.'  Gilina scowls, 'What did you find out while in the city of mist?  Tell me now!'  'Well master, it seems that when Innoruuk's Voice was summoned to this plane, it drew the attention of many [powerful beings].'<br />
<br />
Gilina Yilzior says 'Yes, what powerful beings? Out with it, head!'  'Well, master, one of these powerful beings has resurrected Lhranc from the dead!  When I confronted him, he turned me into a mindless zombie!  I overheard Lhranc talking about recovering the sword for himself.  You are both in great danger!  Lhranc cannot be defeated in his current form and he will surely be coming for the sword!'  Gilina tosses Kilidna's head aside.  'Thank you, Kilidna.  Your services are no longer required.  Well it seems we have quite the [dilemma] on our hands, wouldn't you say?'<br />
<br />
Gilina Yilzior says 'Luckily, I have much knowledge of Lhranc, the first of the shadowknights.  We must find a way to anchor him to this plane so that he will be vulnerable to our attacks.  I believe if we recover some items of his from his former life, we may be able to accomplish this.  First, you will need to find his pendant.  Look for it in the City of Mist.  Next, you will need to recover Lhranc's corroded bracer from Charasis.  Lastly, you will need to find Lhranc's ring from the undead in the Kithicor Woods.  Once you have all these items, return them to me.'<br />
<br />
<br />
The next collection phase begins.  WIll update if I find any of these items.  I am going to Kithichor.  Fell free to send me Tells on Brell about Epic 2.0.  The walkthrough for 1.5 is very accurate so follow it =)<br />

Hits for 4700 but isnt hard to tank.<br />
<br />
Hmm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">His max is up there... doesn't mean he will hit for that for any kind of frequency. Thats what makes him tankable. High max hit, low ATK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nurbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">We had 2 clerics and 2 warriors.  The warriors were never in danger of dying basically.  He had probably 150k'ish hps.  I need to find some wizards to AE all of CoM and Charsis hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shaithiss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've seen his pendant drop from black reavers, didn't have a chance to identify it though, as a druid friend linked it to me and asked me if I needed it for my epic (1.0), I told her no, but it was probably for the 1.5 / 2. No idea on rarity, I just know it drops from black reavers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Croix VorAbaddon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Somehow, and sorry to sound so, but I think this post is BS.. either that or SOE is f'in insane. Here's why.<br />
<br />
Plasma Decay. I've watched that drop people fast, and this mob is near the entrance of CoM? Either this isn't true, or this is a disgusting and repulsive move for SOE... some people like hunting in CoM, there are new and old epic involvements there.<br />
<br />
Plus a 3 minute mez and ANOTHER AE....<br />
<br />
Again, pardon ym questioning this, but I'm praying your wrong, otherwise I can kiss my epic 2.0 goodbye. Guess not being in a High end raiding guild is an offense to SOE, right? Fucking bastards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Krushum Gudended</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">you need to activate the mob, and epic 2.0 is for high end raiders<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Talanon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">SoE has stated time and time again. Epic 1.5 is for casual raiders/lower end guilds. Epic 2.0 is SUPER HIGH END RAIDING END ALL BE ALL! I mean for christs sake you just a wepon thats &gt; GBoC for a grand total of MAYBE 40 hours invested at max. Give it a rest.....<br />
<br />
Edit: beat by 2 minutes damn you Krush!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Croix VorAbaddon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">you need to activate the mob, and epic 2.0 is for high end raiders<br />
<br />
deal with it<br />
<br />
<br />
Alright, I understand that... but in.. CoM? The placement is awful.<br />
<br />
And the old epic's needed raiders, but not necessarily high end. I knew a guild that prided itself on not being high end, but doing high end things due to strategy and know how... but I don't see any way that will save you here. Gear is damn near a necesseity...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Lzert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Since the mob wont do anything until activated, it doesn't really matter where it is.  Not like CoM is supercrowded with newbs trying to level anyway :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>kuulaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">An SK at the proper progression in their Epic needs to activate the mob, not just any jo schmo.<br />
<br />
<br />
This event likely wont happen often enough to disrupt grouping CoM with any regularity.<br />
<br />
<br />
I am sure 2.0 will be better,<br />
<br />
but 1.5 is hella nice, given the effort required, casual players have zip to complain about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Croix VorAbaddon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hmmm... actually, this brings to mind an idea. Could anyone whose taken this thing on post info about the range of the AE, if you know it, and perhaps a log-parse of it's apprximate HP?<br />
<br />
I'm thinking 10 or so ranger, out of AE range, once the AE hits once, they run in, Trueshot as one. That's a nasty bit of DPS... maybe a few HT's and Lifeburns as well... Hmm....<br />
<br />
Edit: Forgot, also, what's the recast on the plasma Decay?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Nurbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">A raid force capable of killing Grummus can probable kill him.  He isnt super hard.  24 elemental geared folks can drop him np I would imagine.  Just do MGB heals.  His placement is PERFECT read the text on why your going to see him and the lore behind the epic.  It makes sense.<br />
<br />
Anyone had any luck with drops yet?  I am sick of clearing CoM already.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, when the alliance I'm in gets around to it, I'll send up a report of how we did. The current focus is Sol Ro himself, so, If a Grummus raid foce can do it, I'd imagine this guy can be taken...<br />
<br />
I really need to get better gear, throws me off on most numbers.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ohh and as to the: &quot;ITS FOR SUPER HIGH END ULTRA-GOOD WESOAWESOME RAIDERS&quot; Can it. Epics should be for everyone who can get the force together and pull off the strat, not those with enough gear. I know it's otherwise, but don't expect people to like it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Thaln V'Orro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Numbers and force dont mean shit, just because you have a 24 friends to do a mob doesnt mean you are entitled to do it.  EQ is about progression, and if you arent at that point in progression you need to STFU.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kelv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Croix, sorry to break it out to you, but you are an idiot.<br />
<br />
EQ is not fair, there will always be a large gap between high end gamers and casual/lower end gamers, because guess what? Thats what keeps the high end gamers playing.<br />
<br />
And when epics 1.0 came out, you had to be in a high end guild to get them, because they were (mostly) hard to finish.<br />
<br />
<br />
Epic 1.5 is already a slap in the face of the high end gamers who ha to get to PoTime, it makes sense that Sony makes up for it somehow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tropics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">It actually better get a whole lot harder. I am kinda disapointed at the quests so far. They are short, and lacking in variety with the stuff to be done basically entailing running around and camping semi-rare to rare drops (PoG, PoN). This mob sounds tough, but if 12 people owned him, even Qviq people, that is a little weak. First step I guess. I hope there are alot more steps to do this one then the 1.5, I want to see a epic that will take at least a month to complete, working fairly hard on it each day. I also want to see some absolute beasts needing to be killed, end game GoD, end game OoW level fights taking huge raid forces of Qvic level people just to have a chance.<br />

This comming from a EP level guilded player.</div></div><hr />

No GNM on it.<br />
<br />
I mean come on I KNOW we all hate Gnomer SHD, but you cant tell me that the Devs would prevent them from getting epic 2.0</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>mulletess</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">HI all<br />
<br />
My comments on people thinking anyone should be able to do epic 2.0<br />
<br />
I don't have my epic 1.5 but plan on working on it.  I am normally pro casual argument but in this case Epic 2.0 should only be for high end players.  The 1.5 is amazing we have nothing to complain about.<br />
<br />
If this is the case I will never get 2.0 but hey you can't always get what you want.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Nurbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Well I reached the cockblock point of the Epic 2.0's tonight so it all ends with the last collection part.  Here is the text. <br />
<br />
As you can see you will need Anguish access to continue.  This is the only locked zone in OOW.  As for the final 3 drops for the collection part.<br />
<br />
Gilina Yilzior takes the items from you and holds them before you in her hands.  She mutters an incantation and the items meld into one.  'This item will be used to help anchor Lhranc to this plane of existence.  The anchor will not be enough however.  In an area in the Realm of Discord known as Anguish, you will need to find a globe of discordant energy.  This will be used to infuse the earthly anchor with the power of discord.  When you have these two items, hand them to my contact, Filligno the Slayer. He has tracked down Lhranc in Dranik, the Ruined City in the Realm of Discord.  He will need your help to get Lhranc's attention however.<br />

CoM - Black reavers drop the Pendanet<br />
Charsis - A random golem in the East wing dropped the Bracer (LONG camp)<br />
Kithichor - Riazen Commander dropped the Ring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Iosif_McCloud</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I agree that 1.5 is a joke...<br />
<br />
Something that i mostly did in 1 afternoon is completable by anyone and it better then my GBoC...  Yeah Fuck Sony...<br />
<br />
Do you really think soiny made ST with a script that would CHNAGE it becuse thay wanted EVERYONE to see it ? Thay wanted a few select people to see it and thay did...<br />
<br />
Do you really think that VT ws ment for EVERYONE to see? I dont think so Why else would it Require a NO DROP pice thay you get after killing EMP in SSRA<br />
<br />
My point it that not everyone will experiance the High end game... Becuse it was not made for everyone to experiance.. back in the day CT / Inno / Naggy /VoX were the shit.. Now thay are low end Farm mobs...  Maybe in 2-3 more years the base level of EQ will have progressed enuf to allow for the normal ppl to get Epic2.0<br />
<br />
But then again your bitching about a QUEST thats not even compleated</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Xanathol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">IMO the 'balance' of 1.5 &amp; 2.0 is pretty nice. Not overwhelming for a non-raider to get to a truely nice weapon, yet IMO, for most non-raiders, still a challenge, and 2.0 should be a nice reward for the raiders, and may be impossible for a non-raider to get, while 1.5 doesn't take up too much of the raider's time to complete. I am fine with this, and hope the 2.0 reward is to raiders what 1.5 is to non-raiders. /hatsoff Sony</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Dude, why do you whine so much about everything... <br />
You whine in every damn post you make ...<br />
<br />
and pardon me for saying, but you dont deserve the epic 2.0 regardless , kthx.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Krazaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Proof that nothing SOE will ever do will make everyone happy.<br />
<br />
SOE specifically added the 1.5 step in the epic quest so that people who would otherwise have no hope of ever getting the epic could do it.<br />
<br />
If you aren't in a raiding guild, then Innoruuk's Voice is your epic.  It's the best weapon in the game that you have access to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Nurbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Croix what weapon are you currently using?  I don't even need to know the answer to that to know that Epic 1.5 is going to be an insane upgrade for you and very much doable regardless of your gear level.  It will truely be &quot;Epic&quot; in its nature for you.  For me Epic 1.5 took me maybe 8 hours at most to complete and is more of a toy really.  3 other SK's in my guild have weapons that do better DPS.  Epic 1.5 is only a stepping stone really.  It is a slight upgrade for me and was worth the 8 hours I spent on it.  SoE was actually thinking for a change by dividing the epic up like this.  Non-raiding folks have an epic quest where they need to get 1-2 groups together to complete and a final fight where they need 30ish that yeilds them something better then they could ever hope to get.  Raiding folks have a goal and an epic they can get that will be better then everything else in the game.  Personally in your situation I would be happy as hell about a 61/35 weapon I could get not being in a raiding guild.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Got my ring off of a rotting knight.  Seems to be the mobs with the mummy heads and zombie bodies that drop it.  Rotting\Revenging Knight and Risen Corporal\Commander.  This took a few &quot;days&quot;  (meaning 30 minutes each day over 4 days) to get.<br />
<br />
Haven't started bracer yet.  Wish me luck. <br />
<br />
<br />
As for Kilidna, I made the mistake of hailing him before actually finding out that he turns into an assbeater.  He HT'd me for 1221 and managed a max hit of 1200 before I feigned him off.  No AE's hit me.  Someone claimed he and his pet got hit with around a 5K AE DD but I find that highly unlikely.  They were probably just trying to get me to find a rez for them by guilt tripping me.   In any case, I warned them not to get too near Kilidna because he spawned as an assbeater.</div></div><hr />
