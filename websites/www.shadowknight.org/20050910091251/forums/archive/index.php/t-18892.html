<br />
What is the biggest mob you can tank?<br />
I've done auliffe chaoswind/brynju thunderclap with 2 clerics on a 12 person tower raid, no vie.. DI saved me once.<br />
<br />
We were sitting at insig's the other day getting some recruits rift'ed and only had 1 warrior who had 7.5khp buffed, I'm at around 7650 and had higher ac/more defensive aa's than him so i tossed around the idea of me tanking emp. Not exactly an ideal knight tank mob though(long fight, wizzies/dps not gonna be able to take advantage of knight agro cause they just go oom by the end of the fight even with a warrior tanking). ended up being a moot point cause one of our MT warrior's logged in so we didn't have to worry bout it.<br />
<br />
I'm thinking of tanking as far as raid targets that aren't usually knight tanked(mb/tz... any of the zergfest pop fights)</div></div><hr />

The more Uber you are the more uber mob you have tanked. To follow the Topic, the hardest mob i have tanked is prolly Warlord in PoEb, was more acting rune tho so clerics wouldnt get agro and waited for MT2 to get agro. First time i tanked a bossmob from horseback to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maicom</div><div class="date">12-12-2003, 05:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ya we can tank anything at end game, but i was wondering what non end-game sk's have done. the ones without 10k+hp buffed etc. so maybe i could get an idea of what i could tank personally next time we are short a decent warrior</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Winkles</div><div class="date">12-12-2003, 07:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I know that this is kinda lowly compared to other folks but at 55 I tanked the 2 guards outside the castle in PoNightmare.  And one time without a slower who died after being summoned and smashed real fast.  After mob resisted about 8 slows not even chaining cd could keep him from being summoned.  This may not be a big feat but when you have around 4500hp and 1100ac buffed then a unslowed mob hitting for 500+ is a pretty big deal.  I actually had to equip the ole sarnak battleshield to raise up the ac lol.  Was fun and we had only one death but we figured it was kind of a waste of clerics mana for mobs that drop nothing.</div></div><hr />

Edit:  Was pretty trivial, dont think i dipped below 60 except once, i was at 1560 ac 7550 hp buffed.  The dps of ntov mobs isnt that scarey anymore =P</div></div><hr />

Not true. mobs that quad for 3000+ (blazzax, arch mage , firetail and reparm in PoF, TZ, VZ and Quarm in plane of time) can 1 round a SK even with 11,000+ hps buffed. There is a lot of luck involved in using a non defensive warrior on those mobs.</div></div><hr />

With my enchanter. :D<br />
<br />
Well, not a big deal if you look at the math of it. Quad 600some, AE (for Lord Koi'Doken) something like 300 damage, and a bash around 250 makes for at most around 3k damage at any given time.. pretty much any person there coulda tanked him so long as you can reach 3500 hp buffed which probably all nonint casters then were at, and even a fair bit of our int casters.<br />
<br />
...but the math ruins the fun of an enchantertank. :( Sorta like explaining magic tricks.</div></div><hr />
