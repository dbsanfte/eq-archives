<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zobb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Cloak of Luclin is seriously broken compared to Pally spells. Brells Stalwart Shield and even the Rangers Strength of Tunare are group spells, CoL is self only. I can live with that even though it makes no sense. The problem comes with Pallys self only spell Aura of the Crusader. AotC stacks with Virtue and BSS, giving the Pallys a significant HP bonus that we cant achieve. That gives them a significant leg up in tanking and grouping over us.<br />
<br />
Cloak of Luclin - SK<br />
HP: 279<br />
AC: 18<br />
DS: 10<br />
Self only<br />
<br />
BSS - Pal<br />
HP: 330<br />
Group<br />
<br />
Aura of the Crusader - Pal<br />
HP: 350<br />
AC: 30<br />
Mana Regen: 3/tick<br />
Self only<br />
<br />
So in a raid situation, a SK would have the following configuration:<br />
<br />
KM: 910hp<br />
Po9: 618hp 32 ac<br />
Fo7: 544hp<br />
CoL: 279hp 18ac<br />
<br />
That gives the SK a 2351 hp bonus and 50 ac. Of course in most raids SKs have BSS on instead of CoL to maximize HP, so that would be 2402 hp and 32ac bonus. Now compare that to a Pally in the same raid:<br />
<br />
Virt: 1405hp 72ac<br />
Fo7: 544hp<br />
BSS: 330hp<br />
AoC: 350hp 30 ac<br />
<br />
That makes the Pallys configuration 2629hp and 102ac. Thats a 278hp and 51ac difference over us. Thats a significant difference.<br />
<br />
Either CoL should get a bigger hp and ac bonus as a self only buff, to put us on par with Pallys, or it should finally be made into a group spell. And can we finally make it so Call of Rathe doesnt over write CoL?!<br />
<br />
We should really fight for this, since Pallys are also going to a have a big advantage over us in LDoN undead dungeons. We are getting left behind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinsei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Adding an Illusion:Lesser Akhevan would make me more inclined use it...and perhaps make it 350-400hp, 40 ac and a 15 ds. Perhaps another hp regen added to it? Say 3 hp like the 3 mana of a paladin's? And have them nerf that damn pally lvl 9 stun, make 'em use the 15 one like we do :mad: Oh, and that damn overwriting shit's gotta stop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Blackstone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">F-illusions.  I have plenty and I can get anyone that I want from chanters thanks very much.  Lets not waste time on things that don't actually help our play.<br />
<br />
Now.<br />
<br />
As for Aura of the Crusader, yeah this bothers me a good bit.  Basically, a Paladin is going to be 200hps greater than an SK, given the same or equivalent gear.<br />
<br />
200hps is a lot of hitpoints.  You might not think that at the Time/Elemental level 200 is much, but you would be wrong.<br />
<br />
Hps are like a sea wall.  If you are fighting whimpy things, it doesn't matter whether you have 9k or 8.8k hps when fully buffed, but when you are fighting things that can drop you in 2 rounds (or worse 1 round) every single hps makes a difference as to whether you can live or not.  A free 200 hps is a big advantage.  Its like having an extra equipment slot and then filing that slot with a Plane of Time god loot.<br />
<br />
This needs to get resolved.  The easiest thing to do is make Cloak of Luclin stack with BSS in the same way that Aura of Crusader do.<br />
<br />
Basically, a Paladin can have BSS and Aura of the Crusader up, but not Protection of the Nine -- so they have Hand of Virtue instead.<br />
<br />
In the end they trade a small amount of mana regen for a large amount of AC and HPS.  If they want to (and most do).  We should get to make that same choice.  200hps advantage is a little unreasonable I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well we could do what the druids did make a petition to SoE.  BtW when I mentioned this differential to a Paladin in my guild he pointed out that SK's are DPS class where as Paladins are defensive thats why they get the extra HP being a cleric class.  <br />
<br />
Now as far as having CoL stack with BSS I don't like the idea of having to be dependent on Pally for buffs I would rather have another self buff thats stacks with CoL or improve CoL. Btw I have gotten 5 runes and traded them in and got Touch of Innoruuk every time.  I can't even get CoL and its never for sale</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Valkyria Grymreaper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Make our self-only cloaks stack? <br />
<br />
Oh, and take that useless DS off of them - change it too like +8 atk for CoA and +10 atk from CoL for instance. <br />
<br />
Like Inferna's pally buddy said we are DPS they are defense. Then give us atk on those instead.<br />
<br />
/shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xanathol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I second the attack approach - I am fine with them having more HP/AC if we'd get a decent attack boost from CoL. And screw group buffing...I like self only, but as mentioned elsewhere before, self only should be better than what we can get from others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mavorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I would like to add that CoL does not seem to stack with Call of the Rathe which is an added 24 ac.  If a paladin gets that buff they effectively have 75 more ac.  To balance this CoL should be adjusted to give the same total of HP that a paladin with his BSS/Aura/Virtue set up and stack with CotR.  CoL/PoT9/Kazad giving us the same amount of HP would only promote balance.<br />
<br />
Also as an SK I do not find myself to be a true DPS class in the sense that yes I can produce amazing burst DPS with spears/lifetaps/HT but overtime our DPS is not very high.  Our melee abilities are as poor as the paladins so I do not see how we truly are a DPS oriented class.<br />
<br />
Edited because I cat spel :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>darkzero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">do not take away the damage shields component please.<br />
<br />
   mOre ds !  give us a higher level improvement of banshee aura too ! <br />
<br />
<br />
  just let the spells stack like the paladin line can and shazam, improvement of hp/ac at the cost of some mana regen.  good options of tradeoffs and resolves the complaint</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Chiteran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">This has been discussed a few times and i have changed my mind a bit. I think the pallies deserve a bit more HP than us, i feel to superior to them anyway to care if the have more HP fully buffed. BUT i would like CoL to give a bit more hp than BSS so the spell dont get fucking useless when there are pallies around.. I hate to need our counterparts buffs to max hp.<br />
<br />
Leave it all as it is but increase the hp gain on col to above 330 (yeah i would even be satisfied with 331 hp, just so i can use my SELF ONLY buff for a reason instead of pallies version... OR take out the ac part and make it 350-400 hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ziglug D</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If we are a DPS class. Then why did SoE give us aggro increasing spells???</div></div><hr />

If we are a DPS class. Then why did SoE give us aggro increasing spells???  <br />
NO we arent a DPS class.. YES we are a TANKCLASS.. And YES we have best DPS of all TANKCLASSES.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Supersk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I agree we are not a damn dps class we are tank's we should be compensated as such.With some our self buffs that fact we have to rely on paladins is BS we are generaly a self sufficent class and givin us better smoethign that stack's with or make'n CoL better would be  most benifical to us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Dragantis Xy`Rath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I don't think we are a DPS class in the slightest bit. Sure we can pump it out when we have to, but it costs a lot and our true potential can only be achieved once every 72 minutes. If they would make CoL with an ATK component rather than a DS and adjust our caps so that Paladins have lower offensive skills and we have lower defensive skills....then maybe I would see the balance. As it stands now, they get the same caps that we do, and we have to rely on them for buffs and even with thiers they can still beat us in terms of defensive buffs. It is utter BS and I for one just wish our spell would stack with BSS/Virt and not Po9/SoK. The HP could use a tweak too, make it 320 or something and ditch the DS or change it to 10atk.<br />
<br />
There are many ways that they could balance this spell, but in the last year they have proven that they have no intention of doing so. We have been bitching about this for ever now. I for one only use it when I solo or in groups after my raid buffs fade, and any more I don't even use it when I solo. If I am soloing then I am in PoP and most the stuff I solo never gets near me...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">One problem I see, is AotC seems to be a decendant of the Bulwark line of cleric spells.  That was justification why they get AotC and BSS.   Guess what?  Cleric bulwark line of spells dont stack with focus.  And AotC does.<br />
<br />
Its a stacking issue, and CoL is shitty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Valkyria Grymreaper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Perhaps DPS was a bad term to use. My bad,  Chiteran hit the nail on the head for what I meant to say.<br />
<br />
But I stand by my post for the DS on our cloak spells. C'mon, at the level you get and use these, the DS is worthless and you know it.<br />
<br />
If we have to take the hit HP wise vs paladins to use our cloak spells because of stacking issues, so be it.  Just give us something better then those lame ass DS on them.<br />
<br />
ATK is better then a 10 point DS any day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Blackeagle Dwimmerlaik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">SOE wants pallies to have AotC to give them a defensive boost over us.  It really is pretty justified honestly, since they're the defensive knight.<br />
<br />
Now.  That being said, BSS should not be more beneficial in most situations than Cloak of Luclin.  They're both level 65 spells, one hits a group, the other is self only.  The group one being more effective than the self only one goes against everything in EQ.<br />
<br />
What I would like them to do is up CoL to 350 hps and up the AC to 26 so that call of the rathe doesn't overwrite us, and saves us a buff slot when we would normally use call of the rathe.  Leave the DS component as it is.</div></div><hr />
