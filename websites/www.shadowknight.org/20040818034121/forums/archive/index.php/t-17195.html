<br />
As I understand it you need to complete 1 of the magic, combat or stealth manuals, and the only hard part for all three quest series are the second part.<br />
<br />
So, which mob is easier?<br />
<br />
Junk Beast for the Power source for combat manual<br />
<br />
or...<br />
<br />
Vhaksiz the Shade for the heart for the magic manual<br />
<br />
or...<br />
<br />
Rallicus Rattican for the head for the stealth manual</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Arangar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">dissregard ;) I just read the whole post...after saying you need any manual...then it says you need all 3 ;)<br />
<br />
still be interested in your comments on the above mobs though :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Saruton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Rallius Rattican is the easiest, one groupable.<br />
<br />
Vahkshiz isnt hard either but i would go with two groups.<br />
<br />
Junkbeast is amiss, at least on Sol Ro. Never seen it pop in quite some time now. Once it was up and it was somewhere behind the factory stated by a ranger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grimknot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Killed JB many times on Sol Ro.  He's still around, just dies pretty quick.  He's easily 2 groupable.  AE blinds, easily countered with nightmare hides from Fear or casters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Did JB recently.  He does in fact have PHs.  Kill trash past the factory until you spawn him.  Did pretty easily with one group.  Me, cleric, bard, wiz, wiz, and rogue.  Healing blind is awesome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Heh time to dig out the nightmare hides heheheh.<br />
<br />
I actually have one somewhere.  Maybe I shouldn't sell it after all.<br />
<br />
Friend is camping junk beast now, I'll need that to help her with the fight.<br />
<br />
-Bolas</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lzert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">junk beast one groupable if you ready for him...<br />
<br />
clear a side room and pull him into it... i've killed with 65sk, shm, clr, mag, war, enc<br />
<br />
His blind sucks, but he doesn't put out huge damage... pull him into a side room so no adds and it even easier.</div></div><hr />
