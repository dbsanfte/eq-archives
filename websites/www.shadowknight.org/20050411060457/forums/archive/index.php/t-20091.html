<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vigher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">While solo'ing using the  kite method (either fear or aggro style), I often founnd myself guessing when to recast my darkness spell.  I created a hotkey that might be usefull to others<br />
<br />
/cast 1 - (spell slot you have darkness mem'd)<br />
/pause 450 - (this will time 45secs)<br />
/1 45 seconds left (You must creat a private channel for this command to work)<br />
/pause 300<br />
/1 CAST DARKNESS NOW!!!<br />
<br />
Rinse and repeat<br />
<br />
*Note - while using this all other hotkeys will become disabled untill the last line (/1 CAST DARKNESS NOW!!).  If you fizzle you must click the spell gem, reclicking the hotkey will not work</div></div><hr />

I'm usually pretty good with guestimating when it will wear off, and if I'm not particularly on some night, the mob hurtling toward me at breakneck pace usually tips me off.</div></div><hr />

Question; Did your mom spit you out a dumbass, or did you learn that all on your own?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, he's right.  After a while you just know.  Same when I used to play  my enchanter.  I'd have a mez refresh land less than a second after the old one wore, or I'd refresh buffs just as the old ones wore without explicitly timing them.<br />
<br />
I'd think a better way, if you have problems timing, is to not disable your hotykeys with a long ass macro, but to just hit a /time hotkey every now and again knowing how long your spells last.<br />
<br />
Kudos for the witty insults though!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Noguut</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I know its stupid, but I use a kitchen timer when I cast dark.  I set the timer for 1.5 mins to give me time for 2-3 casts on resist.  Its old-school but it is tried and true.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Precisely the point I was trying to make, Catharsis.<br />
<br />
I guess some people just aren't quite as swift as their great &quot;your mom&quot; insults might seem to suggest.<br />
<br />
Oh, and thanks for the great lesson in hotkey creation Vigher.  You know, I played 65 whole levels and didn't know how to cast, pause, or send a message to a chat channel with a hotkey.<br />
<br />
Any other gems of wisdom you care to share with the class, or are you just a one trick whore?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Over time people develop timing to casting. Kind of like waking up a few minutes before your alarm goes off in the morning. <br />
<br />
I would never consider make a hotkey to time snare. I mean... that just seems silly.. You just have to resnare before it wears off, it's not that hard.. is it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Luxem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I hope this tip helps,<br />
   I usually only worry about snare timing to be careful when aggro kiting in the planes, I know my darkness has a 2 minute duration, and I try to use my blood of pain dot, which is 36 sec. duration. I know that after 3 casts of my dot, its probably a good time to refresh my snare. Nice and easy, and not too much of a waste of mana by overcasting my snare. ...BUT, better safe than sorry, if you have a feeling snare may drop soon, just cast early... can't hurt (but the snare dropping may LOL).</div></div><hr />

There was that one other trick I showed you last night....don't you remember practicing tickling my taint with your nose while licking my balls?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Oooh, another sweet dig.<br />
<br />
I guess you won't be able to come up with any more tonight, since it's 4:30 eastern and the bus has probably already dropped you off at home, but be sure to surf on back here during your advanced comp class tomorrow and let us know what you heard on the way to school....<br />
<br />
<br />
Really, guy, lose the attitude and the venom.  You came here like some happy hippy fuck and decided to let all of us idiots in on a way to not only keep track of timing on a spell that most of us can gauge mentally anyway but also how to lock up our hotkeys indefinitely.  Then you got pissed when I pointed out how stupid it was to do that and started flinging what I can only categorize as &quot;the lamest schoolbus insults ever&quot;.<br />
<br />
While you may think that you're cool and dark and evil, and that you're ever so special and smart... what your mom tells you when she tucks you in really doesn't hold water here.  So shut the fuck up, read, listen and learn something, and maybe you'll eventually be able to contribute something worth-while and actually earn that respect you're so desperately trying to force.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Vigher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Read my original post, I stated that it was something I thought others might find useful.<br />
<br />
To come to the  &quot;Combat &amp; Tactics&quot; thread and rip a suggestion makes no sense, you have to be a complete f'ing moron.<br />
<br />
So, keep trying to forget that you were concieved by mistake from your mom's &quot;ONE&quot; wild night of beastiality.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Read the overwhelming response of folks who have been around a lot longer than you have.<br />
<br />
No one finds it useful. It's a poor way of timing your spells.  The reason it's a poor way of timing your spells is that it locks the rest of your hotkeys on execution.  If you'd come here, instead, and asked what was the best way to time your spells so that those of little brain could keep track of exactly when they needed to refresh them, I'm sure you would have received much more amiable responses.  <br />
<br />
Instead, you came here all full of joy that you'd figured out something that every other Shadowknight (or player of any class, for that matter) hadn't thought of in three years.  You essentially wanted to be a big man, and it backfired.  You didn't get the response that you were looking for, and now you're mad.<br />
<br />
So in order to shorten this back and forth considerably, allow me to play it out for you.<br />
<br />
You'll respond to this post with another insult and some very weak attempt to justify your thinking that it might be useful.  Probably something like &quot;Well, not everyone has been playing this game for three years and some of those people might have found it useful&quot;.  I (or someone else who has been around the block a few times) will respond with the logic that, even if there are people reading this board who are really curious about how to time their spells (people who really do need help with this), your method is flawed and isn't really a good way of doing so.  You'll post back that you've been using this method since you were a wee little lad, and it has always been fine for you.  You'll insinuate that those of us who think it's a piss poor way of doing things must be too stupid or too gimp to make it work for us.  You'll throw another insult and storm off in a huff.  There will be a couple of obligatory &quot;Ooh, yeah, I just started and I think this is a great way of doing things&quot; type posts, and a couple more &quot;There's stupid-juice in the water, Alice&quot; type posts.  Then someone will probably come around who has parsed exactly how much more inefficient your way is, and they'll post the results of that parse.  A few more folks will chime in with varying degrees of asinine opinion, then you'll make your way back here and post one last ditch effort to convince everyone you were just trying to help, and that you're &quot;sorry [you're] not as uber as some of [us] arrogant pricks.&quot;  You'll throw one or two more insults, probably either having to do with my mother and her sexual exploits or how sad I (and the others who have picked you apart) are because we get joy out of smashing the hopes and dreams of the simple folk.  You might even go on a mini-tirade about how this game isn't so important to you that you feel the need to spend valuable &quot;IRL&quot; time parsing and being a grammar/search/spelling/parsing nazi.  You'll finish by pretending not to care about this thread or the rest of SKO anymore, and go off somewhere to nurse your wounds.  Most of us will have forgotten about you and your outbursts already, as this thread will have moved to the bottom of page 8.<br />
<br />
So let's just skip all that and accept that you think I'm a raging, illegitimately-concieved, foul-mouthed, bad-tempered asshole, and I think you are a fucking moron.  We can leave it at that and spare the rest of the community the drama, hrmmm?</div></div><hr />

Yeah...  I'm being a dick and discouraging others from posting their ideas and opinions...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Oberyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">... there's an easy way to make a darkness timer, if you find one useful.   One that doesn't lock up your hotkeys at all, which is a really bad thing.<br />
<br />
Go to EQinterface.com, do a search on TIMER.  There is one there that is an easy, small, elegant, unobtrusive mod to your UI.<br />
It replaces a window of your choice (I picked feedback, seeing as the pricks never look at em anyway:P).  This way, patches never affect the timer at all.<br />
<br />
You can have up to 14 separate timers?  something like that: it's lots.  Hell you could time every single spell you have... if that turns your crank.  I have one set up as a spawn timer, and also one for 2 mins for darkness, which only comes out if I'm agro kiting something that makes me feel really squishy, and runs fast.<br />
<br />
*shrug*  hell of a lot better than locking up your UI for 2 mins, IMHO.<br />
