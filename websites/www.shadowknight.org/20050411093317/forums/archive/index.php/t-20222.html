<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Matrix_Chicken273</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all, quick question here: when it comes to soloing, can a beastlord solo better than an SK, or vice versa? I currently have an ikky SK (lvl 6:rolleyes: ) and a lvl 26 ikky BST. MY beastlord has trouble soloing than my SK, which doesn't even has spells yet and can solo. Now, I am aware that my 2 chars are 20 lvls apary, so soloing is much different at later lvls. So basically, whose the better soloer? Please post your answers here, and WHY ( it drives me nuts when people give my answers like &quot;SK is better&quot;, I want to know what class is better and why :D <br />
<br />
Thanks ahead of time :D :D :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Talonmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Don't base the soloability of a SK based on your experiences below level 9.  ANY class will have a better time soloing at level 6 than at 26.<br />
<br />
I find it more fun and easier to solo with the BL because I am not dependent on fear kiting (which I loath) and I get to play tank/offtank/healer depending on my mood while my pet tears though things.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you are looking to play with yourself, stick to the BL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Matrix_Chicken273</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">thx for info, so based on all the melee/hybrid classes, would bst be the best choice? Also my beastlord has like ... barely any HP or dmg... I'm gonna post up my megelo in a few minutes, so you can look at his horrible equipment:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dkhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Beastlords are sick. Just sick. They are so strong it makes me jealous, which then turns to hatred for all beastlords and their fat assed pets. Which brings me to the next subject, pet ass. Why can't they make beastlord pets transparent or something so I can move through them, there's nothing worse than engaging a mob and someone stuns it and it goes moving away from you and you can't move because of some fat ass, stupid pet butt locking you in its cheeks. WTF.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tymor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I play a shadowknight, my wife plays a beastlord.  Both level 57.  She solos far far better then I do.  Shadowknight soloing is very gear and/or situation dependant.  You need space to fearkite, if you go toe to toe solo then your sucess will depend on your gear.  For the beastlord they have slows, good buffs and a solid pet.  The pet tanks better then the beastlord, so they often play pet cleric.  Letting the pet tank, beastlord sits back slows, dots and heals pet as needed.  If you want a solo class but don't want to play pet cleric then you may want to look at shaman.  The rest of the really good solo classes are pet classes, and have their pet do the tanking.  Shaman actually tank when soloing at higher levels, and just use their pet as added damage.  With their slows and effecient heals they do very well toe to toe with a mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>DConquest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">SKs suck at solo'ing at the high end game since their Mana regen and DPS is severly cut.  We pretty much have 52 ish Necro DPS minus some of the mana regen, more hp / ac, and the ability to land spells on the mobs.   If we could fear higher lvl mobs, then we'd fare much better... and even then we wouldn't be up there in the Solo'ing class ladder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vincente</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">They dont even compare...  A naked BL could solo blues at 65, most SKs will have trouble soloing LBs post 60...<br />
<br />
<br />
BLs have cleric-efficient pet heals to go along with their warrior-HPed pets with excellent DPS, they can 65% slow, they have good solo spells like regrowth, haste, and buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Arikash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yeah, BST&gt;SK solo wise, at any lvl post 15 imo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>UGLA</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Funny how lots of classes can solo mobs sk's can't kill but the sk's can solo the classes that can solo the mobs :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Vincente</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thats because those soloers depend on the mob's lack of intelligence to beat them. i.e. mobs beat on the pet instead of its master, they keep running after the soloer in circles etc</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kuvak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">That, and lifetaps and harm's touch have much greater importance in PVP than against mobs. HT is fine in duels cause you only have to kill 1 target. PVE, you generally don't use HT unless fighting a boss mob, which has SO many hp that HT barely dents it. Lifetaps do a nice bit of hurt against players because player hp is far less than mobs as well.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ajrarn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I got a 65 sk (my main) and a 56 bst (bad ass twink lot of ornate ...). <br />
<br />
I founded easier and safer to solo with my sk than bst. Bst is not that impressive, no form of CC at all, no pulling skills as well, nice dps but healing pet hurt mana badly and crappy heal for himself.<br />
<br />
Pre pop, I soloed from 50 to 60 + AA with my sk without any problems at any places, owned named with HT... BST solo xp is a bit faster but you can't solo everywhere and you don't have the sk burst dmg for hard hitting mobs.<br />
<br />
BST is still a fun class to play, but it's far more efficient in group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">yah bst really aren't impressive at all in pvp, best situation they and there pet = another melee on a target and provide a decent chance of stunning targets without high avoidance. Worse case they are alone and fighting they get someone to 30% and the person runs off and heals. Thats the nice thing about being an sk we make good finishers due to snare (never lands higher end and if somehow it does the highend players have 100k horses which nullify snare) lifetaps (a dd that lands!) and dots to finish off a runner (if they land)<br />
<br />
If i get an situation 3boxing where i have to pvp (sk,clerics,bst) i most the time find myself hitting DA on cleric casting chaining anull's at the same time as sk+cleric+bst sicking pet then just switching to the sk to hope to finish the person off before they kill my cleric.<br />
<br />
Had an ex-guildie ranger trying to grief me bout a month ago where i did that same thing chain anulls then used all the dots on bst and sk to kill the ranger while he ran off to heal for the 6th time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Dakkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">SKs can aggro kite with pet, beastlords can't.<br />
<br />
At the high end not getting hit &gt; &gt; getting hit, though well equipped beastlords can do amazing things.  Beyond a certain easily-reached level though, mobs do so much damage you can't afford to get hit at all.<br />
<br />
But neither class is really regarded as a soloing class by the likes of necros and druids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Winkles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Actually bst can aggro kite.  A couple of the pet procs have decrease hate on them.  Bst can also use a limited form of fear kiting using blind.  Lvl 61 bst dot does 146 per tick and gets alot of aggro so pet can actually aggro kite.  Instead of snaring though you just run from mob since you have sow or back up if you can out run it that way.<br />
<br />
I can tell you from experience that at lvl 53 I could solo the Lady D in Dulak and clear the boat just as the next one popped with my bst.  With kei it is so easy it is boring.  There is no way I could do that with my sk at that lvl.  One of the tricks is to keep mobs back to the pet so it can do max damage while you set up a hot key to heal yourself then tab back to mob.  Heal will still land on you and you can continue attack when it lands.  You might take 10 to 15 percent damage from each mob this way.  Then you play pet cleric while you regen hp for a couple mobs and start all over again.<br />
<br />
Shaman are a different story though.  There are mobs I wouldn't even touch as a bst but would do with a shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Reflan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">It really goes back and forth depending on the class versus the mob, a lot of times.  Shaman DPS in general is horrible compared to BST, and BST heals for their pets are great compared to shaman heals, which stink big time once you start fighting mobs toward the end of the game.  Yet when mobs don't summon and can take roots without just constantly breaking their roots, and the shaman has his LDON dots and good AA, a shaman can solo pretty decently stuff that a BST wouldn't want to try.<br />
<br />
And a necro or druid can solo obscenely well.  Druids charming in places like POW for instance can do incredible things.  <br />
<br />
For almost all classes, though, solo experience is so inferior to group experience after a while that when you combine it with how boring soloing can be, it's not compelling at all.  If you make a class dependent too much on how good soloing is, you'll be out of the phase where soloing even matters with almost every class quicker than you thought possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Oberyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">... a 65 SK (myself) and a 65 BST, in the place where I usually hunt:<br />
<br />
I clear about 11-12 blues, and in the same time, the BST clears 14-16.   Single chars.  He straight tanks them (Slowed) and thus has less set-up/pull time per mob.  I fear kite/tank combo.  His pet looks like it has rather nice DPS.  This probably explains the greater numbers.<br />
<br />
In that situation, same mobs, the BST comes out ahead.  I do an AA in approximately 2.5-3 hrs depending on how lazy I feel (interruptions, friends yakking, etc...), so I suspect he would be just over 2 hrs an AA.<br />
<br />
I do however have the option of Tactics or Storms (or wherever)and agro kiting,  and I don't believe its an option for a BST.  I don't enjoy it a lot, and find it more risky for the same return but in that situation, SKs come out ahead.<br />
<br />
In regards to farm/rare soloing, I suspect that BST Slow goes a long way there, though for bigger rares, our HT comes in handy.  *shrug*  not enough experience with the BST's bag of tricks to know who comes out ahead there.<br />
<br />
Just a few observations from watching a similarly equipped BST whilst soloing *shrug*<br />
