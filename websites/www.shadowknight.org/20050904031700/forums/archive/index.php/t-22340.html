<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yabyab</div><div class="date">08-08-2004, 05:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My main is a SK, my alt is a BST and I tried the monk too. I think the SK is not too far from these so called &quot;Dps&quot; classes in terms of DPS. What I have observed is, while playing my BST they have alittle better Spear-Like nukes the only difference from our spears is they have 30 sec recast time, their casting time is 1 sec, and they deal alittle bit more damage (like 50ish more damage). They got just one effecient dot at level 61 (the other ones are like 2+ minutes with 50-60ish damage per tick) but this dot is 140ish damage per tick and its poison based with 110 DD when casted, so its almost like Blood of Hate.<br />
<br />
 I've seen BSTs using 2Handed weapons, and I know their 2HB skill is capped at 225 (like SKs) while they dont get a Double Attack skill (only from Pop AAs) and they dont get (iirc) the 2Handed AAs we get....... does this mean (excluding their pet) SKs should own a BST who's using a 2HB weapon in terms of dPS?!<br />
<br />
 They do have ATK buffs, and so does the SK.. though an SK can get their ATK buff or from a shaman to get the ATK boost..<br />
<br />
 comparing our pet to their pet when both have toys and fully buffed, ID ont think we'll find a big difference in DPS.. so BSTs might out DPS the SK but not alot unless I forgot something, which is why am posting this thread.<br />
<br />
 I believe Monks using 2HB would not be that far from SK DPS since AFAIK their kicks and moves dont do much damage and can be cancelled out by our DOTs/Nukes + Pet.<br />
<br />
 So is it true an SK compared to a BST/Monk using same 2Handed weapon would probably net in more DPS?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Winkles</div><div class="date">08-08-2004, 10:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Plus each time the bst pet procs, which is a whole lot, you have to add in the almost 150damage it does.  I don't really think bst do a whole lot more dps but bst aren't a dps class like a rogue or ranger either.  If you compare our damage to a rogue you will see we don't even compare unless its a real short fight.  My rogue at lvl 53 hit a crit bs of 1222 which is kinda sick for a melee at that lvl.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yabyab</div><div class="date">08-08-2004, 03:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Our pet I believe procs 150dd with mage toys, I might be wrong. With buffs you can raise the stats and can land some hits.. I was parsing our pet was like 25-30 dps (not including procs) and their pet is 35-40 dps. So at max the difference is 10-30dps... if my statistics were correct using 2hb sk should deal more dps than bst so.. the 10-30dps advantage from their pet is neglected. In conclusion, SK is not very far from BST dps not necessary better.<br />
<br />
 But as you say that BSTs arent DPS class thats different. I guess BSTs are solo class + group support?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Winkles</div><div class="date">08-08-2004, 04:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The bst pet must have had been sick or had a cold to be putting out that low of damage.  I think the highest bst pet puts out around 70dps and has a lvl of 63 or 64 with the pet aug.  So they actually land their procs pretty well on higher end mobs.  You can also give the bst pet mage weapons and they will check intate proc then the weapon proc on each swing so they will proc on almost every swing.  But the dps probably isn't that much different with all things taken into account.  The big difference is that a lvl 65 bst can slow a mob by 65% and haste themselves by 50% and pet by 85%.  Bst are a fun class to play cause they are so well rounded as far as group and solo capabilities.  I don't think bst need a nerf bat but it would be nice if all classes were so well rounded.  I think the only real class gripe is the 9 second cast time on the mini cheal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
do you know how many procs our pet lands in a fight?<br />
maybe 1 of 100 attempts. our pet is just too green to land procs on anything that we fight for exp.<br />
<br />
anyway, SKs at the lower end/mid end (when melee DPS doesn't comprise as much of total DPS) can outdamage MOST classes at an equivalent level.<br />
<br />
why?<br />
an okay pet, mental horror/corruption, nukes that don't detract from melee time, or good DoT if fights are long enough.</div></div><hr />
