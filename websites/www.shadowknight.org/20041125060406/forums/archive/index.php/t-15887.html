<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aethor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What, at this stage,  do shadowknights need?<br />
<br />
We're excellent in groups and decent soloers. <br />
<br />
What we need is to stack in raids.  This will increase our desirability to guilds.<br />
<br />
If a guild has 4-5 tanks in MT lineup and 4-8 others for TMing, there is no real need to add more.<br />
<br />
If a guild has 20 wizards, it can add another 20 and they will all stack, to infinity. Similar with all the offensive classes (though melee offensive can get crowded a bit).<br />
<br />
Make an AA skill, should be fairly expensive in terms of aa points, and accessible at 62+ or perhaps 65, that makes Zevfeer's Bite Recourse an AoE spell.<br />
<br />
If you want to make in in stages (1, 2, 3) make level one with AoE range of 25, level 2 with AoE range of 50 and level 3 with AoE range of 100, all other effects should be the same.<br />
<br />
Net effect? For group - nothing. For soloing - nothing. For raids and guild desirability? Awesome. If a guild has 3 SKs, it can add another 3 and they will actually be useful.<br />
<br />
What do you think? Any SOE developer lurking these boards? :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Warmaster Xsavuung Llaahh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I definitely agree with this. Definitely not overpowering in any way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Drakonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Imagine the healing spam on an AEing boss...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ganaith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Mmm, lets get some attention on this thread, this is really an AA most people would kill for :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aethor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Note also that this doesn't affect other classes.<br />
<br />
It does not improve or decrease SK tanking ability, so warriors won't have anything to complain about.<br />
<br />
It does not improve SK dps, so dps classes won't complain - actually, nukers will get a bit more mana which will actually help them.<br />
<br />
Is it overpowering? Only if you bring 15-20 SKs, each with 65 and a ton of aa, to the same raid. Considering how rare SKs are, in comparison to other classes, there is no danger of it happening anytime soon. And anyway it is like nukers - are wizards overpowered if you bring 20 more and then again 20 more to the same raid? Probably. But noone is complaining about that.<br />
<br />
My guild has 2 SKs with 65 and some aas, and tons of clerics, paladins, warriors, monks, wizards, chanters... having 2-3 more SKs on raid won't overpower it in any way.<br />
<br />
Aethor</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Saelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Excellent idea.<br />
<br />
/Feedback time folks.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grumoor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Don't stop with one spell.  Make it so all our group spells can be Area Effect with the purchase of an AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Aethor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Actually it wouild not stack, Grumoor. All other spells have a buff icon and a duration; if you cast AoE Aura of Pain, or Aura of Hate, it won't matter if another SK casts it as well.<br />
<br />
The whole idea is for SKs to stack.<br />
<br />
Zevfeer's Bite is instant (not in cast time, but once you cast it, the effect is instant) and does not leave a buff icon, thus it is AoE stackable perfectly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Xanathol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">/blink<br />
<br />
So, giving 200 hp ( possibly 400 ) and 200 mana to everyone in an area every minuteis gonna make raiding guilds say &quot;hey! we need more SKs!&quot;? Yes, its possible with a large number of SKs that this could be 10000 mana over 5 minutes, but I dunno about you, but on the way to a boss mob, I have never seen a caster lom. Things die too quickly. Most raids, we control who's getting hit, even on trash, so no one should need the heal. And on the boss mob, the fight doesn't last long enough - either it dies or we do. What is the image here? That the whole raid is low on HP &amp; mana, and the 40 or so SKs all ZB at the same time and save the day? =/<br />
<br />
As far as being wanted on raids, lets see. I can mez tank. I can pull. I can take care of myself ( lifetaps, FD, etc ) so I am extremely low maintence, and on the boss mob, I'll blow my HT load on him, enough to make wizzies cringe. I find I am wanted just fine on raids myself.<br />
<br />
If you really want this, you can have it, but I won't be putting AAs into it if it was there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Lejina Bloodbath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Heh, 4-5 SKs on a raid and you are already trivialising the AE from Blazzax the Omnifiend with such AE Zevfeer's.<br />
<br />
No, not overpowered at all :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Aethor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">5 SKs AoEing it would add 100 hp and 50 mana / tick regen, assuming they all recast it every time as soon as it pops. Mana is coming close to overpowering but hp isn't.<br />
<br />
Blazzax does 2k AoE DD, assuming he recasts on 30 sec it is 400/tick on average. In 30 sec with 5 SKs you can get on average 500 hp, or 100/tick. It removes 1/4 of his Aoe effectively... not really trivializing. Just helpful. (Data is from Allakhazam; I haven't fought him yet). You would need 15-20 SKs to trivialize it, which won't happen.<br />
<br />
Any AE that is trivialized by mere 100 hp/tick regen, was trivial to begin with. Use Bond of Death, you got 80 hp/tick as it is, with any regen buff and your natural regen you will have 100/tick without problems. Ok, other classes don't have such lifetaps? Every wis caster can heal himself even better. For others, MGB elixir and that solves the problem.<br />
<br />
Two days ago I was fighting Cursed (grats me on Goldenrod :) ), and we were being hit with his poison AE DoT that is next to unresistable (got close to 400 buffed PR and was still hit most of the time) and it does 500 damage/tick.<br />
<br />
So 5 * SKs would decrease it to 400/tick. Still a pain in the ass. I don't see how that would be overpowered. <br />
<br />
<br />
People, please compare this to wizards. Are wizards not overpowered in quantities? You can stack them till they single shot any mob, is that not overpowered? Ok, single shot is more of a theoretical thing, but you got the idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Lejina Bloodbath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Heh, you compare a single spell to a whole class to support your claim that this spell is not overwered?<br />
<br />
This single spell is not as powerful as this whole class, thus its not overpowered. This is comical. <br />
<br />
While you're at it, what about the SKs?! Arent they overpowered in quantities? Heck, you need a hell of a lot less SKs than Wizards to one shot something! Nerf us!<br />
<br />
That's a great argument you got there.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, and no, any AE trivialised by a 100hp/tick regen is not trivial to begin with. You obviously dont realise it, but this is a ton of healing at no cost whatsoever.<br />
<br />
MGB EE and MGB Spirit of the Wood are limited by the use of the MGB ability and they dont stack (EE dont stack with EE and SotW dont stack with SotW i mean). Your MGB Zevfeer's would be virtually constant on the whole raid party all the time and all the SKs stack on each others.<br />
<br />
Currently the power of Zevfeer's is limited by the number of SKs you can have in a single group and only the individuals in this group get its benefits. By making it an AE you increase its powers by wicked scales.<br />
<br />
One single SK casting the current Zevfeer's = up to 1200hp/600mana per minute.<br />
<br />
One single SK casting your Zevfeer's (considering a 72 memebrs raid party) = up to 14400hp/7200mana per minute.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Aethor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I am comparing a class to a class, not a spell to a class. The fact is that offensive classes stack far better than the defensive ones. And what we need is, therefore, to stack better.<br />
<br />
Yes, takes less SKs to one shot a mob than wizards. Once in a long time, because of HT refresh. Wizards just keep nuking. So that's not really a comparison.<br />
<br />
But what is the most important is that this was an idea to discuss about. If there are flaws, then if you can think of an enhancement, post it. Why do you reject the idea outright? It was not supposed to be perfect from the beginning. Isn't the meaning of this forum to discuss suggestions?<br />
<br />
For example, the spell could give decreased amount of mana to people who aren't in group with SKs who is casting it, like one half or less.<br />
<br />
And/or it could depend on distance from the caster.<br />
<br />
Refresh timer can also be adjusted.<br />
<br />
You could even make it pingpong like WC3 mass healings, the spell hits up to X friendly targets (for example group only), then from then a second recourse goes that hits up to X other people but for half, from them a third recoourse that hits for one quarter mana and hp.<br />
Basically getting weaker as it goes around, and limit it to 3 or 4 branchings.<br />
<br />
Or any other idea.<br />
<br />
Do you see how many possibilities are there? I just gave the basic idea, developers can work something on that basis, and players can propose their ideas how this could be enhanced and/or balanced, to keep stacking but lose overpowering.<br />
<br />
Do not reject things outright before you think of possibilities, please.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Stryph</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Good lord, think of the heal spam you'd get on a 72 man raid...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>JoebSK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Maybe make it a 10-15min reuse and work with all group taps, allow necro's to use it to. To be able to MGB heal every minute would be overpowered, of course it would be nice if we got a couple more really nice group tap type spells if we got this ability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Darkreapyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">humm an aa that you could reuse every 15mins or so that would make any spell ae for sks would be cool,  we could have ae tuant then =) ae cd, or terror. Prolly some spell that would make it really overpowering that im not thinking of though</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>dzenith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">c5 + Bard song + FT15 = 18 + 20 + 15 = 53 mana/tic <br />
<br />
5 sk's with ZB = 50 mana/tick<br />
<br />
Please rethink your view that nearly doubling the mana regen of a raid would be an acceptable power gain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Hollenritter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I'd rather see one sk in every group.<br />
<br />
Gotta agree, this would be overpowering.<br />
<br />
However, allowing some of the ac/atk taps to be ae might be interesting.  But then you hit the buffslot problem again.<br />
<br />
*shrug*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Makkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">hmm..it's definitely an interesting idea imo. BL's mbg paragon &amp; SD line is pretty damn useful compared to what sk bring (aside from offtanking.) Actually, I'd like to hear an arguments that BL's -aren't- overpowered now. MGB paragan, SD, 65% slow - at lvl 60 shammy slow is only 70%, it only scales up to 75% - imo slow has been broken from day one (75% at lvl 52 wtf) - like cheal (7500 at lvl 39, cuz all tanks have that many hp at that level). Plus bst have -real- high DPS. They are supposedly hybrids, heh.<br />
<br />
Pallies get group heals, who gives a fuck. Nice for AoE's. Recast on zevfeers is too long to be nearly useful for aoes in groups. Some kind of AA that allows stackable zevfeers every 10 minutes or so wouldn't exactly be overpowering.<br />
<br />
Personally I'm pretty happy off tanking / pulling occasionally. Unfortunately I don't have enough AA (or levels) to compete with some of the other pally hybrids in my guild, and usually end up being asked to bring nec anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kahntun Derstand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Lol, could you imagine all of the experience groups that would huddle around Shadow Knight groups if this went in?<br />
<br />
As it stands, this idea sounds cool.  However, it would be totally overpowered.  The only thing they could even put in like this would be some low chance that it would be AE and not just group.  If they put something like that in, I doubt many would really take the time to get it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Ganaith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Give us MGB, and let zefeer fire off with it should solve it, shouldnt it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Silence</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">they could put a timer on its stacking... like with  the donals bp cheal or the wizard mb... you can recast it till the timer wears off that sorta deal...  make it 10 -15 minutes... 200 hp / 100 mana every 15 minutes... thats not so bad...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Drynnious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Thus making it so it leaves a buff, and making it so a spell with a 1 minute recast can only be cast every 15 minutes.<br />
<br />
Scratch that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Silence</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">well, it'd only work that way with the mass skill cept that might be a little too much wishful thinking  on soe's coding department... <br />
<br />
other than that i think we're fucked on being aoers less they gave us a new spell / skill for it... kinda like paragon  maybe call it  Zevfeer's  Fang or something  make it 200 hps / 100 mana a tic for 3 tics   and give it a 15 minute reuse...  that way we'd have bite for groups and fang for raids  and they'd  ..hmm... i dont think they'd go for that /shrug maybe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Roril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Ok guys.....lets all put our heads together and think.....<br />
Exactly how useful would this be?<br />
What high end raid mobs do u know that wont resist ZB?<br />
I try to ZB almost all raid mobs and always have very little success. AoE ZB would only help with maybe clearing mobs and helping the raid to regen mana faster during clearing so u dont have some n00b oom clerics right before u engage.<br />
The only way this would be very useful is if they made an improved ZB like the imporved HT....making it unresistable but makeing a reuse time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Drakonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Don't know what zones you raid Roril, but Zevfeer's lands on near enough everything I raid.  Only mobs it dosen't land on are CoD mobs (disease immune, and I havent raided there for a looong time)... and some LDoN raid mobs we tried out yesterday, of which most seemed disease immune.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Roril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Well....i know that it either wont land or it will rarely land on any BoT tower rare...burrower....AoW...shei...IV...tmax...AL...tunare and like u said...CoD mobs<br />
Only mobs that i can think of that dont resist often are AD and mid range velious stuff....like dain and yelinak....but as far as high end luclin / velious mobs go.....they resist mine almost all the time.....also if u are 65 and u have the AAs to spare odds are u will be gettin HT and horse and fun stuff like that or go for defensive if u dont wanna have fun.....but by the time most SKs would put any AAs into this they will be raiding mobs that resist it consistantly imo.<br />
<br />
sure u will land an ocasional ZB on a raid mob but in my experiance it doesnt land often.<br />

Not sure why you are having problems, but it works and lands all the time on mobs in PoFire/PoWater/PoAir/PoEarth, EarthB.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Roril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I guess i must have bad luck then.....although i can land it on mobs....it takes a few casts til it lands. like a 10min fight i can cast ZB 10 times and it will land maybe 1-2 times for me on mobs i have been raiding recently.

<br />
Off the top of my head Id say make its re use time equal to double or triple of the re use time of the spell, something to that effect.  If we pre emptive nerf it in conceptual stage perhaps we can miss the in game one.  *shrug*<br />
