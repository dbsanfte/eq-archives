<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Bah!  Stupid admins freaking deleted the thread and then banned me for the info posted.  Funny thing is that there isn't anything in the shadowknight.org rules that prohibits it.  Heck, if you have a problem with it, then how about deleting the post and sending an email (come on guys, there's got to be some reason you insist on having our email addresses) explaining that you don't want information posted and warn that I could be banned?<br />
<br />
Kinda pisses me off.  Especially considering that I have been on these boards for over 3 years (yeah, all the way back to when it was combined with the ranger and shaman boards), and then they decide that because I posted information.  Freaking idiots didn't even email me to explain that I was banned and why.<br />
<br />
And no, although I have access to information, I didn't sign up on beta, and I didn't agree to the non-disclosure agreement.</div></div><hr />

Whats that about no rules against it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ok, so it's mentioned in the Arena (a forum that I don't visit at all), and it wasn't in the agreement that you make when you make an account.  As such, it still seems that a warning would be in order first.  Oh well, they own the boards, they can do whatever they want and be as fair or unfair as they choose to be.<br />
<br />
Oh, and although that first one was posted before my posts, the second one was post ex facto, so doesn't really count.  Besides, realisticially the forum rules should be part of the agreement when you make an account.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't have had a problem with the posts being deleted and being given a warning, but what's up with the one strike, you're out thing?  Especially against someone that has been on the boards as long as you have?  *That* is the part I have a problem with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Saruton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Just a question. What is against the NDA of GoD Beta ? Posting screenshots of new zones shouldnt be as those are accessible by everyone especially by those that didnt agreed to any NDA. So why is someone banned if he posts something tha SoE just gives out to everyone ?</div></div><hr />
