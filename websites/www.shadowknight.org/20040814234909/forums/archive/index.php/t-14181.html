<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Saruton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Emperor key:<br />
Get a pouch from one of the taskmasters or Warden Mekush in the Basement of Ssra, get Zazuh's Idol of the Commander Zazuh, who can spawn on the first floor anywhere. Get Zeruzh's Ring from Commander Zeruzsh, who can spawm anywhere on the second floor. And get a Ssrazean insignia from any of the named right befor the Entrance to Emperor's Room, who are called Arbiter Korazhk, General Kizuhx and Advisor Zekuzh. Combine the items in the pouch and you have the key.<br />
<br />
VT Key:<br />
Go to Akheva. Just north of the IV there is a room, with an altar like thing on the north wall. There are 4 sacrificial remains spawning. Kill them one by one untill a shimmering presence spawns. Give it a wisp stone -summoned by a mage- and it will turn into the Spirit of Akelha'Ra. Give one Essence Emerald to him and he will give you the Sceptre of Akelha'Ra Frame. Now you need to finish this sceptre. First you need 10 Lucid Shards dropped all over Luclin.<br />
<br />
1.: Fungus Grove from Shik`Nar Warriors and Royals, sometimes said to drop from Soldiers too but verry rarely. Easy soloable.<br />
<br />
2.: Akheva Ruins from Xi Vius, Shadow Reavers, and Shade Golems. Soloable<br />
<br />
3.: The Grey from Sun Revenants near the Lake. Soloable<br />
<br />
4.: Sanctus Seru from A Legionnaire of the Hand, or Legionnaires on the top area of the zone. Soloable<br />
<br />
5.: Dawnshroud Peaks from Rockhoppers/Sambata in and near the cave. Soloable<br />
<br />
6.: The Deep from Thought Horrors and Thought Leeches, any but Young. Probably soloable but easier and  more fun with a group behind the invis bridge. Combine this taks with some Seru Bane component farming.<br />
<br />
7.: The Scarlet Desert from Sun Revanants and Reavers on the Plateau. Soloable<br />
<br />
8.: Maiden's Eye from named Goranga. Soloable but better Duo up to get more camp spots for you.<br />
<br />
9.: Acrylia Cavern from grimlings in Inner Acrylia after the revamp. Duo with healer.<br />
<br />
10.: Ssraeshza Temple from Skeletons in the Mines. Get a group and clear the mines.<br />
<br />
Now combine those 10 Shards in the Frame and you get a two slot container. Fill it with a glowing orb of luclinite and a Rift which drops from green mobs that spawn after the death of the emperor and you have you VT Key.</div></div><hr />
