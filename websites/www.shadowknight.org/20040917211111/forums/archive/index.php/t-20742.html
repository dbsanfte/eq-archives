<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Darkhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I run two eq accounts (2 box) and i decided to create an sk/shammy combo. I made an ogre sk and it seems fine to lvl 13, but before i get too far down the road i would like to ask the opinions of this body if there are any major differences between the races of sk's in high end play. I understand troll regen, DE/erudite int, ogre sta/str, etc..., but what i really want to know is if any of it makes that much difference at lvl 60 or is it just personal pref? My fav race is DE, but i dont want to get to 60 and wish i had an ogre. Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ogres have the advantage of stun immunity from the front, trolls and iksars have the regeneration, and dark elves look the best by far. :D<br />
<br />
In the end it doesn't really matter that much, but there are always those that say the immunity to stun from the front is quite useful.  I could never bring myself to play an ogre for more than about 15 minutes, so I really couldn't say.</div></div><hr />

Not really, but DE Sk's are a dime a dozen stick with the ogre if you got him started, really that's the only racial trait that still holds value.  But remember, it's unstunable by MELEE from the front.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I made an Ogre and have always been pleased. Since I tend to tank alot, I am happy for the immunity to melee stun. If I had planned on not tanking as much I would have made a troll for the regen or a DE for the cool look and int.<br />

I dumped all my skill points int (actually 5 went into AGI).</div></div><hr />

yes, shes one of those good examples of why human sks rule</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>nimic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'd say, as an ogre, stay away from being an Ogre unless you really, really want to be an ogre.  Getting stuck all the time sucks, taking up the space of 3 normal toons sucks, getting stuck sucks, and getting stuck sucks :D.  Lower intelligence means your skills will advance more slowly then our intelligent breathren, and you will not have as large a mana pool.  Last but not least, there is a hefty experience penalty for playing an Ogre - about 15% I believe.<br />
<br />
On the positive side, we look intimidating as hell, have very high innate stamina, and are unstunnable by melee from the front.<br />
<br />
End game, you are left with one pro and one con.  You will still be unstunnable from the front by melee, and you will still be a fat ass.   The Ogre unstunnability is not really a big factor at 60+... I still get stunned by the LDON traps, and it seems like every other POP mob procs a stun with their melee attacks.<br />
<br />
Play an ogre because you want too, as they have little advantage end game.  If your looking to PL your way to end game, the 15% penalty might hamper your progress a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Darkhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">That last post made me think a bit for sure. I didnt start and ogre cuz i really wanted to be an ogre. I love DE's, but feared some dramatic let down in their ability to tank at high levels. I have a lvl 65 DE SK in my guild who rocks, but I just needed verification. Thanks for all the input--ill be rerolling tonight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Rukgut</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Post 60, with all the AA's and such, there's no real difference between the classes.  Personally, from 1-60 I loved my Ogre SK.  Still do.  Bottom line: play what you prefer, because in the end in all pretty much balances out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>eansdad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Ogre's and DE's are everywhere. Try a Gnome SK. In the end though it's upto you what you'd like. If you do go Erudite there is a nice sword that drops from a ghost near the Guardian of the Seal that is SK/Eru only. Not a bad sword and usually rots.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Arikash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Go Gnome!!  I made an Ogre first, then I decided that I didn't wanna deal with the faction in lower lvls, and also I don't like being a big huge fat ass who will get stuck everywhere.  Also I didn't wanna go with the crowd for looks and tanking ability.  Another thing is its funny when you get a group, the person is spinning around, then you have to say &quot;down&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Cirulik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">IKSAR <br />
<br />
Best Lore....and if you start Greenmist at level5, the quest will take care of most of your leveling for you..............<br />
<br />
The whole storyline of the Iksar being slaves of the Shissar, then taking over Norrath, only being defeated by a coalition of the Dragons and others with a final flaming battle on flying mounts, and all the crumbling statues from the combine and old decaying Iksar cities with the guardian statues at the entries (some underwater in surprising places...), is just way more than anyone else has.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Toothfairy_TP</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">End game size isnt an issue...with anizoks minimizing device or some of the clicky items..<br />
Mana shouldnt be a problem either with c5 or pact and Mental corrupt ( MC I dont use much unless Im in a group and theres no c5 and Im using pact)<br />
<br />
It all comes down to what you like .....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Jagdwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Lizi's start with such high &quot;gifts&quot; that they are good in the low end, at the high end they are so very slow to lvl.<br />
<br />
However, the over all stat combo's make them the absolute best.  Add in the regen and bang you have a super toon.<br />
<br />
Also, never let anyone tell you that a SK is a tank.  Well a non Ogre SK any way.  I  am currently a lvl 61 Lizi sk, with 28 aa's well placed in needed AA areas.  I have solo a vast majority of my toons life.  I am a caster first and have geared my equip. to this fact.  I currenly have 3700 mana and my aa combo of Improved life taps, spell crits and mana regen on top of normal regen means I can run down the spear line of spells, dark a mob arse, dot it with a vampiric spell and have mental corruption running with Life Leach and Drain soul and can pretty much not need a cleric for a vast majority of a fight.  Also a Improved Damage IV item does not hurt!<br />
<br />
Regen is a great item, front stun is ok, but to be honest a good SK should never draw agro.  I have 2 sets of weapons now,  and though at any time I can take agro from a 65 warrior, I chose not to take agro with one weapon choice or to take agro with a 2nd weapon choice.  <br />
<br />
Life bites for a mob that a warrior is getting the snot beat out of him and your in the back casting your butt off and &quot;tanking&quot;  only to get hit a couple of time till the warrior takes back the agro and then you crit tap the mob and heal yourself.<br />
<br />
Ah the true meaning of Shadow Knight.  Never been seen while you are cutting their heart out and then healing yourself with their life.  Oh and laughing your arse off as a warrior works it trying to keep agro and here you are doggin that warrior with a simple attention getter.<br />
<br />
Lifes good....especially when your tapping it from a mob.  Nothing like free life.<br />

<br />
Just to clear up the confusion... ogres don't tank any better than any other race.<br />
<br />
Their front stun resistance is immunity to melee stuns only.<br />
<br />
It doe's nothing for the stuns that really matter, which are are procs or spells.</div></div><hr />
