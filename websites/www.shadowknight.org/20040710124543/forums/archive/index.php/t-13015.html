<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Platinum Disc goes in the charm slot.  I recently obtained one and tested it by moving platinum between my account and my wife's account.  Here's what I found.<br />
<br />
With this amount (in thousands of platinum pieces) in bank, it had these stats:<br />
<br />
0k no stats<br />
5k +1 hp +1 mana<br />
10k +3 hp +3 mana +1 fr +1 cr<br />
15k +1 dex +4 hp +4 mana +1 fr +1 cr<br />
20k +1 dex +6 hp +6 mana +2 fr +2 cr<br />
25k +1 dex +5 hp +5 mana +1 fr +1 cr<br />
30k +3 hp +3 mana +1 fr +1 cr                                              <br />
40k no stats<br />
60k +1 dex +5 hp +5 mana +1 fr +1 cr<br />
80k +1 hp +1 mana<br />
416k +1 dex +3 hp +3 mana +1 fr +1 cr<br />
<br />
For an item that says &quot;improves as you accumulate more total wealth&quot; it seems to work just fine as you go from 0 plat to 20k plat.. but at values over 20k, seems to be broken and assign a fairly random value to the charm for a given wealth level.  Clearly bugged, IMHO.  <br />
<br />
I'm guessing that there is some programming variable that doesn't have sufficient length in the definition to allow for numbers much over 20,000 plat, and that above those values of wealth it gives a random result.  <br />
<br />
There's no way that you should have decent stats at 20k and no stats whatsoever with twice that much money if it's supposed to IMPROVE when you get more wealth.<br />
<br />
Please fix this bug Verant!!  Thanks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Did some more testing. At 19,999 plat 9 gold 9 silver 9 copper, it was +1 dex +5 hp +5 mana +1 fr +1 cr. <br />
<br />
Adding one more copper takes it to an even 20,000 plat and gives +1 dex +6 hp +6 mana +2 fr +2 cr. <br />
<br />
It stays the same, as far as I can tell, for all values between 20,000 plat and 22,949 plat. <br />
<br />
At 22,949 plat 6 gold 7 silver 2 copper it's still +1 dex +6 hp +6 mana +2 fr +2 cr. But adding one more copper causes the stats to decrease, when it gets to 22,949 plat 6 gold 7 silver 3 copper it goes back down to +1 dex +5 hp +5 mana +1 fr +1 cr. <br />
<br />
Lame. <br />
<br />
Sounds like verant is suffering from a &quot;variable out of bounds&quot; type problem, where their algorithm used to calculate the stats of the Platinum Disc is buggy when it gets values over 22949672 total wealth (measured in coppers).  Time to fix the bug.  Bug report filed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">With 675,000 plat in the bank, stats are +3 hp +3 mana +1 fr +1 cr.  Very disappointing.  Hope they get this fixed soon.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Drynnious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">do you feel like you are talking to yourself in this thread?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yep sure do.<br />
<br />
Still broken after the most recent patch.  Fix it please.<br />
<br />
-Bolas</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Got one last night too. Really easy to get.<br />
<br />
Yes please fix it. Seems that a lot of the charms are bugged.<br />
<br />
I will /bug this as well Bolas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Wonder if this was fixed in today's patch?<br />
<br />
What really bothers me is seeing what the stats SHOULD be on magelo, and comparing them to what they actually are when equipped.  Someone owes me 7 dex 25 hp 9 fr 9 cr.<br />
<br />
I would love to see this get fixed sometime soon... wonder if they read the bug reports or not?  I'd think this wouldn't be THAT tough of a bug to troubleshoot for this charm given the nature of the charm, the repeatability of the bug, and the sheer level of detail provided in the bug reports filed.<br />
