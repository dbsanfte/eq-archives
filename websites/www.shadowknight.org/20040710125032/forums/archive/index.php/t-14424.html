<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thingiemethong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I normally don't use my walking dot ( pet ) much.. untill I started doing the Chardock Faction quests..  ( http://how.to/chardok ) <br />
<br />
It's easy to let the pet kick the living Sh*t out of the greenies while I med..  <br />
<br />
What I've seen now is that when I FD and go AFK for a couple minute's..   the pet poofs after a couple minutes.. <br />
<br />
Is this broken, bugged or working as intented since the pet get's bored after a couple minutes Guard here.. ??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Saruton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think it was that way from the beginning. And its reasonable. You die, so the pet hasnt an ower and poofs after a while. It waits about three mins.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Venlail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">bah, personally I think that's crap.  When a player has a pet up, what kind of &quot;mental&quot; link is there, for example to be able to command your pet.  He should have some awareness of your &quot;state&quot;.<br />
<br />
- cast pet<br />
- command pet to.....&lt;insert task here&gt; (sit, attack, guard, etc)<br />
- FD, pets stays for a few minutes, but you could still give commands, and pet will respond.<br />
- cast Invis, pet poof!!  WTF?  Your pet is Undead, all undead mobs see through invis.<br />
- cast Invis to Undead, pet poofs!!  Ok, this make a little more sense, but still....<br />
<br />
You'd figure that there would be some &quot;Mental link&quot; to pets, since animal pets don't speak common, undead pets are, well undead and require &quot;some force&quot; (spells) to control(cast) them.<br />
<br />
Either, imo, FD and invis minimum shouldn't cause pet to poof so quickly, if at all.  Invis to Undead, well too many other arguments.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kizzestra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">According to a recent patch message this issue was fixed. However my pet poofed on me just last night from this so I know it is not fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It's &quot;not broken&quot;, so it can't be fixed.  This is simply the way it has always been.  If SOE doesn't see it as broken (IE: they designed it that way) then they're not going to &quot;fix&quot; it.<br />
<br />
Just get used to the fact that you can't have a pet do all the work for you while you take no risk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Makkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Incorrect, it hasn't always been this way. It was &quot;fixed&quot; when pets were still KoS. Necros would fd, go afk, and their pets would get aggro. Great for factioning or even xp-ing on static spawns the pet could handle.<br />
<br />
Now since the pet gets no aggro it really needs to be fixed. Though you can still /pet attack while fd'd. *shrug*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Khat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I definitely agree that just invising shouldn't cause the pet to poof.  Just like some of the earlier arguments; they are undead.<br />
<br />
There have been a few times where I would have a pet up and decide to invis to med safely.  Every occasion I do this I wonder exactly that, why does he poof?  He can still see me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jabbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">btw, dunno if anyone has ever bothered timing this, but it's 2 minutes from FD to pet poof.  Just Fyi.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Thacker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">As Makkon said, it hasn't always been that way.<br />

It was changed a while ago when Necros would break an area, feign death, and go to bed and then as each mob spawned the pet would kill the mob.  The Necros had no risk involved and didn't even have to be at the computer and could get exp all night long as they slept and that pissed of Verant, so they nerfed it.  I think initially pet insta-died when you feigned, but after a bit of griping that was changed.<br />
<br />
As far as invis, I think that it was done for similar reasons because of exploits, although I can't remember exactly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Find a non-kos mob that cant see inviz, send in pet from a distance and inviz yourself. Pet takes on mob and you don't get aggro, if pet cant handle mob you chain them and inviz between each one. If you run out of mana or components you still don't have aggro, as you are inviz.</div></div><hr />

 You know, I've been wondering about that myself. The whole idea of an undead pet suiciding because it's master goes invisible seemed kind of screwed up.<br />
<br />
The way I always thought it worked was that regular invisibility simply makes it so you can't be seen. But the undead don't really &quot;see&quot; you, they're sensing your life force, something that regular invisibilty can't mask. On the other hand, Invisibilty vs Undead only masks your life force and does nothing to physically obscure you. Which is why when you cast IU, the undead can't see you, but living NPC's as well as other players still can. So if you cast Gather Shadows, your pet, being undead and still able to sense you, should still know exactly where you are. Add to that the magical (mental, spiritual?) link you share with your pet, and you could argue that even IU shouldn't gank ol' Larry.<br />
<br />
But if what Thacker said is true about the Necro exploit (and I'd bet my last bone chip it is), then I can finally see why it works the way it does...sort of. I suppose the reason it never occurred to me was that I never played a Necro, so the idea of my pet ever being able to solo anything that would give me xp also never occurred to me. But why don't they make invis work like FD? Put the pet on a timer and kill it if you stay invised for too long. They could even make up some explanation like &quot;the magical aura that surrounds you and blocks detection of either your physical form or life essence interferes with the link between you and your pet, degrading it over time to the point where it is finally broken.&quot; I'd buy that. Close enough, anyway.<br />
<br />
If they did it that way, you still couldn't let your pet do all your fighting for you while you slept, but you could call a pet at the zone-in (or other SS), park him there, regain your mana (really important for a Troll like me when your pet drains 30% of your mana pool), invis up, run to where you want to be and finally summon your pet. Three minutes should be enough, in most cases. Five would be better.</div></div><hr />
