I understand this named spawns in the place of any static ghost in the Lair of the trapped ones. My question is, can he be up more then once at the same time? wondering if it is worth killing his spawn point closest to zone (third mob down the tunnel) or to keep getting new trials until he just spawns? Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Prevost</div><div class="date">07-12-2004, 10:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know if he spawns in any static ghost spawn, but I've been farming SNLair for a while now. There are two spots within about 30 mobs from the zone-in that he can spawn, however.<br />
<br />
You need to clear between 9-20 mobs (I think one of the roamers in the hall may be a trigger) to spawn the named/phs in zone. In the first hall off the starting room, Rigara can spawn as the third mob in on the right, past the static golem but before the mob before the corner. Then, if you continue through the hall around the left, then to the right down the stairs is a room that has five static spawns.<br />
<br />
The back left corner can spawn Rigara also, my memory fails me, but possibly the front right can too.<br />
<br />
I've killed at least nine Rigara's and not seen the shield. Only the caster neck and bracer.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darkmourn D`Estrellas</div><div class="date">07-12-2004, 05:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been farming that sewer a lot also, and I would say that I'm fairly certain only one of a particular named can be up at a time.  I'm not 100% positive of course, but I have never had the same one up twice, and we send a rogue throughout the dungeon to scout, since tracking blows in there.  So unless you have a rogue to scout, farming a specific spot for him might be a little risky since you might not realize he's already up.  <br />
<br />
He is also the most rare of the 3 named by far, from the expeditions I've done at least.  I've only killed him 3 times as opposed to easily 10-15+ of the other ones.  He dropped the shield one time for me.  I've also had him spawn at that spot in the first hallway described above.  Typically if you kill all of the mobs in the first room, and work into the hallway, by the time you have killed the 3 roamers and made it to the corner past the unslowable golem, the unspawned points will then spawn, or within a kill or two if not.  There is one roamer that spawns that will path to you, so watch for that.<br />
<br />
Good luck.  Still trying for spell haste augs from the stupid fly for people here :(  Talk about rare.  Had one drop the first fly we ever saw, and never again.</div></div><hr />

The EXP version I mean.  I know I can do the Crematory but wasn't sure about this one.  Mobs in the crematory hit for around 600 and named for maybe 900?  Thanks in advance for your thoughts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Prevost</div><div class="date">07-14-2004, 10:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I run my SHD, CLR and BRD for xp in SNLair np. You can pull up to and, theoretically, clear up to the second room that I described since everything can be pulled single with ease (or pacify when you need to split the 2nd room fast). The only problem that I've ever had is low damage groups and repop happening on roamers before getting the named out of the 2nd room.<br />
<br />
I have yet to try to kill a named with just me 3 though. By the time I clear and spawn the named/phs a couple of friends have usually logged on and have come to join me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darkmourn D`Estrellas</div><div class="date">07-14-2004, 10:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Depending upon the gear of all 3, the SK in particular, it could be.  You can pull everything to the zone in spot and be perfectly safe from adds, so it's just a matter of killing enough mobs so that the ph's in the tunnel pop.  The ghost mentioned above can be Rigara, and the roamer can be the Fly.  But that's probably about it, because that place is roamer central.  There are 3 that path through the first hall, plust the 4th that pops around 20 mobs, and if you fight down to the next major room you'll see more.  And they hit harder and faster than mobs in the Crematory.  It's not so much harder you can't do it or anything, I would just be cautious about moving past the zone in until you get the feel of the place.  And that leaves you with the same issue of not knowing if the named spawned somewhere else.<br />
<br />
Give it a shot anyway.  If you die it's not like it's that big of a deal.<br />
<br />
*EDIT*<br />
Forgot to mention, the named are decently harder than the trash mobs, but could be done fairly easily with that 3 box setup.  One thing to note is that the named are snareable, even the Fly, whereas trash flies are immune in that dungeon.  And snare lands fairly easily on the Fly and Larva (haven't done Rigara enough to remember, but I'm pretty sure he's not immune).  So snare them, malos and slow on inc, and have CH started before it gets to you in case slow is resisted.  The Fly and Larva at least even run at 20%.<br />
<br />
I also forgot to mention that gaters suck there, and golems are unslowable.  If the golem decides it wants to shaman debuff/nuke you they are easy...if they don't you'll have to watch it depending on what kind of gear you have.  Golems and slimesnippers (?, the big red beetle thingies) enrage also, so watch out for the pets.</div></div><hr />
