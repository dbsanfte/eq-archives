<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>SerNate</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I posted this the other day on sk forum on Allakhazm's and was told people here would be more help, so I'm just going to paste what I wrote there:<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyone have any stratiges with sk pvp besides the obvious like lifetap,spear, and melee combos. I know to have junkbuffs to gaurd againt dispell. <br />
<br />
What I hate is that the 2 best weapons I have are leach disc and HT disc, but they are good only once an hour or so. So my pvp effectivness is limited to about 1 time an hour unless I have my cleric running around behind me. O and Darkness line never-never lands on players around 65 for me. <br />
<br />
I recently deleveled from 67 back to 65(haven't played in a while to update Magelo) after the Zek merger because there was alot of 70 UBER pk's greifing server. I figure at 65 I stand a decent chance of still progressing and getting a xp group once in a while to get some aa's and gear.</div></div><hr />

Although some threads are vs. a particular class the actual discussion is broader than that...READ THEM</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>SerNate</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Nice Thanks Keevel.<br />
<br />
I still need to know what to do when a Necro can chain lifetap me and sometimes crit for 3k+. While I just start to cast my whimpy lifetaps to offset his, my Hp is gone. Raid buffed I have about 8.5k hp and a good Necro can drop me in under 10 seconds unless healer is on point. With a good healer I can get dots, lifetaps, melle and HT off to finish.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if this is just on Zek with PvP spells but with MR of about 250 you would think that you are safe from snare right? Wrong... I think it's Embracing Dark, but I still get snared about 1/2 (seems like 3/4) the time. And there is nothing worse than not being able to move while a Necro runs around you DoTing and lifetaping you untill you die.<br />
<br />
One on one I seem to do ok vs other classes, but alot of Necros are Brutal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Izabadman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I don't know how much it will help you in an all the time PvP world, but I can give you some tips I learned from Arena and /duel on a PvE server.  <br />
<br />
1. Shadowstep is your friend when rooted or snared.<br />
2. Diamond Skin is actually useful against nukes from other hybrids, clerics, mages, and even to an extent Necros, as the rune portion shortens their return heal by equal amount.<br />
3. Your lifetaps are hybrid hasted.  They may hit for less, but they can hit more often and really, that necro has less hitpoints than you, he's just regenning mana like mad and tapping for more, so you have to offset that.<br />
4. Your pet is GREAT at disrupting casters.<br />
5. Harmshield at the appropriate times can really wreck a caster's day.<br />
6. Get more Magic resistance.<br />
7. Your horse is still pretty fast when snared.<br />
8. Snare pets.<br />
9. OoW poison dots seem to land VERY well, and do substancial damage over short term.  (Blood of Inruku, Blood of Discord) Both stack.<br />
10. Nullify Magic or Cancel Magic will clear up a snare or root.<br />
11. Liching or dotting self will prevent mezzes from sticking for long.<br />
12. Cure disease will clear up shaman and beastlord slows.<br />
<br />
As I said, some of this could be incorrect on a red server, but test it out, play around with it, whatever.  Eventually you will figure out what works best and what doesn't.  From what I hear though, Shadowknights took a giant step down on the PvP food chain with the last major PvP changes, so you'll have to work harder :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>SerNate</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks Izabad, I'm going to rework a few things with my sk. I don't have any of my OoW DoT, lifetaps, or aa abilities like death peace anymore since I deleveled back to 65. I did that to stay out of pk range from overpowered level 70's. Prolly going to stay there for 200 aa's or more not sure yet. My new level 65 pvp spell set going to look something like this:<br />
<br />
1. Nulify Magic<br />
2. Diamond Skin<br />
3. Shadowstep<br />
4. Harmshield<br />
5. Touch of Innoruuk<br />
6. Festering Dark<br />
7. Blood of Hate<br />
8. FD<br />
<br />
I will mem another set simular to this with Clining Dark or Deathly Temptaion in slot 8, and just swap them out when I need them.<br />
<br />
Also I don't think our horses go to quick if you get snared. When snared your horse pretty much goes slow as a walking pace if I remember right. If I get snared the best thing to do is Shadowstep, lifetap and re-diamondskin repete if needed. Then hope snare wears of quick and keep fighting. Or I could just get better resist like you suggested. Either way it seems like alot of work. If anyone has any better ideas let me know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Izabadman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">What does FD do for you in PvP?  It never fools other players.  Does it fool their pet? or you just worried about the &quot;Train army&quot; method of PvP?  Or are you planning on using it to train your opponent?<br />
<br />
Unless you have a reason to need FD for your PvP spell set, I'd suggest dropping in Touch of Volatis in it's place.<br />
<br />
The lifetaps are on separate timers, and having 2 to cast will increase your damage per second from taps as well as your heal per second from taps.  Both have decent resist mods.  I always run 2 different taps on my PvP set, and I don't mem FD, but then I have DP hotkey, so that's part of it.  I also have 9 spell gems.<br />
<br />
Either way, your spell line up looks pretty similar to mine other than that, and I've been fairly successful with it.<br />
<br />
Have fun learning the best ways to whip other people's asses, man.  Good luck, and Good fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Xilerate</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">For PvPing on Bristlebane I always have up...<br />
<br />
1) Harmshield<br />
2) Spear of Decay<br />
3) Spear of Discord<br />
4) Blood of Discord<br />
5) Dark Constriction<br />
6) Blood of Hate<br />
7) Touch of the Devourer<br />
8) Festering Darkness<br />
9) Blood of Inruku<br />
<br />
Depending on who I am fighting determines what all I use for the vast majority.  There isn't any talent on Bristlebane even after the merge except for a select handful so I don't really have to do anything over the top.<br />
<br />
I use Innoruuk's Dark Blessing and usually keep myself self dotted if any Enchanters in the arena.  Whatever self buffs I have available are up and I stack up as much DS as I possibly can.  For casters and Rangers if you chase them for the most part they seem to panic.  Even the better of the bunch make lil mistakes when you chase them disrupting their normal routine.  Soon as I catch em when they try to stop to cast, immediately bash.  Same goes for Rangers, they suck in close range fights unless really well geared.<br />
<br />
DoTs I use a ton, they do however get resisted here and there, but when they do land it pays off on casters.  Other then that they really aren't an issue.  Hehe, just stay close to em.  Only classes that present any challenge to me are Paladins and other SKs.  It always seems to come down to who has a bigger mana pool in the fights I have with Knights if equally geared.<br />
<br />
Warriors I use Harmshield when they cripple disc and that's it for them, there only advantage wasted.  Only other thing I can think of that I have occasionally is the lil clicky dispell stones from potion vendors in inventory to click so you save a spell slot if needed, plus it is a faster casting time if I remember...or the lanterns from Ssra with clickly Pillage Enhancement.<br />
<br />
Not sure if any of this made sense...half asleep.  =/  But yah...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Don't have feign death mem'd, instead get the feign death AA and use that.  Also get mnemonic retention.<br />
<br />
That should give you nine spell slots, none of which are feign death.<br />
<br />
Harmshield is the most important spell to keep mem'd all the time for pvp.  WHY?  Because if you find out that you've got the wrong spells mem'd (ambushed, rooted, no shadowstep, OUCH) you can hit HARMSHIELD and have 18 seconds to sit down and memorize a new spell that you actually want.  If you have the leadership ability &quot;spell awareness&quot; and you see &quot;soandso begins to cast the manaburn spell&quot; you get to hit harmshield and cross your fingers. :)<br />
<br />
At level 70, with touch of the devourer, fury of magic, soul thief, and epic, you can get exceptional heals for 3404 health off one cast of one lifetap in pve (got one for that last night).  Even in pvp that's enough to keep up with the necros when y ou are also slashing them.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Izabadman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">For PvPing on Bristlebane I always have up...<br />
<br />
1) Harmshield<br />
2) Spear of Decay<br />

5) Dark Constriction<br />

7) Touch of the Devourer<br />

9) Blood of Inruku<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm surprised you get spears to land on anyone worth fighting...<br />
<br />
Also I thought all our spears were now on the same refresh timer, meaning memming 2 was kind of pointless.  Am I wrong about that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Deccado</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Each spear's on a separate timer.  I regularly have two up for pvp, with them landing overall about two times every three casts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Izabadman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thanks for the info Decc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Deccado</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Np at all, I get a hell of a lot more useful info here than I put out, so I figured I should start contributing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>GorranVZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I would add aura of darkness to your list.  On zek recourse spells will land in addition all debuffs have a 50% increased effectivness in pvp.  It actually helps landing some spells even though it's not a huge debuff.</div></div><hr />
