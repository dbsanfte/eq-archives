<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kelv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This question has been bugging me for a while, and save a few exceptions, I cannot find a good answer, so I decided to do a little research here.<br />
<br />
Question is, how do you afford playing for 8+ hours a day?<br />
<br />
<br />
I was able to do it for a while when I was running a lanhouse, but then I got robbed, had to shut it down, and now am back to working too many hours and having not even 4 hours of online time avaiable.<br />
<br />
Now excluding kids who live with parents and don´t have to work for cash, just go to school, come back and play till they fall asleep, how do you pull it off?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Visvires</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I dont think most people play 8+ hours a day.<br />
<br />
Even hardcore raiders don't, and those are the most extreme.<br />
<br />
I work and  school full time, amongst other things and raid every night.<br />
<br />
Id say i play tops averaging apprx 6 hours a day, less if you count that friday is typically off for exp nights, or that i miss raids due to RL occasionally.<br />
<br />
You'll always have your people that are 70+ hours weekly, but id imagine the *vast* majority 90% + are playing less then 6 hours a day.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Another thing, and a way I like to look at things, is that for most people, eq is recreation. Just like watching the television, or movies, or jogging, even sleeping. Some people will simply come home from work and play eq until its time for bed, because its what they enjoy doing.. the way you worded your question made it seem like a chore (sorry if im wrong) in reality for alot of people, its just something to do for fun.. its less obvious then it seems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Slinstill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Personally, I pull off playing as much as I do because I am disabled.  However the guild I am in on SH (&lt;Precision Strike&gt;) believes in healthy balance between RL and in game.  We only raid 4 hours a day, and then only 5 days a week, leaving 2 days of &quot;no ob&quot; time.  Our raid hours never change from 8PM-12AM EST.  It's great to know that I could still be in a high end raiding guild (Time + GoD) and be able to pull off a full/part time job if I were not disabled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ghismonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Stormhammer has a definate advantage that way.  No spawn races and such as I understand it.<br />
<br />
I don't think most people play 8hrs a day, either.  If they do, they either don't have a job, can play from work, or choose to spend every minute of their free time in EQ.  After all 8hrs of work + 8hrs of sleep leaves exactly 8hrs left in every day to play EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>tearsin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">work: 4pm - midnight<br />
EQ: 12:30 - 6-7am<br />
sleep: 6-7am - 3:30pm<br />
<br />
repeat<br />
<br />
when EQ is what you do for fun, for free time, for your hobbie, and for your pleasure... when you don't care to make friends, don't like watching tv, hate going outside, and avoid leaving the house at all costs... it's not very hard to pull off.</div></div><hr />

I dont really keep track of my play time I just play when i feel like it. If anyone sets down and says okay 6 hours or bust every i doubt they will last that long.<br />
I enjoy going to the bar with my girlfriend a\ or going bowling or skating or whatever. twenty years ago people were just sitting and staring at  teleivion screen six or seven hour s a night noone said is that all you do ?<br />
I do not understand what makes people think i have to justify what i do and ow i spend my time. If your missing work or cutting class  or ignoring your spouse family and friends then eq is a problem. just as any other thing people do to mess those things up. <br />
it amazes me what some people call a &quot;life&quot; and justify it or try and feel better about themselves by critisizing how others spend theirs.<br />

This gives me afternoons to play and nights to raid (only 3 raids a week tho).  So I get plenty of time to play EQ if I want to, but I usually dont go over 6 hours a day, it's just too dull.  Besides, it gives me plenty of time to do shit, even though I cant really stay out since I have to get up at 5am every weekday, and I raid saturday nights.  pretty much cuts my all night drinking binges down to Fridays only~</div></div><hr />

I don't even bother with trying to &quot;keep up&quot; in this game anymore. I like to raid and all, kill big shit but to be honest I'd rather get a blow job/laid then worry about how fast I get to time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Scaramanga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">For those that don't want to play 60 hours per week,  why not have a time-limited server?

<br />
Face it, EQ is competitive in a lot of ways, but some &quot;win&quot; because they can and do play 8 or 10 hours per day, while others are lucky to be able to fit in 2 or 3 hours for 5 days a week.  <br />

The fact of the matter is that every server is wide open for a character to be on-line continuously, so why not have ONE that limits playtime?  <br />

That is a stupid idea, next up you are there to organize the time-limited sportmatches/olympics for people that dont have the time to train. Some will allways be better, have more time then you, deal with it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I guess you are unfamiliar with basketball, football, hockey, soccer, water polo, wrestling, boxing and any number of other &quot;sportsmatches/olympics&quot; where there is a set time limit for competition.  After 60 minutes of football, the game is over, and if you are behind you can't just keep playing because you want to.<br />
<br />
How about a poker analogy?  If you've ever played poker for money, you know you cannot win against somebody that has 1000 times as much money as you do IF they are allowed to use all their money.  Somebody with unlimited funds can buy every pot, they will never be bluffed, and eventually they will win.  However, when they play poker tournaments, you are NOT allowed to use all your money.  Everybody pays the same entry fee, and that is the money they have to start with.  You just can't add $100,000 to your starting funds because you have it.  <br />
<br />
EQ players do not have equal time available to play.  If I start the week at level 65, play for 30 hours during the week and pick up 20 AA's, and another player starts the week at 65, plays 60 hours and picks up 40AA's, that doesn't necessarily make them a better player, it may mean they have less real world obligations. <br />
<br />
I am all for those that can play 60 or 80 hours a week.  Your life, do what you will, enjoy.  I certainly didnt' expect any hard core raiders or 60 hour per week players to think this was a good idea.  But I believe there are far more players in the 20-40 hour per week range than there are in the 60-plus hours per week range.  And again note I am NOT advocating that all servers have limited play time.  I'm just curious as to whether there are enough players to support one server that had limited play time, while you would be free to play as much as you like on the other 30+ servers.<br />
<br />
I also don't see why it should matter to you at all if it doesn't affect your gameplay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Interesting concept, but I think I would disagree with it.<br />
<br />
Raiders need casual players and casual players need raiders.<br />
<br />
1) I need raiders on my server to go get those nice &quot;droppable&quot; items and keep putting them up for sale in the bazaar. If there are not enough raiders doing their thing, prices for level 65 spells, windblades, velium gemmed weapons, war crested rings, etc will never come down in price. <br />
<br />
2) Raiders are a great source of knowledge...they love to parse, they write up different methods for killing named stuff...all things I do not have time to do....and guess what...casuals are killing the named too...we just kill the big stuff from 3 expansions ago...so we blow the dust off the old write-ups and tada...info.<br />
<br />
3) Raiders need casual players...guess who farms all those bone chips, meat, spider silks, etc. <br />
<br />
4) Casual players sometimes change into Raiders...we are the &quot;feeder source&quot; to keep their raiding guilds filled. Also, we are a home for those raiders that have &quot;life changes&quot; and no longer can raid.<br />
<br />
Both groups need each other, which is why issues of balance and game interest need to involve high end, low end, raiders, casuals, etc.</div></div><hr />

Yes, but there isn't a time set on the practicing you do before the competition. In EQ analogy that would be leveling and gathering AA = practice, raid = competition.<br />
<br />
I still think it's a stupid idea to make limited time servers. It has absolutely no real use besides the fact that there are people that can feel all uber cause they fill up all the time and others dont, just like on a regular server where people use more time then others.<br />
<br />
So perhaps you dont feel uber enough, is that the point you are trying to make.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ahhh, so in your view, only raiders are competing.  Interesting.  So much for all that single group content, and all those quests that can be accomplished without 71 of your closest friends.  <br />
<br />
And this is precisely my point.  Obviously there are plenty that feel as you do, and there are plenty of servers for your type.  I still don't see why you have a problem with others choosing a different method of play.  We have a roleplay server that limits the number of characters, and I seem to remember a competition on one server where you only got one death.  Stormhammer folks get different benefits, and they pay more for it.  Would you understand better if I told you I would be willing to pay more to be on a limited time server?  I would be willing to finance the server and support out of my own pocket for part of the profits, as I personally believe there are a large number of people that would prefer to play on the type of server I propose.<br />
<br />
Using your logic, I could say that people that don't have a life can feel uber by spending all their free time playing a game.  A Time-geared SK, along with about $2.00 give or take, will get you a Big Mac at any participating McDonalds.  It is no more fair for me to accuse 60-hour per week players of having no life than it is for you to claim that those that prefer a different style of play don't feel &quot;uber&quot; enough.<br />
<br />
Croaakk, I also disagree with your premise.  Raiders don't need casuals at all.  It may take them longer to get tradeskill items, but they certainly don't need casuals.  Casuals have no need for raiders either.  Learning to beat a mob is not that difficult, those with average intelligence can figure out an encounter without doing research on the web.  And as has been pointed out so often in other threads, you don't need gear that you can't earn unless you are just interested in twinking your character.  Will it take you longer to get those Valorium rings or a WMBS?  Sure.  But can you still do it without some uber raiding guild selling it to you.  Most certainly.</div></div><hr />

How would this time limited server really benefit you?  They're not going to develop special gimp content that you can kill faster just because you're on a time limited server.  You'll still fight the same mobs and have the same gear (or less because your bazaar will have less high end stuff in it).  You might be able to be the best on your server a little easier because you can now play as much as everyone else but as soon as you come to the message boards, you'll still be way behind everyone playing on a normal server.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What gimp content are you talking about?  You mean gimping named mobs in GoD so, what, 200 knights out of 400,000 or so players can tank content because they want to?  That kind of gimping?  Or the gimp content that allows people to blow through an epic by using MQ's, or gearing up by buying stuff from Yantis rather than earning it?  Or the gimp content that allows you to go from 1-65 fighting reds and powerleveling, knowing you can never lose a corpse or encounter a nasty CR?  Did you ever stop to think that for some people it is not all about getting to end game ASAP, but for them it is about experiencing as many zones and quests as possible along the way?  <br />
<br />
Some people like an all you can eat buffet, some are happy ordering a set amount of food from the menu.  Both types of customer get what they want.  Why this is so hard for you to understand is beyond me.  Is the better question how does a time limited server harm you?  If it doesn't, why do you care?<br />

Do you understand that many of the pre-PoP mobs that are challenging and rewarding for non-raiders are routinely ganked by a ubers when they don't have raids scheduled?  That some of us work on things like VP keys and need a Trak's tooth, and we have to hope that 3 or 4 ubers don't run by and take out a mob that is trivial to them just to see if they can?  If there are enough people willing to pay NOT to be bothered by raiders having a little fun, why does it matter to you?<br />

In any case, since my message is directed at the players that have no desire to play 60 hours a week, I may be posting it on the wrong board.  Many that post here are either at or near end game content, they will always want as much time as possible in-game.  <br />
<br />
In the end it will come down to good old capitalism.  If there are enough people willing to pay for a different type server, Sony may listen.  If not, they won't.</div></div><hr />

I never raid yet I can usually find any mob I'm interested in killing if I go look for it.  Occasionally someone else is already there killing it but if I just wait until the next night, I can generally find the same mob.<br />

I honestly don't think ubers ganking mobs is as big a problem as you make it out to be.  It's not on my server anyway, maybe your server is just overcrowded or full of jerks.<br />
<br />
I don't really care if they create a time-limited server.  It won't effect me at all.  I just really don't think it's going to create an atmosphere all that much different than what you normally see.  You'll still see people who play as many hours as the server allows forming &quot;uber&quot; guilds and those people will farm non-raid content when they aren't raiding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Jupke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">And I still dont see the need for a time limited server...you want to play casual, not do any high end content that takes a lot of time getting there. What is keeping you ? <br />
Is the low end competition too hard for you too so you want to move to a server where everybody gets their own content ? <br />
Dont blame it on the &quot;uber&quot; players to kill off your mobs...blame it on the players geared and playing like you to do that cause the raiders are doing what they need to do to reach the top...raiding high end.<br />

On a time limited server you will have those people too, they will kill everything they can in the limited time they get and you will be stuck there with nothing, just like a regular server. Or do you really think somethings are gonna change cause there is a limit on time.</div></div><hr />
