<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Moonnyt</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 08:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just happened the other day .. I tought I would post here. Any other servers that have had people awake the sleeper?<br />
<br />
This is from a post on my guild site: <br />
<br />
A very small faction in the guild Order of Redemption apparantly awoke the sleeper last night. A lot of OOR didn't even know about it. 8 people got tired of everyone getting ST loot and woke the sleeper, screwing Fennin Ro. <br />
<br />
And here's a quote from Veturi's boards listing the effects of the sleeper. (Why should you be concerned? Should you? Read below...)<br />
Quote: The Waking of the Sleeper, and his subsequent Velious Rampage, will, and did have the Following Permanent Effects on our Server.<br />
<br />
- PERMANENT EFFECTS -<br />
<br />
- The Sleeper Escapes Sleepers Tomb and is gone. (Rumours of him fleeing to Luclin exist, but no one really knows if he has a &quot;place&quot; in the game anymore.<br />
<br />
- The four Warders that were posted to Guard his Sleeping Body are Perma-killed (Will NEVER Exist on our server Again)<br />
<br />
- These are Four Dragons of Varying Strength who did have loot tables that are now lost to our server, Yes, some items are permanently Lost -<br />
<br />
- Several new quests are opened as a Result of this for NEW Items, some of which are AS GOOD or possible better than some of the Warder Loots. -<br />
<br />
- Primal Weapons now Drop off Named Golems in Sleepers Tomb, These Golems always existed, BUT did not drop Primal, they now do. While these guys do not pony up as many primals per kill as the Warders did, they are much easier Mobs to Kill. Effectively, Primals are now rarer drop, but off much easier mobs. They will still be flowing onto the Server Population. - Note: You Still Need a Tomb Key to get into the Tomb to Kill the Golem to Loot the Primals.<br />
<br />
- TEMPORARY EFFECTS -<br />
<br />
Kerafrym (The Sleeper - A Rumoured Level 75 - 99 Dragon who is Effectively Un-killable) Goes on a TEMPORARY Rampage in Velious. Long Story Short - This Dragon, a Plasmatic Dragon, is a mix of two different colours of Dragons that mated and is a &quot;Mutant&quot; Offspring. He is so powerful, and insane, that all other Dragons Feared his existence and trapped him in a Magic Sleep that kept his mind separate from his body. When he wakes, he is enraged about his Incarceration and Kills EVERYTHING in Sleepers Tomb (PC's, Mobs, EVERYTHING) He then moves on to Skyshrine and Kills EVERYTHING there. When Skyshrine is Sufficiently Dead, he Despawns and &quot;flees&quot; Velious.<br />
<br />
-- Note.. there was quite a collection of people who met and waited in the Pool Room in Skyshrine for the Express Purpose of Seeing the Sleeper and getting killed.<br />
<br />
The short term effects are that Skyshrine Gets Completely Cleared by the Sleeper and he Kills Yelinak.. ONCE.. Not Permanently, but once.<br />
<br />
Within a Week (Yelinak's Spawn time) all of Skyshrine will be Re-popped and back to normal.<br />
<br />
-RUMOURS TO BE DISPELLED-<br />
<br />
The Sleeper kills NO Kunark Dragons.<br />
<br />
The Sleeper does NOT Kill Lady Vox or Lord Negafen.<br />
<br />
The Sleeper being awakened DOES NOT Affect the Epic Weapon Quests AT ALL. Epic Weapons are no different than before and no Harder to Gain.<br />
<br />
The Sleeper DOES NOT Randomly Wander Velious killing Mobs and PC's indiscriminately... He is Gone.. possibly to NEVER be seen again. (Unless VI adds more Content and uses him again)<br />
<br />
And a quote from the SoK Forums, re-explaining why this was such a dumbass thing to do: <br />
<br />
Quote: Actually it is bad, it was greed by a few to deny the rest of the server a chance at the encounter and the drops that will never be seen by anyone again from this point forward. Primal will still drop and off of easier mobs but will be rare and some pieces are very very rare. My friends Whyll and Idari will never ever be able to loot a gnome mask. Yori will never loot his SoD and ill never get a shroud. Its not a big diaster, but what was the point.<br />
<br />
Monks - no shroud of longevity for you!<br />
Rogues/bards - no gnome mask for you!</div></div><hr />

And everyone has whined about it.  And I honestly doubt 8 people woke the sleeper.  <br />
<br />
So far you've made 1 obvious mistake, and 1 assumed mistake.  8 people could not wake the sleeper, even if it was just the first warder up.  And I honestly doubt the woke him because they didn't want people getting sleeper loots.<br />
<br />
Plus what will complaining about it do?  He's gone, whining and chewing out a guild will result in nothing but you making an ass of your self.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Moonnyt</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 08:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My post is not a flame. did you read it?? I'm presenting facts that happened on my server and asking what other servers had the sleeper wake-up? Not everyone knows what happens when the sleeper awakes.  That would be like me thinking that everybody knows that Uuno Klami died in a boating accident. Very ostentatious of you to make that sweeping statement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brael</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 08:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, nanzata I could see being killed with 8 people hes not all that strong, first time my guild killed him (LONG time ago) we had 14 people, 3 or 4 primals, needed priceless still even, oh and you cna forget about DB or lifetaps on him... new armor, higher hp tanks, aa skills, easier resists, bane, i see him being killed with 8</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dzenith</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 08:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If warders 2-4 were already down from a previous killing, 8 people of the right classes probably could take out the first warder, thus releasing the sleeper.  However I too find it unlikely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mardoc of Saryrn</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 09:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">True, didn't think about first warder.  I still stand by whining about it does nothing.  Presenting the facts does nothing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paynreaver</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 10:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its true. Im on fennin ro, and 8-12 ish people DID wake the sleeper. Their guild had been raiding ST all day and had ganked all the warders but the 1st one. They stayed behind and ganked the last WITHOUT the permission of the guild leaders. These few people have now screwd THOUSANDS of possible ST-raiders (including me). Yes, its just a game, but its the reasoning behind it that i care about: These people do not give a flying shit about anyone besides themselves. Well, to you few, i hope to Lord Thule that your names will be known throughout Fennin Ro for what you have done, and i hope it gets so damn bad (no guild, no groups, no acceptance...) that you are forced to leave my server. yeah, im not near the level to go ST raiding, but i have been wanting to for months. Its my #2 place i wanna go, and now many people just plain wont wanna go. <br />
<br />
Thanks a lot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
heh.. you did in fact think of the first warder.. you just did'nt wanna stand by your opnion. hehe  =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brael</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 10:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">payn, when you reach that level of the game where your doing st warders are just another mob to kill... nothing special about them, all it does is speed st raids up, and in all honesty considering the sk loot in st, all freeing the sleeper did was benefit you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">trun</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 11:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It was in fact nanz that was taken down by a few ppl. The only problem with sleeper being awaken on the server is that it was pretty much an agreement between the two guilds that kill ventani that at least one warder be left up at all times. Last night however, after one guild cleared 2,3 and 4; a small group of one guild snuck into st anon and killed 1. They did it without the knowledge of their own guild.  <br />
<br />
It's a blow for guilds that haven't had a chance to kill warders, but  most people don't really care that it actually happened, just the way it happened.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wyrmwood B'Dynn</div><div class="date">04-04-2002, 12:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">About time you guys let the sleeper out. I think only a few other servers like some of the Zeks and FV have not let it out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">synnoira</div><div class="date">04-04-2002, 12:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">sleeper got woken on morell thule a while ago<br />
personally i thought it was very cool, just sad i couldn't get into skyshrine to get whacked by him myself<br />
sounds like the circumstances on your server are ethically questionable which is very sad given that it's a one-off thing, i hope you can sanction those folk, but my reaction was &quot;good for them&quot; when i heard the resident ubers on MT had done it<br />
and i was under the impression as brael says that it makes primal easier in some ways to get</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">trun</div><div class="date">04-04-2002, 01:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Primals are easier in the sense that you just need to kill the normal crap for them, it's just that they don't have as high a drop rate as the warders. Only things that are gone for good are the nome masks, sods, etc. Like I said, it's not really a big deal that the sleeper was awaken, just the circumstances surrounding how he was awaken.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Suse</div><div class="date">04-04-2002, 02:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Many guildmates discuss this issue after sleeper was awaken. Hard to say this is a good or bad news. However, At least a bad side on it, we can't watch the first look of the Warders coz we are heading to ST raid soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lord Vedar</div><div class="date">04-04-2002, 05:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I personaly think its screwed up Verant did the Sleeper &quot;encounter&quot; as half assed as they did, But my Server was one of the early sleeper wakes. My guild still gets a ton of Primals and its easy. Like someone said earlier for SK's its prob a good thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dustwyrm</div><div class="date">04-04-2002, 05:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sleeper was woken on Tallon Zek in a similar situation. Guild A wasn't getting anything while Guild B farmed the hell out of the warders. Guild A sneaked into ST and killed the last remaining warder (not the 4th). Corpse camping of Guild A by Guild B then resulted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CelestinePDM</div><div class="date">04-04-2002, 06:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love corpse camping them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draconin</div><div class="date">04-04-2002, 02:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As one of the SKs in Order of Redemption I can tell you that a majority of the guild was extremely angry at these people.  Fennin Ro has had the ability to kill Ventani (Warder 4, the hardest) for a long time, the 2-3 guild capable had always agreed to keep a warder up and not make the mistake many other servers had made.  There are at least 8 shrouds on fennin, most on any server as far as I know.  It was somthing that many were proud of that we strayed from the norm and rebeled against a very lame event Verant came up with.<br />
<br />
The exact wakening went as followed, we ported up earlier that day and killed warder 2,3,4 as we normally do.  Around 4am 8-13 members, including our own leader went back to ST and killed warder 1, as several of you suspected.  The aftermath the next morning was a swift breakup of the guild, a majority reforming Defenders of Akanon made up of those that were disgusted by them going behind the majoritys back in such a selfish way, effectively ending fennin ro's record of leaving warders up for all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Syfon</div><div class="date">04-04-2002, 02:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i was under the impression that some loot in ST was on Warder loot tables only. Therefore waking the sleeper permanently eliminates some loot from the game. I know there is supposed to be some sweet monk robe and of course the gnome mask (just a fun trinket reall?) but guessing from these posts none of the warder loot is really sk usuable?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">trun</div><div class="date">04-04-2002, 02:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shield of the clawed guardian, back/shield for pal/sk off ventani. Thas bout it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mardoc of Saryrn</div><div class="date">04-04-2002, 04:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm sorry for stating I didn't consider the first warder, I have no short term memory and assumed I had the same opinion then. (heh I know bad assumption)  But seriously, I had a great time when sleeper was woken on my server, bristlebane at the time.  Items were lost, who cares.  BEtter stuff exist, outside of some warder loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shakeera</div><div class="date">04-04-2002, 04:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Triton awoke the Sleeper a while back on our server, and unlike on most other servers it seems , they were flooded with congratulations and applause.  There were a couple of people that protested, and their response was:  We did it, because we could.  Can't really argue with that.<br />
<br />
If the 8 people that awoke the sleeper on Fennin did it dishonorably by deceiving their own guild and breaking multi-guild agreements, then that's wrong.  But if a guild is mighty enough to complete the warder encounters and awaken the sleeper on their own, they should be commended for it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ah, you make it sound so much worse than it really is.  ;-)<br />
<br />
Made for a very interesting episode on the server.  BTW, I hadn't heard any reports of you yourself CC'ing.  You've always been a pretty good sport in general, your statement here kinda has me puzzled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Treznor</div><div class="date">04-04-2002, 06:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When we awoke the sleeper it was hell of a buzz, we done it with the intention of waking the sleeper.  The night we finally did it, was prolly the most enjoyable night in eq that i've ever had, every other accomplishment in game so far does'nt come close.  It does'nt really screw anyone else in game as primals still drop of the golems, and it only makes ST alot easier for smaller guilds to get primals.<br />
<br />
Yes some of the loot is taken out of the game like SoD's sk/pal shield and the monk bp.  Its not as bad as ppl make out, trying to turn everything into a massive drama.  Its the way the game was designed if you dont like it you dont have to play it, deal with it and move on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draconin</div><div class="date">04-04-2002, 07:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes of course we'll get over it, but the point is the 8-13 that used the rest of the guild to kill Ventani then went behind our backs to wake sleeper are probably done with their guild days on Fennin.  Either they'll ebay, switch servers or live as outcast for the rest of their days.  Something that big shoulda been a guild event not 2 groups looking for a quick rush early in the morning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kamiken</div><div class="date">04-04-2002, 08:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm Draconin I know that they did it in spite of what was said and I know that many are angry, but the one thing I hope that comes out of this is the chance for other people on the server to get keys, since the mobs dropping them were camped non stop by the top guilds.  I do know they will continue to be camped big time, but I am hoping the compitition won't be as crazy for them anymore...might be better for the server but crazy for a while while smaller guilds trying to get primal from weaker mobs....no clue just trying to see how this pans out.<br />
<br />
Kamiken</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CelestinePDM</div><div class="date">04-06-2002, 06:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The end result of releasing the sleeper can not be considered anything but bad for a server. The named golems that drop primal post-sleeper are no easier than the first 3 warders and drop considerably less loot. The only people that &quot;benefit&quot; are those with warder loot since their char might have a higher value.<br />
<br />
Nobody benefits from a nerfed zone. I corpse camp the guild that took the easy warder we left up (releasing the sleeper) because they did it to spite us.</div></div><hr />
