At the moment it looks like me+cleric+necro versus wizard+druid+enchanter. My plan was to go for the wizzy first as he's the most dangerous, but as i'm far from being a pvp expert, any hints or tips would be most welcome.<br />

Take out the Druid first, if hes dead no one can get healed, you can use dots on the Enchanter/Wizard provided you can land them to get in some damage behind their runes and without a healer they'll be doomed.  Your cleric should be able to keep you up np although they'll probally go all out on it but thats what a full minute of invuls, invul procs, and TotD is for right?  Once they're without a healer take out the Enchanter and keep the Wizard busy with worrying too much about staying alive to risk getting into the fight, besides the fact that he'll probally be oom this time and not a threat the Enchanter can run you guys oom so hes more of a threat than the Wizard, heals&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;damage in pvp so if that cleric has some mana the Wizard can't kill you guys.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dhantes</div><div class="date">06-28-2004, 07:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looking at your gear im betting dot's aren't gonna land. Necro will probably get stuck chaining resisted lifetaps and biggest contribution will probaly be his pet. Clerics is your strongest link. Have the cleric spam SR on himself and be watching out for a quick MB. If they are smart they will go all out on the cleric at opening.<br />
<br />
As for what you guys should do. How many instants do you have? If you guys have less then 3 instants i would maybe think of going all out chaining ToI+ToV+ (i'd say zbite but blue server =\) and meleeing the chanter to 75% as fast as you can and dropping the ht on the enchanter not stripping you of buffs is a good thing. Druid might be a good first target also because without a healer they should drop fast. You still have the much better healer if you drop their chanter and then proceed to work on the druid. Though depending on how the encounter goes if the druid isn't dieing you might want to switch to the wizard...the wizard puts out much more dps then the druid and also will drain the druids manapool faster healing the wiz. Also might be easier to kill the wiz even with druid healing then it would be to kill teh druid spam healing himself. Anyways whichever one is left clean up. <br />
<br />
Have cleric SR/SC everyone even you. Make sure the cleric knows that he is to chain SR himself at lke 80-90% hp to avoid MB. Might also want to watch out for a sneak MB on yourself cuz without you your group may not have the dps to kill them either.<br />

Oh yah Ro's something overwrites SoV.</div></div><hr />
