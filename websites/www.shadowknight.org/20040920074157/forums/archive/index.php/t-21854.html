<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">LOL diablo 2 expansion 1.10 was supposed to be out for almost 2 years if not longer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Forpar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I doubt they would let anyone beta test for a full year so I'm guessing 4th quarter or early next year.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Paynreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It will be in production until its done, and I for one fucking love Blizzard for that. They have the complete opposite mentality of SOE, instead of shoving half baked products out the door they will tell you to fucking be patient and then release a game (late) thats absoloutly top-notch.<br />
<br />
You can depend on Blizzard to do a good job.<br />
<br />
Waiting &gt; Shitty Products</div></div><hr />

I've been fairly impressed with Blizzard's games in the past. They always seem to be rock solid, in all ways but one.<br />
<br />
They've always been very hackable, and as a result have been almost unplayable because of hackers.<br />
<br />
Why do we think that WoW will be any different?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Because the games being hosted on their servers vs on other players.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lizarde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well, WoW should be less hackable.  For one thing, Diablo and similar games keep game data on the client and only use the server to transmit and organize it.  So you don't need to bother with hacking the server.<br />
<br />
WoW and similar games keep the important data on the server.  I figure that the technologies that keep games like EQ (relatively) safe from hacking will be applied to WoW.  I won't claim that any server is hack-proof, but there's a big difference between hacking D2 and hacking WoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Madrone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The more information that is clientside the more hackable a game is, SC/Diablo etc had a lot of client side stuff, if you dont think EQ is hackable, your just well... wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Correct but its not as easy to hack a game like EQ, UO, WoW etc as it is to hack something like Starcraft.  Besides the difficulty in it, theres not nearly as many people in EQ that hack stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Madrone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Definatly, I shoulda explained better,<br />
<br />
Ya I shoulda explained it better, main point is its not that the games are hackable because they are blizzard, its because they are mostly peer to peer games, a lot more information is avaiable to both your computer and the hacker, its not as much because they are blizzard games, but because blizzard games are popular.<br />
<br />
MMORPG's client/server, your computer doesnt have as much information, and therse not as much avaiable to the hackers, so by their very nature they are much harder to &quot;hack&quot; (in addition character info is generally serverwide, so you can't just get items outa nowhere generally)<br />
<br />
But thats not to say that WoW, or any MMoRPG wont be hacked, because they are, but not as common as in Peer to Peer or games hosted on clients computers</div></div><hr />
